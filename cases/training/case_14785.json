          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: Defendants Cummings, Garbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and Bhangu's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages concerning Plaintiffs' state law claims is pending. (ECF Nos. 61, 73.) Since the parties have not briefed certain issues, counsel shall be prepared to address the following questions during oral argument, which is reset for 9:00 a.m. on April 22, 2013. The hearing scheduled for April 8, 2013 is vacated. Further, each party is granted leave to respond to the following questions in writing in advance of the hearing by filing a response on the docket at counsel's earliest convenience. Please explain each response. For Plaintiffs: 1. In Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109 (1945), the Supreme Court states that it is \"immaterial whether [state] statutes... are characterized either as 'substantive' or 'procedural.'\" Instead, when deciding whether a state statute applies in federal court, what matters is whether the statute \"significantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.\" Id. Does § 425.13 \"significantly affect the result of a litigation?\" 2.California Civil Procedure Code § 425.13 states that a motion under § 425.13 must be made within two years after filing suit or nine months before the matter is first set for trial, whichever is earlier. Since a federal court deciding state claims \"applies the substantive law of the state, including the state's statute of limitations,\" Albano v. Shea Homes Ltd. P'ship, 634 F.3d 524, 530 (9th Cir. 2011), why is § 425.13's limitations period inapplicable in federal court? 3. Erie's \"twin aims\" are \"'discouragement of forum−shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.'\" Goldberg v. Pac. Indem. Co., 627 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir. 2010). Would it encourage forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws to waive § 425.13's requirements for plaintiffs litigating in federal, but not state, court? For Defendants Cummings, Garbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and Bhangu: 1. In College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 4th 704, 718, 717 (1994), the California Supreme Court states that § 425.13 is a \"procedural protection\" that was not \"intended to change the substantive elements of punitive damages claims.\" How does this pronouncement affect your argument that § 425.13 is a substantive provision? 2. What state substantive law is § 425.13 so \"'intimately bound up'\" with so that it is \"an integral component of California's substantive state policy?\" Feldman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 660, 66667 (9th Cir. 2003). 3. During a § 425.13 hearing, the court cannot \"weigh the merits of the claim or consider its likely outcome at trial.\" Coll. Hosp., Inc., 8 Cal. 4th at 719. Does the limited scope of review under § 425.13 make the statute less like a substantive provision and more like a procedural regulation of the \"manner and the means by which a [plaintiff may] recover\"? See York, 326 U.S. at 109. Ordered by Judge Garland E. Burrell, Jr on 04/03/13. (Dankof, E) (Entered: 04/03/2013)"

Nunley on 6/28/2013: The Court is in receipt of Defendants' Ex Parte Application to Stay Order of Magistrate Judge Pending Ruling on Motion for Reconsideration. (ECF No. 95 .) Plaintiffs oppose the ex parte application. (ECF No. 98 .) The Court finds that Defendants have not demonstrated that they are without fault in creating the alleged crisis that requires ex parte relief, or that the crisis occurred as a result of excusable neglect. See Mission Power Engineering Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 492 (C.D. Cal. 1995), cited approvingly in Manpower Inc. v. Slingshot Connections LLC, No. 2:12−cv−01069 JAM KJN, 2012 WL 3561974, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2012). Defendants have been on notice of the Magistrate Judge's order since June 14, 2013, and only bring their ex parte request at the eleventh hour prior to their deadline to comply. Defendants' ex parte application for a stay is DENIED. With respect to the request for reconsideration, Plaintiffs are to file their opposition to Defendants' request in accordance with Local Rule 303. No reply briefs are permitted.

Plaintiffs oppose the ex parte application. (ECF No. 98 .) The Court finds that Defendants have not demonstrated that they are without fault in creating the alleged crisis that requires ex parte relief, or that the crisis occurred as a result of excusable neglect. See Mission Power Engineering Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 492 (C.D. Cal. 1995), cited approvingly in Manpower Inc. v.

Defendants have been on notice of the Magistrate Judge's order since June 14, 2013, and only bring their ex parte request at the eleventh hour prior to their deadline to comply. Defendants' ex parte application for a stay is DENIED. With respect to the request for reconsideration, Plaintiffs are to file their opposition to Defendants' request in accordance with Local Rule 303. No reply briefs are permitted.

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: Defendants Cummings, Garbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and Bhangu's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages concerning Plaintiffs' state law claims is pending. (ECF Nos. 61, 73.) Since the parties have not briefed certain issues, counsel shall be prepared to address the following questions during oral argument, which is reset for 9:00 a.m. on April 22, 2013. The hearing scheduled for April 8, 2013 is vacated. Further, each party is granted leave to respond to the following questions in writing in advance of the hearing by filing a response on the docket at counsel's earliest convenience. Please explain each response. For Plaintiffs: 1. In Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109 (1945), the Supreme Court states that it is \"immaterial whether [state] statutes... are characterized either as 'substantive' or 'procedural.'\" Instead, when deciding whether a state statute applies in federal court, what matters is whether the statute \"significantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.\" Id. Does § 425.13 \"significantly affect the result of a litigation?\" 2.California Civil Procedure Code § 425.13 states that a motion under § 425.13 must be made within two years after filing suit or nine months before the matter is first set for trial, whichever is earlier. Since a federal court deciding state claims \"applies the substantive law of the state, including the state's statute of limitations,\" Albano v. Shea Homes Ltd. P'ship, 634 F.3d 524, 530 (9th Cir. 2011), why is § 425.13's limitations period inapplicable in federal court? 3. Erie's \"twin aims\" are \"'discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.'\" Goldberg v. Pac. Indem. Co., 627 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir. 2010). Would it encourage forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws to waive § 425.13's requirements for plaintiffs litigating in federal, but not state, court? For Defendants Cummings, Garbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and Bhangu: 1. In College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 4th 704, 718, 717 (1994), the California Supreme Court states that § 425.13 is a \"procedural protection\" that was not \"intended to change the substantive elements of punitive damages claims.\" How does this pronouncement affect your argument that § 425.13 is a substantive provision? 2. What state substantive law is § 425.13 so \"'intimately bound up'\" with so that it is \"an integral component of California's substantive state policy?\" Feldman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 660, 66667 (9th Cir. 2003). 3. During a § 425.13 hearing, the court cannot \"weigh the merits of the claim or consider its likely outcome at trial.\" Coll. Hosp., Inc., 8 Cal. 4th at 719. Does the limited scope of review under § 425.13 make the statute less like a substantive provision and more like a procedural regulation of the \"manner and the means by which a [plaintiff may] recover\"? See York, 326 U.S. at 109. Ordered by Judge Garland E. Burrell, Jr on 04/03/13. (Dankof, E) (Entered: 04/03/2013)"

In the operative Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that \n17 the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Prasad’s serious medical needs – to wit, \n18 a life-threatening infection – during his detention at the Jail and through his discharge from \n19 Rideout Memorial Hospital back to the the Jail on January 26, 2011, and that Mr. Prasad’s \n20 life could have been saved had he received timely and needed treatment.  See Dkt. \n21 No. 137, passim.  Plaintiffs alleged liability on the part of individual defendants and \n22 supervisors and Monell liability on the part of defendant Sutter County.  See id. \n23 11.  Each of the twenty-one named defendants brought a motion to dismiss \n24 and/or strike.  See Dkt. Nos. 52, 56, 61.  This Court denied in whole or in part all of those \n25 motions, finding that the then-operative complaint stated claims against each named \n26 defendant.  See Dkt. No. 105. \n27 12.  No reports of physicians or other similar experts have been prepared in this \n28 case that relate to any injuries of any of the Minor Plaintiffs.  See Bien Decl. ¶ 8. \n[1145271-4]    3 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE AND FOR \nORDERS TO DEPOSIT MONEY INTO BLOCKED ACCOUNTS \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 140   Filed 04/10/14   Page 5 of 11\n \n1 13.  On January 20, 2013, the parties commenced mediation of the case with \n2 Judge Raul Ramirez (Ret.).  Plaintiff Mary Prasad, as well as representatives of each \n3 defendant and counsel for each party, were present at this mediation.  See Prasad Decl. \n4 ¶ 10; Bien Decl. ¶ 10.  All discovery in the case closed on February 10, 2014 (see Dkt. No. \n5 126), at which point the parties had conducted 21 total depositions and exchanged \n6 thousands of pages of discovery.  Bien Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12.  As a result of the mediation and \n7 subsequent negotiations, Plaintiffs reached agreements to settle with each of the \n8 defendants.  See Prasad Decl. ¶ 11; Bien Decl. ¶ 11. \n9 DETAILS OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT ALLOCATION \n10 14.  Plaintiffs have entered into settlement agreements by which they will receive \n11 a total sum of $824,999 in compensation for all Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries in this action.  \n12 See Prasad Decl. ¶ 11; Bien Decl.

No. 103) applied in full to cover the \n19 remainder of RBGG’s costs incurred in this action (see Bien Decl. ¶ 12); \n20 c.  $10,386.59 to Mary Prasad to reimburse her for expenses she and her \n21 husband incurred associated with Nathan Prasad’s funeral and burial (see Prasad Decl. \n22 ¶ 13); \n23 d.  $1,601.50 to pay the probate attorney who established the estate of \n24 Nathan Prasad and secured Mary Prasad’s appointment as administrator of the estate prior \n25 to commencement of this action (see Bien Decl. ¶ 14(b)); \n26 e.  $766.23 to reimburse Medi-Cal for the lien it has asserted over the \n27 proceeds of any settlement in this action (see Bien Decl. ¶ 14(c)); \n28 f.  $43,789.33 to plaintiff Mary Prasad in compensation for her injuries \n[1145271-4]    4 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE AND FOR \nORDERS TO DEPOSIT MONEY INTO BLOCKED ACCOUNTS \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 140   Filed 04/10/14   Page 6 of 11\n \n1 and loss (see Prasad Decl. ¶ 14; Bien Decl. ¶ 14(d)); and \n2 g.  $394,103.94 collectively to the Minor Plaintiffs in compensation for \n3 their injuries and loss, divided evenly amongst them (for an amount of $131,367.98 each) \n4 (see Bien Decl. ¶ 14(e)). \n5 16.

Best.  See Bien Decl. ¶ 20.  \n13 21.  All the payments set forth herein constitute damages on account of personal, \n14 physical injuries, arising from an occurrence within the meaning of Section 104(a)(2) of \n15 the IRS Code of 1986, as amended.  All sums paid herein constitute damages on account of \n16 personal injuries or sickness arising from injuries that resulted from the allegations made \n17 in the Action, and no portion of the proceeds paid herein represent exemplary or punitive \n18 damages nor pre-judgment or post-judgment interest.  See Bien Decl. ¶ 21.  \n19 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND COMPROMISE OF THE MINORS’ \nCLAIMS IS FAIR, REASONABLE, AND IN THE MINORS’ BEST INTERESTS \n20\n21 22.  The settlement represents an appropriate, fair, and reasonable settlement and \n22 compromise of the Minor Plaintiffs’ claims in this action, and is in their best interests.  See \n23 Shannon A. v. Orland Unified, No. 2:11-cv-00718-TLN-DAD, 2013 WL 4828140, at *2 \n24 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 6, 2013) (citations omitted) (noting court’s “special duty to safeguard the \n25 interests of litigants who are minors” by “conduct[ing] its own inquiry to determine \n26 whether the settlement serves the best interests of the minor”); Robidoux v. Rosengren, 638 \n27 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that court’s duty to safeguard interests of minor \n28 plaintiffs requires a determination whether net amount allocated to each minor plaintiff is \n[1145271-4]    8 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE AND FOR \nORDERS TO DEPOSIT MONEY INTO BLOCKED ACCOUNTS \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 140   Filed 04/10/14   Page 10 of 11\n \n1 fair and reasonable without regard to proportion of settlement for adult co-plaintiffs or \n2 counsel).  Plaintiff and movant Mary Prasad, who as guardian ad litem for the Minor \n3 Plaintiffs has been extensively involved in litigation of this case, has carefully considered \n4 the proposed settlement and determined that it is in the best interests of the Minor \n5 Plaintiffs.  See Prasad Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12.  \n6 23.  It is fair and reasonable to allocate the majority of the settlement shares of \n7 the Minor Plaintiffs to fund structured settlements that will provide payments to them at \n8 age 18 and beyond.  See Prasad Decl. ¶ 15.  It is also fair and reasonable in this particular \n9 case to place a smaller portion of their settlement shares into blocked accounts to cover \n10 major expenses that may arise during their minority, with such funds being accessible only \n11 on further order of the Magistrate Judge of this Court under the procedure authorized by \n12 L.R. 202(f) and set forth in the proposed order filed herewith, with any remaining balance \n13 payable in full to the minor plaintiffs once they reach age 18.  See id.; Bien Decl. ¶ 18; \n14 Confidential Mantoan Decl. ¶ 5. \n15 24.  Under the settlements agreed to by the parties and the compromise proposed \n16 herein, RBGG will receive a share of the total settlement fund, to be paid on account of \n17 Plaintiffs’ claims for statutory attorneys’ fees.  See Bien Decl., Ex. A at 2, Ex. B at 5, Ex. \n18 C at 3.  RBGG will also be reimbursed for costs they have advanced to fund the litigation.  \n19 See Bien Decl. ¶ 12.  The compensation Plaintiffs’ attorneys will receive in fees has been \n20 adjusted downward from the percentage agreed-upon in the retainer agreement, and totals \n21 33% of the total settlement fund recovered.  Plaintiff Mary Prasad, as guardian ad litem for \n22 the Minor Plaintiffs, approves of RBGG’s recovery of the attorneys’ fees and costs set \n23 forth herein based on the representation they provided to all of the plaintiffs in this case, \n24 including the Minor Plaintiffs.  See Prasad Decl. ¶ 16. \n25 25.  Plaintiffs further request issuance of the orders needed to open the blocked \n26 accounts for the benefit of the Minor Plaintiffs described supra.  Filed concurrently with \n27\n28\n[1145271-4]    9 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE AND FOR \nORDERS TO DEPOSIT MONEY INTO BLOCKED ACCOUNTS \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 140   Filed 04/10/14   Page 11 of 11\n \n1 this motion are three proposed orders, one for each of the Minor Plaintiffs, to allow Mary \n2 Prasad to deposit funds into the blocked accounts.3 \n3 26.  Plaintiffs submit that good cause exists to excuse the personal attendance of \n4 the Minor Plaintiffs—the oldest of whom is ten years old—at any hearing that may be held \n5 on this motion, and ask that the Court excuse their attendance pursuant to L.R. 202(d).  See \n6 Prasad Decl. ¶¶ 3-5, 17; Confidential Mantoan Decl. ¶ 6.  Plaintiff Mary Prasad, who has \n7 taken an active role throughout this case, including personally attending numerous \n8 depositions of defendants and the January 20, 2014 mediation with Judge Ramirez, will be \n9 in attendance at the hearing to address any questions the Court may have about the nature \n10 or fairness of the settlement of the Minor Plaintiffs’ claims.  See Prasad Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, 17. \n11  \n12 DATED:  April 10, 2014  Respectfully submitted, \n \n13\nROSEN BIEN GALVAN & GRUNFELD LLP \n \n14\n \n15   By:  /s/ Michael W. Bien \n  Michael W.

In order to open the blocked accounts, however, the depository \n26 institution may require an order setting forth the exact date of birth so that the date of un-\nblocking the accounts can be determined.  For this reason, Plaintiffs will request that their \n27\nProposed Order containing the minors’ full names and dates of birth be filed under seal. \n28\n[1145271-4]    10 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE AND FOR \nORDERS TO DEPOSIT MONEY INTO BLOCKED ACCOUNTS \n ",

Burrell, Jr on 2/22/13.\n(Furstenau, S) (Entered: 02/22/2013)\n04/03/2013 75  MINUTE ORDER: Defendants Cummings, Garbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and\nBhangu's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages concerning\nPlaintiffs' state law claims is pending. (ECF Nos. 61, 73.) Since the parties have not\nbriefed certain issues, counsel shall be prepared to address the following questions\nduring oral argument, which is reset for 9:00 a.m. on April 22, 2013. The hearing\nscheduled for April 8, 2013 is vacated. Further, each party is granted leave to respond\nto the following questions in writing in advance of the hearing by filing a response on\nthe docket at counsel's earliest convenience. Please explain each response. For\nPlaintiffs: 1. In Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109 (1945), the\nSupreme Court states that it is \"immaterial whether [state] statutes... are characterized\neither as 'substantive' or 'procedural.'\" Instead, when deciding whether a state statute\napplies in federal court, what matters is whether the statute \"significantly affect[s] the\nresult of a litigation.\" Id. Does § 425.13 \"significantly affect the result of a litigation?\"\n2.California Civil Procedure Code § 425.13 states that a motion under § 425.13 must\nbe made within two years after filing suit or nine months before the matter is first set\nfor trial, whichever is earlier. Since a federal court deciding state claims \"applies the\nsubstantive law of the state, including the state's statute of limitations,\" Albano v. Shea\nHomes Ltd. P'ship, 634 F.3d 524, 530 (9th Cir. 2011), why is § 425.13's limitations\nperiod inapplicable in federal court? 3. Erie's \"twin aims\" are \"'discouragement of\nforum−shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.'\" Goldberg\nv. Pac. Indem. Co., 627 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir. 2010). Would it encourage forum\nshopping and inequitable administration of the laws to waive § 425.13's requirements\nfor plaintiffs litigating in federal, but not state, court? For Defendants Cummings,\nGarbett, Brown, Young, Weiss, and Bhangu: 1. In College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt, 8 Cal. 4th 704, 718, 717 (1994), the California Supreme Court states that §\n425.13 is a \"procedural protection\" that was not \"intended to change the substantive\nelements of punitive damages claims.\" How does this pronouncement affect your\nargument that § 425.13 is a substantive provision? 2. What state substantive law is §\n425.13 so \"'intimately bound up'\" with so that it is \"an integral component of\nCalifornia's substantive state policy?\" Feldman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 660,\n66667 (9th Cir. 2003). 3. During a § 425.13 hearing, the court cannot \"weigh the\nmerits of the claim or consider its likely outcome at trial.\" Coll. Hosp., Inc., 8 Cal. 4th\nat 719. Does the limited scope of review under § 425.13 make the statute less like a\nsubstantive provision and more like a procedural regulation of the \"manner and the\nmeans by which a [plaintiff may] recover\"? See York, 326 U.S. at 109. Ordered by\nJudge Garland E. Burrell, Jr on 04/03/13.

This case involves the unnecessary and avoidable death of NATHAN \n3 PRASAD, a young man denied basic emergency life-saving treatment for a serious \n4 infection while detained at Sutter County Jail (the “Jail”) on minor, non-violent charges.  \n5 In the course of his approximately one-week detention, NATHAN PRASAD’s condition \n6 deteriorated from an infection wholly treatable through basic and timely medical attention \n7 to an extraordinarily painful death as a result of Sutter County Jail’s failure to provide \n8 treatment.  Sutter County Jail’s failure was despite documented observations of his \n9 emergent medical problems, including coughing up blood, deteriorating vital signs, and \n10 desperate pleas for help by NATHAN PRASAD and other jail inmates. \n11 2.  After reporting to jail staff that he was experiencing enormous pain in his \n12 lower extremities, he was brought to Rideout Memorial Hospital on January 26, 2011 for \n13 further evaluation.  Following diagnostic testing on his lower extremities, hospital staff \n14 discharged NATHAN PRASAD back to the jail after only two-and-a-half hours.  Doctors \n15 provided to jail staff Defendants explicit direction that NATHAN PRASAD be returned to \n16 the emergency room immediately if his symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.  \n17 Hospital staff knew, however, that the jail’s staffing, policies and procedures made such \n18 immediate return extremely unlikely if not impossible.  Because Rideout Memorial \n19 Hospital is the sole facility to which Jail inmates are transported to receive emergency \n20 medical care, hospital staff knew that Jail policies were such that jail medical staff, not \n21 custody staff, were responsible for summoning emergency medical attention, but that jail \n22 medical staff were not present during lengthy periods each day. \n23 3.  Upon his return to Sutter County Jail, NATHAN PRASAD’s symptoms \n24 worsened dramatically, and new alarming symptoms developed.  Jail staff observed and \n25 documented that NATHAN PRASAD was experiencing tremendous pain, coughing up \n26 blood, and telling them that he was afraid he would die without medical care.  Basic \n27 medical diagnostic evaluation at the jail showed that his vital signs indicated extreme \n28 danger.  His pulse rate was abnormally high; he had borderline low blood pressure, and \n[1071448-2]    1 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 3 of 185\n \n1 evinced a precipitous drop in blood pressure since his hospital admission; he had a low \n2 grade fever; and the bruising that had been localized in his lower extremities had travelled \n3 to his midsection.  Fellow inmates desperately sought medical help for NATHAN \n4 PRASAD, going so far as to collect the blood he coughed up in a used milk carton which \n5 was provided to jail staff. \n6 4.  Despite their knowledge, jail staff ignored NATHAN PRASAD’s serious \n7 medical needs, instead ridiculing him and leaving him to continue to deteriorate in his cell \n8 and at the jail. \n9 5.  After almost two days of deterioration and suffering at the jail, NATHAN \n10 PRASAD’s condition became so serious that his blood pressure could no longer be \n11 detected at all and he was losing consciousness.  His condition was so deteriorated by the \n12 time emergency personnel were summoned that subsequent life-saving measures could not \n13 revive him. \n14 6.  NATHAN PRASAD fell into a coma and died on January 28, 2011, at the \n15 age of 30.  He left behind three young children, T.P., A.P., and N.S., with whom he had a \n16 close and loving relationship, and who he helped to support financially and emotionally.  \n17 He further left behind his mother, MARY PRASAD, with whom he remained \n18 exceptionally close throughout his life and in the months prior to his death.  Neither \n19 MARY PRASAD, nor T.P., nor A.P, nor N.S. was able to make it to NATHAN \n20 PRASAD’s bedside to see him before he passed away. \n21 7.  Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to NATHAN PRASAD’s \n22 serious medical needs, and in violation of their duties under federal and state law, causing \n23 NATHAN PRASAD’s tragic and preventable death.  In both 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, \n24 grand juries convened in Sutter County identified widespread deficiencies in training, \n25 staffing, and maintenance of current policies and procedures for the provision of health \n26 care to inmates at Sutter County Jail.  These systemic problems have been known to \n27 Defendants for years, have not been addressed or corrected, and directly and substantially \n28 contributed to NATHAN PRASAD’s death in custody. \n[1071448-2]    2 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 4 of 185\n \n1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2 8.

Defendant DICKSON is being sued in his individual capacity. \n27 34.  Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP was at all times \n28 mentioned herein responsible for the operation of Rideout Memorial Hospital.  Defendant \n[1071448-2]    9 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 11 of 185\n \n1 FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP had and maintained a contractual agreement \n2 with COUNTY OF SUTTER to provide medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, \n3 including ambulance and emergency services.  The process by which Rideout Memorial \n4 Hospital provided treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates involved significant, ongoing \n5 coordination and cooperation between COUNTY OF SUTTER, the Sutter County \n6 Sheriff’s Department, and Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP.  On \n7 information and belief, Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP’s Rideout \n8 Memorial Hospital is the only facility made available to Jail inmates for the delivery of \n9 emergency medical services.  Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP \n10 established and follows a policy, procedure and practice of receiving jail inmates from \n11 Sutter County Jail, and discharging them to Sutter County Jail in a manner that is \n12 deliberately indifferent to the known risk of serious or lethal injury in the event, as in the \n13 case of NATHAN PRASAD, where the discharge instructions depend on a capacity for \n14 emergency medical response that FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP knew did not \n15 exist at Sutter County Jail. \n16 35.

Defendant \n21 FRATERS signed the note discharging NATHAN PRASAD on January 26, 2011, knew of \n22 NATHAN PRASAD’s serious and life-threatening condition and need for access to \n23 emergency medical treatment, and acted with deliberate indifference to the known risk of \n24 serious or lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD given that a safe discharge from the \n25 hospital depended on the capacity for emergency medical response that he knew did not \n26 exist at Sutter County Jail.  Defendant FRATERS is being sued in his individual capacity. \n27 36.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER is a political subdivision of the State of \n28 California, created and existing by virtue of the laws of the State of California.  At all \n[1071448-2]    10 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 12 of 185\n \n1 times relevant to this complaint, Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER employed Defendants \n2 J. PAUL PARKER, DAVID SAMSON, NORMAN BIDWELL, LOU ANNE \n3 CUMMINGS, AMERJIT BHATTAL, BRENT GARBETT, DORIS BROWN, MELODY \n4 YOUNG, KIMBERLY WEISS, GURKIRAT BHANGU, CHRISTINA STOHLMAN, \n5 LESTER EATON, MIGUEL AGUILAR, OLGA TAHARA, ROSA DIAZ, ERIC \n6 CRAWFORD, BALJINDER RAI, and SHANE DICKSON. \n7 37.  Defendants J. PAUL PARKER, DAVID SAMSON, NORMAN BIDWELL, \n8 LOU ANNE CUMMINGS, AMERJIT BHATTAL, BRENT GARBETT, DORIS \n9 BROWN, MELODY YOUNG, KIMBERLY WEISS, GURKIRAT BHANGU, \n10 CHRISTINA STOHLMAN, LESTER EATON, MIGUEL AGUILAR, OLGA TAHARA, \n11 ROSA DIAZ, ERIC CRAWFORD, BALJINDER RAI, SHANE DICKSON, , \n12 FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP, and MICHAEL FRATERS, and each of them, \n13 to the extent they engaged in any acts or omissions alleged herein, engaged in such acts or \n14 omissions under color of state law. \n15 38.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times \n16 mentioned in this complaint, Defendants, and each of them, were the agents, employees, \n17 servants, joint venturers, partners and/or co-conspirators of the other Defendants named in \n18 this complaint and that at all times, each of the Defendants was acting within the course \n19 and scope of said relationship with Defendants. \n20 EXHAUSTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES \n21 39.  Plaintiffs MARY PRASAD, T.P., and A.P. filed state governmental tort \n22 claims with the State and Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER, including on behalf of the \n23 ESTATE of NATHAN PRASAD, on July 21, 2011.  By correspondence dated \n24 September 7, 2011, their governmental tort claims were rejected.  By way of stipulation, \n25 Plaintiff N.S. was excused by Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER from compliance with \n26 the governmental tort claims requirement. \n27\n28\n[1071448-2]    11 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 13 of 185\n \n1 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2 Nathan Prasad’s Life and the Circumstances of His Detention in Sutter County Jail \n3 40.  NATHAN PRASAD was born on April 10, 1980 in Cedarville, California. \n4 41.  NATHAN PRASAD had a close relationship with his family, helping to \n5 raise his young children and assisting his mother and grandmother with various daily and \n6 household tasks.  Despite a history of mental illness, NATHAN PRASAD had made great \n7 strides in the time before his death towards becoming independent and self-sufficient.  \n8 After several years struggling with mental illness, he had moved into his own apartment \n9 for the first time in his life and was working towards gainful employment.  He spent most \n10 days with his family, including his elderly grandmother, his mother and step-father, and his \n11 children. \n12 42.  COUNTY OF SUTTER officials and employees – including individual \n13 Defendants, county mental health staff, county law enforcement, and county jail staff – had \n14 extensive contact with NATHAN PRASAD.  NATHAN PRASAD had been involuntarily \n15 hospitalized to receive emergency mental health treatment pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n16 Code § 5150, and had been placed in the custody of the Sutter County Sheriff’s \n17 Department multiple times, generally during periods in which he was manifesting serious \n18 mental illness and in light of alleged non-violent parole and probation violations.  \n19 COUNTY OF SUTTER produced and maintained significant documentation of his mental \n20 health and medical needs.  This documentation was included in his Sutter County Jail \n21 inmate records, and, upon information and belief, reviewed by Defendants CUMMINGS, \n22 BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, \n23 DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON. \n24 43.  COUNTY OF SUTTER officials and employees were further aware of a \n25 long-standing and trenchant problem with contagious bacterial infections at Sutter County \n26 Jail.  Said officials and employees were further aware that NATHAN PRASAD had \n27 suffered from an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection (Staphylococcus aureus, or staph) \n28 during a prior period of custody at the Jail in January 2010, and been treated for that \n[1071448-2]    12 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 14 of 185\n \n1 infection by jail medical staff.  Jail medical staff further documented at that time that \n2 NATHAN PRASAD had experienced “[r]ecurrent MRSA [Methicillin-resistant \n3 Staphylococcus aureus] infections” (emphasis added).  Documentation regarding \n4 NATHAN PRASAD’s prior treatment was included in his Sutter County Jail inmate \n5 records, and, upon information and belief, reviewed by Defendants CUMMINGS, \n6 BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, \n7 DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON. \n8 44.  NATHAN PRASAD was arrested on or about January 21, 2011, based on \n9 non-violent misdemeanor and parole-related charges.  He was taken to Sutter County Jail, \n10 where he was detained for the next week.  During that time period, NATHAN PRASAD \n11 developed a medical condition which, as a result of the denial of plainly necessary \n12 treatment to address a developing infection, led to great suffering and his painful death on \n13 January 28, 2011. \n14 45.  At the time of NATHAN PRASAD’s death, T.P. was seven (7) years old, \n15 A.P. was six (6) years old, and N.S was three (3) years old.  NATHAN PRASAD died just \n16 two (2) days before A.P.’s seventh birthday. \n17 Medical Problems, Pain, and Suffering While Detained in Sutter County Jail \n18 46.  Soon after NATHAN PRASAD was booked into Sutter County Jail on \n19 January 21, 2011, NATHAN PRASAD reported to jail staff that he was experiencing \n20 significant pain in his lower extremities.  He was further manifesting symptoms of mental \n21 illness.  Jail staff, including Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, \n22 STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and \n23 DICKSON observed NATHAN PRASAD on multiple occasions experiencing pain, \n24 swelling, and other serious medical symptoms, and jail staff including Defendants \n25 BROWN, WEISS, and YOUNG documented these symptoms. \n26 47.  While detained at Sutter County Jail in January 2011, NATHAN PRASAD \n27 completed and submitted to jail staff at least one written request to receive medical \n28 treatment.  He reported that he was suffering “extreme pain” and stated that he required \n[1071448-2]    13 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 15 of 185\n \n1 “emergency” medical attention. \n2 48.  After several days of reported and documented medical concerns, Defendant \n3 BROWN evaluated NATHAN PRASAD and, following consultation with Defendant \n4 CUMMINGS, referred NATHAN PRASAD to Rideout Memorial Hospital for what was a \n5 brief medical evaluation. \n6 49.  Upon information and belief, Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, \n7 CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT fail to maintain a medical records system that \n8 appropriately documents and transmits critical medical information about Jail inmates to \n9 affiliated health care providers – a defect which renders a prison health care system \n10 constitutionally inadequate.  See Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1314 (E.D. Cal. \n11 1995) (holding that correctional facilities “have a constitutional obligation to provide \n12 inmates with adequate medical care” and that “[a] necessary component of minimally \n13 adequate medical care is maintenance of complete and accurate medical records”); Adams \n14 v. Tilton, Case No. 1:07-cv-00791-GSA PC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88009, at *29 (E.D. \n15 Cal. Sept. 9, 2009) (citations omitted) (holding that “[a]dequate and accurate medical \n16 records are essential to a prison’s providing inmates with continuity of medical care,” and \n17 that the Constitution “is violated when incomplete and inaccurate medical records create a \n18 ‘the possibility for disaster’ arising from a lack of necessary information about an inmate’s \n19 medical history”).  As a result, and upon information and belief, information regarding \n20 NATHAN PRASAD’s clinically significant history of recurrent MRSA (Methicillin-\n21 resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infections was not provided or made available to \n22 Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP or Defendant FRATERS.  Had this \n23 information been provided to Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP and/or \n24 Defendant FRATERS on January 26, it could have signaled the need for a simple blood \n25 test that would have identified NATHAN PRASAD’s advancing infection and enabled \n26 prompt, life-saving antibiotic treatment. \n27 50.  NATHAN PRASAD was evaluated and treated at Rideout Memorial \n28 Hospital on January 26, 2011, as pursuant with the Hospital’s agreement to treat Sutter \n[1071448-2]    14 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 16 of 185\n \n1 County Jail inmates.  A short time after his arrival at the Emergency Department, \n2 emergency room physician Defendant FRATERS discharged NATHAN PRASAD with \n3 specific discharge instructions that if his symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, he \n4 was to be returned to the Emergency Department immediately.  At the time, Defendant \n5 FRATERS knew, based on the information available to him, that NATHAN PRASAD was \n6 exhibiting signs of a serious and life-threatening condition – a condition which would \n7 result in his death less than 55 hours later.  Defendant FRATERS further knew that \n8 NATHAN PRASAD would need access to emergency medical treatment if his symptoms \n9 worsened or new symptoms developed.  NATHAN PRASAD was discharged on the \n10 afternoon of January 26, and returned to Sutter County Jail. \n11 51.  Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP’s Rideout Memorial \n12 Hospital staff, acting pursuant to a contract with COUNTY OF SUTTER to provide \n13 medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, acted with deliberate indifference by \n14 discharging NATHAN PRASAD to a notoriously dangerous setting at Sutter County Jail.  \n15 Hospital staff knew that NATHAN PRASAD would not possibly receive the observation, \n16 supervision, and ongoing access to emergency medical treatment he would likely need \n17 given his serious medical complaints and condition. \n18 52.  Defendant FRATERS acted with deliberate indifference to the known risk of \n19 serious or lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD given that his safe discharge from the \n20 hospital depended on timely access to emergency medical response, which he knew did not \n21 exist at Sutter County Jail, a setting that is notoriously dangerous for individuals with \n22 serious medical needs and that does not provide sufficient around-the-clock access to \n23 medical care.  Neither Defendant FRATERS nor any other employee or agent of \n24 FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP conducted any follow-up regarding NATHAN \n25 PRASAD after he was discharged, including any follow-up to ensure that discharge \n26 instructions directing that NATHAN PRASAD be returned to the emergency department \n27 immediately if any new symptoms developed were understood by recipients. \n28 53.  On information and belief, Defendant BIDWELL, as the officer charged with \n[1071448-2]    15 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 17 of 185\n \n1 managing day-to-day operations at the Jail, was informed and aware of NATHAN \n2 PRASAD’s evaluation at Rideout Memorial Hospital and the discharge instructions \n3 providing that if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed, he must be taken to \n4 the emergency room immediately. \n5 54.  On information and belief, Defendants CUMMINGS, BROWN, YOUNG, \n6 WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, \n7 CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON each reviewed and/or were aware of NATHAN \n8 PRASAD’s custody file and/or medical file, including the medical documentation \n9 indicating his medical status and need to be taken to the emergency room immediately if \n10 his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, \n11 WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, \n12 CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON reviewed and/or were aware of NATHAN PRASAD’s \n13 custody file and/or medical file because each of them was on duty at the Jail during \n14 NATHAN PRASAD’s January 2011 detention and had significant contact with NATHAN \n15 PRASAD after his return from the hospital (as documented in paragraphs 56-74, infra).  \n16 Defendant CUMMINGS reviewed and/or was aware of NATHAN PRASAD’s custody \n17 and/or medical file because she is required, as medical director of the county jail medical \n18 facility, to review and approve all examination and treatment records initiated by \n19 practitioners.  Moreover, Defendant BROWN consulted with Defendant CUMMINGS \n20 regarding NATHAN PRASAD’s symptomology and treatment plan. \n21 55.  Throughout NATHAN PRASAD’s detention at Sutter County Jail, \n22 Defendants CUMMINGS, GARBETT, BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, \n23 STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and \n24 DICKSON failed to provide sufficient medical screening, evaluation, and observation of \n25 his medical condition and emergent treatment needs. \n26 Defendants’ Failure to Provide Clearly Necessary Life-Saving Emergency Treatment \n27 56.  Shortly upon his return from the brief hospital admission, it became readily \n28 apparent that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were in fact getting \n[1071448-2]    16 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 18 of 185\n \n1 significantly worse.  His symptoms included shortness of breath, severe chills, and extreme \n2 pain.  NATHAN PRASAD began coughing and/or vomiting up blood.  On the evening of \n3 January 26, 2011, Defendant WEISS documented that NATHAN PRASAD was suffering \n4 from “uncontrollable pain” and spoke with Defendant BROWN.  Yet no follow-up \n5 evaluation was provided that night, nor was NATHAN PRASAD returned to the \n6 Emergency Department for treatment as his discharge note required. \n7 57.  From January 26 to January 28, NATHAN PRASAD stated aloud repeatedly \n8 that he was in extreme pain and having trouble breathing.  He reported to staff that he \n9 thought he was going to die unless he received immediate medical attention.  He was \n10 manifesting numerous symptoms indicating a serious and life-threatening condition and an \n11 immediate need for emergency medical treatment. \n12 58.  Several fellow inmates observed NATHAN PRASAD’s worsening condition \n13 and notified staff at the jail, including Defendants YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, \n14 AGUILAR, RAI, and DICKSON.  One or more jail staff members responded that \n15 NATHAN PRASAD was faking his pain and other symptoms and that he and the other \n16 inmates needed to “get over it.” \n17 59.  Fellow inmates collected the blood that NATHAN PRASAD was coughing \n18 up in an empty milk carton, and, upon information and belief, showed it to Defendants \n19 YOUNG and RAI in an effort to obtain emergency medical help for NATHAN PRASAD. \n20 60.  Jail staff, including Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, \n21 STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and \n22 DICKSON observed NATHAN PRASAD’s suffering and heard his and his fellow \n23 inmates’ pleas for immediate medical help.  Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, and WEISS \n24 documented NATHAN PRASAD’s complaints and worsening symptoms.  In spite of the \n25 alarming reports and the observations of Defendants, they failed to provide adequate \n26 evaluation or timely emergency treatment for a period of 36 hours or more. \n27 61.  Defendant BROWN observed NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and \n28 reviewed the Emergency Department records and discharge instructions to return him to \n[1071448-2]    17 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 19 of 185\n \n1 the hospital immediately if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  She \n2 observed and documented that he was continuing to experience pain and other serious, and \n3 worsening, symptoms, but took no steps to obtain the emergency medical care he \n4 obviously needed.  Specifically, Defendant BROWN observed NATHAN PRASAD at \n5 9:00 a.m. on January 27, 2011 and documented alarming symptoms including an \n6 abnormally high pulse rate, precipitous drop in blood pressure, low grade fever, marked \n7 dehydration, and increased bruising across NATHAN PRASAD’s midsection.  His vital \n8 signs had changed dramatically and dangerously from the readings taken during his \n9 January 26 hospitalization and those taken during Defendant BROWN’s own evaluation \n10 immediately prior to that hospitalization.  NATHAN PRASAD’s presentation on the \n11 morning of January 27, 2011 clearly and obviously alerted Defendant BROWN to \n12 NATHAN PRASAD’s rapidly worsening condition and need for immediate emergency \n13 treatment.  Nonetheless, Defendant BROWN did nothing other than prescribe an additional \n14 pain reliever.  Defendant BROWN took no steps to ensure that NATHAN PRASAD \n15 received any type of medical monitoring in light of his rapidly worsening vital signs, \n16 notwithstanding that such monitoring was immediately called for and essential to saving \n17 NATHAN PRASAD’s life.  No follow-up medical observation or evaluation of any kind \n18 was documented at any future time on January 27, 2011.  Indeed, none was documented \n19 until nearly twenty (20) hours later. \n20 62.  Defendant BHANGU conducted the evening medication pass on January 27, \n21 2011.  At that time NATHAN PRASAD’s serious illness, intense distress and need for \n22 immediate emergency medical care were obvious.  Defendant BHANGU did not document \n23 or provide any treatment or evaluation of his dire condition, nor did she make any effort to \n24 secure the emergency care that NATHAN PRASAD obviously required. \n25 63.  While conducting a safety check of the cell where NATHAN PRASAD was \n26 detained, Defendant AGUILAR witnessed NATHAN PRASAD’s dire condition and was \n27 told by NATHAN PRASAD and other inmates that NATHAN PRASAD required \n28 immediate medical attention.  Defendant AGUILAR did not make any effort to summon \n[1071448-2]    18 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 20 of 185\n \n1 medical care or otherwise address NATHAN PRASAD’s urgent medical needs. \n2 64.  Defendant DICKSON, after observing NATHAN PRASAD screaming in \n3 pain and begging to be taken to the hospital for treatment, ridiculed NATHAN PRASAD.  \n4 Defendant DICKSON stated that NATHAN PRASAD was the type of person who comes \n5 to jail because he wants to get free medical care.  Defendant DICKSON ignored NATHAN \n6 PRASAD’s serious medical condition, and took no steps to address his medical needs. \n7 65.  In the pre-dawn hours of January 28, 2011, Defendants RAI and YOUNG \n8 observed, and Defendant YOUNG documented, that NATHAN PRASAD’s blood pressure \n9 and blood-oxygen saturation were dangerously low, that he was coughing and/or vomiting \n10 up blood, dizzy, sweating, cold, and clammy.  On information and belief, he reported to \n11 Defendants RAI and YOUNG that he felt like he was “going to die.” \n12 66.  After the many hours and days during which NATHAN PRASAD was \n13 exhibiting worsening symptoms and significant suffering and was pleading with jail staff \n14 for help, Defendants RAI and YOUNG placed NATHAN PRASAD in a Sutter County Jail \n15 office early on January 28.  However, they provided him no medical treatment, and failed \n16 to properly monitor his deteriorating condition, for a period of nearly four (4) hours.  \n17 Defendants RAI and YOUNG did not call an ambulance or make other arrangements for \n18 NATHAN PRASAD to be taken to the hospital emergency room for emergency and life-\n19 saving medical care. \n20 67.  Instead, NATHAN PRASAD was made to sit in a jail office room, without \n21 medical attention of any kind, even as his condition got worse, including further coughing \n22 up of blood and deteriorating vital signs.  Defendant GARBETT was informed of \n23 NATHAN PRASAD’s critical condition but did nothing to summon desperately needed \n24 emergency care. \n25 68.  Defendants DIAZ and TAHARA observed NATHAN PRASAD during the \n26 hours he was locked in the jail office on the morning of January 28, 2011.  Defendants \n27 DIAZ and TAHARA heard NATHAN PRASAD plead for help and tell Defendant \n28 YOUNG repeatedly that he felt like he was “going to die.”  Defendants DIAZ and \n[1071448-2]    19 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 21 of 185\n \n1 TAHARA heard Defendant YOUNG tell NATHAN PRASAD that she would do nothing \n2 for him.  Defendants DIAZ, TAHARA and YOUNG then locked NATHAN PRASAD \n3 back in the jail office without providing or summoning any medical care. \n4 69.  Defendant CRAWFORD heard NATHAN PRASAD kicking the locked door \n5 to the jail office, repeatedly and desperately yelling “I can’t breathe!  I can’t breathe!”  \n6 Defendant CRAWFORD ordered NATHAN PRASAD to stop yelling and to lie down.  \n7 Defendant CRAWFORD did not report these observations to anyone, or make any effort to \n8 summon medical care or attention of any kind. \n9 70.  Defendant EATON was the officer in charge from the evening of January 27, \n10 2011 until 6:00 a.m. on January 28, 2011.  During this time period, Defendant EATON \n11 became aware that NATHAN PRASAD had been complaining about difficulty breathing – \n12 a serious and life-threatening condition – for at least several hours, extending back to the \n13 pre-dawn hours when no nursing or medical staff were on site. \n14 71.  Defendant STOHLMAN assumed duties as officer in charge at or about 6:00 \n15 a.m. on January 28, 2011.  At or around the time of this shift change, Defendant EATON \n16 informed Defendant STOHLMAN that NATHAN PRASAD had been complaining about \n17 difficulty breathing – a serious and life-threatening condition – for at least several hours.  \n18 Defendant EATON further informed Defendant STOHLMAN that NATHAN PRASAD \n19 had been placed in a jail office, and that Defendant YOUNG had told NATHAN PRASAD \n20 that she could not do anything for him and thus was not providing any treatment or care to \n21 NATHAN PRASAD. \n22 72.  Despite this knowledge, neither Defendant EATON nor Defendant \n23 STOHLMAN at any time made any efforts to summon critically needed emergency \n24 medical care, and they each tacitly endorsed the inaction and indifference of the officers \n25 under their supervision. \n26 73.  Not until nearly four hours later on January 28 was an ambulance \n27 summoned.  By that time, NATHAN PRASAD’s condition had deteriorated dramatically \n28 and his skin had turned blue due to severe oxygen deficiency and cyanosis.  His blood \n[1071448-2]    20 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 22 of 185\n \n1 pressure could no longer be detected.  NATHAN PRASAD was at this point suffering \n2 from severe sepsis. \n3 74.  The failure of correctional officer Defendants STOHLMAN, EATON, \n4 AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON to contact emergency \n5 medical services was consistent with an established practice in effect at Sutter County Jail \n6 such that medical staff were responsible for determining who goes to the hospital or calling \n7 for an ambulance in an emergency situation, despite the lack of 24-hour medical staff \n8 availability at the jail.  Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, and BIDWELL created, were \n9 aware of, and enforced this policy, knowing that it would endanger inmates like NATHAN \n10 PRASAD who require emergency medical attention. \n11 NATHAN PRASAD’s Painful and Preventable Death \n12 75.  NATHAN PRASAD suffered severe bronchopneumonia and multiple organ \n13 failure as a result of Defendants’ failure to provide timely medical treatment.  This \n14 excruciating condition resulted from a bacterial infection that had spread systemically – an \n15 infection which could have been treated with a course of antibiotics, had Defendants \n16 GARBETT, BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, \n17 TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON timely responded to NATHAN \n18 PRASAD’s obvious suffering.  By the time NATHAN PRASAD reached the hospital on \n19 January 28, however, he was deemed to be in critical condition and was unconscious, \n20 leading to his placement in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Rideout Memorial Hospital. \n21 76.  None of the Defendants timely contacted NATHAN PRASAD’s family.  As \n22 a result, his mother MARY PRASAD, his children T.P., A.P., and N.S., and other family \n23 members were unable to make it to the hospital in time to see NATHAN PRASAD while \n24 he was still alive. \n25 77.  Meanwhile, Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL and STOHLMAN \n26 took steps to drop all pending charges and to release NATHAN PRASAD “on his own \n27 recognizance” after he was placed in the ICU and was in critical condition.  Defendant \n28 STOHLMAN personally signed paperwork effecting NATHAN PRASAD’s “own \n[1071448-2]    21 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 23 of 185\n \n1 recognizance” release, collected NATHAN PRASAD’s belongings from the Jail and \n2 transported them to Rideout Memorial Hospital as NATHAN PRASAD lay dying, in an \n3 effort to distance the Jail from its responsibility for NATHAN PRASAD and his dire \n4 condition. \n5 78.  At approximately 4:19 pm on January 28, NATHAN PRASAD was \n6 pronounced dead by hospital staff. \n7 79.  Had NATHAN PRASAD not been placed in a jail setting known to be \n8 dangerous and ill-equipped to ensure timely emergency medical treatment, and had such \n9 emergency treatment been summoned and provided to NATHAN PRASAD, his condition \n10 could have been effectively treated.  He would not have experienced severe pain and \n11 suffering, and his life would have been saved. \n12 Longstanding and Systemic Deficiencies in Sutter County Jail’s Provision of \nEmergency Treatment to Inmates, Medical Staffing, and Policies and Procedures in \n13 Violation of Existing Court Order \n14 80.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER has knowingly maintained and tolerated \n15 longstanding and systemic deficiencies in Sutter County Jail’s provision of emergency \n16 treatment to seriously ill inmates.  It has also knowingly had inadequate medical staffing as \n17 well as policies and procedures that were likely in violation of an existing court order \n18 directing minimum standards of medical treatment at the jail.  Defendants PARKER, \n19 SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT were aware of and \n20 tolerated these serious deficiencies in Sutter County Jail’s medical care system, policies, \n21 and procedures. \n22 81.  Upon information and belief, Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, \n23 CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT fail to maintain a medical records system that \n24 appropriately documents and transmits critical medical information about Jail inmates to \n25 affiliated health care providers, including emergency care provider FREMONT-RIDEOUT \n26 HEALTH GROUP and the physicians who work there.  This defect renders the health care \n27 system at Sutter County Jail constitutionally infirm. \n28 82.  Upon information and belief, Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and \n[1071448-2]    22 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 24 of 185\n \n1 GARBETT authorized and implemented a policy pursuant to which medical staff was only \n2 available at the Jail from 4:00 a.m. to midnight.  This policy meant that, for crucial hours \n3 each day, there was no medical staff whatsoever available to respond to, triage or treat \n4 emergency situations.  Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT have \n5 persisted in this policy notwithstanding that the 2007-2008 Sutter County Grand Jury made \n6 a specific recommendation that a nurse be on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven days a \n7 week at Sutter County Jail. \n8 83.  Upon information and belief, Defendants PARKER, SAMSON and \n9 BIDWELL authorized and implemented a policy such that jail medical staff, not custody \n10 staff, were responsible for summoning emergency medical attention when Jail inmates \n11 required such attention.  Defendants PARKER, SAMSON and BIDWELL persisted in this \n12 policy notwithstanding that they knew that there were hours each day in which there was \n13 no medical staff whatsoever available to respond to, triage or treat emergency situations. \n14 84.  As identified by a Sutter County Grand Jury in its 2010-2011 Final Report, \n15 Sutter County Jail has had several further known deficiencies in its system of providing \n16 treatment to inmates.  (The Final Report of the 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury is \n17 appended as Attachment A.) \n18 85.  Identified deficiencies included inadequate medical staffing, non-compliant \n19 medical policies and procedures, and a medical program that was long out-of-compliance.  \n20 The 2010-2011 Grand Jury noted that such deficiencies were “unacceptable,” and may \n21 have caused Sutter County to be in violation of an existing court order in Haller v. Sutter \n22 County, Case No. CIV-S-93-1256, which mandates certain jail conditions, policies, and \n23 procedures for providing medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates. \n24 86.  The 2010-2011 Grand Jury found that medical staffing at Sutter County Jail \n25 has been inadequate, and that the hiring of additional staff is required. \n26 87.  The 2010-2011 Grand Jury noted a report that training of staff had not \n27 occurred in more than five (5) years as of 2011, and that such training was “necessary to \n28 maintain proficiency in emergency response procedures” (emphasis added).  The Grand \n[1071448-2]    23 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 25 of 185\n \n1 Jury found that Sutter County Jail had failed to offer staff required training pursuant to \n2 court order and the jail’s own Medical Policies and Procedures. \n3 88.  The 2010-2011 Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s health care \n4 policies and procedures were significantly out of date, and that conditions at the jail had \n5 been allowed to “deteriorate.” \n6 89.  The 2010-2011 Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s nursing program \n7 was “completely out of compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard \n8 nursing procedures,” and found “unacceptable that the program is out of compliance, [the] \n9 lack of training for the nursing staff, [and] not having the [policies and procedures] up-to-\n10 date,” among other problems. \n11 90.  The 2010-2011 Grand Jury, pursuant to its statutory authority, identified \n12 Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT as responsible for responding to \n13 these findings and recommendations regarding the Jail’s dangerous and deficient medical \n14 care system.  On information and belief, Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and \n15 GARBETT have not responded. \n16 91.  In 2011-2012, a second Sutter County Grand Jury investigated improper \n17 denial of medical care at Sutter County Jail, in particular the denial of care to an inmate \n18 who was arrested on January 21, 2011 and whose health while in custody severely and \n19 rapidly deteriorated leading to his January 28, 2011 death.  On information and belief, the \n20 inmate whose death was the focus of this investigation was NATHAN PRASAD. (The \n21 Final Report of the 2011-2012 Sutter County Grand Jury Pursuant to Penal Code 933(a) on \n22 subject – Sutter County Jail Death is appended as Attachment B.) \n23 92.  The 2011-2012 Grand Jury noted that at 8:00 a.m. on January 28, 2011 “[t]he \n24 JNM [Jail Nurse Manager] arrived and was briefed by the LVN [Licensed Vocational \n25 Nurse] on the inmates’ [sic] condition and he did not review the medical chart or examine \n26 the inmate.”  As noted in the report, this JNM is Defendant GARBETT. \n27 93.  The 2011-2012 Grand Jury further noted that “[t]here was never any formal \n28 discussion or meeting held for jail nursing staff to review the inmate’s case,” and that “in \n[1071448-2]    24 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 26 of 185\n \n1 fact the HO [Health Officer] did not allow any discussion among medical staff about the \n2 inmate’s case.”  As noted in the report, the HO is Defendant CUMMINGS. \n3 94.  At the outset of its report, the 2011-2012 Grand Jury noted its “concern[ ]” \n4 that “past inadequate staff training and incomplete JMS [Jail Medical Services] policies \n5 and procedures could have been contributing factors in the inmate’s death.”  The 2011-\n6 2012 Grand Jury further noted that the “Sutter County Sick Bay Policy #56” in place as of \n7 January 28, 2011 was nearly ten years old, “was one page and stated in general terms that \n8 only medical staff could place inmates with medical problems in Sick Bay,” and “did not \n9 offer any [further] guidance.” \n10 95.  In its formal statement of findings, the 2011-2012 Grand Jury found that \n11 (inter alia): “[t]he JNM did not take any interest or immediate action responding to the \n12 inmate’s medical emergency which is inconsistent with RN training and not in compliance \n13 with the job description to provide professional nursing care”; “the AD violated the \n14 conditions of the job description by enabling the JNM to be negligent of duties and \n15 responsibilities throughout the JNM’s entire tenure,” including “continuous \n16 noncompliance by not reviewing and updating [policies and procedures] annually (Title 15 \n17 sec. 1206 CA code), no in-clinic training program to assure standardized treatment \n18 procedures, and reluctance to act in the capacity of an RN”; “[t]here is no in-house training \n19 provided to JMS staff that is specific to their job”; and “[a]ll JMS Management (JNM, AD, \n20 and HO) abrogated their responsibility by not conducting a [morbidity and mortality] \n21 conference following the death of the inmate.”  As noted in the report, the JNM is \n22 Defendant GARBETT, the AD is Defendant BHATTAL, and the HO is Defendant \n23 CUMMINGS. \n24 96.  The 2011-2012 Grand Jury further found that, even in light of the preceding \n25 year’s Grand Jury Report recommending prompt revision of policies and procedures for \n26 medical care at Sutter County Jail, as of April 9, 2012 “only about half of the [policies and \n27 procedures] [had] been finalized and made available on the intranet,” and that “[t]here was \n28 no priority after the inmate death to immediately implement a policy that included vital \n[1071448-2]    25 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 27 of 185\n \n1 sign parameters indicating when to call for an ambulance.” \n2 97.  The systemic deficiencies regarding the provision of emergency and other \n3 medical treatment at Sutter County Jail, as well as the inadequate staffing, policies, and \n4 procedures, as identified in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 Grand Jury Reports and in \n5 violation of the existing Haller v. Sutter County court order, directly caused the woefully \n6 inadequate emergency medical attention and treatment that NATHAN PRASAD received \n7 between January 26 and January 28, 2011, leading to his untimely and preventable death \n8 on January 28, 2011. \n9 98.  Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, \n10 CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, and GARBETT maintained inadequate medical staffing and \n11 insufficient policies and procedures.  These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, \n12 insufficient direction as to what circumstances require emergency medical care and the \n13 procedure for summoning emergency medical care.  Moreover, Defendants COUNTY OF \n14 SUTTER, GARBETT, BHATTAL, and CUMMINGS provided no in-house training at all \n15 to jail medical staff, including no training whatsoever on the provision of emergency \n16 medical care to Sutter County Jail inmates with serious and/or life-threatening medical \n17 conditions, even though this training was necessary to maintain minimally adequate \n18 emergency response procedures.  Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, GARBETT, \n19 BHATTAL, and CUMMINGS, by their acts and omissions, tolerated known dangers and \n20 risks of serious harm to inmates, like NATHAN PRASAD, who required emergency care \n21 while in the Jail.  These failures directly caused the denial of emergency medical attention \n22 and treatment that NATHAN PRASAD required between January 26 and January 28, \n23 2011, leading to his untimely and preventable death on January 28, 2011. \n24 99.  Sutter County Jail has recently experienced several likely preventable inmate \n25 deaths in custody, indicating a culture of deliberate indifference to inmates’ serious \n26 treatment needs at the Jail.  In addition to NATHAN PRASAD’s death, there have been \n27 disturbing reports of inmate deaths in April 2010 and September 2011. \n28\n[1071448-2]    26 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 28 of 185\n \n1 NATHAN PRASAD’s Mother and Young Children Have Been Profoundly Harmed \nby Defendants’ Misconduct Leading to NATHAN PRASAD’s Death \n2  \n3 100.

As NATHAN PRASAD’s mother, MARY PRASAD has experienced the \n7 painful loss of her eldest son.  She has been denied the regular contact that she and \n8 NATHAN PRASAD had.  She has lost the loving mother-son relationship that she and \n9 NATHAN PRASAD maintained, including regular contact, a warm relationship, and the \n10 assistance that NATHAN PRASAD regularly provided her, including home maintenance \n11 and improvement projects. \n12 102.  As NATHAN PRASAD’s young children, T.P., A.P., and N.S. have \n13 experienced the traumatic loss of their father, who remained close to them throughout their \n14 lives until his tragic death.  They have taken the loss of their father extremely hard, asking \n15 when they will be able to see him again.  They have had and will continue to have great \n16 difficulty coping with his death during their most formative years.  T.P., A.P., and N.S. \n17 have further suffered the loss of NATHAN PRASAD’s financial support, his care and \n18 supervision of them, and his paternal guidance. \n19 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n20 to the Constitution of the United States – Deliberate Indifference to Serious \nMedical Needs, Health and Safety \n21 (Survival Action – 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Against Defendants J.

Based on NATHAN PRASAD’s previous contact with COUNTY OF \n5 SUTTER and Sutter County Jail officers and employees, including all individual \n6 Defendants, Defendants had substantial documentation of his medical needs, and his need \n7 for consistent supervision and prompt medical attention when warranted. \n8 b.  NATHAN PRASAD’s Sutter County Jail inmate records documented \n9 that he had a history of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infections, \n10 and had required treatment for such an infection during a prior period of custody at Sutter \n11 County Jail.  Documentation regarding this prior history was included in his Sutter County \n12 Jail inmate records, and, upon information and belief, reviewed by Defendants \n13 CUMMINGS, BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, \n14 AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON. \n15 c.  NATHAN PRASAD completed and submitted at least one written \n16 request to receive medical treatment, reporting “extreme pain” and the need for \n17 “emergency” medical attention. \n18 d.  Emergency room physicians documented clear instructions that were \n19 placed in NATHAN PRASAD’s jail custody file and/or medical file, that if his symptoms \n20 worsened or new symptoms developed, he needed to be returned to the hospital for \n21 emergency treatment immediately.  Upon information and belief, Defendant BIDWELL, \n22 as the officer charged with managing day-to-day operations at the Jail, was informed and \n23 aware of NATHAN PRASAD’s evaluation at Rideout Memorial Hospital and the \n24 discharge instructions providing that if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms \n25 developed, he must be taken to the Emergency Department immediately.  Upon \n26 information and belief, Defendants CUMMINGS, BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, \n27 BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, \n28 and DICKSON each reviewed and/or were informed of NATHAN PRASAD’s jail custody \n[1071448-2]    28 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 30 of 185\n \n1 file and/or medical file, including the medical documentation indicating his medical status \n2 and need to be taken to the emergency room immediately if his symptoms worsened or \n3 new symptoms developed. \n4 e.  Defendants FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP and \n5 FRATERS, who treated NATHAN PRASAD pursuant to a COUNTY OF SUTTER \n6 contractual agreement to provide medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, \n7 discharged NATHAN PRASAD to a notoriously dangerous setting at Sutter County Jail on \n8 January 26, 2011.  They knew that NATHAN PRASAD was exhibiting signs of a serious \n9 and life-threatening condition and would need access to emergency medical treatment if \n10 his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  Defendants further acted with \n11 deliberate indifference to the known risk of serious or lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD \n12 given that his safe discharge from the hospital depended on the capacity for timely \n13 emergency medical response which they knew did not exist at Sutter County Jail, given the \n14 hospital’s service agreement and their experience treating Sutter County Jail inmates. \n15 f.  From January 26 to January 28, 2011, NATHAN PRASAD reported \n16 to each of Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, AGUILAR, TAHARA, \n17 DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON that he was in extreme pain, having trouble \n18 breathing, and afraid that he was going to die. \n19 g.  Defendants BROWN, WEISS and YOUNG each observed and \n20 documented that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were clearly getting \n21 worse, including but not limited to vomiting, shortness of breath, severe chills, coughing \n22 and/or vomiting up blood, and “uncontrollable pain.” \n23 h.  On January 27, 2011 – the morning following NATHAN PRASAD’s \n24 initial trip to Rideout Memorial Hospital – Defendant BROWN documented NATHAN \n25 PRASAD’s alarming and clearly worsening symptoms including an abnormally high pulse \n26 rate, precipitous drop in blood pressure, low grade fever, marked dehydration, and \n27 increased bruising; \n28 i.  Defendants BHANGU, AGUILAR, DICKSON and RAI and each \n[1071448-2]    29 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 31 of 185\n \n1 observed that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were clearly getting worse \n2 and heard his and his fellow inmates’ pleas for medical help. \n3 j.  Inmates housed with NATHAN PRASAD collected the blood that \n4 NATHAN PRASAD was coughing up in an empty milk carton, showing it to Defendants \n5 BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, and DICKSON, in a desperate effort to obtain medical attention \n6 and treatment for him. \n7 k.  In the pre-dawn hours of January 28, 2011, Defendants RAI and \n8 YOUNG observed, and Defendant YOUNG documented, NATHAN PRASAD’s \n9 significant suffering and life-threatening symptoms, including dangerously low blood \n10 pressure and blood-oxygen saturation, coughing and/or vomiting up blood, dizziness, \n11 sweats, and reports that NATHAN PRASAD feared that he was “going to die.”  Defendant \n12 GARBETT was informed of these alarming symptoms but did nothing whatsoever in \n13 response.  Defendants STOHLMAN, EATON, TAHARA, DIAZ and CRAWFORD each \n14 witnessed and/or were informed of NATHAN PRASAD’s severe distress and need for \n15 immediate medical care, yet did nothing to secure that care despite knowing that \n16 Defendant YOUNG was providing no treatment whatsoever. \n17 l.  Not until four (4) hours after these observations and documented \n18 reports did Sutter County Jail staff contact emergency medical services and summon an \n19 ambulance.  By the time emergency personnel arrived, NATHAN PRASAD’s condition \n20 had deteriorated so substantially that his condition was dire.  He died soon thereafter at the \n21 hospital. \n22 m.  Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT fail to \n23 maintain a medical records system that appropriately documents and transmits critical \n24 medical information about Jail inmates to affiliated health care providers, knowing that \n25 such failure will prevent critically ill inmates like NATHAN PRASAD from receiving \n26 appropriate treatment. \n27 n.  Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, \n28 BHATTAL, and GARBETT developed, implemented and endorsed deficient emergency \n[1071448-2]    30 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 32 of 185\n \n1 response policies and procedures, and exhibited a persistent failure to train staff regarding \n2 the provision of emergency medical care, knowing that these acts and omissions \n3 endangered critically ill inmates such as NATHAN PRASAD. \n4 105.  Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, \n5 GARBETT, BROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, \n6 TAHARA, DIAZ, CRAWFORD, RAI, DICKSON, FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH \n7 GROUP and FRATERS disregarded these known risks by failing to provide necessary \n8 evaluation and treatment for NATHAN PRASAD while he was detained at Sutter County \n9 Jail. \n10 106.  Defendants’ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n11 limited to their failure to provide NATHAN PRASAD with timely or adequate medical \n12 care and/or to take other measures to protect him from serious harm, along with the acts \n13 and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to train, supervise and/or promulgate \n14 appropriate policies and procedures at Sutter County Jail in order to prevent NATHAN \n15 PRASAD’s and other inmate deaths, constituted deliberate indifference to NATHAN \n16 PRASAD’s serious medical needs, health and safety. \n17 107.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, NATHAN \n18 PRASAD experienced physical pain, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of his \n19 life, and NATHAN PRASAD and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages as alleged \n20 herein. \n21 108.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants PARKER, \n22 SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, GARBETT, BROWN, YOUNG, \n23 WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, AGUILAR, TAHARA, DIAZ, \n24 CRAWFORD, RAI, DICKSON, FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP, and \n25 FRATERS were malicious, reckless and/or accomplished with a conscious disregard of \n26 decedent’s rights thereby entitling Plaintiffs to an award of exemplary and punitive \n27 damages according to proof, to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter \n28 such conduct in the future. \n[1071448-2]    31 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 33 of 185\n \n1 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nMunicipal Liability for Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution \n2 of the United States – Deliberate Indifference to Serious \nMedical Needs, Health and Safety \n3 (Survival Action - 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Against Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER) \n4\n109.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 108 of \n5\nthis complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n6\n110.  Defendants PARKER, SAMSON and BIDWELL are charged with \n7\ndeveloping and implementing policies and procedures for the Corrections Unit of the \n8\nSutter County Sheriff’s Department.  The policies, customs and practices that they ratify \n9\nand implement pursuant to this authority are thus imputable to COUNTY OF SUTTER. \n10\n111.  Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT are charged with \n11\ndeveloping and implementing policies and procedures for the provision of medical services \n12\nat Sutter County Jail.  The policies, customs and practices that they ratify and implement \n13\npursuant to this authority are thus imputable to COUNTY OF SUTTER. \n14\n112.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being \n15\ndeliberately indifferent to NATHAN PRASAD’s serious medical needs, health and safety \n16\nand violating NATHAN PRASAD’s civil rights were the direct and proximate result of \n17\ncustoms, practices and policies of Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, by and through \n18\ntheir agencies, employees and/or agents, including Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, \n19\nBIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT, as alleged herein. \n20\n113.  Such policies, customs and/or practices include but are not limited to an \n21\nongoing pattern of deliberate indifference, including the following: the failure to maintain \n22\na medical records system that appropriately documents and transmits critical medical \n23\ninformation about Jail inmates to affiliated health care providers; the failure to ensure \n24\nimplementation of appropriate medical and emergency treatment plans; the failure to act \n25\nupon clearly life-threatening symptoms and reports; the failure to provide appropriate \n26\nstaffing and training at Sutter County Jail to provide minimally adequate medical treatment \n27\nfor seriously ill inmates; and the failure to implement a policy to ensure that staff would \n28\n[1071448-2]    32 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 34 of 185\n \n1 contact and summon emergency medical treatment in a timely manner. \n2 114.  Such policies, customs and/or practices have persisted even in the face of a \n3 grand jury report finding “unacceptable that the program is out of compliance, [the] lack of \n4 training for the nursing staff, [and] not having the [policies and procedures] up-to-date.”  \n5 Even NATHAN PRASAD’s horrific death in custody did not yield any prompt revision of \n6 policies and procedures to ensure that basic emergency care was provided to Jail inmates.  \n7 The continuation of such policies, customs and/or practices in the face of repeated findings \n8 that they are dangerous evinces deliberate indifference of the part of COUNTY OF \n9 SUTTER and its policymakers PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, \n10 BHATTAL and GARBETT to the woefully inadequate and unconstitutional level of \n11 medical care at the Jail. \n12 115.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER and its policymakers PARKER, \n13 SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL and GARBETT tacitly encouraged, \n14 ratified and/or approved of the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, and knew that such \n15 conduct was unjustified and would result in violations of constitutional rights. \n16 116.  The customs, policies and/or practices of Defendants COUNTY OF \n17 SUTTER were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ injuries and the death of the \n18 NATHAN PRASAD in that Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER failed to adequately train \n19 and supervise its employees and/or agents to prevent the occurrence of the constitutional \n20 violations suffered by Plaintiffs and NATHAN PRASAD, and by other inmates at Sutter \n21 County Jail.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER also failed to promulgate appropriate \n22 policies or procedures or take other measures to prevent the constitutional violations \n23 suffered by Plaintiffs and NATHAN PRASAD, and by other inmates at Sutter County Jail. \n24 117.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned customs, policies \n25 and/or practices of Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER, NATHAN PRASAD and Plaintiffs \n26 suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n27\n28\n[1071448-2]    33 \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 2:12-CV-00592-TLN-CKD \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 35 of 185\n \n1 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nSupervisory Liability for Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution \n2 of the United States – Deliberate Indifference to Serious \nMedical Needs, Health and Safety \n3 (Survival Action - 42 U.S.C. § 1983)  \n(Against Defendants J.

Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL acted in their \n10\nsupervisory capacity in committing the acts alleged herein. \n11\n120.  Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, and GARBETT were responsible for \n12\nsupervising all medical and mental health employees and/or agents responsible for \n13\nproviding care to inmates at the Jail.  Defendants CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, and \n14\nGARBETT acted in their supervisory capacity in committing the acts alleged herein. \n15\n121.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants GARBETT, \n16\nBROWN, YOUNG, WEISS, BHANGU, STOHLMAN, EATON, TAHARA, DIAZ, \n17\nCRAWFORD, RAI, and DICKSON in being deliberately indifferent to NATHAN \n18\nPRASAD’s serious medical needs, health and safety and violating decedent’s civil rights \n19\nwere the direct and proximate result of customs, practices and policies of Defendants \n20\nPARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, CUMMINGS, BHATTAL, and GARBETT as alleged \n21\nherein. \n22\n122.

The customs, policies and/or practices of said Defendants were a direct and \n9 proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ injuries and the death of the NATHAN PRASAD in that \n10 Defendants failed to adequately train and supervise their employees and/or agents to \n11 prevent the occurrence of the constitutional violations suffered by Plaintiffs and NATHAN \n12 PRASAD, and by other inmates at Sutter County Jail.  Defendants also failed to \n13 promulgate appropriate policies or procedures or take other measures to prevent the \n14 constitutional violations suffered by Plaintiffs and NATHAN PRASAD, and by other \n15 inmates at Sutter County Jail. \n16 125.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned customs, policies \n17 and/or practices of Defendants, NATHAN PRASAD and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and \n18 damages as alleged herein. \n19 126.

We were privileged to be selected a year ago to serve on \nthe Sutter County Grand Jury as “a voice of the people and conscience of the \ncommunity.” We took our work seriously and did our best to approach our reviews and \ninvestigations objectively and thoroughly.  \nIt has been a year of learning and hard work in gaining new insights; some were \nfrustrations, and some were fun. We have all had personal growth in this Grand Jury \nexperience. As is with any new Grand Jury, eighteen independent individuals with \ndistinctive talents and skills successfully formed cohesive efforts to make their \ncontribution to the citizens of this county. Members of this Jury have dedicated countless \nhours of work investigating, compiling, debating, and writing these reports. Each member \nof this Grand Jury contributed greatly to this report. I am proud of my fellow jurors and \nall they have accomplished. \nThis year was Judge Brian Aronson second year as the supervising judge for the Grand \nJury. We would like to thank Judge Aronson, together we have learned a lot. To complete \nour work, we had the assistance of the county's court staff, particularly Christine Dagnino \nand Jackie Laswell. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Our \nthanks to District Attorney Carl Adams and his staff who assisted us along the way taking \nour phone calls and providing us with the information we needed to perform our duties as \nmembers of the Grand Jury. We commend District Attorney Carl Adams dedication of \ntime as the legal advisor for the Grand Jury for the past twenty-eight years. The Court \nSecurity Staff was very helpful as we navigated unfamiliar territory around the \ncourthouse. Many individuals from the various agencies we visited were also helpful in \ncountless ways. \nIn Conclusion I would like to thank this year’s Grand Jurors for their conscientious effort \nand commitment. I would also like to thank Tammie Putman for her dedication and \nservice as the Pro-tem and Secretary of the 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury. Her \ndedication has made our job much easier. In closing, I would also like to express my \n  2 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 46 of 185\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 47 of 185\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 48 of 185\nTable of Contents \n                    Page \nAD-HOC Committee                 7 \nSutter County Jail Nurses Program Citizens Complaint       8 \n  Attachment A               12   \nAudit and Finance Committee             13 \n   \nMisallocation of Bradley-Burns and Transportation Tax Fund Deposits  14   \n    Attachment A               19 \n    Attachment B               20 \n    Attachment C               21 \nCounty Government and Administration Committee      22\n     \nCounty Government Release of Public Information        23 \nCriminal Justice Committee              26 \n                     \nLeo Chesney Community Correctional Facility        27 \nSutter County Jail                29 \nSutter County Department of Child Support Services      31 \nYuba City Police Department             34 \n   \nYuba-Sutter Juvenile Hall Camp Singer Youth Guidance Center    35 \n   \nEducation Committee                38 \n   \nSutter County Superintendent of Schools          39 \nSutter Union High School               43 \n   \nFire and Emergency Committee            45 \n  Office of Emergency Management             46 \nTwin Cities Rod and Gun Club            48 \n  5 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 49 of 185\nHealth and Mental Health Services Committee        50 \n   \nSutter-Yuba Mental Health Services           51 \n   \nPlanning and Environment Committee          54 \n   \nSutter County Environmental Health Division        55 \nSutter County Planning Services            57\nPublic Buildings and Properties Committee         58 \nSutter County Animal Control Shelter          59 \nSocial Services Committee              78 \nMaternal, Child and Adolescent Health Program        79\nSutter County Department of Human Services         81 \nContinuity Committee                84 \n   \nDepartment of Child Support Services          85 \nLeo Chesney Community Correctional Facility        86 \nSutter County Jail                 87 \nYuba City Police Department             88 \nYuba-Sutter Juvenile Hall              89 \n  6 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 50 of 185\nAD-HOC \nCommittee \n  7 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 51 of 185\nSutter County Jail Nurses Program \nCitizens Complaint \nIntroduction \nThe 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury (SCGJ) received a citizen's complaint on the \nSutter County Jail Nurses Program. The complaint alleged illegal practices, lack of \ntraining, out of compliant policies/procedures and poor inmate medical care. \nThe Grand Jury established an Adhoc Committee to undertake an investigation to \ndetermine these allegations on the complaint. Interviews were held with supervisors, \nmanagers, and staff of the Sutter County Jail. The Adhoc Committee completed an \ninvestigation of this complaint and made a number of recommendations resulting from \nthat investigation. \nDiscussion \nThe Sutter County Jail Nurses program is to ensure provision of emergency and basic \nhealth care services to individuals who are in custody. Nursing Staff provides health care \nto the incarcerated from booking until the time of release. Along with the Physician and \nNurse Practitioner, there is a Jail Nurse Manager, a Supervising Registered Nurse (SRN) , \nthree Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN)'s  and 7-8 contract LVN's. Since November \n2010, the county has an open position for a second SRN. \nThe Grand Jury felt the allegations in the complaint were serious and needed to be \ninvestigated. \nThe complaint alleges the following: \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nAccording to the complaint, per Legal Decree #CIV- S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P) of \nDempsey W. Haller, et al. vs. The County of Sutter, et al. (see attachment, A) states in \npart: \nE. 2. Staffing:  \"Jail medical staffing is the responsibility of the County's Human \nServices Department and shall consist of at least one registered nurse on site during either \nthe day shift or the evening shift seven days per week, and either one registered nurse or \none L VN on site during the other day shift or evening shift as appropriate, seven days per \nweek ... \" \nPrior to the resignation of a SRN, there was one SRN and LV  N on the day shift or one \nSRN and LV  N on the night shift. There was an incident when the SRN on the night shift \nbecame ill while on duty. The SRN called in a LV  N for backup. The SRN was \nreprimanded by the Jail Nurse Manager in an email that there should have been a \nRegistered Nurse on duty. The SRN was referred to legal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DFL \n8 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 52 of 185\nJFM (P) against Sutter County, which states the requirement. The SRN was not told of \nthis legal decree prior to this incident. According to the staff, there had been 20 days so \nfar that year that this had occurred. During the investigation, it was noted that this was a \ncommon occurrence since there were only two SRNs. \nLack of Training \nAccording to the complaint training of staff nurses has not occurred in more than five (5) \nyears. Annual onsite training is necessary to maintain proficiency in emergency response \nprocedures. \nBefore the SRN resigned, the SRN requested onsite training. The SRN's request was \nrefused by the Jail Nurse Manager. The SRN put together training on Emergency \nResponse in the jail. The SRN asked for a review ofthe materials and the Jail Nurse \nManager refused to even look at the class outline. The SRN held the class with a few \nnurses and correctional staff in attendance. \nOut of Compliant Policies and Procedures \nThe complaint alleged the Jail Nurses Program is out of compliance with California State \ncorrectional code - Title 15 sec 1206 Policy and Procedures (P&P) are to be reviewed \nannually. Standardized Nursing Procedures (SNP) have not been reviewed or updated \nsince 1995. The SNP has been changed with pencil marks. \nThe nursing staff has inquired as to why these P&P's and the SNP's are outdated. The \nJail Nursing Manager's answer is lack oftime prevents him from completing the task. \nFinding \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nThe Nurse staffing at the Jail has been directed by a court order in Dempsey W. Haller \nvs. Sutter County, et al. No. CIV -S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P). Failure to comply with this \norder Sutter County can be found out-of-compliance and could be liable for additional \naction by the Court. \nRecommendation \nEvery effort should be made to hire an additional SRN and ensure one is available for \neither the AM shift or the PM shift. The Nursing Program Manager needs to take a more \nactive role in managing the Jail Nursing Program. Once the SRN position is filled, the \nNursing Program Manager, who is also an RN, must be utilized to ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram is in compliance with the court order. \n9 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 53 of 185\nThe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should provide oversight to insure \nthe Jail Nursing Program is in full compliance with court order Legal decree #CIV -S-93-\n1256 DLF JFM (P). \nFinding \nLack of Training \nLegal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DLF JFM (P) \nE 19. Training: \"Jail custody staff shall receive periodic update training in First Aid, CPR, \nintake screening, blood borne pathogens and suicide prevention ... \" \nSutter County Jail Medical Policies and Procedures #3 Section 6. \"Oversees training of \nnurses and/or officers in areas where improvement is needed, as identified by QA audits, \nincluding regular and continued joint staff development activities. These will be \ndocumented as to date given, content, attendees and comments.\" \nTraining is necessary to maintain proficiency in on-site activities. The Nursing Program \nManager has failed to offer his nursing staff any of the required training. When one of his \nSRN's put together an emergency response training class he refused to review the course \noutline before the class was held. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends the Nursing Program Manager along with the Medical \nOfficer, develop a training program to ensure adequate on-site training be made available \nto the nursing staff on a regular basis. The Assistant Director of Health and Human \nServices should provide oversight to ensure this training program is implemented. \nFinding \nOut of Compliance Policies and Procedures \nTitle 15 Regulations 1206. Health Care Procedure Manual \"The health authority shall in \ncooperation with the facility administrator, set forth in writing, policies and procedures in \nconformance with applicable State and Federal law, which are reviewed and updated at \nleast annually ... \" \nDuring the investigation, it was stated unanimously that the P&P's were significantly out \nof-date. The County Medical Officer is responsible for making sure the P&P's are current \nby signing them annually. The Jail Nurse Program Manager has overall responsibility to \nsee that the Nursing Program policies and procedures are operational and functioning in \nthe scope as laid out in the Standard Nursing Procedures. The Jail Nurse Program \nManager has not done this. When the Jail Nurse Program Manager was hired, the P&P's \nwere not up to date. By not correcting these problems, his inaction has allowed this \n10 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 54 of 185\nsituation to deteriorate further. The Jail Nurse Program Manager indicated it would take \nover a year to complete. This should be made a priority. \nRecommendation \nThe County Medical Officer and the Jail Nurse Program Manager with oversight from \nthe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram P&P's are reviewed, rewritten, and made current so they can be used and \nreferred to by the jail staff. The Standard Nursing Procedures has been changed with \npencil marks and needs to be corrected. \nThe Grand Jury recommends that these documents be completed by December 31, 2011. \nThe Jail Nursing Program would also benefit from more active oversight by the Assistant \nDirector of Health and Human Services to see that it is accomplished by the above date. \nFinding \nDuring this investigation the Grand Jury finds the Jail Nursing Program is completely out \nof compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard nursing procedures. This \nexposes Sutter County to numerous potential issues in the future. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends that the Assistant Director of Health and Human Services \nactively take measures to ensure that this program is in full compliance with the law. It is \nunacceptable that the program is out of compliance, lack of training for the nursing staff, \nnot having the P & P's up-to-date, and the pencil corrections in the SNP. The Grand Jury \nrecommends that the Jail Nursing Program be in full compliance by December 31, 2011. \nRespondents \nDirector of Health and Human Services, Tom Sherry \nAssistant Director of Health and Human Services, Amerjit Bhattal \nCounty Medical Officer, Dr. Cummings \nJail Nurse Program Manager, Brent Garbett \n11 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 55 of 185\nAttachment A \n12 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 56 of 185\n-\n- ..... \n\\  '_.

The \ncare  an \nSCGJ  conducted  an  investigalion  into  the  inmate's  time  in  custody  and  specifically  the  quality  of \nmedical  treatment he  received  while  at  the jail. \nThe  SCGJ  conducted  interviews  of all  Jail  Medical  Services  (JMS)  personnel  in  (cid:127)nanagement \npositions, jail  clinic  staff members,  Rideout  Hospital  Emergency  Room  (ER)  physicians,  the \nambulance  emergency medical  team  (EMT)  personnel,  and  family  members  of the  deceased. \nThe  SCGJ  found  the medical  treatment  of the  inmate, just  prior to  his  tinal  transport to  Ridcout \nHospital  ER,  to  have  been  below  the  standard  of care.  This  can  indirectly  be traced  to  a  myriad \nof problems  with  the jail  clinic  program. \nRecommendations  fi'om  lbe  SCGJ  are to  make  changes  at the jail  medical  clinic  to  improve \noversight  and  supervision.  Responsibility  should  be taken  by  those  in  management  positions  to \ncomplete  and  maintain  policies and  procedures,  provide  training  to  nurses,  and  conduct \nMorbidity and  Mortality  (M&M)  discussions  in  order to  prevent  recurrence  of adverse  outcomes. \nBACKGROUND \n]\"he  Sutter  County JMS  provides necessary  e(cid:127)nergency  and  basic  health  care  services  to \nindividuals  who  in  custody  from  booking  until  time of release.  Medical  Staff is  comprised  of \nare \nthe  Health  Officer (HO),  Jail  Nurse  Manager (JNM),  Nurse  Practitioner (NP),  two  (2t \nSupervising  Registered  Nurses  (RN),  fi)ur (4)  15censed  Vocational  Nurses  (I.VN),  and  on-call \nLVN's  needed. \nas \nA  sick  call  request  form  must be  filled  out  if an  inmate  wants  to  be  seen  at  the jail  medical  clinic. \nThese  tbrms  are collected  by a JMS  staff member during  medication  pass,  then  reviewed  and \ntriaged  by  an  RN  for  follow-up.  In  a  medical  emergency,  the  nurse on  duty,  either  using  his/her \nown judgment  or  by  consulting  with  a  physician,  NP  or  RN,  can  determine  if an  inmate  needs  to \nbe  seen  at  Rideout  Hospital  ER. \nManagement \nAs  part of the  invesligation,  the  SCGJ  reviewed job  descriptions  of those  in  authority  at  the jail \nclinic  to  ascertain  their  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  (see  Appendix  A).  This  included  the \nJNM,  the  HO,  and  Assistant  Director of Human  Services-I tealth  Division  fAD). \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 75 of 185\nHealth  O]ficer \nl\"he  HO  is  a  physician  who  acts as  medical  director of the  Sutter County jail  and  is  responsible \nfor oversight of the  quality  of health  care provided  to  inmates  and  making  final  decisions  on  all \nclinical  matters.  ]'he  HO  is  responsible  tbr the  development and  annual  review  of medical \npolicies  and  procedures,  including  nursing  assessment prolocols.  Even  though  the  ltO  reports \ndirectly to the  Board  of Supervisors,  this  position  coordinates  with  the  AD  in  support  of the  JMS. \nThe  current  HO  has  been  in  the  position  since  2010. \nAssistant Director of Human Services-Health  Division \nAccording  to  the job  description,  the  AD  \"'...has  the  primary  authority  and  responsibility  for \ndirecting  for  functional  of services  within  the  Human  Services  Department...\"  including \na  area \njail  health  services.  Having  oversight  ofthejail  clinic,  the  AD  is  responsible  for  its  efficient \noperation  and  delivery  of quality  medical  care  in  a timely  manner.  The  AD  directly  supervises \nthe JNM.  The  current  AD  has  been  in  this  position  since 2007. \nJail Nurse Manager \nAccording to  the job  description,  the  JNM  has  the  responsibility  \"...to  plan,  organize,  coordinate \nand  manage jail  medical  services;  to  supervise  nursing  staff:  to  oversee  quality  assurance  and \nlegal  compliance  issues;  and  to  perform  related  work  as  required.\"  This  includes  development  of \n\"'...policies,  procedures  and  standards  to  ensure  quality  of care\",  directing  staff in  the  delivery  of \nhealth  services  to  inmates,  responding  to  emergency  inmate  care,  and  providing  \"...professional \nnursing  care  as  needed.\"  The JNM  is  also  responsible  for \"...handling  employee  concerns  and \nproblems\"  and  \"...directing  employee  training  and  development\".  The  current JNM  has  been \nin  this  position  since  2009. \nPolicies  and Procedures \nThe  2010-2011  SCGJ  wrote  a report  addressing  a  complaint  of the  Sutter County  Jail  Nurses \nProgram  which  alleged,  among other things,  out  of compliant  policies/procedures.  The  complaint \nalleged  the Jail  Nurses  Program  was  out of compliance  with  the  California  State  correctional \ncode  Title  15  see  1206,  which  states that  Policy  and  Procedures  (P&P)  are  to  be  reviewed  and \nupdated  annually.  Also,  Standardized  Nursing  Procedures  had  not  been  reviewed  or  updated \nsince  1995  and  had  been  changed  with  pencil  marks.  The  2010-201  SCGJ  recommended  that \n\"The  County  Medical  Officer and  the  Jail  Nurse  Program  Manager  with  ovcrsight  fi-om  the \nAssistant  Director  of Health  and  Human  Services  should  ensure that  Jail  Nursing  Program  P&P's \nare  revie(cid:127)ved,  rewritten,  and  made  current  so  they  can  be  used  and  referred  to  by  the jail  staff.\" \nThis  was  lo  be  completed  by  December  31,201  I. \nNurse  Training \nThe  2010-2011  SCGJ  also  addressed.a  complaint  of lack  of staff training at  the  Sutter County \nJail  and  recommended  the JNM,  along  with  the  HO,  \"...develop  a  training  program  to  ensure \nadequate  on-site  training  be  made  available  to  the  nursing  staffon  a  regular basis\".  ]'he  AD \n\"...should  provide  oversight  to  ensure  this  training  program  is  implemented.\" \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 76 of 185\nComplaint \nBased  on  the  serious  nature  of the  complaint,  the  SCGJ  agreed  to  investigate  the  allegation  of an \ninmate  not  receiving proper medical  care  during his eight  days  of incarceration.  Furthermore, \nthere  seemed  to  be a  lack  of urgency  by  JMS  management  to  implement changes  in  order to \navoid  a  similar adverse  outcome.  The  SCGJ  was  concerned  past  inadequate  stafftraining  and \nincomplete JMS  policies  and  procedures  could  have  been  contributing  factors  in  the  inmate's \ndeath. \nAPPROACH \nInterviews  were  conducted  with  the  Director of Human  Services,  Assistant  Director of  luman \nServices-Health  Division,  the  Health  Officer,  the  Jail  Nurse  Manager,  several jail  nursing  staff \nmembers,  Rideout  Hospital  ER  physicians,  the  ambulance  EMT  personnel,  several  correctional \nofficers,  and  fhmily  members  of the  deceased. \nMedical  and jail  records and  reports associated  with  the case  were  obtained  and  studied.  Copies \nof treatment  protocols  and  the  updated  Policies  and  Procedures  were  requested.  Several  SCGJ \nmembers  participated  in  a tour of the  Surfer County  Jail,  including the jail  clinic,  the  Medical \nCell  (formerly  Sick  Bay),  and  the  office  of the JNM. \nDISCUSSION \nThe  inmate  had  been  complaining  of pain  in  his  leg/foot  since  sometime after his  arrest  on \nJanuary  21,201  I.  On  January  24,  2011,  he  requested  sick call,  and  was  seen  at the jail  clinic  on \nJanuary 25,  201  I.  The  inmate  was  scheduled  for  sick  call  again  on  January  26,  2011,  because  of \nincreasing  leg  pain.  The jail  nurse  on  duty  requested  he  be transported  to  Rideout  Hospital  ER. \nAfter evaluation  and  negative  findings  by  ER  physicians,  he  was  returned  to  the.jail.  Since  the \ninmate  continued  to  complain  of leg  pain that  night,  he  was prescribed  medication  and  seen  again \nat the jail  clinic  on  Thursday  morning,.  January 27,  2011.  During  late  evening  Thursday/early \nFriday  morning  his condition  severely  and  rapidly deteriorated.  He  was  escorted  by \nCorrectional  Officer on  duty  to  the  nurses'  station  on  January  28,  2011,  at  4:39  AM.  Abnormal \nvital  signs  and  appearance,  together with  reporting  of coughing  up  blood,  indicated  the  inmate  to \nbe  in  serious  distress.  His  vitals  were:  Blood  Pressure (BP)  64/44,  Pulse  (P)  120,  Respirations \n(R)  24,  Temperature (T)  97.6  and  Oxygen  Saturation  93. \nThe  LVN  on  duty  lhiled  to  recognize the  urgency  of the  medical  situation  to  seek  immediate \nhelp.  The  LVN  did  not consult with  the  on  call  physician  or call  tbr an  ambulance.  At  5:25 \nAM,  the  LVN  made  the  determination  to  place  the  inmate  in  the  Medical  Cell,  located  across \nfrom  the jail  clinic,  requesting  30 minute  visual  checks  by  custody  officers. \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 77 of 185\nAt  8:00  AM,  the  inmate  was  brought  back  to  the  clinic  and  his  vital  signs  were  retaken  by  the \nLVN:  BP  unobtainable,  P  142,  R  40  with  significant  shortness  of breath,  and  T  94.2.  'l'hc JNM \narrived  and  was  briefed  by  the  LVN  on  the  inmates'  condition  and  he did  not  review  the  medical \nchart or examine the  inmate.  The NP  arrived  at  8:05  AM  and  noted  very,  loud  respirations  from \nthe  inmate.  Vital  signs  were taken,  and  the  NP  immediately  requested  an  ambulance  to  transport \nhim  to  Rideout  Hospital.  His  condition  further deteriorated  and  the  inmate  died  in  the  ICIJ  later \nthat  ai(cid:127)ernoon. \nAccording  to  several  Rideout  Hospital  physicians,  it  is  unknown  and  probably  unlikely  that  an \nearlier transporl  to the  hospital  would  have  changed  this outcome.  However,  this  does  not \nabsolve the actions  of the  nurse  on  duty.  who  failed  to  recognize  the  emergency  and  confined  the \nseriously  ill  inmate  in  the  Medical  Cell  tbr over three  hours  while  she  attended  to  other  routine \nduties. \nThere  was  never any  formal  discussion  or  meeting  held  for the jail  nursing  staff to  review the \ninmate's  case.  Morbidity  and  Mortality  conferences  are  considered  to  be  invaluable  learning \ntools  with  the  goal  to  discuss and  gain  insight  when  there  is  an  unexpected  death  or  poor \noutcome.  As  the  medical  director  of JMS,  the  ttO  is  the  most  likely  person  to  moderate  these \nM&M's.  However,  it was  discovered  that  M&M-like  discussions  were  not  held  and  in  fact  the \nHO  did  not  allow  any  discussion  among  mcdical  staff about the  inmatc's  case. \nThe  P&P's  were  not  current  at  the  time  the  JNM  was  hired  tbur  years  ago  and  no  progress  was \nmade  until  the  2010-2011  SCGJ  made  its  recommendations  for them  to  be  updated.  It  has  been \nan  ongoing  process  for  both  the  ItO  and  JNM  to  (cid:127)Tite  and  implement  them.  Approximately  half \nof the  P&P's  are  completed  except  tbr  most  of the  nursing  assessment  protocols  which  arc \npending  HO  approval. \nOn  the  day  the  inmate  was placed  in  the  Medical  Cell,  the  Sutter County  Sick  Bay  Policy  #56, \ndated  October  8,  2001,  was  in  place.  It was  one  page  and  stated  in  general  terms  that  only jail \nmedical  staffcouid  place  inmates with  medical  problems  in  Sick  Bay;  it  did  not offer any \nguidance.  According  to the  October  12,  2011,  revised  JMS  Policy  #16-501,  only  the  JNM,  RN \nSupervisor or NP  can  determine  if an  inmate  meets  the  criteria  to  be  placed  in  the  Medical  Cell. \nIt  is  not to  be  used  tbr an  inmate  with  an  unstable condition  that  requires  frequent  observation. \nAn  LVN  must  have  verbal  orders to  move an  inmate  into  the  Medical  Cell. \nAlmost  one  year after the  inmate's  death,  a  priority  still  had  not  been  made to  write  a  protocol  to \nhelp  guide  nursing  staff should  an  inmate  present  with  similar  vital  signs  and  symptoms.  There \nseemed  to  be  no  urgency  in  developing  P&P's  to  ensure  inmates  receive  critical  medical \nattention  in  timely  Finally,  Vital  Sigms  Monitoring  JMS  Policy  # 16-506,  dated \na  manner. \nJanuary  9,  2012,  includes  parameters  for normal  and  abnormal  vital  signs and  required  actions. \nThe  need  to  consult  with  a  NP  or physician  in  case of any  concerns  or questions  regarding \ninmate  health  is  stressed  numerous  times  in  the  policy. \nThe  JNM  has  provided  the  SCGJ  with  documentation  of mandatory  training  for the  JMS \ncompleted  last  year,  including CPR,  blood  borne  pathogens,  H1PAA,  and jail  (cid:127)fety.  However, \nhe  has  not  provided  documentation  of any  in-house  training  related  to  direct  patient  care or  staff \nmeeting  minutes  showing  patient  care  discussions  or training. \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 78 of 185\nThroughout  all  of the  interviews  conducted  by  the  SCGJ,  not one  JMS  staff member  felt that  the \nJNM  provides  efl'ectivc  leadership nor  are  they  confident  about  consulting  him  regarding  patient \ncare.  When  asked,  several  of their responses  about  the  JNM's  participation  in  the  clinic \nindicated  he's  either  never there  or always  in  his  office,  which  is  located  around  thc  corner  from \nthe  clinic. \nSutter County  Health  Department  requested  the  National  Commission  on  Correctional  ttealth \nCare  (NCCHC)  to  assess  and  propose  solutions  to  improve  its  health  care  management  and  costs. \nThis  organization  is  the  leader  in  setting  standards  for correctional  tiacilities.  A  facility  can \nrequest an  assessment  by  NCCHC  for the  purpose  of reviewing  and  comparing their  health  care \nservices  against  national  standards.  In  November 201  I,  NCCHC  conducted  on-site  review  of \nan \nthe JMS  (see  Appendix  B). \nThe  chief finding  of NCCHC  for the  JMS  their  \"...policies,  procedures,  and  guidelines  have \nwas \nnot  been  vetted,  nor has  stati'been  trained.  Although  training  is  planned,  the  lack  of strategic \nplanning,  developed  policies  and  procedures  and  consistent  leadership  in  the  application  of those \npolicies  and  procedures  have  greatly  hampered  the  delivery  of health  services  at the  Sutter \nCounty Jail.\"  In  addition,  \"...there  has  been  no  effective  process  that  studies the  quality of \nhealth  care  provided  in  the jail.  A  registered  nurse  reviews  charts,  but  the  data  from  these \nreviews  is  limited  to  documentation  issues  and  does  not  evaluate  the  clinical  care.  The  chart \nreviews  include  no  information  regarding  the  quality  of care  provided.\" \nAlthough  the NCCHC  commended  the jail  medical  staff efforts  to  provide  health  care  with  their \nlimited  resources,  they  made  several  recommendations  to  improve  the quality of care.  The \nNCCHC  recommendalions  include: \ncompleting the  policies  and  procedure  manual \nimplementing  \"...nursing  protocols  possible  and  that  nm(cid:127)ing  staff'is \n(cid:127),  as  soon  as  ensure \nproperly  trained\" \n•  improvement  on  the  health  record  fomaat  and  contents  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  the \nquality  of health  delivery \ncare \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 79 of 185\nFINDINGS \nFI.  The  involved  LVN,  by  fhiling  to  recognize  the  medical  emergency  and  by  not  calling  Ibr \nambulance,  acted  inadequately  in  the  treatment of the  inmate. \nan \nF2.  The  JNM  did  not  take  any  interest  or  immediate  action  responding to  the  inmate's \nmedical  emergency  which  is  inconsistent  with  RN  training  mad  not  in  compliance  with \nthe job  description  Io  provide  professional  nursing  care. \nF3.  Although  the  2010-2011  SCGJ  recommended  a  December  31,2011  completion date, \nonly  about  half of the  P&P's  have  been  finalized  and  made  available  on  the  intranet. \nThere  was  no  priority  after the  inmate  death  to  immediately  implement  a  policy  that \nincluded  vital  sign  parameters  indicating when  to  call  fbr an  ambulance. \nF4.  According to  the job  description,  the  AD  has  direct  involvement  with JMS,  not  only  for \noversight  of the JNM's  performance,  but  for the  purpose  of recognizing  and  improving \nemployee  problems.  With  the  discontent  amongst  the  JMS  staffwith  the JNM,  the  AD  is \nnot  attune  to  the  problems  at the jail  medical  clinic  and/or not taking  appropriate,  decisive \nsteps  to  resolve  them. \nFS.  The  AD  violated  the  conditions  of the job  description  by  enabling the  JNM  to  be \nnegligent  of duties  and  responsibilities  throughout  the  JNM's  entire  tenure.  This  includzs \ncontinuous  noncompliance  by  not reviewing  and  updating  P&P's  annually  (Title  15  sec \n1206  CA  code),  no  in-clinic  training  program  to  assure  standardized  treatment \nprocedures,  -and  reluctance  to  act  in  the  capacits'  of an  RN. \nThere  is  in-house  training  provided  to  JMS  staffthat  is  specific  to  their job. \nno \nAll  JMS  Management  (JNM,  AD,  and  HO)  abrogated  their responsibility  by  not \nconducting  M&M-like  conference  following the  death  of the  inmate. \nan \nFS.  M&M-like  conferences  have  not  been  held  after adverse  incidents  at  the  JMS  clinic. \nThese  discussions  have  been  discouraged  by  the  tt0.  M&M-like  conferences  are  of great \nvalue  as  a  teaching  tool  for  patient  management.  Stifling  any  discussions  of these  cases \nis  a detriment to  the  JMS  since  it deprives  the  nursing  staffteam  an  outlet  to  reflect  upon \nand  review poor or avoidable  outcomes. \nF9.  Both  the  NCCHC  visit  and  SCGJ  investigation  independently  came  to  many  of the  same \nconclusions  concernin(cid:127)  issues  with  the  JNP. \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 80 of 185\nRECOMMEN DATIONS \nRI.  Clinical  perlbrmance  of the  involved  I,VN  should  be  evaluated  by  RN  supervisors  on  a \nregular  basis  and  reported  to  the JNM.  The JNM  and  the  AD  should  then  review \noversight and  pcrfommnce  of the  LVN  to  determine  if the  LVN  meets  minimum  nursing \nstandards. \nWhen  present  during  an  emergency  situation  the JNM  should  assume  lull  responsibility \nas  the  lead  RN  to  ensure  professional  quality  medical  care.  The  JNM  should  be  more \naccessible  when  asked  for guidance  by jail  nursing  stall\" regarding  inmate  care  and  be \n(cid:127)nore  available  to  assist  as  needed. \nR3.  The JNM  must ensure all  JMS  staff is  thoroughly  Pamiliar  with  the  new JMS  Policy \n#16-506,  which  outlines  parameters  for  abnormal  vital  signs  and  required  actions. \nR4.  The  AD  should  evaluate  and  make  changes  to  ensure  the  person  in  the  position  of JNM  is \ncapable  of fulfilling  all job  responsibilities.  This  could  entail  periodic  feedback  tiom  the \nnursing  staff,  direct  observation,  and  frequent  evaluations  of the  JNM's  leadership \nmore \nabilities. \nRS.  Every  effom  should  be  made  by  the  .INM,  AD.  aad  !t0  to  finalize  and  implement  all \nP&P's  and  make  them  available  on  the  intranet.  Thereafter,  all  P&P's  should  be \nreviewed  and  updated  annually. \nR6.  The JNM  should  encourage  and  foster  a  learning  environment  fbr the  nursing  stall  They \nshould  have  opportunities  to  attend  continuing education  courses  and  arrangements \nshould  be  made  for  in-house  training  relating  to  direct  patient  care,  i.e.  man  down,  suicide \nprevention,  etc. \nR7.  After a death  or poor outcome  at  the jail  clinic,  the  tt0  should  conduct  M&M-tike \nconferences  with  the  AD  and  all  JMS  staff present.

Ihe  average \ndaily  population  ranges  from  180  to  230  inmates.  The  Sutter County  Health  Dep,'u-tment \nprovides  health  services.  As  is  true  across  the  count(cid:127)',  the  Sutter  County  Jail  is  experiencing  a \nrise  in  health  care  costs  and  the  number of inmates  with  health  problems  entering  from  the \ncommunity.  As  a  result,  the  counry  recognized  a  need  to  review  its  health-care  delivery  system \nin  the jail  and  requested  the  National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  (NCCItC)  to \nassess  and  propose solutions  to  improve  its  health  care  management  and  costs.  In November \n201 l,  the NCCHC  conducted  an  on-site  review of the  Sutter  County  Jail.  This  report  reflects  our \nfindings  and  recommendations  that  may  help  to  improve  access  and  quality,  of care  at  the  Sutter \nCounty Jail. \nMethodology \nNCCHC's  main  objective  in  this  technical  assistance  was  to  review  and  compare  Sutter  County \nJail's  health  sen, ices  delivery  system  against accepted  national  standards  and  practices  for jail \nhealth  organization.  Our goal,  through  this  comparative  analysis,  is  to  provide  specific \ncare \nrecomJnendations  to  facilitate jail  health  services.  To  assess  the  efficiency  and  effcctiveness  of \noperational \njail  health  services  NCCHC  used  a  methodological  approach  that focused  on  current \nissues.  First,  we  interviewed  key perso(cid:127)mel,  including  the  medical  director,  health  administrator, \njail  physician,  practitioner,  health  and  mental  health  staff.  We  reviewed  existing  policies \nnurse \nand  procedures,  and  a  few  medical  records.  We  analyzed  health  care  management  practices \nagainst  NCCHC's Standards Jbr  Health  Services  in .,rails  (2008). \nChief Finding \n\"t\"he  responsible  health  authority  is  creating  policies,  procedures,  and  clinical \nguidelines/nursing  protocols  that  will  guide  staff in  the  management of jail  health  services.  These \n201.2 \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 97 of 185\nSUTFER  COUNTY JAil_,  CALIFORNIA \npolicies,  procedures,  and  guidelines  have  not  been  vetted,  nor  has  staff\" bccn  trained.  Althougli \ntraining  is  planned,  the  lack  of strategic  planning,  devel(cid:127)ped  policies  and  procedures,  and \nconsistent  leadership  in  the  application  of those  policies  and  procedures  have  greatly  hampered. \nthe  delivery  of health  services  at  the  Surter  Counb;  Jail. \nFindings  on  Operational  Issues \nGovernance  and  Administration \nAccess  to  Care.  In  our  discussions  with  health  staff,  we  believe  that  inmates  can  access \nhealth  services  through  written  requests that  are triaged  daily.  Im-nates  are  instructed  on  how to \naccess  health  services  during  the  intake  process.  Interviews  and  health  record  documentation \nconfirm  that  inmates  have  access  to  needed  care. \nResponsible  Health  Authority.  The  responsible  health  authority  (RHA)  is  the  county \nhealth  department,  whose  on-site  representative  is  a  physician  (medical  director).  A  health \nservices  administrator  (nurse)  is  responsible  Ibr  the  overall  daily  operation  of the  health  service \nprogram.  Mental  health  services  are  provided  through  a  county  community  mental  health  system \nand  a  contracted  psychiatrist.  This  arrangement  appears  to  function  well  and  services  are \ncoordinated. \nMedical  Autonomy.  Our  review of the  health  records  and  interviews  confirmed  that  all \nclinical  decisions  perlaining  to  direct  health  care  of patients  are  the  sole  responsibility  of the \nmedical  director  and  clinical  staff. \nAdminislrafivc  Meelings  and  Reports.  The  medical  administralion  meets  with jail \nadministration  on  a  regular  basis  to  strategicall)  plan  how  to  improve  health  service  efficiency \nand  overall  clinical  operations.  Data  mmmgement  could  be  improved  to  assess  health  services.  A \nsample  of statistical  data  that  should  be  collected  is  provided  in  Appendix  A.  The  health services \nrummager should  be  responsible  for collecting this  information  and  sharing  it  with  the  medical \ndirector  and j all  administration. \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  2012 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 98 of 185\nSUTTER  COUNTY JAIL,  CALIFORNIA \nPolicies  and  Procedures.  The  medical  director  is  working on  the  ?olicies  and \nprocedures  and  is  using  the  NCCHC's  ,S'ta;(cid:127)dardsfor  Hea!lk  Services  in Jails  (2008)  as  the \nfoundational  fi'amework,  Once  completed,  the  manual  will  be  available  to  staff.  We  reviewed \nfew  stunplc  policies  and  found  them  to  be  consisten(cid:127)  w'ifl(cid:127)  national  practices. \nContinuous  Quality  Improvement  I'rogram.  The  Sutter  County  Jail's  health  services \nquality  improvement  program  needs  to  be  re-assessed.  Studies  on  t(cid:127)rocess  or  outcome  have not \nbeen  performed  to  meet  the  goals  for quality  of care.  The  Institute  of Medicine's  (IOM)  2001 \nreport,  Crossing  the  Quality  Chasm:  A  New  Health System for  the  21st  Century,  states  that  health \nshould be  safe,  effective,  patient-centered,  timely,  efficient,  and  equitable.  While health \ncare \nstaff attempt to  meet  these objectives,  there  has  been  no  effective  process  that  studies  the  quality \nof health  care provided  in  the jail.  A  registered  nurse  reviews  charts,  but the  data from  these \nreviews  is  limited to  documentation  issues  and  does  not  evaluate  the  clinical  care.  The  chart \nreviews  include  no  information  regarding  the  quality  of care  provided.  In  the  appendix,  we \nprovide  a sample  outcome  study  on  diabetic  care.  Using  this  template, jail  health  managers \nshould  begin  to  monitor  the  provision  of health  services. \nCommunication  on  Patient's  Health  Needs,  Communication  occurs  between  the \nfacility  administration  (cid:127)ad  treating  clinicians  in  such  a way  that  patient  health  needs  are \nappropriately  managed  and  addressed.  Health  staff,  when  asked,  advises  classification  and \ncustody  staff of an  irmaate's  special  health  needs  that  may  affect  housing,  work  assig(cid:127)w(cid:127)ents, \nprogram  assigmnents,  disciplina(cid:127)  measures,  and  admissions  to  and  lransfers  fi'om  satellite \nfacilities  and  other  institutions. \nProcedure  in  the  Event  of Inmate  Death,  There  have  been  tt(cid:127)ee  hmaate  deaths  at  the \nSut-ter  County  Jail  during  the  past  ).'ear and  a  half.  One  of these  deaths  was  a  suicide. \nAdministrative  and  clinical  reviews  were  completed.  We  did  not  review these  documen'{s. \n2012 \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  ttealth  Care \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 99 of 185\n \nSUTTER  COUNTY JAIL,  CALIFORNIA \nManagin,(cid:127)  a  Safe  and  Healthy  Environment \nInfection  Control  Program.  The jail's  infection  control  program  is  a combined  efforl  of \nrepresentatives  of the  facility's  administration,  the  county  health  depa(cid:127)ment,  the  medical \ndirector,  and  other  health  care  personnel.  Inmates  are  screened  and  obse(cid:127),ed  (cid:127)br  hepatitis, \ntuberculosis,  sexually  transmitted  intEctions,  scabies,  lice,  HIV,  and  AIDS.  Inmates  are \nquestioned  specifically  about  cmvent  symptoms  of tuberculosis.  The  facility  does  not  have \nnegative  air-flow  cells  and  imnates  identified  ttuough  a  chest  x-ray  to  be  positive  lbr  active  TB \n(cid:127)e  rct(cid:127)ed  to  the  county  health  depa(cid:127)ment  and  local  hospital.  Inmates  testing  positive  for \nreportable  sexually  tr(cid:127)smitted  int?ctions  (STIs)  are  prescribed  appropriate  antibiotic  therapy. \nHealth  perso(cid:127)el  p(cid:127)ticipatc  in  mmual  infection  control  in-service  training.  It  appears  that  the \njail  has  ma  et1(cid:127)ctive  infection  control  program  in  place. \nPatient  Safety.  The  RtlA  promotes  patient  safety  by  instituting  systems  to  prevent \nadverse  m(cid:127)d  near-miss  clinical  events.  This  is  accomplished  by  infor(cid:127)ning  health  staff of the \nincident  repot*  process  during  orientation  mad  daily  communications  with  the  medical  direclor. \nWe  believe  that staff effectively  works  to  monitor patient  safety. \nPersonnel  and  Training \nCredentialing.  tealth  personnel  are  appropriately  credentialed  according  to  the  state's \nticensure,  certitication,  and  registration  requirements.  The  health  department  follows  a \nformalized  credentialing  process.  We  did  not  verify  CPR  certification  for  all  qualifying  health \nprofessionals. \ncare \nClinical  Performance  Enhancement.  There  is  no  documentation  that  an  armual  clinical \nperformance  of primary  care  providers  is  conducted  and  shared  with  the  clinician  being \nreviewed. \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  2012 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 100 of 185\nSUI-[ER  COUNTY JAIL,  CALIFORNIA \nMedication  Administration  Training.

We did  not  examine  the  medications;  however,  the  practitioners  noted \nthat  pharmaceutical  ope]a'(cid:127)ions  are  sufficient to  mee(cid:127)  the needs  of inmates. \nMedication  Services.  The  medical  director  approves  the prescriptive  practices  at  the  site \nand  we  did  not  find  any  irregularities.  There  is  no  keep-on-person  (KOP)  system  which  allows \ninhalers,  antibiotics,  thiazides,  cardiac  medications,  nitroglycerin,  Dilantin,  Zantac,  and  prenatal \nvitamins  to  be  kept  by  inmates  when  prescribed  by  the  health  care  provider.  A  KOP  system \nincludes  training  tbr  inmates  to  take  care  of their  health  care  needs,  and  helps  to  reduce  the \nburden  of medication  distribution  in  the jail.  A  s(cid:127)nple  KOP  policy  is  atlached. \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  Itealth  Care  2012 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 101 of 185\n \nR  COUNTY JAIL,  CALIFORNIA \nClinic  Space,  Equipment,  and  Supplies.  The  clinic  area  is  small  but  suffivient;  it \nincludes  one  examination  room,  and  a  large  central  nurse's  statiordclcrical  office.  There  is \nsufficient  equipment  to  provide  health  services  to  the  imnates.  An  interview  roon(cid:127)/ot:fice  is  also \nacross  the  hall  ti-om  tt(cid:127)e  clinic  area. \nInmate  Care  And  Treatment \nInformation  on  ltealth  Services.  Inmates  aie  instra.(cid:127)cted  about  the  availability  of;  and \naccess  to,  health  care  upon  their  arrival  at  the  facility.  We  saw  no  posted  signs  in  the  int(cid:127)e  area \nabout  access  to  health  care  services  and  recommend  that  such  signs  be  posted  (in  English  and \nSpanish).  Imnates  are  given  writ-ten  information  on  how  to  access  health  care  services.  Access \nto  emergency  and  routine  health  care  services  is  described  in  the  inmate  handbook. \nReceiving  Screening.  Adtnissions  arrive  directly  from  the  community.  Corrcclional \nofficers  complete  the  receiving  screening  and  nurses  review  each  one.  The  receiving  screening \ntbrm  does  not  include  all  the  requirements  of the  standm'd.  Attached  is  a  sample  receiving \nscreening  form  that  we  recommend  be  used. \nHealth  Assessment.  An  initial  health  assessment  is  offered  to  each  i(cid:127)nale  within  14 \ncalendar days  of admission.  The  nurse  practitioner  completes  the  initial  health  assessment.  'lhe \nphysicim(cid:127)  reviews  the  health  assessment  forms  when  there  are  significant  medical  findings.  Our \nreview  of completed  health  assessments  found  them  to  be  thorough. \nMental  Health  Screening  and  Evaluation.  Trained  correctional  officers  complete  the \nmental  health  screening.  Patients  are  referred  to  the  (cid:127)nental  health  staff',','hen  there  are  positive \nfindings.  The  mental  health  worker completes  the  mental  h(cid:127):alth  evaluation. \nOral  Care.  Trained  lkNs  complete  the  oral  screenings  during the  intake  screening. \nInmates  approaching  12  months  of incarceration  are  not  offered  an  ammal  oral  health \nexamination  by the  off-site  dentist.  Oral  care  is  limited  to  relief of pain  and  infection.  There  is  a \nbacklog  of dental  sick  call  requests. \nNational  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  2012 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 102 of 185\nSU'I-rER  COUNTY JAIL,  CALIFORNIA \nNonemergency  ltealth  Care  Requests  and  Se(cid:127)wices.  Inmates  cma  request  medical, \ndental  or  mental  heallh  services  daily.  However,  the  nurse  practitioner's  daily  case  load  is \napproximately  nine  inmates  a  day.  The  patient  flow  is  limited  and  not  well  organized  and  i(cid:127)maate \nrequests  ea'e  not  honored  on  a  timely  basis:  At  the  time  of the  sur(cid:127)'ey,  the  inmate  sick  call  request \nbacklog  ranged  tiom  one  day  to  four  months.  \"I-he  nurse practitioner was  working  on  sick  call \nrequests  from  June.  On  a  daily  average,  it  is  expected  that  15  patients  would  be  seen  in  a \n:,orrectional  health  care  clinic,  tt  was  reported  that  it takes  three  weeks  (21  days)  on  average  to \ncomplete  the  health  assessment. \nNursing  Assessment  l'rotocols.  Prior  to  the  on-site  audit,  nursing protocols  had  not \n>een  used.  However,  the  medical  director  has  drafted  a  policy  for the  use  of nursing  protocols. \nWe  reviewed  the draft  and  found  that the  two  main  elements  lbr protocols  are  addressed.  First, \n:here  are  no  standing orders  for prescription  medications,  and  second,  there  are  requirements  that \n,qther the physician or  nurse  practitioner  sign  off on  all  nurse-generated  protocols.  We \nrecommend  that  nursing  assessment  protocols  be  ffflty implemented  at the  Sutter  County  Jail.  A \n;ample nursing  protocol  is  attached. \nContinuity  of Care  During  Incarceration.  Referrals  to  specialist  care  are  careflally \nnonitored.  It  takes  approximately  two  to  three  weeks  to  see  a  specialist.

Sample  guidelines  are  provided. \nBasic  Mental  Health  Sen'ices.  A  mental  health  counselor  provides  services  30  hours  a \nweek  (Monday  through  Friday).  A psychiatrist  provides  10  hours  of care  a  week.  Custody  staff \nconducts  a mental  health  receiving  screening  and  the  nurse  will  review  the  form  when  she \narrives.  Any  inmate  with  positive  findings  will  be  referred  to  the  mental  health  counselor  for \nevaluation.  Crisis  intervention  is  provided  by  the  counselor;  however,  there  is  no  group \ncounseling  (coping  skills,  medication  compliance,  or wo(cid:127)ncn's  group). \nSuicide  Prevention  Program.  The  suicide  prevention  program  addresses  each  of the  12 \naspects  ofplarming  as  described  by  the  standard.  However,  when  an  irmaatc  is  placed  on  suicide \nwatch,  15-minute  watches  are  conducted,  instead  of on  an  intermittenl  schedule,  as  required  by \nthe standard.  The  mental  health  staffwill  release  an  irunate  fi'om  suicide  watch.  The  psychiatrist \nis  minimally  involved. \nIntoxication  and  Withdrawal.  Individuals  with  symptoms  of inloxication  or \nwithdrawal  are  managed  on  site  by  nursing  staff.  Individuals  with  severe  withdrawal  or \nintoxication  are  senl  to  the  hospital.  Staffdo  not  use  the  CIAW-R  to  monitor  intoxication.  A \ncopy  of the  CIAW-R  is  attached  and  wc  recommend  that  nursing  staff be  trained  to  use  this \npatient  monitoring  tool. \nCare  of the  Pregnant  Inmate.

In  the  appendix  we  provide  a  st(cid:127)mple  MPI.  and  recommend  its  use. \nConclusion \nOverall,  the  health  staff provide  health  services  with  limited  resources  and  are  to  be \ncommended  for their efforl.  However,  several  recommendations  have  been  made  in  this  report \nthat,  if implemented,  can  improve  the overall  quality  of care:  1)  Jail  health  administration  should \nimprove  its  metrics  to  evaluate  operational  issues.  A  sample  of statistical  data that  should  be \ncollected  is  provided  and  we  recommend  its  consistent  use.  2)  The  medical  director  should \ncomplete  the  policies  and  procedures  manual  so  that  it  is  consistent with NCCHC's  Standards \nfi)r Health Services  in Jails  (2008).  3)  There  should  be  efforts  to  improve  the  qualiD' \nimprovement  program  with  one  study  on  process  and  another  on  outcome.  There  has  been  no \neffective  process  that  studies  the  quality  of health  care  provided  in  the jail.  4)  An  annual  clinical \nperformancc  of' the  physician,  nurse  practitioner,  and  psychiatrist  is  to  be  conducted  and  shared \nwith  the  clinician  being  reviewed.  5)  In  our  experience,  full-time  equivalent  health  sial'f should \ninclude  40  hours  of psychiatrist's  time  for  1,000  imnatcs.  More  psychiatrist's  time  is  needed  at \nthe  Sut(cid:127)er  County  Jail.  We  recommend  that the  psychiatrist  time  be  increased  to  0.4  from  0.1 \nhours.  6)  Many jails  have  a  keep-on-person  (KOP)  system  that  allows  inmates  to  keep  inhalers, \nantibiotics,  thiazides,  cardiac  medications,  nitroglycerin,  Dilantin,  Zantac,  and  prenatal  vitmnins \nwhen  prescribed  by  the  health  providers.  We  recommend  that  a  KOP  system  be  considered.  It \nwill  help  to  relieve  some  of the  duties  and  tasks  nurses  are  required  to  perform.  7)  There  should \n9c  signs  posted  in  the  intake  area  about  the  availabili D'  of,  and  access  1o,  heall]n  care  in  the \nfacility,  8)  The  receiving  screening  foma  should  be  revised  so  that  it  conforms  to  national \n(cid:127)tandards.

In  this \nguided  by  exceptionally  dedicated  Board  of Directors  comprised  of representatives \nwe  are  an \nfrom  supporling  organizations. \nour \nNCCHC's origins  date  to  the  early  1970s,  when  an  American  Medical  Association  study  of jails \nfound  inadequate,  disorganized  health  services  and  a  lack  of national  standards.  In  collaboration \nwith  other  organizations,  the  ANLA  established  a program  that  in  the  early  1980s  became  the \nNational  Commission  on Correctional  Heallh  Care,  an  independent,  not-for-profit  501 (c)(3) \norganization  whose  e(cid:127)ly  mission  was  to  evaluate  and  develop  policy  and  programs  for  a  field \nclearly  in  need  of assistance. \nToday,  NCCHC's  leadership  in  setting  standards  tbr health  smwices  in  correctional  facilities  is \nwidely  recognized.  Established  by'  the  health,  legal  and  corrections  professions,  NCCI tC's \nStandards  are  recormnendations  for the  management  of a  correctional  health  services  system. \nWritten  in  separate  volumes  tbr  prisons, jails  and juvenile  confinement  facilities--(cid:127)md  now  with  a \nmanual  specifically  for  mental  health  services--the  Standards  cover  the  areas  of care  and \ntreatment,  health records,  a&ninistration,  personnel  aa(cid:127)d  medical-legal  issues.  These  essential \nhave  helped  correctional  and  detention  facilities  improve the health  of their  inrnates \nresources \nand  the  conu-nunities  to  which  they  return,  increase  the  efficiency  of health  services  delivery, \nstren(cid:127)hen  organizational  effectiveness  and  reduce  the  risk  of adverse  legal judgments. \nBuilding  on  that  foundation,  NCCHC  offers  a  broad  array  of ser(cid:127),ices  and  resources  to  help \ncorrectional  health  care  systems  provide  efficient,  high-quality  care. \nThe National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care has  no  membership  or  dues.

At  any  given  time,  over  2 \nple  incarcerated  in  prisons  and jails  in  the U.S.  It is  estimated  that  nearly \nare \n(cid:127)ese  irmnates  have diabetes  a prevalence  of 4.8%.

It  should  be perfbrmed  routinely in  all \nh  diabetes,  at  initial  assessment  and  then  as  part  of continuing  care.  T!(cid:127)e \net  value  from  the  American  Diabetic  Association  is  <7%. \n%r poor  initial  control  is  multi-factorial  and  include:  1)  poor  self \nof their disease prior  to  incarceration;  2)  availability  of canteen  privileges \n(cid:127)e  infirmary setting;  3)  trading to  obtain  canteen  privileges  and  consuming \ndietary  items;  4)  lack  of understanding their  disease  process  m(cid:127)d  how  !ire- \nplay  important  role. \nm(cid:127) \nInitial  and  {bllow-up  Hbg  A1C  values  were  collected  on  ten patients  e(cid:127)olled \n(cid:127)ic  Cm-e  Clinics.  Diabetic patients  are  seen  in  the  Chronic  Care  Clinic  for \n:very  90-120  days.

Two  of the ten  essentially remained  the  same  (7.1  and  5.5 \nto  stmt  and  7.2  and  5.6  respectively  at  follow-up).

However,  given  that  2  of the patients  remained \nstable with  initially low  Hbg A1C's  gives  that  50%  of the  sample remained  stable or \nimproved.  Interestingly,  7/8  of those with  follow-up  levels  done  showed  values between \n5.6  and  7.3.  This  indicates  that  their control  was  still  'pretty  good '.  Twenty  percent of \nthe patients  did  not have  Hbg A1C's  ordered  by the  Providers.  Tkis  was  addressed \nduring  subsequent  staff meetings  in March  and  April.  Our Health Care  Providers  will \nneed  to  strengthen  their partnership  in  the management  of their diabetes.  Follow-up \nstudies  will  also  examine  correlations  between  control  and  other  factors  such  as  type  of \nmedication,  dietary compliance,  level  of' activity,  commissary  status,  etc. \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 116 of 185\nSample \nNursing \nProtocols \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 117 of 185\nDOC-3:)O7 (Roy. lJ03) \nWISCONSIN  EFFECTIVE DATE  NUMBER \nDepartment  of  Corrections  May  l,  2004  300:1S \nHealth  Services  UNIfSAFFEG]ED  SUPERCEDESNO \nDAI,  DJC,  BIIS \nPOLICY/PROCEDURE  DAlE REVISED \nSUBJECT  2/11/04 \nNursing Protocols  PAGE  OF \nPOLICY: \nNursing  Protocols are  developed and  authorized  by the  Bureau of Health  Services to  provide  Registered  Nurses  wilh \nguidelines  for assessment and management of con(cid:127)non  health conditions  in  the Wisconsin Department of Corrcclious \npatient population. \nRegistered Nt,rses  utilize nursing protocols  approved by a physiciau as  a  delegated medical act.

A pafier:t  declared emergency may, at the nurses'  discretion,  be briefly assessed through bars  for the \nurgcncy of the complaint.  If urgent,  the patient should  be taken  (cid:127).o  a(cid:127)  examination room  for evaluation and a \ncomplete  assessment performed,  including vital  signs.  If possible,  the  patient's  complete health record should be  m \nhand,  available  for review.  If non-urgent,  the patient should  be  instrucled to  submit a  health services  request  form. \nMedical  versus  Nursing Diagnosis \nIn  usiug the protocols,  it is important to make  a distinctiou  between  medical  and  nursing diagnosis.  A medical \ndiagnosis  is made by physicians  or other p(cid:127)actitioners  who are  qualified and  licensed to do so.  Nursing diagnosis  is a \ndeviation  [(cid:127)rom  an  individual'(cid:127)  normal stale  of health.

In general,  it should be avoided and  other,  more specific nursing diagnoses \nused,  such as  fever,  chest pain or \"disconffort comfort secondary to the problem such  as  ear pain.\" \nMultiple Complaint Patients \nPatients  may present with a  number of problems which  if taken  literally,  may require the performance of five  or more \nassessments.  While these complaints should never be taken lightly,  it is  possible to  focus the  visit in one or two \nmeaningful  areas by asking the  patient the  relative  importance  of each complaint,  in  addition  to the nurse's \nassessment of their urgency. \nVital Signs \nVital  sign should  generally  be taken  for all nursing encounters.  If an  inmate/youth  is being seen regularly (e.g. \nweekly)  for follow-up of a stable condition such  as  an  ongoing,  non-acute dermatological  problem il may not be \nnecessary to take vital  signs.  All  encounters resulting in a refen-al to a practitioner should have vital  signs taken. \nVilal  signs that  fall  above or below the thresholds described should  be  referred  on  an  urgent basis.  This  requires \nphone consul*ation  (cid:127)vith  an  advanced  lcvet provider.  \"l'here  may be circum,stances  where  vital  signs  within the \nidentified thresholds  is  still  considered  abnormal  and  should  be referred  (i.e.  patient with  a  chronic condition  such  as \ntransplant with a temperature  of 10 I) \nThe nurse must be cognizant of objective data which requires referral  regardless  of the presenting complaint of the \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 137   Filed 03/03/14   Page 120 of 185\nDOC-3007 (hey 1/03)  [NUMBER \nPOLICY  PROCEDURE  EFFECTIVE DArE \nMay  1,  2004  300:18 \npatient.

This case involves NATHAN PRASAD, a young man denied basic \n3 emergency life-saving treatment for a serious infection while detained at Sutter County Jail \n4 on minor, non-violent charges.  In the course of his approximately one-week detention, \n5 NATHAN PRASAD’s condition deteriorated from an infection wholly treatable through \n6 basic and timely medical attention to an extraordinarily painful death as a result of Sutter \n7 County Jail’s failure to provide treatment.  Sutter County Jail’s failure was despite \n8 documented observation of his emergent medical problems, including coughing up blood, \n9 deteriorating vital signs, and desperate pleas for help by NATHAN PRASAD and other jail \n10 inmates. \n11 2.  After reporting to jail staff that he was experiencing enormous pain in his \n12 lower extremities, he was brought to Rideout Memorial Hospital on January 26, 2011 for \n13 further evaluation.  Following diagnostic testing on his lower extremities, hospital staff \n14 discharged NATHAN PRASAD back to the jail.   Doctors provided to jail staff Defendants \n15 explicit direction that NATHAN PRASAD be returned to the emergency room \n16 immediately if his symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.  Hospital staff knew or \n17 should have known, however, that the jail’s policies and procedures made such immediate \n18 return extremely unlikely if not impossible.  Hospital staff knew or should have known \n19 that jail policies prohibited custody staff from summoning medical attention when jail \n20 medical staff were not present, and that jail medical staff were not present during lengthy \n21 periods of the day and night. \n22 3.  Upon his return to Sutter County Jail, NATHAN PRASAD’s symptoms \n23 worsened dramatically, and new alarming symptoms developed.  Jail staff observed and \n24 documented that NATHAN PRASAD was experiencing tremendous pain, coughing up \n25 blood, and telling them that he was afraid he would die without medical care.  Basic \n26 medical diagnostic evaluation at the jail showed that his vital signs indicated extreme \n27 danger.  Fellow inmates desperately sought medical help for NATHAN PRASAD, going \n28 so far as to collect the blood he coughed up in a used milk carton. \n[579099-7]    1 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 3 of 59\n \n1 4.  Despite these facts, jail staff ignored NATHAN PRASAD’s serious medical \n2 needs, instead ridiculing him and leaving him to continue to deteriorate in his cell and at \n3 the jail. \n4 5.  After almost two days of deterioration and suffering at the jail, NATHAN \n5 PRASAD’s condition became so serious that his blood pressure could no longer be \n6 detected at all and he was losing consciousness.  His condition was so deteriorated at this \n7 stage that subsequent life-saving measures could not revive him. \n8 6.  NATHAN PRASAD fell into a coma and died on January 28, 2011, at the \n9 age of 30.  He left behind two young children, T.P. and A.P., with whom he had a close \n10 and loving relationship, and who he helped to support financially and emotionally.  He \n11 further left behind his mother, MARY PRASAD, with whom he remained exceptionally \n12 close throughout his life and in the months prior to his death.  Neither MARY PRASAD, \n13 nor T.P., nor A.P was able to make it to NATHAN PRASAD’s bedside to see him before \n14 he passed away. \n15 7.  Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to NATHAN PRASAD’s \n16 serious medical needs, and in violation of their duties under federal and state law, causing \n17 NATHAN PRASAD’s tragic and preventable death. \n18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19 8.  This case is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Jurisdiction is based on \n20 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  With respect to those claims brought pursuant to California \n21 law, Plaintiffs have complied with the administrative claim requirement. \n22 9.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state claims pursuant \n23 to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n24 10.  The claims alleged herein arose in the County of Sutter, California.  \n25 Therefore, venue in the Eastern District of California is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n26 § 1391(b)(2). \n27 PARTIES \n28 11.  Plaintiffs’ decedent is NATHAN PRASAD, who, at the time of his death, \n[579099-7]    2 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 4 of 59\n \n1 was a 30-year old citizen of the United States.

Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP was at all times \n9 mentioned herein responsible for the operation of Rideout Memorial Hospital.  Defendant \n10 FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP had and maintained a contractual agreement \n11 with COUNTY OF SUTTER to provide medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, \n12 including for the purpose of providing ambulance and emergency services.  The process by \n13 which Rideout Memorial Hospital provided treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates \n14 involved significant, ongoing coordination and cooperation between COUNTY OF \n15 SUTTER, the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department, and Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT \n16 HEALTH GROUP.  On information and belief, Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT \n17 HEALTH GROUP’s Rideout Memorial Hospital is the only facility made available to Jail \n18 inmates for the delivery of emergency medical services.  Defendant FREMONT-\n19 RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP established and follows a policy, procedure and practice of \n20 receiving jail inmates from Sutter County Jail, and discharging them to Sutter County Jail \n21 in a manner that is deliberately indifferent to the known risk of serious or lethal injury in \n22 the event, as in the case of NATHAN PRASAD, where the discharge instructions depend \n23 on a capacity for emergency medical response that Fremont-Rideout Health Group knew \n24 or should have known did not exist at Sutter County Jail. \n25 25.  Defendant MICHAEL FRATERS was at all relevant times mentioned herein \n26 a physician at Rideout Memorial Hospital and employee of FREMONT-RIDEOUT \n27 HEALTH GROUP.

Defendant FRATERS had direct \n2 contact with NATHAN PRASAD on January 26, 2010, had actual notice of NATHAN \n3 PRASAD’s serious and life-threatening condition and need for access to emergency \n4 medical treatment, and acted with deliberate indifference to the known risk of serious or \n5 lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD given that a safe discharge from the hospital \n6 depended on the capacity for emergency medical response that he knew or should have \n7 known did not exist at Sutter County Jail.  Defendant FRATERS is being sued in his \n8 individual capacity.   \n9 26.  The true names and identities of Defendants DOES I through XX are \n10 presently unknown to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege that each of Defendants DOES I through \n11 XX was employed by the COUNTY OF SUTTER and/or the Sutter County Sheriff’s \n12 Department at the time of the conduct alleged herein.  Plaintiffs allege that each of \n13 Defendants DOES I through XX was deliberatively indifferent to NATHAN PRASAD’s \n14 medical needs and safety, failed to provide necessary care to him or to take other measures \n15 to violated his civil rights, wrongfully caused his death, and/or encouraged, directed, \n16 enabled and/or ordered other defendants to engage in such conduct. Plaintiffs further allege \n17 that Defendants DOES I through XX violated Plaintiffs’ First and Fourteenth Amendment \n18 rights, and rights under California state law. Plaintiffs will seek to amend this Complaint as \n19 soon as the true names and identities of Defendants DOES I through XX have been \n20 ascertained. \n21 27.  The true names and identities of Defendants DOES XXI though XL are \n22 presently unknown to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that each of Defendants DOES XXI \n23 through XL was employed by the COUNTY OF SUTTER and/or the Sutter County \n24 Sheriff’s Department at the time of the conduct alleged herein.  Plaintiffs allege that each \n25 of Defendants DOES XXI through XL was responsible for the hiring, screening, training, \n26 retention, supervision, discipline, counseling, and control of medical, mental health, and \n27 jail custody employees and/or agents involved in the conduct alleged herein.  Plaintiffs \n28 allege that each of Defendants DOES XXI through XL was also responsible for and caused \n[579099-7]    7 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 9 of 59\n \n1 the acts and injuries alleged herein.  Plaintiffs will seek to amend this Complaint as soon as \n2 the true names and identities of Defendants DOES XXI through XL have been ascertained. \n3 28.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER is a political subdivision of the State of \n4 California, created and existing by virtue of the laws of the State of California.  At all \n5 times relevant to the instant complaint, Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER employed \n6 Defendants J. PAUL PARKER, DAVID SAMSON, NORMAN BIDWELL, DORIS \n7 BROWN, MELODY YOUNG, BALJINDER RAI, SHANE DICKSON, UNKNOWN \n8 JAIL EMPLOYEE I, and DOES I through XL. \n9 29.  Defendants J. PAUL PARKER, DAVID SAMSON, NORMAN BIDWELL, \n10 DORIS BROWN, MELODY YOUNG, BALJINDER RAI, SHANE DICKSON, \n11 UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I, FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP, \n12 MICHAEL FRATERS, and DOES I through XL, and each of them, to the extent they \n13 engaged in any acts or omissions alleged herein, engaged in such acts or omissions under \n14 color of state law. \n15 30.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times \n16 mentioned in this Complaint, Defendants, and each of them, were the agents, employees, \n17 servants, joint venturers, partners and/or co-conspirators of the other Defendants named in \n18 this Complaint and that at all times, each of the Defendants was acting within the course \n19 and scope of said relationship with Defendants. \n20 EXHAUSTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES \n21 31.  Plaintiffs MARY PRASAD, T.P., and A.P. filed state governmental tort \n22 claims with the State and Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER, including on behalf of the \n23 ESTATE of NATHAN PRASAD, on July 21, 2011.  By correspondence dated September \n24 7, 2011, their governmental tort claims were rejected. \n25 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n26 Nathan Prasad’s Life and the Circumstances of His Detention in Sutter County Jail \n27 32.  NATHAN PRASAD was born on April 10, 1980 in Cedarville, California. \n28 33.  NATHAN PRASAD had a close relationship with his family, helping to \n[579099-7]    8 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 10 of 59\n \n1 raise his young children and assisting his mother and grandmother with various daily and \n2 household tasks.  Despite a history of mental illness, NATHAN PRASAD had made great \n3 strides in the time before his death towards becoming independent and self-sufficient.  \n4 After several years struggling with mental illness, he had moved into his own apartment \n5 for the first time in his life and was working towards gainful employment.  He spent most \n6 days with his family, including his elderly grandmother, his mother and step-father, and his \n7 children. \n8 34.  COUNTY OF SUTTER officials and employees – including individual \n9 Defendants, county mental health staff, county law enforcement, and county jail staff, had \n10 extensive contact with NATHAN PRASAD.  NATHAN PRASAD had been involuntarily \n11 hospitalized to receive emergency mental health treatment pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n12 Code § 5150, and had been placed in the custody of the Sheriff’s Department multiple \n13 times, generally during periods in which he was manifesting serious mental illness and in \n14 light of alleged non-violent parole and probation violations.  COUNTY OF SUTTER \n15 produced and maintained significant documentation of his mental health and medical \n16 needs.  This documentation was included in his Sutter County Jail inmate records, and, \n17 upon information and belief, reviewed by Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, BIDWELL, \n18 BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I. \n19 35.  COUNTY OF SUTTER arrested NATHAN PRASAD on or about \n20 January 21, 2011, based on non-violent misdemeanor and parole-related charges.  He was \n21 taken to Sutter County Jail, where he was detained for the next week.  During that time \n22 period, NATHAN PRASAD developed a medical condition which, as a result of the denial \n23 of plainly necessary treatment, led to great suffering and his painful death on January 28, \n24 2011. \n25 36.  At the time of NATHAN PRASAD’s death, T.P. was seven (7) years old, \n26 and A.P. was six (6) years old.  NATHAN PRASAD died just two (2) days before A.P.’s \n27 seventh birthday. \n28\n[579099-7]    9 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 11 of 59\n \n1 Medical Problems, Pain, and Suffering While Detained in Sutter County Jail \n2 37.  Soon after Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER’s arrest of NATHAN \n3 PRASAD, NATHAN PRASAD reported to jail staff that he was experiencing significant \n4 pain in his lower extremities.  He was further manifesting symptoms of mental illness.  Jail \n5 staff, including Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL \n6 EMPLOYEE I observed him on multiple occasions and documented that he was \n7 experiencing pain, swelling, and other serious medical symptoms. \n8 38.  While detained at Sutter County Jail, NATHAN PRASAD completed and \n9 submitted to jail staff multiple written requests to receive medical treatment.  In these \n10 reports, he reported that he was suffering “extreme pain,” was concerned that he had a \n11 staph infection, and stated that he required “emergency” medical attention. \n12 39.  After several days of reported and documented medical concerns, jail staff \n13 transported NATHAN PRASAD to Rideout Memorial Hospital for what was a brief \n14 medical evaluation.  A short time after his admission to the Emergency Department on \n15 January 26, 2011, emergency room physicians discharged NATHAN PRASAD with \n16 specific discharge instructions that if his symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, he \n17 was to be returned to the Emergency Department immediately.  He was discharged on the \n18 afternoon of January 26, and returned to Sutter County Jail. \n19 40.  Defendant FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP’s Rideout Memorial \n20 Hospital staff, acting pursuant to a COUNTY OF SUTTER contract to provide medical \n21 treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, acted with deliberate indifference by discharging \n22 NATHAN PRASAD to a notoriously dangerous setting at Sutter County Jail.  Hospital \n23 staff knew or should have known that NATHAN PRASAD would not possibly receive the \n24 observation, supervision, and access to emergent medical treatment he would likely need \n25 given his serious medical complaints and condition. \n26 41.  Defendant FRATERS, NATHAN PRASAD’S physician at Rideout \n27 Memorial Hospital, evaluated and treated NATHAN PRASAD at the hospital on \n28 January 26, as pursuant with the Hospital’s agreement to treat Sutter County Jail inmates.  \n[579099-7]    10 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 12 of 59\n \n1 Defendant FRATERS ordered and/or approved the discharge of NATHAN PRASAD.  At \n2 the time, he knew or should have known that NATHAN PRASAD had a serious and life-\n3 threatening condition and would need access to emergency medical treatment if his \n4 symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed. \n5 42.  Defendant FRATERS acted with deliberate indifference to the known risk of \n6 serious or lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD given that his safe discharge from the \n7 hospital depended on timely access to emergency medical response, which he knew or \n8 should have known did not exist at Sutter County Jail, a setting that is notoriously \n9 dangerous for individuals with serious medical needs and that does not provide sufficient \n10 around-the-clock access to medical care. \n11 43.  On information and belief, Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, and \n12 BIDWELL were informed and aware of, or should have been aware of, NATHAN \n13 PRASAD’s evaluation at Rideout Memorial Hospital and the discharge instructions \n14 providing that if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed, he must be taken to \n15 the emergency room immediately. \n16 44.  On information and belief, Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, \n17 and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I each reviewed and/or were aware of, or should have \n18 been aware of, NATHAN PRASAD’s custody file, including the medical documentation \n19 indicating his medical status and need to be taken to the emergency room immediately if \n20 his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed. \n21 45.  Throughout NATHAN PRASAD’s detention at Sutter County Jail, \n22 Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I \n23 failed to provide sufficient medical screening, evaluation, and observation of his medical \n24 condition and emergent treatment needs. \n25 Defendants’ Failure to Provide Clearly Necessary Life-Saving Emergency Treatment \n26 46.  Shortly upon his return from the brief hospital admission, it became readily \n27 apparent that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were in fact getting \n28 significantly worse.  His symptoms included vomiting, shortness of breath, severe chills, \n[579099-7]    11 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 13 of 59\n \n1 and extreme pain.  NATHAN PRASAD began coughing and/or vomiting up blood.  On the \n2 evening of January 26, 2011, jail staff documented speaking with Defendant BROWN that \n3 NATHAN PRASAD was suffering from “uncontrollable pain.”  Yet no follow-up \n4 evaluation or medical treatment was provided that night. \n5 47.  From January 26 to January 28, NATHAN PRASAD stated aloud repeatedly \n6 that he was in extreme pain and having trouble breathing.  He reported to staff that he \n7 thought he was going to die unless he received immediate medical attention.  He was \n8 manifesting numerous symptoms indicating a serious and life-threatening condition and an \n9 immediate need for emergency medical treatment.   \n10 48.  Several fellow inmates observed NATHAN PRASAD’s worsening condition \n11 and notified staff at the jail.  Staff responded that NATHAN PRASAD was faking his pain \n12 and other symptoms and that he and the inmates needed to “get over it.” \n13 49.  Fellow inmates collected the blood that NATHAN PRASAD was coughing \n14 up in an empty milk carton, and, upon information and belief, showed it to Defendants \n15 RAI, BROWN, YOUNG, DICKSON, UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I, and other staff in \n16 an effort to obtain emergency medical help for NATHAN PRASAD. \n17 50.  Jail staff, including Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and \n18 UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I observed NATHAN PRASAD’s suffering and heard his \n19 and his fellow inmates’ pleas for immediate medical help.  Defendants BROWN, \n20 YOUNG, and RAI documented NATHAN PRASAD’s complaints and worsening \n21 symptoms.  In spite of the alarming reports and the observations of Defendants, they failed \n22 to provide adequate evaluation or timely emergency treatment for a period of 36 hours or \n23 more.   \n24 51.  Defendant BROWN observed NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and \n25 reviewed the Emergency Department records and discharge instructions to return him to \n26 the hospital immediately if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  She \n27 observed and documented that he was continuing to experience pain and other serious, and \n28 worsening, symptoms, but took no steps to obtain the emergency medical care he \n[579099-7]    12 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 14 of 59\n \n1 obviously needed. \n2 52.  Defendant DICKSON, after observing NATHAN PRASAD screaming in \n3 pain and begging to be taken to the hospital for treatment, ridiculed NATHAN PRASAD.  \n4 Defendant DICKSON stated that he was the type of person who comes to jail because he \n5 wants to get free medical care.  Defendant DICKSON ignored NATHAN PRASAD’s \n6 serious medical condition, and took no steps to address his medical needs. \n7 53.  Defendant UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I, after observing NATHAN \n8 PRASAD screaming in pain and begging to be taken to the hospital for treatment.  \n9 Defendant UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I stated that he was getting what he deserved \n10 for whatever he had done, and would have to wait until later to see a doctor.  Defendant \n11 UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I ignored NATHAN PRASAD’s serious medical \n12 condition, and took no steps to address his medical needs. \n13 54.  In the pre-dawn hours of January 28, 2011, Defendants RAI and YOUNG \n14 observed and documented that NATHAN PRASAD’s blood pressure and blood-oxygen \n15 saturation were dangerously low, that he was coughing and/or vomiting up blood, dizzy, \n16 sweating, cold, and clammy.  On information and belief, he reported to Defendants RAI \n17 and YOUNG that he felt like he was “going to die.” \n18 55.  After several hours during which NATHAN PRASAD was exhibiting \n19 worsening symptoms and significant suffering and was pleading with jail staff for help, \n20 Defendants RAI and YOUNG placed NATHAN PRASAD in a Sutter County Jail office.  \n21 However, they held him in a jail office but provided him no medical treatment, and failed \n22 to properly monitor his deteriorating condition, for a period of nearly four (4) hours or \n23 more.  Defendants RAI and YOUNG did not call an ambulance or make other \n24 arrangements for NATHAN PRASAD to be taken to the hospital emergency room for \n25 emergency and life-saving medical care. \n26 56.  Instead, NATHAN PRASAD was made to sit in a jail office room, without \n27 medical attention of any kind, even as his condition got worse, including further coughing \n28 up of blood and deteriorating vital signs.  Not until nearly four hours later on January 28 \n[579099-7]    13 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 15 of 59\n \n1 was an ambulance summoned.  By that time, NATHAN PRASAD’s condition had \n2 deteriorated dramatically and his skin had turned blue due to severe oxygen deficiency and \n3 cyanosis.  His blood pressure could no longer be detected. \n4 57.  The failure of correctional officer Defendants RAI, DICKSON, UNKNOWN \n5 JAIL EMPLOYEE I to contact emergency medical services was consistent with a policy in \n6 effect at Sutter County Jail such that correctional officers did not have authority to \n7 determine who goes to the hospital or to call for an ambulance in an emergency situation, \n8 despite the lack of 24-hour medical staff availability at the jail.  Defendants PARKER, \n9 SAMSON, and BIDWELL created, were aware of, and enforced this policy, knowing that \n10 it would endanger inmates like NATHAN PRASAD who require emergency medical \n11 attention. \n12 NATHAN PRASAD’s Painful and Preventable Death \n13 58.  NATHAN PRASAD suffered severe bronchopneumonia and multiple organ \n14 failure as a result of Defendants’ failure to provide timely medical treatment.  He was \n15 deemed to be in critical condition and was unconscious, leading to his placement in the \n16 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Rideout Memorial Hospital. \n17 59.  Defendants failed to timely contact NATHAN PRASAD’s family.  As a \n18 result, his mother MARY PRASAD, his children T.P. and A.P., and other family members \n19 were unable to make it to the hospital in time to see NATHAN PRASAD while he was still \n20 alive. \n21 60.  Meanwhile, Defendants PARKER, SAMSON, and BIDWELL took steps to \n22 drop all pending charges and to release NATHAN PRASAD “on his own recognizance” \n23 after he was placed in the ICU and was in critical condition. \n24 61.  At approximately 4:19 pm on January 28, NATHAN PRASAD was \n25 pronounced dead by hospital staff. \n26 62.  Had NATHAN PRASAD not been placed in a jail setting known to be \n27 dangerous and ill-equipped to ensure timely emergency medical treatment, and had such \n28 emergency treatment been summoned and provided to NATHAN PRASAD, his condition \n[579099-7]    14 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 16 of 59\n \n1 could have been effectively treated.  He would not have experienced severe pain and \n2 suffering, and his life would have been saved. \n3 Longstanding and Systemic Deficiencies in Sutter County Jail’s Provision of \nEmergency Treatment to Inmates, Medical Staffing, and Policies and Procedures in \n4 Violation of Existing Court Order \n5 63.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER has knowingly maintained and tolerated \n6 longstanding and systemic deficiencies in the Sutter County Jail’s provision of emergency \n7 treatment to seriously ill inmates.  It has also knowingly had inadequate medical staffing as \n8 well as policies and procedures that were likely in violation of an existing court order \n9 directing minimum standards of medical treatment at the jail.  Defendants PARKER, \n10 SAMSON, and BIDWELL were aware of and tolerated these serious deficiencies in Sutter \n11 County Jail’s medical care system, policies, and procedures. \n12 64.  As identified by a Sutter County Grand Jury in its 2010-2011 Final Report, \n13 Sutter County Jail has had several known deficiencies in its system of providing treatment \n14 to inmates.  (The Sutter County Grand Jury Report is appended as Attachment A.) \n15 65.  Identified deficiencies included inadequate medical staffing, non-compliant \n16 medical policies and procedures, and a medical program that was long out-of-compliance.  \n17 The Grand Jury noted that such deficiencies were “unacceptable,” and may have caused \n18 Sutter County to be out of compliance with an existing court order in Haller v. Sutter \n19 County, Case No. CIV-S-93-1256, which mandates certain jail conditions, policies, and \n20 procedures for providing medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates. \n21 66.  The Grand Jury found that medical staffing at Sutter County Jail has been \n22 inadequate, and that the hiring of additional staff is required. \n23 67.  The Grand Jury noted a report that training of staff had not occurred in more \n24 than five (5) years as of 2011, and that such training was necessary to maintain proficiency \n25 in emergency response procedures.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail had \n26 failed to offer staff required training pursuant to court order and the jail’s own Medical \n27 Policies and Procedures. \n28 68.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s health care policies and \n[579099-7]    15 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 17 of 59\n \n1 procedures were significantly out of date, and that conditions at the jail had been allowed \n2 to “deteriorate.” \n3 69.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s nursing program was \n4 “completely out of compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard nursing \n5 procedures,” and found “unacceptable that the program is out of compliance, lack of \n6 training for the nursing staff, [and] not having the [policies and procedures] up-to-date,” \n7 among other problems. \n8 70.  The systemic deficiencies regarding the provision of emergency and other \n9 medical treatment at Sutter County Jail, as well as the inadequate staffing, policies, and \n10 procedures, as identified in the Grand Jury Report and in violation of the existing Haller v. \n11 Sutter County court order, directly caused the woefully inadequate emergency medical \n12 attention and treatment that NATHAN PRASAD required between January 26 and \n13 January 28, 2011, leading to his untimely and preventable death on January 28, 2011. \n14 71.  Defendants maintained insufficient policies and procedures, and provided \n15 inadequate staff training or no training at all, on the provision of emergency medical care \n16 to Sutter County Jail inmates with a serious and/or life-threatening medical condition.  \n17 These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, insufficient direction as to what \n18 circumstances require emergency medical care and the procedure for summoning \n19 emergency medical care.  These failures directly caused the denial of emergency medical \n20 attention and treatment that NATHAN PRASAD required between January 26 and January \n21 28, 2011, leading to his untimely and preventable death on January 28, 2011. \n22 72.  Sutter County Jail has recently experienced several likely preventable inmate \n23 deaths in custody, indicating a culture of deliberate indifference to inmates’ serious \n24 treatment needs at the Jail.  In addition to NATHAN PRASAD’s death, there have been \n25 disturbing reports of inmate deaths in April 2010 and September 2011. \n26 NATHAN PRASAD’s Mother and Young Children Have Been Profoundly Harmed \nby Defendants’ Misconduct Leading to NATHAN PRASAD’s Death \n27  \n28 73.  Plaintiffs MARY PRASAD, T.P., and A.P. have been profoundly harmed by \n[579099-7]    16 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 18 of 59\n \n1 Defendant’s conduct leading to NATHAN PRASAD’s untimely and avoidable death. \n2 74.  As NATHAN PRASAD’s mother, MARY PRASAD has experienced the \n3 painful loss of her eldest son.  She has been denied the regular contact that she and \n4 NATHAN PRASAD had.  She has lost the loving mother-son relationship that she and \n5 NATHAN PRASAD maintained, including regular contact, a warm relationship, and the \n6 assistance that NATHAN PRASAD regularly provided her, including home maintenance \n7 and improvement projects. \n8 75.  As NATHAN PRASAD’s young children, T.P. and A.P. have experienced \n9 the traumatic loss of their father, who remained close to them throughout their lives until \n10 his tragic death.  They have taken the loss of their father extremely hard, asking when they \n11 will be able to see him again.  They have had and will continue to have great difficulty \n12 coping with his death during their most formative years.  T.P. and A.P. have further \n13 suffered the loss of NATHAN PRASAD’s financial support, his care and supervision of \n14 them, and his paternal guidance. \n15\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n16 Cruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States – Deliberate Indifference to Serious \n17 Medical Needs, Health and Safety \n(Survival Action – 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n18 (Against Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, J. PAUL PARKER, DAVID SAMSON, \nNORMAN BIDWELL, DORIS BROWN, MELODY YOUNG, BALJINDER RAI, \n19 SHANE DICKSON, UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I, FREMONT-RIDEOUT \nHEALTH GROUP, DAVID FRATERS, and DOES I through XL) \n20  \n21 76.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 75 of \n22 this complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n23 77.  Defendants knew that NATHAN PRASAD was in danger of serious personal \n24 harm because: \n25 a.  Based on NATHAN PRASAD’s previous contact with COUNTY OF \n26 SUTTER and Sutter County Jail officers and employees, including all individual \n27 Defendants, Defendants had substantial documentation of his medical needs, and his need \n28 for consistent supervision and prompt medical attention when warranted. \n[579099-7]    17 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 19 of 59\n \n1 b.  NATHAN PRASAD completed and submitted multiple written \n2 requests to receive medical treatment, reporting “extreme pain,” a staph infection, and the \n3 need for “emergency” medical attention. \n4 c.  Emergency room physicians documented clear instructions that were \n5 placed in NATHAN PRASAD’s custody file and reviewed by Defendants, that if his \n6 symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed, he needed to be returned to the hospital \n7 for emergency treatment immediately.  Upon information and belief, Defendants \n8 PARKER, SAMSON, and BIDWELL were informed and aware of NATHAN PRASAD’s \n9 evaluation at Rideout Memorial Hospital and the discharge instructions providing that if \n10 his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed, he must be taken to the Emergency \n11 Department immediately.  Upon information and belief, Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, \n12 RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I each reviewed and/or were \n13 informed of NATHAN PRASAD’s custody file, including the medical documentation \n14 indicating his medical status and need to be taken to the emergency room immediately if \n15 his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed. \n16 d.  Defendants FREMONT-RIDEOUT HEALTH GROUP and \n17 FRATERS, who treated NATHAN PRASAD pursuant to a COUNTY OF SUTTER \n18 contractual agreement to provide medical treatment to Sutter County Jail inmates, \n19 discharged NATHAN PRASAD to a notoriously dangerous setting at Sutter County Jail on \n20 January 26, 2011.  They knew or should have known that NATHAN PRASAD had or \n21 could have had a serious and life-threatening condition and would need access to \n22 emergency medical treatment if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  \n23 Defendants further knew or should have known, and thus acted with deliberate \n24 indifference, to the known risk of serious or lethal injury to NATHAN PRASAD given \n25 that his safe discharge from the hospital depended on the capacity for timely emergency \n26 medical response, which they knew or should have known did not exist at Sutter County \n27 Jail, given the hospital’s service agreement and their experience treating Sutter County Jail \n28 inmates. \n[579099-7]    18 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 20 of 59\n \n1 e.  From January 26 to January 28, 2011, NATHAN PRASAD reported \n2 to each of Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL \n3 EMPLOYEE I that he was in extreme pain, having trouble breathing, and afraid that he \n4 was going to die. \n5 f.  Defendants BROWN, YOUNG, and RAI, each observed and \n6 documented that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were clearly getting \n7 worse, including but not limited to vomiting, shortness of breath, severe chills, coughing \n8 and/or vomiting up blood, and “uncontrollable pain.” \n9 g.  Defendants DICKSON and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I each \n10 observed that NATHAN PRASAD’s condition and symptoms were clearly getting worse, \n11 heard his and his fellow inmates’ pleas for medical help. \n12 h.  Inmates housed with NATHAN PRASAD collected the blood that \n13 NATHAN PRASAD was coughing up in an empty milk carton, showing it to Defendants \n14 BROWN, YOUNG, RAI, DICKSON, and UNKNOWN JAIL EMPLOYEE I in a \n15 desperate effort to obtain medical attention and treatment for him. \n16 i.  In the pre-dawn hours of January 28, 2011, Defendants RAI and \n17 YOUNG observed and documented NATHAN PRASAD’s significant suffering and life-\n18 threatening symptoms, including dangerously low blood pressure and blood-oxygen \n19 saturation, coughing and/or vomiting up blood, dizziness, sweats, and reports that \n20 NATHAN PRASAD feared that he was “going to die.” \n21 j.  Not until several hours after these observations and documented \n22 reports did Sutter County Jail staff contact emergency medical services and summon an \n23 ambulance.  At that time, NATHAN PRASAD’s condition had deteriorated so \n24 substantially that his condition was dire.  He died soon thereafter at the hospital. \n25 78.  Defendants failed to provide necessary evaluation and treatment for \n26 NATHAN PRASAD while he was detained at Sutter County Jail. \n27 79.  Defendants’ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n28 limited to their failure to provide NATHAN PRASAD with timely or adequate medical \n[579099-7]    19 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 21 of 59\n \n1 care and/or to take other measures to protect him from serious harm, along with the acts \n2 and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to train, supervise and/or promulgate \n3 appropriate policies and procedures at Sutter County Jail in order to prevent NATHAN \n4 PRASAD’s and other inmate deaths, constituted deliberate indifference to NATHAN \n5 PRASAD’s serious medical needs, health and safety. \n6 80.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, NATHAN \n7 PRASAD experienced physical pain, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of his \n8 life, and the damages alleged herein. \n9 81.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of the individually named \n10 Defendants were malicious, reckless and/or accomplished with a conscious disregard of \n11 decedent’s rights thereby entitling Plaintiffs to an award of exemplary and punitive \n12 damages according to proof, to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter \n13 such conduct in the future. \n14\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15 Municipal Liability for in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States  \n16 (Survival Action - 42 U.S.C. § 1983)  \n(Against Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER) \n17  \n18 82.

We were privileged to be selected a year ago to serve on \nthe Sutter County Grand Jury as “a voice of the people and conscience of the \ncommunity.” We took our work seriously and did our best to approach our reviews and \ninvestigations objectively and thoroughly.  \nIt has been a year of learning and hard work in gaining new insights; some were \nfrustrations, and some were fun. We have all had personal growth in this Grand Jury \nexperience. As is with any new Grand Jury, eighteen independent individuals with \ndistinctive talents and skills successfully formed cohesive efforts to make their \ncontribution to the citizens of this county. Members of this Jury have dedicated countless \nhours of work investigating, compiling, debating, and writing these reports. Each member \nof this Grand Jury contributed greatly to this report. I am proud of my fellow jurors and \nall they have accomplished. \nThis year was Judge Brian Aronson second year as the supervising judge for the Grand \nJury. We would like to thank Judge Aronson, together we have learned a lot. To complete \nour work, we had the assistance of the county's court staff, particularly Christine Dagnino \nand Jackie Laswell. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Our \nthanks to District Attorney Carl Adams and his staff who assisted us along the way taking \nour phone calls and providing us with the information we needed to perform our duties as \nmembers of the Grand Jury. We commend District Attorney Carl Adams dedication of \ntime as the legal advisor for the Grand Jury for the past twenty-eight years. The Court \nSecurity Staff was very helpful as we navigated unfamiliar territory around the \ncourthouse. Many individuals from the various agencies we visited were also helpful in \ncountless ways. \nIn Conclusion I would like to thank this year’s Grand Jurors for their conscientious effort \nand commitment. I would also like to thank Tammie Putman for her dedication and \nservice as the Pro-tem and Secretary of the 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury. Her \ndedication has made our job much easier. In closing, I would also like to express my \n  2 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 34 of 59\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 35 of 59\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 36 of 59\nTable of Contents \n                    Page \nAD-HOC Committee                 7 \nSutter County Jail Nurses Program Citizens Complaint       8 \n  Attachment A               12   \nAudit and Finance Committee             13 \n   \nMisallocation of Bradley-Burns and Transportation Tax Fund Deposits  14   \n    Attachment A               19 \n    Attachment B               20 \n    Attachment C               21 \nCounty Government and Administration Committee      22\n     \nCounty Government Release of Public Information        23 \nCriminal Justice Committee              26 \n                     \nLeo Chesney Community Correctional Facility        27 \nSutter County Jail                29 \nSutter County Department of Child Support Services      31 \nYuba City Police Department             34 \n   \nYuba-Sutter Juvenile Hall Camp Singer Youth Guidance Center    35 \n   \nEducation Committee                38 \n   \nSutter County Superintendent of Schools          39 \nSutter Union High School               43 \n   \nFire and Emergency Committee            45 \n  Office of Emergency Management             46 \nTwin Cities Rod and Gun Club            48 \n  5 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 37 of 59\nHealth and Mental Health Services Committee        50 \n   \nSutter-Yuba Mental Health Services           51 \n   \nPlanning and Environment Committee          54 \n   \nSutter County Environmental Health Division        55 \nSutter County Planning Services            57\nPublic Buildings and Properties Committee         58 \nSutter County Animal Control Shelter          59 \nSocial Services Committee              78 \nMaternal, Child and Adolescent Health Program        79\nSutter County Department of Human Services         81 \nContinuity Committee                84 \n   \nDepartment of Child Support Services          85 \nLeo Chesney Community Correctional Facility        86 \nSutter County Jail                 87 \nYuba City Police Department             88 \nYuba-Sutter Juvenile Hall              89 \n  6 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 38 of 59\nAD-HOC \nCommittee \n  7 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 39 of 59\nSutter County Jail Nurses Program \nCitizens Complaint \nIntroduction \nThe 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury (SCGJ) received a citizen's complaint on the \nSutter County Jail Nurses Program. The complaint alleged illegal practices, lack of \ntraining, out of compliant policies/procedures and poor inmate medical care. \nThe Grand Jury established an Adhoc Committee to undertake an investigation to \ndetermine these allegations on the complaint. Interviews were held with supervisors, \nmanagers, and staff of the Sutter County Jail. The Adhoc Committee completed an \ninvestigation of this complaint and made a number of recommendations resulting from \nthat investigation. \nDiscussion \nThe Sutter County Jail Nurses program is to ensure provision of emergency and basic \nhealth care services to individuals who are in custody. Nursing Staff provides health care \nto the incarcerated from booking until the time of release. Along with the Physician and \nNurse Practitioner, there is a Jail Nurse Manager, a Supervising Registered Nurse (SRN) , \nthree Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN)'s  and 7-8 contract LVN's. Since November \n2010, the county has an open position for a second SRN. \nThe Grand Jury felt the allegations in the complaint were serious and needed to be \ninvestigated. \nThe complaint alleges the following: \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nAccording to the complaint, per Legal Decree #CIV- S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P) of \nDempsey W. Haller, et al. vs. The County of Sutter, et al. (see attachment, A) states in \npart: \nE. 2. Staffing:  \"Jail medical staffing is the responsibility of the County's Human \nServices Department and shall consist of at least one registered nurse on site during either \nthe day shift or the evening shift seven days per week, and either one registered nurse or \none L VN on site during the other day shift or evening shift as appropriate, seven days per \nweek ... \" \nPrior to the resignation of a SRN, there was one SRN and LV  N on the day shift or one \nSRN and LV  N on the night shift. There was an incident when the SRN on the night shift \nbecame ill while on duty. The SRN called in a LV  N for backup. The SRN was \nreprimanded by the Jail Nurse Manager in an email that there should have been a \nRegistered Nurse on duty. The SRN was referred to legal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DFL \n8 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 40 of 59\nJFM (P) against Sutter County, which states the requirement. The SRN was not told of \nthis legal decree prior to this incident. According to the staff, there had been 20 days so \nfar that year that this had occurred. During the investigation, it was noted that this was a \ncommon occurrence since there were only two SRNs. \nLack of Training \nAccording to the complaint training of staff nurses has not occurred in more than five (5) \nyears. Annual onsite training is necessary to maintain proficiency in emergency response \nprocedures. \nBefore the SRN resigned, the SRN requested onsite training. The SRN's request was \nrefused by the Jail Nurse Manager. The SRN put together training on Emergency \nResponse in the jail. The SRN asked for a review ofthe materials and the Jail Nurse \nManager refused to even look at the class outline. The SRN held the class with a few \nnurses and correctional staff in attendance. \nOut of Compliant Policies and Procedures \nThe complaint alleged the Jail Nurses Program is out of compliance with California State \ncorrectional code - Title 15 sec 1206 Policy and Procedures (P&P) are to be reviewed \nannually. Standardized Nursing Procedures (SNP) have not been reviewed or updated \nsince 1995. The SNP has been changed with pencil marks. \nThe nursing staff has inquired as to why these P&P's and the SNP's are outdated. The \nJail Nursing Manager's answer is lack oftime prevents him from completing the task. \nFinding \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nThe Nurse staffing at the Jail has been directed by a court order in Dempsey W. Haller \nvs. Sutter County, et al. No. CIV -S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P). Failure to comply with this \norder Sutter County can be found out-of-compliance and could be liable for additional \naction by the Court. \nRecommendation \nEvery effort should be made to hire an additional SRN and ensure one is available for \neither the AM shift or the PM shift. The Nursing Program Manager needs to take a more \nactive role in managing the Jail Nursing Program. Once the SRN position is filled, the \nNursing Program Manager, who is also an RN, must be utilized to ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram is in compliance with the court order. \n9 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 41 of 59\nThe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should provide oversight to insure \nthe Jail Nursing Program is in full compliance with court order Legal decree #CIV -S-93-\n1256 DLF JFM (P). \nFinding \nLack of Training \nLegal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DLF JFM (P) \nE 19. Training: \"Jail custody staff shall receive periodic update training in First Aid, CPR, \nintake screening, blood borne pathogens and suicide prevention ... \" \nSutter County Jail Medical Policies and Procedures #3 Section 6. \"Oversees training of \nnurses and/or officers in areas where improvement is needed, as identified by QA audits, \nincluding regular and continued joint staff development activities. These will be \ndocumented as to date given, content, attendees and comments.\" \nTraining is necessary to maintain proficiency in on-site activities. The Nursing Program \nManager has failed to offer his nursing staff any of the required training. When one of his \nSRN's put together an emergency response training class he refused to review the course \noutline before the class was held. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends the Nursing Program Manager along with the Medical \nOfficer, develop a training program to ensure adequate on-site training be made available \nto the nursing staff on a regular basis. The Assistant Director of Health and Human \nServices should provide oversight to ensure this training program is implemented. \nFinding \nOut of Compliance Policies and Procedures \nTitle 15 Regulations 1206. Health Care Procedure Manual \"The health authority shall in \ncooperation with the facility administrator, set forth in writing, policies and procedures in \nconformance with applicable State and Federal law, which are reviewed and updated at \nleast annually ... \" \nDuring the investigation, it was stated unanimously that the P&P's were significantly out \nof-date. The County Medical Officer is responsible for making sure the P&P's are current \nby signing them annually. The Jail Nurse Program Manager has overall responsibility to \nsee that the Nursing Program policies and procedures are operational and functioning in \nthe scope as laid out in the Standard Nursing Procedures. The Jail Nurse Program \nManager has not done this. When the Jail Nurse Program Manager was hired, the P&P's \nwere not up to date. By not correcting these problems, his inaction has allowed this \n10 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 42 of 59\nsituation to deteriorate further. The Jail Nurse Program Manager indicated it would take \nover a year to complete. This should be made a priority. \nRecommendation \nThe County Medical Officer and the Jail Nurse Program Manager with oversight from \nthe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram P&P's are reviewed, rewritten, and made current so they can be used and \nreferred to by the jail staff. The Standard Nursing Procedures has been changed with \npencil marks and needs to be corrected. \nThe Grand Jury recommends that these documents be completed by December 31, 2011. \nThe Jail Nursing Program would also benefit from more active oversight by the Assistant \nDirector of Health and Human Services to see that it is accomplished by the above date. \nFinding \nDuring this investigation the Grand Jury finds the Jail Nursing Program is completely out \nof compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard nursing procedures. This \nexposes Sutter County to numerous potential issues in the future. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends that the Assistant Director of Health and Human Services \nactively take measures to ensure that this program is in full compliance with the law. It is \nunacceptable that the program is out of compliance, lack of training for the nursing staff, \nnot having the P & P's up-to-date, and the pencil corrections in the SNP. The Grand Jury \nrecommends that the Jail Nursing Program be in full compliance by December 31, 2011. \nRespondents \nDirector of Health and Human Services, Tom Sherry \nAssistant Director of Health and Human Services, Amerjit Bhattal \nCounty Medical Officer, Dr. Cummings \nJail Nurse Program Manager, Brent Garbett \n11 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 43 of 59\nAttachment A \n12 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD   Document 1   Filed 03/06/12   Page 44 of 59\n-\n- ..... \n\\  '_.
