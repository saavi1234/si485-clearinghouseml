    "summary": "<p>Two Occupy Wall Street protesters brought this suit on February 8, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the City of New York and the New York Police Department. During a 2011 demonstration, plaintiffs were pepper sprayed by highly-ranked police officer. Defendant officers further assaulted and detained the plaintiffs, all without a warrant or legal process. The plaintiffs brought this cause of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, as well as state civil rights law. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought monetary relief for physical pain and mental suffering due to the violations.</p><p>On May 21, 2014, the court related 9 other cases to this case for further proceedings. Two of these cases are in the Clearinghouse under <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13710\">Crisp v. The City of New York</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13708\"> Lawler v. City of New York </a>. On March 9, 2015, Judge Robert W. Sweet reassigned the case to Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger for general pretrial matters, including scheduling, discovery, and settlement.</p><p>On June 30, 2015, the parties reached a settlement and agreed to resolve the remaining issues raised in the complaint without further proceedings and without admitting any fault or liability. The court dismissed the claim with prejudice, but retained jurisdiction over the action to enforce the terms of the settlements between parties. </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/nyregion/new-york-city-reaches-settlements-for-6-pepper-sprayed-occupy-wall-street-protesters.html\">The New York Times</a>, the defendant paid a total of $332,500 in damages  (between $52,000 to $60,000 to each plaintiff). Additionally, the New York Times reports that the NYPD released a statement saying that the NYPD has not altered its pepper spray guidelines.</p>",

They were forced to endure pain and suffering, all to their \ndetriment. \nAS AND FOR A FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n29. Plaintiffs repeat each and every allegation in this Complaint as though fully set \nforth at length herein. \n30. Defendant city ofNew York has grossly failed to train and adequately supervise \nits police officers in the fundamental law of arrest, assault and battery, search and \nseizure, excessive force, especially when its officers are not in possession of a \ncourt authorized arrest warrant and where an individual, especially as here, has not \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00992-RWS   Document 1   Filed 02/08/12   Page 6 of 7\ncommitted a crime and has not resisted arrest, that its police officers should only \nuse reasonable force to effectuate an arrest and the arrest should be on probable \ncause. \n31. The City of New York was negligent by failing to implement a policy with its \npolice department and instruct police officers who, absent the consent of Plaintiffs \n(or similarly situated individuals) or without the possession of a court authorized \narrest or search warrant, said police officers of the City of New York are not to \narrest individuals such as Plaintiff here, where probable cause is lacking and the \nuse of force should only be reasonable when an individual resists arrest and should \nnot be used where a criminal defendant or suspect is not resisting arrest. \n32. The City ofNew York is negligent due to its failure to implement a policy with its \nPolice Department or actively enforce the law, if any of the following are lacking: \nA. Probable cause must be present before an individual such as the Plaintiff herein \ncan be arrested. \nB.  Force cannot be used against an individual who does not physically resist \narrest. \nC.  A person may not be assaulted or touch in any way when legally exercising \ntheir rights. \n33. The foregoing acts, omissions and systematic failures are customs and policies of \nthe City of New York which caused the police officers to falsely arrest, \nmaliciously prosecute, seize illegally and search the Plaintiffs and commit an \nassault/battery to their persons. \nAS AND FOR A SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n34. Plaintiffs repeat each and every allegation in this Complaint as though fully set \nforth at length herein. \n35. Defendant City of New York was negligent in that prior to and at the time of the \nacts complained herein, due to the prior history of the Police Officer Defendants, \nknew or should have known the bad disposition of said Defendant officers and \ndefendants had knowledge of facts that would put a reasonably prudent employer \non inquiry concerning their bad disposition and the fact that these officers were \nnot suitable to be hired and employed by the City of New York and that due to \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00992-RWS   Document 1   Filed 02/08/12   Page 7 of 7\ntheir lack of training, these officers should have had adequate supervision so that \nthey would not arrest innocent individuals nor use excessive force during the arrest \nprocess. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment against the Defendants, together with the \ncosts and disbursements of this action, together with attorney's fees and costs of bringing \nthis case and punitive damages. \nPlaintiffs hereby demands a  ury trial on \nDated:  February 8, 2012 \n-~,-a· : Aymen@Aboushi.com \nwww.Aboushi.com \n6 ",
