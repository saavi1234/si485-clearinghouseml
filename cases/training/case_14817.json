In particular,\n1. In recent years we -have developed an objec-\ntive system for associating the buyer's income and\ncash to tile mortgage market. This system was designed\nto realce to a mini-.7,um the subjectivity of the sales-\nman when he selects or assigns a mortgage program to\nthe buyer and to make it possible toserve the low\nincome and. .low down payment buyer.\nThe elements, that are used. to make this objective\nassociation possible cons 1st:an elaborate computer\nprogralc:rned(cid:9) cdlcolL titnivolvinL, ax ratE,s,\ntransfer costs, down payment and other mortgage service\ncosts for each tax authority in the Greater Baltimore\narea. In addition we have developed a form that is\nused to interrogate the buyer -so as toestablish in\n-an. optimum manner his effective income and total\navailab l e cash. This information is applied to the\nabove mentioned mortgage calculator. The computer.\nis programmed to assist cash limited buyers in\n0\ngatherin;, inforr:ation necessary to make complicated\nfinancial arranc;cments such as those for low down\n\nvtym,:i1c. loins -insured by the Federal HoOsing\nAdministrati,)n.\n9 . We have develoDed an objective system\nfor associatiilg . the .buver's domesti c needs to the\n• listing ;-,;arkc:t. :This consists of developing and\npatentin of a'maChine capable of revewing the\nentire Balt- imor.e market area in a matter of minutes\nfor any conceivable domestic need that the buyer\ncould recluest.\nTo make this system more objective we developed\nwhat we call the ABC form which provides for an orderly\nintervic of the buyer so that he may pronounce\nexpress hs desires in area, bedrooms, cost, design\nand extras.\n3. To  , Qe Nan=1YemPnf's desires that all\nir.11 )n  \nour buyers be treated in the. fairest manner possible\nwe have developed and operate an: auditing system\nwhich involvesa seven day callback for every buyer\nwho walks into the office br makes inquiry regarding\nproperties to salesmen on floor duty at each or our\nfour sales offices. The results of this system have\ngiven us a very close insight into the functions,\n•\npressures and problems of the salesman and of the\nbuyer. An additional function of our audit system\nrequires the auditor to contact our local offices so\n•\nas to determine for Management the degree of objectivity\nthat we are obtaining. at a result of 'our systems.\n•\nExtens:iv,?. records 1=c, been kept on this.\n\n4. .We maintain an e•tensiVe educational.\npro2;ram . that. is performed on a Continuing basis for\nall of. the sales Dersonnel.at this office.

The records of. this firm indicate that we\ndo approximately 17 percent of all the business done\nthrough Multiple List in .the Baltimore metropolitan\narea. To our knowledge we are the largest firm in\n\nthe area , and we are the .only firm whose business\nrerescnt-s(cid:9) than 5 percent of the total\n; pl7c-;st... on the market presently. employin black\ns.alesmen. -\nWe have hired black employees, both as salaried\nand as sal es staff.
