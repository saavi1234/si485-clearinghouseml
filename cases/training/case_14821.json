The Hinds County School Board, which had once refused to approve the Clinton MSSD, did approve the \nnew district “insofar as this Board is authorized to do” on May 14, 1970. \n \n4  Residents of the annexed area challenged the annexation, alleging that they were denied equal protection because \n  they were not allowed to vote on the annexation. The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected that challenge in Lowe v. \nCity of Jackson, 336 So.2d 490 (Miss.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 980, 97 S.Ct. 493, 50 L.Ed.2d 589 (1976).

No challenge has been made to the effect of \nthis annexation on the Hinds County SD. \n \n5  The county-wide system had a racial composition of 34% white and 66% Negro. Emporia would have established a \n  system that was 48% white and 52% Negro, leaving the remainder of the county 28% white and 72% Negro. When \nClinton MSSD was part of the Hinds County SD the composition was 45% white and 55% Negro. Clinton MSSD’s \ndeparture left the county SD 32% white and 68% Negro, while the Clinton MSSD was 85% white and 15% Negro. \nThose statistics were for seven academic years ago. Current estimates of the Hinds County SD (less the area recently \nannexed by the City of Jackson) show a composition of 18% white and 82% Negro. If the Clinton MSSD were part of \nthe Hinds County SD, the ratio would be 43% white and 57% Negro. \n \n6  The district court was correct in its ruling that the timing of the Clinton MSSD’s separation could not be used to \n  establish an impermissible motive. Indeed, our ruling assumes that the motives of the Clinton MSSD are free from \nany taint. The question is not one of motive but of effect. \n \n7  The “proper role” (see Stout v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 466 F.2d 1213, 1214 (5th Cir. 1972)) for Clinton MSSD \n  in the desegregation of Hinds County SD is not an all-or-nothing matter. For example, it may be found best for it to \nassimilate Lovett and Sumner Hill into its system, or to pair some of its schools with these schools in preference to \noutright dissolution and assimilation by Hinds County SD. Other viable alternatives may be suggested by the parties. \nThe judgment as to which is best is assigned initially to the district court. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 \n ",
