    "summary": "<p>On August 30, 2006, a group of ten children in the Nevada foster system, seeking class action certification for all children in or at risk of entering the Clark County, NV foster system, filed this class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. The plaintiffs filed under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), the Child the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), the Medicaid Act, and state law.  The plaintiffs sued a number of parties, including the state of Nevada, the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, the Nevada Bureau of Services for Child Care of the Division of Child and Family Services, the Clark County Department of Family Services, the Clark County Board of County Commissioners, and Clark County. </p><p>The plaintiffs, represented by the National Center for Youth Law and private counsel, asked the court to declare that the defendants had not met their obligations to children in the Clark County foster system, issue a permanent injunction against the foster system, provide for remedial relief to ensure that the defendants complied with their legal obligations toward foster children in the future, and award attorneys fees. </p><p>Under federal law, the plaintiffs alleged that Nevada had not placed children in quality placements that comply with national standards, had not provided safe settings that were most family-like, and had not provided adequate health and education records to foster parents or providers at the time of placement. The plaintiffs further alleged that Nevada violated CAPTA by not providing each abused or neglected child with a guardian ad litem in judicial proceedings, and violated the Medicaid Act by failing to provide mandatory Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment services so children would be diagnosed with health conditions and receive necessary treatment.</p><p>The plaintiffs further alleged that the Clark County foster system had violated substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment regarding protection from harm while in government custody, right to living environments that protect safety, and other causes. Major causes of action under state law included placing children for extended periods of time in a group facility that was overcrowded and unlicensed, leaving children in dangerous placements with inadequate supervision, and putting children back in homes where they had been harmed.</p><p>On September 29, 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Division of Child and Family Services filed a motion to dismiss. On December 11, 2006, the governor of Arizona also filed a motion to dismiss. On January 3, 2007, the Clark County defendants also filed a motion to dismiss. </p><p>On May 14, 2007, the District Court (Judge Robert C. Jones) granted the governor's motion to dismiss and dismissed the State of Nevada and the Department of Family Services from the action. The court held that there was not enough of a connection between the office of the Governor and the harms to foster children, so the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the Governor as the representative of the State of Nevada. The court denied the motion to dismiss by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Division of Child and Family Services. The court also granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by the Clark County defendants. The order upheld the plaintiffs' federal claims based on The Federal Adoption Assistance Act with respect to timely case plans, health and educational records, and notice of hearings, CAPTA with respect to providing guardians ad litem, screening and treatment requirements of the Medicaid Act. The court also deferred ruling on class certification. 2007 WL 1435428.</p><p>On June 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint seeking class action certification on behalf of children in or at risk of entering the Clark County foster system against the above-named parties, excluding the governor, State of Nevada, and Department of Family Services. The plaintiffs alleged violations under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, CAPTA, the Medicaid Act, and state law, and asked for declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>On September 4, 2007, Judge Jones granted defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under § 1983 that Nevada had failed to enforce state statutes providing for the plaintiff's welfare, noting that even if state law says a service is mandatory, that is not a constitutionally protected interest. Judge Jones also dismissed plaintiff's claim that by failing to follow to its state plan under CAPTA and the Adoption Assistance Act, the state programs using federal funding breached a contract with the federal government. The court noted that while plaintiffs may be third-party beneficiaries to the state plan agreement, they have failed to establish that agreements are contracts. 616 F. Supp. 2d 1038.</p><p>On March 12, 2008, Judge Robert Johnston, the magistrate judge, ordered the defendants  to disclose plaintiffs' foster system case files to plaintiffs' attorneys for the purposes of the trial. The court required the parties to enter a protective order to maintain the privacy of the case file information, and determined that the county was not required to provide documents that were not in its possession as part of discovery. </p><p>On March 28, 2008, the plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification. On July 10, 2008, Judge Jones issued an order dismissing the motion, which said that the plaintiffs had enough members to make a class (numerosity), but did not show enough commonality of interest, typicality of plaintiff type, or meet the adequacy of representation requirement by showing sufficient evidence of a pattern or practice of systemwide violations. The plaintiffs appealed this decision on class certification to the Ninth Circuit. </p><p>On October 24, 2008, Judge Jones denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge's order allowing discovery to include non-privileged information in the case files of children who have been abused, neglected, or died while in custody of Clark County. Judge Jones stated that this information was appropriate for the plaintiffs to have in the process of trying to certify the class.</p><p>On October 27, 2009, the parties jointly moved for dismissal with prejudice and withdrew all motions and appeals, including the pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit for class certification. The plaintiffs and defendants agreed each would pay its own attorney fees and costs. The foster children plaintiffs had all aged out of the system or were adopted. This has been a challenge for attempts to reform the foster system in Nevada through litigation, as cases are often challenged by lengthy delays in proceedings.</p>",

Las \n4  Vegas Blvd., Las Vegas, NV 89101, in the courtroom of Judge Robert C. Jones, plaintiffs will \n5  move the Court to issue an order as follows:  Certifying that this action is maintainable as a class \n6  action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2); certifying the class of persons \n7  described in plaintiffs’ complaint as the plaintiff class; designating the individual named plaintiffs \n8  as representatives of the plaintiff class and their counsel of record as attorneys for the plaintiff \n9  class; and declining to require plaintiffs to provide notice to absent class members prior to \n10  judgment. \n11  This motion will be made upon the grounds that, pursuant to Fed.

INTRODUCTION \n3  Plaintiffs are abused and neglected children taken from their parents and placed in \n4  Defendants’ custody.  Unfortunately, the foster care system that is supposed to nurture and \n5  protect them often causes them further harm; in the worst cases, even death.  It is a system that \n6  Tom Morton, the Director of the Clark County Department of Family Services (“DFS”), describes \n7  as a “crippled child welfare system,” and that has been “designated by Federal officials as the \n8  ‘worst child welfare system’ in the nation.”  Director Morton himself has admitted “it is probably \n9  somewhat of a miracle that more tragedies have not occurred.” 1   \n10  In order to remedy this dangerous situation, plaintiff foster children bring this class action \n11  suit on behalf of “children who have been, are, or will be victims of child abuse and neglect and \n12  have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of Clark County DFS.”  Second Amended \n13  Complaint (“SAC”) at 11 (Docket No. 142-1).  They seek to enforce their rights under federal and \n14  state law to have their most basic of needs met – safety, health, and stability.   \n15  A party seeking certification must show that:  (1) the proposed class is so numerous that \n16  joining all members individually is impractical (“numerosity”); (2) the class shares at least one \n17  common question of fact or law (“commonality”); (3) the class representatives’ claims are typical \n18  of the class (“typicality”); and (4) the named plaintiffs will fairly protect the interests of the class \n19  (“adequacy of representation”).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Hanlon v. Chrysler, 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 \n20  (9th Cir. 1998); Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  Plaintiffs must \n21  also satisfy one of the Rule 23(b) requirements.  In this case, plaintiffs seek to proceed under Rule \n22  23(b)(2), requiring a showing that the opposing party “has acted or refused on act on grounds \n23  generally applicable to the class,” making injunctive relief for the class as a whole appropriate.   \n24  The Court has already ruled that plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity requirement of \n25  Rule 23(a)(1).  May 14, 2007 Order at 44 (Docket No. 134).  The Court deferred ruling on the \n                                                 \n26 \n1 Director Morton made these statements in his “Report to U.S. Representative Shelley Berkley On The State of \n27  Clark County Department of Family Services” (submitted May 2007) (“Morton Report to Rep. Berkley”) at 8 & 17,  \nEx. D.  All Exhibits referenced herein are attached to the Declaration of William Grimm in Support of Plaintiffs’ \n28  Renewed Motion for Class Certification (“Grimm Decl.”) unless otherwise stated.   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor     \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 9 of 47\n \n1  remaining requirements until further discovery “specific to the proposed class” was conducted.  \n2  Id. at 44-47.   \n3  Multiple sources of information summarized herein provide overwhelming evidence that \n4  the harms suffered by the named plaintiffs are common and typical of those experienced by the \n5  class of foster children as a whole.  Importantly, the vast majority of the evidence comes from \n6  Defendants themselves: their own words or the words of their agents, reports and evaluations they \n7  have commissioned, and data they maintain.  The evidence leaves no question that the \n8  experiences of the named plaintiffs are merely the tip of the iceberg.  In Clark County, all foster \n9  children are at risk of harm in a dysfunctional system that operates with dysfunctional practices.   \n10  This renewed motion demonstrates that the class satisfies the requirements of \n11  commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  Plaintiffs also show that certification \n12  under 23(b)(2) is appropriate and necessary.  To ensure that all Clark County foster children \n13  receive the care and protection to which they are entitled, plaintiffs respectfully request that the \n14  Court grant their Renewed Motion for Class Certification. \n15  II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY & LEGAL BACKGROUND \n16  On August 30, 2006, plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in this action.  (Docket No. 1). \n17  Shortly thereafter, on October 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint.  (Docket No. \n18  57).  Plaintiffs have asserted the majority of their legal claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \n19  seeking to enforce their statutory and constitutional rights.  All claims are brought on behalf of \n20  the class as a whole.   \n21  Plaintiffs first moved to certify their class on November 21, 2006.  (Docket No. 74).  On \n22  May 14, 2007, this Court ruled that plaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(a)(1)’s “numerosity” requirement.  \n23  (Docket No. 134).  However, the Court deferred consideration of the remaining certification \n24  requirements until the parties had “an opportunity to conduct discovery specific to the proposed \n25  class.”  (Id. at 45-47).  In accordance with this directive, plaintiffs have conducted discovery, \n26  including propounding requests for production and interrogatories, conducting depositions, and \n27  issuing third-party subpoenas. 2  Grimm Decl. at ¶ 10.   \n                                                 \n28  2 County Defendants’ insufficient response to plaintiffs’ document discovery requests – including requests relevant to \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 2 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 10 of 47\n \n1  In its May 14, 2007 Order, the Court also ruled on Defendants’ motions to dismiss, \n2  upholding the majority of plaintiffs’ claims.3  (Docket No. 134).  Following this ruling, plaintiffs \n3  filed a Second Amended Complaint to address the Court’s concerns.  (Docket No. 142-1).  \n4  Currently, plaintiffs’ action includes claims based on substantive due process, the Federal \n5  Adoption Assistance Act, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Medicaid Act.   \n6  III.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n7  The tragic histories of the named plaintiffs illustrate the numerous harms suffered by \n8  foster children in Clark County: the death of baby Jerome A. in a foster home, the physical abuse \n9  and neglect suffered by his surviving siblings while in foster care, the denial of adequate health \n10  care for Donna C. and Clark K., and the many placement changes experienced by Summer and \n11  Frank B., are but a few examples.  With this motion, plaintiffs present overwhelming evidence \n12  that these injuries are sadly not the exception, but the norm.  Furthermore, the facts presented \n13  below show that these harms do not result from isolated or unusual causes; they are the inevitable \n14  result of system-wide deficiencies affecting all class members. \n15  Numerous sources corroborate the systemic failures in Clark County.  Significantly, some \n16  of the most powerful evidence comes from the State and County Defendants themselves, \n17  including: the agencies’ own records, admissions of current and former senior administrators, and \n18  reports and evaluations which Defendants themselves conducted or commissioned.  The \n19  following three sources alone provide a wealth of information from Defendants and professionals \n20  they have hired to examine the Clark County child welfare system: \n21  •  Independent Child Welfare Consultant Edward Cotton’s Report of Data Analysis, \nFindings and Recommendations presents troubling findings based on an extensive \n22  review of all cases (1,352) involving families with at least one child under the age \nof five who was currently a ward of Clark County.  (“Cotton Report”, Ex. E). \n23                                                                                                                                                                 \nthis Motion – forced plaintiffs to move to compel further production.  (Docket No. 156).  Plaintiffs’ Motion to \n24 \nCompel was recently granted, as was Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order.  (Docket Nos. 186 & 187).  Those \nOrders were filed on March 12, 2008, and the information Defendants are compelled to produce has not yet been \n25 \nprovided.  Grimm Decl. at ¶11.  In an effort to further delay production of crucial documents, County Defendants \nhave recently filed a motion for reconsideration of these orders, which is pending before this Court.  (Docket No. \n26 \n192).  However, even without this information, Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion is supported by more than sufficient \nevidence.  Grimm Decl. at ¶11.  \n27 \n3 Subsequently, the Court ruled upon a second motion to dismiss from State Defendants. September 4, 2007 Order at \n28  9-10 (Docket No. 161). \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 3 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 11 of 47\n \n1  •  Director Morton’s Report to U.S. Representative Shelley Berkley on the State of \nClark County Department of Family Services describes a myriad of problems with \n2  Clark County’s child welfare system.  (“Morton Report to Rep. Berkley”, Ex. D).4 \n3  •  Independent Consultant Missouri Alliance for Children and Families’ Report to \nClark County Nevada DFS, Out of Home Care Resources and Practices, \n4  (submitted August 2007) evaluates Clark County DFS’s out-of-home care program \nand provides recommendations based on intensive site visits.  (“Missouri Alliance \n5  Report”, Ex. F).   \n6  These and countless other sources underscore the inescapable fact that the Clark County \n7  foster care system is miserably failing the children placed in its care.  Without significant \n8  changes, every child in the custody of Clark County DFS goes from one day to the next, at risk of \n9  becoming the next tragedy. \nA.  All Children in Foster Care in Clark County Are Being Harmed or Exposed \n10 \nto a Substantial Risk of Harm.   \n11 \n12  Child welfare systems exist for the express purpose of protecting children from harm.  \n13  However, in Clark County, foster children suffer a wide spectrum of injuries while in Defendants’ \n14  custody – from physical abuse and neglect, to denial of medical care and mental health services, \n15  to lack of a permanent place to call home.  In the most tragic cases, children have died while in \n16  Defendants’ care.  The evidence presented below proves that it is not just the named plaintiffs \n17  who have been injured while in the custody of DFS; all class members are exposed to and at risk \n18  of suffering harm. \n19  1.  Foster Children in Clark County Are Dying From Abuse and Neglect.  \n20  The deaths of children in foster care are the most tragic results of a broken system.  In \n21  Clark County, there are simply far too many preventable child deaths occurring on Defendants’ \n22  watch.   \n23  Jerome A., the baby brother of named plaintiffs Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King \n24  (“the A. children”) died while in foster care at the age of 14 months.  Declaration of Tarrah Logan \n25  (“Logan Decl.”) at ¶ 13 (Docket No. 82).  Jerome was scalded to death in a DFS-licensed foster \n26  home when the foster mother left him and his siblings alone at night without adult supervision.  \n27 \n                                                 \n28  4 Much of Defendant Morton’s report to Congresswoman Berkley relies upon the findings of the Cotton Report.  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 4 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 12 of 47\n \n1  Id. at ¶¶ 10, 12-13.  Several of his siblings witnessed his death.  Id. at ¶ 13.  For months before \n2  Jerome’s death, DFS ignored numerous reports of abuse and neglect in the foster home, as well as \n3  the foster mother’s pleas to have the children removed.  (Logan Decl. at ¶¶ 9-12 (Docket No. 82); \n4  Deposition of Tarrah Logan (“Logan Dep.”) at 121:22 –122:5, 123:2 – 125:25).  Disturbingly, the \n5  many problems that existed in that home exist in countless other homes in Clark County.  See \n6  generally infra Part III.B.  \n7  According to information provided by County Defendants themselves, a shocking number \n8  of children have died while in the care and custody of DFS in the last seven years.  (Clark County \n9  DFS: Child Fatality and Open DFS Cases, 2000 to Present, Ex. G).  The data demonstrates that \n10  the deaths of children with open DFS cases have been steadily increasing over the past four years: \n11  3 deaths in 2003, 7 deaths in 2004, 12 deaths in 2005, 15 deaths in 2006, and 12 deaths in just the \n12  first half of 2007.  (Id.). 5 \n13  The circumstances of the following individual cases reveal how systemic deficiencies \n14  contribute to the disappearance and deaths of foster children: \n15  •  Two-year-old Everlyse Cabrera disappeared from a foster home on June 10, 2006.  \nA subsequent  investigation found that DFS ignored indicators that the foster home \n16  was unsafe, failed to visit children placed in the home, and failed to investigate \nreports of suspected child abuse in the home, among other dangerous practices.  \n17  (Case Review: Manual and Vhee Carrascal Foster Home (June 29, 2006), Ex. H; \nSee also Complaint, Cabrera v. Balane, No. CV-1285 (JCU) (D. Nev. October 12, \n18  2006)).  \n19  •  One-year-old Joshua Sharp died at Child Haven, County Defendants’ shelter for \nchildren entering foster care, in August 2006.  Joshua entered Child Haven in June \n20  2006 in relatively good health but died there two months later of a severe ear \ninfection that was known to DFS staff but went untreated.  An investigation \n21  conducted by State Defendants uncovered numerous violations of policies and \npractices that clearly contributed to his death, including failing to obtain medical \n22 \n                                                 \n23  5 The County document provided through discovery does not include any information about the causes of death of \nthese children who died with open DFS cases.  Grimm Decl. at ¶ 16.  Defendants are required to make certain \n24  information about child fatalities available pursuant to the public disclosure requirements of the federal Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act of 1974.  Significantly, many of the deaths listed in the County’s document are not \n25  included in Child Welfare Agency Public Disclosure forms for Clark County available on the State’s website. (See \nhttp://dcfs.state.nv.us/DCFS_ChildFatalities_Disclosures_Clark.htm (last visited 3/11/08); see also Grimm Decl. at \n26  ¶17).   For example, just between January 1 and May 3, 2007, 12 children died in the care and custody of County \nDefendants, according to their own document.  However, only seven of these deaths are reported on the State’s \n27  website.  Even if DFS has an explanation for their failure to report these five “missing” deaths to the State, the fact \nremains that more children are dying while in Clark County DFS custody than is publicly known, and very little is \n28  known about the circumstances of their deaths.

I).6  \n3  •  Seven-month-old Baby Boy Charles died in a foster home in October 2006 from \nblunt force trauma to the head resulting in a fatal skull fracture and other injuries.  \n4  His foster mother was arrested and charged with murder by child abuse.  Baby Boy \nCharles did not receive the required visits from his caseworker prior to his death, \n5  and the foster home was overloaded with children.  (See Declaration of \nWarrant/Summons of Holly LeBergen (No. 060802-2003) at 2 & 4, Ex. J; First \n6  Amended Complaint, Charles and Prum v. Ochs, No. CV-1212 (RLH) (D. Nev. \nFebruary 1, 2008)).7   \n7 \n•  Two-year-old Zander Martino died just eight months ago, after DFS returned him \n8  to his father despite repeated previous instances of severe physical abuse, \nincluding a fractured skull and multiple other broken bones.  A coroner’s autopsy \n9  concluded that Zander’s death was a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the \nabdomen.  Zander’s sister told a DFS investigator “Dad hit Zander with a hammer \n10  last night.”  This occurred just 12 days after DFS decided to return Zander to his \nfather.  It is unclear what sort of safety assessment, if any, was completed prior to \n11  this placement.  (See Declaration of Warrant/Summons of Lisa Myk (No.070710-\n0859) at 2, Ex. K; See also Child Welfare Agency Public Disclosure Form, dated \n12  8/8/07, Ex. L).  \n13  Defendants’ poor practices, including failing to visit children and failing to conduct abuse \n14  investigations, contributed to the deaths of these children.  Until the systemic problems leading to \n15  these and other deaths are addressed, all children in foster care are at risk.   \n16  2.  DFS Puts Children at Risk of Abuse and Neglect While in Foster Care. \n17  Although foster care should be a safe haven, many children are instead further abused and \n18  neglected while in Clark County’s custody.  This mistreatment compounds the already grave and \n19  long term effects of child abuse and neglect.8   \n                                                 \n20  6 Ms. Swain, DFS Division Manager at the time, confirmed that Child Haven’s file for Joshua contained little \ninformation other than an entry that his temperature had been taken a couple of weeks before his death.  (Swain Dep. \n21 \nat 88:3-89:4; 94:1-6, Ex. UU).  She was fired by Defendant Morton two days after Joshua’s death, after receiving an \ne-mail from Defendant Morton asking “[h]ow am I going to explain this [Joshua’s death] to the National Center for \n22 \nYouth Law.”  (Id. at 85:10-86:14).  Ms. Swain also testified about the death of another infant who had been placed by \nCounty Defendants in an emergency shelter foster parent home.  (Id. at 103:15-105:3). \n23 \n7 In addition to this and the Cabrera suit cited above, several other suits are pending on behalf of the estates of \n24  children who died in foster care with County Defendants.  See, e.g., Complaint, Lewis v. State of Nevada, No. CV-\n1109 (KJD) (D. Nev. August 21, 2007) (four month old infant died from suffocation in a foster home that had four \n25  foster children under the age of 19 months in violation of State law; foster parents failed to supervise the care of the \nfoster children); Complaint, Garcia v. Clark County, No. CV-1507 (RCJ) (D. Nev. November 12, 2007); Complaint, \n26  Ruttenbur v. Jackson, No. CV-1382 (RCJ) (D. Nev.

(See Logan Decl. at ¶¶ 10, 14 (Docket No. 82); Logan Dep. at 50:11 – 52:19, \n5  113:19 – 114:16, 110:16 – 111:21, Ex. TT; Swain Dep. at 110-111, Ex. UU (“… the same \n6  scenario happened twice, except the second time, obviously, there wasn’t a death.”)).  In fact, \n7  none of the named plaintiffs was spared the experience of abuse or neglect while in Defendants’ \n8  custody.  (See Declaration of Marilyn Paikai (“Paikai Decl.

Decl.”) at ¶¶ 14, 17-19 (Docket No. 78) (severe \n11  neglect); Declaration of Jacquelyn Romero (“Romero Decl.”) at ¶¶ 6-9 (Docket No. 80) (severe \n12  neglect and emotional abuse)).   \n13  Defendants’ own documents reveal that abuse and neglect while in Defendants’ custody is \n14  a widespread problem.  For example, Clark County’s foster home licensing documents reflect an \n15  alarming number of license revocations, suspensions, and denials,9 which in turn reveal that foster \n16  children are suffering wide-ranging abuse and neglect in the very foster homes in which they are \n17  placed for their safety.  These documents provide evidence that children are sexually assaulted in \n18  foster homes (CC-DRSFHL 0166), brutally restrained by foster parents (CC-DRSFHL 0243), \n19  severely physically abused by foster parents (CC-DRSFHL 0046, 0075, 0156, 0171, 0148), \n20  medically neglected by foster parents (CC-DRSFHL 0119, 0037-38), and left alone in dangerous \n21  situations or with foster parents under the influence of illegal drugs (CC-DRSFHL 0020-21, \n22  0029-30, 0041-42, 0095-96).10  These examples are but a small sample of the numerous instances \n23 \n                                                                                                                                                               \n24 \nsuggests that abuse and neglect are associated with both short- and long-term negative consequences for children’s \n25  physical and mental health, cognitive skills and educational attainment, and social and behavioral development.”) \n9 The documents provided by Defendants do not appear to include all homes in which abuse/neglect occurred.  For \n26 \nexample, there was no revocation or suspension notice for Melanie Ochs, who was arrested in October 2006 and \ncharged with the murder of a child in her foster home.  See supra Part III.A.1., for further description of the case. \n27 \n10 All documents labeled CC-DRSFHL – Clark County DFS Notices of Revocation, Notices of Suspension, and \n28  Denials of License Renewal – were produced by County Defendants, and are attached to the Grimm Decl. as Ex.

These reports \n4  also document the ugly fact that the incidence of abuse and neglect while in foster care has been \n5  steadily increasing since 2004.13  (Clark County Institutional Abuse Reports, Ex. P).  Foster \n6  children have been subjected to all types of abuse and neglect – sexual abuse, physical \n7  abuse/beating, emotional abuse, neglect, lack of supervision, medical neglect, and failure to \n8  provide basic necessities.   \n9  Moreover, these reports do not capture the magnitude of abuse and neglect suffered by \n10  foster children in Clark County.  First, studies and surveys provide considerable evidence that the \n11  actual incidence of maltreatment of foster children exceeds the number that is officially reported \n12  and investigated.14  Second, these reports only record instances in which a formal report of abuse \n13  or neglect in a licensed placement is called in and accepted for investigation.  (DFS Reporting \n14  Module User Manual  at 64, Ex. O).  They exclude allegations against DFS staff, any complaint \n15  that is not viewed as reaching a “criminal level,”15 and perhaps most concerning, any reports of \n16  abuse and neglect of the thousand-plus children in unlicensed homes (e.g. with family or “fictive \n17  kin”).16 \n18  As described above, Defendants’ own documents establish that that the abuse and neglect \n19                                                   \n11 County Defendants have produced over 400 pages of licensing revocation, suspension, and denial notices.  Grimm \n20 \nDecl at ¶ 23.  \n21  12 Institutional Abuse Reports generated by Clark County provide a list of licensed foster care providers who have \nbeen the subject of an allegation of abuse and neglect of a child in foster care. (DFS Reporting Module User Manual \n22  at 64, Ex. O). \n13 For calendar year 2004, Institutional Abuse Reports were 73 pages, increasing to 90 pages for 2005, 104 pages for \n23 \n2006, and 28 pages for just the first quarter of 2007.   \n24  14 See Casey Family Programs Foster Care Alumni Study Improving Family Foster Care: Findings from the \nNorthwest Foster Care Alumni Study (“Casey Alumni Study”) (Rev. 2004), at 30-31, Ex. Q. \n25  15 The Institutional Abuse Team Meeting Minutes note that: “Currently, all complaints on Child Haven are being \nscreened through LVMPD [Las Vegas Metro Police Dep’t].  If it does not reach criminal level, it is not investigated; \n26 \neven if 432B [child protective services statute] has been violated.” (2/26/2007 Inst. Abuse Meeting Minutes at 2, \nEx. R).  \n27 \n16 From data provided by Defendants, it appears that well over 1,000 children are placed in unlicensed relative \n28  placements.

Foster \n2  children in Clark County remain at risk even in the foster homes designed to protect them.   \n3  3.  Defendants Fail to Provide Much-Needed Medical Care and Mental \nHealth Services to Foster Children in Clark County.   \n4 \n5  Defendants fail to provide Clark County foster children with medically necessary health \n6  and mental health services, compounding the harm caused by their maltreatment.  Given that high \n7  percentages of children entering foster care have significant medical and mental health needs17, \n8  timely access to services is critical.  (See 6/6/06 Presentation to Clark County Board of County \n9  Commissioners on Family Services at 7, Ex. U).  At the most basic level, children need initial \n10  health screenings in the first days of placement to identify the need for immediate medical or \n11  mental health care.  On an ongoing basis, foster children, like all children, need regular medical \n12  and dental examinations, developmental and mental health screenings, and any necessary \n13  therapeutic and treatment services.  All too often in Clark County, health screenings are not \n14  performed and medically necessary services are not delivered.   \n15  a.  Denial of Mental Health Services \n16  Defendants regularly fail to provide foster children with needed mental health assessments \n17  and services.  Moreover, the quality of the mental health services that are provided is often poor.  \n18  The named plaintiffs’ experiences illustrate the lack of adequate mental health care \n19  provided to the class as a whole.  Despite their need for wide-ranging mental health services, the \n20  named plaintiffs have been subjected to harmful delays in the provision of needed assessments \n21  and services, if not an outright denial of such care.  For example, although Donna C. had been \n22  severely emotionally abused, neglected, and traumatized, she was not assessed or provided with \n23  any form of therapy for nearly four months.  (Romero Decl. at ¶¶ 6-9, 12-13 (Docket No. 80); \n24  Romero Dep. at 38: 20 – 41:10, Ex. VV).  Similarly, despite the damaging experiences suffered \n25  by Clark K. when DFS sent him to Texas (Clark K. Decl. at ¶¶ 17-19 (Docket No. 78)), DFS \n26 \n                                                 \n27  17 National studies indicate that between 50 and 80 percent of children in foster care suffer from moderate to severe \nmental health problems. (S. dosReis et al., Mental health services for youths in foster care and disabled youth, \n28  American Journal of Public Health, 91(7): 1094-1099 (2001), Ex. T).  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 9 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 17 of 47\n \n1  made no efforts to provide him with any mental health services upon his return to Las Vegas, \n2  despite his caseworker’s agreement that he needed counseling. (Id. at ¶¶ 22, 24-25; see also \n3  Anderson Dep. at 72:11 – 74:13, 113:9-13, Ex. WW (noting that DFS thwarted Clark’s \n4  grandparents’ efforts to obtain mental health services for him)).  DFS also deprived crucial mental \n5  health services to other named plaintiffs who had experienced the trauma of witnessing their \n6  sibling’s death.  (Logan Decl. ¶ 18, 19 (Docket No. 82); Logan Dep. at 115:1 – 116:19, 131:13 – \n7  133:6, Ex. TT).18  \n8  The named plaintiffs’ experiences are not unusual in Clark County.  Countless children in \n9  foster care are denied needed mental health services.  (See, e.g., March 26-29, 2001 DCFS Clark \n10  County Case Review at 227105, Ex. V (State review of Clark County finding that nearly 50% of \n11  foster children were not receiving adequate services to meet their physical and mental health \n12  needs); UNLV School of Social Work Report, A Survey of Foster Parents’ Satisfaction Toward \n13  Nevada’s System of Child Welfare (“Nevada Foster Parent Survey”) at 12, Ex. W (25% of foster \n14  parents reported that children with behavioral problems did not receive needed services); see also \n15  Declaration of Terrie Crawford (“Crawford Decl.”) at ¶¶ 20-23; March 28, 2008 Declaration of \n16  Marilyn Paikai (“Paikai Decl. II”) at ¶¶ 16-17)).  Foster youth who are provided with mental \n17  health services often experience significant delays. (See, e.g., Clark County Administrative Case \n18  Review at CC QA/QIR-0054, Ex. X (County consultant finds that a sexually abused child with \n19  serious mental health needs waited many months for counseling)).  In addition, the quality and \n20  effectiveness of services are often inadequate.  (See, e.g., Nevada Foster Parent Survey at 12, Ex. \n21  W (finding that one third of foster parents were dissatisfied with the quality of mental health \n22  services received by children in their homes)).  DFS Director Morton himself admits that \n23  “[r]egardless of what [needs are] identified, the same limited array of services is offered rather \n24  than individualizing services around the unique needs of the child and family.”  (Morton Report \n25  to Rep. Berkley at 10, Ex. D). \n                                                 \n26 \n18 When Mrs. Logan told Child Haven counselors that the A. children were having nightmares about their baby \n27  brother’s death and needed counseling, she was told “because they were not teary, they [Child Haven counselors] \nwould not bring up the situation.” (Logan Dep. at 132:16-133:6, Ex. TT).   Mrs. Logan was told that the children \n28  “were not entitled to other services because they were still in the placement of the haven.”  (Id.). \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 10 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 18 of 47\n \n1  Based on evidence gathered from Clark County through discovery, Defendants fail to \n2  provide necessary services to those youth with even the most serious mental health needs.  \n3  Incident Reports and Walkaway Checklists19 from the teen girls’ cottage at Child Haven prove \n4  that this leads to very dangerous situations for foster youth: \n5  •  A 14-year-old female diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD was allowed to leave \nChild Haven by herself (termed a “walk away”) just after midnight in her pajamas.  She \n6  had not been given her medication or mental health services for at least three weeks. \n(Child Haven Incident Reports and Walkway Checklists at CHIR036, Ex. Y). \n7 \n•  A 15-year-old diagnosed with bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) \n8  was allowed to walk away from Child Haven. She had not been receiving mental health \nservices or her prescribed medication.  (Id. at CHIR045, Ex. Y). \n9 \n•  A 12-year-old who cut herself all over her arms with a pencil sharpener was placed in the \n10  “day room” for observation.  She was not provided with any mental health services to \naddress her self-mutilation. (Id. at CHIR081, Ex. Y). \n11 \n12  (See also Id. at CHIR023; CHIR032; CHIR039; CHIR051-053; CHIR054; CHIR049; CHIR067; \n13  CHIR072; CHIR083; CHIR089 (describing similar situations to those detailed above), Ex. Y).   \n14  Additional reports confirm that Defendants lack an array of services to meet the needs of \n15  foster children with severe mental health issues.  (See, e.g., Missouri Alliance Report at 8-9, Ex. \n16  F) (County consultant found that children with high level mental health needs placed in so-called \n17  treatment homes are at risk due to lack of training, support, standards, and accountability, and \n18  high numbers of children in homes).  Indeed, Director Morton, himself, has stated that there are \n19  not adequate mental health placements and that “[o]ften, when a child is stabilized in an in-patient \n20  facility and ready for release, there is no lower level of care provider willing or able to accept the \n21  child.” (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 12, Ex. D).    \n22  b.  Denial of Medical and Dental Care \n23  The named plaintiffs have also experienced problems with access to medical and dental \n24  care.  For example, King A. had serious respiratory problems while at Child Haven, but was not \n25  taken to see a specialist for nine or ten months, during which time he was not allowed to go \n                                                 \n26  19 Incident Reports give a report of incidents occurring in the teen girls’ cottage (Nork), as well as actions taken as a \nresult.  Walkaway Checklists are filled out when youth leave Child Haven without permission and unsupervised.  See \n27 \nCrawford Decl. at ¶ 19 (noting that Child Haven staff regularly allowed her grandsons to “walkaway”). \n28   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 11 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 19 of 47\n \n1  outside at all.  (Logan Dep. at 116:13-16, Ex. TT; See also, Romero Dep. at 78:2-8, Ex. VV; \n2  Anderson Dep. at 101:9-21, Ex. WW).20  Defendants’ own documents demonstrate that access to \n3  adequate medical and dental care is a common problem for many Clark County foster youth.  \n4  (See, e.g., March 26-29, 2007 DCFS Clark County Case Review at STATE 227105, Ex. V) (State \n5  review of Clark County finding that nearly 50% of foster children were not receiving adequate \n6  services to meet their physical and mental health needs). \n7  Multiple sources suggest that DFS routinely fails to ensure that foster youth have access to \n8  Medicaid, which is a major barrier to obtaining medical care.  Foster parents have reported that \n9  “[t]imely access to a Medicaid card or Medicaid reference number is needed so that medical \n10  appointments and services can be scheduled and obtained in a timely manner” and that \n11  “[c]hildren are placed without a medical card or Medicaid reference number causing delays in \n12  scheduling medical appointments.”  (Statewide Multidisciplinary Team Quarterly Report, Jan-\n13  March 2007 at STATE 234023-234024, Ex. Z21; See also State Child Welfare Multidisciplinary \n14  Team Monthly Report, December 2006 at 19, Ex. BB (foster parents report lack of timely access \n15  to treatment, lengthy delays if prior authorization is needed from Medicaid)).   \n16  Denial of necessary medical and mental health services is itself a form of further neglect.  \n17  As shown above, all foster children in Clark County are at risk of suffering this additional harm \n18  while in the custody of Defendants. \n19  4.  Defendants Fail to Provide Foster Children With Stable Placements. \n20  Being removed from family and placed in foster care is a traumatic disruption in a child’s \n21  life.  Placement disruptions while in foster care cause additional harm to foster children, including \n22  affecting their educational progress and mental health outcomes.22  In addition, research has \n                                                 \n23 \n20 Recent declarations regarding children in DFS custody confirm these continuing problems.  (See Paikai II Decl. at \n24  ¶¶ 13-15, 18 & 20; Declaration of Nancy Danelson (“Danelson Decl.”) at ¶¶ 17-19). \n \n25 \n21 Although the State Multidisciplinary Team only reviews a small sample of cases, the fact that they reinforce the \n26  findings of other, independently conducted reviews – as well as the fact that each sample of cases reviews tends to \nreveal similar problems – lends them added significance.  (See 7/6/07 Decision Making Group Minutes at STATE \n27  226018, Ex. AA (stating “while the sample is not statistically significant, that most issues are apparent and keep \nshowing up review after review”)).   \n28  22 See Casey Alumni Study at 40-43, Ex. Q (optimizing placement stability had 22% reduction in undesirable mental \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 12 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 20 of 47\n \n1  shown that frequent placement disruptions while in foster care increase the risk of delinquency \n2  for boys in particular.23   \n3  Despite the known harms resulting from placement disruptions, Defendants operate a \n4  system in which placements often break down, and children are shuttled from one house, group \n5  home, and institution to another.  Not surprisingly, all of the named plaintiffs have experienced \n6  multiple placement disruptions while in the custody of DFS.  For example, Summer and Frank B. \n7  were moved eight or nine times in less than five months.  (Paikai Decl. I. at ¶¶ 7-15 (Docket No. \n8  79)).  These placement disruptions were due to many factors, including being abused or neglected \n9  in foster homes; being placed with foster parents who were ill-prepared and ill-supported to care \n10  for their many needs; and a combination of these and many other systemic deficiencies.  (See Id.; \n11  Paikai Dep. at 39:14 – 52:22, Ex. XX; see also Logan Dep. at 113:9 – 114:16, Ex. TT; Logan \n12  Decl. at ¶¶ 13-14 (Docket No. 82)).  \n13  Named plaintiffs’ experience of being shuttled from placement to placement while in the \n14  custody of Clark County DFS is common.  The last federal performance review of Nevada’s child \n15  welfare system found that only 31 percent of foster children in Clark County had stable \n16  placements. (Final Report, Nevada CFSR, June 1, 2004 at 31-33, Ex. DD).  Frequent placement \n17  disruptions led to a lack of continuity in services, changes in schools, and an overall negative \n18  impact on children’s well-being.  (Id. at 32; see also Danelson Decl. at ¶¶ 12 & 15; Crawford \n19  Decl. at ¶¶ 14 & 26).  Subsequent reports indicate that Clark County seriously undercounts the \n20  number of placements of children in its care.  A review of case files found that in over two-thirds \n21  of the cases reported to the federal government, children had experienced significantly more \n22  placement disruptions than were reported.  (AFCARS Assessment Review Findings: Foster Care \n23  Data Elements for Nevada, July 2006, at 13-15, Ex. EE (finding that a significant number of \n24  records had one move reported when the actual number of placements was between two and \n                                                                                                                                                               \n25 \nhealth outcomes, and almost 18% reduction in undesirable education outcomes).   \n26  23 See Abstract of Jospeh P. Ryan & Mark F.

CC (male victims of maltreatment with one placement in a foster home had a similar rate of delinquency to those \nwho remained in their family homes, but the rate of delinquency almost doubled for children with four or more \n28  placements while in foster care).   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 13 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 21 of 47\n \n1  five)).  Importantly, recent data provided by County Defendants themselves establishes that over \n2  40% of children who entered foster care between October 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006 \n3  experienced three or more placements during their time in foster care.24  (Clark County DFS \n4  Three or More Placements Data at FCPL009-027, Ex. FF).   \n5  The evidence cited above proves that Defendants operate a system in which foster \n6  children face the constant threat of placement disruption.  These disruptions are a symptom of the \n7  many systemic deficiencies and poor practices in Clark County, discussed in more detail below.  \n8  B.  Common DFS Practices Put All Class Members at Risk of Harm.  \n9  The harms described above are not the result of a few rogue caseworkers or freak \n10  accidents, but rather the natural consequence of Defendants’ failure to operate a system that \n11  protects and nurtures the abused and neglected children in its care.  Among the systemic \n12  deficiencies that have led to the current level of dysfunction are an ill-qualified, untrained, and \n13  unsupervised workforce burdened with overwhelming caseloads; a failure to effectively \n14  investigate reports of abuse and neglect; a failure to provide foster parents with critical \n15  information about the children placed in their home; a lack of adequate support for foster parents; \n16  a lack of reliable data and quality assurance systems; and the failure to provide children with \n17  advocates to make their voices heard.  These systemic deficiencies affect all class members, not \n18  just named plaintiffs.  As long as they are allowed to persist, all children will be at risk of \n19  suffering serious harm.    \n20  1.  Many DFS Caseworkers Lack the Qualifications, Training, and \nSupervision Necessary to Ensure Foster Children’s Safety and Well-\n21  Being.   \n22  In Clark County, high stakes decisions about the lives of foster children are entrusted to \n23  caseworkers who are often unprepared to perform their challenging job responsibilities.  They are \n24  frequently hired with no child welfare experience; they are not adequately trained to make the \n25 \n                                                 \n26  24 These numbers are even more disturbing considering that this data includes placement moves of children who were \nin the system for as few as 30 days.

Any one of these areas of \n3  concern – the low entry requirements, the nonexistent or at best “stop-gap” training, the lack of \n4  supervision – is dangerous on its own.  Combined, these deficiencies create a situation in which \n5  children will inevitably be subject to further harm.   \n6  a.  Lack of Qualifications  \n7  Clark County regularly hires caseworkers who lack any social work education or \n8  experience.  Clark County requires only that caseworkers have a bachelor’s degree in any social \n9  science – not social work in particular.  (See Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 176:13-15, Ex. YY).  Additionally, \n10  although the other regions of Nevada (Washoe County and the rural areas) require that child \n11  welfare caseworkers must be licensed as social workers, Clark County does not.  As Director \n12  Morton himself stated, “[t]hese entry requirements generally mean that new employees come \n13  without the critical skills needed to ensure the safety, permanency and well-being of children and \n14  to plan and facilitate family change.”  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 10, Ex. D).   \n15  b.  Lack of Training \n16  Despite the fact that new employees come to DFS lacking “critical skills,” Defendants fail \n17  to provide adequate training to new caseworkers. Defendant Morton has acknowledged that since \n18  workers come in with little (or no) experience, it is crucial that “comprehensive pre-service \n19  training be provided to new staff before assuming case responsibilities.”  (Morton Report to Rep. \n20  Berkley at 10, Ex. D).  He has admitted, however, that “[t]his has never happened in Clark \n21  County.”  (Id.  See also Missouri Alliance Report at 4, Ex. F (“[t]raining is vital to the integrity of \n22  clinical and case management practice performed by the agency” … “comprehensive training is \n23  not offered to new staff.”)). The only training currently provided to new caseworkers in Clark \n24  County is considered “stop-gap” even by the DFS Assistant Director in charge of training, and \n25  falls far short of preparing caseworkers to perform their crucial role in ensuring children’s safety \n26  and well-being.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 157:17-20, Ex. YY).   \n27  Further complicating this issue is the fact that Clark County DFS is uncertain who even \n28  has responsibility – the state or the county – for new caseworker training.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 15 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 23 of 47\n \n1  153:1-14, Ex. YY).  According to Defendant Morton, the “state has been unsuccessful in \n2  developing and delivering training that adequately prepares caseworkers for the job;” but since \n3  Clark County has never had its own training capacity, it has remained reliant on the state for \n4  provision of core training to new staff.  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 9, Ex. D).   \n5  As a result, according to a former DFS Assistant Director25 “[w]e have an untrained \n6  workforce and we have untrained supervisors, and people are struggling with knowing how to do \n7  their job.” (Rubin Dep. Vol II at 222:1-3, Ex. ZZ).  This same Assistant Director pointed to \n8  training as the greatest systemic issue in DFS, and the most prevalent issue brought to her by her \n9  managers, who supervised the large majority of caseworkers in the agency.  (Id. at 269:18 – \n10  270:18 (stating that caseworkers are not clear about many day to day details, including what to do \n11  before you place a child)).  She described the training needs as global: “investigative training, \n12  case management training, ongoing safety training, supervisory training, pretty much anything \n13  you can think of.” (Id. at 222:11-15, Ex. ZZ;  See also State Multidisciplinary Team Report Jan-\n14  March 2007 at STATE 234015-016, Ex. Z (describing basic types of training that are needed)). \n15  The lack of caseworker training puts all children in the class at risk of harm.  Defendant \n16  Morton himself has explicitly described the wide-ranging harms to children resulting from the \n17  lack of training: “The consequences of this [lack of comprehensive pre-service training] can be \n18  seen in reviewing almost every case.  … Safety and risk factors are often missed or \n19  misinterpreted.  Many caretaker and child needs are never identified…”  (Morton Report to Rep. \n20  Berkley at 10, Ex. D. (emphasis added); see also Rubin Dep. Vol. II at 270:24-25, Ex. ZZ (“if \n21  someone isn’t well trained, then a child could be put at risk”)).   \n22  c.  Poor Supervision \n23  The problems associated with a poorly qualified and trained staff are exacerbated by the \n24  absence of administrators and supervisors who have the professional training and background to \n25  provide adequate supervision.26  All the way up the chain of command, there is a serious lack of \n                                                 \n26 \n25 Ann Rubin was one of three Assistant Directors when she was deposed on November 13 and December 6, 2007, \n27  but she left the position in mid-December 2007. \n26 Notably, John Goad, an independent contractor County Defendants hired to evaluate aspects of their system, \n28 \nrecently wrote an extensive evaluation of the Michigan Department of Human Services.  He expressed serious \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 16 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 24 of 47\n \n1  child welfare experience.  In Clark County, most supervisors are not licensed as social workers \n2  and only about 25% of line supervisors have a master’s degree in social work. (79 Child Death \n3  Review Cases: Staff Qualifications, Exhibit HH).  Only one (out of six) of the Assistant Managers \n4  has a master’s degrees in social work (Id.).  Even the people at the highest levels of the State and \n5  County agencies do not necessarily have any background in child welfare.  (See Ruiz-Lee Dep. at \n6  28:3 – 29:4, Ex. YY (noting that before becoming an Assistant Director at DFS, Ms. Ruiz-Lee \n7  had never worked in a child welfare agency); Rubin Dep. at 29:9-10, Ex. ZZ (state administrators \n8  do not have a lot of child-welfare expertise)).   \n9  As Defendant Morton himself has acknowledged, multiple reviews of Clark County have \n10  noted that supervisors often lack knowledge and skills in monitoring casework, assisting workers \n11  in making decisions, holding workers accountable, and improving performance.  (Morton Report \n12  to Rep. Berkley at 11, Ex. D; see also Rubin Dep. Vol II at 221:13-20, Ex. ZZ (“[s]ystematically, \n13  there’s never been good supervisory training” statewide or locally, despite the fact that “everyone \n14  identifies that the supervisor line is the most critical line in child welfare.”); Agency Improvement \n15  Plan for Clark County DFS (“AIP”), Ex. II; Statewide Multidisciplinary Team Report Jan-March \n16  2007 at 234016, Ex. Z)).  \n17  This lack of such essential supervisory skills has negative consequences for children.  As \n18  noted in the Agency Improvement Plan for Clark County DFS,27 “[i]nadequate supervisory \n19  oversight and QA [quality assurance] at case closure” impacts the safety goal of keeping children \n20  “first and foremost protected from abuse and neglect.”  (AIP at 130000099, Ex. II). \n21  Caseworkers are the immediate protectors of foster children’s safety and well-being.  Yet, \n22  as shown above, Clark County caseworkers are not prepared or supported to fulfill that role, \n23  placing all foster children at risk of harm.   \n24 \n25                                                                                                                                                                 \nconcerns about top administrators in a child welfare agency holding positions “critical to the protection of …foster \n26 \nchildren” lacking any education or experience to prepare them to fulfill their challenging responsibilities.”  (John \nGoad, Michigan Department of Health Services: An Evaluation of the Capacity to Assure the Safety of Foster \n27 \nChildren, February 11, 2008, at 7, Ex. GG). \n28  27 Agency Improvement Plans are part of the federal review process of state child welfare agencies.   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 17 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 25 of 47\n \n1  2.  DFS Caseworkers Have Dangerously High Caseloads. \n2  Compounding the impact of the lack of experience and training, many Clark County case \n3  workers are also burdened with unmanageable caseloads.  Defendant Morton recognizes that \n4  generally accepted professional standards for child welfare practice recommend caseloads of 12 \n5  to 15 children per case manager.  (Letter from Tom Morton and Virginia Valentine to Governor \n6  Gibbons (“Morton Letter to Gov. Gibbons”) at 2, Ex. JJ).  He has admitted, however, that \n7  “currently foster care caseloads are at a dangerously high level of 39 children per case manager” \n8  and that such caseload ratios place children “at an unacceptable level of risk.” (Id. at 2; see also \n9  Rubin Dep. Vol II at 220:4-8, Ex. ZZ (stating that “[m]any workers have over 40 kids” and \n10  several in-home workers “have over 50.”); Missouri Report at 4, Ex. F (finding in their \n11  caseworker interviews that “caseloads of 40-60 were common.”)).  Defendant Morton has also \n12  admitted that “[u]niformly, all examinations of Nevada’s child welfare system have cited high \n13  caseloads as a preeminent threat to the safety, permanency, and well-being of abused and \n14  neglected children in Nevada.”  (Morton Letter to Gov. Gibbons at 1, Ex. JJ;28 See also Morton \n15  Report to Rep. Berkeley at 8, Ex. D (stating that “in virtually every aspect of DFS operation, the \n16  agency remains understaffed relative to the levels necessary to meet the safety, permanency and \n17  well-being needs of maltreated children.”); Missouri Alliance Report at 4, Ex. F (“overwhelming \n18  size of caseloads carried by permanency case managers constrains even the best case manager \n19  from carrying out best practices in child welfare.”)).  \n20  High caseloads impact caseworkers’ ability to meet children’s basic needs for safety, well-\n21  being, and permanency in many ways, including: \n22  •  High caseloads prevent caseworkers from having contact with children and families, the \nmost important factor in keeping children safe.  Defendant Morton has acknowledged that \n23  high caseloads have a direct impact on “frequency of child and family contact.” (Morton \nReport to Rep. Berkley at 8, Ex. D; see also Rubin Dep. Vol II at 220:1-15, Ex. ZZ (high \n24  caseloads are “a huge systemic issue that relates back to why children aren’t seen on a \nregular basis.”); AIP at 130000102, Ex. II (noting that the “[i]nability to manage or \n25 \n                                                 \n26  28 Although 27 new case manager positions have been approved, as of January 2008, none of these positions had \nbeen filled.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 236:10-14, Ex. YY). According to DFS leadership, the caseload situation may well \n27  have worsened since Morton sent his letter to Governor Gibbons due to an increase in foster children. (Id. at 234:3-\n11).  Additionally, even if the positions are filled, caseloads will still remain above professional standards.  (Id. at \n28  235:1-21).  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 18 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 26 of 47\n \n1  coordinate visitations due to high caseloads” prevent workers from increasing the \nfrequency of visits)).   \n2 \n•  High caseloads lead to inadequate assessments, or a failure to conduct assessments at all.  \n3  (See Morton Report to Rep. Berkeley at 9, Ex. D (stating that caseworkers lack sufficient \ntime to conduct a comprehensive assessment); see also AIP at 130000100, Ex. II \n4  (identifying high caseloads (or lack of training) as leading to “inadequate assessment of \nchildren’s needs”)).   \n5 \n•  High case loads harm children’s chances of achieving permanency.  (See Rubin Dep. Vol \n6  II at 220:19- 221:1, Ex. ZZ (citing “timely movement to permanency for children” as \nbeing most severely impacted by high caseloads); AIP at 130000100 & 01, Ex. II \n7  (identifying high caseloads as a factor preventing achievement of permanency goals \nappropriate to the child’s needs)). \n8 \n9  The above evidence proves that Clark County is staffed by ill-qualified, inadequately \n10  trained, and poorly supervised caseworkers who are burdened with caseloads three or more times \n11  larger than recommended levels.  Under these circumstances, named plaintiffs29 and all foster \n12  children are placed at risk of harm.  \n13  3.  DFS Fails to Conduct Adequate Investigations of Child Abuse/Neglect \nComplaints.   \n14 \n15  Clark County routinely fails to investigate reports of abuse or neglect placing countless \n16  children in serious risk.  (See, e.g., Paikai II Decl. at ¶ 5; Crawford Decl. at ¶ 9).  The experiences \n17  of the named plaintiffs provide vivid examples of such failures, and the terrible harms that result.  \n18  Clark County DFS failed to investigate the multiple reports of abuse and neglect that were made \n19  while the A. children were living in one of their foster homes (Logan Decl. at ¶ 10 (Docket No. \n20  82); , Logan Dep. at 52:11 – 53:18, 123:18 – 125:6, Ex. TT); failed to investigate reports and \n21  evidence of sexual abuse of Summer B. and physical abuse of Frank B. in a foster home (Paikai \n22  Decl. I at ¶¶ 6, 11-12 (Docket No. 79)); and failed to investigate multiple reports of abuse or \n23  neglect of Clark K. and his little brother before he entered care (Clark K. Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3 (Docket \n24  No. 78)).  After deciding to place Clark K. and Donna C. back with their respective biological \n25  mothers, DFS did not even bother to check in on their status, resulting in serious harm to both \n26  children. (Id. at ¶ 16; Romero Decl. at ¶ 10). \n                                                 \n27 \n29 Information obtained through discovery shows that the A. children’s caseworker has 43 cases on her caseload.  \n28  (AFCARS 0074, Ex. KK).   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 19 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 27 of 47\n \n1  Clark County’s failure to conduct adequate investigations is documented in multiple \n2  sources, including recent child fatality public disclosure forms, reports of the Statewide \n3  Multidisciplinary Team, and reports of independent child welfare consultants hired by Clark \n4  County.  Child Welfare Consultant Edward Cotton’s review of abuse and neglect investigations in \n5  Clark County30 revealed that investigations were not initiated in a timely manner, insufficient \n6  information was gathered to make a good judgment in more than half of the cases reviewed, and \n7  investigators’ decisions to rule a child abuse complaint substantiated or unsubstantiated were \n8  incorrect in two-thirds of the cases.  (Independent Consultant Edward Cotton’s Administrative \n9  Review of Child Abuse and Neglect Investigations at 4, 18, 23-25, Ex. LL. See also Statewide \n10  Multidisciplinary Team Report, Jan-March 2007 at STATE 234004, Ex. Z (finding that only 50% \n11  of children in the sample were seen immediately when the allegations suggested present danger)).  \n12  Notably, Defendant Morton has affirmed these findings, admitting that inadequate abuse and \n13  neglect investigations are the norm in Clark County.  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 6-7, Ex. \n14  D; See also Id. at 9-10 (noting that investigations are generally brief and that staff lack training on \n15  how to conduct investigations)).31  Most recently, Assistant DFS Director Ruiz-Lee confirmed \n16  that there is no reliable data to refute the findings of the Cotton reviews or to suggest that the \n17  quality of investigations has improved at all.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 141:7-143:2, Ex. YY). \n18  Recent child fatalities reported on the State’s website provide further evidence that the \n19  failure to conduct adequate child protective services investigations has dire consequences for \n20  children. See supra Part III.A.1.  In 22 (44%) of the 50 child deaths in 2007 reported at the \n21  website the family had a history of child protective services referrals.  In a third of those cases \n22  there were four or more reports of abuse or neglect before the incident leading to the child’s \n23  death.32 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  30 Prior to conducting his review of over 1300 child welfare cases in Clark County (Cotton Report, Ex. E), Mr. \nCotton was hired to review child abuse and neglect investigations conducted by DFS.   \n26  31 Though both County and state Defendants expended much effort trying to undermine or discredit some of the \nfindings of the Cotton Report, Defendant Morton relied extensively upon Mr. Cotton’s findings in his June 2007 \n27 \nreport to U.S. Representative Berkley. \n28  32 See http://dcfs.state.nv.us/DCFS_ChildFatalities_Disclosures_Clark.htm (last visited 3/11/08).   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 20 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 28 of 47\n \n1  The ability to make determinations about children’s safety is one of the core \n2  responsibilities, if not the primary role, of a child welfare agency.  Defendants’ failure to \n3  adequately perform this most basic and critical task – as evidenced by the many sources of \n4  information described above – places all children in the class at risk of harm.   \n5  4.  DFS Fails to Regularly Visit Children In its Custody to Ensure Their \nHealth and Safety.   \n6 \n7  The failure to conduct regular caseworker visits is a chronic problem in Clark County that \n8  has placed named plaintiffs and class members at risk.  See e.g., Crawford Decl. at ¶ 13.  For \n9  example, named plaintiffs Donna C. and Clark K. each suffered significant harm when DFS \n10  placed them back with biological parents without conducting appropriate safety assessments and \n11  then failed to visit them.  (Romero Decl. at  ¶¶ 7 & 10 (Docket No. 80); Clark K. Decl. at ¶¶ 14-\n12  15, 17-20, 25 (Docket No. 78)).  \n13  Numerous sources have documented DFS’s chronic failure to regularly visit foster \n14  children, and Defendant Morton has admitted that “conducting regular visits with children and \n15  parents is an ongoing challenge.”  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 7, Ex. D (noting that Cotton \n16  case review found that less than 50% of kids had been seen in last 30 days, 33% had been visited \n17  in last 30-60 days, and more than 20% had not been seen in more than 60 days). See also \n18  Statewide Multidisciplinary Team Report, Jan-March 2007 at STATE 234024, Ex. Z (finding that \n19  foster parents repeatedly reported concern that children are not contacted or visited regularly by \n20  workers; in three particular instances, workers failed to visit for 12 to 18 months)).33  Defendant \n21  Morton has also voiced serious concerns about his agency’s failure to visit children regularly.  \n22  When he was first advised of the Cotton review finding that many children were not receiving \n23  regular visits, he said, “I consider this situation very dangerous . . .” (Email from Tom Morton \n24  (5/28/06), CCCR-1176-77, Ex. MM).  Given that caseworkers are still burdened with \n25  overwhelming caseloads, it seems inevitable that this dangerous situation still exists.   \n                                                 \n26 \n33 Defendants also appear to have no accurate information about how often caseworkers are actually visiting children \n27  other than the case reviews; data from the State and County varies wildly.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 144:22–46:6, Ex. YY \n(“there is a discrepancy between the UNITY data and the hand-counted data”); Rubin Dep. at 74:1–5:8, Ex. ZZ).  \n28  Nor do they track any information about the length or quality of visits. (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 147:22–148:20, Ex. YY).   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 21 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 29 of 47\n \n1  5.  DFS Fails to Provide Foster Parents with Adequate Information About \nChildren Placed in Their Homes and Fails to Provide Them Adequate  \n2  Support.   \n3  Defendants regularly fail to provide foster parents with critical information about their \n4  foster children or with adequate support to meet their needs.  (See, e.g., Statewide \n5  Multidisciplinary Team Report, Jan-March 2007 at STATE 234018, Ex. Z (finding that “[f]oster \n6  parents should have better supervision/screening of foster homes, support services for foster \n7  homes, placement transition planning, strengthen FC recruitment/matching” and “should be \n8  adequately prepared when children with emotional problems are placed in their care.”)  See also \n9  Paikai II Decl. at ¶¶ 10, 12 & 14; Danelson Decl. at ¶¶ 13-14).  The experiences of the named \n10  plaintiffs illustrate the harms that can and do result from this systemic problem.  For example, \n11  Jalen A. and his siblings were placed in shelter and foster homes that lacked the information and \n12  services to care adequately for their basic needs, leading to tragic results. (Logan Decl. at ¶ 13 \n13  (Docket No. 82); Logan Dep. at 121:4-16, 123:2-17, Ex. TT).  Donna C. and the B. children were \n14  similarly placed in multiple foster homes that were not given critical background and health \n15  information, leading to the failure of many of those placements.  (See Romero Decl. at ¶11 \n16  (Docket No. 80); Paikai Decl. I at ¶¶ 2, 6-10, 13-14 (Docket No. 79); Paikai Dep. at 123:15 – \n17  124:6, Ex. XX).  In addition, DFS’s failure to inform Clark K.’s grandparents about the hearings \n18  in which the decision was made to send Clark to Texas or seek their involvement had dire \n19  consequences for him.  (Anderson Dep. at 31:18–32:5, Ex. WW).   \n20  Documents obtained through discovery confirm that the lack of information described \n21  above is common and pervasive within the agency, exposing all children in the class to risk of \n22  harm.

NN (finding that Clark County lacks sufficient respite resources)).  This lack of information \n7  and support directly affects not just the day-to-day safety of children, but also the stability of their \n8  placements. (Statewide Multidisciplinary Team Report, Jan-March 2007 at STATE 234023, Ex.

Z (noting failed foster placement due to lack of medical knowledge)).   \n13  DFS entrusts the daily care of many of the children in its custody to foster parents of its \n14  choosing.  To ensure the safety and well-being of the vulnerable children in its care, it is DFS’ \n15  obligation to adequately train, inform, and support foster parents.  As demonstrated by the \n16  evidence above, DFS falls far short of living up to this responsibility.   \n17  6.  Defendants Lack an Adequate Management Information and Quality \nAssurance System.    \n18 \n19  As a matter of good practice, child welfare agencies must maintain accurate up-to-date \n20  information about children in their care in order to ensure health and safety.  On a broader level, it \n21  is also critical that agencies use data as part of an overall quality assurance system to monitor the \n22  general functioning of the system and make needed improvements.

(9/25/07 DMG Minutes at STATE 226038), \n13  Ex. QQ (DFS Director Morton expressing “concern that UNITY does not count children in non-\n14  paid placements”).

(Blue Ribbon Panel \n2  Report at 4, Ex. PP (finding that “[t]he State needs to have in place a system of oversight and \n3  accountability.”).  Defendants’ UNITY database is mired with problems that impede “effective \n4  case and agency management” (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 10, Ex. D).37 and the current \n5  case review process is lacking. Although County Defendants entered into a one-time contract \n6  with Consultant Ed Cotton for a review of child welfare cases involving children under the age of \n7  six years in 2005-2006, the case review protocol utilized in the Cotton Report has not been \n8  incorporated into the County Defendants’ practices.  (See Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 52:21-23, 55:1-14, \n9  Ex. YY (testimony about number of cases reviewed and admission that they are woefully \n10  inadequate to determine if policies are being implemented).  See also Rubin Depo, Vol II at \n11  243:17-19, Ex. ZZ (agency does not currently do random case reviews)).38 \n12  The harms from the dysfunctional data system and lack of quality assurance process are \n13  many.  As Defendant Morton explained: \n14  Managers have had to make decisions based on anecdotal information or based on their \npersonal assumptions about the performance of the organization.  Without systematic \n15  quality assurance activities, the true size of problems was never known, leading to some \ninstances in which problems were incorrectly assumed to be isolated when, in fact, they \n16  were prevalent.  \n17  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 11, Ex. D).  Such management practices and deficiencies \n18  contribute to an unsafe environment in which all children in foster care are exposed to \n19  unnecessary risk.  \n20 \n21                                                   \n37 In response to this dysfunction, County Defendants have developed several free-standing databases, which they \n22 \nrefer to as the Reporting Module and COGNOS.  But these databases are also incomplete.  (Ruiz-Lee Dep. at 114:7-\n13, 223:13 – 224:14, Ex. YY).  Additionally, many staff, units, and supervisors have developed their own so-called \n23 \ndatabases, which are often no more than hand counts on a piece of paper, where significant amounts of information \nare stored.  The information in these “underground databases” is isolated from other data sources, frequently \n24 \ninaccurate, and sometimes only in hard copy files.  (Morton Rpt to Rep. Berkley at 10, Ex. D; Ruiz-Lee Dep. at \n121:17-19, 146:4 – 147:5, Ex. YY).  As a result, data about any given child may be strewn throughout a variety of \n25 \npossible locations; data in the individual databases may not be in UNITY; and critical information about a child may \nbe kept only in hard copy form.  (Rubin Dep. Vol. II at 208:14 – 212:23, Ex. ZZ).   \n26 \n38 State Defendants use case reviews as part of a Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement process, but those reviews \n27  occur infrequently – every nine months – and include less than 30 cases.  (Morton Report to Rep. Berkley at 4).  \nAlthough these reviews have revealed a variety of on-going problems in Clark County, they provide only a snapshot \n28  of practice, and are not used in conjunction with review of more comprehensive data.  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 25 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 33 of 47\n \n1  7.  Defendants Fail to Provide Foster Children with an Advocate in Their \nCourt Proceedings.    \n2 \n3  In abuse and neglect cases, critical decisions affecting a child’s life are made at the initial \n4  court hearing determining whether the child should be removed from his or her family.  \n5  Subsequent hearings may address equally fundamental issues such as where the child will live or \n6  who may have contact with the child.  With such important matters at stake, foster children need \n7  an advocate in dependency court to ensure their voice is heard.  Given the many systemic \n8  problems documented above, including unmanageable caseloads, it is all the more important for \n9  the child to have an advocate because case workers may not be aware of crucial issues. \n10  Unfortunately, only about 35% of children in Clark County are provided with a guardian \n11  ad litem or attorney. 39  Moreover, of those few children who are represented, the vast majority do \n12  not have any representation until well after many critical decisions are made about their lives.  \n13  (Hiltz Decl. at ¶ 20 (estimating that that 90% of the referrals received by CAP are to represent \n14  children who have been in the foster care system for a year of more and that two-thirds have no \n15  representation at termination of parental rights hearings); Thacker Dep. at 134:11-17, Ex. AAA \n16  (estimating that at least 90% of children do not have CASAs appointed until their review \n17  hearings)).  In fact, professionals at CAP and CASA have provided estimates suggesting that only \n18  about 3.5% of Clark County children are represented by either an attorney or guardian ad litem \n19  during their first year in care when crucial decisions are being made about their fates.  (Id.).40  \n20  The failure to provide children with representation in dependency proceedings not only \n21  denies them a role in important decisions about their lives, but also leads to ill-informed decisions \n22  and eliminates an important safeguard against harm. The experiences of the named plaintiffs \n23  demonstrate the harm that can occur when children are denied representation.  For example, \n                                                 \n24  39 See Deposition of Patricia Thacker (“Thacker Dep.” at 48:11-13, Ex. AAA (about 400 children in Clark County \nhave a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA)); Declaration of Steven Hiltz (“Hiltz Decl.”) at ¶ 8 (the \n25 \nChildren’s Attorney Project (CAP) provides legal representation to approximately 1,000 children).  The estimate of \n35% assumes there is not an overlap in these populations, and is based on an approximation that there are 4,000 \n26 \nchildren in foster care in Clark County.  See infra Part IV.A.   \n27  40 If 90% of the 1,400 children who are represented do not get a CAP attorney or CASA until after their first year or \nreview hearing, this means that only 10%, or 140, are represented at earlier stages of the dependency process.  These \n28  140 children represent about 3.5% of the approximately 4,000 children in the Clark County foster care system.  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 26 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 34 of 47\n \n1  during their first year in care, neither the A. children nor the B. children were provided a guardian \n2  ad litem or an attorney.  During this time, the children experienced a variety of harms — \n3  including multiple placement changes, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and, tragically, the death \n4  of a sibling.  (Paikai Decl. I at ¶¶ 3, 4, 7, 10, 11 (Docket No. 79); Logan Decl. ¶¶ 4, 10, 12-14).  \n5  Clark K., who has never been provided with representation of any kind, suffered horribly when \n6  neither he nor his grandparents were permitted to attend a court hearing that resulted in his re-\n7  location to Texas.  (Clark K. Decl. at ¶¶ 7-10, 17-18 (Docket No. 78); Danelson Decl. at ¶ 16; \n8  Paikai II Decl. at ¶ 25). \n9  Many of the harms experienced by named plaintiffs may well have been avoided or at \n10  least mitigated had Defendants provided them with the advocates to which they are entitled.  \n11  Given the chronic shortage of advocates in Clark County, this is a common experience for many \n12  class members.    \n13  IV.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLASS IS ENTITLED TO CERTIFICATION UNDER THE \nRULE 23(A) LEGAL STANDARD.    \n14 \nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class of all children who have been, are, or will be victims of \n15 \nchild abuse and neglect and have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of Clark County DFS.  \n16 \nBecause of the widespread and systemic nature of the violations at issue in this case, it is \n17 \nappropriate – and critical – for the Court to certify this case as a class action.   \n18 \nPlaintiffs have described in some detail the harms suffered and pervasive risks to which \n19 \nchildren in the putative class are subjected while in Defendants’ custody.  See Section III.A. \n20 \nWhile the nature and extent of the harms suffered by class members varies, those individual \n21 \ndifferences are of little consequence to class certification.  The plaintiff class seeks only \n22 \ninjunctive relief, not individual damages, so an individual inquiry into the relief to be afforded \n23 \neach class member is not required.  \n24 \nPlaintiffs have also provided overwhelming evidence, most of it from Defendants \n25 \nthemselves, that those injuries and risks are not the result of a few incompetent or maverick \n26 \ncaseworkers nor are they isolated to a few of Defendants’ offices.  See Section III.B.  They result \n27 \nfrom system-wide practices and deficiencies including unmanageable caseloads, poor training and \n28 \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 27 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 35 of 47\n \n1  supervision, and inadequate data and accountability practices.  Taken together, the litany of harms \n2  and the widespread practices contributing to such harms, clearly satisfy the two factors – \n3  commonality and typicality – for which the Court sought additional information before ruling on \n4  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.   \n5  As plaintiffs discussed in their initial class certification papers, Rule 23 promotes judicial \n6  efficiency by permitting many parties to litigate similar claims in one action, thereby eliminating \n7  multiple and duplicative litigation.  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. \n8  denied 526 U.S. 1003 (1999).  A party seeking certification must show that:  (1) the proposed \n9  class is so numerous that joining all members individually is impractical (“numerosity”); (2) the \n10  class shares at least one common question of fact or law (“commonality”); (3) the class \n11  representatives’ claims are typical of the class (“typicality”); and (4) the named plaintiffs will \n12  fairly protect the interests of the class (“adequacy of representation”).  Hanon v. Dataproducts \n13  Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).   \n14  The sole question in determining the propriety of class certification is whether the \n15  requirements of Rule 23 are met; this analysis does not include an inquiry into whether plaintiffs \n16  have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits.  Jordan v. Los Angeles County, 669 \n17  F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982); Eisen v. \n18  Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974).  To this end, when analyzing plaintiffs’ Rule 23 \n19  showing, the District Court “is bound to take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true.”  \n20  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 fn.17 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816 (1976) \n21  cited by Hernandez v. Alexander, 152. F.R.D. 192 (D.Nev 1993); Thomas v. Baca, 231 F.R.D. \n22  397, 399 (C.D. Cal. 2005).  In addition, while this Court has discretion to determine the propriety \n23  of class certification, the exercise of that discretion must be within the framework of Rule 23.  \n24  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 630 (1997); Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, \n25  100 (1981).41  Plaintiffs meet all of the Rule 23 requirements, as set forth in detail below.   \n                                                 \n26  41 For example, applying an overly-restrictive legal standard in evaluating the requirements of Rule 23 constitutes an \nabuse of discretion, subject to reversal.  Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 60 (3d Cir. 1994); see also Hawkins v. \n27 \nComparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, 1237 (9th Cir. 2001) (abuse of discretion when court’s certification assessment \nand ruling are “premised on legal error.”); Griffin v.

THE COURT HAS RULED THAT PLAINTIFFS’ CLASS IS SO \nNUMEROUS THAT JOINDER IS IMPRACTICAL.   \n2 \n3  This Court has already held that plaintiffs’ proposed class meets the numerosity \n4  requirement for certification.  May 14, 2007 Order at 44-45 (Docket No. 134) (“Plaintiffs satisfy \n5  the numerosity requirement.”).  The Court’s conclusion was based on “the very numbers that \n6  Defendants have determined are in the Clark County foster system.”  Id. at 44.  Given that those \n7  numbers have not changed significantly,42 this Court should affirm its earlier ruling that the class \n8  is so numerous that joinder is impractical.  \n9  B.  THE CLASS SHARES COMMON ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT. \n10  The second prerequisite to certification as a class action is that “there are questions of law \n11  or fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  The requirement of “commonality” \n12  ensures that the class shares sufficiently comparable grievances that can be redressed through a \n13  collective remedy.  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (commonality aims to \n14  verify that “maintenance of a class action is economical”), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 812 (2002); see \n15  also Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir. 1998) (commonality ensures “practical and \n16  efficient case management”), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1003 (1999).  \n17  1.  In the Ninth Circuit, the Burden of Establishing Commonality Is \nMinimal.   \n18 \n19  The Ninth Circuit construes the commonality requirement “permissively” and has \n20  described the requirement as “minimal.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d 1011, 1019-1020 (burden of \n21  establishing commonality is minimal); see also Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168, 1177 \n22  (9th Cir. 2007); Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1321 (permissive application means class usually establishes \n23  commonality).  The commonality test is “qualitative rather than quantitative – one significant \n24  issue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant certification.”  Dukes v. Wal-Mart, 509 \n25  F.3d 1168, 1177 (9th Cir. 2007)(citations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that the \n26 \n                                                 \n42 According to data provided from the Clark County DFS database, nearly 4,000 children were in foster care in \n27 \nClark County from 10/01/06 – 9/30/07.  (Clark County Placement Data, Ex. RR, DFSLCFC030 – DFSLCFC045).  \nAnd according to data provided by the State, there were 4,173 children in foster care in Clark County as of October \n28  31, 2007.  (AFCARS Placement Summary for State, Clark, and Washoe, for 10-31-2007 at STATE 223007, Ex.

Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001)(emphasis added)(quoting \n3  Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994) (commonality met if class representatives \n4  share “at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class”)); see also \n5  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (“The existence of shared legal issues with \n6  divergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with \n7  disparate legal remedies.”).  The fact that the class seeks only injunctive relief further supports a \n8  finding that commonality is satisfied.  Because suits seeking solely class-wide injunctive relief do \n9  not require individualized inquiries to determine damage awards, they “by their very nature often \n10  present common questions satisfying Rule 23(a)(2).”  7A Wright et al., Section 1763 at 201. \n11  2.  Plaintiffs Surpass the Minimal Commonality Requirement.  \n12  In this case plaintiffs easily surpass the minimal requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  Though \n13  Ninth Circuit case law dictates that they need only share one common question of law or fact to \n14  satisfy the commonality requirement, the named plaintiffs share many questions of law and fact \n15  with the prospective class.  In fact, common questions of fact and law form the core of the named \n16  plaintiffs’ claims, which are co-extensive with the claims of the class as a whole.   \n17  Plaintiff children challenge long-standing, systemic deficiencies in Defendants’ foster care \n18  system that cause harm and risk of harm not only to the named plaintiffs, but inevitably to all \n19  children in the system.  As such, the ability of plaintiff foster children – as well as the ability of \n20  the class as a whole – to prevail in challenging Defendants’ conduct rests on the resolution of the \n21  same legal and factual issues.  These common questions include:    \n22  •  Whether Defendants’ operation of a dysfunctional system regularly places all children in \nfoster care at risk of harm; specifically, risk of death, abuse and neglect, denial of needed \n23  medical and mental health services, and placement instability;  \n24  •  Whether the following deficiencies exist in the Clark County child welfare system, \nplacing children at risk of the above described harms: \n25 \no  A caseworker training program so lacking that caseworkers are ill-equipped to \n26  provide critical support to children and families; \n27  o  Assignment of overwhelming caseloads to poorly qualified, trained, and \nsupervised caseworkers; \n28 \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 30 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 38 of 47\n \n1  o  Routine failure to adequately investigate allegations of abuse and neglect; \n2  o  Failure to ensure that foster children receive timely visits from caseworkers; \n3  o  Failure to provide critical information to foster parents about children in their \ncare, as well as the support they need to provide adequate care; \n4 \no  Lack of representation for foster children in dependency court hearings, \n5  denying them a voice in the decisions Defendants make about their lives; \n6  •  Whether Defendants’ operation of a foster care program with the deficiencies \ndescribed above, among many others – violates the mandates of the Substantive Due \n7  Process Clauses of the United States and Nevada Constitutions, the Federal Adoption \nAssistance Act, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Medicaid Act. \n8 \n9  These common questions were pled in the original complaint and described in the original \n10  motion for class certification.  The present motion provides overwhelming evidence of the \n11  common questions of law and fact that permeate this case.  See generally supra Part III.   \n12  3.  Cases Challenging System-wide Policies and Practices Have Regularly \nBeen Found to Meet the Commonality Requirement.   \n13 \n14  In civil-rights cases such as this one, the Ninth Circuit has held that “commonality is \n15  satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the \n16  putative class members.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing LaDuke \n17  v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985)); Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045, 1047 (9th \n18  Cir. 1998) (common question of law where plaintiffs challenge constitutionality of INS \n19  procedures), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1003 (1999).   \n20  Across the nation, federal courts have granted class certification in actions specifically \n21  related to foster care asserting identical or analogous allegations of common questions of law or \n22  fact.  See e.g., Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming district court’s \n23  finding of commonality where common question of law was whether each child has a legal \n24  entitlement to services and common question of fact was whether defendants systematically have \n25  failed to provide those legally mandated services); Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. \n26  1994) (finding “DHS’s systemic deficiencies in providing legally mandated child care services” \n27  to be a common legal basis to support class certification); Kenny A. v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, \n28  300 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (citing Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 53, 60) (commonality met where plaintiffs’ \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 31 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 39 of 47\n \n1  challenge “systemic deficiencies” in “implementation of support programs and services for all \n2  foster children”).   \n3  The Ninth Circuit – along with its constituent district courts – has cited with approval the \n4  Rule 23 analysis laid out by the Third Circuit in Baby Neal. Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, \n5  868 (9th Cir. 2001); Ziufang Situ v. Leavitt, 240 F.R.D. 551, 561 (N.D. Cal. 2007); Ferrari v. \n6  Gisch, 225 F.R.D. 599, 606-07 (C.D. Cal. 2004).  Like the foster children before this court, \n7  plaintiffs in Baby Neal asserted numerous violations of their legal entitlement to comprehensive \n8  foster care services.  The Third Circuit found that the class easily met the commonality \n9  requirement of Rule 23, holding that “putative class members in this case share the common legal \n10  claim that DHS’s systemic deficiencies result in widespread violations of their statutory and \n11  constitutional rights.” Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 61 (3d Cir. 1994).  The Third Circuit \n12  further observed that Rule 23(b)(2) classes “have been certified in a legion of civil rights cases \n13  where commonality findings were based primarily on the fact that defendant’s conduct is central \n14  to the claims of all class members…”  Id. at 57 (citation omitted).   \n15  Here, just as in Baby Neal, the putative class members share the common legal claim that \n16  the systemic deficiencies in the foster care system operated by Clark County and overseen by the \n17  State of Nevada result in widespread violations of their statutory and constitutional rights.  See \n18  generally SAC (Docket No. 142-1).   \n19  4.  Individual Factual Differences Among Litigants Do Not Preclude a \nFinding of Commonality In Suits Challenging System-wide Practices. \n20 \n21  The Ninth Circuit has explicitly held that in suits challenging system-wide practices \n22  affecting all class members, “individual factual differences among the individual litigants or \n23  groups of litigants will not preclude a finding of commonality.” Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d \n24  849, 868 (citing Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56); see also Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047-1048 \n25  (commonality satisfied where plaintiffs make a common allegation about the unconstitutionality \n26  of the defendant’s actions, despite factual distinctions in the class members’ underlying claims); \n27  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998) (“the existence of shared legal \n28  issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient…”).  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 32 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 40 of 47\n \n1  Indeed, as the court in Baby Neal observed, Defendants’ “violations exist independently \n2  of individual children’s circumstances; Defendants’ misconduct is established by reference to the \n3  objective statutory and constitutional criteria.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 62 (emphasis added).  Here, \n4  plaintiff foster children have alleged that DFS and DCFS have failed to provide them with \n5  adequate and legally required services, violating their constitutional and statutory rights.  Those \n6  violations exist independently of the particular circumstances of the named plaintiffs and all other \n7  individual class members.   \n8  a.  Commonality Exists Where Class Members Are at Risk of \nSuffering Harm Due to Systemic Legal Violations.   \n9 \n10  In determining commonality, district courts need only examine plaintiffs’ claims to \n11  determine whether all class members are at risk of suffering a legal violation should plaintiffs \n12  ultimately prove systemic violations – not whether they have already suffered injury.  Walters v. \n13  Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998) (certification appropriate even where some class \n14  members have not been injured or aggrieved by defendants’ conduct), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1003 \n15  (1999).  Plaintiffs can demonstrate commonality by showing that system-wide deficiencies \n16  “either violate class members’ rights currently or subject them to the risk of such a violation.”  \n17  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d 60-61; See also Id. at 56; Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, \n18  155 (1982) (certification permits adjudication of issues “potentially affecting every [class \n19  member])” (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1976)).  In the present case, while \n20  the nature and extent of their exposure to risk varies from day to day, from placement to \n21  placement, the risk of harm is ever-present for all class members.  All plaintiffs are subject to the \n22  same common course of conduct by Defendants, putting them all at risk of harm. \n23  Further, due to the uniquely transitory nature of foster care, it is “unreasonable to require \n24  that all plaintiffs suffer from the same injury simultaneously.” Baby Neal, 43 F.3d 48, 60.43 \n                                                 \n25  43 Additionally, because common question relates to the Defendants’ course of conduct, it is not a barrier to class \ncertification that some class members were not subject to the illegal practices alleged by the class as a whole.  \n26 \nWalters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir. 1998) (commonality satisfied where some but not all class members \nreceived proper treatment), cert. denied 526 U.S. 1003 (1999).  In fact, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that would \n27 \nbe “a twisted result” to allow to an agency to avoid system-wide class action litigation “that challenges the \nconstitutionality of its general practices” by pointing to a few exceptions to the general pattern of violation of \n28 \nconstitutional and statutory mandates.  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046.   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 33 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 41 of 47\n \n1  Constant change is a way of life for all class members; many foster children in Clark County \n2  experience high numbers of placements while in foster care.  See supra Part III.A.4.  This fact, \n3  combined with the evidence of the unfortunate prevalence of abuse and neglect in foster homes in \n4  Clark County (see supra Part III.A.2), means that while an individual child may currently be in a \n5  home where she is not being abused or neglected, she is always at risk of being moved to an \n6  unsafe placement.  Similarly, while a particular foster child may not currently require \n7  psychological services, she may well require and be denied such services in the future.  As long \n8  as DFS fails to follow up on reports of abuse and neglect, as long as caseloads remain \n9  “dangerously high,” as long as children are not visited regularly, as long as DFS fails to provide \n10  foster parents with critical information about the children in their care – and the list goes on – \n11  every child remains at serious risk of harm.   \n12  b.  Commonality Exists Where Class Members Have Experienced \nDifferent Types of Harm as a Result of Defendants’ Common \n13  Course of Conduct.   \n14  It is not a barrier to class certification that individual class members have experienced \n15  different types of harm as a result of Defendants’ unconstitutional and unlawful patterns and \n16  practices.  See Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57 (citing Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1976)) \n17  (neither a child’s specific circumstances nor her individualized injuries can defeat commonality).  \n18  Nor will plaintiff children’s individual need for varied, specific services affect their ability to \n19  satisfy the commonality requirement.  The Ninth Circuit has clearly held that a class comprised of \n20  members with varying needs and factual circumstances is able to satisfy commonality. Armstrong \n21  v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001).  In Armstrong v. Davis, a class of prisoners and \n22  parolees with a range of physical and mental disabilities, requiring a range of services, sought \n23  certification.  Citing with approval Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994), the \n24  Armstrong court concluded that those factual disparities would not preclude a finding of \n25  commonality.  Id.  Rather, the common issue was defendants’ failure to consistently \n26  accommodate plaintiffs’ various disabilities.  Id.  The variation in plaintiffs’ needs and injuries \n27  was not the focus in determining commonality; what mattered was that they were all affected by \n28  defendants’ system-wide practices and policies. \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 34 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 42 of 47\n \n1  Here, plaintiff foster children have experienced a variety of harms (see supra Part III.A.) \n2  and have a range of needs according to their individual circumstances, but all suffer as a result of \n3  Defendants’ unconstitutional and unlawful practices (see supra Part III.B.).  A foster child who is \n4  beaten in a foster home is trapped in the same failing child welfare system as is a teenager in \n5  foster care who is denied necessary prescription medication for her psychiatric disorder – \n6  injunctive relief to address Defendants’ constitutional and statutory violations as alleged in the \n7  complaint will address both of their needs.   \n8  The evidence presented in this motion proves that all plaintiffs are being harmed or put at \n9  risk of harm by Defendants’ unconstitutional and unlawful practices, clearly satisfying the \n10  requirement of commonality.   \n11  C.  THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS SATISFY TYPICALITY.  \n12  Rule 23(a)(3) requires the named plaintiffs to demonstrate that their claims are typical of \n13  the class members’ claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The purpose of this requirement is to \n14  “assure that the interest of the named representative[s] aligns with the interests of the class.”  \n15  Hanon v. Dataproducts, 976 F.2d at 508 (citation omitted).  To demonstrate “typicality,” the \n16  named plaintiffs’ claims must arise from a course of conduct “not unique to the named plaintiffs” \n17  that has resulted in similar injury to other class members.  Id.  As with the commonality \n18  requirement, the typicality requirement is interpreted permissively by the Ninth Circuit.  Hanlon \n19  v. Chrysler, 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1997).  The evidence submitted with this Motion \n20  clearly demonstrates that the course of conduct leading to the named plaintiffs’ injuries was not \n21  unique to them, nor was it the result of an isolated group of caseworkers ignoring sound policies.  \n22  Rather, plaintiffs’ harms result from pervasive system-wide practices.      \n23  Although stated separately, Rule 23’s typicality and commonality requirements tend to \n24  merge.  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 n.13 (1982).  Both factors serve as \n25  guideposts for ensuring that a class action is economical and that the interests of the class \n26  members will be fairly and adequately protected.  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d at 868, citing \n27  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F. 3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. 1997).  A finding of commonality thus \n28  frequently confirms typicality.  Doe v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 48 F. Supp. 2d 1233, 1245 \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 35 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 43 of 47\n \n1  (C.D. Cal. 1999).  Particularly where, as here, “the challenged conduct is a policy or practice that \n2  affects all class members, the underlying issue presented with respect to typicality is similar to \n3  that presented with respect to commonality, although the emphasis may be different.”  Armstrong, \n4  275 F.3d at 868-69.  Here, the harms and risks of harm asserted by the named plaintiffs arise from \n5  a common course of conduct by Defendants, and are clearly – and sadly – typical of those \n6  experienced by the class as a whole. \n7  Typicality is satisfied when the claims of the class representatives and the proposed class \n8  rest on similar legal theories; if the claims are “reasonably co-extensive.”  See Armstrong, 275 \n9  F.3d at 868; Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1997)(“representative \n10  claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members”); \n11  Schaefer v. Overland Express Family of Funds, 169 F.R.D. 124, 128 (S.D. Cal. 1996)(named \n12  plaintiffs’ claims should be “based on the same legal theories that would be generally relied upon \n13  by the class”).  Courts have found typicality to be satisfied in cases where plaintiffs have suffered \n14  the deprivation of services or have failed to receive the full benefit of services to which they are \n15  entitled by statute, and suffered the violation of their constitutional rights.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d  \n16  at 869; Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58. \n17  As with the commonality inquiry, variations in the specific factual circumstances of the \n18  named plaintiffs will not defeat a finding of typicality.  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F. 2d \n19  497, 509 (9th Cir. 1992)(test for typicality is whether other class members have been injured by \n20  the same course of conduct); Baby Neal, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1994)(“factual differences will \n21  not render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice or course of \n22  conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and if it is based on the same legal \n23  theory”(citation omitted)).  Hence, typicality does not require that the named plaintiffs’ injuries \n24  are identical to those of other class members, only that they are similar and result from the same \n25  course of conduct.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 869, citing Hanon v. Dataproducts, 976 F.2d 497, 508 \n26  (9th Cir. 1992); Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157-159 (named plaintiffs \n27  suffering one specific injury from a common practice can represent class members that have \n28  suffered different injuries, as long as they can show that the injuries result from the common \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 36 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 44 of 47\n \n1  practice).  \n2  Plaintiff foster children’s claims arise from a course of conduct not at all unique to them, \n3  but to which they are subject only by virtue of their membership in the larger class of children in \n4  foster care in Clark County.  They allege that they have been harmed or put at risk of harm due to \n5  the operation of a child welfare system that violates the federal and state constitutions and state \n6  and federal laws.  Defendants have failed to provide a full range of services to which plaintiff \n7  foster children are entitled, including but not limited to, timely visits from child welfare workers, \n8  sufficient training for case workers responsible for plaintiff children’s safety, proper child abuse \n9  and neglect investigations, mental and physical health services, and an advocate to represent their \n10  needs at court hearings, among many other services.  See infra Part III.B.  \n11  The named plaintiffs’ claims go far beyond the permissive requirement that they be \n12  “reasonably co-extensive” with those of absent class members.  Here, the named plaintiffs’ claims \n13  are one and the same as those of the absent class members, based on Defendants’ common course \n14  of conduct, making their interests fully aligned.  Plaintiffs clearly fulfill the requirement of \n15  typicality. \n16  D.  PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL AND CLASS REPRESENTATIVES SERVE AS \nFAIR AND ADEQUATE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CLASS.   \n17 \n18  Rule 23(a)’s final prong requires that named plaintiffs display the ability and willingness \n19  to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Rule 23(a)(4).  Here, plaintiffs’ \n20  collective interest in reforming Defendants’ foster care system and representation by experienced \n21  class counsel ensure that named plaintiffs will zealously guard and pursue the interests of the \n22  class at every stage of the case. \n23  Rule 23(a)(4) seeks to ensure that the proposed class representatives can fairly and \n24  adequately protect the interests of the class.  This factor requires: (1) that the named plaintiffs do \n25  not have any conflicts of interest with the proposed class and (2) that plaintiffs are represented by \n26  qualified and competent counsel.  Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2007), citing \n27  Hanlon v. Chrysler, 150 F.3d at 1020; see also Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc. 582 F.2d \n28  507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978).   \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 37 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 45 of 47\n \n1  The named plaintiffs have already established their compelling joint interests in forcefully \n2  pursuing their co-extensive remedial and legal theories.  See supra Part IV.C.44  With the single \n3  objective of ending the widespread violation of their legal rights through injunctive and \n4  declaratory relief, class members harbor no internal animosity.  See Stolz v. United Brotherhood \n5  of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 620 F.Supp. 396, 405 (D.C. Nev. 1985)(plaintiffs’ aim of \n6  remedying statutory violations of class member rights inherently removed threat of antagonism); \n7  See also Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 63 (3rd Cir. 1994)(in suit seeking only declaratory and \n8  injunctive relief, “[t]here is no danger here that named plaintiffs have unique interests that might \n9  motivate them to litigate against or settle with the defendants in a way that prejudices the \n10  absentees”).  Additionally, the non-existence of any individual claims for damages removes any \n11  possibility of internal conflict between class members over the amount of individual damages.  \n12  Here, all plaintiffs raise the same claims, seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief that will \n13  benefit them equally – named plaintiffs will adequately represent the interests of the absent class \n14  members.   \n15  Plaintiffs’ counsel has the qualifications, experience, and general capability to conduct the \n16  litigation and vigorously pursue plaintiffs’ claims.  Lead counsel is the National Center for Youth \n17  Law, a privately-funded, non-profit organization with award-winning attorneys who have \n18  extensive state and federal court experience litigating complex class action child welfare reform \n19  suits.  See generally Grimm Decl. at ¶¶ 2-8.  The Las Vegas offices of Wolfenzon Schulman & \n20  Ryan and the San Francisco law firm of Farella Braun & Martel also represent plaintiffs.  \n21  Together these firms bring sophistication in resolving and litigating a broad range of high-stakes \n22  actions.  Declaration of Gregory M. Schulman (“Schulman Decl.”) at ¶¶ 4-6; Declaration of \n23  Katina Ancar (“Ancar Decl.”) at ¶¶ 3, 5.   \n24  Counsel have knowledge of state and federal child welfare laws and have represented \n                                                 \n25 \n44 Coextensiveness of the interests of the named plaintiffs with those of the rest of the class is properly understood as \n26  both an aspect of the typicality inquiry of 23(a)(3), and also functioning “as a further demonstration of a lack of \nadversity or antagonism between the named and unnamed members of the class for purposes of testing the adequacy \n27  of the representation” under 23(a)(4).  7A Wright & Miller Federal Practice & Procedure § 1769.  Here, the fact that \nnamed plaintiffs’ claims are coextensive with the claims of the proposed class supports a finding that named \n28  plaintiffs will adequately represent the interests of the class as a whole. \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 38 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 46 of 47\n \n1  plaintiffs in certified class action litigation.  Ancar Decl. at ¶ 4.  Collectively, plaintiffs’ attorneys \n2  bring more than 50 years of legal practice, covering the full range of civil litigation from initiation \n3  of the action to trial representation.  Grimm Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3, 7-8; Schulman Decl. at ¶¶ 2, 4; Ancar \n4  Decl. at ¶¶ 2, 5-6.  Plaintiffs’ legal representatives have the resources, expertise, and experience \n5  to meet the test for highly-competent class counsel.  Further, plaintiffs’ counsel has demonstrated \n6  that they will vigorously pursue this action.     \n7  V.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLASS IS A MODEL ACTION FOR RULE 23(B)(2) \nCERTIFICATION.   \n8 \n9  Plaintiffs also assert that the class may be properly maintained under the second category \n10  of Rule 23(b).  Rule 23(b)(2) certification is proper if \n11  the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \n12  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to \nthe class as a whole. \n13 \n14  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047.  Closely linked to the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality prerequisite, actions \n15  seeking injunctive relief to remedy violations of civil and constitutional rights easily satisfy \n16  23(b)(2).  These suits “are precisely the sort . . . that Rule 23(b)(2) was designed to facilitate.”  \n17  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046-47 (plaintiff class challenged constitutionality of the INS’s official \n18  forms and procedures); Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23 Advisory Committee Notes 1966 Amendment (civil \n19  rights actions requiring final injunctive relief “illustrative” of actions suitable for this category). \n20  Rule 23(b)(2) focuses solely on the actions of the defendants.  See Stolz, 620 F.Supp. at \n21  407 (initial inquiry is “whether the defendants have allegedly acted on grounds generally \n22  applicable to the entire class.  If this is the case, then injunctive relief is appropriate and necessary \n23  to remedy the wrong…”).  In order to meet the requirements of 23(b)(2), class members must \n24  simply “complain of a pattern or practice that is generally applicable to the class as a whole.”  \n25  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998).  Because the focus is not on the individual \n26  class members, “[e]ven if some class members have not been injured by the challenged practice, a \n27  class may nevertheless be appropriate.”  Id.   \n28  Plaintiffs’ proposed class is perfectly suited for certification under subdivision (b)(2).  \nFarella Braun & Martel LLP  PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR CLASS \n235 Montgomery Street, 17th Floor  - 39 -   \nSan Francisco, CA  94104  CERTIFICATION AND MPA  21433\\1372511.8\n(415) 954-4400 \nCASENO.2:06-CV-01068RCJ-RJJ\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 195   Filed 03/28/08   Page 47 of 47\n \n1  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ unitary course of conduct deprives each class member of the \n2  right to receive essential protections and services, violating both constitutional and statutory law.   \n3  VI.  CONCLUSION \n4  Many foster children have already suffered serious harm while in Clark County's custody.  \n5  Given the dismal failures of Defendants' system, all children entering care face the risk of similar \n6  harms – unsafe living conditions, physical abuse, neglect, and, worst of all, death.  The interests \n7  of justice require the Court to permit this case to proceed as a class action to redress the harms  \n8  suffered day after day by thousands of class members.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the \n9  Court grant their renewed motion for class certification. \n10   \n11  Dated:  March 28, 2008 \n12  WOLFENZON SCHULMAN   NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW \n   \n13     \n/s/ Bruno Wolfenzon      /s/ William Grimm     \n14  BRUNO WOLFENZON, ESQ.

INTRODUCTION \n2  After four years of hard-fought litigation, the parties have reached a settlement to resolve \n3  all of Plaintiffs' claims as to the alleged harms they suffered in Clark County foster care, \n4  including any claims for attorneys' fees and costs. Under the settlement, the four minor Plaintiffs \n5  and three adult Plaintiffs are to receive a cumulative total of$1,575,0001  Additionally, Clark \n6  County Defendants2 will pay attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of$500,000, which will not \n7  be deducted from Plaintiffs' awards.  The Clark County Board of County Commissioners \n8  approved the parties' settlement at a public hearing on November 18, 2014, and Plaintiffs' \n9  Petition to Approve Compromise Settlement and Distribution (\"Petition\") was filed under seal \n10  with this Court on November 21,2014 (Dkt. 386) and approved on January 9, 2015 (Dkt. 400). \n11  Plaintiffs and Clark County Defendants now petition this Court for approval of the \n12  negotiated fees and costs settlement pursuant to 42 U.S. C. Section 1988.  As demonstrated \n13  below, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their fees and costs, and the amount negotiated is fair and \n14  reasonable.  The settlement amount does not come close to compensating Plaintiffs' counsel for \n15  the more than 17,000 hours of work expended on this case along with the roughly $306,439.06 \n16  they have spent out-of-pocket.  There is a strong presumption that the lodestar method results in a \n17  reasonable fee, Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U.S. 542,552-53 (2010), and the compromise of \n18  $500,000 in fees represents less than 15 percent of Plaintiffs' counsel's lodestar, which is \n19  $3,355,260.50?  The negotiated fees and costs also amount to less than 25 percent of the total \n20  settlement amount, and Plaintiffs' counsel have waived their right to recover any contingency fee \n21 \n1 The Plaintiffs' original complaint named thirteen Plaintiffs, but seven currently have claims \n22  pending before this court.  See Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint.  Dkt. 178, Dkt. 245. \n(Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice of the Actions ofMaizy and Jonathan D., \n23  Christine F., and Olivia G.\") \n24  2 Clark County Defendants are all Defendants remaining in the case:  Clark County, Don \nBurnette, Virginia Valentine, Tom Morton, Lisa Ruiz-Lee, Sylvia Clark, Teresa Cragon, Darrell \n25  Ford, Patricia Martin, Thor Martinez, Philomena Osemwengie, Stacey Scott, and Sonya \nWeathers, represented by Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, and Yvette Chevalier and \n26  Debbie Mallwitz, represented by Kolesar and Leatham. \n27  3 The \"lodestar\" is calculated as the hours reasonably worked multiplied by the reasonable hourly \nrate. \n28 \n4826-8585-0145.1 PET. & MEM.

FACTUALANDPROCEDURALBACKGROUND \n3  Plaintiffs are former foster children who were in the custody of Clark County's \n4  Department of Family Services (\"DFS\").  They filed suit on Aprill3, 2010, seeking redress for \n5  alleged harms suffered while in foster care.4  They sued for violations of their federal \n6  constitutional and statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, as well as for violations of \n7  Nevada state law.  SAC~~ 198-281. \n8  Following four years of litigation, seven Plaintiffs remain in the case, four of whom are \n9  minors.  A brief summary of the minor Plaintiffs' claims in the SAC are as follows: \n10  Henry A.:  Henry was seven years old when he first came into Clark County custody, and \nhe remained in foster care from November 2005 until February 2013.  During this time he \n11  suffered numerous alleged harms.  For instance, when he was eleven years old, Henry \nsuffered near organ failure allegedly as a result of a medication regimen that involved \n12  multiple psychotropic medications.  He was allegedly hospitalized twice in the intensive \ncare unit and allegedly nearly died.  The parties have agreed to settle Henry's claims for \n13  $325,000. \n14  Charles & Charlotte B.:  Charles and Charlotte are siblings who entered Clark County \nfoster care at eight years old and three months old, respectively.  They were in care for \n15  approximately two years, from March 2009 to March 2011.  In the very first foster home \ninto which they were placed, Charlotte, an infant, was allegedly locked in a closet and left \n16  unattended, and Charles was allegedly beaten with a plastic baseball bat when he tried to \nhelp her.  The foster mother and her son were convicted of child abuse, and Charlotte was \n17  allegedly hospitalized for several days due to her injuries.  The parties have agreed to \nsettle Charles's claims for $150,000 and Charlotte's claims for $100,000. \n18 \nMason I.:  Clark County DFS took Mason into custody when he was five years old.  He \n19  remained in care for over ten years, until September 2013.  When he was ten years old, \nDFS sent Mason to Florida to an institution for deaf individuals.

After the Court granted the initial \n3  motions to dismiss in October 2010, Plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed in \n4  part and remanded the case.  Based on the motion to dismiss rulings and the appeal, Plaintiffs \n5  amended their complaint twice.5 \n6  The discovery that began in the summer of2010 and re-commenced in the fall of2012 \n7  was protracted and hard fought and filled with motion practice by Plaintiffs and Defendants. \n8  Plaintiffs took nearly forty depositions, and County Defendants deposed all but one Plaintiff in \n9  addition to taking six other depositions.

B. \n2  III.  DISCUSSION \n3  A.  Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Attorneys' Fees and Costs Under 42 U.S. C. \nSection 1988 and Under the Parties' Settlement Agreement. \n4 \n5  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1988, courts have authority to award attorneys' fees in \n6  actions brought under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.  The Ninth Circuit has interpreted this statute to \n7  mean that \"a court's discretion to deny fees under Section 1988 is very narrow and ... fee awards \n8  should be the rule rather than the exception.\"  Mendez v. Cnty. ofS an Bernardino, 540 F.3d 1109, \n9  1126 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Herrington v.  Cnty. ofS onoma, 883 F.2d 739, 743 (9th Cir. 1989)). \nI 0  This interpretation supports Congress's intent that Section 1988 \"provide many victims of civil \n11  rights violations with effective access to the judicial process.\" See City ofR  iverside v. Rivera, \n12  477 U.S. 561, 576 (1986). \n13  Through this settlement Plaintiffs are the prevailing party for purposes of recovering their \n14  reasonable fees and costs.  The parties entered into a settlement providing for payments to each \n15  Plaintiff and for payment to Plaintiffs' counsel of an agreed amount for fees and costs under \n16  Section 1988.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, payment ofthe negotiated fees and costs will \n17  be made directly to Plaintiffs' counsel and will not be deducted from any individual Plaintiffs \n18  settlement amount. \n19  B.  The Parties' Settlement Agreement Is Fair and Reasonable. \n20  Settlements involving minors require the court to play an oversight role \"to determine \n21  whether the settlement serves the best interests of the minor.\"  Robidoux v. Rosengren, 638 F.3d \n22  1177, 1181 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  The court's inquiry, however, should not \n23  \"place[]. .. undue emphasis on the amount of attorney's fees provided for in a settlement ....\"  \n24  !d.  The Ninth Circuit has clarified that when reviewing a settlement agreement involving minor \n25  plaintiffs, \"[m]ost importantly, the district court should evaluate the fairness of each minor \n26  plaintiffs net recovery without regard to the proportion of the total settlement value designated \n27 \n28 \n4826·8585·0145.1 PET. & MEM. fN SUPP.

Mendoza, 573 F.2d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir. 1978)).7 \n3  In Robidoux, the Ninth Circuit reversed where the court below looked to state law in \n4  reviewing the minors' settlement.  638 F.3d at 1182.  The district court had rejected the proposed \n5  settlement because it allowed for 56 percent of the total settlement to go toward attorney's fees \n6  and the practice in state court was to award attorneys a maximum of25 percent of the settlement. \n7  !d. at 1179-80.  In reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that \"[s ] o long as the net recovery to each \n8  minor plaintiff is fair and reasonable in light of their claims and average recovery in similar cases, \n9  the district court should approve the settlement as proposed by the parties.\"  !d. at 1182. \n10  Here, the net amounts· to the minor Plaintiffs are fair and reasonable.  Each will receive \n11  between $100,000 and $350,000, with no deduction for attorneys' fees or costs.  Petition at 3, 4. \n12  These awards match or exceed settlements that courts have approved in other litigation where \n13  foster children sued Clark County Department of Family Services for harms suffered while in \n14  County custody.  See, e.g., Order on Petition for Compromise of Minors' Claims with Clark \n15  County, 4, Fullmer v. Brown, No. 2:09-cv-01442-BES-PAL (D. Nev. Dec. 7, 2011) (approving \n16  net awards of$20,000; $30,000; and $100,000 to minor plaintiffs); Order at 3, Johnson v. \n17  Clayton, No. 2:08-cv-01810-RCJ-LRL (D. Nev. Dec. 28, 2010) (approving net awards of \n18  $36,769.17 and $33,407.09 to the two minor plaintiffs); Order on Amended Petition to Approve \n19  Compromise Settlement and Distribution at 4, Mix v. Jones-Johnson, No. 2:06-cv-411-RLH-LRL \n20  (D. Nev. Aug. 19, 2009) (approving net awards of$11,500; $34,500; and two awards of$92,000 \n21  to the four minor plaintiffs). \n22  Even if the Court were to look to the customary fee percentage taken from settlements of \n23  minors in Nevada, the fee proposal here--less than 25 percent of the total settlement amount-is \n24 \n25  7 Although the Robidoux court was silent as to whether its holding applied to cases involving \nfederal claims and pendant state law claims, numerous district courts have applied Robidoux in \n26  such cases.

Order at 2, Johnson v. Clayton (approving a \n2  settlement where 33 percent of the total award is made as payment for attorneys' fees); Order at \n3  6, Mix v. Jones-Johnson (approving settlement where 35 percent of the total award is designated \n4  as attorneys' fees). \n5  On November 21, 2014, Plaintiffs separately filed a petition for this Court's approval of \n6  the minors' settlement.  Plaintiffs outline below the reasonableness of the attorneys' fee \n7  settlement in an effort to assist the Court's inquiry into whether the overall settlement agreement \n8  is in the minors' best interests.  For the reasons set forth below, there can be no question that the \n9  fees and costs portion of the overall settlement is reasonable and should be approved along with \n10  the petition to approve the minors' compromise. \n11  c.  The Fees and Costs Agreed to by the Parties Are Reasonable. \n12  1.  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle for a significant reduction of their fee \nclaim. \n13 \n14  The Supreme Court explained in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,433 (1983), that the \n15  \"most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours \n16  reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\"  This figure, the \n17  \"lodestar,\" is the presumptive reasonable fee.  !d. at 433.  Once the lodestar is reached, the court \n18  may adjust it upward or downward based on the factors that the Ninth Circuit outlined in Kerr v. \n19  Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir. 1975).  Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lake \n20  Elsinore 521, LLC, No. 2:11-cv-00386-GMN-LRL, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126866, **6-7 \n21  (D. Nev. Nov. 1, 2011) (explaining that \"[c]alculation of reasonable attorney's fees is a two-step \n22  process\" consisting of first calculating the lodestar and second examining the award in light of the \n23  Kerr factors); see also LR 54-16(b)(3). \n24  Here, Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claim for attorneys' fees and costs for a fraction \n25  of the full amount to which their counsel are entitled based on the lodestar calculation.  To \n26  achieve the results in this case--obtaining payment of over $1.5 million to their clients-\n27  Plaintiffs' counsel expended 17,480.20 hours of compensable time.  Danis Dec!.~ 12; Welch \n28  Dec!.~ 13; Wolfenzon Dec!.~ 5.  This equates to a lodestar of$3,355,260.50 at reasonable hourly \n4826-8585-0145.1 PET. & MEM. IN SUPP. OF PET.

Danis Dec!.~ 12; Welch Dec!.~ 13; Wolfenzon Dec!.~ 5.  The \n2  fees and costs settlement also constitutes less than 25 percent of the total recovery in the case, far \n3  below what courts in Nevada have held to be reasonable percentages when taken as a contingency \n4  fee. 8  See § III(B), supra. \n5  Complete time records and hourly rate information are attached as exhibits to the \n6  declarations in support of this Petition.9  A summary of Plaintiffs' counsel's hourly rates, hours \n7  worked, and total lodestar is as follows: \n8  Law Firm  Rate Range (NV)  Hours  Lodestar \n9  Morrison & Foerster LLP  $100-$250  12,273.00  $2,391,422.50 \n10  Nat'!

For purposes of this case, Plaintiffs' counsel have calculated their lodestar using \n14  reasonable hourly rates charged for similar work in the Clark County legal market.  These rates \n15  range from $200 per hour for a junior associate with 0-3 years of experience to $250 per hour for \n16  a senior partner.

Welch Dec!.~ 18. \nThese agreements permit Plaintiffs' counsel to receive 25 percent of the clients' recovery if the \n23  case settles pre-trial and counsel does not recover from the defendants at least 75 percent of its \nattorneys' fees and out-of-pocket expenses.  Id.  Plaintiffs' counsel will not, however, be taking \n24  any payment from the clients.  Id. \n9 Plaintiffs attach detailed billing summaries for Morrison & Foerster LLP, the National Center \n25  for Youth Law, and Wolfenzon Rolle to the declarations filed in support of this petition.

Even so, rather than seeking an enhancement of their lodestar, Plaintiffs have taken a \n2  significant reduction in the amount to which they are legally entitled, making approval of the \n3  negotiated fee settlement all the more reasonable. \n4  A.  The Results Obtained and the Amount Involved:  Plaintiffs in this case have settled \n5  their claims for a total of$1.575 million, with each individual award ranging from $100,000 to \n6  $350,000.  Petition at 3.  The settlement amounts for the minor Plaintiffs substantially exceed \n7  settlements in other litigation by former foster children against Clark County Department of \n8  Family Services.  See § III(B ), supra (citing cases in which settlement awards to minors ranged \n9  from $20,000 to $1 00,000). \n10  Plaintiffs could not have achieved this result without significant expenditure of attorney \n11  time and resources, as demonstrated by Plaintiffs' counsel's lodestar, which totals $3,355,260.50 \n12  at rates typically charged in the Clark County legal market.  § III(B)(l ), supra.  Plaintiffs have \n13  substantially achieved the goals of the lawsuit by winning significant monetary damages for the \n14  harms they allegedly suffered while in foster care. 12 \n15  B.  The Time and Labor Required:  Plaintiffs' counsel have worked over 17,000 hours \n16  spanning more than a four-year period to achieve the results in this case.  Danis Dec!.~ 12; Welch \n17  Dec!.~ 13; Wilson Dec!.~ 3; Wolfenzon Dec!.~~ 4, 5.  Plaintiffs' counsel engaged in intensive \n18  litigation activities, as demonstrated by the 400-plus docket entries to date.  Further, the fee award \n19  the parties have negotiated is intended to cover Plaintiffs' significant litigation costs and out-of-\n20  pocket expenses, which total $306,439.06.  § III(C)(3), infra.  These fees and costs were incurred \n21  in the course of such activities as taking and defending roughly 50 depositions; hiring four experts \n22  to review case files, interview Plaintiffs, and write expert reports; and engaging in extensive \n23  motion practice during discovery proceedings.  !d.; § II, supra. \n24 \n12 Although Plaintiffs did not achieve complete relief because they were unable to obtain an \n25  injunction, a further reduction of their lodestar is not warranted because the parties' settlement \ntakes into account the level of success achieved.  This settlement recognizes that Plaintiffs have \n26  achieved excellent results.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435 (\"Where a plaintiff has obtained \nexcellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee\").  If any reduction of the \n27  lodestar is warranted, it is more than accounted for by the more than 85 percent reduction that the \nparties have negotiated. \n28 \n4826-8585-0145.1 PET. & MEM.

Section 1983 constitutes \"complex \n3  Federal litigation\" on par with antitrust litigation.  Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 893 (1984).  As \n4  Plaintiffs brought suit under Section 1983, they have met the prong of demonstrating that their \n5  lawsuit presents novel and difficult legal questions.  See SAC~~ 198-227, 276-281. \n6  D.  The Skill Requisite To Perform the Legal Service Properly:  This case required \n7  specialized skill spanning a variety of practice areas, ranging from litigation of federal civil rights \n8  suits, to expertise in child welfare systems, to expertise in personal injury and emotional trauma \n9  resulting from alleged abuse in foster care.  The significant discovery in which the parties \n10  engaged required the ability to manage and examine tens of thousands of documents related to \n11  County Defendants' child welfare agency.  Danis Dec!.~ 6.  Plaintiffs' counsel Morrison & \n12  Foerster contributed its expertise in complex federal litigation and in discovery management. \n13  Danis Dec!. ~ 2.  The National Center for Youth Law additionally contributed its significant \n14  specialized knowledge of foster care systems and its expertise representing low-income children. \n15  Welch Dec!.~~ 2, 3, 9. \n16  E.  The Preclusion of Other Employment by the Attorney Due to Acceptance of the \n17  Case:  Generally speaking, counsel's decision to litigate a case necessarily precludes work on \n18  other cases.  See, e.g., Riker v. Gibbons, No. 3:08-cv-00115-LRH-VPC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n19  120841, at *27 (D. Nev. Oct. 28, 2010).  That is particularly so in this case, where Plaintiffs' \n20  counsel expended over 17,000 hours over the course of more than four years-all time in which \n21  Plaintiffs' counsel were limited in their ability to accept other employment as a result of time \n22  devoted to this suit. \n23  F.  The Customary Fee:  As addressed in section III(C)(1 ), supra, Plaintiffs' counsel \n24  have calculated their lodestar based on the rates customary to lawyers of comparable skill and \n25  experience for similarly complex litigation.  At the rates customarily charged by attorneys \n26  practicing in Clark County, Plaintiffs through their fee settlement are accepting an award that is \n27  less than 15 percent of the amount which they could reasonably claim.  Measured in a different \n28  way, the fees compromise amounts to less than 25 percent of the total recovery at issue, and is \n4826-8585-0145.1 PET. & MEM. lN SUPP. OF PET. FOR APPROVAL OF NEGOTIATED ATTORNEYS' FEES & COSTS \nCASE No. 2:10-CV-00528-RCJ-PAL \n11 \nsf-3490804 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00528-RCJ-PAL   Document 403   Filed 01/16/15   Page 17 of 21\n1  thus far less than the 33 and 35 percent contingency arrangements that courts in the District of \n2  Nevada have approved as appropriate in other cases involving minors.  See§ III(C)(l), supra. \n3  G.  Whether the Fee Is Fixed or Contingent:  Plaintiffs' counsel's ability to obtain fees \n4  was contingent on obtaining a successful outcome in this case.  Plaintiffs are former foster \n5  children and are generally indigent, and Plaintiffs' counsel advanced all the expenses of this \n6  litigation.  Danis Dec!. 'If 8; Welch Dec!. '1['1[ 10, 18. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs are not asking for a \n7  lodestar enhancement based on this factor and· have in fact agreed to accept much less than their \n8  full fees in the settlement of this case. \n9  H.  The Time Limitations Imposed by the Client or the Circumstances:  This case \n10  imposed significant time limitations due to the pace of the litigation and the fact that most of \n11  Plaintiffs' counsel had to travel from out of state in order to attend hearings or visit their clients. \n12  Even after the parties agreed to the settlement in principle, the complexity of settling damages \n13  claims involving large sums of money to Plaintiffs required an additional five months of research \n14  and negotiations before the parties were prepared to sign the Settlement Agreement and Release. \n15  Welch Dec!. 'If 16. \n16  I.  The Experience, Reputation, and Ability of the Attorneys:  The firms representing \n17  Plaintiffs are well known and respected throughout the legal communities in which they practice. \n18  See§ III(C)(2)(D), supra.  The two lead partners on the case from Morrison & Foerster have \n19  more than 60 years oflitigation experience combined.  Danis Dec!. '1['1[ 3, 4, Ex. A.  The two lead \n20  senior attorneys on this case from the National Center for Youth Law have nearly 60 years of \n21  litigation experience combined, almost exclusively in the arena of child welfare litigation.  Welch \n22  Dec!. '1['1[ 5, 7.  They have successfully represented children in foster care in suits across the \n23  country, including in Arkansas, Washington, and Utah.  Id.  Resumes for the primary attorneys on \n24  this case for each firm are attached to the Declarations of Mark Danis (Ex. A) and Leecia Welch \n25  (Ex. A). \n26  J.  The Undesirability of the Case:  For a number of reasons, this was an \n27  \"undesirable\" case for Plaintiffs' counsel to undertake.  The litigation was extremely time-\n28  consuming, complex, and expensive.  See §§ III(C)(2)(C), (D), supra; § III(C)(3), infra.  The \n4826-8585-0145.1 PET. & MEM. IN SUPP. OF PET.

Many of the \n2  Plaintiffs moved multiple times, and all of the Plaintiffs exited foster care during the course of \n3  this lawsuit.  All of the minor Plaintiffs now live outside of Nevada, in three different states, and \n4  Plaintiffs' counsel have had to navigate relevant laws in each of those states.  Welch Dec!.~ 16. \n5  Finally, Plaintiffs' counsel undertook this litigation without any payment from clients and with \n6  the knowledge that they might not recover their attorneys' fees or out-of-pocket expenditures. \n7  Danis Dec!.~ 14; Welch Dec!.~~ 10, 18. \n8  K.  The Nature and Length of the Professional Relationship with the Clients: \n9  Plaintiffs' counsel have long relationships with the Plaintiffs and/or with their Next Friends that \nI 0  date back to 2009 or earlier.  Welch Dec!. ~ 8.  Plaintiffs' counsel have traveled to four different \nII  states to visit the clients where they live.  !d.~ 9.  Plaintiffs' counsel have developed close \n12  relationships with each client, which is of special importance where the clients have been in foster \n13  care and have often experienced much instability in their relationships with the adults in their \n14  lives.  !d.~~ 8-9. \n15  L.  Awards in Similar Cases:  The negotiated attorneys' fee amount here is reasonable \n16  in light of fee awards in similar cases.  In other cases involving multi-year litigation where \n17  children sue public agencies for damages under Section 1983 based on alleged child abuse and \n18  neglect, courts have approved fee awards that far exceed the negotiated amount proposed here. \n19  See, e.g., Guerrero v. Brentwood Union Sch. Dist., No. 13-03873 LB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n20  47167, at **13-14 (N.D. Cal.

The fee settlement is reasonable in light of the substantial costs and \nout-of-pocket litigation expenses that Plaintiffs' counsel have \n2  expended. \n3  Since 2009, Plaintiffs' counsel have incurred significant costs and out-of-pocket litigation \n4  expenses in the prosecution of this case.  Danis Dec!. '1]8; Welch Dec!. '1]10.  \"Costs\" include \n5  those costs allowable under 28 U.S.C. Section 1920, as itemized in the Bill of Costs attached as \n6  exhibits to the Declarations of Mark Danis, Leecia Welch, and Bruno Wolfenzon.  \"Out-of-\n7  pocket litigation expenses\" include those expenses that are ordinarily charged to fee-paying \n8  clients and thus are recoverable as part of the overall attorneys' fees award.  Dang v. Cross, \n9  422 F.3d 800, 814 (9th Cir. 2005); Harris v. Marhoefer, 24 F.3d 16, 19 (9th Cir. 1994); see also \n10  Woods v. Carey, 722 F.3d 1177, 1179 n.1 (9th Cir. 2013) (\"Expenses normally charged to fee-\n11  paying clients include 'photocopying, paralegal expenses, and travel and telephone costs.'\") \n12  (quoting Thornberry v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 676 F.2d 1240, 1244 (9th Cir.1982)). \n13  In total, Plaintiffs' counsel have incurred $124,064.84 in costs, including photocopying \n14  and hearing and deposition transcript charges, which are recoverable as a part of Plaintiffs' fees \n15  and costs award.  Additionally, Plaintiffs' counsel have incurred $182,374.22 in other out-of-\n16  pocket litigation expenses that were necessary and reasonable for representation, including travel \n17  for depositions and court appearances, long-distance telephone costs, postage, and expert fees.13 \n18  A summary of the expenditures is below. \n19  Plaintiffs' counsel is not seeking separate reimbursement of these amounts, and out-of-\n20  pocket litigation expenses and costs will be paid out of the negotiated fees and costs award. \n21  Welch Dec!.; Petition at 4. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n13 Plaintiffs' counsel have excluded from their calculation the following out-of-pocket \n26  expenditures: Lexis/Westlaw research costs; secretarial overtime; word processing costs; and, for \nMorrison & Foerster, travel costs.  Danis Dec!. '1]8; Welch Dec!. '1]11.  Alverson Taylor \n27  Mortensen & Sanders has also advanced costs and expenses for which it does not seek \nreimbursement.  Wilson Dec!.

CONCLUSION \n7  Plaintiffs have achieved significant results in this case, having reached a settlement of \n8  $1.575 million for the four children and three adult Plaintiffs.  To reach a complete settlement of \n9  the case, the parties agreed to a negotiated compromise of$500,000 in attorneys' fees and costs, \n10  which will not come out of Plaintiffs' recovery.  The amount that Plaintiffs' counsel will receive \n11  under the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable, and constitutes less than 25 percent of the \n12  total settlement.  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \n13  approve the parties' negotiated compromise of attorneys' fees and costs, to be paid as described \n14  in the Settlement Agreement and Release. \n15  Dated:  January 16,2015  By:  /41  H~O~ \nMark W.

This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought by ten children on behalf of all \n13  abused and neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care \n14  system.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel Nevada and Clark County \n15  officials to meet their legal duties under federal and state law to protect and care for abused and \n6 \n7  18.  were  or  m \n18  Clark County.  During the same year, 4,548 children entered foster care.  There are currently over \nl9  3,600 children in the legal custody of Clark County placed in foster family homes, group homes, \n20  unlicensed and/or unpaid relative homes, and other settings. \n21  19.  Until2004, Nevada operated a bifurcated child welfare system in which the state's \n22  two counties with populations of over 100,000-Clark and Washoe Counties  were responsible \n23  for providing child protective services, while the State bore responsibility for providing foster \n24  care services.  As a result of AB 1, passed by the Nevada State Legislature in 200 I, responsibility \nfor both child protective services and foster care were vested  Clark and Washoe Counties. \nThe State retained responsibility for supervision and oversight  Clark and Washoe Counties' \nprograms to ensure, among other things, compliance  state laws, \n''-'i\",'-\"<'uv \n28 \n-6 - 21433\\1094304, I \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED; \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 57   Filed 10/19/06   Page 7 of 11\nstandards.  The transfer of foster care staff and services from the State to Clark County was \n2  completed in October 2004. \n3  20.  Clark County's child welfare system is in crisis.  Virtually every aspect of the \n4  County's child protective services and foster care system is failing the children and youth it is \n5  charged with protecting.  The County's child welfare system denies children their rights under the \n6  Federal and State Constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, and accepted professional standards. \n7  21.  The County and State's failures have resulted in harm to an untold number of \n8  children.  A recent state report indicates that within the last four years at least 79 children have \n9  died from abuse or neglect.  These victims of fatal injuries or neglect include children in foster \n10  care and children left at home following a substantiated report of abuse.  Many of their deaths \n11  were preventable. \n12  22.  Within the past two and a half years, one study after another has documented Clark \n13  County's failure to protect the health, safety, and well-being of child abuse victims and children \n14  in foster care.  Defendants have had full knowledge of these studies, and have nonetheless failed \n15  to take adequate steps to address the long-standing problems identified in them.  These studies \n16  include: \n18  part of the preparation for the February 2004 federal Child and Family Services \n19  Review (\"CFSR\"); \n20  0  A February 2004 federal CFSR of Nevada's child welfare system that included an \n21  audit of Clark County's system (\"2004 Federal Review\"); \n22  0  An April 2004 Audit of Child Haven and the Clark County Shelter Home Program \n23  conducted by the Audit Department of Clark County; \n24  0  An April 2005 Report to the Clark County Commissioners on the Status of Child \no  June 2005 report of a review of child abuse fatalities  Clark County conducted \nby  Welfare Institute  Morton was  director; \n28  0  An October 2005 case review of Clark County child abuse and foster care cases \n-7-\n21433\\1094304. \nFIRST AMENDED CO:\\iPLAINT (CLASS ACTIO'\\ ALLEGED) \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 57   Filed 10/19/06   Page 8 of 11\n1  conducted by State DCFS (\"2005 County Case Review\"); and \n2  0  An April 2006 Report of the Findings and Recommendations: Child Deaths 2001-\n3  2004 describing the results of an independent child death review panel \n4  investigation of deaths related to child abuse or neglect in Clark County (\"2006 \n5  Child Fatality Report\"). \n6  23.  During July 2006, representatives of the Administration for Children and Families \n7  of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"Federal DHHS\") conducted a \n8  site visit to reassess Clark County's child welfare program.  Federal officials concluded that the \n9  situation for children and families served by Clark County's child welfare system \"has worsened\" \n10  since officials' earlier on-site visit in Febmary 2004.  Some of the specific deficiencies reported \n11  by federal officials include: \n12  0  The State's acquiescence in Clark County's continued use of an unlicensed \n13  congregate care facility- Child Haven; \n14  0  Consistent overcrowding at Child Haven; \n15  0  Unnecessary removal of children from their homes due to Clark County's failure \n16  to provide an adequate array of services to prevent placement; \n7  0  care; \n18  0  Inadequate assessments of the safety of suspected victims of child abuse and \n19  neglect; \n20  0  Inadequate training of staff and insufficient recruitment of foster parents; \n21  0  Unanswered or lengthy delays in answering calls to the Child Abuse Hotline; \n22  0  The use of an invalid, ineffective risk assessment tool; \n23  0  The failure to use data to provide effective oversight and supervision; and \no  The failure to provide a guardian ad litem for every child in foster care. \n25  24.  In a  to Nevada child welfare officials on August 11, 2006, Sharon M. \n26  Regional Administrator for the Administration  and \n_, \n)'\"'  manner m  continuum of child welfare services is \n28  in Clark County should be a grave concern to the State.''

She notified state officials that the current Program Improvement \n2  Plan between the State and federal officials \"is no longer adequate to address the serious \n3  deficiencies in the State's child welfare program, most specifically Clark County which accounts \n4  for the majority of the State's child welfare population.\" /d. \n5  25.  Defendants Willden and Serrano subsequently wrote a letter to Defendant Morton \n6  warning him that: \n7  we continue to receive information indicating serious deficiencies \nwith the [child welfare] system ... ; the existing level of effort to \n8 \ncorrect system deficiencies is not adequate; [and] that despite lists \nof corrective action plans ... still we have major failures. \n9 \n10  August 30, 2006 Letter from Defendants Willden and Serrano to Defendant Morton. \n11  26.  For years, Clark County has evaded scrutiny of its child protective services and \n12  foster care programs.  It has hidden behind a veil of confidentiality meant to protect children and \n13  families, but which the County has used to shield itself from oversight and criticism. \n14  27.  Among other things, it has failed and continues to fail to comply with federal law \n15  requiring that it provide the public with findings and information concerning child abuse victims \n16  who have  or  information available to \nIS  out  most recent  on \n18  foster care is from 2004. \n19  28.  Nevada and its counties receive millions of dollars in federal funds for the \n20  provision of child welfare services and are therefore required to comply with federal mandates, \n21  including those set forth in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the Child Abuse \n22  Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment \n23  provisions of Medicaid law.  In state fiscal year 2004, Nevada spent over $79 million on child \n24  welfare services, of which $44 miliion was federal funds. \n25  29.  T~i'l.l S  also challenges the placement  children, and the conditions in which \n26  they are forced to  at Child Haven- an unlicensed child care institution operated by Clark \n27  County.  has not been a  and  placed \n28  Upon entering foster care  Clark County, children are placed at Child \n-9-\nFIRST AME;'\\JDED COMPLA!l\\T (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 57   Filed 10/19/06   Page 10 of 11\n1  there for as little as a few hours or as long as a year or more.  For years, unlike other facilities \n2  providing care to foster children in Nevada, Child Haven has been allowed to operate without \n3  meeting the minimum licensing standards required by state law.  The Child Haven facility houses \n4  infants and young children alongside teenagers, some of whom have significant behavioral \n5  problems and pose a risk of serious harm to the younger, more vulnerable children in the facility. \n6  Child Haven is frequently extremely overcrowded resulting in children sleeping on the floors and \n7  in gymnasiums, separated from their siblings and in conditions that have contributed to the spread \n8  of infectious disease at Child Haven.  Children's needs, particularly their need for mental health \n9  care, are not being met. \n10  30.  High caseloads and inadequate training of Clark County child protective services \n11  and foster care workers contribute to the crisis within the system.  Many workers' caseloads \n12  exceed those established by national standards.  Workers are ill prepared and supervised to \n13  perform a job in which failure to abide by law, regulations, and professional standards, and failure I \n14  to exercise professional judgment result in serious injury to or death of a child. \n15  31.  Investigations of child abuse reports  both those involving children in foster care \n16  and those  at  fail to comply with state law and  As a \n,,..., \nl I \n18  32.  Clark County DFS has failed to recruit and retain a sufficient number of foster \n19  homes, resulting in harm to children whose needs are mismatched with the foster parents' \n20  experience and abilities.  Placements are often made based solely upon whether or not there is an \n21  available bed in the foster home.  As a result, placements often break down, and children are \n22  shuttled from one house, group home, and institution to another.  Caseworkers fail to visit \n23  children in these placements, and, as a result, are unaware of the quality of care the child is \n24  receiving, the harm befalling the child, the risk to which the child is exposed, and the lack of \n26  Children in foster homes recruited, licensed, and supervised by Defendants are \n27  those homes.  are complaints about \n28  Clark County DFS often turns a deaf ear, allowing children to remain in dangerous homes that \nlA \n- IV- 2i433\\i094~104.! \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS A.CT!ON ALLEGED) \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 57   Filed 10/19/06   Page 11 of 11\n1  either should not have been licensed in the first place or should have had their license revoked. \n2  At the same time, Clark County DFS retaliates against foster parents who advocate for services \n3  for a child placed in their homes or who disagree with the department's plan for the child, driving \n4  out the very foster parents the system needs.  Clark County DFS also fails to provide foster \n5  parents with even the most basic background information about children they place in their homes \n6  and the supportive services needed. \n7  34.  Children entering foster care have many special needs - for medical and mental \n8  health care as well as educational and special educational services.  Clark County DFS fails to act \n9  as a responsible parent to children in its custody.  As a result, foster children's needs are not met \n10  and services are delayed or not provided at all, causing substantial harm to these children. \n11  35.  Children in foster care have no voice in the court proceedings where decisions are \n12  made that affect their basic safety, their temporary and permanent placement, and their general \n13  well-being.  Even though state and federal law mandate appointment of a representative to look \n14  out for the interests of the child in all cases, Clark County falls woefully short of meeting this \n15  requirement. \n16  36.  If Defendants' unconstitutional and unlawful  are not \n7  more  to \n18  State will suffer untold misery, some will die, and others will leave the foster care system ill \n19  prepared to live healthy, independent, and productive lives. \n20  IV. \n21  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n22  37.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n23  23(b )(2).

Although defendants collectively bear \n7  the responsibility of assessing, protecting, and providing for the needs of foster children, they \n8  have overwhelmingly shirked these duties.  For years, Clark County’s abused and neglected \n9  children have been placed in an unlicensed shelter facility from which they are replaced into \n10  foster homes that are inadequately screened, supported, and supervised.  While in foster care, they \n11  are deprived of necessary medical and mental health care, their special needs go unattended, and \n12  their prospects for the future worsen rather than improve.  Others are left in abusive homes to be \n13  revictimized,  unnecessarily removed from homes in which reasonable efforts could safely sustain \n14  and protect the child, and returned to homes where their health and safety is endangered and re-\n15  abuse frequently occurs. \n16  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), plaintiffs seek to represent \n17  a county-wide class consisting of all children \n18  who have been, are, or will be victims of child abuse and neglect, \nand who have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of Clark \n19  County Department of Family Services (“DFS”).   \n20  First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶ 37. \n21  Prosecution of this litigation as a class action is the most appropriate  – and the only \n22  realistic – means for redressing the injuries suffered by the thousands of children who are \n23  members of the class.  Reliance upon any one class member’s claims will not effectively remedy \n24  the class-wide issues raised in this suit.  Resolving these common issues in a single action is the \n25  most appropriate and efficient vehicle for obtaining effective relief for plaintiff children. \n26  By contrast, if this action does not proceed as a class action, these foster children will be \n27  unable to address the system-wide deficits that have caused their injuries.  It is not feasible for \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF     21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 5 of 23\n \n1  any individual foster child to carry the burden of developing, preparing and presenting the proof \n2  required to establish and remedy these system-wide failures. \n3  Plaintiffs absolutely satisfy each of Rule 23’s requirements for class certification.  First, \n4  plaintiffs meet the Rule’s “numerosity” criterion.  The class of foster children in Clark County is \n5  much too large to accomplish joinder.  Second, plaintiffs’ claims challenging defendants’ \n6  harmful, system-wide practices by definition share the requisite common questions of law and \n7  fact to fulfill the Rule’s “commonality” factor.  Similarly, plaintiffs easily comply with the \n8  “typicality” standard.  The named representatives’ claims are characteristic of those of the \n9  proposed class.  Finally, based on the class members’ compelling joint interests in pursuing their \n10  shared claims and the engagement of qualified legal counsel, the adequacy of plaintiffs’ \n11  representation is without question. \n12  Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that the Court follow the mandate of Federal Rule \n13  of Civil Procedure 23 and enter an order (1) certifying the proposed class in this case under \n14  Rule 23(b)(2) and (2) declining to require plaintiffs to provide notice to absent class members of \n15  this action prior to final judgment. \n16  II \n \n17  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n18  On August 11, 2006, the United States Department of Health and Human Services \n19  acknowledged that Clark County’s foster care system suffers from “serious deficiencies” that \n20  child welfare officials are currently unable or unwilling to address.  See August 11, 2006 Letter \n21  from Sharon M. Fuji to Michael J. Wilden (hereinafter “Fuji Letter”) at 1, Exh. B to Declaration \n22  of Katina Ancar (“Ancar Decl.”).  These deficits are causing grave harm to the approximately \n23  5,000 children who enter foster care each year due to abuse and neglect, and thus depend on \n24  defendants to provide appropriate care and services.  The children who have suffered the worst \n25  fates are the seventy-nine – including the infant sibling of class representatives Jalen, Sia, \n26  Roshaun, Caleb and King A. – who died from abuse during the last four years.  See Report of \n27  Findings and Recommendations Child Deaths 2001-2004 (“Blue Ribbon Panel Report”) at 8, \n28  Exh.

Plaintiff \n2  Clark K., a seventeen year-old youth, came into Clark County DFS’s legal custody in July 2003. 1  \n3  Before then, the department had received ten reports of abuse or neglect involving Clark and/or \n4  his siblings.  Declaration of Clark K. (“Clark K. Decl.”) ¶ 3.  Neither the multiple reports nor \n5  Clark’s eventual status as a DFS dependent prompted DFS to protect him from circumstances no \n6  child should have to confront.  In 1999, when Clark’s mother moved from Las Vegas, she took \n7  Clark with her where Clark endured horrible living conditions.  He lived with approximately ten \n8  other relatives in a filthy two-bedroom trailer and ate from trash dumpsters.  When his mother \n9  then moved in again this to Virgina he was often left with strangers while his mother bought, \n10  dealt and took drugs.  Clark K. Decl. ¶ 5.  After Clark was able to contact his grandparents, he \n11  came to live with them in Las Vegas.  At the advice of Clark County DFS, Clark’s grandparents \n12  first became his legal guardians and later his licensed foster parents.  Living with his \n13  grandparents, Clark attended school regularly, got good grades, and was in good health.  Id. ¶ 7. \n14  However, Clark’s lack of representation by an attorney or guardian ad litem, and DFS’s \n15  denial of the opportunity for Clark or his grandparents to attend dependency court hearing to \n16  express Clark’s wishes not to go back to his mother, resulted in his return to her.  Id. ¶ 8-10, 14.  \n17  Prior to sending Clark back to Texas, his caseworker failed to assess whether it was safe for him \n18  to return to his mother’s custody.  Had the caseworker conducted a reasonable investigation, he \n19  would have learned that Clark’s mother was on probation for burglary, had been without a job for \n20  a very long time, had no suitable housing, and was continuing to abuse drugs and alcohol.  Id. \n21  ¶ 15.  In her custody, Clark often went days without food.  He also moved around among various \n22  family members, while his mother disappeared on frequent drug binges failing to provide for his \n23  basic needs.  Often he had no transportation to school, and his grades plummeted.  Id. ¶ 20. \n24  In 2005, with help from his grandmother and sister, Clark took a Greyhound bus back to \n25  his grandparents in Las Vegas.  Despite the traumatic events Clark experienced in Texas, his DFS \n                                                 \n26 \n1 Plaintiffs are proceeding under fictitious names and satisfy the requirements of Rule 10(a) of the Federal Rules of \n27  Civil Procedure.  Pseudonym litigation should be permitted in this case because plaintiffs meet the following \nrequirements laid out in Rule 10(a): plaintiffs are children; they are challenging governmental activity; and pressing \n28  the lawsuit using their real identities would compel plaintiffs to reveal highly intimate information. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 3 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 7 of 23\n \n1  caseworker has been unresponsive, making few efforts to provide him with counseling, \n2  educational services, or independent living services.  Clark K. Decl. ¶ 25. \n3  Plaintiffs Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. are siblings – four boys and one girl.  \n4  Declaration of Tarrah Logan (“Logan Decl.”) ¶ 2.  In custody since December 2004, they have \n5  fared no better than plaintiff Clark.  While in DFS custody, these five children have been placed \n6  in multiple inappropriate and dangerous placements that have been harmful to their physical, \n7  mental, and emotional well-being.  They have been placed in a restrictive, overcrowded, and \n8  dangerous child care facility (Child Haven) for almost a year; subjected to further emotional, \n9  physical, and sexual abuse and neglect while in foster and shelter homes; placed in shelter and \n10  foster homes that lacked the information and services to care adequately for their basic needs; \n11  denied treatment and care to address their history of abuse and neglect; denied visitation and \n12  contact with relatives; denied representation by either a guardian ad litem or an attorney during \n13  their first year in foster care; and separated from each other for long periods of time.  Their baby \n14  brother, Jerome, died in a DFS-licensed foster home on April 3, 2005, at the age of 14 months.  \n15  See Generally Logan Decl. ¶ 13. \n16  Sibling seven-year-old Summer, five-year-old Frank, and four-year-old Toni B., who have \n17  been in Clark County DFS’s custody since October 2002, have also had frightful experiences.  \n18  Declaration of Marilyn Paikai (“Paikai Decl.”) ¶ 2, 6.  While in foster care, the children have been \n19  placed with a series of foster parents who were given little background information about the \n20  children or who were not trained or supported to meet the children’s special needs.  Paikai Decl. \n21  ¶¶ 6-7.  As a direct and foreseeable result, the children changed placements many times, with \n22  Frank and Summer experiencing between five and seven placements within three months.  Id. \n23  ¶¶ 7-10.  The children were also physically and emotionally abused in at least one foster home, \n24  and have been placed at Child Haven several times.  In addition, Clark County DFS did not \n25  conduct proper investigations of reports of abuse of Summer and Frank.  Id. ¶¶ 11-12. \n26  Instead of addressing the abuse and ensuring that the children had stable placements, the \n27  children were returned to their mother.  After additional reports of abuse, the children reentered \n28  foster care.  Id. ¶ 16.  Since returning to foster care, DFS has refused to place them in the home of \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 4 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 8 of 23\n \n1  the one foster family that has the experience to care for them properly.  Even though Toni’s \n2  physician has advised that it is in Toni’s best interest to have contact with this family, DFS has \n3  refused to allow communication.  Id. ¶ 17.  Despite their disturbing experiences of abuse, both at \n4  home and in foster care, DFS failed to provide the children with critical health and mental health \n5  services.  Id. ¶¶ 13-14.  For the first year that they were in DFS custody, they were not \n6  represented by a guardian ad litem.  Id. ¶ 4. \n7  Five-year-old plaintiff Donna C. came into Clark County DFS’s legal custody in \n8  December 2004.  Declaration of Jacquelyn Romero (“Romero Decl.”) ¶ 3. Since DFS assumed \n9  responsibility for Donna’s care, at no time has a guardian ad litem or attorney represented her at \n10  court hearings, staffings, Child and Family Team meetings, or in any other decision-making \n11  meetings held by DFS at which decisions were made about her placement, treatment, and/or \n12  permanent plan.  Romero Decl. ¶ 4.  After Donna was returned to her mother on a trial visit, her \n13  mother stole a car and, for months, drove Donna all over the United States and Canada.  Donna \n14  was subjected to a series of traumatizing experiences.  Romero Decl. ¶ 7.  DFS was not visiting \n15  Donna’s home as required.  As a result, DFS did not learn of Donna’s abduction until her mother \n16  was arrested in New Mexico and law enforcement contacted the agency.  Romero Decl. ¶ 10. \n17  Upon her return to DFS custody, Donna was denied necessary and appropriate medical \n18  and mental health care.  Id. ¶ 13.  When Donna’s foster parent asked the juvenile court to \n19  reconsider revising Donna’s visitation plan to ensure her mother could not leave town with her \n20  again.  Donna was removed from this foster home in which she was receiving exemplary care.  \n21  Id. ¶¶ 15-16. \n22  Horrific as these facts are, named plaintiffs’ stories are by no means exceptional.  Rather, \n23  the descriptions of these children’s lives are sadly indicative of DFS’s daily disregard for the \n24  health and safety of all of Clark County’s foster children.  These tragic accounts are merely the \n25  latest signals of the need for defendants to institute an overarching reform of their child welfare \n26  policies and practices to prevent further harm to the children in their care and to comply with \n27  applicable state and federal laws. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 5 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 9 of 23\n \n1  Plaintiff foster children allege claims based on both state and federal statutory rights \n2  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”).  Also under Section 1983, plaintiffs assert their \n3  rights to substantive due process under both the United States and Nevada Constitutions and to \n4  procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  A \n5  highly-structured framework of federal and Nevada state statutes obligate defendants to \n6  affirmatively protect all plaintiffs from maltreatment and to ensure their physical, mental, and \n7  emotional well-being.  Each of these laws confers upon every foster child a specific, personal \n8  right to receipt of the statutes’ contemplated benefits. \n9  Primary within this design is the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n10  1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (the “Adoption Assistance \n11  Act”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 620, 671 et seq.  The Adoption Assistance Act grants to foster children a \n12  number of rights, including but not limited to entitlements to foster placements that meet national \n13  professional standards; quality services that provide for their physical safety and overall health \n14  needs; an up-to-date, written plan setting forth each child’s needs; and the provision of the \n15  services required to meet those needs.  See generally 42 U.S.C. §§ 671, 675.  Defendants have \n16  taken on the obligation of providing these critical services to foster children under the Act.  In \n17  return for accepting this responsibility, defendants receive federal funding for the day-to-day \n18  operations of their foster care programs.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622, 671 et seq.  To receive these federal \n19  grants, as required, the State of Nevada has submitted a “State Plan,” outlining how it will use \n20  these funds to comply with federal child welfare laws. \n21  Defendants also receive federal contributions to sustain their foster care programs under \n22  the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (“CAPTA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq.  As with the \n23  Adoption Assistance Act, receipt of federal CAPTA funds is dependent upon the State Plan.  By \n24  submitting the State Plan, the State of Nevada pledged to comply with CAPTA’s mandates.  This \n25  includes providing every abused or neglected child with a trained guardian ad litem who has a \n26  first-hand understanding of the child’s needs and makes appropriate recommendations to the \n27  juvenile court.  42 U.S.C. § 5101a(b)(2)(A)(xiii). \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 6 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 10 of 23\n \n1  To ensure that plaintiffs’ physical and mental health needs are not overlooked, federal law \n2  provides for state and federal cooperative funding of health programs under the Medicaid Act.   \n3  42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.  Pursuant to the State Plan, defendants must provide certain health care \n4  services, such as Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (“EPSDT”) services, to \n5  foster children under the age of 21.  Once defendants have provided the mandated diagnostic \n6  services, any medical or mental health treatment deemed necessary to remedy the illness is also \n7  required. \n8  Plaintiff foster children are the direct beneficiaries of the services contemplated by each of \n9  these statutes.  Federal courts around the country have determined that state and county violations \n10  of these statutes entitle plaintiffs to pursue their own private action to compel defendants to \n11  provide the care and services due them.2  Therefore, foster children need not be satisfied with any \n12  penalty that the defendants may face from the federal government for failure to comply with \n13  statutory provisions.  Rather, defendants’ flouting of their obligations specifically authorizes \n14  plaintiffs to bring individual actions to achieve legal redress.  Plaintiff children bring this suit to \n15  guard both their rights under these statutes, and to receive the protection and treatment that the \n16  United States and Nevada Constitutions guarantee them.  To ensure that both named plaintiffs and \n17  all Clark County foster children get the care they deserve, plaintiffs request that the Court grant \n18  their motion for class certification. \n19 \nIII \n20   \nLEGAL ARGUMENT \n21 \nA.  Class Certification Requirements Must Be Construed Liberally To Foster The \n22  Efficient Administration of Justice. \n23  Plaintiffs seek to prosecute their suit as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil \n24  Procedure 23.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) seeks to promote judicial efficiency by \n25 \n                                                 \n26  2 See, e.g., Watson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1155 (9th Cir. 2006) (Medicaid Act creates private right of action);   \nKatie A., 433 F.Supp.2d at 1070-1071; Brian A. ex rel. Brooks v. Sundquist, 149 F.

Class \n2  certification thus serves the goal of eliminating the need for multiple and duplicative litigation.  \n3  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998).  Rule 23(a) requires that a party moving to \n4  certify a class show that:  (1) the proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members \n5  individually is impracticable (“numerosity”); (2) there are questions of fact or law common to the \n6  class (“commonality”); (3) the claims or defenses of the class representatives are typical of the \n7  class (“typicality”); and (4) the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the \n8  interests of the class (“adequacy of representation”).  Hanlon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d \n9  497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  In addition to these requirements, the party requesting class \n10  certification must show that the suit falls within one or more of the three kinds of actions \n11  permitted under Rule 23(b).  In this case, plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n12  In evaluating a motion for class certification, the district court has broad power and \n13  discretion, Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 630 (1997), but “is bound to take the \n14  substantive allegations of the complaint as true.”  Thomas v. Baca, 231 F.R.D. 397, 399 (C.D. \n15  Cal. 2005).  Rule 23 requirements are construed liberally, rather than restrictively.  Equal \n16  Employment Opportunity Commission v. General Tel. Co. of Northwest, Inc., 599 F.2d 322, \n17  328 (9th Cir. 1979).  Furthermore, in determining the propriety of class certification, the question \n18  is not whether [plaintiffs] have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather \n19  whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.”  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 \n20  (1974); see also Jordan v. Los Angeles County, 669 F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on \n21  other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982). \n22  “It is well settled that class actions are an appropriate procedure in government benefits \n23  cases where statutes and policies are likely to have an impact upon a broad class of recipients.” 5 \n24  H. Newberg, Class Actions, § 23.7 at 510 (4th ed. 2002); see also Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. \n25  682, 684 (1997) (class certification was appropriate where plaintiff class requested \n26  reconsideration or waiver of recoupment under Section 204 of the Social Security Act).  Federal \n27  district courts around the country have recognized that class action certification is an appropriate \n28  vehicle for foster children to pursue reform of state and county child welfare systems.  See, e.g., \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 8 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 12 of 23\n \n1  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming certification of class of New \n2  York foster children alleging injuries based on systemic conduct); Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d \n3  48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994) (ruling that district court abused discretion in refusing to certify class of \n4  Philadelphia’s foster children requesting injunctive relief); Katie A. v. Bonta, 433 F.Supp.2d \n5  1065, 1067 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (finding certification appropriate where class alleged state’s foster \n6  children with behavioral, emotional or psychiatric impairments were denied adequate mental \n7  health services ); David C. v. Leavitt, 13 F.Supp.2d 1206, 1207 (D. Utah 1998) (court noted its \n8  earlier certification of a statewide class of foster children).  Clark County’s foster children assert \n9  claims similar to those that these courts have acknowledged as suitable for class action \n10  certification.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion should be granted. \n11 \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Ascertainable Class Is So Numerous That Joinder of All Parties Is \nImpracticable. \n12 \n13  The proposed class plainly meets the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure’s numerosity \n14  requirement for class certification.  Plaintiffs’ class, though identifiable, is too numerous to \n15  permit joinder under other available procedures.  In such a situation, class certification is proper. \n16  Rule 23(a)(1) provides that a class action is appropriate when “the class is so numerous \n17  that joinder of all parties is impracticable.”  Where a class is large enough to effectively preclude \n18  joinder of all parties into a single action, courts have found joinder impracticable.  Harris v. Palm \n19  Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 1964) (where the “classes involved are \n20  self-evidently large,” the numerosity requirement is met); Stolz v. United Broth. of Carpenters \n21  and Joiners of America, 620 F. Supp. 396, 404 (D. Nev. 1985).  Although Rule 23(a) contains no \n22  numerical minimum, using case law interpreting Rule 23 as a guide, a class of plaintiffs’ size \n23  certainly satisfies the numerosity condition. \n24  Plaintiffs need not establish the precise size of the class to obtain certification.  See, e.g., \n25  Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1039 (5th Cir. 1981) (stating that \n26  “federal trial courts are quite willing to accept common sense assumptions in order to support a \n27  finding of numerosity”); Marisol A., 929 F. Supp at 689, aff’d 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. 1997).  \n28  However, according to the most recent records, the State of Nevada estimated that 5,262 foster \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 9 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 13 of 23\n \n1  children were in foster care in July 2004.  See UNITY Placement Summary for State, Clark and \n2  Washoe at 1, Exh. D to Ancar Decl.  Clark County alone retained responsibility for nearly 4,000 \n3  of these children.  See id.  However, the placement summary estimate is merely a one-time \n4  snapshot of the number of children of care.  The calculation does not include those children taken \n5  into foster care after July 2004, and does not take into account those children released from DFS \n6  custody before July 2004.  Nor does the summary include similar estimates for prior and \n7  subsequent years.  As a result, the proposed class is not a static entity, but rather constitutes a \n8  fluid group that may fluctuate over the course of months or even days.  Thus, without additional \n9  statistics, the state’s placement data represent the lowest possible estimate of the proposed class.  \n10  Nonetheless, even this minimum approximation confirms that the proposed class numbers \n11  exceeds 4,000 children.  Accordingly, even under defendants’ own estimate, there is no doubt that \n12  the class’ size makes joinder of the plaintiffs in this action impracticable.  Stolz, 620 F. Supp. at  \n13  404 (holding that class numbering “close to 700 . . . clearly makes joinder . . . impracticable”).  A \n14  proposed class of 4,000 or more members is simply too large to accomplish joinder of all parties. \n15  Plaintiffs’ status as abused and neglected minors placed in the care and custody of the \n16  very defendants against whom they seek relief, further elucidates why joinder is impracticable.  A \n17  group of plaintiffs suffering from either the realistic fear of retaliation or lacking the financial \n18  means to pursue individualized remedies may severely hinder attempts at joinder.  Robidoux v. \n19  Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2nd Cir. 1993) (where plaintiffs’ status as public benefits recipients \n20  indicated that they were too financially disadvantaged to pursue individual claims, joinder \n21  impracticable); see also Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 625 (5th Cir. \n22  1999) (factors weighing in favor of certification include plaintiffs’ reluctance to file individual \n23  suit against employer on whom plaintiffs’ continued to depend for livelihood); Caroline C. v. \n24  Johnson, 174 F.R.D. 452, 463 (D. Neb. 1996) (class requiring psychological treatment in \n25  institutional setting places members “in a poor position to seek legal redress individually”).  All \n26  of these deterrent factors apply to plaintiff children. \n27  Here, the proposed class is composed of children in foster care who have been, are, or will \n28  be victims of child abuse and neglect, and who have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 10 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 14 of 23\n \n1  Clark County DFS.  Children in foster care clearly lack the economic means to pursue individual \n2  claims for denial of services such as adequate medical and health care, educational services and \n3  legal representation.  Further, these children’s challenge to the policies and actions of the \n4  agencies that control their placement and basic needs understandably leaves plaintiffs (and their \n5  foster caregivers) hesitant to attempt individual action against defendants.  Mullen, 186 F.3d at \n6  625 (factors weighing in favor of certification include plaintiffs’ reluctance to file individual suit \n7  against employer on whom plaintiffs continued to depend for livelihood); see also Romero Decl. \n8  ¶¶ 15-17 (plaintiff removed from foster parent after foster parent advised court that unconditional \n9  return to mother would be detrimental).  Foster children have neither the independent financial \n10  resources nor the legal knowledge necessary to prosecute claims against the government entities \n11  on which they depend for their care.  As a result, plaintiffs labor under financial and practical \n12  deficits that make joinder of their individual claims nearly impossible. \n13  Finally, plaintiffs proposed class is readily discernable under the Rule 23 standard.  A \n14  class is sufficiently definite when it is administratively feasible to determine whether a given \n15  individual is a member.   Stolz, 620 F. Supp. at 403-404.  Just as plaintiffs need not provide the \n16  precise size of the class, identification of each individual member is also not necessary.  Instead, \n17  one must simply be able to ascertain membership when measured against an objective standard.  \n18  Id.  The prospective class consists of children who have been, are, or will be victims of child \n19  abuse and neglect, and who have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of Clark County DFS.  \n20  Defendants themselves have the means to identify, and are required to monitor, the children who \n21  constitute this class.  Consequently, the proposed plaintiff class surpasses the numerosity \n22  threshold. \n23  C.  Questions of Law and Fact Are Common to the Class. \n24  Certification is proper under Rule 23(a)(2) when the class members’ claims share a \n25  common question of law or fact.  Because defendants’ systematic failure to fulfill their statutory \n26  and regulatory obligations deprives each class member of the right to receive proper care, \n27  adequate medical treatment, and other necessary services, plaintiffs satisfy the Rule’s \n28  commonality requirement. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 11 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 15 of 23\n \n1  Similar to its interpretation of Rule 23 as a whole, the Ninth Circuit has permissively \n2  construed the commonality prerequisite of Rule 23(a)(2).  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n3  1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998); see also Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1321 (courts’ permissive application of \n4  Rule 23(a)(2) means that plaintiffs usually meet commonality requirement).  Rule 23(a)(2) does \n5  not demand that all members of the proposed class share identical legal claims.  Nor must each \n6  class member share exactly the same factual circumstances.  Rather, the commonality prerequisite \n7  is satisfied if plaintiffs share at least one question of law or fact.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019 (“All \n8  questions of fact and law need not be common.”); Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th \n9  Cir. 2001) (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56 (commonality met if class representatives share “at \n10  least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class”)). \n11  The named plaintiffs share a number of common questions of law and fact with members \n12  of the proposed class.  These common questions include \n13  •  Whether plaintiff children are placed in overcrowded, unlicensed congregate care \n14  facilities that fail to meet their needs; \n15  •  Whether plaintiff children are left in dangerous situations due to defendants’ \n16  failure to conduct timely investigations of reports of abuse and neglect; \n17  •  Whether class members are deprived of needed medical, mental health, and dental \n18  care services; \n19  •  Whether upon entry into foster care class members’ placement in Child Haven, an \n20  unlicensed child care facility, violates Nevada and federal laws; \n21  •  Whether the failure to conduct timely investigations of complaints of child abuse \n22  or neglect involving class members violates their rights under Nevada and federal \n23  law; and \n24  •  Whether the failure to provide class members with timely necessary medical and \n25  mental health screenings, assessments, and treatment denies their rights under \n26  Nevada and federal law. \n27  Defendant DFS Director Tom Morton himself has confirmed that the sheer breadth of \n28  defendants’ failings produce shared factual and legal issues for plaintiffs.

See generally Safe Futures: Strategies to Improve the Safety, Permanence and \n4  Well-being of Clark County Children and Families at Risk of Child Maltreatment (Phase I), Exh. \n5  E to Ancar Decl.  Defendant Morton admits that plaintiff foster children are placed in often \n6  overcrowded conditions and with families who are not provided the necessary support to prevent \n7  shuffling them from one placement to another.  Id. at 4.  The completion of initial investigations \n8  and safety plans for children reported to Child Protective Services (“CPS”), full assessment of \n9  children’s developmental and educational needs, and EPSDT medical screenings are all critical to \n10  the wellbeing of abused and neglected children.  Safe Futures catalogs these measures as \n11  “objectives” that defendants have yet to meet.  Id. at 4, 7, 14, 16.  Defendant Morton also \n12  corroborates plaintiffs’ allegations that children and families are not seen by caseworkers each \n13  month nor do they received needed services.  Id. at 4. \n14  These and other acknowledged deficiencies are not confined to a small number of foster \n15  children.  Safe Futures concedes that “crisis in performance” extends to the entire agency, and \n16  thus potentially to every child for whom DFS bears responsibility.  Safe Futures at 4, Exh. E to \n17  Ancar Decl; see also Enclosure to Fuji Letter at 1, Exh. B to Ancar Decl. (widespread lack of \n18  services to Clark County’s foster children is a “significant system issue”).  This common course \n19  of conduct in and of itself creates common questions among plaintiffs. \n20  The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that civil rights suits challenging a system-wide \n21  practice or policy affecting all members of a prospective class fulfill Rule 23’s commonality \n22  requirement.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 868 (citing LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th \n23  Cir. 1985)).  Each child plaintiff need not actually experience precisely the same injury as a result \n24  of the legally objectionable practice.  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047.  Rather, because the proposed \n25  class alleges that systematic failure to fulfill statutory and regulatory obligations places all \n26  members at risk of similar injury, plaintiffs share common questions of law and fact.  Variations \n27  among individual plaintiffs’ factual circumstances cannot defeat a finding of commonality.  \n28  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 868 (citing Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56). \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 13 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 17 of 23\n \n1  Suits seeking to remedy statutory and regulatory violations are particularly favored for \n2  class action certification and meet the commonality requirement.  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047 \n3  (certification proper because class sought injunctive relief rather than money damages).  Where \n4  injunctive and declaratory relief is requested against a defendant “engaging in a common course \n5  of conduct,” common questions naturally arise.  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57; see also Walters, 145 \n6  F.3d at 1047.  Accordingly, the proposed class easily achieves commonality. \n7  D.  The Named Plaintiffs’ Claims and Defenses Are Typical of Those of the Class. \n8  Plaintiffs’ proposed representatives and members of the prospective class have suffered \n9  similar harms.  These injuries stem directly from defendants’ refusal to conform its child welfare \n10  practices to state and federal law.  As victims of defendants’ improper policies and practices – \n11  and potential recipients of the proposed class relief – the named plaintiffs have every incentive to \n12  forcefully assert the class claims. \n13  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the named plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class.  \n14  The goal of the typicality prong of Rule 23 is to ensure that the named representatives’ and class \n15  members’ interests are sufficiently aligned such that the named plaintiffs will provide effective \n16  representation for the class.  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57-58.  The determination of typicality rests \n17  on whether a comparable course of conduct resulting in similar injury gives rise to the class \n18  members’ legal claims.  Hanlon, 976 F.2d at 508. \n19  The named plaintiffs and the proposed class allege that each has been similarly harmed by \n20  the identical course of conduct: defendants’ practice of violating their legal obligations to institute \n21  proper investigations, assessments, and supervision to ensure plaintiffs safe day-to-day care; to \n22  offer adequate medical, dental, and mental health treatment; and to provide other required \n23  services, including proper educational placements and dependency court representation. \n24  Defendants’ legal duties to each plaintiff originates from the same equally-applicable statutory \n25  scheme.  As a consequence of their receipt of monetary appropriations under the federal Adoption \n26  Assistance, Medicaid, and CAPTA laws, defendants are obliged to meet certain federal standards \n27  for the provision of necessary services to foster children.  See generally 42 U.S.C. §§ 620, 670 et \n28  seq., 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq, 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq.

Rev. Stat. Ann. § 422 et seq.; Nev. Admin. Code § 422-424, 432A-B et seq.  \n3  Through the passage of Assembly Bill 1 (“AB 1”) in 2001, Clark County also accepted direct \n4  responsibility from the state for services to foster children.  Nonetheless, AB 1 did not relieve the \n5  state of its responsibility and oversight for child welfare programs.  2001 Nev. Stat. 1. (commonly \n6  known as AB 1). \n7  Defendants’ conduct in refusing to fulfill their duties has deprived the class and its \n8  representatives of the services to which they are entitled under federal and state child protection \n9  laws.  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58 (even prominent factual differences among foster children could \n10  not defeat typicality where class challenged effects of defendants’ policies and practices).  The \n11  claims of the named plaintiffs and proposed class rest on the identical legal theories that each has \n12  been denied, legally-mandated services and constitutionally-protected civil rights as a result of \n13  defendants’ refusal to properly implement this statutory scheme.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 869 \n14  (typicality requirement satisfied where defendant’s refusal to provide legally-required \n15  accommodations to persons with diverse physical disabilities); Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58 \n16  (similarity of foster children’s legal theories adequately addresses typicality).  Neither the class \n17  claims nor their factual underpinning need be identical (or even “substantially identical”) to \n18  satisfy the typicality requirement.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020; see also Marisol A., 929 F. Supp. at \n19  691.  The representatives’ and class claims need merely be “reasonably coextensive” to make \n20  certification appropriate.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 869. \n21  The fact that each and every child has not been subjected to the overcrowded conditions at \n22  Child Haven or placed in an unlicensed foster home will not prevent named plaintiffs from \n23  pursuing the class claims certification.  Nor must a foster child be compelled to wait until she is \n24  specifically denied the right to speak in court for lack of a guardian ad litem, or hope that she will \n25  not personally become the subject of a child death review before seeking systematic relief.  Kenny \n26  A. v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 301 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (each plaintiff not required to “personally \n27  experience every difficulty outlined in the complaint”).  Rather where, as here, plaintiffs present a \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 15 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 19 of 23\n \n1  central allegation of systematic failure to provide legally-mandated services and protection, \n2  typicality is satisfied. \n3  The named plaintiffs’ injuries are characteristic of those endured by the child plaintiffs.  \n4  Even though plaintiffs’ injuries are necessarily based on factually different circumstances, named \n5  plaintiffs’ claims and interests align so fully with those of the class that their pursuit of their own \n6  claims for injunctive relief by definition further the claims of all class members.  Consequently, \n7  plaintiffs’ claims easily fulfill the requirement of typicality. \n8 \nE.  Named Plaintiffs and Their Attorneys Will Fairly and Adequately Protect Class \nInterests. \n9 \n10  Plaintiffs have established that they meet the numerosity, commonality, and typicality \n11  requirements of Rule 23.  The Rule’s final prong requires that plaintiffs show the ability and \n12  willingness to protect fairly and adequately the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs’ collective \n13  interests and their representation by experienced class counsel ensure that named plaintiffs will \n14  zealously guard and pursue the interests of the class at every stage of the case. \n15  The Ninth Circuit has held that adequate class representation as required by Rule 23(a)(4) \n16  is conditioned upon four factors: the quality of class counsel, the absence of antagonism within \n17  the class, a shared interest between the absent class members and their representatives, and the \n18  “unlikelihood that the suit is collusive.”  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046. \n19  The named plaintiffs have previously established their compelling joint interests in \n20  forcefully pursuing their shared claims, which include numerous common questions of both law \n21  and fact.  See infra § B.  With the common goal of ending the widespread violation of their legal \n22  rights and instituting systematic reform of Clark County’s child welfare system, no animosity \n23  exists among class members.  Stolz, 620 F. Supp. at 405 (plaintiffs’ aim of remedying statutory \n24  violations of class member rights inherently removed threat antagonism); Marisol A., 929 F. \n25  Supp. at 629 (request for injunctive relief to force compliance with the law eliminates potential \n26  for conflict).  Conversely, there is no indication of collusion between plaintiff children and the \n27  defendants in this action.  To the contrary, defendants’ recently filed motions to dismiss suggest \n28  that defendants intend to litigate this action as any individual suit. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 16 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 20 of 23\n \n1  Rule 23’s standard is conditioned upon plaintiffs’ attorneys’ quality, experience, and \n2  general capability to conduct the litigation.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555, 562 (2d \n3  Cir. 1968); Jordan v. Los Angeles County,  669 F.2d 1311, 1323 (9th Cir. 1982).  Plaintiffs’ lead \n4  counsel is the National Center for Youth Law, a privately-funded, non-profit organization with \n5  extensive state and federal court experience in litigating complex class actions involving child \n6  welfare systems.  See generally Declaration of William Grimm (“Grimm Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-8.

Plaintiffs’ legal representatives have the resources, \n15  expertise, and experience to meet the test for highly-competent class counsel. \n16  F.  The Proposed Class Satisfies the Prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(2) Because Defendants \nHave Acted on Grounds Generally Applicable to the Class Making Injunctive Relief \n17  Appropriate. \n18  Having established that the plaintiff class is entitled to certification under Rule 23(a), \n19  plaintiffs also assert that the class may be properly maintained under the second category of \n20  Rule 23(b).  Rule 23(b)(2) certification is proper if \n21  the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \n22  injunctive relief or  corresponding declaratory relief with respect to \nthe class as a whole. \n23 \n24  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047. \n25  Subdivision (b)(2) is closely linked to the commonality prerequisite.  Actions seeking \n26  injunctive relief to remedy practices violative of civil and constitutional rights fall easily within \n27  the commonality guidelines.  See infra § C. Consequently, these same suits “are precisely the \n28  sort . . . that Rule 23(b)(2) was designed to facilitate.”  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046-47 (plaintiff \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 17 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 21 of 23\n \n1  class challenged constitutionality of the INS’s official forms and procedures); see Fed. R.

Defendants’ have subjected plaintiffs to a unitary course of conduct that \n7  systematically violates state and federal law and deprives each class member of their rights to \n8  receive essential protections and services.  Suits raising challenges to defendants who have acted \n9  in a manner generally applicable to all plaintiffs exemplify “the classic type of action envisioned \n10  by the drafters” of the Rule 23(b)(2) category.  Elliot v. Weinberger, 564 F.2d 1219, 1229 (9th \n11  Cir. 1977), aff’d in part and reversed in part on other grounds sub nom Califano v. Yamaki, 442 \n12  U.S. 682 (1979) (Subdivision (b)(2) proper for certification of nationwide class of recipient of \n13  old-age and disability social security benefits alleging lack of hearing violated due process).  \n14  Plaintiffs’  request for declaratory and final injunctive relief to correct defendants’ conduct are \n15  also particularly appropriate for Rule 23(b)(2) certification.  Stolz, 620 F. Supp. at 407 \n16  (Rule 23(b)(2) certification proper even where monetary relief is an ancillary element of \n17  requested damages). \n18  Finally, a primary goal of class certification is the efficient administration of justice.   \n19  Elliot, 564 F.2d at 1230.  Thus, class certification serves not only the goal of relieving the court  \n20  of the burden of adjudicating duplicative litigation, see Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047, but also to \n21  provide a vehicle for plaintiffs with similar grievances to “have their day in court.”  Eisen v. \n22  Carlisle, 391 F.2d 555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968).  Absent class action certification and broad-based \n23  institutional reform, thousands of child plaintiffs would be left to pursue multiple and identical \n24  actions. Even were some plaintiffs able to maintain and succeed in individual suits, singular \n25  judgments would not carry the guarantee that defendants would consistently fulfill their legal \n26  obligations to other children in their care, providing no benefit to the class.  Cf. generally \n27  Complaint, Cabrera v. Balane, No. 06-CV-1285 (JCU) (D. Nev.

Notice Prior to Judgment Is Not Required in a Class Action Certified Pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2). \n5 \n6  Unlike class actions certified under other subdivisions of Rule 23, due process does not \n7  require named plaintiffs representing subdivision (b)(2) class to issue pre-judgment notice to \n8  absent class members.  Elliot, 564 F.2d at 1228 (citing Eisen, 417 U.S. at 177).  Class notification \n9  under this category is discretionary.  A court should impose such an obligation only when \n10  necessary to ensure that the class is fairly and adequately represented or to permit absent \n11  members to assert additional claims.  Stolz, 620 F. Supp. at 408. \n12  Plaintiffs’ circumstances do not indicate that notice is necessary to protect their due \n13  process rights.  As demonstrated above, the proposed class is adequately represented by skilled, \n14  knowledgeable counsel with significant class action and child welfare experience.  Where counsel \n15  is competent and the named representatives claims’ are typical of the class, notice to the class \n16  serves no further goal.  Elliot, 564 F.2d at 1228.  To the contrary, compelling provision of notice \n17  may in fact be detrimental to the class’ legal interests, as the financial cost associated with notice \n18  to a subdivision (b)(2) class can thwart plaintiffs’ ability to maintain an action seeking broad-\n19  based reform.  See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23 Advisory Committee Notes 1966 Amendment (noting \n20  the “crippl[ing]” cost of notice where money damages not requested). \n21  To ensure that plaintiff children’s ability to vigorously pursue their claims is not severely \n22  undermined, should the Court grant the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, plaintiffs should \n23  not be required to provide notice to absent class members. \n24  IV \n \n25  CONCLUSION \n26  Through their dismal failure to provide mandated services to the foster children in their \n27  care, defendants have abandoned their legal obligations to plaintiffs.  Without proper care, \n28  medical treatment and supervision, Clark County’s foster children have faced unsafe living \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nAND MPA IN SUPPORT THEREOF  - 19 -  21433\\1078486.7 \nCASE NO.:  2:06-CV-01068 RCJ \n  \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 74   Filed 11/21/06   Page 23 of 23\n \n1  conditions, continued physical abuse, and, in far too many documented cases, death.

This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought by ten children on behalf of all \n27 \nabused and neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care \n28 \n-6- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 7 of 73\n \n1  system.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel Nevada and Clark County \n2  officials to meet their legal duties under federal and state law to protect and care for abused \n3 \nand neglected children.  \n4 \n  18.  During 2004, there were 8,979 investigations of child abuse or neglect reports \n5 \nin Clark County.  During the same year, 4,548 children entered foster care.  There are  \n6 \ncurrently over 3,600 children in the legal custody of Clark County placed in foster family \n7 \nhomes, group homes, unlicensed and/or unpaid relative homes, and other settings. \n8 \n  19.  Until 2004, Nevada operated a bifurcated child welfare system in which the \n9 \nstate’s two counties with populations of over 100,000 – Clark and Washoe Counties – were \n10 \n11  responsible for providing child protective services, while the State bore responsibility for \n12  providing foster care services.  As a result of AB 1, passed by the Nevada State Legislature in \n13 \n2001, responsibility for both child protective services and foster care were vested with Clark \n14 \nand Washoe Counties.  The State retained responsibility for supervision and oversight of \n15 \nClark and Washoe Counties’ programs to ensure, among other things, compliance with \n16 \nfederal and state laws, regulations, and standards.  The transfer of foster care staff and \n17 \nservices from the State to Clark County was completed in October 2004.  \n18 \n  20.  Clark County’s child welfare system is in crisis.  Virtually every aspect of the \n19 \nCounty’s child protective services and foster care system is failing the children and youth it is \n20 \ncharged with protecting.  The County’s child welfare system denies children their rights under \n21 \n22  the Federal and State Constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, and accepted professional \n23  standards.   \n24 \n  21.  The County and State’s failures have resulted in harm to an untold number of \n25 \nchildren.  A recent state report indicates that within the last four years at least 79 children \n26 \nhave died from abuse or neglect.  These victims of fatal injuries or neglect include children in \n27 \n28 \n-7- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 8 of 73\n \n1  foster care and children left at home following a substantiated report of abuse.  Many of their \n2  deaths were preventable.  \n3 \n  22.  Within the past two and a half years, one study after another has documented \n4 \nClark County’s failure to protect the health, safety, and well-being of child abuse victims and \n5 \nchildren in foster care.  These studies include:  \n6 \nA February 2004 federal Child and Family Services Review (“CFSR”) of \n(cid:137) \n7 \nNevada’s child welfare system that included an audit of Clark County’s system \n8 \n(“2004 Federal Review”); \n9 \nAn April 2004 Audit of Child Haven and the Clark County Shelter Home \n10  (cid:137) \n11  Program conducted by the Audit Department of Clark County (“2004 County \n12  Audit”); \n13 \nAn April 2005 Report to the Clark County Commissioners on the Status of \n(cid:137) \n14 \nChild Welfare Services (“2005 County CWS Report”);  \n15 \nA June 2005 report of a review of child abuse fatalities in Clark County \n(cid:137) \n16 \nconducted by the Child Welfare Institute of which Defendant Morton was the \n17 \nformer director (“2005 CWI Review”); \n18 \nAn October 2005 case review of Clark County child abuse and foster care \n(cid:137) \n19 \ncases conducted by State DCFS (“2005 County Case Review”); and  \n20 \nAn April 2006 Report of the Findings and Recommendations: Child Deaths \n21  (cid:137) \n22  2001-2004 describing the results of an independent child death review panel \n23  investigation of deaths related to child abuse or neglect in Clark County (“2006 \n24 \nChild Fatality Report”). \n25 \n  23.  During July 2006, representatives of the Administration for Children and \n26 \nFamilies of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“Federal DHHS”) \n27 \nconducted a site visit to reassess Clark County’s child welfare program.  Federal officials \n28 \n-8- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 9 of 73\n \n1  concluded that the situation for children and families served by Clark County’s child welfare \n2  system “has worsened” since officials’ earlier on-site visit in February 2004.  Some of the \n3 \nspecific deficiencies reported by federal officials include:  \n4 \nThe State’s acquiescence in Clark County’s continued use of an unlicensed \n(cid:137) \n5 \ncongregate care facility – Child Haven;  \n6 \nConsistent overcrowding at Child Haven;  \n(cid:137) \n7 \nUnnecessary removal of children from their homes due to Clark County’s \n(cid:137) \n8 \nfailure to provide an adequate array of services to prevent placement;  \n9 \nFrequent changes in placement of children in foster care; \n10  (cid:137) \n11  (cid:137)  Inadequate assessments of the safety of suspected victims of child abuse and \n12  neglect;  \n13 \nInadequate training of staff and insufficient recruitment of foster parents;  \n(cid:137) \n14 \nUnanswered or lengthy delays in answering calls to the Child Abuse Hotline;  \n(cid:137) \n15 \nThe use of an invalid, ineffective risk assessment tool;  \n(cid:137) \n16 \nThe failure to use data to provide effective management oversight and \n(cid:137) \n17 \nsupervision;  \n18 \nAnd the failure to provide a guardian ad litem for every child in foster care.   \n(cid:137) \n19 \n  24.  In a letter to Nevada child welfare officials on August 11, 2006, Sharon M. \n20 \nFujii, the Regional Administrator for the Administration for Children and Families of Federal \n21 \n22  DHHS, informed Nevada that “the manner in which the continuum of child welfare services is \n23  managed in Clark County should be a grave concern to the State.”  She notified state officials \n24 \nthat the current Program Improvement Plan between the State and federal officials “is no \n25 \nlonger adequate to address the serious deficiencies in the State’s child welfare program, most \n26 \nspecifically Clark County which accounts for the majority of the State’s child welfare \n27 \npopulation.”  \n28 \n-9- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 10 of 73\n \n1    25.  For years, Clark County has evaded scrutiny of its child protective services and \n2  foster care programs.  It has hidden behind a veil of confidentiality meant to protect children \n3 \nand families, but which the County has used to shield itself from oversight and criticism.  \n4 \n  26.  Among other things, it has failed and continues to fail to comply with federal \n5 \nlaw requiring that it provide the public with findings and information concerning child abuse \n6 \nvictims who have died or suffered near fatalities.  The little information available to the public \n7 \nabout the child welfare system is incomplete and out of date.  The most recent data on child \n8 \nabuse and foster care is from 2004.  \n9 \n  27.  Nevada and its counties receive millions of dollars in federal funds for the \n10 \n11  provision of child welfare services and are therefore required to comply with federal \n12  mandates, including those set forth in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the Child \n13 \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and \n14 \nTreatment provisions of Medicaid law.  In state fiscal year 2004, Nevada spent over $79 \n15 \nmillion on child welfare services, of which $44 million was federal funds.    \n16 \n  28.  This lawsuit also challenges the placement of children, and the conditions in \n17 \nwhich they are forced to live, at Child Haven – an unlicensed child care institution operated \n18 \nby Clark County.  For years, Child Haven has not been a safe “haven” for the children and \n19 \nyouth placed there.  Upon entering foster care in Clark County, children are placed at Child \n20 \nHaven and remain there for as little as a few hours or as long as a year or more.  For years, \n21 \n22  unlike other facilities providing care to foster children in Nevada, Child Haven has been \n23  allowed to operate without meeting the minimum licensing standards required by state law.  \n24 \nThe Child Haven facility houses infants and young children alongside teenagers, some of \n25 \nwhom have significant behavioral problems and pose a risk of serious harm to the younger, \n26 \nmore vulnerable children in the facility.  Child Haven is frequently extremely overcrowded \n27 \nresulting in children sleeping on the floors and in gymnasiums, separated from their siblings \n28 \n-10- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 11 of 73\n \n1  and in conditions that have contributed to the spread of infectious disease at Child Haven.  \n2  Children’s needs, particularly their need for mental health care, are not being met. \n3 \n  29.  High caseloads and inadequate training of Clark County child protective \n4 \nservices and foster care workers contribute to the crisis within the system.  Many workers’ \n5 \ncaseloads exceed those established by national standards.  Workers are ill prepared and \n6 \nsupervised to perform a job in which failure to abide by law, regulations, and professional \n7 \nstandards, and failure to exercise professional judgment results in serious injury to or death of \n8 \na child.   \n9 \n  30.  Investigations of child abuse reports – both those involving children in foster \n10 \n11  care and those left at home – routinely fail to comply with state law and professional \n12  standards.  As a direct result, children who could and should have been protected suffer \n13 \nunnecessarily.  \n14 \n  31.  Clark County DFS has failed to recruit and retain a sufficient number of foster \n15 \nhomes, resulting in harm to children whose needs are mismatched with the foster parents’ \n16 \nexperience and abilities.  Placements are often made based solely upon whether or not there is \n17 \nan available bed in the foster home.  As a result, placements often break down, and children \n18 \nare shuttled from one house, group home, and institution to another.  Caseworkers fail to visit \n19 \nchildren in these placements, and, as a result, are unaware of the quality of care the child is \n20 \nreceiving, the harm befalling the child, the risk to which the child is exposed, and the lack of \n21 \n22  needed services.   \n23    32.  Children in foster homes recruited, licensed, and supervised by Defendants are \n24 \nsubjected to abuse and neglect in those homes.  When there are complaints about foster \n25 \nhomes, Clark County DFS often turns a deaf ear, allowing children to remain in dangerous \n26 \nhomes that either should not have been licensed in the first place or should have had their \n27 \nlicense revoked.  At the same time, Clark County DFS retaliates against foster parents who \n28 \n-11- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 12 of 73\n \n1  advocate for services for a child placed in their homes or who disagree with the department’s \n2  plan for the child, driving out the very foster parents the system needs.  Clark County DFS \n3 \nalso fails to provide foster parents with even the most basic background information about \n4 \nchildren they place in their homes and the supportive services needed.  \n5 \n  33.  Children entering foster care have many special needs – for medical and \n6 \nmental health care as well as educational and special educational services.  Clark County DFS \n7 \nfails to act as a responsible parent to children in its custody.  As a result, foster children’s \n8 \nneeds are not met and services are delayed or not provided at all, causing substantial harm to \n9 \nthese children.  \n10 \n11    34.  Children in foster care have no voice in the court proceedings where decisions \n12  are made that affect their basic safety, their temporary and permanent placement, and their \n13 \ngeneral well-being.  Even though state and federal law mandate appointment of a \n14 \nrepresentative to look out for the interests of the child in all cases, Clark County falls woefully \n15 \nshort of meeting this requirement.  \n16 \n  35.  If Defendants’ unconstitutional and unlawful actions and omissions are not \n17 \nhalted, many more children will be harmed.  Another generation of children entrusted to the \n18 \nCounty and State will suffer untold misery, some will die, and others will leave the foster care \n19 \nsystem ill prepared to live healthy, independent, and productive lives. \n20 \nIV. \n21 \n22  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n23    36.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) \n24 \nand 23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs represent a countywide class of children who have been, are, or will \n25 \nbe victims of child abuse and neglect and have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of \n26 \nClark County DFS.  \n27 \n28 \n-12- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 13 of 73\n \n1    37.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are met in that the class is so numerous \n2  that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Furthermore, the class is fluid in that new \n3 \nmembers are regularly created.  There are over 3,600 children in foster care in Clark County.  \n4 \nThroughout the year, many more children enter care than is reflected in any single day census.  \n5 \nDuring 2004, for example, a total of 4,548 were removed from their homes and placed in \n6 \nfoster care. \n7 \n  38.  All the members share common issues of law and fact.  All of the plaintiffs and \n8 \nclass members are in need of adequate child welfare services, must rely on Clark County DFS \n9 \nand State DCFS Defendants for those services, and are harmed by Defendants’ systemic \n10 \n11  failure to fulfill their legal obligations to provide safe care, adequate treatment, and necessary \n12  services.  Questions of law and fact common to the class of plaintiffs predominate over any \n13 \nindividual issues of law and fact. \n14 \n  39.  Specific common questions of fact include, but are not limited to, \n15 \na)  Whether class members are placed at an overcrowded, unlicensed \n16 \ncongregate facility that fails to meet their needs; \n17 \nb)  Whether class members are left in dangerous situations due to \n18 \nDefendants’ failure to conduct timely investigations of reports of abuse and \n19 \nneglect; \n20 \nc)  Whether Defendants fail to recruit and support an adequate array of \n21 \n22  foster placements to meet the needs of class members; \n23  d)  Whether class members are placed in homes and other facilities in \n24 \nwhich they have been harmed or are at risk of harm; \n25 \ne)  Whether class members are deprived of needed medical, mental health, \n26 \nand dental care services; \n27 \n28 \n-13- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 14 of 73\n \n1  f)  Whether class members are provided with appropriate educational \n2  services; \n3 \ng)  Whether class members are represented by a guardian ad litem in abuse \n4 \nand neglect proceedings in the Clark County District Court; \n5 \n  40.  Specific common questions of law include, but are not limited to, \n6 \na)  Whether upon entry into foster care class members’ placement in Child \n7 \nHaven, an unlicensed child care facility, violates Nevada and federal laws; \n8 \nb)  Whether the failure to conduct timely investigations of complaints of \n9 \nchild abuse or neglect involving class members violates their rights under \n10 \n11  Nevada and federal law;  \n12  c)  Whether the failure to properly screen, license, support and supervise \n13 \nfoster homes in which class members are placed is a denial of their rights \n14 \nunder Nevada and federal law; \n15 \nd)  Whether the failure to provide class members with timely necessary \n16 \nmedical and mental health screenings, assessments, and treatment denies \n17 \ntheir rights under Nevada and federal law; and \n18 \ne)  Whether the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for class members is \n19 \na denial of their rights under Nevada and federal law;   \n20 \n  41.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class they \n21 \n22  represent. \n23    42.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n24 \nthey represent.  Plaintiffs know of no conflict of interest among the class members.  \n25 \n  43.  Each named plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n26 \nsufficiently familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the child’s situation to \n27 \nfairly and adequately represent the child’s interests in this litigation.  \n28 \n-14- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 15 of 73\n \n1    44.  Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who will adequately \n2  represent the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs are represented by the National Center for Youth \n3 \nLaw, a privately funded, non-profit organization with extensive national experience in \n4 \ncomplex class action litigation involving child welfare systems.  They are also represented by \n5 \nLas Vegas attorneys Bruno Wolfenzon and Greg Schulman with Wolfenzon Schulman.  \n6 \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have the resources, expertise, and experience to prosecute this action.   \n7 \n  45.  Defendants have acted and refused to act and continue to do so on grounds \n8 \ngenerally applicable to the class that plaintiffs represent, thereby rendering appropriate \n9 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a whole.  \n10 \n11  V. \n12  FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTORY BACKGROUND \n \n13 \nA.  Nevada statutory framework \n \n14 \n    1.  Child abuse/neglect investigations\n \n15 \n  46.  In Nevada counties with populations of 100,000 or more, the responsibility for \n16 \nproviding protective services for children rests with the county.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n17 \n432B.325.  In Clark County, this responsibility rests with Clark County DFS.  \n18 \n19    47.  Clark County DFS is responsible for receiving, screening, and investigating all \n20  reports of suspected child abuse and neglect.   \n21    48.  Clark County DFS must immediately initiate an investigation if the report \n22 \nindicates that the child is five years of age or younger; if there is a high risk of serious harm to \n23 \nthe child; or if the child is living in a household in which another child has died, the child is \n24 \nseriously injured, or has visible signs of physical abuse.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.260(2).  \n25 \nIn all other situations, the department must conduct an evaluation within three days of \n26 \nreceiving the report to determine whether an investigation is warranted.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n27 \n§ 432B.260(3).  If the department determines that an investigation is warranted, it must \n28 \n-15- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 16 of 73\n \n1  initiate an investigation within three days of completing the evaluation.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n2  § 432B.260(4).   \n3 \n  49.  All child protective services investigations must include certain actions.  In all \n4 \ncases there must be a prompt face-to-face meeting with the child   Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § \n5 \n432B.155.  If there are other children in the household, the caseworker must also assess the \n6 \nprotective needs of each of those children even though they may not be the subject of the \n7 \nreport.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.150(3)(c). \n8 \n  50.  The child protective service investigation must be completed within 30 days of \n9 \nreceipt of the report, at which time Clark County DFS must determine if the report is \n10 \n11  substantiated or unsubstantiated.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.170 (a).  Upon completion \n12  of the investigation, the department may file a petition with the juvenile court, provide \n13 \nservices to the family to ensure the safety of the child or children, or close the case.  \n14 \n    2.  Protective custody and filing of petition\n15 \n  51.  While conducting or upon completion of an investigation Clark County DFS \n16 \n17  may decide to remove the child from the home and place the child in protective custody.  Nev. \n18  Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.390.  \n19 \n  52.  If the child is placed in protective custody, a juvenile court hearing must take \n20 \nplace within 72 hours to determine whether the child should remain in protective custody or \n21 \nbe returned home pending further action by the Court.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.470(a).  \n22 \n  53.  Within ten days of the hearing on protective custody, Clark County DFS must \n23 \nfile a petition to initiate further child welfare proceedings or recommend against further court \n24 \naction.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.490(1)(a).   \n25 \n  54.  If the child is released from protective custody, Clark County DFS must \n26 \nprovide a range of services to help preserve the family and prevent further placement outside \n27 \n28  the home, including, but not limited to: social work and counseling, psychological and \n-16- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 17 of 73\n \n1  medical services, parental education and services for treatment of substance abuse.  Nev. \n2  Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.240. \n3 \n    3.  Adjudicatory and dispositional hearings\n4 \n  55.  An adjudicatory hearing must be held within 30 days of filing the petition.  \n5 \n6  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.530(1)-(2).  If the court finds that the allegations in the petition \n7  are unsupported, the petition is dismissed and the child ordered released if he is in protective \n8  custody.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.530(5).  If the court determines that the allegations in \n9 \nthe petition are true and that the child is in need of protection, Clark County DFS is required \n10 \nto submit a report and recommendations for the disposition of the case.  If the department \n11 \nrecommends that the child be removed from the custody of her parents, it must submit a plan \n12 \nfor ensuring that the child will receive safe, proper, and appropriate care in the placement, and \n13 \ndescribe the services that will be provided to the child and her parents to facilitate the \n14 \nreunification of the family.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.540(2). \n15 \n  56.  Upon receipt of the report and recommendation of Clark County DFS, the \n16 \n17  court may order the child to remain in the custody of his parents with or without supervision \n18  by Clark County DFS, place the child in the custody of a relative, or place him in the custody \n19 \nof the department.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.550. \n20 \n    4.  Appointment of guardian ad litem\n21 \n  57.  Upon the filing of a petition, the court must appoint a guardian ad litem for the \n22 \n23  child.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.500.  The guardian ad litem must “represent and protect \n24  the best interests of the child until excused by the court” and “inform the court of the desires \n25 \nof the child, but exercise his independent judgment regarding the best interests of the child.”  \n26 \nNev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.500(3)(a)&(g).  Among other responsibilities, the guardian ad \n27 \nlitem is required to research the facts of the child’s case and ensure that the court receives an \n28 \n-17- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 18 of 73\n \n1  independent, objective account of the facts; meet with the child at the child’s placement as \n2  often as necessary to determine whether the child is safe and to ascertain that the placement is \n3 \nin the child’s best interests; participate in the development and negotiation of any plans or \n4 \norders regarding the child; monitor whether the plans are being implemented and appropriate \n5 \nservices are being provided; appear at all proceedings regarding the child; and present \n6 \nrecommendations to the court.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.500(3). \n7 \n8      5.  Placement in and supervision of foster family homes\n9 \n  58.  State DCFS is required to establish and ensure the counties’ compliance with \n10 \nminimum standards for foster family homes, group homes, and other child care facilities in \n11 \nwhich foster children are placed.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §424.020.  In carrying out this \n12 \nobligation, State DCFS is required to promulgate regulations establishing uniform standards \n13 \nfor the licensing of foster family homes, group homes, and child care institutions.  Nev. Rev. \n14 \nStat. Ann. § 432B.190(1). \n15 \n  59.  Clark County DFS is responsible for licensing foster and group homes in \n16 \n17  which it places foster children in its custody and ensuring that those homes meet state \n18  standards.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §424.030; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §424.016(1).  Licensing is \n19 \nrequired in order to protect children from abuse or neglect and ensure that the foster parent \n20 \ncan properly care for children.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§424.016; 424.030; Nev. Admin. Code \n21 \nAnn. § 424.100.   \n22 \n  60.  Upon being granted protective or legal custody of a child in foster care, Clark \n23 \nCounty DFS selects the foster home or other setting in which the child is placed.   \n24 \n  61.  Any child care institution used for the placement of foster children must be \n25 \nlicensed by either the city, county, or state, depending on its location.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ \n26 \n432A.131; 432A.220.  Child care institutions located within Las Vegas must be licensed by \n27 \n28 \n-18- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 19 of 73\n \n1  the city.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432A.131.  It is a misdemeanor offense to operate a child \n2  care institution without a license.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432A.220.  \n3 \n  62.  No family foster home can be licensed to care for more than six children, \n4 \nexcluding any children residing in the home who are related to the foster parent or who are \n5 \nnot foster children.  The number of children for whom a home may be licensed must factor in \n6 \nthe foster parents’ own children under the age of 16, as well as the characteristics of the \n7 \nchildren in need of placement.  No more than two children under the age of eighteen months \n8 \nor four children under the age of five may be placed in the same home.  Nev. Admin. Code \n9 \nAnn. § 424.160. \n10 \n11    63.  Before placing a child in a foster home, Clark County DFS must provide the \n12  foster parent with information necessary to ensure the health and safety of the child and other \n13 \npersons in the foster home.  That information must include the medical history and behavior \n14 \nof the child.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.038  \n15 \n  64.  Clark County DFS must supervise and monitor the child’s care in a foster \n16 \nhome.  At any time during the child’s placement that it appears that a child lacks proper care \n17 \nand management, the child must be removed from the home.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.060. \n18 \n  65.  Clark County caseworkers must have at least monthly face-to face contact with \n19 \nchildren in foster care.  At least bi-monthly, caseworkers must visit children in their foster \n20 \ncare placements.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.405(a)&(b).  \n21 \n22    66.  Clark County DFS must also provide support and services to the foster parent \n23  including responding in a timely manner to requests for assistance and establishing a program \n24 \nof respite care for foster parents to temporarily relieve them of the stresses and responsibilities \n25 \nof caring for children.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.077; Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 424.805. \n26 \n  67.  Clark County DFS must complete an assessment for each child in DFS custody \n27 \nat least semiannually.  The assessment must include the current level of functioning of the \n28 \n-19- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 20 of 73\n \n1  family, the current risk to the child if he were returned to the custody of his parent, and the \n2  services required to meet the child’s needs as set out in his case plan.  Nev. Admin. Code \n3 \nAnn. § 432B.420(1).  These assessments must be based, in part, on direct interviews with \n4 \nfamily members of the child, personal observations of interaction at home and in the \n5 \ncommunity between the child and family members, case histories, and medical records.  Nev. \n6 \nAdmin. Code Ann. § 432B.420(2). \n7 \n8      6.  Interstate placements of children\n9 \n  68.  If a child is placed with any person who resides outside of the state, the \n10 \nplacement must follow the procedures and criteria set forth in the Interstate Compact on \n11 \nPlacement of Children (“ICPC”).  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 127.330. \n12 \n  69.  In adopting and enacting the ICPC, the Nevada Legislature sought to ensure \n13 \nthat: (a) each child requiring placement receives the maximum opportunity to be placed in a \n14 \nsuitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and \n15 \nfacilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care; (b) the appropriate \n16 \n17  authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the \n18  circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable \n19 \nrequirements for the protection of the child; (c) the proper authorities of the state from which \n20 \nthe placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to \n21 \nevaluate a projected placement before it is made; and (d) appropriate jurisdictional \n22 \narrangements for the care of children are promoted.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §127.330.   \n23 \n  70.  The ICPC requires, among other things, that a child must not be sent to the \n24 \nreceiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state notify the sending \n25 \nagency, in writing, that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests \n26 \nof the child.  \n27 \n28 \n-20- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 21 of 73\n \n1    B.  Federal statutory framework \n2 \n1.  The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by \n3 \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997: Titles IV-B and IV-E of the \nSocial Security Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 622 et seq.; 671 et seq. \n4 \n \n5    71.  States that meet federally established child welfare standards in the day-to-day \n6 \noperation of their child welfare programs are eligible for federal child welfare funding under \n7 \nTitles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 622 et seq.; 671 et seq.  Nevada \n8 \nhas submitted a mandated State Plan describing how the State will assure compliance with \n9 \nfederal child welfare requirements under these titles and receives federal child welfare funds.  \n10 \n  72.  Federal child welfare mandates with which Nevada must comply include the \n11 \nfollowing: to place children only in settings that conform to national professional standards \n12 \nand are subject to a uniformly applied set of standards; to provide quality services that protect \n13 \nfoster children’s safety and health; to provide each child with a written case plan containing \n14 \n15  specified elements, and a case review system with specified elements; to place each child in a \n16  safe setting that is the least restrictive and most family like setting; to provide updated health \n17 \nand education records to foster parents or foster care providers at the time of placement; and \n18 \nto provide notice and a right to be heard to foster parents and any preadoptive parent or \n19 \nrelative providing care in any proceeding concerning the child.  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(10); \n20 \n671(16); 671(22); 675(1); 675(5); 675(5)(A); 675(5)(B); 675(5)(D); 675(5)(G); \n21 \n622(b)(10)(B)(ii).    \n22 \n23 \n2. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act \n(“CAPTA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq.\n24 \n \n25 \n  73.  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act \n26 \n(“CAPTA”), as codified at 42 U.S.C. §5101 et seq., provides federal grants to states to assist \n27 \nthem in supporting their programs for abused and neglected children.  To receive federal \n28 \n-21- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 22 of 73\n \n1  money under CAPTA, each state must submit a State Plan outlining the areas of child \n2  protective services the state intends to address with the funding, and it must ensure that it is \n3 \ncomplying with the statutory provision. 42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(1)(A); 42 U.S.C. § \n4 \n5106a(b)(2)(A)(ix).  CAPTA specifically requires that every abused or neglected child who is \n5 \nthe subject of a judicial proceeding must be represented by a properly trained guardian ad \n6 \nlitem.  42 U.S.C. §5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii). \n7 \n  74.  The guardian ad litem may be an attorney or a court-appointed special \n8 \nadvocate, or both.  Since the original enactment of this federal mandate, Congress has \n9 \namended the provision several times to describe explicitly and amplify the duties of the \n10 \n11  guardian ad litem.  For example, the guardian ad litem must obtain a first-hand, clear \n12  understanding of the situation and needs of the child and make recommendations to the court \n13 \nconcerning the best interests of the child.  42 U.S.C. §5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii).  \n14 \n  75.  Nevada receives federal funding pursuant to CAPTA.  State DCFS is \n15 \nresponsible for administering any federal funds, including CAPTA funds, for child welfare \n16 \nservices and ensuring county compliance with federal mandates.  Nev. Rev. Stat. § \n17 \n432B.180(1).  It is required to plan, coordinate and monitor the delivery of child welfare \n18 \nservices provided throughout the state, as well as evaluate all child welfare services and \n19 \nwithhold money from any agency that is not complying with its regulations.  Nev. Rev. Stat. § \n20 \n432B.180(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180(6).  State DCFS is also required to promulgate \n21 \n22  regulations establishing uniform standards for child welfare services provided in the state.  \n23  Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.190(1). \n24 \n3.

To receive those funds, \n3 \nstates must adhere to the minimum federal requirements according to the Social Security Act, \n4 \nits implementing regulations, C.F.R. §§ 430 et seq., and the Supremacy Clause of the United \n5 \nStates Constitution. \n6 \n  77.  Federal law requires states to cover certain mandatory services, including Early \n7 \nand Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (“EPSDT”) services, for Medicaid-eligible \n8 \nchildren under the age of 21.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(4)(B).  \n9 \nUnder EPSDT, states are required to provide screening services to identify defects, \n10 \n11  conditions, and illness.  States must then provide the necessary diagnostic and treatment \n12  services to correct or ameliorate those conditions, whether or not such services are covered \n13 \nunder the state plan.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r); 42 C.F.R. § 441.56(b). \n14 \n  78.  Nevada has chosen to participate in the Medicaid program.  Under its Medicaid \n15 \nprogram, Nevada must provide EPSDT services to eligible children under the age of 21. \n16 \nChildren under the age of 21 who are in foster care are eligible for Medicaid.  Accordingly, \n17 \nNevada is mandated to provide EPSDT services to these children.  \n18 \nVI. \n19 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS FOR NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n20 \nClark K. \n21 \n22    79.  Clark is a seventeen-year-old youth who came into the legal custody of Clark \n23  County DFS in July 2003.  Prior to that time, the department had received ten reports of abuse \n24 \nor neglect involving Clark and/or his siblings.  \n25 \n  80.  While in DFS custody, Clark has been placed in inappropriate and dangerous \n26 \nplacements, which have been harmful to his physical, mental, and emotional well-being.  He \n27 \nhas been denied adequate food, clothing and shelter; subjected to frequent changes in \n28 \n-23- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 24 of 73\n \n1  placement; denied necessary medical and mental health care; denied an education and special \n2  education services; separated from his siblings; denied other necessary services to meet his \n3 \nneeds; and denied access to any sort of representation by an attorney or guardian ad litem. \n4 \n  81.  In September 1999, Clark’s mother moved from Las Vegas to Texas, and took \n5 \nClark with her.  Clark and his mother lived with approximately ten other relatives in a two-\n6 \nbedroom trailer.  Most of their food came out of dumpsters behind grocery stores because \n7 \nClark’s mother spent her money on drugs.  About a year later, Clark’s mother took him with \n8 \nher to live in Virginia.  In Virginia, he was often left with strangers while his mother was off \n9 \nbuying, dealing, and taking illegal drugs.  Clark missed many days of school due to his \n10 \n11  mother’s absence, neglect, and instability.  As a result of these absences, Clark was held back \n12  at least one grade.    \n13 \n  82.  In December 2001, Clark and his mother returned to Texas.  Subsequently, \n14 \nClark contacted his grandparents in Las Vegas and pleaded with them to rescue him from the \n15 \nunsafe and unhealthy living arrangement in Texas.  His grandmother drove to Texas, and \n16 \nbrought Clark back to live with her and his grandfather in Las Vegas. \n17 \n  83.  Following Clark’s arrival at their home, his grandparents contacted Clark \n18 \nCounty DFS and shared information about the unsafe living environment Clark had endured \n19 \nin Texas.  At the advice of DFS, Clark’s grandparents first became his legal guardians and \n20 \nlater became licensed foster parents.  During the entire time that Clark lived with his \n21 \n22  grandparents, he attended school regularly, got good grades, and was in good health.  Clark’s \n23  younger brother also lived with him and his grandparents for much of the time.   \n24 \n  84.  On August 29, 2003, Clark was adjudicated a neglected child and placed in the \n25 \nlegal custody of Clark County DFS.  DFS continued his placement in the home of his \n26 \ngrandparents.  Clark did not receive notice of the adjudication hearing on August 29, nor was \n27 \nhe represented by an attorney or guardian ad litem.  Although Clark’s grandparents had \n28 \n-24- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 25 of 73\n \n1  discussed Clark’s need for a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) with his caseworker, \n2  he was never provided one.   \n3 \n  85.  On September 17, 2003, a dispositional hearing was held on Clark’s Petition \n4 \nfor Neglect.  Clark’s grandparents went to the courthouse to attend the hearing, but were \n5 \nrefused entry into the courtroom.  Clark’s caseworker knew that Clark’s grandparents were at \n6 \nthe courthouse and that they wished to attend the hearing and provide input, but they were \n7 \ndenied an opportunity to express Clark’s wishes or explain their concerns for his safety should \n8 \nhe be returned to his mother in Texas.  Clark’s caseworker did not notify Clark about the \n9 \nhearing, tell him the purpose of the hearing, or ask him whether he wanted to go back to \n10 \n11  Texas.  Clark was given no opportunity to speak to the court or have anyone else represent his \n12  interests.  Had he been asked about his wishes, or allowed to speak at the hearing, he would \n13 \nhave told the court that he absolutely did not want to go back and live with his mother in \n14 \nTexas and would have explained the reasons he was afraid to be placed with her.   \n15 \n  86.  Subsequently, Clark’s caseworker told his grandparents and Clark that the \n16 \ncourt had decided that he should be placed back with his mother in Texas.  Clark’s \n17 \ngrandparents were strongly opposed to this decision and expressed their concerns to Clark \n18 \nCounty DFS.  They sent letters to DFS caseworkers and administrators describing their \n19 \nconcerns regarding Clark’s safety and health should he be returned to Texas.  Clark County \n20 \nDFS never responded to their letters or addressed their concerns. \n21 \n22    87.  Throughout October 2003, Clark County DFS attempted to get Clark’s \n23  grandparents to disenroll him from school and take him to the airport to go to Texas.  They \n24 \nrefused.  \n25 \n  88.  On October 21, 2003, a Clark County DFS caseworker spoke to Clark for the \n26 \nfirst time about his impending placement back with his mother in Texas.  The caseworker told \n27 \nClark that he had spoken to Clark’s mother and that she reported that she had a job, was not \n28 \n-25- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 26 of 73\n \n1  using drugs, and could take care of him.  Clark responded: “It’s horrible down there… I know \n2  my mom… she can’t keep a steady job … she has been on drugs since I was little… I know \n3 \nwhat it’s like down there.  I don’t want to go.”   \n4 \n  89.  Despite Clark’s strong desire to remain with his grandparents, his articulated \n5 \nconcerns about going to live with his mother in Texas, and his history of neglect in Texas, \n6 \nClark County DFS nonetheless forced him to return to Texas.  In late October 2003, Clark’s \n7 \ncaseworker picked Clark up at his house, drove him to the airport, walked him to security, and \n8 \nput him on a flight to Houston, Texas.   \n9 \n  90.  Clark’s caseworker failed to complete an assessment of his safety before \n10 \n11  returning him to his mother’s custody.  The caseworker made no attempt to confirm what \n12  Clark’s mother had told him during their brief phone conversations.  He did not contact her \n13 \nalleged employer, her alleged landlord, or the local Texas child protective services.  Despite \n14 \nher years of drug abuse, he did not require that she submit verification of successfully \n15 \ncompleting treatment or that she submit to a drug screen.  He also did not conduct any \n16 \ncriminal background check with Texas authorities.  In addition, Clark County DFS failed to \n17 \ncomply with the requirements of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, to \n18 \nwhich both Texas and Nevada are signators.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§127.320-350; Tex. Fam. \n19 \nCode § 162.101 et seq.    \n20 \n  91.  Had the caseworker conducted a reasonable investigation, he would have \n21 \n22  learned that Clark’s mother was on probation for burglary, had been without a job for a very \n23  long time, and had no suitable housing.  She was sharing an overcrowded trailer with her \n24 \nalcoholic parents, and was continuing to abuse drugs and alcohol. \n25 \n  92.  After sending Clark to Texas, Clark County DFS essentially washed their \n26 \nhands of him altogether.  They made no efforts to determine whether he was safe with his \n27 \nmother, nor did they follow up with anyone in Texas to ensure that his needs were being met.   \n28 \n-26- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 27 of 73\n \n1    93.  Once again, Clark led a miserable life in Texas.  He initially lived with his \n2  mother, maternal grandmother, and many others in a filthy trailer.  At any given time, there \n3 \nwere at least eight people sharing the trailer with five or six dogs.  Animal feces were littered \n4 \nthroughout.  Clark slept on a filthy mattress on a bunk bed that he shared with his \n5 \ngrandmother, or he slept on the floor.  Clark was surrounded by drug use and drug dealing.  \n6 \nHis mother used and sold everything from marijuana to crack in Clark’s presence.  His \n7 \nrelatives stole his possessions (including clothes, shoes, socks, hats, CDs, a CD player, a \n8 \nguitar, a backpack, and a bike), and sold them for drug money.   \n9 \n  94.  Clark often went several days without food.  Although his mother was \n10 \n11  receiving food stamps for him, she traded them for drugs.  She and her parents frequently dug \n12  food out of dumpsters for themselves and Clark to eat.  At other times he would only have a \n13 \nfew crackers and applesauce.  Much of the time, his only meal of the day was the free lunch \n14 \nhe received at school.   \n15 \n  95.  For the year and a half he was left in Texas, Clark was moved around among \n16 \nvarious family members, moving about twelve times.  Most of the time they moved from one \n17 \ntrailer park to another.  At one point they were all living out of a truck with a camper shell on \n18 \nthe back.  During most of his time in Texas, Clark was virtually abandoned by his mother.  \n19 \nShe would frequently disappear on drug binges; she never held down a job; and she never \n20 \nprovided for his basic needs.   \n21 \n22    96.  Although Clark was getting A’s and B’s in school when he lived with his \n23  grandparents in Las Vegas, upon placement with his mother in Texas, his grades plummeted.  \n24 \nIn some of the places he was taken to live, he had no transportation to school.  He also never \n25 \nreceived the special education services to which he was entitled based on previous \n26 \nassessments and an IEP adopted while attending Clark County School District.  In addition, \n27 \nduring the entire time he was in Texas, his mother never provided him with medication to \n28 \n-27- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 28 of 73\n \n1  address his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which made it even more difficult for him \n2  to concentrate in school  \n3 \n  97.  Finally, in the spring of 2005, Clark managed to get in touch with his \n4 \ngrandmother in Las Vegas.  With help from his sister, Clark took a Greyhound bus back to his \n5 \ngrandparents in Las Vegas.   \n6 \n  98.  Shortly after returning to Las Vegas, Clark’s family contacted Clark County \n7 \nDFS to tell them Clark had returned to live with his grandparents.  Subsequently, DFS \n8 \nattempted to locate Clark’s mother, but was not successful.  Despite the traumatic events \n9 \nClark experienced in Texas, DFS made no efforts to provide him with counseling or other \n10 \n11  services.  Clark County DFS also failed to provide him with any educational services to make \n12  up for the significant time he was not in school.  In the absence of any services or assistance \n13 \nfrom DFS, Clark and his grandparents researched various training programs and decided that \n14 \nClark should attend Job Corps.  \n15 \n  99.  Clark was accepted at the Job Corps in Reno, and began living there and \n16 \nattending classes and vocational training.  However, on or around March 15, 2006, Clark went \n17 \nmissing.  Although Job Corps officials notified Clark County DFS of Clark’s disappearance, \n18 \nlittle or no attempts were made to locate him.  Even after the court directed DFS to do \n19 \neverything in their power to find Clark, DFS took few, if any, steps to determine Clark’s \n20 \nwhereabouts.  At one point, Clark called the DFS hotline and told them he was ready to go \n21 \n22  home to his grandparents, but DFS failed to take timely action to help bring him back to a safe \n23  placement.   \n24 \n  100.  Clark lived on the streets in Reno for about three months, until he eventually \n25 \nlearned about a program called “Home Free” sponsored by the National Runaway \n26 \nSwitchboard.  He was provided with a free one-way Greyhound ticket back to his \n27 \n28 \n-28- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 29 of 73\n \n1  grandparents in Las Vegas.  He returned to their care on May 19, 2006, and has been living \n2  with them ever since.   \n3 \n  101.  Since returning to Las Vegas, Clark has received almost no independent living \n4 \nservices, or any other kind of services from Clark County DFS.  His caseworker has been \n5 \nunresponsive to multiple calls from Clark’s grandparents to follow up on securing needed \n6 \nservices.  Clark is afraid to go back to school because he is now so far behind.  He still has \n7 \nsignificant unmet mental health needs, and lives with the fear that DFS could again take him \n8 \nfrom his grandparents and send him to an unsafe placement against his will.  He has difficulty \n9 \ntrusting adults or believing that anyone cares about him.  He worries that people are like his \n10 \n11  relatives in Texas – just waiting to do him in.  \n12  A. Children\n13 \n  102.  Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. are siblings - four boys and one girl, \n14 \nages eight, seven, five, four, and one, respectively.  They have been in the custody of Clark \n15 \nCounty DFS since December 2004.  Their baby brother, Jerome, died in a DFS-licensed foster \n16 \nhome on April 3, 2005, at the age of 14 months.  \n17 \n  103.  While in DFS custody, these five children have been placed in multiple \n18 \ninappropriate and dangerous placements that have been harmful to their physical, mental, and \n19 \nemotional well-being.  They have been placed in a restrictive, overcrowded, and dangerous \n20 \nchild care facility (Child Haven) for almost a year; subjected to further emotional and \n21 \n22  physical abuse and neglect while in foster and shelter homes; placed in shelter and foster \n23  homes that lacked the information and services to care adequately for their basic needs; \n24 \ndenied treatment and care to address their history of abuse and neglect; denied visitation and \n25 \ncontact with relatives; denied representation by either a guardian ad litem or an attorney \n26 \nduring their first year in foster care; and separated from each other for long periods of time.   \n27 \n28 \n-29- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 30 of 73\n \n1    104.  The A. children first came into foster care after the youngest sibling, King, \n2  tested positive for drugs when he was born in December 2004.  The children were initially \n3 \ntaken to Child Haven for a day, and then were split up and placed in three different DFS-\n4 \nlicensed foster and shelter homes.  The three oldest children were placed in the foster home of \n5 \nJoan Smith.  About a month later, Caleb and Jerome were moved into the Smith home with \n6 \ntheir siblings.  King was placed in a different foster home, separated from his siblings.  \n7 \nWhile in the Smith home, the children were physically and emotionally abused as a result of \n8 \nClark County DFS’s failure to provide adequate training, supervision, and support to foster \n9 \nparents; failure to investigate reports of abuse and neglect; and failure to remove children \n10 \n11  from dangerous placements.   \n12    105.  Within their first month of placement, Ms. Smith had difficulty caring for the \n13 \nfive children who at the time ranged in age from one year to six years of age.  During this \n14 \ntime, Ms. Smith was also having problems with her troubled adopted daughter, who was \n15 \nregularly running away from home.  In February or March 2005, Ms. Smith began making \n16 \nrepeated requests to Clark County DFS, both verbally and in writing, to remove the children \n17 \nfrom her home.  Upon information and belief, DFS failed to respond to these requests and \n18 \nfailed to provide Ms. Smith with any supportive services to help her care for the A. children.   \n19 \n  106.  Clark County DFS also failed to investigate multiple reports of abuse and \n20 \nneglect while the children were living at the Smith home.  While visiting Jerome in the \n21 \n22  hospital in February 2005, the children’s biological father observed bruises on Jerome.  \n23  During another visit with all of the children, they told their father that they were being \n24 \nmistreated at the Smith home by both the foster mother and her adopted daughter, and that \n25 \nMs. Smith would hit infant Jerome.  Although the children’s father made multiple reports to \n26 \nDFS of the abuse occurring in the Smith home, DFS did not investigate the reports, and let all \n27 \n28 \n-30- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 31 of 73\n \n1  five children remain in the home until Jerome was tragically scalded to death on April 3, \n2  2005. \n3 \n  107.  Despite the reports of abuse in the home and Ms. Smith’s requests to have the \n4 \nA. children removed, Clark County DFS placed another infant in Ms. Smith’s home in \n5 \nFebruary or March 2005.  At this time, Ms. Smith had seven children in her home: the five A. \n6 \nchildren, her adopted twelve-year-old daughter, and the new infant.   \n7 \n  108.  When she was originally licensed for foster care in August 2002, Ms. Smith \n8 \nwas granted a license for only three female children, ages 11-18 years.  On April 16, 2004, \n9 \nMs. Smith was issued a Group Foster Home license for four male or female children, ages 0-\n10 \n11  17 years.  On its face, this license noted “there is only one bedroom allocated to foster \n12  children in this home.”  Effective September 20, 2004, her capacity was increased to five \n13 \nbeds, and effective January 4, 2005, her capacity was increased to six beds.  On April 1, 2005, \n14 \njust two days before Jerome’s death, her shelter care license for six beds was renewed.   \n15 \n  109.  Clark County DFS’s increases in the licensed capacity of Ms. Smith’s home \n16 \ndid not take into consideration her training, abilities, or demonstrated record of caring for \n17 \nsuch a large number of foster children.  Rather, it was based solely on the need for more \n18 \nshelter care beds in the county.   \n19 \n  110.  On April 3, 2005, Ms. Smith left the A. children at home alone with her \n20 \nteenage adoptive daughter.  While Ms. Smith was at the hospital with her other foster infant, \n21 \n22  fourteen-month-old Jerome was scalded to death in the bathtub at the Smith home.  At least \n23  two of Jerome’s siblings witnessed his death.  \n24 \n  111.  On November 8, 2005, the City of North Las Vegas filed criminal charges \n25 \nagainst Ms. Smith related to Jerome’s death.  Smith ultimately pled guilty and is currently \n26 \nserving her sentence of a few months in a Clark County facility.  Her foster care license was \n27 \nrevoked.  \n28 \n-31- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 32 of 73\n \n1    112.  The day after Jerome’s death, his five surviving siblings were placed at Child \n2  Haven.  A few days later, all of the siblings except for King, who remained at Child Haven, \n3 \nwere placed in another foster home.  During their first week at this home, the children were \n4 \nleft home alone at night multiple times.  They were subsequently removed from this \n5 \nplacement after less than two weeks and returned to Child Haven where they remained from \n6 \nApril 2005 through May 2006 – over a year and a month.   \n7 \n  113.  For the thirteen months the A. children were in Child Haven, they were subject \n8 \nto restrictive, overcrowded, oppressive conditions, and denied necessary services, resulting in \n9 \ndeterioration of their mental and physical health and well-being.  At the time when they most \n10 \n11  needed a caring environment, they were forced to give up their personal clothes and \n12  belongings; were required to wear communal clothing; were not allowed to attend school in \n13 \nthe community for at least ten months; were given only limited visiting time with parents and \n14 \nrelatives; and were subjected to a point-based discipline system inappropriate for children of \n15 \ntheir young ages — conditions that have lead Child Haven to be described as a “junior \n16 \nprison.”   \n17 \n  114.  After King was moved back to the infant building at Child Haven, he \n18 \ndeveloped serious respiratory problems.  His condition was so severe that he was not allowed \n19 \nto go outside, and had to have breathing treatments twice a day.  His condition persisted for \n20 \nover nine months before he was taken outside Child Haven to see a specialist.   \n21 \n22    115.  At Child Haven the A. children were denied needed mental health services to \n23  help them cope with witnessing the death of their infant brother, as well as the abuse and \n24 \nneglect they have experienced in their short lives.  Jalen is the only child who has received \n25 \nany mental health services, and the little counseling he was provided at Child Haven was on \n26 \nan “as needed” basis and was inadequate to meet his needs.  When the children’s aunt Tarrah \n27 \nasked Child Haven staff why the children were not receiving mental health services following \n28 \n-32- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 33 of 73\n \n1  the death of their infant brother, she was told by staff that Child Haven is “not a placement,” \n2  and because of this DFS does not have to provide them with any services while they are there.  \n3 \n  116.  The children received inadequate educational services while at Child Haven.  \n4 \nJalen and Sia, the two older children, never attended school in the community during the \n5 \nentire year and a month they were placed at Child Haven; they were only allowed to attend \n6 \nthe on-site school with other children living at Child Haven.  Caleb and Roshaun were finally \n7 \nable to attend a school in the community for a half-day after they had been in Child Haven for \n8 \nover ten months.   \n9 \n  117.  Tarrah visited the children at Child Haven about every other weekend from \n10 \n11  April 2005 through March 2006.  However, in the Spring of 2006, a County DFS caseworker \n12  informed Tarrah that she could no longer visit with her nieces and nephews because it would \n13 \ngive them “false hope.”  The caseworker did not allow Tarrah a goodbye visit with the \n14 \nchildren nor did she allow Tarrah to explain to the children that she was not abandoning them, \n15 \nbut rather it was the department’s decision to terminate her visits.  The children now have no \n16 \nstable adult figure in their lives.   \n17 \n  118.  In May 2006, the children were moved from Child Haven to another foster \n18 \nhome.  This is the fifth placement change for Jalen, Sia, and Roshaun since they entered Clark \n19 \nCounty DFS custody in December 2004.  It is Caleb’s fourth placement change, and King’s \n20 \nthird placement change since entering foster care in December 2004, and they are all at risk of \n21 \n22  future placement changes, including being returned once again to Child Haven.   \n23  B. Children  \n24 \n  119.  Seven-year-old Summer, five-year-old Frank, and four-year-old Toni B. are \n25 \nsiblings.  They have been in the legal custody of Clark County DFS since October 2002.  \n26 \n  120.  While in foster care, the B. children have been placed with a series of foster \n27 \nparents who were given little background information about the children and were not trained \n28 \n-33- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 34 of 73\n \n1  or supported to meet the children’s special needs.  As a direct and foreseeable result, the \n2  children changed placements many times, with Frank and Summer experiencing between five \n3 \nand seven placements within three months.  The children were also physically and \n4 \nemotionally abused in at least one foster home, and have been placed at Child Haven several \n5 \ntimes.  In addition, Clark County DFS failed to conduct a proper investigation of reports of \n6 \nabuse of Summer and Frank, and failed to provide the children with needed health and \n7 \neducational services.  For the first year that the children were in DFS custody, they were not \n8 \nrepresented by a guardian ad litem. \n9 \n  121.  On October 3, 2002, Clark County DFS assumed legal custody of then eleven-\n10 \n11  month-old Toni, three-and-a-half-year-old Summer, and two-year-old Frank when the \n12  children were brought to Child Haven by a baby sitter who reported that the mother had \n13 \nabandoned them.  DFS petitioned the juvenile court to find the children abused and neglected \n14 \nbased upon the mother’s history of substance abuse, including having taken \n15 \nmethamphetamine during her pregnancy with Toni, and the father’s incarceration.  The \n16 \nchildren were placed in the DFS licensed shelter home of Marilyn Paikai, where they lived for \n17 \nthe next six months.  \n18 \n  122.  Upon their entry into foster care, all three children demonstrated multiple \n19 \nspecial needs.  Frank suffered anxiety attacks and night terrors, and often banged his head \n20 \nfrom one side of the crib to the other in the middle of the night.  His language skills were not \n21 \n22  developmentally appropriate for a child his age.  Summer was physically aggressive toward \n23  her younger siblings, and her other behaviors suggested that she had been the victim of sexual \n24 \nabuse.  One of Summer’s foster parents took her to the doctor after she complained of \n25 \n“burning” on her “bottom,” and the examination revealed that she had genital warts.  \n26 \nAlthough her therapist subsequently reported to Clark County DFS that she suspected \n27 \nSummer had been sexually abused, DFS never investigated these concerns or reports.  Toni \n28 \n-34- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 35 of 73\n \n1  was underweight and emotionally disturbed.  Her behavior was self-abusive - pulling her hair \n2  out, banging her head on the walls and floor, and biting her arms.  One mental health therapist \n3 \ndescribed little Toni as “a bundle of raw nerves.”  Others suspected she suffered from Down \n4 \nSyndrome.  She was hypertonic and was very difficult to console and relax.  \n5 \n  123.  On April 9, 2003, all three children were removed from Mrs. Paikai’s \n6 \nshelter home, supposedly to be placed in a permanent placement.  However, they stayed at \n7 \ntheir next foster care placement with the Jackson family for less than seven weeks before \n8 \nbeing moved again.  At the time the children came to live with them, the Jacksons were newly \n9 \nlicensed and had recently completed the foster parent training program.  They had never cared \n10 \n11  for any other foster children, and had no experience or training in caring for children with the \n12  extent of special needs of Toni, Summer, and Frank.  The Jacksons also had two young \n13 \nchildren of their own - ages three and six. \n14 \n  124.  Almost from the first day the children were placed in the Jackson foster home, \n15 \nthe foster parents began calling the caseworker asking for help with their care of the children.  \n16 \nThey did not know how to respond to the children’s behaviors.  Summer, for example, threw \n17 \ntemper tantrums, forced herself to vomit, and attacked her younger brother.  \n18 \n  125.  Clark County DFS did not return the foster parents’ calls nor did they provide \n19 \nany supportive services that might have enabled the Jacksons to continue caring for the \n20 \nchildren and prevented another disruption in the children’s placement.  \n21 \n22    126.  On May 26, 2003, the Jackson foster father called and asked Mrs. Paikai, the \n23  former shelter care mother, to provide them with respite by taking the children for the day.  \n24 \nShe agreed and the foster father dropped off the children at her home.  When the time came \n25 \nfor the foster father to pick up the children later that day, he refused to do so.  \n26 \n  127.  Mrs. Paikai then called Child Haven and reported that she had the children \n27 \nback in her home but had bed space only for one.  Child Haven staff told Mrs. Paikai to keep \n28 \n-35- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 36 of 73\n \n1  the children and call back on Tuesday after the holiday weekend.  The children remained in \n2  Mrs. Paikai’s home until the following Friday when the caseworker picked up Summer and \n3 \nFrank, and decided that Toni would remain with Mrs. Paikai.   \n4 \n  128.  Toni remained in Mrs. Paikai’s shelter home for more than two years – until \n5 \nAugust 2005 - when she was returned to her mother on a trial basis.  During the entire time \n6 \nToni was placed with Mrs. Paikai, her Clark County DFS caseworker made only one visit to \n7 \nthe foster home to check on the well-being of Toni.   \n8 \n  129.  For the next three months, between June and August 2003, Summer and Frank \n9 \nwere moved every two weeks from one foster home to another.  Altogether they were moved \n10 \n11  five or six times in less than three months.  After being moved five or six times, they went \n12  back to Child Haven for six weeks. \n13 \n  130.  In each home selected by Clark County DFS, the foster parents were not \n14 \nadequately trained nor did they have the experience and skills to provide the type of intensive \n15 \ncare that Summer and Frank required.  \n16 \n  131.  Frank was physically abused by the foster mother in one of the foster homes \n17 \nthrough which County DFS shuttled Summer and Frank between June and August 2003.  In \n18 \nJuly 2003, during a visit with their biological mother, the children told her that the foster \n19 \nmother was hitting them.  Frank pulled down his pants and showed his mother a black and \n20 \nblue bruise on his left hip the size of a baseball.  The mother called the caseworker in and told \n21 \n22  her about the bruise and what the children had said. \n23    132.  Following the mother’s report of abuse in the foster home, the caseworker \n24 \nfailed to take pictures of Frank’s injury.  The caseworker did not refer the report of abuse to \n25 \nan investigator, but instead took Summer and Frank out one at a time to talk to them.  After \n26 \nthese conversations with the children and without conducting any investigation, the \n27 \ncaseworker took the children back to the same foster home the children had complained \n28 \n-36- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 37 of 73\n \n1  about.  Upon returning the children to this foster home, the caseworker merely reminded the \n2  foster parent not to hit kids. \n3 \n  133.  Several days after the children reported abuse in the foster home, the foster \n4 \nmother called and admitted to Mrs. Paikai that she had hit Summer; she insisted that Summer \n5 \nneeded to be on medication to deal with her out of control behaviors.  She also admitted that \n6 \nshe punished Summer by making her lay in her bed for four or five hours during the day. \n7 \n  134.  The very next morning after the phone call from the foster mother, Mrs. Paikai \n8 \ncalled the children’s caseworker.  She told her about the conversation she had with the foster \n9 \nmother and expressed her concerns for the safety of the children.  Following this call, the \n10 \n11  caseworker removed Summer and Frank from the foster home - seven days after Frank \n12  showed the bruise to his mother and she reported it to the caseworker.   \n13 \n  135.  Upon removing the children from the abusive foster home, the caseworker \n14 \nasked Mrs. Paikai to keep them.  However, Mrs. Paikai had no bed space available and was at \n15 \nher licensed capacity.  Nonetheless, with the plea of the caseworker that there was nowhere \n16 \nelse for the children to go, she agreed to keep them until the worker could find another home.  \n17 \nWhile they were back with Mrs. Paikai, Summer and Frank told her that the foster mother \n18 \nthreatened them with being sent back to Child Haven and told Summer that if she did not stop \n19 \ncrying, staff there would pull her eyes out.   \n20 \n  136.  Subsequently, Frank and Summer were placed with Mrs. Paikai’s sister who \n21 \n22  was a licensed foster parent.  In the new foster home, the children demonstrated much of the \n23  same behaviors and special needs that they had shown in the previous homes.  Their new \n24 \nfoster mother repeatedly called the caseworker for support with the care of the children but \n25 \nher calls, too, were never returned.  For the entire two weeks the children were in this foster \n26 \nhome no one from Clark County DFS came to check on the children or responded to the foster \n27 \nmother’s pleas for help.   \n28 \n-37- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 38 of 73\n \n1    137.  With no support, assistance, or response to her pleas for help, the foster mother \n2  took the children to a therapist’s office in search of some assistance.  When the therapist \n3 \ncalled the caseworker, she told her to take the children back to Child Haven.  Following these \n4 \ninstructions, the therapist transported the children back to Child Haven, where they remained \n5 \nfor another five weeks.   \n6 \n  138.  In August 2003, Summer and Frank were placed in the therapeutic foster home \n7 \nof Rosie and Robert Beck.  They lived in this home for two years. \n8 \n  139.  At the end of August 2005,Clark County DFS returned all three children to \n9 \ntheir mother — while maintaining legal custody.  DFS did not perform the requisite safety \n10 \n11  assessment prior to placing the children with their mother.  Indeed, at the time the decision \n12  was made, the caseworker stated that she was “95% certain that placement back with the \n13 \nmother will fail.”   \n14 \n  140.  During the “trial” time with their mother, the children’s educational, mental \n15 \nhealth, and medical needs went unmet.  For the entire time that Toni lived with her mother she \n16 \nwas not enrolled in, nor did she attend one day of, school.  She had previously been enrolled \n17 \nat the early Program for Delayed Children of Clark County, and was receiving special \n18 \neducation services, weekly speech therapy, and occupational therapy.  While living with her \n19 \nmother, she did not receive any of the special education or related services she had been \n20 \nreceiving.  As a result, Toni’s speech, behavior, and educational progress deteriorated \n21 \n22  significantly.  Her speech became unintelligible.  Her medical needs also went unmet.  \n23    141.  In October 2005, while back with her mother, Clark County DFS received a \n24 \nreport that Summer had a suspicious burn on her thigh.  Upon information and belief, this \n25 \nreport was not properly investigated.  School authorities also reported concerns about \n26 \nSummer, and that she was missing many days of school.  On several occasions during this \n27 \n28 \n-38- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 39 of 73\n \n1  “trial visit” with their mother, the children were caught in the middle of domestic violence \n2  between their mother and her boyfriend.   \n3 \n  142.  On January 6, 2006, the trial placement with the children’s mother was \n4 \nabruptly ended, and Toni, Summer, and Frank were returned to foster care.  Upon information \n5 \nand belief, the removal of the children was prompted by the mother’s failing a drug test and \n6 \ncalls from Summer’s school reporting that the children were being left alone.  \n7 \n  143.  The return of the children to foster care was handled in a manner inconsistent \n8 \nwith the safety, needs, and well-being of the children and in violation of professional \n9 \nstandards and common sense.  After a loud and disturbing argument and struggle with their \n10 \n11  mother in front of the B. children, the caseworker put the children in her car.  She then called \n12  Summer and Frank’s former foster parent, Rosie Beck, and asked her to meet her at major \n13 \nintersection in Las Vegas.  The caseworker then drove into a parking lot and handed off the \n14 \nchildren to Mrs. Beck.  Summer refused to get out of the car until the caseworker told her that \n15 \nshe would be taken to Child Haven if she did not go with Mrs. Beck.  The caseworker \n16 \nprovided the foster mother with no paperwork or authorization to care for the children.  \n17 \n  144.  Upon the children’s return to foster care in January 2006, the Clark County \n18 \nDFS caseworker did not contact Mrs. Paikai to ask if she would resume care of Toni and her \n19 \nsiblings.  DFS refused to place Toni in the foster home in which she had spent most of her \n20 \nlife, despite the repeated requests of Mrs. Paikai.  Instead, the agency placed the children with \n21 \n22  foster parents who are in their sixties and have three other special needs children.  Despite the \n23  advice of Toni’s physician that it was in Toni’s best interest to continue contact with Mrs. \n24 \nPaikai and her husband, DFS has cut off all contact between Toni and the Paikais. \n25 \nDonna C. \n26 \n  145.  Five-year-old Donna C. has been in the legal custody of Clark County DFS \n27 \nsince December 2004.  She is currently placed in a DFS licensed foster home. \n28 \n-39- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 40 of 73\n \n1    146.  Since Clark County DFS assumed custody of Donna, she has been denied \n2  necessary and appropriate medical, dental, and mental health care; removed from a foster \n3 \nhome in which she was receiving exemplary care; and subjected to mental and emotional \n4 \nharm.  In addition, she has at no time been represented by a guardian ad litem or attorney.  \n5 \nShe has had no legal representation at court hearings, staffings, Child and Family Team \n6 \nmeetings, or in any other decision-making meetings held by DFS at which decisions were \n7 \nmade about her placement, treatment, and/or permanent plan.    \n8 \n  147.  Donna was removed from the custody of her mother and placed in foster care \n9 \ndue to her mother’s addiction to drugs, multiple child molestation allegations her mother had \n10 \n11  made against multiple partners, lack of stable living accommodations, her mother’s criminal \n12  history (which included serving four years in federal penitentiary for the sale and possession \n13 \nof cocaine), and a Florida juvenile court’s removal of Donna’s older sister from her mother’s \n14 \ncare and custody.   \n15 \n  148.  In 2005, Donna was returned to her mother on a trial visit with Clark County \n16 \nDFS retaining legal custody.  Upon information and belief, before Donna was reunited with \n17 \nher mother, DFS failed to complete a safety and risk assessment.  After Donna’s placement \n18 \nback with her mother, DFS failed to make regular visits to the home and monitor her care, \n19 \nsafety, and well-being.  Upon information and belief, DFS also failed to provide services to \n20 \nDonna and failed to continually assess whether her mother had achieved the goals and \n21 \n22  objectives of the case plan.  Shortly after Donna was placed back with the mother, her \n23  assigned caseworker left or was reassigned and no other DFS caseworker was assigned to \n24 \nDonna’s case for several months.  \n25 \n  149.  While Donna was living with her mother, her mother stole a car, left Nevada \n26 \nwith Donna, and began traveling throughout the United States and Canada.  For three or more \n27 \nmonths, Donna lived in the stolen car with her mother and was subjected to a series of \n28 \n-40- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 41 of 73\n \n1  traumatizing events.  Her mother drove from one state to another, evading authorities and \n2  engaging in illegal conduct including the purchase of illegal drugs.  Donna was often forced \n3 \nto accompany her mother into truck stop bathrooms in which she witnessed her mother buy, \n4 \nsell, smoke, snort, and inject drugs.  Donna also endured mental torment and torture.  She was \n5 \nterrorized by her mother’s paranoia and began herself to believe and participate in it.  For \n6 \nexample, she was not permitted to drink water because her mother was convinced that all \n7 \nwater was poisoned by the “cult.”  She frequently had Donna crawl under the car to look for a \n8 \nglobal tracking device she believed the “cult” had put there.  \n9 \n  150.  During the months Donna was with her mother, she went without food and \n10 \n11  water for long periods of time.  She developed an eating disorder characterized by excessive \n12  chewing of her food, failing to swallow it, and then gagging.  She was confined to the car for \n13 \nlong periods of time and denied exercise and play.   \n14 \n  151.  While in the care of her mother, Donna was repeatedly exposed to domestic \n15 \nviolence in which she was often caught in the middle of physical fights between her mother \n16 \nand her mother’s boyfriend.  From a very early age, Donna’s mother told her that she had \n17 \nbeen sexually molested by members of the “cult.”  \n18 \n  152.  As a result of her months of living with a severely emotionally disturbed and \n19 \ndrug-addicted mother, Donna suffered long-lasting harm the full impact of which is not yet \n20 \nknown.  \n21 \n22    153.  In December 2005, Donna’s mother was arrested in New Mexico and charged \n23  with auto theft.  Law enforcement authorities in New Mexico discovered that Donna was in \n24 \nthe custody of Clark County DFS and made arrangements to have her returned to Las Vegas.   \n25 \n  154.  On December 12, 2005, Donna was returned to Las Vegas.  She was taken by a \n26 \nDFS caseworker from the airport directly to the foster home of Ernest and Jacquelyn Romero.  \n27 \nWhen she arrived at the Romero home, she had nothing but a small bag of severely worn \n28 \n-41- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 42 of 73\n \n1  clothing stained with cat urine and feces.  She had no toys, and not even an extra pair of clean \n2  underwear. \n3 \n  155.  Since County DFS was not visiting Donna while she was placed with her \n4 \nmother or otherwise monitoring her care, several months went by before DFS discovered that \n5 \nDonna had been abducted.  Indeed, DFS first learned that Donna was no longer in Las Vegas \n6 \nwhen they were contacted by New Mexico authorities in December 2005.  \n7 \n  156.  Three days before her placement in the Romero’s home, a Clark County DFS \n8 \ncaseworker contacted them to ask if they would accept Donna.  Although Donna had been in \n9 \nfoster care before her abduction by her mother, DFS provided almost no information about \n10 \n11  Donna, other than her age, to the prospective foster parents.  They were told that Donna had \n12  no known behavioral problems or sexual abuse history.  \n13 \n  157.  Upon her return to foster care, Donna weighed approximately thirty pounds.  \n14 \nHer bones were sticking out; she appeared anorexic.  Her muscles were atrophied as a result \n15 \nof sitting in the car for days at a time. \n16 \n  158.  Despite her physical condition and the trauma she experienced, Clark County \n17 \nDFS failed to conduct a comprehensive health or mental health assessment of Donna when \n18 \nshe returned to foster care.  Donna’s caseworker told the foster parents a few days after Donna \n19 \nwas placed with them that she needed counseling, but made no arrangements for an \n20 \nassessment to gauge the severity of her physical and mental health problems.  The Romeros \n21 \n22  did not even receive a Medicaid card for Donna until several months after she was placed in \n23  their home.  \n24 \n  159.  Donna did not receive prompt, appropriate treatment to help her cope with the \n25 \nharm caused by months of living with her severely mentally ill mother.  She was placed on a \n26 \nwaiting list for several months.  Almost four months elapsed before she was seen by any \n27 \nmental health professional.  \n28 \n-42- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 43 of 73\n \n1    160.  While in the Romero home, Donna flourished and began to recover from the \n2  harms she had suffered while on the road with her mother.  When she came to the Romero \n3 \nhome, Donna did not know her ABCs, or numbers.  With the daily help of the foster mother, \n4 \nDonna made great strides. \n5 \n  161.  The Romero home is the type of foster home Clark County DFS should retain \n6 \nand try to replicate, if possible.  The Romeros possess the attributes foster families need to \n7 \nhelp children brought into foster care.  The Romeros are licensed as a flex family, meaning \n8 \nthey are dually licensed as an adoptive and foster home.  The Romeros wanted to adopt \n9 \nDonna, and conveyed this to DFS.  However, they were also prepared to provide her with a \n10 \n11  stable foster care home even if adoption was not the placement goal.   \n12    162.  On or about April 25, 2006, a hearing was scheduled in the Clark County \n13 \nDistrict Court to review Donna’s case and to determine, among other things, if a petition to \n14 \nterminate parental rights should be filed.  Prior to this hearing, Donna’s foster parent sent a \n15 \nletter to the juvenile court judge presiding over Donna’s case.  In her letter, Mrs. Romero \n16 \ndescribed Donna’s condition when she arrived at the foster home, their concerns for her safety \n17 \nand well-being, and the progress she had made since she came to live with them.  She \n18 \nexpressed her concerns about Donna’s safety if returned to her mother, based on Donna’s \n19 \nstatements and information that her mother herself had shared about her drug abuse history.  \n20 \nFinally, she asked the court to consider revising Donna’s visitation plan to ensure that her \n21 \n22  mother could not leave town with her again. \n23    163.  On May 4, 2006, Mrs. Romero was summoned to a meeting at Clark County \n24 \nDFS where for two hours she was confronted and criticized by five members of the DFS staff \n25 \nfor having written a letter to the juvenile court judge in Donna’s case.  Donna’s caseworker \n26 \nwas upset that she wrote the letter without asking DFS for permission.  The caseworker \n27 \n28 \n-43- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 44 of 73\n \n1  retaliated against them by beginning to plan for Donna’s removal from their home despite the \n2  fact that she was receiving exemplary care.  \n3 \n  164.  For Donna’s birthday, her foster parents were planning a party.  It would have \n4 \nbeen the first birthday party Donna had ever had.  They told the caseworker about the party, \n5 \nand asked that any placement changes of Donna be postponed until at least after her birthday \n6 \nparty.  The worker refused.  She removed Donna from the Romeros’ home ten days after the \n7 \nmeeting at DFS and just before her birthday.  \n8 \n  165.  Donna’s therapist advised the County DFS caseworker that removing Donna \n9 \nfrom the Romero home would be harmful and detrimental to Donna’s well-being.  During the \n10 \n11  almost six months Donna was living with the Romeros, she developed an attachment not only \n12  to the foster parents, but also to their seven- year-old daughter.  As a direct and foreseeable \n13 \nresult of the abrupt, unplanned, and wholly unjustified removal of Donna from the Romero \n14 \nhome, she suffered significant mental distress and emotional harm.     \n15 \nVII. \n16 \nCLARK COUNTY’S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS DESPERATELY  \n17  IN NEED OF REFORM \n \n18 \n  166.  Defendants have long known of the urgent need for systemic reform of \n19 \nNevada’s child welfare system.  Numerous reports have demonstrated that the system fails to \n20 \nprotect and actually affirmatively harms many of Nevada’s abused and neglected children.  \n21 \n22  The failures of Clark County’s child protection and foster care system have been open and \n23  notorious for years.  \n24 \n  167.  Between February 2004 and August 2006, local newspapers and television \n25 \nstations in Las Vegas reported on the child abuse or neglect deaths of more than twenty-four \n26 \nchildren in Clark County.  A substantial number of these children were in foster care with \n27 \nClark County DFS; had an open child protective services case with DFS at the time of their \n28 \n-44- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 45 of 73\n \n1  death; or had a history of involvement with child protective services and a case that had been \n2  closed by DFS despite strong indications that the child was at risk. \n3 \n  168.  In 2004, the Administration of Children and Families of the United States \n4 \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“Federal DHHS”) conducted a performance \n5 \nreview of Nevada’s child welfare system.  The review, referred to as a Child and Family \n6 \nService Review (“CFSR”), was designed to determine whether Nevada’s child welfare system \n7 \nsubstantially complies with the requirements of the “State’s Plan for Title IV-E of the Social \n8 \nSecurity Act Foster Care” and was meeting children’s needs for safety, well-being, and \n9 \npermanency.  All states are required to have a State Plan in order to access Title IV-E foster \n10 \n11  care funds.  During the CFSR review process, Federal DHHS identified numerous concerns \n12  related to Clark County’s child welfare system, as discussed below.   \n13 \n  169.  In October 2005, State DCFS conducted a review of a sample of child welfare \n14 \ncases from Clark County DFS.  The 2005 County Case Review assessed DFS performance in \n15 \nprotecting child abuse victims and foster children from harm, achieving permanent \n16 \nplacements for them, and promoting their physical and emotional well-being.  The children \n17 \nwhose cases were reviewed included children in foster care and children left in their home \n18 \nafter a report of suspected abuse/neglect.  The case review instrument used was adapted from \n19 \nthe tool used by federal reviewers who conducted the CFSR of the State’s child welfare \n20 \nprogram in 2004.  \n21 \n22    170.  In six of the seven outcome measures used to assess Clark County DFS’s \n23  protection and care of children, reviewers found that DFS failed to achieve a minimally \n24 \nacceptable level of performance.  More specifically, the 2005 County Case Review found that \n25 \nDFS failed to conduct appropriate assessments prior to removing children from their homes or \n26 \nreturning them to their homes; failed to conduct legally required visits with foster children; \n27 \n28 \n-45- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 46 of 73\n \n1  failed to address the educational needs of children in foster care; and failed to ensure that \n2  foster children received needed health care and mental health services. \n3 \n  171.  Many of the findings of the 2005 County Case Review were corroborated by a \n4 \nmore recent review of child abuse cases in Clark County.  In December 2005, after several \n5 \nmeetings with plaintiffs’ counsel, the Nevada DHHS began an analysis of Clark County’s \n6 \nalarming child fatality data.  Based on concerns relating to child welfare practices raised by \n7 \nthis preliminary analysis of fatality data, State DCFS contracted with the National Center for \n8 \nChild Death Review to conduct an in-depth study of 79 suspected child abuse/neglect deaths \n9 \nthat occurred between 2001 and 2004.  A panel of child welfare experts from outside Nevada \n10 \n11  was hired to manage the review process.   \n12    172.  The panel made numerous findings regarding systemic problems, including: \n13 \nfailure to respond to hotline calls promptly; failure to conduct appropriate safety assessments; \n14 \nand failure to substantiate reports of abuse and neglect that should have been substantiated.  \n15 \nThe panel also identified significant deficiencies relating to case practices, including; failure \n16 \nto make monthly visits with foster children; failure to provide children and families with \n17 \nneeded services; and failure to prepare service or safety plans for children and families.  In \n18 \naddition, the panel noted that there was inadequate training for caseworkers and that the \n19 \nsystem did not have adequate resources and staffing to meet children’s needs.   \n20 \n  173.  On August 11, 2006, Federal DHHS took the unusual step of informing the \n21 \n22  State of Nevada that it intended to renegotiate the State’s Program Improvement Plan due to \n23  worsening conditions for abused and neglected children in Clark County.  Federal DHHS’s \n24 \nrationale for taking this step included that there were “[s]erious deficiencies in the State’s \n25 \nchild welfare program, most specifically Clark County”; and that there was “[c]onsistent \n26 \novercrowding at Child Haven and recent tragedies involving children in foster care.”  Federal \n27 \nDHHS further stated that “the manner in which the continuum of child welfare services is \n28 \n-46- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 47 of 73\n \n1  managed in Clark County should be a grave concern to the State and should be addressed by \n2  the State in its administration and supervision of the program.” \n3 \nA.  Abused and neglected children in Clark County are placed in an unlicensed, \novercrowded, and unsafe facility for extended periods of time\n4 \n \n5 \n  174.  Defendants’ failure to recruit, train, support, and retain a sufficient number of \n6 \nfoster homes has resulted in over reliance on Child Have, a large, unlicensed congregate care \n7 \nfacility in Las Vegas.  Nearly all children who have been removed from the homes of their \n8 \nparents because of suspected abuse or neglect are first taken to Child Haven.  Children \n9 \nfrequently are forced to stay at Child Haven for long periods of time because there are no \n10 \n11  available beds at foster family shelter homes.    \n12    175.  Upon admission to Child Haven, children are stripped of their clothes and all \n13 \npersonal belongings.  Throughout their stay at Child Haven, children are not permitted to \n14 \nwear their own clothes - not even their own underwear - but are periodically issued clothes \n15 \nand shoes from a communal pile of clothing.  Oftentimes the clothes and shoes do not fit, and \n16 \nmay not even match the child’s gender.    \n17 \n  176.  Children placed at Child Haven are forced to live in overcrowded buildings \n18 \nwhere they sometimes sleep on the floor, are not provided with the health, educational or \n19 \ntherapeutic services they need, and often act out their justifiable rage at being treated \n20 \nneglectfully.  Their basic emotional needs are not met and they are not given even basic \n21 \n22  information about the plans the agency has for them.  \n23    177.  Child Haven is an unsafe place for children.  A growing number of children \n24 \nwith significant behavioral and emotional/mental health problems are placed at Child Haven.  \n25 \nYouth with a history of admissions to psychiatric hospitals, on psychotropic medication, and \n26 \nwith behaviors requiring the use of physical restraints by staff, present a frequent danger to \n27 \nother children and staff.  Older teens, some with a history of delinquent behavior, reside on \n28 \n-47- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 48 of 73\n \n1  the same campus, in close proximity to and sharing some common areas with toddlers and \n2  elementary school age children.  \n3 \n  178.  For years, Defendants have failed to address the problem of runaways from \n4 \nChild Haven.  Some youth are allowed to “walk away” from the facility when behaviors \n5 \nescalate to a point that staff determine that it is in the best interests of other children at Child \n6 \nHaven that they be allowed to run away.  While on runaway, these youth have engaged in \n7 \ndangerous, sometimes life-threatening behaviors.  During August 2006, a youth who had run \n8 \naway seven times from Child Haven was murdered on the streets of Las Vegas.  County DFS \n9 \nhas done little to address the chronic problem of runaways from Child Haven thus placing \n10 \n11  children and youth at substantial risk of harm.   \n12    179.  In 2004, federal reviewers found that “there is no monitoring or oversight \n13 \nprocess for Child Haven.”  This finding and the continued operation of Child Haven without a \n14 \nlicense, they concluded, was a violation of federal mandates that the state develop and \n15 \nimplement standards to ensure that children in foster care are provided with quality services \n16 \nthat protect the safety and health of children.  \n17 \n  180.  Following another site visit by federal officials to Child Haven in the summer \n18 \nof 2006, federal officials notified Defendants that “the situation (at Child Haven and within \n19 \nother parts of Clark County’s child welfare system) had worsened since the on-site visit” in \n20 \nFebruary 2004.  Federal officials concluded that “immediate and ongoing attention” was \n21 \n22  needed to ensure the safety, permanency, and well-being of children placed at Child Haven.    \n23    181.  During the last couple of years, a number of factors have compounded the \n24 \ninevitable risk and harm to children admitted to Child Haven.  The problems resulting from \n25 \nchronic, increasingly severe overcrowding are exacerbated by the admission of children and \n26 \nyouth with ever more serious and challenging behaviors, the agency practice of compelling \n27 \nstaff from other sections of the agency to work overtime at the buildings, the use of untrained \n28 \n-48- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 49 of 73\n \n1  volunteers, and the failure to provide children with the necessary assessments and therapeutic \n2  interventions to meet their needs.   \n3 \n  182.  Federal law forbids the use of federal funds for institutions caring for more \n4 \nthan twenty-five children.  As a result, Clark County does not receive any federal funds to \n5 \ndefray the $9 million per year that it costs to support the 6,000 children that pass through or \n6 \nreside at Child Haven in a year.  Despite this fact, federal officials notified Nevada that \n7 \n“[w]hile Child Haven placements are not eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement, the children \n8 \nplaced in this unlicensed congregate facility are the responsibility of the State of Nevada not \n9 \njust Clark County.”   \n10 \n11    183.  Current social science research provides substantial evidence that the care \n12  children and youth receive in group care and shelters like Child Haven is far more expensive \n13 \nand less beneficial than care provided in foster family homes.  As Richard Barth, the current \n14 \nDean of the School of Social Work at the University of Maryland wrote recently, “[c]ounties \n15 \nacross the United States have been closing child welfare shelters - at times, as a result of court \n16 \norders – but mostly because it is humane and cost effective…The money [spent to operate \n17 \nlarge shelters like Child Haven] could be more effectively spent in recruiting and providing \n18 \ntraining and support for foster caregivers.” \n19 \n20 \nB.  Child Haven has been chronically overcrowded for years\n21 \n  184.  Child Haven was designed to be a temporary shelter while children await \n22 \nplacement with their relatives or in a more family-like setting.  Child Haven’s campus \n23 \nconsists of eight buildings and an on-grounds school.  One building is used for visits between \n24 \nparents and children and/or administrative purposes; it is not used to house children.  Each of \n25 \nthe seven buildings used to house children has a capacity for 12 children except for the \n26 \ninfants’ building, which has a capacity for 20 infants.  Accordingly, Child Haven currently \n27 \n28  has a total capacity for 92 infants, children, and youth. \n-49- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 50 of 73\n \n1    185.  Despite its large size, Child Haven is chronically overcrowded, with many of \n2  the buildings housing more than twelve children.  Overcrowding has been tolerated for years.  \n3 \nFor all but a few months since January 2003, the number of children housed at Child Haven \n4 \nhas exceeded capacity.  The average daily population has been as high as 160 children or \n5 \nhigher, and has frequently been 146 or higher.     \n6 \n  186.  The overcrowding at Child Haven has worsened since October 2005, most \n7 \nrecently reaching more than 220 infants, children, and youth.  Overcrowding in the Agassi \n8 \nbuilding – reserved for a maximum of twenty newborns and infants – is endemic.  During the \n9 \nfirst week of April 2006, there were 56 infants in several buildings at Child Haven.  \n10 \n11    187.  In recent months the situation has become so dire that the staff lunch room was \n12  converted into an annex for infants.  Cribs are stacked one against the other in a room not \n13 \nintended or designed for the care of infants.  \n14 \n  188.  Overcrowding at Child Haven is not limited to the infant and toddler buildings.  \n15 \nOn December 9, during a “special evening inspection” of Child Haven by the Clark County \n16 \nHealth Department, the inspector noted overcrowding in the Bigelow building.  The Bigelow \n17 \nbuilding is for boys between the ages of five and ten.  Instead of the usual 18 children, on that \n18 \nevening there were 26 children being housed in the building.  Several children had no \n19 \nbedroom, and were forced to sleep on the floors of the common areas of the building.  These \n20 \nchildren slept on mats placed on the floor.  \n21 \n22    189.  Most recently, the federal government weighed in on the chronic overcrowding \n23  at Child Haven.  As of June 30, 2006, there were 205 children living at Child Haven, over half \n24 \nof whom were between the ages of 0-4.  Federal DHHS stressed the need to develop \n25 \nimmediate strategies to address this and other problems at Child Haven.   \n26 \nC.  Conditions at Child Haven endanger children and do not promote their well-\n27 \nbeing\n28   \n-50- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 51 of 73\n \n1    190.  Overcrowding at Child Haven has contributed to and exacerbated the \n2  frequency and severity of outbreaks of infectious and communicable diseases among the \n3 \nchildren placed there.  On August 1, 2005, the Clark County Health Department reported an \n4 \noutbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease.  A September 30, 2005 Health Department survey \n5 \nreported a concern of possible Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among \n6 \nchildren in Child Haven.  On that occasion, a two-year-old boy was found to have an MRSA \n7 \ninfection of the eye and a 10-month-old girl suffered an infection on her buttocks.  The boy \n8 \nwas taken to Sunrise Hospital for a culture to determine if the suspected infection was MRSA, \n9 \nbut was returned to the Child Haven building before the culture results were obtained thus \n10 \n11  exposing other children to the risk of infection.   \n12    191.  In addition to these health concerns, there are also no standards in place to \n13 \nensure that children’s health, mental health, and educational needs are met.  No individual \n14 \nassessments of children’s needs are conducted while they are placed at Child Haven, and as a \n15 \nresult, their treatment needs go unidentified and neglected and informed decision-making to \n16 \nselect the child’s next placement does not occur.   \n17 \n  192.  Clark County DFS considers Child Haven to be a temporary placement even \n18 \nthough many children stay for weeks, months, and years at a time.  Because of the purported \n19 \nshort-term nature of the placement, DFS does not arrange for or provide services for many of \n20 \nthe children in need of special treatment and services.  \n21 \n22    193.  Children who are discharged from Child Haven are not prepared for what is \n23  ahead.  A child is given little or no explanation of where they are being placed and who will \n24 \nbe their next caregiver.  They are given no opportunity to meet the caregiver before being \n25 \nabruptly transferred to the next placement.  They have no voice in the selection of the \n26 \nplacement.    \n27 \n28 \n-51- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 52 of 73\n \n1  D.  Placement of infants and toddlers at Child Haven is harmful, contrary to the \noverwhelming opinion of mental heath, child development and child welfare \n2  experts, and contrary to federal and state mandates \n \n3 \n4    194.  Infants entering foster care have very high rates of risk factors for \n5  psychopathology, medical illnesses, and developmental delays, and consequently have \n6 \nextensive service needs.  Sixty to eighty percent of young children entering care have at least \n7 \none medical illness and twenty-five percent have three or more chronic conditions.  As many \n8 \nas three-quarters of young children in placement need further developmental evaluation or \n9 \nhave a developmental delay.  \n10 \n  195.  Infants and toddlers, in particular, are most susceptible to long-term \n11 \ndetrimental effects as a result of placement, even for relatively short periods of time, in \n12 \ninstitutions.  The first three years of a child’s life are the most critical period for brain \n13 \n14  development, as this is the time when the brain is in an unparalleled time of developmental \n15  change.  \n16 \n  196.  Infants and toddlers need the presence of a primary caregiver to form an \n17 \nattachment to in order to develop normal emotional bonds and socialization skills.  Having \n18 \nalready suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect by a primary caregiver, they have an even \n19 \ngreater need for a stable, nurturing, individual caregiver.   \n20 \n  197.  Children in Child Haven end up interacting with a multiple shift-work staff.  \n21 \nAt Child Haven, infants and young children receive care from an ever-changing and large \n22 \nnumber of different caretakers, which is contrary to their well-being and harmful to their \n23 \ndevelopment.  There is no one person who provides consistent care for each infant.  It is \n24 \n25  estimated that in a week, an infant may have as many as twenty different caregivers.  Staff, \n26  though well-meaning, are simply unable to respond to each child’s individual cues and unable \n27 \nto attend to each child’s individual needs.  Shelter care institutions like Child Haven tend to \n28 \n-52- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 53 of 73\n \n1  be more concerned with the children’s physical care and establishment of routine, rather than \n2  the development of appropriate social interaction, language development, and autonomy. \n3 \n  198.  The placement of infants and toddlers in Child Haven is at odds with the \n4 \nmandate of federal law that children in foster care must be placed in the least restrictive, most \n5 \nfamily like setting consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child.  \n6 \n  199.  Placement of infants and toddlers in Child Haven runs counter to the \n7 \noverwhelming opinion of experts in the field of child welfare, infant mental health, and child \n8 \ndevelopment.  It is also against the overwhelming weight of current social science and infant \n9 \nmental health research.  That research confirms that children living in institutions like Child \n10 \n11  Haven tend to suffer from motor and language delays and display a lack of attachment and \n12  sense of trust, a restricted range of emotion expressions, and an absence of social play.  In \n13 \ncomparison to children placed in foster family homes, these children show poorer \n14 \ndevelopment and social emotional functioning.  \n15 \n  200.  Clark County DFS’s practice of placing infants at Child Haven also is \n16 \ninconsistent with its own determination, as stated in a 2004 Clark County Audit Department \n17 \nreport, that “based on research … infants and small toddlers under 3 years of age … have \n18 \nbeen shown to do better in a home with consistency in their caregivers versus those placed in \n19 \nan institution.”   \n20 \n21 \nE.  Children remain housed at Child Haven for months and sometimes years \n22   \n23    201.  Child Haven is intended to be a short-term placement for children taken into \n24  custody.  Clark County DFS policy specifies that children are not to be placed in the shelter \n25 \nfor longer than two weeks.  Despite this policy, many children, including infants and toddlers, \n26 \nremain in Child Haven for long periods of time. \n27 \n28 \n-53- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 54 of 73\n \n1    202.  In 2004, community stakeholders interviewed as part of the federal CFSR \n2  expressed concerns about the number of infants and very young children who are placed in \n3 \nChild Haven and who remain in the shelter for long periods of time. \n4 \n  203.  As of June 2006, the average length of stay was 45 days, with many children \n5 \nremaining at Child Haven for three to six months, and sometimes a year or longer.  According \n6 \nto Federal DHHS, one child had been living in Child Haven for over two years.   \n7 \n8  F.  Child Haven operates without the required license \n9 \n  204.  Although Nevada law requires all child care facilities operating in the state to \n10 \nobtain a license from the appropriate government agency before accepting children, Child \n11 \nHaven has operated for years without a license.  Child Haven, which is subject to licensure by \n12 \nthe City of Las Vegas Child Care Licensing Board, has also never complied with the licensing \n13 \nstandards established by state law. \n14 \n  205.  More than two years ago, as part of a federal CFSR, reviewers noted that Child \n15 \nHaven operated without the necessary license.  County and State Defendants were directed as \n16 \n17  part of their Program Improvement Plan to ensure that Child Haven met all applicable \n18  licensing requirements.  A deadline of January 31, 2006 was established for compliance with \n19 \nthis provision of the PIP.  Child Haven was not licensed as of January 31, 2006, and continues \n20 \nto operate in violation of the applicable licensing statutes, regulations, and standards   \n21 \nG.  Staffing and training at Child Haven are woefully inadequate\n22 \n \n23 \n  206.  Buildings at Child Haven are staffed by a combination of full-time employees, \n24 \npart-time staff, temporary employees, and volunteers.  Child Development Specialists staff \n25 \neach of the buildings working in three shifts around the clock. \n26 \n  207.  Direct care staff receives a mere two days of training in what the agency calls \n27 \nthe Child Haven Active Teaching Treatment Approach (CHATTA).  During what amounts to \n28 \n-54- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 55 of 73\n \n1  no more than twelve hours of actual training, staff receive half-hour segments on such \n2  subjects as principles of behavior, relationship building, youth rights, and working with the \n3 \nschool.  Furthermore, the CHATTA model has little or no empirical basis and its use with all \n4 \nage groups of children is inappropriate. \n5 \n  208.  The number and qualifications of staff at Child Haven are inadequate to ensure \n6 \nthe care, protection, and well-being of children at the facility.  Overcrowding at Child Haven \n7 \nhas led to requests and/or demands from the DFS director that other DFS staff not employed \n8 \nat Child Haven volunteer for duty at Child Haven.  County DFS caseworkers who are \n9 \nencouraged or coerced into volunteering to staff Child Haven are not trained in the care or \n10 \n11  supervision of the infants, children, and youth at the facility, thus placing those children at \n12  risk.   \n13 \nH.  Defendants’ failure to conduct proper child abuse and neglect investigations and \nmake reasonable efforts to keep children safely at home is harmful to children\n14 \n \n15 \n  209.  Multiple studies of casework practices in Clark County have indicated that \n16 \nDFS is failing to conduct adequate investigations of allegations of child abuse and neglect.   \n17 \n  210.  In the October 2005 County Case Review conducted by State DCFS, the \n18 \nreviewers found that children were removed from home without conducting a safety \n19 \nassessment to determine whether they could remain safely at home with provision of \n20 \nsupervision and services to the family.  The review also found that Clark County DFS failed \n21 \n22  to conduct ongoing safety and risk assessments to monitor children left in their homes.   \n23    211.  These findings were reinforced in the study conducted by the National Center \n24 \nfor Child Death Review.  The panel concluded that Clark County DFS has failed to \n25 \ninvestigate numerous child deaths despite evidence of substance abuse, prior substantiations, \n26 \nsignificant neglect, and lack of supervision; failed to perform timely safety assessments \n27 \nrelating to other children living in the home following a child death; and failed to substantiate \n28 \n-55- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 56 of 73\n \n1  numerous reports of abuse and neglect that should have been substantiated.  The panel also \n2  found that DFS failed to respond to hotline calls promptly, leaving some callers on hold for \n3 \nover 55 minutes and resulting in 27% dropped calls.   \n4 \n  212.  Based on the federal Program Improvement Plan review and a recent on-site \n5 \nvisit to Clark County, Federal DHHS again echoed findings in previous reports of severe \n6 \nproblems with CPS investigations in Clark County.  Federal DHHS concluded that Clark \n7 \nCounty does not have a 24 hour, seven day a week Child Protective Services Response team, \n8 \nwhich results in many children being unnecessarily removed by law enforcement and taken \n9 \ndirectly to Child Haven.  Children who are removed from their homes by law enforcement are \n10 \n11  not provided with a safety or family risk assessment.  Moreover, Federal DHHS noted that \n12  employees staffing the child abuse hotline have been deployed by the shelters to handle \n13 \nshelter intake, resulting in even longer waits and hotline calls going unanswered.   \n14 \n  213.  Child abuse investigations often are not completed within a reasonable time \n15 \nthus placing children who are the subject of such reports and their siblings at tremendous risk. \n16 \nIn recent months, there have been more than 340 investigations that are still pending and \n17 \nunresolved more than 45 days after the initial report of suspected abuse or neglect was \n18 \nreceived by Clark County DFS.    \n19 \n  214.  In addition to inadequate investigations, Clark County DFS has also failed to \n20 \nmake reasonable efforts to ensure that families receive services that would allow children to \n21 \n22  remain safely in their homes.  Federal DHHS has found that “there is an inadequate array of \n23  services to prevent placement by providing in-home family support services that are \n24 \nintegrated and facilitate the ability of children to remain in their own homes or return home in \n25 \na timely manner.”   \n26 \n  215.  Nevada’s Court Improvement Program workgroups have also identified the \n27 \noverall lack of services as a significant problem, and identified three areas in which services \n28 \n-56- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 57 of 73\n \n1  are particularly needed: substance abuse, mental health, and developmental delays.  Courts in \n2  Nevada have begun levying fines on State and county agencies for failing to provide children \n3 \nand families with needed court-ordered services.   \n4 \nI.  Defendants fail to place children in safe, appropriate, stable foster home \nplacements and supervise and support those placements\n5 \n \n6 \n  216.  Defendants’ over-reliance on Child Haven is fueled, in part, by their failure to \n7 \nrecruit an array of suitable foster homes to meet the needs of Nevada’s abused and neglected \n8 \nchildren.   \n9 \n  217.  Clark County DFS also fails to follow up on foster and adoptive parent \n10 \n11  inquiries from its own recruitment campaigns.  A recent recruitment campaign received 1,340 \n12  inquiries, but only resulted in 24 new foster homes.  Many inquiries from prospective foster \n13 \nparents were not pursued in a timely manner. \n14 \n  218.  Clark County DFS has failed to devote the staff and other resources necessary \n15 \nto recruit, train, and retain an adequate number of foster parents to meet the needs of children \n16 \nin foster care.  Clark County has only one full-time foster parent recruiter and one foster \n17 \nparent trainer.  Washoe County, with one-fourth the number of children in foster care, has \n18 \nthree full-time recruiters and three full-time trainers.  Clark County DFS continues to employ \n19 \nthe same recruitment strategies from year to year with the same poor results.  \n20 \n  219.  Due to the shortage of foster homes, children are often placed wherever an \n21 \n22  open bed exists, rather than in homes that meet their needs.  Little effort is made to assess \n23  children’s needs before placing them in a foster home or to match them with a foster parent \n24 \nwho has the appropriate skills or training.  To make matters worse, caseworkers often fail to \n25 \nprovide foster parents with information that is crucial to ensuring foster children’s safety, \n26 \nhealth, and well-being. \n27 \n28 \n-57- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 58 of 73\n \n1    220.  Some children have been placed with foster families that are taking care of \n2  more children than allowed by their license permits.  Clark County DFS frequently grants \n3 \nwaivers in order to place more children in the foster home than the foster parents’ license \n4 \npermits. \n5 \n  221.  Once children are placed in foster homes, they are often all but forgotten.  \n6 \nFoster parents are not provided adequate support or training, and are frequently left to fend for \n7 \nthemselves under challenging circumstances.  This lack of support results in failed foster \n8 \nplacements and increased instability for foster children.  Worsening the effects of the \n9 \ntraumatic experiences they encountered prior to entering foster care, foster children are re-\n10 \n11  traumatized by frequent placement disruptions.  \n12    222.  Caseworkers fail to make the requisite visits with children to ensure that their \n13 \nneeds are being met.  Clark County DFS’s own study found that in almost two-thirds of cases, \n14 \ncase workers failed to visit their clients as required by law.  Federal reviewers found that in \n15 \nmore than 40% of Clark County cases, the frequency of visits between caseworker and \n16 \nchildren was insufficient to ensure adequate monitoring of the child’s safety and well-being.  \n17 \n  223.  The federal performance review of Nevada’s child welfare system found that \n18 \nonly 31 percent of foster children in the Clark County had stable placements.  Many of the \n19 \nchildren experiencing multiple placements in Clark County were under five years of age.  \n20 \nFrequent changes in placement led to a lack of continuity in services, changes in schools, and \n21 \n22  an overall negative impact on children’s well-being.   \n23    224.  Federal reviewers found that chronic widespread disruptions in foster \n24 \nchildren’s placements are due to a lack of supports for foster families, failure to provide foster \n25 \nparents with sufficient information about a child prior to placement to ensure that the family is \n26 \nable to meet the child’s needs, insufficient mental health resources for children, and a lack of \n27 \n28 \n-58- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 59 of 73\n \n1  an array of placements to permit the matching of a child’s needs with the skills, knowledge, \n2  and abilities of the foster caregiver. \n3 \nJ.  Defendants fail to provide abused and neglected children with timely medical \ncare, mental health care, and educational services necessary to meet their needs\n4 \n \n5 \n  225.  Federal and State law require Defendants to provide foster children with \n6 \nmedical, dental, and mental health services to meet their needs.  Given the neglectful and \n7 \nchaotic environments foster youth often grow up in, it is crucial that they receive prompt \n8 \nassessments and medically necessary services.   \n9 \n  226.  Moreover, studies have shown that a high percentage of foster children have \n10 \n11  significant mental health problems.  Mental health experts agree that children with serious \n12  mental health problems require an array of individualized services tailored to address their \n13 \nneeds.  Such services should include professionally acceptable assessments, behavioral \n14 \nsupport and case management services, family support, crisis support, wraparound services, \n15 \ntherapeutic foster care and other mental health services, in a home-like setting.  \n16 \n  227.  Federal law requires states to cover certain mandatory services, including Early \n17 \nand Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (“EPSDT”) services, for Medicaid-eligible \n18 \nchildren under the age of 21.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(4)(B).  \n19 \nUnder EPSDT, states are required to provide screening services to identify defects, \n20 \nconditions, and illness.  States must provide the necessary services to correct or ameliorate \n21 \n22  those conditions or illness.   \n23    228.  Despite these requirements, foster children are often deprived of needed health \n24 \nand mental health care.  The 2005 County Case Review found that Clark County DFS fails \n25 \neven to assess the mental health and health needs of 50% of the children in care.  For those \n26 \nchildren who do receive some sort of assessment, DFS fails to ensure that physical and mental \n27 \nhealth services are being provided. \n28 \n-59- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 60 of 73\n \n1    229.  The 2006 Child Fatality Report also found that DFS fails to provide children \n2  and families with services needed to resolve identified issues.  DFS fails to complete service \n3 \nplans for children or to document or follow-up on referrals for services.  \n4 \n  230.  Moreover, DFS does not ensure that children with mental health needs receive \n5 \nan individualized treatment that addresses their needs.  There is a severe lack of mental health \n6 \nservices such as behavioral support, psychiatric and other clinical services, case management \n7 \nservices, therapeutic foster care services provided in a home-like setting, and wraparound \n8 \nservices.  \n9 \n  231.  Nevada law also requires foster placements to ensure that foster children attend \n10 \n11  school full-time; are provided with appropriate educational assessments and services; receive \n12  an appropriate education, including special education services or training programs, as \n13 \nneeded; and are afforded an opportunity to complete schooling or training in accordance with \n14 \ntheir aptitude.  \n15 \n  232.  Despite these requirements, the Federal DHHS has found that foster children’s \n16 \neducational needs were being woefully neglected.  DFS fails to obtain copies of school \n17 \nrecords for children in foster care; fails to obtain copies of the Individualized Education Plan \n18 \n(IEP) for children receiving special education services and to provide such information to \n19 \nfoster parents; and fails to advocate for children’s educational needs in the school system.  \n20 \nK.  Caseworkers’ high caseloads, inadequate training, and poor supervision threaten \n21 \nthe safety and well-being of Nevada’s abused and neglected children\n22   \n23    233.  A well-trained, experienced, and adequately staffed workforce is a vital \n24 \ncomponent of any child welfare system.  When caseworkers are overwhelmed, untrained, and \n25 \npoorly supervised, the child welfare system inevitably breaks down, resulting in reasonably \n26 \nforeseeable harm to foster children.  Unfortunately, Clark County’s system is lacking in each \n27 \nof these important workforce areas. \n28 \n-60- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 61 of 73\n \n1    234.  High caseloads are prevalent among Clark County DFS caseworkers and are \n2  among the highest in the state.  In February 2005, the average caseload for DFS caseworkers \n3 \nwas 1:35. \n4 \n  235.  DFS staff caseloads are significantly higher than the caseload ratio required for \n5 \naccreditation by the Council on Accreditation, which is no greater than 1:18.  They also far \n6 \nexceed the caseload ratios established by Child Welfare League of America Standards, which \n7 \nare between 1:12 and 1:15.  \n8 \n  236.  As a direct result of the high caseloads of workers within Clark County DFS, \n9 \ninvestigations of reports of abuse are not initiated promptly nor completed within 30 days, \n10 \n11  investigations fail to comply with minimum standards required of such investigations, \n12  monthly visits to foster homes are not conducted, and children are harmed or at grave risk of \n13 \nharm. \n14 \n  237.  Caseworkers receive only minimal training prior to working with children and \n15 \nfamilies.  As a result, they are ill-prepared to perform the duties and responsibilities assigned \n16 \nto them and fail to exercise professional judgment when making life and death decisions for \n17 \nchildren.   \n18 \n  238.  During the 2004 federal CFSR, federal reviewers found that many caseworkers \n19 \ndo not complete required ongoing in-service training.  Although Washoe County and the rural \n20 \nareas of the state require that workers must be licensed, Clark County does not.  Even staff \n21 \n22  assigned to investigate abuse reports are not licensed.   \n23    239.  The Child Fatality Study found that DFS fails to make monthly contact with \n24 \nchildren and family who have open cases and follow-up appropriately; fails to resolve \n25 \nproblems or concerns prior to closing cases; fails to complete service or safety plans for \n26 \nchildren and families; and fails to provide case workers with appropriate training. \n27 \n28 \n-61- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 62 of 73\n \n1    240.  The 2006 Child Fatality Report found that County DFS caseworkers \n2  consistently fail to document critical information.  Case files lacked documentation of \n3 \ninvestigative contacts, family background checks, progress toward case goals, the basis for \n4 \nsafety decisions, the nature and purpose of service referrals, and contact with service \n5 \nproviders to ascertain progress.  The study found that such poor documentation practices \n6 \nserve as a major barrier to future quality assurance efforts, and could represent a critical \n7 \nweakness in the overall safety net. \n8 \nL.  Defendants fail to ensure that abused and neglected children have a voice in \n9 \ncourt proceedings\n \n10 \n11 \n  241.  Approximately half of all children and youth who are the subject of abuse and \n12 \nneglect proceedings in Clark County are unrepresented by a guardian ad litem in those \n13 \nproceedings. \n14 \n  242.  Children who are the subject of abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark County \n15 \nare, if provided with any representation at all, represented either by the Children’s Advocacy \n16 \nProject (CAP) of Clark County Legal Services or Las Vegas Court Appointed Special \n17 \nAdvocates (CASA).  On occasion a child may have both an attorney and CASA.  \n18 \n19    243.  CAP employs six attorneys, each of whom represents 40 to 50 children.  \n20  Consequently, on average, no more than 300 out of the 3,000 children in foster care in Clark \n21  County are represented by an attorney.  Upon information and belief, CAP attorneys do not \n22 \nact as guardians ad litem for the children or youth they are appointed to represent.   \n23 \n  244.  There are about 200 CASAs in Clark County.  In 2005, they represented 480 \n24 \nchildren, and they reported that they had to turn away 89 children who were referred by the \n25 \ncourt.   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-62- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 63 of 73\n \n1    245.  Neither CAP nor CASA represent children at the earliest stages of the \n2  proceedings, including proceedings to determine if children should be taken into or remain in \n3 \ninitial protective custody.  \n4 \n  246.  The lack of representation for child abuse and neglect victims in Clark County \n5 \nDistrict Court proceedings has been known to Defendants and tolerated for years. \n6 \n  247.  In January 2006, Chief Justice Rose of the Nevada Supreme Court \n7 \nacknowledged that “[w]e need more attorneys and CASA volunteers to assist children.” \n8 \n  248.  Clark County Family Court Judge Gerald Hardcastle has admitted that over \n9 \nhalf of all children and youth who are the subject of abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark \n10 \n11  County District Court are unrepresented in the proceedings. \n12    249.  During the entire time that children and youth have gone unrepresented in \n13 \nchild abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark County District Court, State DCFS has received \n14 \nand continues to receive funds under the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.  \n15 \n  250.  The failure to provide children and youth with representation in the juvenile \n16 \ncourt leads to ill-informed decisions and inhibits the court’s obligation to oversee the child’s \n17 \nplacement, care, and treatment while in foster care.   \n18 \nVIII. \n19 \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION– \n20 \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\n21 \n \n22 \n  251.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n23 \n  252.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants in their official capacities \n24 \nconstitute a failure to meet the affirmative duty to protect from harm all plaintiffs, which is a \n25 \nsubstantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the violation of the constitutionally \n26 \n27  protected liberty and privacy interests of all plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n28  1983.   \n-63- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 64 of 73\n \n1    253.  The foregoing actions and inaction of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \n2  practice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of reasonable professional \n3 \njudgment in violation of the constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests \n4 \nof all plaintiffs.  As a result, all plaintiffs have been and are being deprived of the substantive \n5 \ndue process rights conferred upon them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n6 \nConstitution.   \n7 \n  254.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right to \n8 \nprotection from unnecessary harm while in government custody; the right to a living \n9 \nenvironment that protects foster children’s physical, mental, and emotional safety and well-\n10 \n11  being; the right to services necessary to prevent foster children from deteriorating or being \n12  harmed physically, developmentally, psychologically, or otherwise while in government \n13 \ncustody, including but not limited to the right to safe and secure foster care placements, \n14 \nappropriate monitoring and supervision, appropriate planning and services directed toward \n15 \nensuing that the child can leave foster care and grow up in a permanent family, adequate \n16 \nmental, dental, psychiatric, psychological, and educational services; the right to treatment and \n17 \ncare consistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by Defendants; the right not to \n18 \nbe retained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes to be served by \n19 \ntaking the child into custody; the right to be placed in the least restrictive placement based on \n20 \nthe foster child’s needs; and the right to receive care, treatment, and services determined and \n21 \n22  provided through the exercise of accepted, reasonable professional judgment.   \n23  IX. \n24 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION– \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION:  \n25 \nSTATE CREATED DANGER CLAIM (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983)  \n \n26 \n27    255.

The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants amount to a pattern, \n2  practice, and custom of failure to exercise reasonable professional judgment in violation of \n3 \nthe constitutional rights of all plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n4 \nDefendants are engaging in a pattern and practice of violating plaintiffs’ rights under the Due \n5 \nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution, by removing plaintiffs from their caretakers \n6 \nand placing them in placements that Defendants know or should know pose an imminent risk \n7 \nof harm to these children, in disregard for the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. \n8 \nX. \n9 \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION– \n10 \nPROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO \n11  THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § \n1983) \n12   \n13 \n  257.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n14 \n  258.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants in their official capacities, \n15 \nconstitutes a failure to exercise an affirmative duty to protect the welfare of all plaintiffs, \n16 \nwhich is a substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the violation of the \n17 \nconstitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to \n18 \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n19 \n  259  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \n20 \npractice and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of reasonable professional \n21 \n22  judgment and violates the constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of \n23  all plaintiffs.  As a result, all plaintiffs are being deprived of federally created and state-\n24 \ncreated liberty or property rights without due process of law.  The federal law entitlements to \n25 \nwhich children have a constitutionally protected interest arise from the Child Abuse \n26 \nPrevention and Treatment Act as codified at 42 U.S.C. §55101 et seq., and the Adoption \n27 \n28 \n-65- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 66 of 73\n \n1  Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families \n2  Act of 1997, as codified at 42 U.S.C. §670 et seq. \n3 \nXI. \n4 \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION– \nFEDERAL ADOPTION ASSISTANCE ACT (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § \n5 \n1983) \n6   \n7    260.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n8 \n  261.  The foregoing actions and omissions of Defendants in their official capacities, \n9 \namount to a policy, pattern, and/or practice of depriving all plaintiffs of rights conferred on \n10 \nthem by the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \n11 \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (collectively the “Adoption Assistance Act”) and the \n12 \nregulations promulgated under the Act, 45 C.F.R.

Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 432B.500 and 432B.505, requiring that plaintiffs be appointed \n11 \na guardian ad litem who must appear at all proceedings before the court and perform specific \n12 \nduties, including representing and protecting the best interests of the child;  \n13 \nb.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.260, requiring Clark County DFS to initiate child welfare \n14 \ninvestigations promptly upon receipt of a report of possible abuse or neglect of a child;  \n15 \n16  c.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. §§ 424.160 and 424.805, requiring Clark County DFS to \n17  ensure that the number of children placed in a particular foster home does not exceed \n18  established levels; to respond in a timely manner to foster parents’ requests for assistance in \n19 \nmeeting their foster child’s needs; to assist foster parents in developing their capabilities to \n20 \nmeet their foster child’s needs; and to provide a program of respite care to foster parents; \n21 \nd.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.405 and Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 424.565, requiring \n22 \nClark County DFS to ensure that foster children receive necessary care and services for their \n23 \nmental and emotional health, and receive visits no less than once a month from a caseworker; \n24 \ne.  Nev. Admin. Code. Ann. §§ 432B.185 and 432B.405, requiring Clark County DFS to \n25 \nassess plaintiffs’ safety before returning them to the custody of their parents, using input from \n26 \n27  persons directly involved with the case; and    \n28 \n-71- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 72 of 73\n \n1  f.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432A.131 and Las Vegas Mun. Code § 6.24.050, requiring that \n2  child care facilities must be licensed prior to placement of plaintiffs in such facilities; \n3 \ng.  Nev. Admin. Code Ann. § 432B.340, requiring residential institutions to provide the \n4 \nresources needed to prevent foreseeable harm to children; and  \n5 \nh.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 127.330, requiring defendants to follow established procedures \n6 \nand criteria when placing plaintiffs with a person who resides outside of the state. \n7 \n  274.  As evidenced by their failure to comply with these laws, Defendants have \n8 \nbreached their legal duties to plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs belong to the class of persons that the \n9 \nprovisions were intended to protect, and the injuries plaintiffs suffered are of the type the \n10 \n11  provisions were intended to prevent.  Defendants’ negligence has caused damage to plaintiffs.  \n12  XVII. \n13 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n14 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n15 \na)  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \n16 \nb)  Order that plaintiffs may maintain this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) \n17 \nand 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \n18 \nc)  Declare unconstitutional and unlawful pursuant to Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of \n19 \nCivil Procedure Defendants’ violations of plaintiffs’ rights. \n20 \nd)  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting plaintiffs to \n21 \n22  practices that violate their rights. \n23  e)  Order appropriate remedial relief to ensure Defendants’ future compliance with their \n24 \nlegal obligations to plaintiffs and retain jurisdiction of this matter to ensure full, adequate, and \n25 \neffective implementation of the relief ordered by this Court; \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-72- \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 1   Filed 08/30/06   Page 73 of 73\n \n1  f)  Award to the plaintiffs the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution \n2  of this action, including but not limited to reasonable fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ \n3 \n1988 and 1920 and Fed.

Hawkins’ (collectively “State Defendants”) Motion to Dismiss, or in\n15\nthe Alternative, Motion for More Definite Statement (#48), Defendant Kenny Guinn’s\n16\nMotion to Dismiss (#49), Motion for Clarification and Enlargement of Time (#65), and\n17\nMotion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (#95), Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify\n18\nClass (#74), and Defendants Clark County Division of Family Services, Virginia Valentine,\n19\nTom Morton, Louis Palma, Bruce L.

(#104.)  After considering the Motions, the pleadings on file, and\n23\noral argument on behalf of all parties, the Court issues the following Order. \n24\n25\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 2 of 48(cid:10)\n1 BACKGROUND\n2 In August 2006, Plaintiffs1 filed suit on behalf of themselves and “all abused and\n3 neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care system.” \n4 (#57-1 at 6.)  Plaintiffs bring this civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Kenny C.\n5 Guinn,2 as Nevada Governor, Michael Wilden (Director of Nevada Health and Human\n6 Services), Fernando Serrano (Administrator of the Nevada Division of Child and Family\n7 Services), John Doe (Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Services for Child Care of the Division\n8 of Child and Family Services), Virginia Valentine (Clark County Manager), Clark County\n9 Department of Family Services, Tom Morton (Director of Clark County Department of\n10 Family Services), Louis Palma (Manager of Shelter Care for the Clark County Department of\n11 Family Services), County Commissioners Bruce L. Woodbury, Tom Collins, Chip Maxfield,\n12 Yvonne Atkinson Gates, Myrna Williams, Lynette Boggs McDonald, and Rory Reid, and\n13 finally Clark County itself.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the\n14 operation of Nevada’s and Clark County’s foster care system.  \n15 In their Complaint, Plaintiffs generally allege that Defendants violated the United\n16 States Constitution, federal statutes, federal common law, and the Nevada Constitution by\n17 failing to protect both the individual Plaintiffs and the purported class.  Plaintiffs attribute\n18 this alleged systemic failure to poor management and gross over-burdening of the foster care\n19 system in Clark County.  Moreover, Plaintiffs generally allege that Defendants have failed to\n20 1Plaintiffs proceed under fictitious names pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a).  The named Plaintiffs\ninclude Clark K. (by his next friend Sherry Anderson), Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. (collectively the “A\n21 Plaintiffs”) (by their next friend Tarrah Logan), Toni Summer and Frank B. (collectively the “B Plaintiffs”) (by their\nnext friend Marilyn Paikai), and Donna C. (by her next friend Jacquelyn Romero).\n22\n2\nGovernor Guinn is no longer Nevada Governor.  This fact does not dismiss the Governor’s office from this action. \nWhen a public officer who is sued in the officer’s official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office,\n23\nthe action does not abate and the successor is automatically substituted as Defendant.  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21,\n25 (1991).  Accordingly, in this Order the Court substitutes current Nevada Governor Gibbons’s name for Governor\n24\nGuinn.  \n25 Page 2 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 3 of 48(cid:10)\n1 provide effective leadership or the resources and support necessary to ensure that the foster\n2 care system provides adequate protection and services to Nevada’s most vulnerable children. \n3 Finally, Plaintiffs assert that while Defendants have been aware of the alleged wrongs, as\n4 documented in a federal report submitted to then Governor Guinn, they have failed to take\n5 any remedial action.  More specifically, Plaintiffs allege horrible circumstances in the Clark\n6 County foster care system.  For example, in their Complaint, Plaintiffs highlight instances in\n7 which Plaintiffs were sexually, physically, and psychologically abused, and in at least one\n8 instance killed (one of Plaintiffs’ siblings) while in foster care custody.  Moreover, the\n9 Complaint states that Plaintiffs have not received medical treatment while in foster custody.\n10 Plaintiffs allege ten causes of action: (1) substantive due process violations under the\n11 United States Constitution; (2) substantive due process—state created danger; (3) procedural\n12 due process violations under the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) violations of the Federal\n13 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act; (5) violations of the Child Abuse Prevention\n14 and Treatment Act; (6) violations of the health screening and follow up provisions in the\n15 Medicaid Act; (7) procedural due process violations under the Nevada Constitution; (8)\n16 substantive due process violations under the Nevada Constitution; (9) negligence; and (10)\n17 breach of state plans under the Social Security Act.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory\n18 relief to halt the alleged violations and to ensure Defendants protect and provide the\n19 necessary care to foster children in Clark County.  \n20 DISCUSSION\n21 Defendant Gibbons, County Defendants, and State Defendants have filed separate\n22 Motions to Dismiss based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Defendants further\n23 ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of justiciability.  The Court discusses each\n24 Motion below.\n25 Page 3 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 4 of 48(cid:10)\n1 I. Justiciability\n2 Initially, the Court must resolve threshold questions regarding whether Plaintiffs’\n3 claims present a justiciable case or controversy.  Specifically, the Court must decide whether\n4 any of Plaintiffs’ claims are moot and whether Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the\n5 allegedly illegal practices at issue before the Court.  Both Governor Gibbons and the County\n6 Defendants challenge Plaintiffs’ standing in this case.  \n7 B. Mootness \n8 “[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a\n9 legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496\n10 (1969).  “Put another way, [a] case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with\n11 respect to which the court can give meaningful relief.”  Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v.\n12 Fla. Dep’t of Health & Rehabilitative Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1217 (11th Cir. 2000) (citations\n13 and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n14 Plaintiffs seek relief for all children that have ever entered into the Clark County\n15 foster care system, even if they do not currently reside in foster care.  County Defendants\n16 argue the Court must dismiss all claims for Plaintiffs no longer in foster care because they are\n17 no longer in the Defendants’ legal or physical custody, and they therefore cannot be further\n18 harmed by Defendants’ alleged illegal practices.  Some courts have held that no live case or\n19 controversy exists between Defendants and children not in foster care.  See, e.g., 31 Foster\n20 Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir. 2003).  However, Defendants have not\n21 demonstrated that any of the named Plaintiffs are not currently in, or will not imminently\n22 return to, foster custody.  Defendants also argue that the Court must dismiss as moot all\n23 claims for any proposed class members not currently in foster care.  As discussed below, the\n24\n25 Page 4 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 5 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Court defers ruling on class certification.  Accordingly, the Court defers ruling on\n2 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss based on mootness.  \n3 B. Standing\n4 Under Article III, federal courts cannot entertain a litigant’s claims unless that party\n5 demonstrates concrete injury, satisfying the burden to demonstrate both constitutional and\n6 prudential standing to sue.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Both\n7 Governor Gibbons and County Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their\n8 claims.\n9 1. Article III Standing \n10 Plaintiffs must demonstrate three elements to constitute the “irreducible constitutional\n11 minimum” of Article III standing.  Id. at 561.  First, Plaintiffs must have suffered an “injury-\n12 in-fact” to a legally protected interest.  Id. at 560.  The injury must be both “concrete and\n13 particularized” and “actual or imminent,” as opposed to “conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. at\n14 560 (citation omitted).  Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the\n15 conduct complained of—the injury must be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of\n16 the defendant . . . .” Id.  Third, it must be likely that the injury will be “redressed by a\n17 favorable decision.”  Id. at 561 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n18 Plaintiffs bear the burden to establish standing.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162\n19 (1997).  The requisite evidence necessary to satisfy this burden depends on the stage of\n20 litigation at which the standing challenge is made.  Id.  The Supreme Court has held that\n21 where a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss is based on lack of standing, the reviewing court must\n22 defer to the plaintiff’s factual allegations and “must presume that general allegations embrace\n23 those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.”  Id.; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n24 Thus, the Court may only dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing if Plaintiffs have\n25 Page 5 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 6 of 48(cid:10)\n1 failed to make “general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct.” \n2 Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \n3 In order to satisfy the “injury-in-fact” requirement, a plaintiff need not wait for an\n4 injury to occur.  An allegation of future injury satisfies this prong so long as the alleged injury\n5 is “imminent” or “real and immediate” and not merely “conjectural” or “hypothetical.”  Id. at\n6 560; Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02 (1983).  When a plaintiff cannot show that an\n7 injury is likely to occur immediately, the plaintiff does not have standing to seek prospective\n8 relief even if he has suffered a past injury.  For example, in Lyons, the plaintiff sought to\n9 enjoin the use of “chokeholds” by police officers.  461 U.S. at 98.  The Court stated that the\n10 plaintiff’s standing to seek that relief hinged on “whether he was likely to suffer future injury\n11 from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”  Id. at 105.  The Court held that the\n12 plaintiff lacked standing because the probability of future injury was too speculative,\n13 explaining:\n14 In order to establish an actual controversy in this case, [the plaintiff] would\nhave had not only to allege that he would have another encounter with the\n15 police but also to make the incredible assertion either (1) that all police\nofficers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen to\n16 have an encounter . . . or (2) that the City ordered or authorized police officers\nto act in such manner.\n17\nId. at 105-06.  As Lyons illustrates, future injury that depends on either the random or\n18\nunauthorized acts of a third party is too speculative to satisfy standing requirements. \n19\nHowever, when the threatened acts that may cause injury are authorized or part of a policy, it\n20\nis significantly more likely that the injury will occur again.  See id. at 106 (stating that the\n21\nplaintiff may have had standing if he had alleged “that the City ordered or authorized police\n22\nofficers to [perform illegal chokeholds]”).\n23\n24\n25 Page 6 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 7 of 48(cid:10)\n1 This case is different than Lyons.  Plaintiffs in this case who are in foster care have\n2 standing to pursue their claims.  They are in the Defendants’ custody and will be so until they\n3 are returned to their parents, are adopted, or reach the age of majority.  They cannot avoid\n4 exposure to Defendants’ challenged conduct.  The alleged systemic deficiencies in the Clark\n5 County and Nevada foster care system are similar to an injurious policy and different from\n6 the random act at issue in Lyons. The alleged pattern and practice in this case presents a\n7 substantial likelihood that the alleged injury will occur.  \n8 Moreover, Plaintiffs’ allegations support the conclusion that future injury will proceed\n9 with a high degree of immediacy.  The Supreme Court addressed this aspect of the injury-in-\n10 fact requirement in Lujan, holding that because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate their\n11 injury would “proceed with a high degree of immediacy, so as to reduce the possibility of\n12 deciding a case in which no injury would have occurred at all,” they lacked standing to\n13 pursue their claim.  504 U.S. at 559, 564 n.2.  Thus, under Lujan, one cannot merely allege\n14 that an injury will be suffered at “some time” in the future.  However, a plaintiff need not\n15 demonstrate that the injury will occur within days or even weeks to have standing.  See, e.g.,\n16 Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211-12 (1995) (stating that a plaintiff who\n17 was likely to suffer injury within a one year period had standing to sue).\n18 In the present case, the Plaintiffs assert detailed allegations of tangible injuries. \n19 Plaintiffs also allege these harms will continue into the present and are very likely to persist\n20 into the future unless Defendants are forced to remedy the significant problems in Clark\n21 County’s child welfare system.  Plaintiffs assert substantive harms based on alleged\n22 violations of federal and state constitutional rights, federal and state common law, and state\n23 and federal statutory rights.  Throughout their Complaint, Plaintiffs generally describe the\n24 injuries they claim to have suffered due to Defendants’ allegedly illegal conduct.  At the\n25 Page 7 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 8 of 48(cid:10)\n1 pleading stage in litigation and for standing purposes, the Court assumes the allegations in\n2 the Complaint are true and may only dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing if\n3 Plaintiffs have failed to make “general factual allegations of injury resulting from the\n4 defendant’s conduct.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n5 In addition to injury-in-fact, Plaintiffs must also allege that their injuries are “fairly\n6 traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent\n7 action of some third party not before the court,” and that it is likely the injury will be\n8 redressed if the court rules in their favor.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997). \n9 According to the Complaint, Defendants’ failures caused Plaintiffs’ injuries and their\n10 continued failures are likely to cause further injuries.  Therefore, for purposes of standing at\n11 the pleading stage, the alleged injuries suffered by Plaintiffs are fairly traceable to\n12 Defendants’ conduct.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  In addition, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory\n13 judgment and prospective injunctive relief that will prevent Defendants from violating their\n14 constitutional and federal statutory rights.  The relief Plaintiffs seek would clearly remedy\n15 their claimed injuries.  Moreover, as discussed further below, federal courts have generally\n16 afforded foster children standing in situations like this case.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have\n17 sufficiently alleged constitutional standing as required by the Supreme Court at the pleading\n18 stage of litigation.  \n19 2. Prudential Standing \n20 Prudential requirements for standing include (1) whether Plaintiff’s alleged injury\n21 falls within the “zone of interests” protected by the statute or constitutional provision at issue,\n22 (2) whether the Complaint amounts to generalized grievances that are more appropriately\n23 resolved by the legislative and executive branches, and (3) whether Plaintiffs assert their own\n24\n25 Page 8 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 9 of 48(cid:10)\n1 legal rights and interests, rather than those of third parties.  Desert Citizens Against Pollution\n2 v. Bisson, 231 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2000).\n3 Both County Defendants and the Governor argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential\n4 standing because (1) the Court should decline to intervene in the realm of domestic relations,\n5 which “belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States,”  Elk Grove\n6 Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004), and (2) those who act as Plaintiffs’\n7 “next friend” in this lawsuit are improper parties.  \n8 First, citing Newdow, Defendants claim this case is nothing more than a domestic\n9 relations issue, and thus the Court should find that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing. \n10 However, this case is distinguishable from Newdow and the other cases to which Defendants\n11 cite.  In Newdow the court held that a father lacked prudential standing to bring an action\n12 challenging the constitutionality of a school district policy requiring his daughter to recite the\n13 Pledge of Allegiance.  Id. at 14-15.  The Court reasoned that domestic relations barred federal\n14 court adjudication of the federal questions in that case because “Newdow’s standing\n15 derive[d] entirely from his relationship with his daughter,” and his “parental status [was]\n16 defined by California’s domestic relations law.”  Id. at 15.  According to Newdow, “it is\n17 improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is\n18 founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an\n19 adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiff’s claimed standing.”  Id. at 17.  \n20 In Newdow, the father filed a suit on his own behalf, but his standing depended on\n21 “family law rights that [were] in dispute”—specifically, the interpretation of a state court\n22 custody order.  Determining his standing led the Court into a complex custody dispute\n23 between Mr. Newdow and his ex-wife, leading the Court to “stay its hand.”  Here, in stark\n24 contrast to Newdow, Plaintiffs have filed suit on their own behalf.\n25 Page 9 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 10 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because the alleged violations are\n2 more appropriately addressed by the legislative process.  However, as discussed below, many\n3 courts have held that some of the provisions under which Plaintiffs filed suit create a private\n4 cause of action; hence, Plaintiffs have standing as to those claims.\n5 Finally, Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing because those who are acting as\n6 their “next friends” in this case are improper parties.  A next friend must satisfy three criteria:\n7 (1) the next friend must provide an adequate explanation as to why the real parties in interest\n8 cannot bring the suit themselves; (2) the next friend must be dedicated to minors’ best\n9 interests; and (3) the next friend must have some significant relationship with the minors. \n10 Whitmore v. Ark., 495 U.S. 149, 163-64 (1989).  Plaintiffs satisfy all three prongs in this case. \n11 First, Plaintiffs note they are minors in foster custody challenging governmental\n12 action.  Plaintiffs argue that using their true identities would compel Plaintiffs to reveal\n13 highly intimate information.  Some Plaintiffs have been subjected to horrid experiences,\n14 including abuse.  Certainly the Court should honor their request to keep their identities\n15 unknown.  \n16 Second, the next friends are all either family members or former foster parents. \n17 Plaintiff Clark K.’s next friend is his paternal grandmother, who has expressed a desire to act\n18 within Clark K.’s best interests.  The A Plaintiffs’ next friend is their paternal aunt.  The A\n19 Children have lived with their aunt and have expressed that she acts in their interests.  The B\n20 Plaintiffs’ next friend is a former foster parent.  These individuals have expressed an intent to\n21 act in the children’s best interest and have demonstrated they have a significant relationship\n22 with the minors.  Accordingly, they meet the three criteria set out by the Supreme Court.  See\n23 id.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have prudential standing to file this action.\n24\n25 Page 10 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 11 of 48(cid:10)\n1 3. Children Not Currently in Foster Custody\n2 Plaintiffs also argue that children in the proposed class who are not currently in\n3 custody, but that have been or could be subject to the foster care system, also have standing. \n4 Defendants argue, however, that any Plaintiffs who are not in the foster care custody lack\n5 standing to pursue the constitutional claims in this action.  See 31 Foster Children v. Bush,\n6 329 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir. 2003).  As discussed below, the Court defers ruling on\n7 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification until the parties have an opportunity to conduct\n8 additional discovery regarding the proposed class.  Thus, the Court does not rule at this time\n9 whether any proposed class members not currently in custody lack prudential standing.  \n10 II. County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\n11 In addition to challenging standing, County Defendants ask the Court to dismiss\n12 Plaintiffs’ Complaint because Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.  Specifically, County\n13 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state valid claims against the Department of\n14 Family Services (“DFS”) because DFS lacks capacity to be sued.  County Defendants further\n15 contend that the Court should dismiss all claims against Clark County Commissioners and\n16 that Plaintiffs have not asserted valid federal claims.  County Defendants also argue they are\n17 immune from liability and that the Court should abstain from hearing this case.\n18 A. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard\n19 Under Rule 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a claim if the plaintiffs “fail to state a claim\n20 upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Dismissal for failure to state a\n21 claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper only if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n22 the claim that would entitle her to relief.  Williamson v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 208 F.3d\n23 1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 2000).  The review is limited to the complaint, and all allegations of\n24 material fact are taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  In re\n25 Page 11 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 12 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Stac Elecs. Sec. Litig., 89 F.3d 1399, 1403 (9th Cir. 1996).  Although courts assume the\n2 factual allegations to be true, courts should not “assume the truth of legal conclusions merely\n3 because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.”  W. Mining Council v. Watt, 643\n4 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981).  On a motion to dismiss, a court “presumes that general\n5 allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.”  Lujan v.\n6 Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 889 (1990). \n7 B. DFS Lacks Capacity to be Sued\n8 Plaintiffs’ Complaint lists both Clark County and the DFS as parties to this action. \n9 County Defendants argue that DFS cannot be sued under Nevada law.  Under Nevada law, a\n10 plaintiff may sue a political subdivision but not a department of a political subdivision.  Nev.\n11 Rev. Stat. § 41.031(1)-(2).  DFS is a political subdivision department, and thus Plaintiffs may\n12 not maintain a suit against it.  In their Opposition, Plaintiffs consent to dismissing DFS from\n13 this case.  The Court grants Defendants’ request to dismiss DFS from this action.\n14 C.   Request to Dismiss Individually-Named County Commissioners\n15 Plaintiffs have named both Clark County and the County Commissioners in their suit. \n16 County Defendants ask the Court to dismiss the individually-named Commissioners because\n17 they are not proper parties.  Defendants cite to Nev. Rev. Stat. § 12.105 to support their\n18 argument.  However, § 12.105 merely states that Plaintiffs may sue the political subdivision\n19 without naming the individual commissioner.  The Ninth Circuit has stated that a decision to\n20 name both the individual and the political division may be duplicative, but it is not fatal. \n21 Clements v. Airport Auth., 69 F.3d 321, 336 n.20 (9th Cir. 1995).  Courts have allowed\n22 plaintiffs to name both the individual defendants in their official capacities and the agency\n23 when the plaintiffs allege the officials acted beyond their statutory powers or, even though\n24 within the scope of authority, the powers themselves or the manner in which they are\n25 Page 12 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 13 of 48(cid:10)\n1 exercised are constitutionally void.  See, e.g., People of Cal. ex rel. Ervin, 170 F. Supp. 2d\n2 1040, 1045-46 (E.D. Cal. 2001) (citing Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 647 (1962)).  In\n3 this case, Plaintiffs allege that the individually-named Defendants have taken actions that\n4 violate the Constitution.  Thus, while the Court may in its discretion dismiss the individual\n5 Defendants from this case, it refrains from so doing at this stage of the litigation.  If at the\n6 summary judgment stage or after conducting discovery the individual Defendants can\n7 demonstrate they took no part in the alleged violations, then the Court may consider\n8 dismissing them from this suit.\n9 D. Plaintiffs’ 1983 Federal Statutory Claims\n10 Defendants also argue Plaintiffs cannot maintain a § 1983 action for the alleged\n11 federal violations in this case.  Plaintiffs bring their statutory claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C     \n12 § 1983, which imposes liability on anyone who, under color of state law, deprives a person\n13 “of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”  Blessing v.\n14 Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997).  Section 1983 safeguards certain rights conferred by\n15 federal statutes. Id. (citation omitted).  However, to seek redress under § 1983, Plaintiffs\n16 “must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”  Id. \n17 (citation omitted).  Courts examine three factors to determine whether a particular statutory\n18 provision gives rise to a federal right:  \n19\nFirst, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the\n20 plaintiff.  Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly\nprotected by the statute is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its enforcement\n21 would strain judicial competence.  Third, the statute must unambiguously\nimpose a binding obligation on the States.  In other words, the provision\n22 giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than\nprecatory terms.\n23\n24\n25 Page 13 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 14 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Id. (citations omitted).  With this framework in mind, the Court considers Plaintiffs’ federal\n2 statutory claims in turn.  No court within the Ninth Circuit has considered whether a private\n3 individual may bring a cause of action under these statutes.  The Supreme Court has held that\n4 one specific provision under the Adoption Assistance Act did not afford a private right of\n5 action.  Congress subsequently amended the statute to provide a private right of action under\n6 that particular provision, but chose not to amend the remaining statutory provisions.\n3\n7 1. Federal Adoption Assistance Act\n8 Plaintiffs allege that under the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act\n9 (“AACA”) of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Nevada\n10 must (1) submit a child-welfare plan approved by the United States Department of Health and\n11\n3\nSuter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992).  The Suter Court noted that the pertinent inquiry under the Blessing\n12\nframework was whether Congress, in enacting the Adoption Act, unambiguously conferred “upon the child\nbeneficiaries of the Act a right to enforce the requirement that the State make ‘reasonable efforts’ to prevent a child\n13 from being removed from his home, and once removed to reunify the child with his family.”  Suter, 503 U.S. at 357. \nThe Suter Court found that § 671(a)(15) did not unambiguously confer an enforceable right on individual children\n14 within the child welfare system because only “a rather generalized duty” was imposed upon the state, “to be enforced\nnot by private individuals, but by the Secretary” in the manner set forth in the AACA.  Id. at 363.  To the extent that\nSuter may have intimated that § 671(a)(15), or any other section of the AACA for that matter, did not confer a\n15\nprivate right enforceable under          § 1983 simply because of its inclusion in a section requiring a State plan or\nspecifying the required contents of such a plan, Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1994, specifically\n16\nmentioning Suter. This amendment noted the following:\n17  . . . in an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter, such provision is not to be deemed\nunenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying\n18 the required contents of a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand grounds for\ndetermining the availability of private actions to enforce State plan requirements other than by\noverturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992), but not applied in\n19\nprior Supreme Court decisions respecting such enforceability; provided however, that this section is\nnot intended to alter the holding in Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this title is not\n20\nenforceable in a private right of action.\n \n21 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2.  However, this amendment did not overrule Suter. The amendment only forecloses the refusal\nto find a federal right enforceable under § 1983 because the statutory provision may be included in a section\n22 requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of such a plan.  See Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993, 1002\n(11th Cir. 1997) (noting that 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2 “does not purport to reject any and all grounds relied upon in\nSuter; it purports only to overrule certain grounds–i.e., that a provision is unenforceable simply because of its\n23\ninclusion in a section requiring a state plan or specifying the contents of such a plan”).  Therefore, with this guideline\nin mind, the Court examines Plaintiffs’ asserted rights to determine, as noted in Suter, if the provision at issue\n24\nunambiguously confers a private right enforceable pursuant to § 1983.\n25 Page 14 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 15 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Human Services, (2) certify that the plan provides the child welfare services required by the\n2 AACA, and (3) comply with the terms of the Nevada plan.  Plaintiffs argue Defendants have\n3 violated specific statutory provisions they claim create rights sufficient to maintain a § 1983\n4 action.  \n5 a. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10): Right to Placement in Foster Homes\n. . . that Conform to National Standards\n6\nPlaintiffs allege that the AACA requires Defendants to ensure that foster family\n7\nhomes and child care institutions are licensed, relicensed, and operated in conformity with\n8\nappropriate “national standards” to accept federal funds.  In this regard, Plaintiffs allege that\n9\nDefendants’ actions and inactions have deprived Plaintiffs of their right to placement in\n10\nfoster homes or facilities that conform to “nationally recommended professional standards.” \n11\nIn their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argue § 671(a)(10) is too vague under the Blessing\n12\nanalysis mentioned above.\n13\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) provides in relevant part:\n14\n. . . in order for a State to be eligible for payments under [42 U.S.C. § 670], it\n15 shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which -- provides for the\nestablishment or designation of a State authority . . . which shall be\n16 responsible for establishing and maintaining standards for foster family homes\nand child care institutions which are reasonably in accord with recommended\n17 standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such\ninstitutions or homes, including standards related to admission policies, safety,\n18 sanitation, and protection of civil rights, and provides that the standards so\nestablished shall be applied by the State to any foster family home or child\n19 care institution receiving funds under this part or part B of this subchapter.\n20\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10).  Plaintiffs’ alleged right to “placement in foster homes or\n21\nfacilities that conform to nationally recommended professional standards” based upon 42\n22\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(10) is too vague and amorphous under Blessing to be enforced pursuant       \n23\n§ 1983.  First, the very provision Plaintiffs cite in support of their claim “to placement in\n24\n25 Page 15 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 16 of 48(cid:10)\n1 foster homes or facilities that conform to nationally recommended professional standards”\n2 has been rejected as the basis for a private right enforceable under § 1983 by numerous\n3 courts.  See, e.g., Yvonne L. v. N.M. Dep’t of Human Serv., 959 F.2d 883, 889, 890 (10th Cir.\n4 1992) (stating “the language of § 671(a)(10) by itself does not support . . . a cause of action\n5 [for a right to care in a foster home with standards reasonably in accord with those of national\n6 organizations]. It only references ‘standards of national organizations concerned with\n7 standards or such institutions or [foster] homes.’  That is the type of vague and amorphous\n8 language . . . that cannot be judicially enforced”) (citations omitted); Charlie H. v. Whitman,\n9 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 490-92 (D. N.J. 2000) (same).  Courts have also held that “§ 671(a)(10)\n10 fails to unambiguously confer upon plaintiffs a private right of enforcement under this\n11 provision” because “the language of this section does not confer upon plaintiffs a ‘right’ to\n12 foster homes or institutions which are in accord with recommended standards of national\n13 organizations but clearly states that the state plan must provide for the designation of a state\n14 authority or authorities which shall establish and maintain such standards.”  Baby Neal v.\n15 Casey, 821 F. Supp. 320, 326-327 (E.D. Pa. 1993).  Moreover, courts have held that the\n16 ‘reasonably in accord’ language is too vague and ambiguous to maintain a private right of\n17 action.  See Doe v. Johnson, No. 92 C 7661, 1993 WL 50845, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 24, 1993)\n18 (dismissing plaintiff's action “to the extent that it seeks private relief for an alleged violation\n19 of § 671(a) of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act” because “the Act places its\n20 enforcement mechanism in hands other than those of private plaintiffs under § 1983”); see\n21 also Del A. v. Roemer, 777 F. Supp. 1297, 1310 (E.D. La. 1991) (holding that the “provision\n22 requiring placement in foster homes and institutions that are ‘reasonably in accord with’\n23 national standards is vague and unenforceable”).  Moreover, as discussed above in footnote\n24 three, that Congress recently chose to amend 42 U.S.C. § 674 to include a private right of\n25 Page 16 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 17 of 48(cid:10)\n1 action under § 1983 for a state or other entity’s failure to comply with 42 U.S.C.                   \n2 § 671(a)(18), but did not include the other various elements enumerated in 42 U.S.C.            \n3 § 671(a) and relied upon by Plaintiffs, is strong evidence that Congress did not intend           \n4 § 671(a)(10) to confer rights enforceable pursuant to § 1983.  Pursuant to the above analysis,\n5 the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim under 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) for “placement in\n6 foster homes or facilities that conform to nationally recommended professional standards.”\n7 b. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22): The Right to Quality Services that\nProtect Children’s Health & Safety\n8\nPlaintiffs assert that § 671(a)(22) establishes “a right to quality services that protect\n9\nfoster children’s safety and health.”  (#57-7 at 8.)  Section 671(a)(22) provides in relevant\n10\npart that “the State shall develop and implement standards to ensure that children in foster\n11\ncare placements in public or private agencies are provided quality services that protect the\n12\nsafety and health of the children.”  § 671(a)(22).  This language clearly intends to benefit\n13\nfoster children; thus, it satisfies Blessing’s first prong.  However, the language is too “vague\n14\nand amorphous” to support a private cause of action.  See, e.g., Whitley v. N.M. Children,\n15\nYouth & Families Dep’t, 184 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1165 (D. N.M. 2001); Charlie H., 83 F.\n16\nSupp. 2d at 490 n.3.  The language in this section is similar to the language in § 671(a)(10),\n17\nwhich more than one federal circuit and various district courts have held too ambiguous. \n18\nMoreover, as discussed above in footnote three, that Congress recently chose to amend 42\n19\nU.S.C. § 674 to include a private right of action under § 1983 for a state or other entity’s\n20\nfailure to comply with 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(18), but did not include the other various elements\n21\nenumerated in 42 U.S.C. § 671(a) is strong evidence that Congress did not intend                  \n22\n§ 671(a)(22) to confer rights enforceable pursuant to § 1983.  The Court dismisses Plaintiffs’\n23\n§ 1983 claim under 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22).\n24\n25 Page 17 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 18 of 48(cid:10)\n1 c. 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1), and 675(5)(B): Right to\nTimely Written Case Plans\n2\nSection 671(a)(16) requires states “to provide for the development of a case plan (as\n3\ndefined in section 475(1) [42 USCS § 675(1)]) for each child receiving foster care\n4\nmaintenance payments under the State plan and provide for a case review system which\n5\nmeets the requirements described in section 475(5)(B) [42 USCS § 675(5)(B)] with respect to\n6\neach such child . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 675(1) defines the requirements for a “case plan” and      \n7\n§ 675(5) defines the requirements for a “case review system.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1) and (5). \n8\nUnlike the above analyzed sections, the case-plan provisions provide specific detailed\n9\ninstructions.  The federal courts that have analyzed these sections are split on whether they\n10\nprovide a private right of action.  \n11\nIn analyzing whether §§ 675(5)(C) and 671(a)(16) provide a private right of action,\n12\nthe Court must look to Blessing.  First, it is clear that Plaintiffs are the intentional\n13\nbeneficiaries under these provisions.  Second, the terms of these two provisions are not so\n14\n“vague and amorphous” that their enforcement would strain judicial competence.  Unlike the\n15\n“reasonable efforts,” “national standards,” and “safe” language analyzed above, the\n16\nrequirements needed to form a case plan are fairly specific in that a judge can determine\n17\nwhether a state plan contains such a system.  Indeed, many courts have held that most\n18\nprovisions under the AACA fail to provide a private right of action, yet these same courts\n19\nhave also held that § 671(a)(16) affords foster children a private cause of action.  See, e.g.,\n20\nB.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387, 1405 (N.D. Ill. 1989).  Finally, § 671 of the Act\n21\nunambiguously imposes a binding obligation on the states if they accept federal funds.  Thus,\n22\nit is clear that Congress intended to impose a requirement on states that would specifically\n23\nbenefit foster care children such as Plaintiffs.  See Occean v. Kearney, 123 F. Supp. 2d 618,\n24\n25 Page 18 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 19 of 48(cid:10)\n1 625 (D. Fla. 2000) (analyzing § 671(a)(16) and concluding that it provides a private cause of\n2 action).  The Court therefore denies Defendants’ request to dismiss Plaintiffs’ federal claims\n3 under these sections.  \n4 d. 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii), and 675(5)(A): Right to\nPlacement in the Least Restrictive, Most Family-Like\n5 Setting\n6 Plaintiffs allege Defendants must ensure that each child in need of a foster care\n7 placement is placed in the least restrictive, most family-like setting available, consistent with\n8 the child’s best interests and individual needs.  In this regard, Plaintiffs allege that\n9 Defendants’ actions and inactions deprived them of the right to “placement in the least\n10 restrictive, most family-like setting.”  Because 42 U.S.C. § 675(5) is a definitional section,\n11 standing alone, it does not confer a right upon Plaintiffs enforceable pursuant to § 1983.  See\n12 B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387, 1401 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (noting that “it would be strange\n13 for Congress to create enforceable rights solely in the definitional section of a statute”).  Most\n14 courts deciding this issue have held that this section does not create a private right of action. \n15 See, e.g., id. (holding that while the AACA “creates an enforceable right to an individualized\n16 ‘case plan’ and ‘case review system, . . . beyond the narrow requirements of a case plan and\n17 case review system, the AA[C]A does not impose on the state the sweeping duties alleged by\n18 plaintiffs” and specifically holding that “we do not believe Congress intended to create an\n19 enforceable individual right of placement in the least restrictive (most family-like) setting”). \n20 Moreover, several courts have rejected similar claims under § 1983 to enforce the right to\n21 placement in the least restrictive, most family-like setting because such a right is too vague\n22 and amorphous to be judicially enforceable.  See Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v.\n23 Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1981) (holding that “it is difficult to know what is meant by\n24 providing ‘appropriate treatment’ in the ‘least restrictive’ setting”); Aristotle P. v. Johnson,\n25 Page 19 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 20 of 48(cid:10)\n1 721 F. Supp. 1002, 1012 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (holding that the “right to be placed ‘in the least\n2 restrictive, most family like setting’ . . . [is] amorphous and not subject to precise definition”)\n3 (citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 24-25).  The Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim under 42\n4 U.S.C. § 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) and/or 42 U.S.C. § 675(5) to placement in the least restrictive,\n5 most family-like setting.\n6 e. 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(5)(D) and 622(b)(10)(B)(ii): Right to\nHealth and Educational Records Reviewed\n7\nIn connection with the case-review system described above, Plaintiffs ask this Court\n8\nto recognize a right to updated health and educational records for Plaintiff foster children. \n9\nSpecifically, the statutes state in pertinent part:\n10\n. . . a child’s health and education record (as described in paragraph (1)(A)) is\n11 reviewed and updated, and a copy of the record is supplied to the foster parent\nor foster care provider with whom the child is placed, at the time of each\n12 placement of the child in foster care, and is supplied to the child at no cost at\nthe time the child leaves foster care if the child is leaving foster care by reason\n13 of having attained the age of majority under State law . . . .\n14 As analyzed above, the AACA provides a private right of action with regards to\n15 Plaintiffs’ timely written case plans.  Plaintiffs now ask the Court to recognize a cause of\n16 action for this specific provision under the case plan.  First, it is clear that Plaintiffs are an\n17 intentional beneficiary under these provisions, which require a case review system including\n18 various procedural safeguards for each child in custody.  Second, the terms of these health-\n19 and-educational-records provisions are not so “vague and amorphous” that their enforcement\n20 would strain judicial competence.  Unlike the “reasonable efforts,” “national standards,” and\n21 “safe” language above, the statute specifically states what records should be forwarded along\n22 with the foster child.  Thus, the Court denies County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as it\n23 relates to this claim.  \n24\n25 Page 20 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 21 of 48(cid:10)\n1 f. 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(G): Foster Parent’s Right to\nNotice of Hearing \n2\nThe statute states that a case-review system must include a procedure for ensuring that\n3\n“the foster parents (if any) of a child and any preadoptive parent or relative providing care for\n4\nthe child are provided with notice of, and a right to be heard in, any proceeding to be held\n5\nwith respect to the child . . . .”  § 675(5)(G).  This language satisfies the Blessing test.  First,\n6\nthe foster child is clearly the intended beneficiary under this section.  Second, the right\n7\nprotected by the statute is neither vague nor amorphous.  The statute’s plain language\n8\nunambiguously states that any foster parent or preadoptive parent providing care for the child\n9\nmust receive notice of a hearing and have the right to be heard.  The states must comply with\n10\nthis provision to receive federal funding.  The Court therefore denies County Defendants’\n11\nMotion to Dismiss based on this cause of action.\n12\ng. “All Other Rights”\n13\nPlaintiffs also ask the Court to recognize all other rights under 42 U.S.C.                  \n14\n§§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) and 675(5).  However, as noted above, determining whether Plaintiffs’\n15\nhave a private cause of action requires the Court to analyze Plaintiffs’ specific allegations and\n16\neach specific statute to consider if Congress has provided Plaintiff a private right of action. \n17\nPlaintiffs have not stated how “all other rights” applies to the asserted wrongs.  Therefore, the\n18\nCourt dismisses this claim with leave to amend.  \n19\n2. Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act\n20\nPlaintiffs allege Defendants violated their right to a guardian ad litem in all\n21\nproceedings before a juvenile court in violation of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment\n22\nAct (“CAPTA”).  42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii).  The relevant statutory provision states in\n23\npart:\n24\n25 Page 21 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 22 of 48(cid:10)\n1 . . . that in every case involving an abused or neglected child which results in a\njudicial proceeding, a guardian ad litem, who has received training appropriate\n2 to the role, and who may be an attorney or a court appointed special advocate\nwho has received training appropriate to that role (or both), shall be appointed\n3 to represent the child in such proceedings . . . .\n4 42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii).\n5 As to Blessing’s first prong, the language clearly indicates that Plaintiffs (foster\n6 children) are the intended beneficiaries of the CAPTA provisions at issue.  Moreover, the\n7 statutory language  requires that “in every case” the state must provide a guardian ad litem.\n8 The statute sets forth clear conditions the state must satisfy to qualify for a federal grant and\n9 does so through the use of mandatory and not precatory language.  Further, the CAPTA\n10 provision at issue is not so vague and amorphous as to be beyond the enforcement power of\n11 the Court.  This Court certainly is competent to determine whether Defendants have made\n12 any efforts to comply with this provision.  While Defendants may very well prevail on this\n13 claim at trial or at summary judgment, Plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for the purposes of\n14 surviving Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \n15 3. Medicaid Act \n16 Plaintiffs also claim Defendants have “failed to provide Medicaid-eligible children\n17 with the full range of services covered by Medicaid when such services are deemed necessary\n18 . . . .”  (#57-8 at 1.)  Plaintiffs allege this failure violates 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10),\n19 1396d(a)(4)(B), and 1396d(r).\n20 a. 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(10)\n21 The Ninth Circuit has never analyzed whether this statute provides a private right of\n22 action.  Plaintiffs argue this section requires Plaintiffs to provide medical services.  However,\n23 there appears to be some disagreement among the courts of appeal as to whether, pursuant to\n24 the Medicaid Act, a state must merely provide financial assistance to eligible individuals to\n25 Page 22 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 23 of 48(cid:10)\n1 enable them to obtain covered services, or provide the services directly.  See Sabree v.\n2 Richman, 367 F.3d 180, 181 n.1 (3d Cir. 2004); Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906,\n3 910 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he statutory reference to ‘assistance’ appears to have reference to\n4 financial assistance rather than to actual medical services, though the distinction was missed\n5 in Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79, 81, 88-89 (1st Cir. 2002), and Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d\n6 709, 714, 717 (11th Cir. 1998).”).  The Medicaid Act explicitly defines the term “medical\n7 assistance” as used in § 1396a(a)(10):  “payment of part or all of the cost of the [enumerated]\n8 services” to eligible individuals “who are under the age of 21.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a); Schott\n9 v. Olszewski, 401 F.3d 682, 686 (6th Cir. 2005) (“The Act defines ‘medical assistance’ as\n10 ‘payment of part or all of the cost of the [covered] care and services . . . for individuals.’”). \n11 Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that the language of §1396a(a)(10) expands the definition of\n12 “medical assistance” beyond simply payment for services to include actual provision of\n13 services.  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have “failed to provide . . . the\n14 full range of services covered by Medicaid . . . .”  (#57-8 at 1.)  Plaintiffs continually allege\n15 that Defendants have failed to provide services, not financial assistance, as required under the\n16 statute.  After examining the text and the structure of the statute, the Sixth Circuit held that\n17 1396a(a)(10) did not require the State to provide medical services directly.  Westside Mothers\n18 v. Olszewski, 454 F.3d 532, 541 (6th Cir. 2006).  According to the Sixth Circuit’s recent\n19 decision (the most recent on this statute), “[t]he most reasonable interpretation of                  \n20 § 1396a(a)(10) is that medical assistance, i.e., financial assistance, must be provided for at\n21 least the care and services listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), (17) and (21) of § 1396d(a).” \n22 Id. citing (Clark v. Richman, 339 F. Supp. 2d 631, 641 (M.D. Pa. 2004)).\n23 Because Defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim, the\n24 Court must concern itself with the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which do not allege\n25 Page 23 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 24 of 48(cid:10)\n1 that Defendants have failed to provide financial assistance as required by § 1396a(10). \n2 Rather, Plaintiffs contend Defendants have failed to provide the actual services.  The Court\n3 therefore dismisses with leave to amend the claim for violations of § 1396a(a)(10).  \n4 b. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(4)(B)4\n5 As noted above, the Ninth Circuit has not interpreted the statutes at issue in this case. \n6 However, it has analyzed another provision of § 1396a.  Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051\n7 (9th Cir. 2005).  In Sanchez, the Ninth Circuit stated: \n8 Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) sets out a comprehensive list of requirements\nthat a state plan must meet, it does not describe every requirement in the same\n9 language.  Some requirements, such as those addressed in Sabree, focus on\nindividual recipients, while others are concerned with the procedural\n10 administration of the Medicaid Act by the States and only refer to recipients, if\nat all, in the aggregate. Section 30(A) is one of the latter provisions; it is\n11 directly concerned with the State as administrator and only indirectly with\nrecipients and providers as beneficiaries of the administered services.\n12 Gonzaga made it clear that simply being the intended beneficiary of a statute\nis not enough to demonstrate the intentional creation of an enforceable right.\n13\nId. at 1062.  The Court then went on to hold that the statute failed the Blessing test.  The\n14\nlanguage at issue in § 1396a(4)(B) is similar to that which the Ninth Circuit analyzed in\n15\nSanchez.  Just as with the language at issue in Sanchez, Section 1396a(4)(B) focuses not on\n16\nthe individual recipient of Medicaid; rather, it focuses on “the procedural administration of\n17\nthe Medicaid Act . . . .”  Id.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ claims under 42\n18\nU.S.C. § 1396a(4)(B).  Further, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ remaining Medicaid claims\n19\nbecause they necessarily flow from these dismissed claims.  \n20\n21\n442 U.S.C. § 1396a(4)(B) states that a state plan must provide “for the training and effective use\n22 of paid subprofessional staff, with particular emphasis on the full-time or part-time employment\nof recipients and other persons of low income, as community service aides, in the administration\n23 of the plan and for the use of nonpaid or partially paid volunteers in a social service volunteer\nprogram in providing services to applicants and recipients and in assisting any advisory\n24 committees established by the State agency . . . .”  \n25 Page 24 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 25 of 48(cid:10)\n1 E. Plaintiffs’ Federal Constitutional Claims \n2 Plaintiffs also allege three constitutional causes of action.  First, Plaintiffs allege\n3 Defendants have deprived them of their substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth\n4 Amendment.  Second, Plaintiffs argue Defendants have violated their rights by systematically\n5 creating dangers that deprive them of their substantive due process rights (state-created\n6 danger).  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have violated their procedural due\n7 process rights.\n8 1. Substantive Due Process \n9 Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have deprived them of the following rights: \n10 . . . the right to protection for unnecessary harm while in government custody;\nthe right to a living environment that protects foster children’s physical,\n11 mental, and emotional safety and well-being; the right to services necessary to\nprevent foster children from deteriorating or being harmed physically,\n12 developmentally, psychologically, or otherwise while in government custody,\nincluding but not limited to the right to safe and secure foster care placements,\n13 appropriate monitoring and supervision, appropriate planning and services\ndirected to toward ensu[r]ing that the child can leave foster care and grow up\n14 in a permanent family, adequate mental, dental, psychiatric, psychological,\nand educational services; the right to treatment and care consistent with the\n15 purpose of the assumption of custody by Defendants; the right not to be\nretained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes to be\n16 served by taking the child into custody; the right to be placed in the least\nrestrictive placement based on the foster child’s needs; and the right to receive\n17 care, treatment, and services determined and provided through the exercise of\naccepted, reasonable professional judgment.\n18\n(#57 at 60.)  \n19\nInitially, with respect to foster children in custody, the Court must draw a distinction\n20\nbetween those children involuntarily within state custody and those voluntarily within state\n21\ncustody, if such a distinction exists among Plaintiffs.  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t\n22\nof Social Serv., 489 U.S. 189, 201 (1989) (holding that “in the substantive due process\n23\nanalysis, it is the State’s affirmative act of restraining the individual’s freedom to act on his\n24\n25 Page 25 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 26 of 48(cid:10)\n1 own behalf—through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal\n2 liberty—which is the ‘deprivation of liberty’ triggering the protections of the Due Process\n3 Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interest against harms by other means”).  See\n4 also Milburn v. Anne Arundel County Dep’t of Social Serv., 871 F.2d 474, 476 (4th Cir.\n5 1989) (noting that “the State of Maryland by the affirmative exercise of its power had not\n6 restrained the plaintiff’s liberty; he was voluntarily placed in the foster home by his natural\n7 parents”).  Plaintiffs do not clearly state in their Complaint whether Plaintiffs are children in\n8 state custody voluntarily.  However, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss with\n9 respect to the First Count of Plaintiffs’ Complaint to the extent Plaintiffs’ allege a substantive\n10 due process claim on behalf of children voluntarily in state custody.  See id.  \n11 With respect to Plaintiffs involuntarily in foster custody, courts have held that\n12 children “who have been involuntarily placed in the custody of [the state] may state a claim\n13 for violation of their substantive due process rights based upon their right to freedom from\n14 harm under the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.”  See, e.g., Baby\n15 Neal v. Casey, 821 F. Supp. 320, 335 (E.D. Pa. 1993).  In addition, Courts have also held that\n16 foster children have a right to the required “professional judgment” while in custody.  See,\n17 e.g., Wendy H. v. Philadelphia, 849 F. Supp. 367, 372 (E.D. Pa. 1994).  Defendants’ alleged\n18 conduct of ignoring warnings and reports of abuse prior to and during the placement process\n19 could constitute a failure to adhere to the “professional judgment” standard.  Jordan v.\n20 Philadelphia, 66 F. Supp. 2d 638, 646 (E.D. Pa. 1999).  However, this right to freedom from\n21 harm is not without boundaries.  Specifically, under the Fourteenth Amendment, Nevada is\n22 required to provide to individuals within state custody their “basic human needs,” such as\n23 “food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety.”  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200\n24 (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs do not, however, have a substantive due process right to “not\n25 Page 26 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 27 of 48(cid:10)\n1 be retained in custody longer than is necessary . . . ,” nor do Plaintiffs have a substantive due\n2 process right “to be placed in the least restrictive placement based on the foster child’s\n3 needs.”  See Baby Neal, 821 F. Supp. at 335 (dismissing plaintiffs’ claims for “permanent\n4 placements or placement in preadoptive homes pending their adoption”); see also Charlie H.\n5 Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 507 (D. N.J. 2000) (holding that foster children do not have a\n6 due process right to be free from unlimited custody or to be placed in the least restrictive\n7 housing possible).  Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss with respect\n8 to count one to the extent Plaintiffs assert a substantive due process claim on behalf of\n9 children involuntarily in state custody to “not be retained in custody longer than is necessary.\n10 . . ,” or to “to be placed in the least restrictive placement based on the foster child’s needs.”\n11 2. Substantive Due Process: State-Created Danger\n12 Plaintiffs have not sufficiently stated a claim for state-created danger in their\n13 Complaint.  “The state-created danger doctrine requires more than a mere failure to act; it\n14 requires the state official to take an affirmative action.”  Kennedy v. Ridgefield City, 440 F.3d\n15 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2006).  “Second, the plaintiff must prove that the official’s act did more\n16 than simply expose the plaintiff to a danger that already existed.”  Id. (citations omitted). \n17 Finally, the plaintiff must prove that the official acted with deliberate indifference to known\n18 or obvious dangers.  See L.W. v. Grubbs, 92 F.3d 894, 900 (9th Cir. 1996) (“The plaintiff\n19 must show that the state official participated in creating a dangerous condition, and acted\n20 with deliberate indifference to the known or obvious danger in subjecting the plaintiff to it.”). \n21 The Supreme Court has stated that negligence, whether gross or simple, is insufficient to\n22 prove a constitutional violation.  See Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986) (“The\n23 Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing\n24 unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.”).\n25 Page 27 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 28 of 48(cid:10)\n1 While Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants affirmatively acted with deliberate\n2 indifference by placing Plaintiffs in situations Defendants knew or should have known posed\n3 an imminent risk, Plaintiffs have failed to allege the second element necessary to sufficiently\n4 plead an action for state-created danger.  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants placed\n5 foster children into situations that they knew were already dangerous.  However, Plaintiff\n6 must allege and “prove that the official’s act did more than simply expose the plaintiff to a\n7 danger that already existed.”  Kennedy, 440 F.3d at 1094.  Plaintiffs have not alleged that\n8 Defendants did anything more than place foster children into an already broken system. \n9 Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not state that Defendants created or increased the danger to\n10 children, just that they failed to correct it.  Thus, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion to\n11 Dismiss as it relates to Plaintiffs’ second cause of action, with leave to amend.\n12 3. Procedural Due Process \n13 Although some courts have held that foster children cannot state a claim for\n14 procedural due process violations because the state juvenile court and administrative\n15 procedures provide sufficient due process, Defendants failed to brief this issue.  Plaintiffs\n16 allege Defendants failed to provide those procedures.  In other words, Plaintiffs contend that\n17 Defendants systematically ignore the statutorily-created procedures.  Thus, at the pleading\n18 stage, Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for which the Court may grant relief.\n19 F. Federal Common-Law Claim (Count Ten)\n20 Plaintiffs’ allege they are third-party beneficiaries to the “State Plan” contract\n21 between Nevada and the federal government.  Pursuant to the AACA and federal common\n22 law, Plaintiffs assert a cause of action for violation of their rights under that contract.  While\n23 Defendants ask the Court to dismiss this claim, they provide no argument as to why the Court\n24 must do so.\n25 Page 28 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 29 of 48(cid:10)\n1 The Supreme Court has held that legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power\n2 of Congress is much in the nature of a contract: “in return for federal funds, the States agree\n3 to comply with federally imposed conditions.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman,\n4 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  It is also recognized that, under certain circumstances, parties can be\n5 third-party beneficiaries to contracts between the federal government and local or state\n6 agencies.  See, e.g., Concerned Tenants Ass’n of Father Panik Village v. Pierce, 685 F. Supp.\n7 316, 324 (D. Conn. 1988) (stating that tenants have enforceable rights as intended\n8 beneficiaries to obtain compliance with obligations under contract between HUD and local\n9 agency).\n10 Although it is true that the United States is a party, through its Department of Health\n11 and Human Services, to the alleged contract at issue, the United States is not a party to this\n12 action.  The Complaint raises no question regarding the liability of the United States or the\n13 responsibilities of the United States under the alleged contract.  In determining whether\n14 Plaintiffs are intended third-party beneficiaries of the alleged contract in this case, the Court\n15 must first decide whether federal or state common law applies.  See Miree v. DeKalb County,\n16 433 U.S. 25, 28 (1977) (holding that state law applied to petitioners’ breach-of-contract claim\n17 as third-party beneficiaries); see also Dewakuku v. Cuomo, 107 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1131 (D.\n18 Ariz. 2000) (stating that federal common law applies to third-party beneficiary claims when a\n19 federal agency is a party to the action and the outcome may directly affect financial\n20 obligations of the United States).\n21 The “contract” between the parties is not before the Court. Therefore, the full scope of\n22 the United States’ interests is not clear for purposes of making the threshold determination of\n23 whether federal or state common law applies.  In any event, the Court cannot determine the\n24 rights of the parties to a contract that is not in the record.  Further, Defendants have failed to\n25 Page 29 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 30 of 48(cid:10)\n1 argue why the Court should dismiss this claim.  Therefore, the Court denies Defendants’\n2 Motion to Dismiss as it relates to Plaintiffs’ tenth cause of action, without prejudice to the\n3 filing of a motion for summary judgment addressing these issues.\n4 G. Immunity From Federal Claims\n5 Defendants argue they are immune from Plaintiffs’ federal claims.  While Nevada has\n6 not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, under the Ex Parte Young doctrine, the\n7 Eleventh Amendment permits official capacity suits against state officials for injunctive\n8 relief.  Duke Energy Trading and Mktg., L.L.C. v. Davis, 267 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2001)\n9 (citing Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908)).  In their Motion to Dismiss, County\n10 Defendants incorrectly argue they are immune from suit based on qualified and absolute\n11 immunity doctrines that are applicable in individual capacity lawsuits.  However, Plaintiffs\n12 file this suit against County Defendants in their official capacities.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint\n13 contains numerous allegations that County Defendants are directly connected to the\n14 enforcement of the acts in question.  Accordingly, the Court finds that County Defendants are\n15 not immune from Plaintiffs’ suit seeking prospective injunctive relief.\n16 H. Immunity From State Claims\n17 County Defendants ask the Court to dismiss all state claims against them due to\n18 immunity.  Under Nev. Rev. Stat. § 41.032(2), County Defendants are only immune from\n19 liability for their discretionary acts and omissions, not ministerial acts.  Section 41.032\n20 provides, in pertinent part:\n21 . . . No action may be brought under NRS 41.031 [(the State’s limited waiver\nof immunity)] or against an immune contractor or an officer or employee of\n22 the state or any of its agencies or political subdivisions which is:\n. . . .\n23\n2. Based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or\n24 perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of the state or any of its\n25 Page 30 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 31 of 48(cid:10)\n1 agencies or political subdivisions or of any officer, employee or immune\ncontractor of any of these, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\n2\nNev. Rev. Stat. § 41.032.  The Nevada Supreme Court has defined discretionary acts as\n3\n“those which require the exercise of personal deliberation, decision and judgment.” \n4\nTravelers Hotel v. Reno, 741 P.2d 1353, 1354 (Nev. 1987).  \n5\nIn Foster v. Washoe County, the Nevada Supreme Court held that an investigation\n6\ninto alleged child abuse “involves ‘personal deliberation, decision and judgment’ and cannot\n7\nbe construed as ministerial.”  964 P.2d 788, 794 (Nev. 1998).  County Defendants argue that\n8\nin accordance with Foster, “plaintiffs’ claims against the Individual Clark County Defendants\n9\nshould be dismissed as the alleged violations of plaintiffs’ rights . . . are based upon\n10\ndiscretionary acts protected under NRS 41.032.”  (#104 at 14.)  Plaintiffs argue that County\n11\nDefendants have violated numerous statutory provisions.  To determine whether they involve\n12\ndiscretionary or ministerial duties, the Court briefly examines the alleged statutory violations\n13\nin Plaintiffs’ state law claims.\n14\n1. Seventh Cause of Action\n15\nPlaintiffs’ seventh cause of action alleges procedural due process violations under the\n16\nNevada Constitution for failure to enforce several statutes.  County Defendants argue they are\n17\nimmune from liability under these statutes based on Foster.  However, in Foster the Court\n18\nheld that the manner in which the defendants conducted their investigation was discretionary;\n19\nthe court did not hold that the decision to initiate an investigation in the first place was\n20\ndiscretionary.  As analyzed below, all but one statute in question imposes ministerial duties\n21\nupon County Defendants.  However, just as in Foster, the manner in which County\n22\nDefendants perform the ministerial duties is discretionary.  Therefore, the Court dismisses all\n23\nclaims based on how County Defendants carried out their ministerial duties, but the Court\n24\n25 Page 31 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 32 of 48(cid:10)\n1 does not dismiss Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action as it relates to County Defendants’ failure\n2 to initiate the ministerial duties in the first place.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated, and\n3 continue to violate, the following statutes:\n4 (1)   Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 432B.500 and 432B.505: (appointment of Guardian ad\n5 litem.).\n6 (2) Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.260: (discretionary as it relates to children five years\n7 or younger.)  Therefore, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action\n8 with regards to this statute for children over five years.  \n9 (3) Nev. Admin. Code §§ 424.160 & 424.805: (imposing ministerial duties upon\n10 County Defendants in relation to number of children allowed in foster homes)\n11 (4) Nev. Admin. Code §§ 432B.405 & 424.565: (stating that the agencies in\n12 question shall ensure that . . . . ).\n13 (5) Nev. Admin. Code §§ 432B.185: (stating that the “agency which provides\n14 child welfare services shall assess the safety of a child who is the subject of a\n15 report made pursuant to NRS 432B.220 or an investigation initiated pursuant\n16 to NRS 432B.260 at each phase of intervention in which child welfare\n17 services are provided. Those phases include, without limitation: . . . .).  \n18 (6) Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 432A.040; 432A.070; 432A.210; and Nev. Admin. Code\n19 §§ 432A.170; 432A.180: (imposing mandatory duty to ensure that child care\n20 facilities are licensed prior to placement of children).\n21 (7) Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.340: (requiring residential institutions be\n22 responsible to provide the necessary resources to prevent harm to children).\n23 (8) Nev. Admin. Code § 424,530: (listing examples of unacceptable disciplinary\n24 techniques).\n25 Page 32 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 33 of 48(cid:10)\n1 (9) Nev. Rev. Stat. § 127.330: (imposing mandatory notice requirements upon\n2 Nevada agencies before they can send a child in foster custody to another\n3 state).\n4 These statutory provisions relate to mandatory, ministerial duties.5  However, the\n5 Court dismisses all claims based on how County Defendants carried out their ministerial\n6 duties because the Nevada Supreme Court has held that such behavior requires discretionary\n7 acts, but the Court does not dismiss Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action as it relates to County\n8 Defendants’ failure to initiate the ministerial duties in the first place.\n9 2. Remaining State law Claims \n10 Plaintiffs’ remaining state law claims—counts eight and nine—follow the same\n11 analysis as count seven.  Plaintiffs may maintain claims against Plaintiffs inasmuch as they\n12 claim County Defendants failed to even initiate the relevant statutory requirements, but\n13 Plaintiffs cannot maintain an action based on the manner in which Defendants carried out\n14 their duties because those decisions involve “‘personal deliberation, decision and judgment’\n15 and cannot be construed as ministerial.”  Foster v. Washoe County 964 P.2d 788, 794 (Nev.\n16 1998).  Accordingly, Defendants are immune from liability for those discretionary decisions. \n17 I. Younger Abstention\n18 County Defendants also argue that even if Plaintiffs have standing, the Court should\n19 refrain from exercising federal jurisdiction as required in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37\n20 (1971).  “Absent ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ abstention in favor of state judicial\n21 proceedings is required if the state proceedings (1) are ongoing, (2) implicate important state\n22 interests, and (3) provide the plaintiff an adequate opportunity to litigate federal claims.” \n23 5Except Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.260 as it relates to children over five years.  The Court dismisses\nthis cause of action with regards to this statutory section inasmuch as Plaintiffs allege a violation\n24 for children over five years.  \n25 Page 33 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 34 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Hirsh v. Justices of Supreme Court of Cal., 67 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 1995) (citation\n2 omitted).  The abstention doctrine is “an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a\n3 District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.”  Colo. River Water\n4 Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 (1976) (citation omitted).  \n5 In this case, there is no dispute that Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek\n6 to represent are involved in ongoing deprivation proceedings in the juvenile court.  Nor is\n7 there any dispute that these proceedings implicate important state interests in the care,\n8 disposition, and welfare of deprived children.  Therefore, to determine whether to abstain, the\n9 Court considers whether these proceedings will interfere with the ongoing state proceedings\n10 and whether the state proceedings afford Plaintiffs an adequate opportunity to raise their\n11 federal claims.  At this time, the Court defers ruling on abstention.  \n12 Plaintiffs have periodic reviews before the state juvenile courts.  Plaintiffs claim that\n13 the declaratory and injunctive relief they seek is not directed at the state review hearings, or at\n14 Nevada’s juvenile courts, juvenile court judges, or juvenile court personnel.  According to\n15 Plaintiffs, they seek relief directed solely at executive branch and County Defendants to\n16 remedy their alleged failures as Plaintiffs’ custodians.  If Plaintiffs’ claims are proven, an\n17 order by this Court remedying such failures might not interfere with ongoing juvenile court\n18 proceedings.  However, at this time, the Court cannot conclude the ongoing juvenile court\n19 proceedings do not afford Plaintiffs an adequate opportunity to raise their federal claims. \n20 Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and others to remedy\n21 ongoing violations of their rights.  \n22 Defendants claim the juvenile courts lack jurisdiction to afford the requested relief. \n23 Nevada’s juvenile court system “is the creation of statute, and it only possesses the\n24 jurisdiction expressly provided for it in the statute.”  Kell v. State, 618 P.2d 350, 351 (Nev.\n25 Page 34 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 35 of 48(cid:10)\n1 1980).  Juvenile court jurisdiction is limited to “any matter within the purview of this title.” \n2 Nev. Rev. Stat. § 62B.310(1).  Accordingly, juvenile court jurisdiction is limited to making\n3 determinations regarding individual children who are in “need of protection” as set forth in\n4 Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.410.  Although juvenile court judges are authorized to make a variety\n5 of decisions to protect abused and neglected children, they are not authorized to make\n6 determinations regarding system-wide violations of the civil rights of plaintiff children or\n7 issue orders concerning the systemic reform of Clark County’s child welfare system.  As\n8 mentioned above, Plaintiffs’ cases are currently pending in the juvenile system.  The Court\n9 cannot make a determination at this time if the juvenile court system has failed to afford\n10 Plaintiffs the relief they request.  Plaintiffs have recently initiated their claims in state courts. \n11 The state courts may very well remedy Plaintiffs’ circumstances.  Thus, the Court defers\n12 ruling on abstention as it relates to the argument that the juvenile courts cannot remedy the\n13 alleged violations at issue in Plaintiffs’ case.  The Court will reevaluate abstention on these\n14 grounds after the juvenile courts have sufficient time to address Plaintiffs’ cases.  Further,\n15 because the Court defers ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, it does not\n16 address whether the juvenile court system lacks jurisdiction to address the alleged system-\n17 wide deficiencies with the foster care system.  When the Court later addresses the Motion for\n18 Class Certification, it will again readdress the abstention argument.\n19 Defendants also argue the Court should follow 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d\n20 1255 (11th Cir. 2003) and abstain from hearing this case.  This case, however, is\n21 distinguishable from 31 Foster Children.  The relief requested in 31 Foster Children went far\n22 beyond what is sought here.  Plaintiffs in 31 Foster Children sought “to have the district\n23 court appoint a panel and give it authority to implement a system wide plan to revamp and\n24 reform dependency proceedings in Florida, as well as the appointment of a permanent\n25 Page 35 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 36 of 48(cid:10)\n1 children’s advocate to oversee that plan.”  Id. at 1279.   Plaintiffs request no such relief in\n2 this case.  Also, in 31 Foster Children, the court of appeals noted that “the federal and state\n3 courts could well differ, issuing conflicting orders about what is best for a particular plaintiff,\n4 such as whether a particular placement is safe or appropriate or whether sufficient efforts are\n5 being made to find an adoptive family.”  Id. at 1278.  In this case, however, Plaintiffs do not\n6 ask the Court to make individualized determinations with respect to particular foster children. \n7 Instead, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief on a system-wide basis.  Certainly, if\n8 Plaintiffs modify their requested relief and ask this Court to overtake the foster care system or\n9 to act as a de facto supervisor, this Court should abstain.  However, at this time, based on the\n10 above analysis, the Court does not abstain from exercising federal jurisdiction in regards to\n11 Defendants’ reliance on 31 Foster Children.\n12 III. Governor Gibbons’s Motion to Dismiss\n13 Governor Gibbons moves the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint because (1)\n14 Plaintiffs lack standing, (2) Eleventh Amendment immunity as to the federal claims, and (3)\n15 Plaintiffs have failed to state valid claims or otherwise establish a sufficient causal\n16 connection between the Governor and the alleged wrongs.\n17 A. Standing \n18 Pursuant to the standing analysis above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing\n19 to bring their action.  Thus, the Court denies the Governor’s Motion with regards to standing.\n20 B. Immunity and Plaintiffs’ Federal Claims  \n21 The Governor argues he is immune from Plaintiffs’ federal claims.  While Nevada has\n22 not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, under the Ex Parte Young doctrine, the\n23 Eleventh Amendment permits official capacity suits against state officials for injunctive\n24 relief.  Duke Energy Trading and Mktg., L.L.C. v. Davis, 267 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2001)\n25 Page 36 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 37 of 48(cid:10)\n1 (citing Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908)).  However, under the Ex Parte Young\n2 exception, “the state official sued ‘must have some connection with the enforcement of the\n3 act’ to avoid making that official a mere representative of the state.”  Culinary Workers\n4 Union, Local 226 v. Del Papa, 200 F.3d 614, 619 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Ex Parte Young,\n5 209 U.S. at 157) (emphasis added).  This connection “must be fairly direct; a generalized\n6 duty to enforce state law or general supervisory power over those persons responsible for\n7 enforcing the challenged provision will not subject an official to suit.”  L.A. County Bar\n8 Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704 (9th Cir. 1992) (citations omitted).  \n9 Defendant Governor does not dispute that the Ex Parte Young doctrine allows a\n10 plaintiff to sue a state official in his official capacity for prospective injunctive relief; rather,\n11 Defendant Governor argues that Ex Parte Young does not apply in this case because he does\n12 not have the requisite “connection with the enforcement of the act.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that\n13 Governor Gibbons has the requisite enforcement connection based on several federal statutes. \n14 First, Plaintiffs argue that 42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A) creates the necessary connection\n15 between the Governor and federal statutes in question.  42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A) states in\n16 relevant part that to receive federal funds under the federal child abuse statutory provisions,\n17 Nevada must submit a plan to the federal government wherein the Governor provides “an\n18 assurance in the form of a certification by the chief executive officer of the State that the\n19 State has in effect and is enforcing a State law, or has in effect and is operating a Statewide\n20 program, relating to child abuse and neglect that includes--. . . .”  § 5106a(b)(2)(A) (emphasis\n21 added).  The statute then lists numerous requirements that a state foster care program must\n22 have to receive federal funding.  However, this statute does not state that the Governor is\n23 connected to the implementation, enforcement, funding, or running of any foster care\n24 program.  This statute simply requires the Governor to acknowledge that the state has such a\n25 Page 37 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 38 of 48(cid:10)\n1 program if the state wants federal funding.  The statute does not create any enforcement\n2 rights in the Governor.  To impose an injunction on the Governor to fix Nevada’s foster care\n3 system based on this statute would have no real practical effect.\n4 Second, Plaintiffs point to Nev. Rev. Stat. § 422.260.  However, just as with              \n5 § 5106a(b)(2)(A), § 422.260 does not impose upon or otherwise create any enforcement\n6 authority in the Governor of the relevant statutes at issue in this case.  Section 422.260\n7 simply states that Nevada will accept federal funds from the federal government, with the\n8 governor’s approval.  Finally, Plaintiffs state that Nev. Rev. Stat. § 232.210 creates the\n9 requisite connection between the Governor and the enforcement provisions at issue in this\n10 case.  However, § 232.210 simply outlines the requirement for the Director of the Department\n11 of Health and Human Services and states that the director “serves at the pleasure of the\n12 governor.”  \n13 The statues upon which Plaintiffs sue the Governor in his official capacity for\n14 injunctive relief do not satisfy the requirement that “the state official sued ‘must have some\n15 connection with the enforcement of the act’ to avoid making that official a mere\n16 representative of the state.”  Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 v. Del Papa, 200 F.3d 614,\n17 619 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157).  Indeed, the Nevada\n18 legislature has explicitly placed the enforcement obligations at issue in this case upon other\n19 individuals.  See, e.g., Nev. Rev. Stat. § 232.353 (stating that the Director of Health and\n20 Human Services has the obligation to adopt and enforce “each state plan required by the\n21 Federal Government, either directly or as a condition to the receipt of federal money, for the\n22 administration of any program for which the Department or any of the appropriate divisions\n23 of the Department is responsible”); see also Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180 (stating that the\n24\n25 Page 38 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 39 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Division of Child and Family Services shall plan and monitor child welfare services\n2 throughout the state); Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432A.040.  \n3 Plaintiffs do note that the Nevada Constitution obligates the Governor to enforce and\n4 uphold Nevada law.  However, a constitutional requirement to see that the laws of the state\n5 are faithfully executed is insufficient to create Ex Parte Young liability.  L.A. Branch NAACP\n6 v. L.A. Unified Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 946, 953 (9th Cir. 1983).  Further, Plaintiffs not only seek\n7 an injunction preventing the Governor from enforcing or continuing unconstitutional\n8 practices, they hope to require the Governor to take affirmative steps to eliminate the effects\n9 of the allegedly illegal conduct in this case.  However, the Governor’s powers in this area are\n10 limited to making general policy and budgetary recommendations, as well as administrative\n11 appointments.  Thus, “the purpose of joining the Governor as a defendant in this suit is not to\n12 remedy the effects of unconstitutional [practices] . . . , but to use the Governor as a surrogate\n13 for the state, and thereby evade the state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.”  Id.  Plaintiffs\n14 also appear to assert that the Governor is connected to the alleged violations because he is a\n15 supervisor.  However, as noted above, general supervisory power over those persons\n16 responsible for enforcing the challenged provision will not subject an official to suit.”  L.A.\n17 County Bar Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704 (9th Cir. 1992) (citations omitted).  Further,\n18 Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that the Governor actively participated in the\n19 alleged wrongful actions.   \n20 As analyzed above, the Governor’s general duties in this case do not establish the\n21 requisite connection between him and the unconstitutional acts that Plaintiffs allege.  Thus,\n22 the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ federal claims against Governor Gibbons.  \n23\n24\n25 Page 39 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 40 of 48(cid:10)\n1 C. Plaintiffs’ State Claims (Counts Seven and Eight)\n2 Plaintiffs allege Nevada constitutional substantive and procedural due process\n3 violations in counts seven and eight.  To support their claims, Plaintiffs cite to numerous\n4 statutory provisions.  However, the statutes to which they cite do not apply to the Governor. \n5 For example, Plaintiffs argue the Governor failed to appoint a guardian ad litem.  However,\n6 the Nevada judiciary has the sole authority to appoint a guardian ad litem.  The remaining\n7 statutes listed in subsections (b) through (e) of paragraph 286 in Plaintiffs’ Complaint refer\n8 solely to the DFS.  Of the statutes listed in subsections (f) through (i) of paragraph 286, only\n9 one statute, NRS 432A.070, refers to the Governor.  However, this statute merely references\n10 the Governor in stating that the DFS Chief must submit a budgetary report to the Governor. \n11 This statute cannot help Plaintiffs state a claim against Defendant Governor Gibbons for a\n12 violation of procedural due process under the Nevada Constitution.  Defendant Governor has\n13 never had legal or physical custody over Plaintiffs.  Further, the Governor does not have\n14 control over the agencies that have Plaintiffs in custody, nor does he control over any facility\n15 where the alleged class members have been housed, and the Governor lacks the authority or\n16 ability under Nevada statutes to affect where or how long Plaintiffs have been housed or what\n17 treatment and services they receive.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses counts seven and eight\n18 as they relate to Governor Gibbons.\n19 D. Count Nine \n20 Governor Gibbons asks the Court to dismiss count nine as it applies to him.  Plaintiffs\n21 have not named the Governor in this count.  Thus, to the extent they allege liability toward\n22 the Governor, the Court dismisses count nine as to Governor Gibbons.\n23\n24\n25 Page 40 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 41 of 48(cid:10)\n1 Pursuant to the above analysis, the Court dismisses Governor Gibbons from this\n2 action.  The Governor is immune to Plaintiffs’ federal claims, and Plaintiffs have failed to\n3 state a valid state claim against Governor Gibbons.  \n4 IV. State Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\n5 State Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims because Plaintiffs have\n6 failed to state valid claims, immunity, and because Plaintiffs have not alleged a sufficient\n7 connection between State Defendants and the alleged wrongs to support a § 1983 action.\n8 A. Section 1983 Claims \n9 State Defendants argue the Court must dismiss them from this action because\n10 Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient connections between State Defendants and the alleged\n11 wrongs to support a § 1983 action.  “To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff must\n12 show (1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of\n13 state law; and (2) that the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory\n14 right.”  Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1989).\n15 There is no question Plaintiffs have alleged Defendants were acting under the color of\n16 Nevada law when they engaged in the alleged unconstitutional conduct. Defendants argue,\n17 instead, that their conduct did not cause Plaintiffs any deprivation of their constitutional or\n18 statutory rights.  \n19 “A person ‘subjects’ another to the deprivation of a constitutional right, within the\n20 meaning of [§ ] 1983, if [that person] does an affirmative act, participates in another’s\n21 affirmative acts, or omits to perform an act which [that person] is legally required to do that\n22 causes the deprivation of which complaint is made.”  Johnson v. Duffy, 588 F.2d 740, 743\n23 (9th Cir. 1978).  In limited circumstances, a person can also be subject to § 1983 liability for\n24 the acts of others.  “Although there is no pure respondeat superior liability under § 1983, a\n25 Page 41 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 42 of 48(cid:10)\n1 supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of subordinates ‘if the supervisor\n2 participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act to prevent\n3 them.’”  Hydrick v. Hunter, 466 F.3d 676, 689 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Taylor v. List, 880\n4 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989)).  \n5 Plaintiffs proceed on a theory that Defendants created policies and procedures that\n6 violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and that Defendants were willfully blind to\n7 constitutional violations committed by their subordinates.  While Defendants argue they have\n8 no custodial control over the foster children in Clark County, Plaintiffs have alleged\n9 sufficient facts at the pleading stage to support their claim.  For example, Plaintiffs allege that\n10 Defendant Wilden oversees and supervises the Division of Child and Family Services.  See\n11 Nev. Rev. Stat. § 232.200.  Plaintiffs also argue that State Defendant Serrano has a statutory\n12 duty to “[p]lan, coordinate and monitor the delivery of child welfare services provided\n13 throughout the state . . . .”  § 432B.180(2).  Plaintiffs also allege that State Defendant\n14 Hawkins (now Doe) reviews and approves all child care facilities, licenses such facilities, and\n15 actively participates in monitoring licensed facilities.  Unlike with Governor Gibbons,\n16 Plaintiffs have cited specific statutory provisions that create direct supervisory control over\n17 subordinates actively involved in the foster care system.  On a Motion to Dismiss, the Court\n18 “presumes that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support\n19 the claim.”  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 889 (1990).  Of course State\n20 Defendants may file a motion for summary judgment after discovery has been initiated if they\n21 believe Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate material issues of fact to support their claims.  \n22 B. Failure to State a Claim and Immunity\n23 The Court analyzes these arguments in agreement with the analysis above under\n24 County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \n25 Page 42 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 43 of 48(cid:10)\n1 In sum, in regards to State Defendants’ motion to Dismiss, the Court dismisses all\n2 claims as analyzed in County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  However, the Court does not\n3 dismiss all remaining § 1983 claims because Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their claims.  \n4 V. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \n5 As noted above, Plaintiffs seek to represent a county-wide class consisting of all\n6 children “who have been, are, or will be victims in the legal custody of Clark County\n7 Department of Family Services.”  (#74 at 4.)  Plaintiffs claim the only realistic means for\n8 redressing the injuries suffered by the thousands of children who are members of the class is\n9 to prosecute this matter as a class action.  According to Plaintiffs, reliance upon any one class\n10 member’s claims will not effectively remedy the class-wide issues raised in this suit.\n11 Plaintiffs seek to prosecute their suit as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of\n12 Civil Procedure 23.  Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating they meet Rule 23’s\n13 requirements.  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001)\n14 (citation omitted).  District courts have broad discretion in deciding whether or not to certify\n15 a class.  Id. (citing Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1309 (9th Cir. 1977).  As\n16 discussed below, the Court refrains at this time from ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion until the\n17 parties have had the opportunity to conduct discovery relating to the proposed class.\n18 A. Rule 23 Factors\n19 To obtain class certification, Plaintiffs must first satisfy the numerosity, commonality,\n20 typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements of Rule 23(a).  Walters v. Reno, 145\n21 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir. 1998).  “These requirements effectively ‘limit the class claims to\n22 those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff's claims’” by ensuring that the named\n23 plaintiffs have suffered the same injury and possess the same interest as the other class\n24 members.  Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982).  Plaintiffs must then\n25 Page 43 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 44 of 48(cid:10)\n1 demonstrate that their claims fall under one of the categories listed in Rule 23(b).  Because\n2 Plaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), they must demonstrate Defendants\n3 have “acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\n4 appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class\n5 as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “Before certifying a class, the trial court must conduct\n6 a ‘rigorous analysis’ to determine whether the party seeking certification has met the\n7 prerequisites of Rule 23.  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186 (quoting Valentino v. Carter-Wallace,\n8 Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1233 (9th Cir. 1996)).\n9 1. Numerosity \n10 A proposed class meets the numerosity requirement if “the class is so numerous that\n11 joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Plaintiffs satisfy the\n12 numerosity requirement.  Rule 23 does not require that class actions involve any specific\n13 number of putative class members.  Jordan v. County of L.A., 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir.\n14 1982).  Although Courts should consider many factors, the proposed class’ absolute size is\n15 the most important factor.  Id.  Plaintiffs allege that the proposed class numbers at least\n16 4,000.  While some courts have held that the plaintiffs must present the actual number, most\n17 courts have held that a reasonable estimate is sufficient.  See, e.g., Zeidman v. J. Ray\n18 McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981).  Defendants argue that\n19 Plaintiffs have not cited to a reliable number.  However, Plaintiffs use the very numbers that\n20 Defendants have determined are in the Clark County foster system.  Further, courts may rely\n21 on common-sense assumptions to support findings of numerosity.  Sherman v. Griepentrog,\n22 775 F. Supp. 1383, 1389 (D. Nev. 1991).  Further, if joinder of all class members and their\n23 claims in one proceeding would be expensive, time-consuming, and logistically unfeasible,\n24 then the class size is sufficiently numerous that joinder is impracticable.  The putative class is\n25 Page 44 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 45 of 48(cid:10)\n1 made up of thousands of children, many of which certainly cannot afford legal representation. \n2 Accordingly, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the class is so numerous that joinder of all\n3 members is impracticable.  \n4 B. Commonality and Typicality \n5 The second requirement of Rule 23(a) is that “there are questions of law or fact\n6 common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  To satisfy the third requirement, Plaintiffs\n7 must establish that the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the\n8 claims or defenses of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The Ninth Circuit has noted that the\n9 commonality and typicality inquiry under Rule 23(a), and the availability of Rule 23(b)(2)\n10 class certification, frequently overlap when plaintiffs seek class certification based on the\n11 existence of a common policy or practice allegedly applicable to the class as a whole. \n12 Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045-47 (9th Cir. 1998). \n13 To determine commonality, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that at least one alleged\n14 statutory constitutional violation applies to all Plaintiffs and putative class members. \n15 Plaintiffs have opted to file their Motion for Certification before any discovery has been\n16 conducted and before the Court decides any dispositive motions.  Courts have held that\n17 generally it is better to conduct some pre-certification discovery and make rulings on early\n18 dispositive motions before reaching class certification.  See, e.g., Hickey v. Seattle, No. C00-\n19 1672 MJP 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36400, at *10 (June 5, 2006 W.D. Wash. 2006) (citing\n20 Federal Judicial Ctr., Manual for Complex Litigation 253 (4th ed. 2004)).  In a case such as\n21 this one, the Court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” and examine all claims as against all\n22 parties to ensure that not only is there at least one common alleged statutory violation among\n23 all class members, but that all the claims are typical of one another for the entire class. \n24 However, as analyzed above, the Court dismisses many of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Therefore,\n25 Page 45 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 46 of 48(cid:10)\n1 questions could potentially arise whether the class as a whole could demonstrate\n2 commonality and typicality after the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ claims.  In addition, because\n3 “motions for class certification are fact-specific, and therefore, the outcome of these motions\n4 will vary based on the specific facts of the case,” a careful analysis of class certification\n5 issues may not be possible where the factual record is undeveloped.  Stevens v. Harper, 213\n6 F.R.D. 358, 378 (E.D. Cal. Sep. 10 2003) (citing McReynolds v. Sodexho Marriott Services,\n7 Inc., 208 F.R.D. 428, 442 (D.D.C. 2002)). \n8 In this case, Plaintiffs controlled the timing of their certification motion by bringing\n9 the motion before the parties could develop the factual record through discovery, and before\n10 their claims had been refined by dispositive motions.  Plaintiffs may not obtain class\n11 certification based solely on allegations of system-wide violations, especially when they rely\n12 on such allegations not only to establish commonality and typicality under Rule 23(a), but\n13 also to demonstrate the propriety of class certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Generalized\n14 policy and practice allegations do not substitute for the kind of specific legal and factual\n15 showings required by Rule 23.  See J.B. v Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1289 (10th Cir. 1999)\n16 (refusing to “read an allegation of systematic failures as a moniker for meeting the class\n17 action requirements”); Gen. Tel. Co. v.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 (1982) (stating that a\n18 general allegation that the defendant has a practice of harmful conduct is insufficient under\n19 Rule 23).  \n20 In addition to their “systematic” theory of commonality, Plaintiffs allege that all\n21 putative class members suffer, or will suffer, specific violations of the Medicaid Act, the\n22 Adoption Assistance Act, and the Child Abuse Act.  However, as discussed above, Plaintiffs\n23 may not bring a private cause of action under all the statutory provisions cited.  Thus, the\n24 Court chooses to first decide the pending dispositive motions and then conduct the necessary\n25 Page 46 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 47 of 48(cid:10)\n1 “rigorous analysis” to determine if the remaining allegations provide commonality and\n2 typicality.  After deciding the pending dispositive motions, it is very possible that\n3 commonality and typicality may no longer exist (assuming it does at this moment). Therefore,\n4 the Court defers ruling on class certification until the record is further developed and the\n5 parties have an opportunity to conduct discovery specific to the proposed class.  Valentino v.\n6 Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1233 (9th Cir. 1996); Stevens v. Harper, 213 F.R.D. 358,\n7 378 (E.D. Cal. Sep. 10 2003) (citing McReynolds v. Sodexho Marriott Services, Inc., 208\n8 F.R.D. 428, 442 (D.D.C. 2002)).  Accordingly, the Court defers ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion\n9 at this time.\n10 CONCLUSION\n11 Pursuant to the above analysis, the Court rules on the pending motions as follows:\n12 As to all Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, the Court DENIES without prejudice all Motions\n13 as they relate to mootness and DENIES with prejudice all Motions as they relate to standing.\n14 First, as to County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court GRANTS Defendants’\n15 request to dismiss Defendant DFS from this action and DENIES Defendants’ request to\n16 dismiss the individually-named County Commissioners as analyzed above.  The Court further\n17 GRANTS Defendants’ Motion and dismisses the following claims in accordance with the\n18 above analysis: (1) Plaintiffs’ claims under the Federal Adoption Assistance Act under 42\n19 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10), 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22), 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) and 675(5)(A),\n20 and Plaintiffs’ “All-Other-Rights claim”; (2) all Plaintiffs’ claims under the Medicaid Act;\n21 (3) Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claims under the U.S. Constitution for any Plaintiffs\n22 voluntarily in state custody; (4) Plaintiffs substantive due process claims under the U.S.\n23 Constitution as to all Plaintiffs based on a right not to be retained in custody longer than is\n24 necessary or to be placed in the least restrictive placement based on the foster child’s needs;\n25 Page 47 of  48\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ     Document 134     Filed 05/14/2007     Page 48 of 48(cid:10)\n1 (5) Plaintiffs’ claim for state-created danger; and (6) counts seven through nine inasmuch as\n2 they allege liability for the manner in which Defendants carried out the alleged duties\n3 underlying the state claims.  The Court HEREBY DENIES County Defendants Motion to\n4 Dismiss with regards to Plaintiffs claims under the Federal Adoption Assistance Act under 42\n5 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1), and 675(5)(B)–the Right to Timely Written Case plans, and 42\n6 U.S.C. §§ 675(5)(D) and 622(b)(10)(B)(ii)–the Right to Health and Educational Records\n7 Reviewed, and 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(G)–the Right of Foster Parents or Preadoptive Parents to\n8 Notice of Hearings.  The Court further DENIES Defendants’ Motion as it relates to (1)\n9 Plaintiffs’ claim under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n10 § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii), (2) Plaintiffs’ substantive and procedural due process claims as\n11 analyzed above, (3) Plaintiffs’ tenth cause of action, without prejudice to the filing of a\n12 motion for summary judgment, and (4) counts seven through nine inasmuch as they relate to\n13 allegations that Defendants failed to even initiate (not the manner in which the Defendants\n14 performed) the statutory duties as discussed in the Order above.  Further, the Court defers\n15 ruling on Defendants’ abstention argument pursuant to Younger.  \n16 As to Governor Gibbons’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court GRANTS Governor\n17 Gibbons’s Motion to Dismiss and dismisses the Governor from this action for the reasons\n18 stated above in this Order.  \n19 As to the State Defendants, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART\n20 State Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as discussed above. \n  \n21 DATED: May 9, 2007.\n22\n                                                                     \n23       ROBERT C.

(#136.)  Defendants Clark County, Virginia Valentine, Tom Morton, Louis Palma,\n16\nBruce L. Woodbury, Tom Collins, Chip Maxfield, Yvonne Atkinson Gates, Myrna Williams,\n17\nLynette Boggs McDonald, and Rory Reid (collectively “County Defendants”) have also filed a\n18\nlimited Motion for Joinder (#140) as to Plaintiffs’ due process claim based on the Interstate\n19\nCompact on the Placement of Children, and Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract.  The Court\n20\nhas considered the Motions, the pleadings on file, and oral argument on behalf of all parties and\n21\nhereby issues the following Order.\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 2 of 10\n1 BACKGROUND \n2 In August 2006, Plaintiffs1 filed suit on behalf of themselves and “all abused and\n3 neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care system.”  (#57-\n4 1 at 6.)  Plaintiffs originally filed this civil action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Kenny C.\n5 Guinn, as Nevada Governor, Michael Willden (Director of Nevada Health and Human Services),\n6 Fernando Serrano (Administrator of the Nevada Division of Child and Family Services), John\n7 Doe (Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Services for Child Care of the Division of Child and Family\n8 Services), Virginia Valentine (Clark County Manager), Clark County Department of Family\n9 Services, Tom Morton (Director of Clark County Department of Family Services), Louis Palma\n10 (Manager of Shelter Care for the Clark County Department of Family Services), County\n11 Commissioners Bruce L. Woodbury, Tom Collins, Chip Maxfield, Yvonne Atkinson Gates,\n12 Myrna Williams, Lynette Boggs McDonald, and Rory Reid, and finally Clark County itself.  In\n13 their Complaint, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the operation of\n14 Nevada’s and Clark County’s foster care system.\n15 On May 14, 2007, this Court issued a lengthy order in which it dismissed the Governor\n16 completely from this action.  The Court further dismissed some of Plaintiff’s claims for failure\n17 to state a claim.  The remaining Defendants have now filed their Motion to Partially Dismiss\n18 Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim.  \n19\n20\n21\n22\n1 Plaintiffs proceed under fictitious names pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a).  The named Plaintiffs\ninclude Clark K. (by his next friend Sherry Anderson), Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. (collectively the “A\n23\nPlaintiffs”) (by their next friend Tarrah Logan), Toni Summer and Frank B. (collectively the “B Plaintiffs”) (by their\nnext friend Marilyn Paikai), and Donna C. (by her next friend Jacquelyn Romero).\n24\n25 Page 2 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 3 of 10\n1 DISCUSSION \n2 I. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \n3 Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ third (§1983 action based on\n4 procedural due process), seventh (procedural due process violation based on the Nevada\n5 Constitution), and tenth (breach of contract) causes of action.  Defendants argue that\n6 Plaintiffs have failed to state valid claims under these causes of action.  Specifically,\n7 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs substantive due process claims fail because Plaintiffs cannot\n8 demonstrate a valid state created liberty interest, and even if they could, the law already\n9 provides sufficient due process to address Plaintiffs’ complaints.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to\n10 deny Defendants’ Motion because it is not properly before the Court, and because Plaintiffs\n11 have stated claims upon which the Court may grant relief.\n12 A. Standard of Review \n13 Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, dismissal is appropriate if\n14 the plaintiff “fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Dismissal for failure to\n15 state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper only if it is beyond doubt the plaintiff can prove no\n16 set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Williamson v. Gen.\n17 Dynamics Corp., 208 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 2000).  The review is limited to the complaint,\n18 and all allegations of material fact are taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the\n19 plaintiff.  In re Stac Elecs. Sec. Litig., 89 F.3d 1399, 1403 (9th Cir. 1996).  Although courts\n20 assume the factual allegations to be true, courts should not “assume the truth of legal conclusions\n21 merely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.”  W. Mining Council v. Watt, 643\n22 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981).\n23   On a motion to dismiss, the court “presumes that general allegations embrace those\n24 specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.”  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S.\n25 Page 3 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 4 of 10\n1 871, 889 (1990).  However, conclusory allegations and unwarranted inferences are insufficient\n2 to defeat a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  In re Stac Elecs., 89 F.3d at 1403.  If either\n3 party submits materials outside of the pleadings in support or in opposition to the motion to\n4 dismiss, and the district court relies on these materials, the motion may be treated as one for\n5 summary judgment.  Anderson v. Angelone, 86 F.3d 932, 934 (9th Cir. 1996).\n6 B. Plaintiffs’ Estoppel Argument \n7 Plaintiffs first contend that Defendants’ latest Motion to Dismiss fails to address any new\n8 issues of fact or law, and thus the Court should deny the Motion pursuant to Federal Rule of\n9 Civil Procedure 12(g).  Rule 12(g) states:\n10 If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or\nobjection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by\n11 motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or\nobjection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) hereof on\n12 any of the grounds there stated.\n13 Rule 12(h)(2), in turn, states:\n14 A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense\nof failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and an objection of failure\n15 to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted or\nordered under Rule 7(a) [governing answers and counterclaims], or by motion for\n16 judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.\n17 Therefore, a party who makes a motion under Rule 12 is precluded from raising a similar\n18 objection omitted in the first motion unless the motion is based upon a ground set forth in\n19 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(2).  Rule 12(h)(2) includes a motion to dismiss for failure\n20 to state a claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(2).  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is\n21 properly before the court.  Moreover, there is no appearance of bad faith on part of Defendants.\n22 Accordingly, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ estoppel argument.\n23\n24\n25 Page 4 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 5 of 10\n1 C. Counts Three and Seven—Plaintiffs’ § 1983 Procedural Due Process Claim\n2 Plaintiffs allege that their federal and state constitutional due process rights were violated\n3 when Defendants failed to enforce various Nevada statutes providing for Plaintiffs’ welfare.  For\n4 the reasons stated below, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ claims and grants Defendants’ Motion to\n5 Dismiss.  \n6 To prevail on a § 1983 claim based on a procedural due process violation, a plaintiff must\n7 establish the following: (1) a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest; (2) a\n8 deprivation of that interest by the government; and (3) the lack of process.  Portman v. County\n9 of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  Only if Plaintiffs demonstrate the existence\n10 of all three elements may the Court entertain their claim.  \n11 1. Constitutionally Protected Interest \n12 The Court begins its analysis by examining whether Plaintiffs have any protected\n13 interests.  Only if the Court finds a constitutionally protected interest must it ask whether the\n14 alleged deprivation was accompanied by appropriate due process.  Ky. Dep’t of Corrs. v.\n15 Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989).  The Supreme Court has specifically declined to address\n16 whether state child welfare statutes give children an entitlement to protective services “which\n17 would enjoy due process protection against state deprivation . . . .”  DeShaney v. Winnebago\n18 County Dep’t of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 n.2 (1989).  Further, as both Defendants and\n19 Plaintiffs recognize, the Ninth Circuit has not addressed this issue.  \n20 Although the Ninth Circuit has not specifically addressed the issue, it has held that a state\n21 law must satisfy two requirements in order to create a liberty interest protected by the\n22 Constitution.  “First, the law must set forth substantive predicates to govern official decision\n23 making and, second, it must contain explicitly mandatory language, i.e., a specific directive to\n24 the decision maker that mandates a particular outcome if the substantive predicates have been\n25 Page 5 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 6 of 10\n1 met.”  Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1044 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal citations and\n2 quotations omitted).  The Supreme Court also has stated that a “‘state creates a protected liberty\n3 interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion.’” Campbell v. Burt, 141 F.3d\n4 927, 930 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983)).  A state\n5 substantively limits official discretion “by establishing ‘substantive predicates’ to govern official\n6 decision making . . . and, further by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the\n7 relevant criteria have been met.”  Ky. Dep’t of Corrs., 490 U.S. at 462.  Further, the Court cannot\n8 elevate a state-mandated procedure to a constitutionally protected interest solely because the state\n9 procedure is couched in mandatory terms, since obligatory governmental actions can serve\n10 various legitimate ends other than conferring a constitutionally protected interest upon an\n11 individual.  See Olim, 461 U.S. at 250-51; see also Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S.\n12 748, 764-65 (2005).  \n13 The statutes and regulations at issue in this case do not confer constitutionally protected\n14 interests on the Plaintiffs.  While the provisions at issue, which deal with appointment of a\n15 guardian ad litem, child abuse investigation, placement of and services to foster children, foster\n16 care licensing, child care facility licensing, and the Interstate Compact on the Placement of\n17 Children, set forth the requirements that state and local officials must undertake, they do not,\n18 standing alone, create independent substantive entitlements whose deprivation would trigger the\n19 Due Process Clause.  See Sealed v. Sealed, 332 F.3d 51, 57 (2nd Cir. 2003); see also Doe v.\n20 D.C., 93 F.3d 861, 867-68 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding that the codification of procedures for child\n21 abuse and neglect reports did not indicate that the agencies responsible for carrying out the\n22 statutorily created procedural rights assumed constitutional obligations to protect children from\n23 abuse); Weller v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 901 F.2d 387, 392 (4th Cir. 1990); Charlie H. v. Whitman,\n24 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 509-13 (D. N.J. 2000) (rejecting similar due process claims).  While some\n25 Page 6 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 7 of 10\n1 of the statutory provisions at issue use mandatory language such as “shall”, these provisions do\n2 not set forth substantive predicates to govern official decision making or mandate the outcome\n3 to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met—requirements that must\n4 be met to establish a protected interest.  See Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1044 (9th Cir.\n5 2002); Ky. Dep’t of Corrs., 490 U.S. at 461-63.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have admitted that many\n6 of the statutes at issue do not even apply to the State Defendants.  For example, Nev. Admin.\n7 Code § 432B.405, which requires an assessment of foster children’s safety before returning them\n8 to their parents’ custody, applies to the Clark County Department of Child and family Services,\n9 not the State Defendants.\n10 Simply put, while some of the statutes to which Plaintiffs look contain mandatory words\n11 such as must or shall, these provisions do not give rise to constitutionally protected interests.\n12 These provisions neither limit Defendants’ discretion nor provide the outcome to be reached\n13 upon a finding of a violation.  Moreover, even if the Court were to find a constitutionally\n14 protected interest, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the process already provided by the state court\n15 system is insufficient.  Likewise, Plaintiffs fail to provide or allege what additional process\n16 should be afforded Plaintiffs.  For the reasons stated above and at oral argument, the Court grants\n17 State Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as it relates to Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims in\n18 counts three and seven.\n19 D. Breach of Contract \n20 Plaintiffs also assert a breach of contract claim for breach of the state Plans.  Under the\n21 Adoption and Assistance and Child Welfare Act (the “Act”), a state may obtain federal funding\n22 provided it complies with certain federal guidelines as set out in the Act.  If a state chooses to\n23 seek federal funding, it must obtain federal approval of its plan.  Plaintiffs assert that as a result\n24 of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiffs, as third-party beneficiaries to the Adoption\n25 Page 7 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 8 of 10\n1 Assistance Act and other federal regulations under which they bring their federal claims, are\n2 being denied their rights under the federal common law to the services and benefits that Nevada\n3 is contractually obligated to provide.  Defendants contend first that these plans are not contracts\n4 and, even if they were, Plaintiffs are not intended third-party beneficiaries.  Plaintiffs also claim\n5 that the Court may not entertain this request to dismiss because the Court previously refused to\n6 dismiss the claim and indicated it could be heard at summary judgment. \n7 1. Prior Order \n8 First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ Motion is improper because the Court has already\n9 considered Defendants’ arguments, and because Defendants failed to move for dismissal in their\n10 prior Motion to Dismiss.  As discussed above, Defendants are not barred from filing another\n11 Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim.  In addition, the Court never ruled on this issue.\n12 In its prior Order, the Court simply said it could not make any decision on Plaintiffs’ claim for\n13 breach of contract because Plaintiffs failed to include or discuss the actual contract the Court was\n14 to consider.  Plaintiffs subsequently amended their Complaint and provided the detail and the\n15 alleged contract to this Court.  Thus, the Court now considers Defendants’ argument.  \n16 2. Valid Contract?\n17 Plaintiffs have failed to provide any support for the proposition that Nevada’s state plan\n18 formulated under the Adoption Assistance Act or CAPTA, and approved by the Secretary of\n19 Health and Human Services pursuant to the federal statutes, constitutes a contract.  This question\n20 is an issue of first impression in the Ninth Circuit.  Only one other federal court has considered\n21 whether state plans promulgated to comply with the federal statutes at issue in this case\n22 constitute a valid contract.  See Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476 (D. N.J. 2000).  In\n23 Charlie H., the court held that state plans such as those at issue in this case did not constitute a\n24 binding contract.  The Court noted that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate the state of New\n25 Page 8 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 9 of 10\n1 Jersey could be sued by any entity for New Jersey’s alleged failure to comply with its\n2 “contractual” obligations.  Here, Plaintiffs also fail to provide similar evidence or allegation.  For\n3 example, the other party to this alleged contract is the United States.  The federal statutes\n4 governing this relationship do not indicate that the United States may sue Nevada for failing to\n5 abide by the federal statutes.  If Nevada fails to comply, it simply loses federal funding.  Thus,\n6 Nevada’s obligations under the state plans are voluntary.  Moreover, many of the breaches for\n7 which Plaintiffs seek relief are based on alleged contractual obligations stemming from statutory\n8 provisions for which this Court has already held that Plaintiffs have no private cause of action.\n9 Thus, Plaintiffs are attempting to circumvent this Court’s prior Order by seeking relief, for\n10 breach of contract, under statutory provisions for which no private cause of action is provided.\n11 Plaintiffs cite several cases to support their view that they are third-party beneficiaries\n12 under the state plans.  Indeed, while Plaintiffs provide ample support to show they may be third-\n13 party beneficiaries, they fail to provide any case establishing a contract in the first place.  As both\n14 parties note in their pleadings, the cases submitted by Plaintiffs do not deal with the statutes at\n15 issue.  The only federal case addressing these federal statutes, although not binding on this Court,\n16 refused to find a contract.  This Court has already ruled that Plaintiffs may seek a private cause\n17 of action on many of these alleged statutory violations, as delineated in its prior order.  The Court\n18 has also dismissed many of Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of a private cause of action.  Plaintiffs may\n19 not seek double recovery or circumvent this Court’s prior rulings by an action for breach of\n20 contract.  The Court therefore grants Defendants’ request to dismiss Plaintiffs’ tenth cause of\n21 action for breach of contract.    \n22 CONCLUSION \n23 For the reasons stated above and at oral argument, the Court grants State Defendants’\n24 Motion to Partially Dismiss Amended Complaint.  The Court further grants County\n25 Page 9 of  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 161   Filed 09/04/07   Page 10 of 10\n1 Defendants’ Motion for Joinder.

He is responsible for the administration and oversight of all functions of State \n10  DCFS.  State DCFS administers all federal funds granted to the State for child welfare services; it \n11  must adopt regulations establishing uniform standards for child welfare services provided by the \n12  counties and is charged with monitoring the delivery of all child welfare services by Clark and \n13  Washoe Counties.  His business address is 711 East 5th Street, Carson City, NV 89701. \n14  9.

Their \n3  business address is 500 Grand Central Parkway, Las Vegas, Nevada 89106. \n4  11.  Defendant Clark County is subject to the jurisdiction of this court.  With the \n5  passage of Assembly Bill 1 in 2001, for counties with a population over 100,000, responsibility \n6  for the funding and provision of child welfare and child protective services in that county was \n7  transferred from State DCFS to the county agency.  Clark County has a population of over \n8  100,000, and is responsible for providing funding in an amount set by the County for the \n9  provision of child welfare services. Clark County has created a political department, Clark \n10  County DFS, to provide and administer child welfare services in the County.  \n11  12.  Defendant Virginia Valentine is the Clark County Manager, and is sued in her \n12  official capacity.  She is responsible for managing the County’s $5 billion budget and providing \n13  administrative oversight for all County departments, including Clark County DFS.  Her business \n14  address is 500 S. Grand Central Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89155. \n15  13.  Defendant Tom Morton is the Director of Clark County DFS, and is sued in his \n16  official capacity.  He is the executive officer of Clark County DFS, and is responsible for \n17  administering child welfare services in Clark County and for ensuring the safety and well-being \n18  of children in or at risk of entering the child welfare system, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n19  § 432B.  His business address is 701 N. Pecos Rd., Bldg. K, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101. \n20  14.  Defendant Louis Palma is the Manager of Shelter Care for Clark County DFS, and \n21  is sued in his official capacity.  He is responsible for oversight of all shelter care facilities and \n22  programs in Clark County, which includes the day-to-day operations of Child Haven.  His \n23  business address is 701 N. Pecos Rd., Las Vegas, Nevada 89101. \n24  III. \n \n25  INTRODUCTION \n26  15.  This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought by ten children on behalf of all \n27  abused and neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care \n28  system.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel Nevada and Clark County \n  - 5 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 6 of 73\n \n1  officials to meet their legal duties under federal and state law to protect and care for abused and \n2  neglected children. \n3  16.  During 2004, there were 8,979 investigations of child abuse or neglect reports in \n4  Clark County.  During the same year, 4,548 children entered foster care.  There are currently over \n5  3,600 children in the legal custody of Clark County placed in foster family homes, group homes, \n6  unlicensed and/or unpaid relative homes, and other settings. \n7  17.  Until 2004, Nevada operated a bifurcated child welfare system in which the state’s \n8  two counties with populations of over 100,000 – Clark and Washoe Counties – were responsible \n9  for providing child protective services, while the State bore responsibility for providing foster \n10  care services.  As a result of AB 1, passed by the Nevada State Legislature in 2001, responsibility \n11  for both child protective services and foster care were vested with Clark and Washoe Counties.  \n12  The State retained responsibility for supervision and oversight of Clark and Washoe Counties’ \n13  programs to ensure, among other things, compliance with federal and state laws, regulations, and \n14  standards.  The transfer of foster care staff and services from the State to Clark County was \n15  completed in October 2004. \n16  18.  Clark County’s child welfare system is in crisis.  Virtually every aspect of the \n17  County’s child protective services and foster care system is failing the children and youth it is \n18  charged with protecting.  The County’s child welfare system denies children their rights under the \n19  Federal and State Constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, and accepted professional standards. \n20  19.  The County and State’s failures have resulted in harm to an untold number of \n21  children.  A recent state report indicates that within the last four years at least 79 children have \n22  died from abuse or neglect.  These victims of fatal injuries or neglect include children in foster \n23  care and children left at home following a substantiated report of abuse.  Many of their deaths \n24  were preventable. \n25  20.  Within the past two and a half years, one study after another has documented Clark \n26  County’s failure to protect the health, safety, and well-being of child abuse victims and children \n27  in foster care.  Defendants have had full knowledge of these studies, and have nonetheless failed \n28 \n  - 6 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 7 of 73\n \n1  to take adequate steps to address the long-standing problems identified in them.  These studies \n2  include: \n3  A December 2003 Statewide Assessment of child welfare services conducted as \n• \n4  part of the preparation for the February 2004 federal Child and Family Services \n5  Review (“CFSR”); \n6  A February 2004 federal CFSR of Nevada’s child welfare system that included an \n• \n7  audit of Clark County’s system (“2004 Federal Review”); \n8  An April 2004 Audit of Child Haven and the Clark County Shelter Home Program \n• \n9  conducted by the Audit Department of Clark County; \n10  An April 2005 Report to the Clark County Commissioners on the Status of Child \n• \n11  Welfare Services; \n12  A June 2005 report of a review of child abuse fatalities in Clark County conducted \n• \n13  by the Child Welfare Institute of which Defendant Morton was the former director; \n14  An October 2005 case review of Clark County child abuse and foster care cases \n• \n15  conducted by State DCFS (“2005 County Case Review”); and \n16  An April 2006 Report of the Findings and Recommendations: Child Deaths 2001-\n• \n17  2004 describing the results of an independent child death review panel \n18  investigation of deaths related to child abuse or neglect in Clark County (“2006 \n19  Child Fatality Report”). \n20  21.  During July 2006, representatives of the Administration for Children and Families \n21  of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“Federal DHHS”) conducted a \n22  site visit to reassess Clark County’s child welfare program.  Federal officials concluded that the \n23  situation for children and families served by Clark County’s child welfare system “has worsened” \n24  since officials’ earlier on-site visit in February 2004.  Some of the specific deficiencies reported \n25  by federal officials include: \n26  The State’s acquiescence in Clark County’s continued use of an unlicensed \n• \n27  congregate care facility – Child Haven; \n28  Consistent overcrowding at Child Haven; \n• \n  - 7 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 8 of 73\n \n1  Unnecessary removal of children from their homes due to Clark County’s failure \n• \n2  to provide an adequate array of services to prevent placement; \n3  Frequent changes in placement of children in foster care; \n• \n4  Inadequate assessments of the safety of suspected victims of child abuse and \n• \n5  neglect; \n6  Inadequate training of staff and insufficient recruitment of foster parents; \n• \n7  Unanswered or lengthy delays in answering calls to the Child Abuse Hotline; \n• \n8  The use of an invalid, ineffective risk assessment tool; \n• \n9  The failure to use data to provide effective oversight and supervision; and \n• \n10  The failure to provide a guardian ad litem for every child in foster care. \n• \n11  22.  In a letter to Nevada child welfare officials on August 11, 2006, Sharon M. Fujii, \n12  the Regional Administrator for the Administration for Children and Families of Federal DHHS, \n13  informed Nevada that “the manner in which the continuum of child welfare services is managed \n14  in Clark County should be a grave concern to the State.”  August 11, 2006 Letter from Sharon M. \n15  Fujii to Defendant Willden.  She notified state officials that the current Program Improvement \n16  Plan between the State and federal officials “is no longer adequate to address the serious \n17  deficiencies in the State’s child welfare program, most specifically Clark County which accounts \n18  for the majority of the State’s child welfare population.”  Id.  \n19  23.  Defendants Willden and Serrano subsequently wrote a letter to Defendant Morton \n20  warning him that:  \n21  we continue to receive information indicating serious deficiencies \nwith the [child welfare] system …; the existing level of effort to \n22  correct system deficiencies is not adequate; [and] that despite lists \nof corrective action plans … still we have major failures. \n23 \n24  August 30, 2006 Letter from Defendants Willden and Serrano to Defendant Morton. \n25  24.  For years, Clark County has evaded scrutiny of its child protective services and \n26  foster care programs.  It has hidden behind a veil of confidentiality meant to protect children and \n27  families, but which the County has used to shield itself from oversight and criticism. \n28 \n  - 8 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 9 of 73\n \n1  25.  Among other things, it has failed and continues to fail to comply with federal law \n2  requiring that it provide the public with findings and information concerning child abuse victims \n3  who have died or suffered near fatalities.  The little information available to the public about the \n4  child welfare system is incomplete and out of date.  The most recent data on child abuse and \n5  foster care is from 2004. \n6  26.  Nevada and its counties receive millions of dollars in federal funds to meet the \n7  needs of children in the child welfare system and are therefore required to comply with federal \n8  mandates, including those set forth in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the Child \n9  Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment \n10  provisions of Medicaid law.  In state fiscal year 2004, Nevada spent over $79 million on child \n11  welfare services, of which $44 million was federal funds. \n12  27.  This lawsuit also challenges the placement of children, and the conditions in which \n13  they are forced to live, at Child Haven – an unlicensed child care institution operated by Clark \n14  County.  For years, Child Haven has not been a safe “haven” for the children and youth placed \n15  there.  Upon entering foster care in Clark County, children are placed at Child Haven and remain \n16  there for as little as a few hours or as long as a year or more.  For years, unlike other facilities \n17  providing care to foster children in Nevada, Child Haven has been allowed to operate without \n18  meeting the minimum licensing standards required by state law.  The Child Haven facility houses \n19  infants and young children alongside teenagers, some of whom have significant behavioral \n20  problems and pose a risk of serious harm to the younger, more vulnerable children in the facility.  \n21  Child Haven is frequently extremely overcrowded resulting in children sleeping on the floors and \n22  in gymnasiums, separated from their siblings and in conditions that have contributed to the spread \n23  of infectious disease at Child Haven.  Children’s needs, particularly their need for mental health \n24  care, are not being met. \n25  28.  High caseloads and inadequate training of Clark County child protective services \n26  and foster care workers contribute to the crisis within the system.  Many workers’ caseloads \n27  exceed those established by national standards.  Workers are ill prepared and supervised to \n28 \n  - 9 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 10 of 73\n \n1  perform a job in which failure to abide by law, regulations, and professional standards, and failure \n2  to exercise professional judgment result in serious injury to or death of a child. \n3  29.  Investigations of child abuse reports – both those involving children in foster care \n4  and those left at home – routinely fail to comply with state law and professional standards.  As a \n5  direct result, children who could and should have been protected suffer unnecessarily. \n6  30.  Clark County DFS has failed to recruit and retain a sufficient number of foster \n7  homes, resulting in harm to children whose needs are mismatched with the foster parents’ \n8  experience and abilities.  Placements are often made based solely upon whether or not there is an \n9  available bed in the foster home.  As a result, placements often break down, and children are \n10  shuttled from one house, group home, and institution to another.  Caseworkers fail to visit \n11  children in these placements, and, as a result, are unaware of the quality of care the child is \n12  receiving, the harm befalling the child, the risk to which the child is exposed, and the lack of \n13  needed services. \n14  31.  Children in foster homes recruited, licensed, and supervised by Defendants are \n15  subjected to abuse and neglect in those homes.  When there are complaints about foster homes, \n16  Clark County DFS often turns a deaf ear, allowing children to remain in dangerous homes that \n17  either should not have been licensed in the first place or should have had their license revoked.  \n18  At the same time, Clark County DFS retaliates against foster parents who advocate for services \n19  for a child placed in their homes or who disagree with the department’s plan for the child, driving \n20  out the very foster parents the system needs.  Clark County DFS also fails to provide foster \n21  parents with even the most basic background information about children they place in their homes \n22  and the supportive services needed. \n23  32.  Children entering foster care have many special needs – for medical and mental \n24  health care as well as educational and special educational services.  Clark County DFS fails to act \n25  as a responsible parent to children in its custody.  As a result, foster children’s needs are not met \n26  and services are delayed or not provided at all, causing substantial harm to these children. \n27  33.  Children in foster care have no voice in the court proceedings where decisions are \n28  made that affect their basic safety, their temporary and permanent placement, and their general \n  - 10 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 11 of 73\n \n1  well-being.  Even though state and federal law mandate appointment of a representative to look \n2  out for the interests of the child in all cases, Clark County falls woefully short of meeting this \n3  requirement. \n4  34.  If Defendants’ unconstitutional and unlawful actions and omissions are not halted, \n5  many more children will be harmed.  Another generation of children entrusted to the County and \n6  State will suffer untold misery, some will die, and others will leave the foster care system ill \n7  prepared to live healthy, independent, and productive lives. \n8  IV. \n \n9  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10  35.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n11  23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs represent a countywide class of children who have been, are, or will be \n12  victims of child abuse and neglect and have been, are, or will be in the legal custody of Clark \n13  County DFS. \n14  36.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are met in that the class is so numerous that \n15  joinder of all members is impracticable.  Furthermore, the class is fluid in that new members are \n16  regularly created.  There are over 3,600 children in foster care in Clark County.  Throughout the \n17  year, many more children enter care than is reflected in any single day census.  During 2004, for \n18  example, a total of 4,548 were removed from their homes and placed in foster care. \n19  37.  All the members share common issues of law and fact.  All of the plaintiffs and \n20  class members are in need of adequate child welfare services, must rely on Clark County and \n21  State DCFS Defendants for those services, and are harmed by Defendants’ systemic failure to \n22  fulfill their legal obligations to provide safe care, adequate treatment, and necessary services.  \n23  Questions of law and fact common to the class of plaintiffs predominate over any individual \n24  issues of law and fact. \n25  38.  Specific common questions of fact include, but are not limited to, \n26  (a)  Whether class members are placed at an overcrowded, unlicensed \n27  congregate facility that fails to meet their needs; \n28 \n  - 11 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 12 of 73\n \n1  (b)  Whether class members are left in dangerous situations due to Defendants’ \n2  failure to conduct timely investigations of reports of abuse and neglect; \n3  (c)  Whether Defendants fail to recruit and support an adequate array of foster \n4  placements to meet the needs of class members; \n5  (d)  Whether class members are placed in homes and other facilities in which \n6  they have been harmed or are at risk of harm; \n7  (e)  Whether class members are deprived of needed medical, mental health, and \n8  dental care services; \n9  (f)  Whether class members are provided with appropriate educational services; \n10  and \n11  (g)  Whether class members are represented by a guardian ad litem in abuse \n12  and neglect proceedings in the Clark County District Court. \n13  39.  Specific common questions of law include, but are not limited to, \n14  (a)  Whether upon entry into foster care class members’ placement in Child \n15  Haven, an unlicensed child care facility, violates Nevada and federal laws; \n16  (b)  Whether the failure to conduct timely investigations of complaints of child \n17  abuse or neglect involving class members violates their rights under \n18  Nevada and federal law; \n19  (c)  Whether the failure to properly screen, license, support, and supervise \n20  foster homes in which class members are placed is a denial of their rights \n21  under Nevada and federal law; \n22  (d)  Whether the failure to provide class members with timely necessary \n23  medical and mental health screenings, assessments, and treatment denies \n24  their rights under Nevada and federal law; and \n25  (e)  Whether the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for class members is a \n26  denial of their rights under Nevada and federal law. \n27  40.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class they \n28  represent. \n  - 12 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 13 of 73\n \n1  41.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n2  they represent.  Plaintiffs know of no conflict of interest among the class members. \n3  42.  Each named plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is sufficiently \n4  familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the child’s situation to represent the child’s \n5  interests in this litigation fairly and adequately. \n6  43.  Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who will adequately represent \n7  the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs are represented by the National Center for Youth Law, a \n8  privately funded, non-profit organization with extensive national experience in complex class \n9  action litigation involving child welfare systems.  They are also represented by Las Vegas \n10  attorneys Bruno Wolfenzon and Greg Schulman with Wolfenzon Schulman and Katina Ancar and \n11  Sonya Sanchez with Farella Braun & Martell LLP.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have the resources, \n12  expertise, and experience to prosecute this action. \n13  44.  Defendants have acted and refused to act and continue to do so on grounds \n14  generally applicable to the class that plaintiffs represent, thereby rendering appropriate injunctive \n15  and declaratory relief for the class as a whole. \n16  V. \n \n17  FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTORY BACKGROUND \n18  A.  Nevada statutory framework \n19  1.  Child abuse/neglect investigations \n20  45.  In Nevada counties with populations of 100,000 or more, the responsibility for \n21  providing protective services for children rests with the county.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n22  § 432B.325.  In Clark County, this responsibility rests with Clark County DFS. \n23  46.  Clark County DFS is responsible for receiving, screening, and investigating all \n24  reports of suspected child abuse and neglect. \n25  47.  Clark County DFS must immediately initiate an investigation if the report \n26  indicates that the child is five years of age or younger; if there is a high risk of serious harm to the \n27  child; or if the child is living in a household in which another child has died, the child is seriously \n28  injured, or has visible signs of physical abuse.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.260(2).  In all other \n  - 13 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 14 of 73\n \n1  situations, the department must conduct an evaluation within three days of receiving the report to \n2  determine whether an investigation is warranted.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.260(3).  If the \n3  department determines that an investigation is warranted, it must initiate an investigation within \n4  three days of completing the evaluation.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.260(4). \n5  48.  All child protective services investigations must include certain actions.  In all \n6  cases there must be a prompt face-to-face meeting with the child.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.155.  \n7  If there are other children in the household, the caseworker must also assess the protective needs \n8  of each of those children even though they may not be the subject of the report.  Nev. Admin. \n9  Code § 432B.150(3)(c). \n10  49.  The child protective service investigation must be completed within 30 days of \n11  receipt of the report, at which time Clark County DFS must determine if the report is \n12  substantiated or unsubstantiated.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.170 (a).  Upon completion of the \n13  investigation, the department may file a petition with the juvenile court, provide services to the \n14  family to ensure the safety of the child or children, or close the case. \n15  2.  Protective custody and filing of petition \n16  50.  While conducting or upon completion of an investigation, Clark County DFS may \n17  decide to remove the child from the home and place the child in protective custody.  Nev. Rev. \n18  Stat. Ann. § 432B.390. \n19  51.  If the child is placed in protective custody, a juvenile court hearing must take place \n20  within 72 hours to determine whether the child should remain in protective custody or be returned \n21  home pending further action by the Court.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.470(a). \n22  52.  Within ten days of the hearing on protective custody, Clark County DFS must file \n23  a petition to initiate further child welfare proceedings or recommend against further court action.  \n24  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.490(1)(a). \n25  53.  If the child is released from protective custody, Clark County DFS must provide a \n26  range of services to help preserve the family and prevent further placement outside the home, \n27  including, but not limited to: social work and counseling, psychological and medical services, \n28 \n  - 14 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 15 of 73\n \n1  parental education, and services for treatment of substance abuse.  Nev. Admin. Code  \n2  § 432B.240. \n3  3.  Adjudicatory and dispositional hearings \n4  54.  An adjudicatory hearing must be held within 30 days of filing the petition.  Nev. \n5  Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.530(1)-(2).  If the court finds that the allegations in the petition are \n6  unsupported, the petition is dismissed and the child ordered released if he is in protective custody.  \n7  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.530(5).  If the court determines that the allegations in the petition are \n8  true and that the child is in need of protection, Clark County DFS is required to submit a report \n9  and recommendations for the disposition of the case.  If the department recommends that the \n10  child be removed from the custody of her parents, it must submit a plan for ensuring that the child \n11  will receive safe, proper, and appropriate care in the placement, and describe the services that will \n12  be provided to the child and her parents to facilitate the reunification of the family.  Nev. Rev. \n13  Stat. Ann. § 432B.540(2). \n14  55.  Upon receipt of the report and recommendation of Clark County DFS, the court \n15  may order the child to remain in the custody of his parents with or without supervision by Clark \n16  County DFS, place the child in the custody of a relative, or place him in the custody of the \n17  department.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.550. \n18  4.  Appointment of guardian ad litem \n19  56.  Upon the filing of a petition, the court must appoint a guardian ad litem for the \n20  child.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.500.  The guardian ad litem must “represent and protect the \n21  best interests of the child until excused by the court” and “inform the court of the desires of the \n22  child, but exercise his independent judgment regarding the best interests of the child.”  Nev. Rev. \n23  Stat. Ann. § 432B.500(3)(a)&(g).  Among other responsibilities, the guardian ad litem is required \n24  to research the facts of the child’s case and ensure that the court receives an independent, \n25  objective account of the facts; meet with the child at the child’s placement as often as necessary \n26  to determine whether the child is safe and to ascertain that the placement is in the child’s best \n27  interests; participate in the development and negotiation of any plans or orders regarding the \n28  child; monitor whether the plans are being implemented and appropriate services are being \n  - 15 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 16 of 73\n \n1  provided; appear at all proceedings regarding the child; and present recommendations to the \n2  court.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.500(3). \n3  5.  Placement in and supervision of foster family homes \n4  57.  State DCFS is required to establish and ensure the counties’ compliance with \n5  minimum standards for foster family homes, group homes, and other child care facilities in which \n6  foster children are placed.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.020.  In carrying out this obligation, State \n7  DCFS is required to promulgate regulations establishing uniform standards for the licensing of \n8  foster family homes, group homes, and child care institutions.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n9  § 432B.190(1). \n10  58.  Clark County DFS is responsible for licensing foster and group homes in which it \n11  places foster children in its custody and ensuring that those homes meet state standards.  Nev. \n12  Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.030; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.016(1).  Licensing is required in order to \n13  protect children from abuse or neglect and ensure that the foster parent can properly care for \n14  children.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 424.016, 424.030; Nev. Admin. Code § 424.100. \n15  59.  Upon being granted protective or legal custody of a child in foster care, Clark \n16  County DFS selects the foster home or other setting in which the child is placed. \n17  60.  No family foster home can be licensed to care for more than six children, \n18  excluding any children residing in the home who are related to the foster parent or who are not \n19  foster children.  The number of children for whom a home may be licensed must factor in the \n20  foster parents’ own children under the age of 16, as well as the characteristics of the children in \n21  need of placement.  No more than two children under the age of eighteen months or four children \n22  under the age of five may be placed in the same home.  Nev. Admin. Code § 424.160. \n23  61.  Before placing a child in a foster home, Clark County DFS must provide the foster \n24  parent with information necessary to ensure the health and safety of the child and other persons in \n25  the foster home.  That information must include the medical history and behavior of the child.  \n26  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.038.  \n27 \n28 \n  - 16 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 17 of 73\n \n1  62.  Clark County DFS must supervise and monitor the child’s care in a foster home.  \n2  At any time during the child’s placement that it appears that a child lacks proper care and \n3  management, the child must be removed from the home.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.060. \n4  63.  Clark County caseworkers must have at least monthly face-to face contact with \n5  children in foster care.  At least bi-monthly, caseworkers must visit children in their foster care \n6  placements.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.405(a)&(b). \n7  64.  Clark County DFS must also provide support and services to the foster parent \n8  including responding in a timely manner to requests for assistance and establishing a program of \n9  respite care for foster parents to temporarily relieve them of the stresses and responsibilities of \n10  caring for children.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 424.077; Nev. Admin. Code § 424.805. \n11  65.  Clark County DFS must complete an assessment for each child in DFS custody at \n12  least semiannually.  The assessment must include the current level of functioning of the family, \n13  the current risk to the child if he were returned to the custody of his parent, and the services \n14  required to meet the child’s needs as set out in his case plan.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.420(1).  \n15  These assessments must be based, in part, on direct interviews with family members of the child, \n16  personal observations of interaction at home and in the community between the child and family \n17  members, case histories, and medical records.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432B.420(2). \n18  6.  Placement in and supervision of child care institutions  \n \n19 \n66.  Any child care institution used for the placement of foster children must be \n20 \nlicensed by either the city, county, or state, depending on its location.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n21 \n§§ 432A.131, 432A.220.  Child care institutions located within Las Vegas must be licensed by the \n22 \ncity.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432A.131.  It is a misdemeanor offense to operate a child care \n23 \ninstitution without a license.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432A.220. \n24 \n67.  Although Las Vegas has the authority to grant licenses to child care institutions, \n25 \nsuch as Child Haven, that are located within its city limits, the Bureau has the responsibility to \n26 \n“ensure that every person operating a [child care] facility is licensed.”  Nev.

The Bureau Chief is the administrator in charge of ensuring the \n4  proper and efficient performance of the functions of the Bureau.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n5  432A.070.  She has a duty to ensure that no unlicensed facility is allowed to accept children for \n6  placement.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432A.170(1). \n7  68.  Among her duties, the Bureau Chief is responsible for reviewing a roster of all \n8  facilities in the jurisdictions of local agencies that are currently licensed to ascertain if an \n9  unlicensed facility is operating.  Nev. Admin. Code § 432A.180.  Upon information and belief, \n10  the Bureau Chief has known for years that Child Haven operates without a license consequently \n11  exposing children to harm and risk of harm.   \n12  7.  Interstate placements of children \n13  69.  If a child is placed with any person who resides outside of the state, the placement \n14  must follow the procedures and criteria set forth in the Interstate Compact on Placement of \n15  Children (“ICPC”).  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 127.330. \n16  70.  In adopting and enacting the ICPC, the Nevada Legislature sought to ensure that: \n17  (a) each child requiring placement receives the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable \n18  environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to \n19  provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care; (b) the appropriate authorities in a state \n20  where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the \n21  proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the \n22  protection of the child; (c) the proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made \n23  may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected \n24  placement before it is made; and (d) appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of \n25  children are promoted.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 127.330. \n26  71.  The ICPC requires, among other things, that a child must not be sent to the \n27  receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state notify the sending \n28 \n  - 18 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 19 of 73\n \n1  agency, in writing, that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of \n2  the child. \n3  8.  Responsibilities of State Agencies \n4  72.  Nevada DHHS is the “sole agency responsible for administering the provisions of \n5  law relating to its respective divisions”, which includes State DCFS.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n6  § 232.300.  The Director of Nevada DHHS is responsible for carrying out the administration of \n7  State DCFS, preparing a master plan for the provision of human services in the state, and \n8  appointing the Administrator of State DCFS.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 232.320.   \n9  73.  Nevada DHHS is also the “single state agency” responsible for administering \n10  Nevada’s Medicaid program. Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 422.270.  DHHS is responsible for adopting \n11  all Medicaid state plans required by the federal government and to comply with those state plans. \n12  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 422.271. \n13  74.  State DCFS has broad responsibilities to children in the plaintiff class.  Among its \n14  responsibilities, the Division must administer any money granted to the State by the Federal \n15  Government; plan, coordinate, and monitor the delivery of child welfare services provided \n16  throughout the State; and request sufficient money for the provision of child welfare services \n17  throughout the State.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.180.  State DCFS is also required to \n18  promulgate regulations “establishing reasonable and uniform standards for child welfare services” \n19  provided throughout the state.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432 B.190.  The statute identifies 11 \n20  specific program areas in which State Defendants are required to adopt regulations.  Most \n21  importantly, State DCFS is required to “[e]valuate all child welfare services provided throughout \n22  the State and withhold money from any agency providing child welfare services which is not \n23  complying with the regulations adopted ….”  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.180 (8). \n24  75.  For the last three years, State DCFS periodically has evaluated child welfare \n25  services in Clark County.  Those evaluations have uncovered policies and practices that violate \n26  the state and federal constitutional and statutory rights of plaintiffs. \n27  76.  State Defendants have the duty and responsibility to take action, including the \n28  withholding of funds, to correct the violations of plaintiff class members’ state and federal \n  - 19 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 20 of 73\n \n1  constitutional and statutory rights.  They have failed to fulfill those duties thereby allowing those \n2  violations to continue unabated for years, increasing the number of plaintiff class members \n3  harmed and exacerbating the harm suffered by plaintiff class members. \n4  77.  The duties of Nevada DHHS and State DCFS exceed merely documenting and \n5  reviewing other’s documentation of Clark County’s failures to provide safe and proper care.  In \n6  their own words,  \n7  The Division is responsible for Children’s Mental Health (in the \ntwo largest populated counties), Youth Corrections and Child \n8  Welfare Services.  The implementation and administration of Title \nIV-E, Title IV-B, Subpart I (Child Welfare Services) and Subpart 2 \n9  (Promoting Safe and Stable Families), Child Abuse and Treatment \nAct (CAPTA), and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program \n10  (CFCIP) are also the responsibility of the Division.  \n11  Annual Progress & Services Report (APSR) 2005-2009, at 1 (June 30, 2006) (emphasis added).   \n12  B.  Federal statutory framework \n13  1.  The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997: Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social \n14  Security Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 622 et seq.; 671 et seq. \n15  78.  States that meet federally established child welfare standards in the day-to-day \n16  operation of their child welfare programs are eligible for federal child welfare funding under \n17  Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 622 et seq.; 671 et seq.  Nevada \n18  has submitted a mandated State Plan describing how the State will assure compliance with federal \n19  child welfare requirements under these titles, and receives federal child welfare funds.  This State \n20  Plan is a contract into which the State of Nevada enters for the express benefit of plaintiffs, who \n21  are third party beneficiaries of the contract.  Nevada may contract with public or private agencies \n22  to provide direct services, but this does not discharge the State from its responsibility to ensure \n23  that those agencies follow the mandates of the federal statute.  42 U.S.C. § 672 (a)(2)(B); Child \n24  Welfare Policy Manual § 8.1G.    \n25  79.  Defendants Willden and Serrano are responsible for administering any federal \n26  funds for child welfare services, including Title IV-B and IV-E funds, and ensuring county \n27  compliance with federal mandates.  See Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.180(1); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n28  § 232.070.   \n  - 20 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 21 of 73\n \n1  80.  Federal DHHS has stressed in correspondence with Defendant Willden that “the \n2  manner in which the continuum of child welfare services is managed in Clark County should be a \n3  grave concern to the State and should be addressed by the State in its administration and \n4  supervision of the program.”  August 11, 2006 letter from Sharon M. Fujii to Defendant Willden. \n5  81.  Defendants Willden and Serrano are also responsible for the drafting and \n6  negotiation of the Program Improvement Plan (“PIP”) with federal authorities to address \n7  deficiencies uncovered in the administration of their Title IV-B & E program. 45 C.F.R. §1355.  \n8  The PIP identifies the persons responsible for addressing deficiencies in Clark County’s child \n9  welfare program.  Those “responsible persons” identified in the PIP are virtually all officials or \n10  employees of Nevada DHHS or State DCFS.  \n11  82.  Defendants Clark County and Morton are directly responsible for fulfilling the \n12  obligations undertaken by the State of Nevada when it entered into this contract.  Moreover, \n13  pursuant to AB 1, responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of both child protective \n14  services and foster care was vested with Defendants Clark County, Valentine, and County \n15  Commissioners Woodbury, Collins, Maxfield, Gates, Williams, McDonald, and Reid \n16  (collectively “Defendant Commissioners”).  \n17  83.  Federal child welfare mandates with which Nevada must comply include the \n18  following: to place children only in settings that conform to national professional standards and \n19  are subject to a uniformly applied set of standards; to provide quality services that protect foster \n20  children’s safety and health; to provide each child with a written case plan containing specified \n21  elements, and a case review system with specified elements; to place each child in a safe setting \n22  that is the least restrictive and most family like setting; to provide updated health and education \n23  records to foster parents or foster care providers at the time of placement; and to provide notice \n24  and a right to be heard to foster parents and any preadoptive parent or relative providing care in \n25  any proceeding concerning the child.  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(10); 671(16); 671(22); 675(1); 675(5); \n26  675(5)(A); 675(5)(B); 675(5)(D); 675(5)(G); 622(b)(10)(B)(ii). \n27 \n28 \n  - 21 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 22 of 73\n \n1  2.  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act \n(“CAPTA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq. \n2 \n84.  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act \n3 \n(“CAPTA”), as codified at 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq., provides federal grants to states to assist \n4 \nthem in supporting their programs for abused and neglected children.  To receive federal money \n5 \nunder CAPTA, each state must submit a State Plan outlining the areas of child protective services \n6 \nthe state intends to address with the funding, and it must ensure that it is complying with the \n7 \nstatutory provision.  42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(1)(A); 42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(ix).   \n8 \n85.  Nevada has submitted a State Plan to the federal government, and receives federal \n9 \nfunding pursuant to CAPTA.  This State Plan is a contract into which the State of Nevada enters \n10 \nfor the express benefit of plaintiffs, who are third party beneficiaries of the contract.   \n11 \n86.  Defendants Willden and Serrano are responsible for administering any federal \n12 \nfunds for child welfare services, including CAPTA funds, and ensuring county compliance with \n13 \nfederal mandates.  See Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180(1); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 232.070.  \n14 \nDefendants Willden and Serrano are in charge of planning, coordinating, and monitoring the \n15 \ndelivery of child welfare services provided throughout the state, as well as evaluating all child \n16 \nwelfare services and withholding money from any agency that is not complying with pertinent \n17 \nregulations.  Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180(6).  They are also \n18 \nresponsible for promulgating regulations to establish uniform standards for child welfare services \n19 \nprovided in the state.  Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.190(1).  Defendants Clark County and Morton are \n20 \ndirectly responsible for fulfilling the obligations undertaken by the State of Nevada when it \n21 \nentered into this contract.  Moreover, pursuant to AB 1, Defendants Valentine and County \n22 \nCommissioners are responsible for the implementation of the requirements in the State Plan.   \n23 \n87.  CAPTA specifically requires that every abused or neglected child who is the \n24 \nsubject of a judicial proceeding must be represented by a properly trained guardian ad litem.  42 \n25 \nU.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii).  The guardian ad litem may be an attorney or a court-appointed \n26 \nspecial advocate, or both.  Since the original enactment of this federal mandate, Congress has \n27 \namended the provision several times to describe explicitly and amplify the duties of the guardian \n28 \n  - 22 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 23 of 73\n \n1  ad litem.  For example, the guardian ad litem must obtain a first-hand, clear understanding of the \n2  situation and needs of the child and make recommendations to the court concerning the best \n3  interests of the child.  42 U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii). \n4  3.  The Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment \n(EPSDT) Services, 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1396v \n5 \n6  88.  Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that directs federal funding to \n7  states to assist them in providing medical assistance to low income people under Title XIX of the \n8  Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C §§ 1396-1396v.  States choose whether to participate in Medicaid.  \n9  To receive Medicaid funds, states must adhere to the minimum federal requirements according to \n10  the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 430 et seq.  DHHS is the \n11  single state agency responsible under federal law for the administration of the Medicaid program \n12  in Nevada.   \n13  89.  To participate in Medicaid, states must submit and have approved by the Secretary \n14  of Health and Human Services a state plan for medical assistance.  The Medicaid Act requires \n15  that each state plan “provide for making medical assistance available, including at least the care \n16  and services listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), (17), (21) of section 1396d(a) of this title, to all \n17  individuals [listed under certain statutory provisions].” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  Early and \n18  Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (“EPSDT”) services, for Medicaid-eligible \n19  children under the age of 21, are among the mandatory categories of medical assistance.  Id. at §§ \n20  1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r).  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5) states \n21  must cover necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures described in \n22  subsection 1396d(a) when needed to correct or ameliorate physical or mental health problems. \n23  90.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(B), states must provide or arrange for screening \n24  services in all cases where they are requested and, under § 1396a(a)(43)(C), must arrange for, \n25  directly or through referral to appropriate individuals, needed corrective treatment. \n26  91.  Nevada has submitted a State Plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and \n27  receives federal funding.  Nevada’s State Plan is a contract into which the State of Nevada enters \n28  for the express benefit of plaintiffs, who are third party beneficiaries of the contract.

Defendant Willden is responsible for administering these federal funds, and ensuring \n3  county compliance with federal mandates.  See Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 232.070.  Defendant \n4  Serrano is responsible for administering this program with respect to children in the child welfare \n5  system.  Nev. Rev. Stat. § 432B.180(1).  Defendants Clark County and Morton are directly \n6  responsible at the county level for fulfilling the obligations of federal Medicaid law.  Moreover, \n7  pursuant to AB 1, Defendants Valentine and County Commissioners are responsible for the \n8  implementation of the requirements in the State Plan.  \n9  92.  Under its Medicaid program, Nevada must provide EPSDT care to eligible \n10  children under the age of 21.  Virtually all children under the age of 21 who are in foster care are \n11  eligible for Medicaid.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  Accordingly, Nevada is mandated to \n12  provide EPSDT care to these children. \n13  VI. \n \n14  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS FOR NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n15  A.  Clark K. \n16  93.  Clark is a seventeen-year-old youth who came into the legal custody of Clark \n17  County DFS in July 2003.  Prior to that time, the department had received ten reports of abuse or \n18  neglect involving Clark and/or his siblings. \n19  94.  While in DFS custody, Clark has been placed in inappropriate and dangerous \n20  placements, which have been harmful to his physical, mental, and emotional well-being.  He has \n21  been denied adequate food, clothing and shelter; subjected to frequent changes in placement; \n22  denied necessary medical and mental health care; denied an education and special education \n23  services; separated from his siblings; denied other necessary services to meet his needs; and \n24  denied access to any sort of representation by an attorney or guardian ad litem. \n25  95.  In September 1999, Clark’s mother moved from Las Vegas to Texas, and took \n26  Clark with her.  Clark and his mother lived with approximately ten other relatives in a two-\n27  bedroom trailer.  Most of their food came out of dumpsters behind grocery stores because Clark’s \n28  mother spent her money on drugs.  About a year later, Clark’s mother took him with her to live in \n  - 24 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 25 of 73\n \n1  Virginia.  In Virginia, he was often left with strangers while his mother was off buying, dealing, \n2  and taking illegal drugs.  Clark missed many days of school due to his mother’s absence, neglect, \n3  and instability.  As a result of these absences, Clark was held back at least one grade. \n4  96.  In December 2001, Clark and his mother returned to Texas.  Subsequently, Clark \n5  contacted his grandparents in Las Vegas and pleaded with them to rescue him from the unsafe \n6  and unhealthy living arrangement in Texas.  His grandmother drove to Texas, and brought Clark \n7  back to live with her and his grandfather in Las Vegas. \n8  97.  Following Clark’s arrival at their home, his grandparents contacted Clark County \n9  DFS and shared information about the unsafe living environment Clark had endured in Texas.  At \n10  the advice of DFS, Clark’s grandparents first were appointed legal guardianship of Clark and his \n11  younger brother on August 14, 2002, and later became licensed foster parents.  During the entire \n12  time that Clark lived with his grandparents, he attended school regularly, got good grades, and \n13  was in good health.  Clark’s younger brother also lived with him and his grandparents for much \n14  of the time. \n15  98.  In July of 2003, Clark’s grandparents transitioned from being his legal guardians \n16  to being his licensed foster parents, and Clark was taken into foster care.  On or about July 25, \n17  2003, Clark County DFS placed Clark and his younger brother in the custody of their paternal \n18  grandparents.  Clark did not receive notice of any hearing on this matter, nor was he represented \n19  by an attorney or guardian ad litem.  Although Clark’s grandparents had discussed Clark’s need \n20  for a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) with his caseworker, he was never provided \n21  one.  On or about August 26, 2003, a petition for abuse/neglect was filed on Clark and his \n22  younger brother and they were found to be in need of protection and within the jurisdiction of the \n23  Court pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 432B.  From this point on, if not earlier, Clark was in \n24  the legal custody of Clark County DFS. \n25  99.  On September 17, 2003, a dispositional hearing was held on Clark’s Petition for \n26  Neglect.  Clark’s grandparents went to the courthouse to attend the hearing, but were refused \n27  entry into the courtroom.  Clark’s caseworker knew that Clark’s grandparents were at the \n28  courthouse and that they wished to attend the hearing and provide input, but they were denied an \n  - 25 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 26 of 73\n \n1  opportunity to express Clark’s wishes or explain their concerns for his safety should he be \n2  returned to his mother in Texas.  Clark’s caseworker did not notify Clark about the hearing, tell \n3  him the purpose of the hearing, or ask him whether he wanted to go back to Texas.  Clark was \n4  given no opportunity to speak to the court or have anyone else represent his interests.  Had he \n5  been asked about his wishes, or allowed to speak at the hearing, he would have told the court that \n6  he absolutely did not want to go back and live with his mother in Texas and would have \n7  explained the reasons he was afraid to be placed with her.  Nonetheless, at this hearing, the Court \n8  ordered that Clark be “reunified” with his mother in Texas. \n9  100.  Subsequently, Clark’s caseworker told his grandparents and Clark that the court \n10  had decided that he should be placed back with his mother in Texas.  Clark’s grandparents were \n11  strongly opposed to this decision and expressed their concerns to Clark County DFS.  They sent \n12  letters to DFS caseworkers and administrators describing their concerns regarding Clark’s safety \n13  and health should he be returned to Texas.  Clark County DFS never responded to their letters or \n14  addressed their concerns. \n15  101.  Throughout October 2003, Clark County DFS attempted to get Clark’s \n16  grandparents to disenroll him from school and take him to the airport to go to Texas.  They \n17  refused. \n18  102.  On October 21, 2003, a Clark County DFS caseworker spoke to Clark for the first \n19  time about his impending placement back with his mother in Texas.  The caseworker told Clark \n20  that he had spoken to Clark’s mother and that she reported that she had a job, was not using \n21  drugs, and could take care of him.  Clark responded:  “It’s horrible down there . . . I know my \n22  mom . . . she can’t keep a steady job . . . she has been on drugs since I was little . . . I know what \n23  it’s like down there.  I don’t want to go.” \n24  103.  Despite Clark’s strong desire to remain with his grandparents, his articulated \n25  concerns about going to live with his mother in Texas, and his history of neglect in Texas, Clark \n26  County DFS nonetheless forced him to return to Texas.  In late October 2003, Clark’s caseworker \n27  picked Clark up at his house, drove him to the airport, walked him to security, and put him on a \n28  flight to Houston, Texas.  By doing so, Defendants greatly increased the danger to Clark by \n  - 26 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 27 of 73\n \n1  taking the affirmative step of removing him from a safe environment and placing him in a \n2  dangerous living situation against his wishes. \n3  104.  Clark’s caseworker failed to complete an assessment of his safety before returning \n4  him to his mother’s custody.  The caseworker made no attempt to confirm what Clark’s mother \n5  had told him during their brief phone conversations.  He did not contact her alleged employer, her \n6  alleged landlord, or the local Texas child protective services.  Despite her years of drug abuse, he \n7  did not require that she submit verification of successfully completing treatment or that she \n8  submit to a drug screen.  He also did not conduct any criminal background check with Texas \n9  authorities.  In addition, Clark County DFS failed to comply with the requirements of the \n10  Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, to which both Texas and Nevada are signators.  \n11  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 127.320-350; Tex. Fam. Code § 162.101 et seq. \n12  105.  Had the caseworker conducted a reasonable investigation, he would have learned \n13  that Clark’s mother was on probation for burglary, had been without a job for a very long time, \n14  and had no suitable housing.  She was sharing an overcrowded trailer with her alcoholic parents, \n15  and was continuing to abuse drugs and alcohol. \n16  106.  After sending Clark to Texas, Clark County DFS essentially washed their hands of \n17  him altogether.  They made no efforts to determine whether he was safe with his mother, nor did \n18  they follow up with anyone in Texas to ensure that his needs were being met. \n19  107.  Once again, Clark led a miserable life in Texas.  He initially lived with his mother, \n20  maternal grandmother, and many others in a filthy trailer.  At any given time, there were at least \n21  eight people sharing the trailer with five or six dogs.  Animal feces were littered throughout.  \n22  Clark slept on a filthy mattress on a bunk bed that he shared with his grandmother, or he slept on \n23  the floor.  Clark was surrounded by drug use and drug dealing.  His mother used and sold \n24  everything from marijuana to crack in Clark’s presence.  His relatives stole his possessions \n25  (including clothes, shoes, socks, hats, CDs, a CD player, a guitar, a backpack, and a bike), and \n26  sold them for drug money. \n27  108.  Clark often went several days without food.  Although his mother was receiving \n28  food stamps for him, she traded them for drugs.  She and her parents frequently dug food out of \n  - 27 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 28 of 73\n \n1  dumpsters for themselves and Clark to eat.  At other times he would only have a few crackers and \n2  applesauce.  Much of the time, his only meal of the day was the free lunch he received at school. \n3  109.  For the year and a half he was left in Texas, Clark was moved around among \n4  various family members, moving about twelve times.  Most of the time they moved from one \n5  trailer park to another.  At one point they were all living out of a truck with a camper shell on the \n6  back.  During most of his time in Texas, Clark was virtually abandoned by his mother.  She \n7  would frequently disappear on drug binges; she never held down a job; and she never provided \n8  for his basic needs. \n9  110.  Although Clark was getting A’s and B’s in school when he lived with his \n10  grandparents in Las Vegas, upon placement with his mother in Texas, his grades plummeted.  In \n11  some of the places he was taken to live, he had no transportation to school.  He also never \n12  received the special education services to which he was entitled based on previous assessments \n13  and an IEP adopted while attending Clark County School District.  In addition, during the entire \n14  time he was in Texas, his mother never provided him with medication to address his attention \n15  deficit hyperactivity disorder, which made it even more difficult for him to concentrate in school. \n16  111.  Finally, in the spring of 2005, Clark managed to get in touch with his grandmother \n17  in Las Vegas.  With help from his sister, Clark took a Greyhound bus back to his grandparents in \n18  Las Vegas in April 2005.   \n19  112.  Shortly after returning to Las Vegas, Clark’s family contacted Clark County DFS \n20  to tell them Clark had returned to live with his grandparents.  Subsequently, DFS attempted to \n21  locate Clark’s mother, but was not successful.   \n22  113.  Despite the traumatic events Clark experienced in Texas, he was denied medical \n23  assistance upon his return to Las Vegas.  Medicaid-covered services were requested by his \n24  grandparents, but not provided, arranged, or paid for by Defendants.   \n25  114.  In particular, Clark was in need of a comprehensive mental health assessment and \n26  therapeutic services, including counseling, medication management and monitoring, and \n27  physician and outpatient services, that were necessary to correct or ameliorate his mental health \n28  condition, and rehabilitative services required to achieve the maximum reduction of physical or \n  - 28 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 29 of 73\n \n1  mental disability and restoration to the best possible functioning.  These services are mandated \n2  under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A) as defined in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), (a)(5)(A), \n3  (a)(2)(A), and (a)(13), as well as under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(B) & (C).   Despite repeated \n4  requests by his grandparents, Clark County DFS failed to provide or arrange for such services.  In \n5  fact, not only did Clark’s grandparents request services, they made appointments that were then \n6  cancelled by DFS and never rescheduled.  For example, Clark’s grandparents made an \n7  appointment with Dr. Bonnie Winkelman, a psychologist, for June 2005, but the caseworker told \n8  his grandparents that the appointment was cancelled and that DFS handles all medical \n9  appointments – including any counseling or psychological services – for the children, and the \n10  grandparents were not allowed to make appointments or take Clark to appointments.  Clark’s \n11  grandfather also made an appointment with Debi Bhattacharyya, a Child and Family Intervention \n12  Specialist with DFS, to have Clark evaluated.  Ms.  Bhattacharyya cancelled the appointment, and \n13  DFS did not follow up to make a replacement appointment.  Later, the DFS caseworker said DFS \n14  would take him to Mojave Mental Health for an evaluation, but they never did.  \n15  115.  Clark County DFS also failed to provide him with any educational services to \n16  make up for the significant time he was not in school.  In the absence of any services or assistance \n17  from DFS, Clark and his grandparents researched various training programs and decided that \n18  Clark should attend Job Corps.   \n19  116.  Clark was accepted at the Job Corps in Reno, and began living there and attending \n20  classes and vocational training.  However, on or around March 15, 2006, Clark went missing.  \n21  Although Job Corps officials notified Clark County DFS of Clark’s disappearance, little or no \n22  attempts were made to locate him.  Even after the court directed DFS to do everything in their \n23  power to find Clark, DFS took few, if any, steps to determine Clark’s whereabouts.  At one point, \n24  Clark called the DFS hotline and told them he was ready to go home to his grandparents, but DFS \n25  failed to take timely action to help bring him back to a safe placement. \n26  117.  Clark lived on the streets in Reno for about three months, until he eventually \n27  learned about a program called “Home Free” sponsored by the National Runaway Switchboard.  \n28 \n  - 29 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 30 of 73\n \n1  He was provided with a free one-way Greyhound ticket back to his grandparents in Las Vegas.  \n2  He returned to their care on May 19, 2006. \n3  118.  Since returning to Las Vegas, Clark has received almost no independent living \n4  services, or any other kind of services from Clark County DFS.  His caseworker has been \n5  unresponsive to multiple calls from Clark’s grandparents to follow up on securing needed \n6  services.  Clark is afraid to go back to school because he is now so far behind.  He still has \n7  significant unmet mental health needs, and lives with the fear that DFS could again take him from \n8  his grandparents and send him to an unsafe placement against his will.  He has difficulty trusting \n9  adults or believing that anyone cares about him.  He worries that people are like his relatives in \n10  Texas – just waiting to do him in.   \n11  B.  The A. Children \n12  119.  Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. are siblings – four boys and one girl, ages \n13  nine, eight, six, five, and two, respectively.  They have been in the custody of Clark County DFS \n14  since December 2004.  Their baby brother, Jerome, died in a DFS-licensed foster home on April \n15  3, 2005, at the age of 14 months. \n16  120.  While in DFS custody, these five children have been placed in multiple \n17  inappropriate and dangerous placements that have been harmful to their physical, mental, and \n18  emotional well-being.  They have been placed in a restrictive, overcrowded, and dangerous child \n19  care facility (Child Haven) for almost a year; subjected to further emotional and physical abuse \n20  and neglect while in foster and shelter homes; placed in shelter and foster homes that lacked the \n21  information and services to care adequately for their basic needs; denied medical assistance to \n22  address their history of abuse and neglect; denied visitation and contact with relatives; denied \n23  representation by either a guardian ad litem or an attorney during their first year in foster care; \n24  and separated from each other for long periods of time. \n25  121.  The A. children first came into foster care after the youngest sibling, King, tested \n26  positive for drugs when he was born in December 2004.  The children were initially taken to \n27  Child Haven for a day, and then were split up and placed in three different DFS-licensed foster \n28  and shelter homes.  The three oldest children were placed in the foster home of Joan Smith.  \n  - 30 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 31 of 73\n \n1  About a month later, Caleb and Jerome were moved into the Smith home with their siblings.  \n2  King was placed in a different foster home, separated from his siblings. \n3  122.  While in the Smith home, the children were physically and emotionally abused as \n4  a result of Clark County DFS’s failure to provide adequate training, supervision, and support to \n5  foster parents; failure to investigate reports of abuse and neglect; and failure to remove children \n6  from dangerous placements. \n7  123.  Within their first month of placement, Ms. Smith had difficulty caring for the five \n8  children who at the time ranged in age from one year to six years of age.  During this time, Ms. \n9  Smith was also having problems with her troubled adopted daughter, who was regularly running \n10  away from home.  In February or March 2005, Ms. Smith began making repeated requests to \n11  Clark County DFS, both verbally and in writing, to remove the children from her home.  Upon \n12  information and belief, DFS failed to respond to these requests and failed to provide Ms. Smith \n13  with any supportive services to help her care for the A. children. \n14  124.  Clark County DFS also failed to investigate multiple reports of abuse and neglect \n15  while the children were living at the Smith home.  While visiting Jerome in the hospital in \n16  February 2005, the children’s biological father observed bruises on Jerome.  During another visit \n17  with all of the children, they told their father that they were being mistreated at the Smith home \n18  by both the foster mother and her adopted daughter, and that Ms. Smith would hit infant Jerome.  \n19  Although the children’s father made multiple reports to DFS of the abuse occurring in the Smith \n20  home, DFS did not investigate the reports, and let all five children remain in the home until \n21  Jerome was tragically scalded to death on April 3, 2005. \n22  125.  Despite the reports of abuse in the home and Ms. Smith’s requests to have the A. \n23  children removed, Clark County DFS placed another infant in Ms. Smith’s home in February or \n24  March 2005.  At this time, Ms. Smith had seven children in her home: the five A. children, her \n25  adopted twelve-year-old daughter, and the new infant. \n26  126.  When she was originally licensed for foster care in August 2002, Ms. Smith was \n27  granted a license for only three female children, ages 11-18 years.  On April 16, 2004, Ms. Smith \n28  was issued a Group Foster Home license for four male or female children, ages 0-17 years.  On its \n  - 31 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 32 of 73\n \n1  face, this license noted “there is only one bedroom allocated to foster children in this home.”  \n2  Effective September 20, 2004, her capacity was increased to five beds, and effective January 4, \n3  2005, her capacity was increased to six beds.  On April 1, 2005, just two days before Jerome’s \n4  death, her shelter care license for six beds was renewed. \n5  127.  Clark County DFS’s increases in the licensed capacity of Ms. Smith’s home did \n6  not take into consideration her training, abilities, or demonstrated record of caring for such a large \n7  number of foster children.  Rather, it was based solely on the need for more shelter care beds in \n8  the county. \n9  128.  On April 3, 2005, Ms. Smith left the A. children at home alone with her teenage \n10  adoptive daughter.  While Ms. Smith was at the hospital with her other foster infant, fourteen-\n11  month-old Jerome was scalded to death in the bathtub at the Smith home.  At least two of \n12  Jerome’s siblings witnessed his death. \n13  129.  On November 8, 2005, the City of North Las Vegas filed criminal charges against \n14  Ms. Smith related to Jerome’s death.  Smith ultimately pled guilty and is currently serving her \n15  sentence of a few months in a Clark County facility.  Her foster care license was revoked. \n16  130.  The day after Jerome’s death, his five surviving siblings were placed at Child \n17  Haven.  A few days later, all of the siblings except for King, who remained at Child Haven, were \n18  placed in another foster home.  During their first week at this home, the children were left home \n19  alone at night multiple times.  They were subsequently removed from this placement after less \n20  than two weeks and returned to Child Haven where they remained from April 2005 through May \n21  2006 – over a year and a month. \n22  131.  For the thirteen months the A. children were in Child Haven, they were subject to \n23  restrictive, overcrowded, oppressive conditions, and denied necessary services, resulting in \n24  deterioration of their mental and physical health and well-being.  At the time when they most \n25  needed a caring environment, they were forced to give up their personal clothes and belongings; \n26  were required to wear communal clothing; were not allowed to attend school in the community \n27  for at least ten months; were given only limited visiting time with parents and relatives; and were \n28 \n  - 32 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 33 of 73\n \n1  subjected to a point-based discipline system inappropriate for children of their young ages — \n2  conditions that have lead Child Haven to be described as a “junior prison.”   \n3  132.  After King was moved back to the infant building at Child Haven, he developed \n4  serious respiratory problems.  His condition was so severe that he was not allowed to go outside, \n5  and had to have breathing treatments twice a day.  He was in need of services that are mandated \n6  under 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(10)(A) as defined in 42 U.S.C. §§1396d(a)(5)(A) (physician services), \n7  1396d(a)(6) (medical care), and 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(4)(B) (EPSDT).   His condition persisted \n8  for over nine months before he was taken outside Child Haven to see a specialist.   \n9  133.  At Child Haven the A. children were denied needed medical assistance to help \n10  them cope with witnessing the death of their infant brother, as well as the abuse and neglect they \n11  have experienced in their short lives.  Jalen is the only child who has received any mental health \n12  services, and the little counseling he was provided at Child Haven was on an “as needed” basis \n13  and was inadequate to meet his needs.  When the children’s aunt Tarrah asked Child Haven staff \n14  why the children were not receiving mental health services following the death of their infant \n15  brother, she was told by staff that Child Haven is “not a placement,” and because of this DFS \n16  does not have to provide them with any services while they are there.   \n17  134.  Accordingly, the A. children went over a year without a comprehensive health or \n18  mental health assessment and therapeutic services, including counseling, medication management \n19  and monitoring, and physician and outpatient services, that were necessary to correct or \n20  ameliorate their health and mental health conditions, and rehabilitative services required to \n21  achieve the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration to the best \n22  possible functioning.  These services are mandated under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a (a)(10)(A) as defined \n23  in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), (a)(5)(A), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(13), as well as under 42 U.S.C. § \n24  1396a(a)(43)(B) & (C).     Despite the trauma and grief they had experienced, Clark County DFS \n25  failed to provide or arrange for such services.   \n26  135.  The A. children also received inadequate educational services while at Child \n27  Haven.  Jalen and Sia, the two older children, never attended school in the community during the \n28  entire year and a month they were placed at Child Haven; they were only allowed to attend the \n  - 33 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 34 of 73\n \n1  on-site school with other children living at Child Haven.  Caleb and Roshaun were finally able to \n2  attend a school in the community for a half-day after they had been in Child Haven for over ten \n3  months. \n4  136.  Tarrah visited the children at Child Haven about every other weekend from April \n5  2005 through March 2006.  However, in the Spring of 2006, a County DFS caseworker informed \n6  Tarrah that she could no longer visit with her nieces and nephews because it would give them \n7  “false hope.”  The caseworker did not allow Tarrah a goodbye visit with the children nor did she \n8  allow Tarrah to explain to the children that she was not abandoning them, but rather it was the \n9  department’s decision to terminate her visits.  The children now have no stable adult figure in \n10  their lives. \n11  137.  In May 2006, the children were moved from Child Haven to another foster home.  \n12  This is the fifth placement change for Jalen, Sia, and Roshaun since they entered Clark County \n13  DFS custody in December 2004.  It is Caleb’s fourth placement change, and King’s third \n14  placement change since entering foster care in December 2004, and they are all at risk of future \n15  placement changes, including being returned once again to Child Haven. \n16  C.  The B. Children  \n17  138.  Eight-year-old Summer, six-year-old Frank, and five-year-old Toni B. are siblings.  \n18  They have been in the legal custody of Clark County DFS since October 2002. \n19  139.  While in foster care, the B. children have been placed with a series of foster \n20  parents who were given little background information about the children and were not trained or \n21  supported to meet the children’s special needs.  As a direct and foreseeable result, the children \n22  changed placements many times, with Frank and Summer experiencing between five and seven \n23  placements within three months.  The children were also physically and emotionally abused in at \n24  least one foster home, and have been placed at Child Haven several times.  In addition, Clark \n25  County DFS failed to conduct a proper investigation of reports of abuse of Summer and Frank, \n26  and failed to provide the children with needed health and educational services.  For the first year \n27  that the children were in DFS custody, they were not represented by a guardian ad litem. \n28 \n  - 34 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 35 of 73\n \n1  140.  On October 3, 2002, Clark County DFS assumed legal custody of then eleven-\n2  month-old Toni, three-and-a-half-year-old Summer, and two-year-old Frank when the children \n3  were brought to Child Haven by a baby sitter who reported that the mother had abandoned them.  \n4  DFS petitioned the juvenile court to find the children abused and neglected based upon the \n5  mother’s history of substance abuse, including having taken methamphetamine during her \n6  pregnancy with Toni, and the father’s incarceration.  The children were placed in the DFS \n7  licensed shelter home of Marilyn Paikai, where they lived for the next six months. \n8  141.  Upon their entry into foster care, all three children demonstrated multiple special \n9  needs.  Frank suffered anxiety attacks and night terrors, and often banged his head from one side \n10  of the crib to the other in the middle of the night.  His language skills were not developmentally \n11  appropriate for a child his age.  Summer was physically aggressive toward her younger siblings, \n12  and her other behaviors suggested that she had been the victim of sexual abuse.  One of \n13  Summer’s foster parents took her to the doctor after she complained of “burning” on her \n14  “bottom,” and the examination revealed that she had genital warts.  Although her therapist \n15  subsequently reported to Clark County DFS that she suspected Summer had been sexually \n16  abused, DFS never investigated these concerns or reports.  Toni was underweight and emotionally \n17  disturbed.  Her behavior was self-abusive – pulling her hair out, banging her head on the walls \n18  and floor, and biting her arms.  One mental health therapist described little Toni as “a bundle of \n19  raw nerves.”  Others suspected she suffered from Down Syndrome.  She was hypertonic and was \n20  very difficult to console and relax. \n21  142.  On April 9, 2003, all three children were removed from Mrs. Paikai’s shelter \n22  home, supposedly to be placed in a permanent placement.  However, they stayed at their next \n23  foster care placement with the Jackson family for less than seven weeks before being moved \n24  again.  At the time the children came to live with them, the Jacksons were newly licensed and had \n25  recently completed the foster parent training program.  They had never cared for any other foster \n26  children, and had no experience or training in caring for children with the extent of special needs \n27  of Toni, Summer, and Frank.  The Jacksons also had two young children of their own – ages three \n28  and six. \n  - 35 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 36 of 73\n \n1  143.  Almost from the first day the children were placed in the Jackson foster home, the \n2  foster parents began calling the caseworker asking for help with their care of the children.  They \n3  did not know how to respond to the children’s behaviors.  Summer, for example, threw temper \n4  tantrums, forced herself to vomit, and attacked her younger brother. \n5  144.  Clark County DFS did not return the foster parents’ calls nor did they provide any \n6  supportive services that might have enabled the Jacksons to continue caring for the children and \n7  prevented another disruption in the children’s placement. \n8  145.  On May 26, 2003, the Jackson foster father called and asked Mrs. Paikai, the \n9  former shelter care mother, to provide them with respite by taking the children for the day.  She \n10  agreed and the foster father dropped off the children at her home.  When the time came for the \n11  foster father to pick up the children later that day, he refused to do so. \n12  146.  Mrs. Paikai then called Child Haven and reported that she had the children back in \n13  her home but had bed space only for one.  Child Haven staff told Mrs. Paikai to keep the children \n14  and call back on Tuesday after the holiday weekend.  The children remained in Mrs. Paikai’s \n15  home until the following Friday when the caseworker picked up Summer and Frank, and decided \n16  that Toni would remain with Mrs. Paikai. \n17  147.  Toni remained in Mrs. Paikai’s shelter home for more than two years – until \n18  August 2005 – when she was returned to her mother on a trial basis.  During the entire time Toni \n19  was placed with Mrs. Paikai, her Clark County DFS caseworker made only one visit to the foster \n20  home to check on the well-being of Toni. \n21  148.  For the next three months, between June and August 2003, Summer and Frank \n22  were moved every two weeks from one foster home to another.  Altogether they were moved five \n23  or six times in less than three months.  After being moved five or six times, they went back to \n24  Child Haven for six weeks. \n25  149.  In each home selected by Clark County DFS, the foster parents were not \n26  adequately trained nor did they have the experience and skills to provide the type of intensive \n27  care that Summer and Frank required. \n28 \n  - 36 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 37 of 73\n \n1  150.  Frank was physically abused by the foster mother in one of the foster homes \n2  through which County DFS shuttled Summer and Frank between June and August 2003.  In July \n3  2003, during a visit with their biological mother, the children told her that the foster mother was \n4  hitting them.  Frank pulled down his pants and showed his mother a black and blue bruise on his \n5  left hip the size of a baseball.  The mother called the caseworker in and told her about the bruise \n6  and what the children had said. \n7  151.  Following the mother’s report of abuse in the foster home, the caseworker failed to \n8  take pictures of Frank’s injury.  The caseworker did not refer the report of abuse to an \n9  investigator, but instead took Summer and Frank out one at a time to talk to them.  After these \n10  conversations with the children and without conducting any investigation, the caseworker took \n11  the children back to the same foster home the children had complained about.  Upon returning the \n12  children to this foster home, the caseworker merely reminded the foster parent not to hit kids. \n13  152.  Several days after the children reported abuse in the foster home, the foster mother \n14  called and admitted to Mrs. Paikai that she had hit Summer; she insisted that Summer needed to \n15  be on medication to deal with her out of control behaviors.  She also admitted that she punished \n16  Summer by making her lay in her bed for four or five hours during the day. \n17  153.  The very next morning after the phone call from the foster mother, Mrs. Paikai \n18  called the children’s caseworker.  She told her about the conversation she had with the foster \n19  mother and expressed her concerns for the safety of the children.  Following this call, the \n20  caseworker removed Summer and Frank from the foster home – seven days after Frank showed \n21  the bruise to his mother and she reported it to the caseworker. \n22  154.  Upon removing the children from the abusive foster home, the caseworker asked \n23  Mrs. Paikai to keep them.  However, Mrs. Paikai had no bed space available and was at her \n24  licensed capacity.  Nonetheless, with the plea of the caseworker that there was nowhere else for \n25  the children to go, she agreed to keep them until the worker could find another home.  While they \n26  were back with Mrs. Paikai, Summer and Frank told her that the foster mother threatened them \n27  with being sent back to Child Haven and told Summer that if she did not stop crying, staff there \n28  would pull her eyes out. \n  - 37 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 38 of 73\n \n1  155.  Subsequently, Frank and Summer were placed with Mrs. Paikai’s sister who was a \n2  licensed foster parent.  In the new foster home, the children demonstrated much of the same \n3  behaviors and special needs that they had shown in the previous homes.  Their new foster mother \n4  repeatedly called the caseworker for support with the care of the children but her calls, too, were \n5  never returned.  For the entire two weeks the children were in this foster home no one from Clark \n6  County DFS came to check on the children or responded to the foster mother’s pleas for help. \n7  156.  With no support, assistance, or response to her pleas for help, the foster mother \n8  took the children to a therapist’s office in search of some assistance.  When the therapist called \n9  the caseworker, she told her to take the children back to Child Haven.  Following these \n10  instructions, the therapist transported the children back to Child Haven, where they remained for \n11  another five weeks. \n12  157.  In August 2003, Summer and Frank were placed in the therapeutic foster home of \n13  Rosie and Robert Beck.  They lived in this home for two years. \n14  158.  At the end of August 2005, Clark County DFS returned all three children to their \n15  mother — while maintaining legal custody.  DFS did not perform the requisite safety assessment \n16  prior to placing the children with their mother.  Indeed, at the time the decision was made, the \n17  caseworker stated that she was “95% certain that placement back with the mother will fail.”  By \n18  doing so, Defendants greatly increased the danger to the B. children by taking the affirmative step \n19  of removing them from a safe placement and placing them in a dangerous living situation.     \n20  159.  During the “trial” time with their mother, the children’s educational, mental health, \n21  and medical needs went unmet.  For the entire time that Toni lived with her mother she was not \n22  enrolled in, nor did she attend one day of, school.  She had previously been enrolled at the early \n23  Program for Delayed Children of Clark County, and was receiving special education services, \n24  weekly speech therapy, and occupational therapy.  While living with her mother, she did not \n25  receive any of the special education or related services she had been receiving.  As a result, \n26  Toni’s speech, behavior, and educational progress deteriorated significantly.  Her speech became \n27  unintelligible.  Her medical needs also went unmet.  \n28 \n  - 38 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 39 of 73\n \n1  160.  In October 2005, while back with her mother, Clark County DFS received a report \n2  that Summer had a suspicious burn on her thigh.  Upon information and belief, this report was not \n3  properly investigated.  School authorities also reported concerns about Summer, and that she was \n4  missing many days of school.  On several occasions during this “trial visit” with their mother, the \n5  children were caught in the middle of domestic violence between their mother and her boyfriend. \n6  161.  On January 6, 2006, the trial placement with the children’s mother was abruptly \n7  ended, and Toni, Summer, and Frank were returned to foster care.  Upon information and belief, \n8  the removal of the children was prompted by the mother’s failing a drug test and calls from \n9  Summer’s school reporting that the children were being left alone. \n10  162.  The return of the children to foster care was handled in a manner inconsistent with \n11  the safety, needs, and well-being of the children and in violation of professional standards and \n12  common sense.  After a loud and disturbing argument and struggle with their mother in front of \n13  the B. children, the caseworker put the children in her car.  She then called Summer and Frank’s \n14  former foster parent, Rosie Beck, and asked her to meet her at a major intersection in Las Vegas.  \n15  The caseworker then drove into a parking lot and handed off the children to Mrs. Beck.  Summer \n16  refused to get out of the car until the caseworker told her that she would be taken to Child Haven \n17  if she did not go with Mrs. Beck.  The caseworker provided the foster mother with no paperwork \n18  or authorization to care for the children. \n19  163.  Upon the children’s return to foster care in January 2006, the Clark County DFS \n20  caseworker did not contact Mrs. Paikai to ask if she would resume care of Toni and her siblings.  \n21  DFS refused to place Toni in the foster home in which she had spent most of her life, despite the \n22  repeated requests of Mrs. Paikai.  Instead, the agency placed the children with foster parents who \n23  are in their sixties and have three other special needs children.  Despite the advice of Toni’s \n24  physician that it was in Toni’s best interest to continue contact with Mrs. Paikai and her husband, \n25  DFS has cut off all contact between Toni and the Paikais. \n26  D.  Donna C. \n27  164.  Six-year-old Donna C. has been in the legal custody of Clark County DFS since \n28  December 2004.  She is currently placed in a DFS licensed foster home. \n  - 39 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 40 of 73\n \n1  165.  Since Clark County DFS assumed custody of Donna, she has been denied \n2  necessary and appropriate medical, dental, and mental health care; removed from a foster home in \n3  which she was receiving exemplary care; and subjected to mental and emotional harm.  In \n4  addition, she has at no time been represented by a guardian ad litem or attorney.  She has had no \n5  legal representation at court hearings, staffings, Child and Family Team meetings, or in any other \n6  decision-making meetings held by DFS at which decisions were made about her placement, \n7  treatment, and/or permanent plan.    \n8  166.  Donna was removed from the custody of her mother and placed in foster care due \n9  to her mother’s addiction to drugs, multiple child molestation allegations her mother had made \n10  against multiple partners, lack of stable living accommodations, her mother’s criminal history \n11  (which included serving four years in federal penitentiary for the sale and possession of cocaine), \n12  and a Florida juvenile court’s removal of Donna’s older sister from her mother’s care and \n13  custody. \n14  167.  In 2005, Donna was returned to her mother on a trial visit with Clark County DFS \n15  retaining legal custody.  Upon information and belief, before Donna was reunited with her \n16  mother, DFS failed to complete a safety and risk assessment.  After Donna’s placement back with \n17  her mother, DFS failed to make regular visits to the home and monitor her care, safety, and well-\n18  being.  Upon information and belief, DFS also failed to provide services to Donna and failed to \n19  continually assess whether her mother had achieved the goals and objectives of the case plan.  \n20  Shortly after Donna was placed back with the mother, her assigned caseworker left or was \n21  reassigned and no other DFS caseworker was assigned to Donna’s case for several months.  By \n22  making this placement change without any safety assessment or monitoring, Defendants greatly \n23  increased the danger to Donna by taking the affirmative step of removing her from a safe \n24  placement and placing her in a dangerous living situation. \n25  168.  While Donna was living with her mother, her mother stole a car, left Nevada with \n26  Donna, and began traveling throughout the United States and Canada.  For three or more months, \n27  Donna lived in the stolen car with her mother and was subjected to a series of traumatizing \n28  events.  Her mother drove from one state to another, evading authorities and engaging in illegal \n  - 40 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 41 of 73\n \n1  conduct including the purchase of illegal drugs.  Donna was often forced to accompany her \n2  mother into truck stop bathrooms in which she witnessed her mother buy, sell, smoke, snort, and \n3  inject drugs.  Donna also endured mental torment and torture.  She was terrorized by her mother’s \n4  paranoia and began herself to believe and participate in it.  For example, she was not permitted to \n5  drink water because her mother was convinced that all water was poisoned by the “cult.”  She \n6  frequently had Donna crawl under the car to look for a global tracking device she believed the \n7  “cult” had put there. \n8  169.  During the months Donna was with her mother, she went without food and water \n9  for long periods of time.  She developed an eating disorder characterized by excessive chewing of \n10  her food, failing to swallow it, and then gagging.  She was confined to the car for long periods of \n11  time and denied exercise and play. \n12  170.  While in the care of her mother, Donna was repeatedly exposed to domestic \n13  violence in which she was often caught in the middle of physical fights between her mother and \n14  her mother’s boyfriend.  From a very early age, Donna’s mother told her that she had been \n15  sexually molested by members of the “cult.”  \n16  171.  As a result of her months of living with a severely emotionally disturbed and drug-\n17  addicted mother, Donna suffered long-lasting harm, the full impact of which is not yet known. \n18  172.  In December 2005, Donna’s mother was arrested in New Mexico and charged with \n19  auto theft.  Law enforcement authorities in New Mexico discovered that Donna was in the \n20  custody of Clark County DFS and made arrangements to have her returned to Las Vegas. \n21  173.  On December 12, 2005, Donna was returned to Las Vegas.  She was taken by a \n22  DFS caseworker from the airport directly to the foster home of Ernest and Jacquelyn Romero.  \n23  When she arrived at the Romero home, she had nothing but a small bag of severely worn clothing \n24  stained with cat urine and feces.  She had no toys, and not even an extra pair of clean underwear. \n25  174.  Since County DFS was not visiting Donna while she was placed with her mother \n26  or otherwise monitoring her care, several months went by before DFS discovered that Donna had \n27  been abducted.  Indeed, DFS first learned that Donna was no longer in Las Vegas when they were \n28  contacted by New Mexico authorities in December 2005. \n  - 41 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 42 of 73\n \n1  175.  Three days before her placement in the Romeros’ home, a Clark County DFS \n2  caseworker contacted them to ask if they would accept Donna.  Although Donna had been in \n3  foster care before her abduction by her mother, DFS provided almost no information about \n4  Donna, other than her age, to the prospective foster parents.  They were told that Donna had no \n5  known behavioral problems or sexual abuse history. \n6  176.  Upon her return to foster care, Donna weighed approximately thirty pounds.  Her \n7  bones were sticking out; she appeared anorexic.  Her muscles were atrophied as a result of sitting \n8  in the car for days at a time. \n9  177.  Despite her physical condition and the trauma she experienced, Donna was denied \n10  medical assistance for services needed to cope with her ordeal. Medicaid-covered services were \n11  requested by her foster parents, but not provided, arranged, or paid for by Defendants.   \n12  178.  In particular, Clark County DFS failed to provide or arrange for the provision of a \n13  comprehensive health and mental health assessment of Donna when she returned to foster care.  \n14  Donna’s caseworker told the foster parents a few days after Donna was placed with them that she \n15  needed a comprehensive assessment, but Clark County DFS did not arrange directly or through \n16  referral to appropriate individuals for such an assessment. Comprehensive health and mental \n17  health assessments are among those services mandated under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A) as \n18  defined in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B) and under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(B).  However, even \n19  after repeated requests, the Romeros did not receive a Medicaid card for Donna until several \n20  months after she was placed in their home.   \n21  179.  Clark County DFS also failed to provide or arrange for health and therapeutic \n22  services, including counseling, medication management and monitoring, and physician and \n23  outpatient services, that were necessary to correct or ameliorate Donna’s health and mental health \n24  conditions, and rehabilitative services required to achieve the maximum reduction of physical or \n25  mental disability and restoration to the best possible functioning.  These services are mandated \n26  under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A) as defined in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), (a)(5)(A), \n27  (a)(2)(A), and (a)(13), as well as under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(C).  Donna needed such  \n28  services to help her cope with the harm caused by months of living with her severely mentally ill \n  - 42 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 43 of 73\n \n1  mother.  Despite her foster parents’ repeated requests for help, she was placed on a waiting list for \n2  several months.  Almost four months elapsed before she was seen by any mental health \n3  professional. \n4  180.  While in the Romero home, Donna flourished and began to recover from the \n5  harms she had suffered while on the road with her mother.  When she came to the Romero home, \n6  Donna did not know her ABCs, or numbers.  With the daily help of the foster mother, Donna \n7  made great strides. \n8  181.  The Romero home is the type of foster home Clark County DFS should retain and \n9  try to replicate, if possible.  The Romeros possess the attributes foster families need to help \n10  children brought into foster care.  The Romeros are licensed as a flex family, meaning they are \n11  dually licensed as an adoptive and foster home.  The Romeros wanted to adopt Donna, and \n12  conveyed this to DFS.  However, they were also prepared to provide her with a stable foster care \n13  home even if adoption was not the placement goal. \n14  182.  On or about April 25, 2006, a hearing was scheduled in the Clark County District \n15  Court to review Donna’s case and to determine, among other things, if a petition to terminate \n16  parental rights should be filed.  Prior to this hearing, Donna’s foster parent sent a letter to the \n17  juvenile court judge presiding over Donna’s case.  In her letter, Mrs. Romero described Donna’s \n18  condition when she arrived at the foster home, their concerns for her safety and well-being, and \n19  the progress she had made since she came to live with them.  She expressed her concerns about \n20  Donna’s safety if returned to her mother, based on Donna’s statements and information that her \n21  mother herself had shared about her drug abuse history.  Finally, she asked the court to consider \n22  revising Donna’s visitation plan to ensure that her mother could not leave town with her again. \n23  183.  On May 4, 2006, Mrs. Romero was summoned to a meeting at Clark County DFS \n24  where for two hours she was confronted and criticized by five members of the DFS staff for \n25  having written a letter to the juvenile court judge in Donna’s case.  Donna’s caseworker was upset \n26  that Mrs. Romero wrote the letter without asking DFS for permission.  The caseworker retaliated \n27  against the Romeros by beginning to plan for Donna’s removal from their home despite the fact \n28  that she was receiving exemplary care. \n  - 43 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 44 of 73\n \n1  184.  For Donna’s birthday, her foster parents were planning a party.  It would have \n2  been the first birthday party Donna had ever had.  They told the caseworker about the party, and \n3  asked that any placement changes of Donna be postponed until at least after her birthday party.  \n4  The worker refused.  She removed Donna from the Romeros’ home ten days after the meeting at \n5  DFS and just before her birthday. \n6  185.  Donna’s therapist advised the County DFS caseworker that removing Donna from \n7  the Romero home would be harmful and detrimental to Donna’s well-being.  During the almost \n8  six months Donna was living with the Romeros, she developed an attachment not only to the \n9  foster parents, but also to their seven- year-old daughter.  As a direct and foreseeable result of the \n10  abrupt, unplanned, and wholly unjustified removal of Donna from the Romero home, she suffered \n11  significant mental distress and emotional harm.     \n12  VII. \n \n13  CLARK COUNTY’S CHILD WELFARE  \nSYSTEM IS DESPERATELY  IN NEED OF REFORM \n14 \n15  186.  Defendants have long known of the urgent need for systemic reform of Nevada’s \n16  child welfare system.  Numerous reports have demonstrated that the system fails to protect and \n17  actually affirmatively harms many of Nevada’s abused and neglected children.  The failures of \n18  Clark County’s child protection and foster care system have been open and notorious for years. \n19  187.  In December 2003, DHHS/DCFS officials submitted a Statewide Assessment of \n20  Child Welfare as part of the federally mandated Child and Family Services Review.  That \n21  assessment begins with state officials’ affirmation that State DCFS “is responsible for … foster \n22  care, adoptions and other child welfare services.”  CFSR Statewide Assessment at 4.  The \n23  Assessment notes deficiencies in Clark County’s child welfare program, including absence of \n24  case plans and infrequent caseworker visits to foster homes. \n25  188.  Between February 2004 and August 2006, local newspapers and television stations \n26  in Las Vegas reported on the child abuse or neglect deaths of more than twenty-four children in \n27  Clark County.  A substantial number of these children were in foster care with Clark County \n28  DFS, had an open child protective services case with DFS at the time of their death, or had a \n  - 44 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 45 of 73\n \n1  history of involvement with child protective services and a case that had been closed by DFS \n2  despite strong indications that the child was at risk. \n3  189.  In 2004, Federal DHHS conducted a performance review of Nevada’s child \n4  welfare system.  The 2004 Federal Review, referred to as a Child and Family Service Review \n5  (“CFSR”), was designed to determine whether Nevada’s child welfare system substantially \n6  complies with the requirements of the “State’s Plan for Title IV-E of the Social Security Act \n7  Foster Care” and meets children’s needs for safety, well-being, and permanency.  During the \n8  CFSR review process, Federal DHHS identified numerous concerns related to Clark County’s \n9  child welfare system, as discussed below. \n10  190.  In October 2005, State DCFS conducted a review of a sample of child welfare \n11  cases from Clark County DFS.  The 2005 County Case Review assessed DFS performance in \n12  protecting child abuse victims and foster children from harm, achieving permanent placements for \n13  them, and promoting their physical and emotional well-being.  The children whose cases were \n14  reviewed included children in foster care and children left in their home after a report of \n15  suspected abuse/neglect.  The case review instrument used by State DCFS was adapted from the \n16  tool used by Federal DHHS for the CFSR in 2004. \n17  191.  In six of the seven outcome measures used to assess Clark County DFS’s \n18  protection and care of children, reviewers found that DFS failed to achieve a minimally \n19  acceptable level of performance.  More specifically, the 2005 County Case Review found that \n20  DFS failed to conduct appropriate assessments prior to removing children from their homes or \n21  returning them to their homes, failed to conduct legally required visits with foster children, failed \n22  to address the educational needs of children in foster care, and failed to ensure that foster children \n23  received needed health care and mental health services. \n24  192.  Many of the findings of the 2005 County Case Review were corroborated by a \n25  more recent review of child abuse cases in Clark County.  In December 2005, after several \n26  meetings with plaintiffs’ counsel, Nevada DHHS began an analysis of Clark County’s alarming \n27  child fatality data.  Based on concerns relating to child welfare practices raised by this \n28  preliminary analysis of fatality data, State DCFS contracted with the National Center for Child \n  - 45 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 46 of 73\n \n1  Death Review to conduct an in-depth study of 79 suspected child abuse/neglect deaths that \n2  occurred between 2001 and 2004.  A panel of child welfare experts from outside Nevada was \n3  hired to manage the review process. \n4  193.  In its 2006 Child Fatality Report, the panel made numerous findings regarding \n5  systemic problems, including: failure to respond to hotline calls promptly, failure to conduct \n6  appropriate safety assessments, and failure to substantiate reports of abuse and neglect that should \n7  have been substantiated.  The panel also identified significant deficiencies relating to case \n8  practices, including: failure to make monthly visits with foster children, failure to provide \n9  children and families with needed services, and failure to prepare service or safety plans for \n10  children and families.  In addition, the panel noted that there was inadequate training for \n11  caseworkers and that the system did not have adequate resources and staffing to meet children’s \n12  needs. \n13  194.  On August 11, 2006, Federal DHHS took the unusual step of informing the State \n14  of Nevada that it intended to renegotiate the State’s Program Improvement Plan due to worsening \n15  conditions for abused and neglected children in Clark County.  Federal DHHS’s rationale for \n16  taking this step included that there were “[s]erious deficiencies in the State’s child welfare \n17  program, most specifically Clark County” and that there was “[c]onsistent overcrowding at Child \n18  Haven and recent tragedies involving children in foster care.”  August 11, 2006 Letter from \n19  Sharon M. Fujii to Defendant Willden.  Federal DHHS further stated that “the manner in which \n20  the continuum of child welfare services is managed in Clark County should be a grave concern to \n21  the State and should be addressed by the State in its administration and supervision of the \n22  program.”  Id.  The letter demanded revisions in the State’s Program Improvement Plan “that \n23  specifically address the ongoing concerns regarding Clark County.” Id. \n24  195.  Subsequently, Defendants Willden and Serrano wrote a letter to Defendant Morton  \n25  acknowledging that “many hours have been directed towards several efforts in hopes of \n26  improvement [in Clark County’s child welfare system.].”  August 30, 2006 letter from \n27  Defendants Willden and Serrano to Defendant Morton.  The letter further stated that:  \n28 \n  - 46 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 47 of 73\n \n1  we continue to receive information indicating serious deficiencies \nwith the [child welfare] system …; the existing level of effort to \n2  correct system deficiencies is not adequate; [and] that despite lists \nof corrective action plans … still we have major failures. \n3 \n4  Id.  Defendants’ letter underscores State Defendants’ knowledge of and concern about the serious \n5  failures in Clark County’s child welfare system. \n6  196.  On August 31, 2006, Defendant Willden responded to Federal DHHS, describing a \n7  number of steps that State Defendants were taking to improve Clark County’s compliance with \n8  federal child welfare mandates.  August 31, 2006 Letter from State Defendant Willden to Sharon \n9  Fujii.  He refers to plans developed for compliance with Title IV-E and the CAPTA.  Id.  Implicit \n10  in this correspondence is Defendant Willden’s concession that Nevada DHHS and State DCFS \n11  are responsible for ensuring Clark County’s compliance with federal laws.    \n12  A.  Abused and neglected children in Clark County are placed in an unlicensed, \novercrowded, and unsafe facility for extended periods of time \n13 \n14  197.  Defendants’ failure to recruit, train, support, and retain a sufficient number of \n15  foster homes has resulted in over reliance on Child Haven, a large, unlicensed congregate care \n16  facility in Las Vegas.  Nearly all children who have been removed from the homes of their \n17  parents because of suspected abuse or neglect are first taken to Child Haven.  Children frequently \n18  are forced to stay at Child Haven for long periods of time because there are no available beds at \n19  foster family shelter homes.    \n20  198.  Upon admission to Child Haven, children are stripped of their clothes and all \n21  personal belongings.  Throughout their stay at Child Haven, children are not permitted to wear \n22  their own clothes – not even their own underwear – but are periodically issued clothes and shoes \n23  from a communal pile of clothing.  Oftentimes the clothes and shoes do not fit, and may not even \n24  match the child’s gender.    \n25  199.  Children placed at Child Haven are forced to live in overcrowded buildings where \n26  they sometimes sleep on the floor, are not provided with the health, educational or therapeutic \n27  services they need, and often act out their justifiable rage at being treated neglectfully.  Their \n28 \n  - 47 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 48 of 73\n \n1  basic emotional needs are not met and they are not given even basic information about the plans \n2  the agency has for them. \n3  200.  Child Haven is an unsafe place for children.  A growing number of children with \n4  significant behavioral and emotional/mental health problems are placed at Child Haven without \n5  adequate therapeutic services to meet their needs. In addition, older teens, some with a history of \n6  delinquent behavior, reside on the same campus, in close proximity to and sharing some common \n7  areas with toddlers and elementary school age children. \n8  201.  For years, Defendants have failed to address the problem of runaways from Child \n9  Haven.  Some youth are allowed to “walk away” from the facility when behaviors escalate to a \n10  point that staff determine that it is in the best interests of other children at Child Haven that they \n11  be allowed to run away.  While on runaway, these youth have engaged in dangerous, sometimes \n12  life-threatening behaviors.  During August 2006, a youth who had run away seven times from \n13  Child Haven was murdered on the streets of Las Vegas.  Clark County DFS has done little to \n14  address the chronic problem of runaways from Child Haven thus placing children and youth at \n15  substantial risk of harm. \n16  202.  In 2004, federal reviewers found that “there is no monitoring or oversight process \n17  for Child Haven.”  This finding and the continued operation of Child Haven without a license, \n18  they concluded, was a violation of federal mandates that the State of Nevada develop and \n19  implement standards to ensure that children in foster care are provided with quality services that \n20  protect the safety and health of children. \n21  203.  Following another site visit by federal officials to Child Haven in the summer of \n22  2006, federal officials notified Defendants that “the situation (at Child Haven and within other \n23  parts of Clark County’s child welfare system) had worsened since the on-site visit” in February \n24  2004.  Federal officials concluded that “immediate and ongoing attention” was needed to ensure \n25  the safety, permanency, and well-being of children placed at Child Haven. \n26  204.  During the last couple of years, a number of factors have compounded the \n27  inevitable risk and harm to children admitted to Child Haven.  The problems resulting from \n28  chronic, increasingly severe overcrowding are exacerbated by the admission of children and \n  - 48 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 49 of 73\n \n1  youth with ever more serious and challenging behaviors, the agency practice of compelling staff \n2  from other sections of the agency to work overtime at the buildings, the use of untrained \n3  volunteers, and the failure to provide children with the necessary assessments and therapeutic \n4  interventions to meet their needs. \n5  205.  Federal law forbids the use of federal funds for institutions caring for more than \n6  twenty-five children.  As a result, Clark County does not receive any federal funds to defray the \n7  $9 million per year that it costs to support the 6,000 children that pass through or reside at Child \n8  Haven in a year.  Despite this fact, federal officials notified Nevada that “[w]hile Child Haven \n9  placements are not eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement, the children placed in this unlicensed \n10  congregate facility are the responsibility of the State of Nevada not just Clark County.”   \n11  206.  Current social science research provides substantial evidence that the care children \n12  and youth receive in group care and shelters like Child Haven is far more expensive and less \n13  beneficial than care provided in foster family homes.  As Richard Barth, the current Dean of the \n14  School of Social Work at the University of Maryland wrote recently, “[c]ounties across the \n15  United States have been closing child welfare shelters – at times, as a result of court orders – but \n16  mostly because it is humane and cost effective…The money [spent to operate large shelters like \n17  Child Haven] could be more effectively spent in recruiting and providing training and support for \n18  foster caregivers.” \n19  1.  Child Haven has been chronically overcrowded for years \n20  207.  Child Haven was designed to be a temporary shelter while children await \n21  placement with their relatives or in a more family-like setting.  Child Haven’s campus consists of \n22  eight buildings and an on-grounds school.  One building is used for visits between parents and \n23  children and/or administrative purposes; it is not used to house children.  Each of the seven \n24  buildings used to house children has a capacity for 12 children except for the infants’ building, \n25  which has a capacity for 20 infants.  Accordingly, Child Haven currently has a total capacity for \n26  92 infants, children, and youth. \n27  208.  Despite its large size, Child Haven is chronically overcrowded, with many of the \n28  buildings housing more than twelve children.  Overcrowding has been tolerated for years.  For all \n  - 49 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 50 of 73\n \n1  but a few months since January 2003, the number of children housed at Child Haven has \n2  exceeded capacity.  The average daily population has been as high as 160 children or higher, and \n3  has frequently been 146 or higher.  \n4  209.  The overcrowding at Child Haven has worsened since October 2005, most recently \n5  reaching more than 220 infants, children, and youth.  Overcrowding in the Agassi building – \n6  reserved for a maximum of twenty newborns and infants – is endemic.  During the first week of \n7  April 2006, there were 56 infants in several buildings at Child Haven. \n8  210.  In recent months the situation has become so dire that the staff lunch room was \n9  converted into an annex for infants.  Cribs were stacked one against the other in a room not \n10  intended or designed for the care of infants. \n11  211.  Overcrowding at Child Haven is not limited to the infant and toddler buildings.  \n12  On December 9, during a “special evening inspection” of Child Haven by the Clark County \n13  Health Department, the inspector noted overcrowding in the Bigelow building.  The Bigelow \n14  building is for boys between the ages of five and ten.  Instead of the usual 18 children, on that \n15  evening there were 26 children being housed in the building.  Several children had no bedroom, \n16  and were forced to sleep on the floors of the common areas of the building.  These children slept \n17  on mats placed on the floor. \n18  212.  Most recently, the federal government weighed in on the chronic overcrowding at \n19  Child Haven.  As of June 30, 2006, there were 205 children living at Child Haven, over half of \n20  whom were between the ages of 0-4.  Federal DHHS stressed the need to develop immediate \n21  strategies to address this and other problems at Child Haven. \n22  2.  Conditions at Child Haven endanger children and do not promote their well-being \n23  213.  Overcrowding at Child Haven has contributed to and exacerbated the frequency \n24  and severity of outbreaks of infectious and communicable diseases among the children placed \n25  there.  On August 1, 2005, the Clark County Health Department reported an outbreak of hand-\n26  foot-mouth disease.  A September 30, 2005 Health Department survey reported a concern of \n27  possible Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among children in Child Haven.  \n28  On that occasion, a two-year-old boy was found to have an MRSA infection of the eye and a 10-\n  - 50 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 51 of 73\n \n1  month-old girl suffered an infection on her buttocks.  The boy was taken to Sunrise Hospital for a \n2  culture to determine if the suspected infection was MRSA, but was returned to the Child Haven \n3  building before the culture results were obtained thus exposing other children to the risk of \n4  infection. \n5  214.  In addition to these health concerns, there are also no standards in place to ensure \n6  that children’s health, mental health, and educational needs are met.  No individual assessments \n7  of children’s needs are conducted while they are placed at Child Haven, and as a result, their \n8  treatment needs go unidentified and neglected and informed decision-making to select the child’s \n9  next placement does not occur. \n10  215.  Clark County DFS considers Child Haven to be a temporary placement even \n11  though many children stay for weeks, months, and years at a time.  Because of the purported \n12  short-term nature of the placement, DFS does not arrange for or provide services for many of the \n13  children in need of special treatment and services. \n14  216.  Children who are discharged from Child Haven are not prepared for what is ahead.  \n15  A child is given little or no explanation of where they are being placed and who will be their next \n16  caregiver.  They are given no opportunity to meet the caregiver before being abruptly transferred \n17  to the next placement.  They have no voice in the selection of the placement.    \n18  3.  Placement of infants and toddlers at Child Haven is harmful, contrary to the \noverwhelming opinion of mental heath, child development and child welfare \n19  experts, and contrary to federal and state mandates \n20  217.  Infants entering foster care have very high rates of risk factors for \n21  psychopathology, medical illnesses, and developmental delays, and consequently have extensive \n22  service needs.  Sixty to eighty percent of young children entering care have at least one medical \n23  illness and twenty-five percent have three or more chronic conditions.  As many as three-quarters \n24  of young children in placement need further developmental evaluation or have a developmental \n25  delay. \n26  218.  Infants and toddlers, in particular, are most susceptible to long-term detrimental \n27  effects as a result of placement, even for relatively short periods of time, in institutions.  The first \n28 \n  - 51 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 52 of 73\n \n1  three years of a child’s life are the most critical period for brain development, as this is the time \n2  when the brain is in an unparalleled time of developmental change. \n3  219.  Infants and toddlers need the presence of a primary caregiver to form an \n4  attachment to in order to develop normal emotional bonds and socialization skills.  Having \n5  already suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect by a primary caregiver, they have an even \n6  greater need for a stable, nurturing, individual caregiver. \n7  220.  Children in Child Haven end up interacting with a multiple shift-work staff.  At \n8  Child Haven, infants and young children receive care from an ever-changing and large number of \n9  different caretakers, which is contrary to their well-being and harmful to their development.  \n10  There is no one person who provides consistent care for each infant.  It is estimated that in a \n11  week, an infant may have as many as twenty different caregivers.  Staff, though well-meaning, \n12  are simply unable to respond to each child’s individual cues and unable to attend to each child’s \n13  individual needs.  Shelter care institutions like Child Haven tend to be more concerned with the \n14  children’s physical care and establishment of routine, rather than the development of appropriate \n15  social interaction, language development, and autonomy. \n16  221.  The placement of infants and toddlers in Child Haven is at odds with the mandate \n17  of federal law that children in foster care must be placed in the least restrictive, most family like \n18  setting consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child. \n19  222.  Placement of infants and toddlers in Child Haven runs counter to the \n20  overwhelming opinion of experts in the field of child welfare, infant mental health, and child \n21  development.  It is also against the overwhelming weight of current social science and infant \n22  mental health research.  That research confirms that children living in institutions like Child \n23  Haven tend to suffer from motor and language delays and display a lack of attachment and sense \n24  of trust, a restricted range of emotion expressions, and an absence of social play.  In comparison \n25  to children placed in foster family homes, these children show poorer development and social \n26  emotional functioning. \n27  223.  Clark County DFS’s practice of placing infants at Child Haven also is inconsistent \n28  with its own determination, as stated in a 2004 Clark County Audit Department report, that \n  - 52 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 53 of 73\n \n1  “based on research … infants and small toddlers under 3 years of age … have been shown to do \n2  better in a home with consistency in their caregivers versus those placed in an institution.”   \n3  4.  Children remain housed at Child Haven for months and sometimes years \n4  224.  Child Haven is intended to be a short-term placement for children taken into \n5  custody.  Clark County DFS policy specifies that children are not to be placed in the shelter for \n6  longer than two weeks.  Despite this policy, many children, including infants and toddlers, remain \n7  in Child Haven for long periods of time. \n8  225.  In 2004, community stakeholders interviewed as part of the federal CFSR \n9  expressed concerns about the number of infants and very young children who are placed in Child \n10  Haven and who remain in the shelter for long periods of time. \n11  226.  As of June 2006, the average length of stay was 45 days, with many children \n12  remaining at Child Haven for three to six months, and sometimes a year or longer.  According to \n13  Federal DHHS, one child had been living in Child Haven for over two years. \n14  5.  Child Haven operates without the required license \n \n15 \n227.  Although Nevada law requires all child care facilities operating in the state to \n16 \nobtain a license from the appropriate government agency before accepting children, Child Haven \n17 \nhas operated for years without a license.  Child Haven as also never complied with the licensing \n18 \nstandards and regulations for child care facilities established by Las Vegas and the State of \n19 \nNevada.   \n20 \n228.  More than two years ago, as part of a federal CFSR, reviewers noted that Child \n21 \nHaven operated without the necessary license.  State and County Defendants were directed as part \n22 \nof the State’s Program Improvement Plan to ensure that Child Haven met all applicable licensing \n23 \nrequirements.  A deadline of January 31, 2006, was established for compliance with this provision \n24 \nof the PIP.  Child Haven was not licensed as of January 31, 2006, and continues to operate in \n25 \nviolation of the applicable licensing statutes, regulations, and standards.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  - 53 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 54 of 73\n \n1  6.  Staffing and training at Child Haven are woefully inadequate \n2  229.  Buildings at Child Haven are staffed by a combination of full-time employees, \n3  part-time staff, temporary employees, and volunteers.  “Child Development Specialists” staff \n4  each of the buildings working in three shifts around the clock. \n5  230.  Direct care staff receives a mere two days of training in what the agency calls the \n6  Child Haven Active Teaching Treatment Approach (CHATTA).  During what amounts to no \n7  more than twelve hours of actual training, staff receive half-hour segments on such subjects as \n8  principles of behavior, relationship building, youth rights, and working with the school.  \n9  Furthermore, the CHATTA model has little or no empirical basis and its use with all age groups \n10  of children is inappropriate. \n11  231.  The number and qualifications of staff at Child Haven are inadequate to ensure the \n12  care, protection, and well-being of children at the facility.  Overcrowding at Child Haven has led \n13  to requests and/or demands from the DFS director that other DFS staff not employed at Child \n14  Haven volunteer for duty at Child Haven.  Clark County DFS caseworkers who are encouraged or \n15  coerced into volunteering to staff Child Haven are not trained in the care or supervision of the \n16  infants, children, and youth at the facility, thus placing those children at risk. \n17  B.  Defendants’ failure to conduct proper child abuse and neglect investigations and \nmake reasonable efforts to keep children safely at home is harmful to children \n18 \n19  232.  Multiple studies of casework practices in Clark County have indicated that DFS is \n20  failing to conduct adequate investigations of allegations of child abuse and neglect. \n21  233.  In the October 2005 County Case Review conducted by State DCFS, the reviewers \n22  found that children were removed from home without conducting a safety assessment to \n23  determine whether they could remain safely at home with the provision of supervision and \n24  services to the family.  The review also found that Clark County DFS failed to conduct ongoing \n25  safety and risk assessments to monitor children left in their homes. \n26  234.  These findings were reinforced in the 2006 Child Fatality Report prepared by the \n27  National Center for Child Death Review.  The panel concluded that Clark County DFS has failed \n28  to investigate numerous child deaths despite evidence of substance abuse, prior substantiations, \n  - 54 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 55 of 73\n \n1  significant neglect, and lack of supervision; failed to perform timely safety assessments relating \n2  to other children living in the home following a child death; and failed to substantiate numerous \n3  reports of abuse and neglect that should have been substantiated.  The panel also found that DFS \n4  failed to respond to hotline calls promptly, leaving some callers on hold for over 55 minutes and \n5  resulting in 27% dropped calls. \n6  235.  Based on the federal Program Improvement Plan review and a recent on-site visit \n7  to Clark County, Federal DHHS again echoed findings in previous reports of severe problems \n8  with CPS investigations in Clark County.  Federal DHHS concluded that Clark County does not \n9  have a 24 hour, seven day a week Child Protective Services Response team, which results in \n10  many children being unnecessarily removed by law enforcement and taken directly to Child \n11  Haven.  Children who are removed from their homes by law enforcement are not provided with a \n12  safety or family risk assessment.  Moreover, Federal DHHS noted that employees staffing the \n13  child abuse hotline have been deployed by the shelters to handle shelter intake, resulting in even \n14  longer waits and hotline calls going unanswered. \n15  236.  Child abuse investigations often are not completed within a reasonable time thus \n16  placing children who are the subject of such reports and their siblings at tremendous risk. In \n17  recent months, there have been more than 340 investigations that are still pending and unresolved \n18  more than 45 days after the initial report of suspected abuse or neglect was received by Clark \n19  County DFS. \n20  237.  In addition to inadequate investigations, Clark County DFS has also failed to make \n21  reasonable efforts to ensure that families receive services that would allow children to remain \n22  safely in their homes.  Federal DHHS has found that “there is an inadequate array of services to \n23  prevent placement by providing in-home family support services that are integrated and facilitate \n24  the ability of children to remain in their own homes or return home in a timely manner.” August \n25  11, 2006 Letter from Sharon M. Fujii to Defendant Willden.  \n26  238.  Nevada’s Court Improvement Program workgroups have also identified the overall \n27  lack of services as a significant problem, and identified three areas in which services are \n28  particularly needed: substance abuse, mental health, and developmental delays.  Courts in Nevada \n  - 55 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 56 of 73\n \n1  have begun levying fines on State and county agencies for failing to provide children and families \n2  with needed court-ordered services. \n3 \nC.  Defendants fail to place children in safe, appropriate, stable foster home placements \nand supervise and support those placements \n4 \n5  239.  Defendants’ over-reliance on Child Haven is fueled, in part, by their failure to \n6  recruit an array of suitable foster homes to meet the needs of Nevada’s abused and neglected \n7  children. \n8  240.  Clark County DFS also fails to follow up on foster and adoptive parent inquiries \n9  from its own recruitment campaigns.  A recent recruitment campaign received 1,340 inquiries, \n10  but only resulted in 24 new foster homes.  Many inquiries from prospective foster parents were \n11  not pursued in a timely manner. \n12  241.  Clark County DFS has failed to devote the staff and other resources necessary to \n13  recruit, train, and retain an adequate number of foster parents to meet the needs of children in \n14  foster care.  Clark County has only one full-time foster parent recruiter and one foster parent \n15  trainer.  Washoe County, with one-fourth the number of children in foster care, has three full-time \n16  recruiters and three full-time trainers.  Clark County DFS continues to employ the same \n17  recruitment strategies from year to year with the same poor results. \n18  242.  Due to the shortage of foster homes, children are often placed wherever an open \n19  bed exists, rather than in homes that meet their needs.  Little effort is made to assess children’s \n20  needs before placing them in a foster home or to match them with a foster parent who has the \n21  appropriate skills or training.  To make matters worse, caseworkers often fail to provide foster \n22  parents with information that is crucial to ensuring foster children’s safety, health, and well-\n23  being. \n24  243.  Some children have been placed with foster families that are taking care of more \n25  children than allowed by their license permits.  Clark County DFS frequently grants waivers in \n26  order to place more children in the foster home than the foster parents’ license permits. \n27  244.  Once children are placed in foster homes, they are often all but forgotten.  Foster \n28  parents are not provided adequate support or training, and are frequently left to fend for \n  - 56 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 57 of 73\n \n1  themselves under challenging circumstances.  This lack of support results in failed foster \n2  placements and increased instability for foster children.  Worsening the effects of the traumatic \n3  experiences they encountered prior to entering foster care, foster children are re-traumatized by \n4  frequent placement disruptions. \n5  245.  Caseworkers fail to make the requisite visits with children to ensure that their \n6  needs are being met.  Clark County DFS’s own study found that in almost two-thirds of cases, \n7  case workers failed to visit their clients as required by law.  Federal reviewers found that in more \n8  than 40% of Clark County cases, the frequency of visits between caseworker and children was \n9  insufficient to ensure adequate monitoring of the child’s safety and well-being. \n10  246.  The federal performance review of Nevada’s child welfare system found that only \n11  31 percent of foster children in the Clark County had stable placements.  Many of the children \n12  experiencing multiple placements in Clark County were under five years of age.  Frequent \n13  changes in placement led to a lack of continuity in services, changes in schools, and an overall \n14  negative impact on children’s well-being. \n15  247.  Federal reviewers found that chronic widespread disruptions in foster children’s \n16  placements are due to a lack of supports for foster families, failure to provide foster parents with \n17  sufficient information about a child prior to placement to ensure that the family is able to meet the \n18  child’s needs, insufficient mental health resources for children, and a lack of an array of \n19  placements to permit the matching of a child’s needs with the skills, knowledge, and abilities of \n20  the foster caregiver. \n21  D.  Defendants fail to provide abused and neglected children with timely medical care, \nmental health care, and educational services necessary to meet their needs \n22 \n23  248.  Federal and State law require Defendants to provide foster children with medical \n24  assistance to meet their medical, dental, and mental health needs and to arrange and provide for \n25  screening and treatment services through EPSDT.  Given the neglectful and chaotic environments \n26  foster youth often grow up in, it is crucial that they receive prompt assessments and medically \n27  necessary services. \n28 \n  - 57 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 58 of 73\n \n1  249.  Moreover, studies have shown that a high percentage of foster children have \n2  significant mental health problems.  Mental health experts agree that children with serious mental \n3  health problems require an array of individualized services tailored to address their needs.  Such \n4  services should include professionally acceptable assessments, behavioral support and case \n5  management services, family support, crisis support, wraparound services, therapeutic foster care, \n6  and other mental health services, in a home-like setting. \n7 \n250.  The 2005 County Case Review found that Clark County DFS fails to assess the \n8 \nmental health and health needs of 50% of the children in care.  For those children who do receive \n9 \nsome sort of assessment, DFS fails to ensure that physical and mental health services are being \n10 \nprovided. \n11 \n251.  The 2006 Child Fatality Report also found that DFS fails to provide children and \n12 \nfamilies with services needed to resolve identified issues.  DFS fails to complete service plans for \n13 \nchildren or to document or follow-up on referrals for services. \n14 \n252.  In addition, DFS does not ensure that children with mental health needs receive  \n15 \nindividualized treatment that addresses their needs.  There is a severe lack of mental health \n16 \nservices such as behavioral support, psychiatric and other clinical services, case management \n17 \nservices, therapeutic foster care services provided in a home-like setting, and wraparound \n18 \nservices. \n19 \n253.  Nevada law also requires foster placements to ensure that foster children attend \n20 \nschool full-time; are provided with appropriate educational assessments and services; receive an \n21 \nappropriate education, including special education services or training programs, as needed; and \n22 \nare afforded an opportunity to complete schooling or training in accordance with their aptitude. \n23 \n254.  Despite these requirements, Federal DHHS has found that foster children’s \n24 \neducational needs were being woefully neglected.  DFS fails to obtain copies of school records \n25 \nfor children in foster care; fails to obtain copies of the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for \n26 \nchildren receiving special education services and to provide such information to foster parents; \n27 \nand fails to advocate for children’s educational needs in the school system. \n28 \n  - 58 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 59 of 73\n \n1  E.  Caseworkers’ high caseloads, inadequate training, and poor supervision threaten the \nsafety and well-being of Nevada’s abused and neglected children \n2 \n3  255.  A well-trained, experienced, and adequately staffed workforce is a vital \n4  component of any child welfare system.  When caseworkers are overwhelmed, untrained, and \n5  poorly supervised, the child welfare system inevitably breaks down, resulting in reasonably \n6  foreseeable harm to foster children.  Unfortunately, Clark County’s system is lacking in each of \n7  these important workforce areas. \n8  256.  High caseloads are prevalent among Clark County DFS caseworkers and are \n9  among the highest in the state.  In February 2005, the average caseload for DFS caseworkers was \n10  1:35. \n11  257.  DFS staff caseloads are significantly higher than the caseload ratio required for \n12  accreditation by the Council on Accreditation, which is no greater than 1:18.  They also far \n13  exceed the caseload ratios established by Child Welfare League of America Standards, which are \n14  between 1:12 and 1:15. \n15  258.  As a direct result of the high caseloads of workers within Clark County DFS, \n16  investigations of reports of abuse are not initiated promptly nor completed within 30 days, \n17  investigations fail to comply with minimum standards required of such investigations, monthly \n18  visits to foster homes are not conducted, and children are harmed or at grave risk of harm. \n19  259.  Caseworkers receive only minimal training prior to working with children and \n20  families.  As a result, they are ill-prepared to perform the duties and responsibilities assigned to \n21  them and fail to exercise professional judgment when making life and death decisions for \n22  children. \n23  260.  During the 2004 federal CFSR, federal reviewers found that many caseworkers do \n24  not complete required ongoing in-service training.  Although Washoe County and the rural areas \n25  of the state require that workers must be licensed, Clark County does not.  Even staff assigned to \n26  investigate abuse reports are not licensed. \n27  261.  The Child Fatality Study found that DFS fails to make monthly contact with \n28  children and family who have open cases and follow-up appropriately; fails to resolve problems \n  - 59 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 60 of 73\n \n1  or concerns prior to closing cases; fails to complete service or safety plans for children and \n2  families; and fails to provide case workers with appropriate training. \n3  262.  The 2006 Child Fatality Report found that County DFS caseworkers consistently \n4  fail to document critical information.  Case files lacked documentation of investigative contacts, \n5  family background checks, progress toward case goals, the basis for safety decisions, the nature \n6  and purpose of service referrals, and contact with service providers to ascertain progress.  The \n7  study found that such poor documentation practices serve as a major barrier to future quality \n8  assurance efforts, and could represent a critical weakness in the overall safety net. \n9  F.  Defendants fail to ensure that abused and neglected children have a voice in court \nproceedings \n10 \n11  263.  Approximately half of all children and youth who are the subject of abuse and \n12  neglect proceedings in Clark County are not represented by a guardian ad litem in those \n13  proceedings. \n14  264.  Children who are the subject of abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark County \n15  are, if provided with any representation at all, represented either by the Children’s Advocacy \n16  Project (CAP) of Clark County Legal Services or Las Vegas Court Appointed Special Advocates \n17  (CASA).  On occasion a child may have both an attorney and CASA. \n18  265.  CAP employs six attorneys, each of whom represents 40 to 50 children.  \n19  Consequently, on average, no more than 300 out of the 3,000 children in foster care in Clark \n20  County are represented by an attorney.  Upon information and belief, CAP attorneys do not act as \n21  guardians ad litem for the children or youth they are appointed to represent. \n22  266.  There are about 200 CASAs in Clark County.  In 2005, they represented 480 \n23  children, and they reported that they had to turn away 89 children who were referred by the court. \n24  267.  Neither CAP nor CASA represent children at the earliest stages of the proceedings, \n25  including proceedings to determine if children should be taken into or remain in initial protective \n26  custody. \n27  268.  The lack of representation for child abuse and neglect victims in Clark County \n28  District Court proceedings has been known to Defendants and tolerated for years. \n  - 60 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 61 of 73\n \n1  269.  In January 2006, Chief Justice Rose of the Nevada Supreme Court acknowledged \n2  that “[w]e need more attorneys and CASA volunteers to assist children.” \n3  270.  Clark County Family Court Judge Gerald Hardcastle has admitted that over half of \n4  all children and youth who are the subject of abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark County \n5  District Court are unrepresented in the proceedings. \n6  271.  During the entire time that children and youth have gone unrepresented in child \n7  abuse and neglect proceedings in Clark County District Court, State DCFS has received and \n8  continues to receive funds under the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. \n9  272.  The failure to provide children and youth with representation in the juvenile court \n10  leads to ill-informed decisions and inhibits the court’s obligation to oversee the child’s placement, \n11  care, and treatment while in foster care. \n12  VIII. \n \n13  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION– \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS UNDER THE UNITED  \n14  STATES CONSTITUTION (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n15  273.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n16  274.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants Willden, Serrano, Doe, Morton, \n17  Valentine, County Commissioners, and Clark County constitute a failure to meet the affirmative \n18  duty to protect all plaintiffs from harm, which is a substantial factor leading to, and proximate \n19  cause of, the violation of the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all \n20  plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.4  \n21  275.  The foregoing actions and inaction of these Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \n22  practice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of reasonable professional judgment \n23  in violation of the constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of all \n24  plaintiffs.  As a result, all plaintiffs have been and are being deprived of the substantive due \n25  process rights conferred upon them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n26  Constitution. \n27 \n                                                 \n28  4 As noted above, all individually named Defendants are being sued in their official capacities. \n  - 61 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 62 of 73\n \n1  276.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right to \n2  protection from unnecessary harm while in government custody; the right to a living environment \n3  that protects foster children’s physical, mental, and emotional safety and well-being; the right to \n4  services necessary to prevent foster children from deteriorating or being harmed physically, \n5  developmentally, psychologically, or otherwise while in government custody, including but not \n6  limited to the right to safe and secure foster care placements, appropriate monitoring and \n7  supervision, appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuing that the child can leave \n8  foster care and grow up in a permanent family, adequate mental, dental, psychiatric, \n9  psychological, and educational services; the right to treatment and care consistent with the \n10  purpose of the assumption of custody by Defendants; the right not to be retained in custody \n11  longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes to be served by taking the child into custody; \n12  the right to be placed in the least restrictive placement based on the foster child’s needs; and the \n13  right to receive care, treatment, and services determined and provided through the exercise of \n14  accepted, reasonable professional judgment. \n15  IX. \n \n16  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION– \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION:  \n17  STATE CREATED DANGER CLAIM (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n18  277.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n19  278.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants Willden, Serrano, Morton, \n20  Valentine, Palma, County Commissioners, and Clark County amount to a pattern, practice, and \n21  custom of failure to exercise reasonable professional judgment in violation of the constitutional \n22  rights of all plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   Defendants are engaging in a \n23  pattern and practice of violating plaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause of the United \n24  States Constitution, by affirmatively moving them from safe placements and putting them in \n25  placements that Defendants know or should know pose an imminent risk of harm to these \n26  children, in disregard of the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.  By doing so, \n27  Defendants greatly increase the danger to plaintiffs. \n28 \n  - 62 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 63 of 73\n \n1  X. \n \n2  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION– \nPROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO \n3  THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n4  279.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n5  280.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants Willden, Serrano, Doe, Morton, \n6  Valentine, County Commissioners, and Clark County constitute a failure to exercise an \n7  affirmative duty to protect the welfare of all plaintiffs, which is a substantial factor leading to, and \n8  proximate cause of, the violation of the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of \n9  all plaintiffs, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n10  281.  The foregoing actions and inactions of these Defendants constitute a policy, \n11  pattern, practice and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of reasonable professional \n12  judgment and violates the constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of all \n13  plaintiffs.  As a result, all plaintiffs are being deprived of federally created and state-created \n14  liberty or property rights without due process of law.  The state law entitlements to which \n15  children have a constitutionally protected interest include the following: \n16  (a)  The entitlements arising from Nev. Rev. Stat.

Parts 1355-1357, as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  These rights granted to \n5  individual foster children include, but are not limited to: \n6  (a)  The right to placement in foster homes or other settings that conform to \n7  national professional standards and are subject to a uniformly applied set of \n8  standards.  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10). \n9  (b)  The right to quality services that protect foster children’s safety and health.  \n10  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22). \n11  (c)  The right of each child to have a written case plan, containing specified \n12  elements, the right to have services provided in accordance with that plan, \n13  and the right to have the status of her case reviewed no less than every six \n14  months in order to determine, among other things, the safety of the child \n15  and the extent of compliance with the case plan.  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), \n16  675(1), 675(5)(B). \n17  (d)  The right to placement in a safe setting that is the least restrictive and most \n18  family like setting, consistent with the best interest and special needs of the \n19  child.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii), 675(5)(A). \n20  (e)  The right to have health and educational records reviewed, updated, and a \n21  copy supplied to foster parents or foster care providers with whom the \n22  child is placed at the time of placement.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii), \n23  675(5)(D). \n24  (f)  The right to have the foster parents and any pre-adoptive parent or relative \n25  providing care to the child present at any proceeding held with respect to \n26  the child as a matter of right.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii), 675(5)(G). \n27  (g)  All other rights created by 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) and 675(5). \n28 \n  - 65 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 66 of 73\n \n1  XII. \n \n2  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION– \nVIOLATION OF RIGHT TO GUARDIAN AD LITEM PURSUANT TO CHILD ABUSE \n3  PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT (ASSERTED PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n4  284.  Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n5  285.  As a result of the foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants Willden, Serrano, \n6  Morton, Valentine, County Commissioners, and Clark County, plaintiffs have been deprived of \n7  their right to a guardian ad litem in all proceedings before the juvenile court in violation of 42 \n8  U.S.C. § 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii), as asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, causing serious injury \n9  and harm. \n10  XIII. \n \n11  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION– \nEARLY PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND  \n12  TREATMENT  PROGRAM (“EPSDT”) OF THE MEDICAID ACT  \n(42 U.S.C. 1396 ET SEQ.)

By their actions described herein, Defendants Willden, Serrano, Morton, \n15 \nValentine, County Commissioners, and Clark County have failed and continue to fail to provide \n16 \nmedical assistance as required under 42 U.S.C.§ 1396a(a)(10)(A).  Defendants Willden, Serrano, \n17 \nMorton, Valentine, County Commissioners, and Clark County have also failed to provide or \n18 \narrange for necessary EPSDT services for plaintiffs, which are required to treat or ameliorate their \n19 \nmental or physical conditions, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(43), \n20 \n1396d(a)(4)(B), and 1396d(r).   \n21 \n288.

The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants amount to a pattern, practice, \n2  and custom of failure to exercise reasonable professional judgment in violation of the \n3  constitutional procedural due process rights of plaintiffs, and are the cause of the violation of such \n4  rights.

Each and every allegation is incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n23 \n299.  Under Titles IV-B, IV-E, and XIX of the Social Security Act, states receive certain \n24 \nfederal reimbursements so long as they enter into plans approved by Federal DHHS and comply \n25 \nwith their terms.  The State of Nevada receives federal funding under Titles IV-B, IV-E, and XIX \n26 \nof the Social Security Act and has submitted such plans, which are legal contracts between the \n27 \nfederal government and the state.  In these State Plan contracts, the state agrees to provide child \n28 \n  - 70 -  21433\\1274718.2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (CLASS ACTION ALLEGED) \n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 142   Filed 06/14/07   Page 71 of 73\n \n1  welfare, foster care, adoption, and health services to plaintiffs in accordance with specific statutes \n2  and policies and all applicable federal regulations and other official issuances of Federal DHHS. \n3  300.

The Court, has considered the Motions (#119)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 186   Filed 03/12/08   Page 2 of 6\n1  and (#120), Declaration of Leecia Welch in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Entry of Protective\n2 Order (#116), Plaintiffs’ Response (#126), Defendants’ Opposition (#125), Defendants’ Reply\n3 (#131), and Plaintiffs’ Reply (#129).\n4\n5 BACKGROUND\n6 This case arises from a civil action filed on August 30, 2006, by the plaintiffs, on behalf\n7 of themselves and “all abused and neglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark\n8 County foster care system,” alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Plaintiffs’ seek declaratory\n9 and injunctive relief relating to the operation of Nevada and Clark County’s foster care system.\n10 The defendants have filed a Renewed Motion for Protection from Disclosure of\n11 Confidential Information (#120).1  The parties have met and conferred regarding the applicability\n12 of the Nevada Revised Statute, but were unable to resolve the issue without Court intervention. \n13 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Protective Order (#119) on March 5, 2007.  The dispute in both\n14 motions involves the agreement on an appropriate protective order to safeguard the privacy rights\n15 of foster care children and their families.  Essentially the defendants want the Court to grant\n16 protection from disclosure of the information while the plaintiffs request that this Court mandate\n17 that the parties enter into the protective order and require disclosure.  The defendants seek to\n18 include the following language in the protective order,  which the plaintiffs’ contend is overbroad\n19 and defeats the purpose of the proposed protective order,\n20 Clark County views the statutory language in NRS 432B.280 and 432B.290 broadly\nand believes that agreeing to stamp documents ‘confidential’ and then disclose them\n21 to opposing counsel does not meet the stated confidentiality requirements of the\nstatutes.  The County also believes that Judge Herndon’s order regarding disclosures\n22 under NRS 432B.280 reflects a correct interpretation of that statute for purposes of\nthis litigation.  Therefore, the County intends to proceed very carefully with regard\n23 to disclosure of  documents and reserves the right to object to disclosures of\nconfidential documents at any time.\n24\nThe defendants’ contend that under 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(8), individual state statutes may\n25\nadopt more restrictive regulations regarding the disclosure of confidential information about\n26\n27 1The previous motion was denied as prematurely filed without any attempt to meet and confer\nbetween and among counsel to resolve the discovery issue in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil\n28 Procedure 26(c).\n- 2 -\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 186   Filed 03/12/08   Page 3 of 6\n1 foster care programs than that suggested under the federal statute.  The defendants’ request that\n2 the Court take judicial notice of NRS 432B.280, NRS 432B.290, and NRS 432B.407(4). \n3 Specifically, the defendants’ contend that NRS 432B.290(1)(e) requires them to request in\n4 camera review of confidential documents before they may be disclosed to the plaintiffs in the\n5 discovery process.  NRS 432B.290 states that “Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2, 5\n6 and 6 and NRS 432B.513, data or information concerning reports and investigations thereof\n7 made pursuant to this chapter may be made available only to: . . . (e) A court, for in camera\n8 inspection only, unless the court determines that public disclosure of the information is necessary\n9 for the determination of an issue before it; . . . (g) The attorney and the guardian ad litem of the\n10 child.”  Further, NRS 432B.290(2) states that \n11 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, data or information concerning reports\nor investigations thereof made pursuant to this chapter may be made available to any\n12 member of the general public if the child who is the subject of a report dies or is\ncritically injured as a result of alleged abuse or neglect, except that the data or\n13 information which may be disclosed is limited to:\n(a) The fact that a report of abuse or neglect has been made and, if appropriate, a\n14 factual description of the contents of the report;\n(b) Whether an investigation has been initiated pursuant to NRS 432B.260, and the\n15 result of a completed investigation; and\n(c) Such other information as is authorized for disclosure by a court pursuant to\n16 subsection 4.\n17 Subsection 4 states that “Upon petition, a court of competent jurisdiction may authorize the\n18 disclosure of additional information to the public pursuant to subsection 2 if good cause is shown\n19 by the petitioner for the disclosure of the additional information.”\n20 The County Defendants take the position that they are not obligated to disclose the\n21 records for an in camera review by this Court, but that they are willing to disclose the records if\n22 it will advance the public interest in improving the County foster care system.  The defendants\n23 also assert that since the A children’s natural mother has signed a Confidentiality Agreement,\n24 containing language identical to that which they are requesting be inserted into the current\n25 protective order, in the wrongful death lawsuit, this acknowledges that disclosure of information\n26 about her children is subject to the limitations of NRS 432A.290. \n27 The County Defendants also argue that the proposed protective order has additional\n28 language which is problematic.  \n- 3 -\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 186   Filed 03/12/08   Page 4 of 6\n1 DISCUSSION\n2 A.  APPLICABILITY OF NEVADA REVISED STATUTE\n3 In this case, the Court must decide two issues related to the applicability of the Nevada\n4 Revised Statute.  First, whether the Nevada Revised Statute prohibits the disclosure of the\n5 plaintiffs’ case files in this case for the purpose of litigation, assuming that an appropriate\n6 protective order has been entered.  Second, if the Nevada Revised Statute does in fact prohibit\n7 disclosure, whether that prohibition is binding on this Court mandating a federal privilege.  The\n8 defendants rely on 26 U.S.C. § 6103 for the proposition that federal statutes may create a\n9 privilege in federal court beyond federal common law.   However, the issue in this case is not\n10 whether a federal statute may create a privilege in federal court, but whether a state statute may\n11 create a privilege in federal court, and if so, to what extent.  \n12 NRS 432B.290 specifically states that reports and investigations may be made available\n13 to the attorney and guardian ad litem of the child.  Therefore, contrary to the defendants’\n14 assertion, this Court may order disclosure of the reports and investigations involving the plaintiff\n15 children to the children’s attorneys without requiring the defendants to violate state law.  Further,\n16 NRS 432B.290(2) specifically addresses when information “may be made available to any\n17 member of the general public if the child who is the subject of a report dies or is critically injured\n18 as a result of alleged abuse or neglect.”  Here, the plaintiffs are not requesting the information in\n19 an attempt to disclose it to the general public.  To the contrary, the plaintiffs are willing to enter\n20 into a protective order for the purpose of preserving the confidentiality of the information in\n21 order to protect the privacy rights of the children involved.  Therefore, NRS 432B.290(2) does\n22 not apply to the circumstances of this case.\n23 NRS 432B.280 specifies the penalties for willfully releasing data or information\n24 concerning reports and investigations of abuse or neglect.  However, this section makes\n25 exceptions for information and data released as authorized or required pursuant to NRS\n26 432B.290.  Therefore, as previously stated, since NRS 432B.290 specifically authorizes the\n27 release of the information to the children’s attorneys, the defendants will not be subjected to\n28 criminal penalties for releasing the information in this case.  NRS 432B.407 is likewise\n- 4 -\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 186   Filed 03/12/08   Page 5 of 6\n1 inapplicable to this case.  This statute only applies to multidisciplinary teams reviewing the death\n2 of a child.\n3 The defendants also contend that 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(8) permits them to limit disclosure\n4 of confidential information.  The Court disagrees.  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(8) allows the states to\n5 adopt stricter standards regarding disclosure than specified within the federal statute.  However,\n6 the state of Nevada has not adopted a standard prohibiting disclosure in the present\n7 circumstances.  Therefore, County Defendants are not entitled to limit disclosure.  Since the state\n8 statute does not prohibit disclosure in the circumstances of this case, it is unnecessary for the\n9 Court to determine whether the statute creates a federal privilege which is binding on the Court\n10 and the parties.  Lastly, Defendants proposition that the federal statute requires in camera review\n11 by the court, or the alternative of disclosure to the public, is incorrect.  The statute provides\n12 exceptions to the non-disclosure requirements.  \n13 B.  PROPOSED PROTECTIVE ORDER\n14 The Clark County Defendants have additional concerns regarding the proposed protective\n15 order.  Specifically, the defendants contend that all references to class members should be\n16 removed since there is no certified class at this time.  The Court agrees.  Since there is not a\n17 certified class at this time that language is premature and shall be removed.  However, this does\n18 not preclude Plaintiffs from conducting discovery relating to the proposed class.  On May 14,\n19 2007, Judge Robert C. Jones ruled that Plaintiffs may “conduct discovery relating to the\n20 proposed class.”  Order (#134) at 43-47.  Accordingly, if Judge Jones grants class certification,\n21 then the protective order will also apply to the class.\n22 The defendants also state that they cannot stipulate that Plaintiffs’ DFS case records are\n23 discoverable in this action due to the expansive list of documents defined as “DFS case records.” \n24 Specifically, County Defendants state that they cannot stipulate that records belonging to third\n25 parties are DFS case records, nor that these documents are discoverable.  The Court agrees with\n26 Plaintiffs that using the language “which are in the custody of County Defendants” amply\n27 resolves this problem.  The defendants are not required to provide documents which are not in\n28 their custody.\n- 5 -\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 186   Filed 03/12/08   Page 6 of 6\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 The Court refuses to adopt a broad policy requiring in camera review of all documents in\n3 this type of case.  This task would be unduly burdensome on the Court and is unnecessary.  The\n4 Nevada Revised Statute permits disclosure to the attorneys of the children who are named in the\n5 investigations and reports.  Therefore, the parties shall enter into a protective order consistent\n6 with this Order.  The proposed protective order shall be entered into by the parties; however, all\n7 references to class members shall be deleted since a class has not been certified.\n8 ORDER\n9 Based on the foregoing, and good cause appearing therefore, \n10 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Entry of Protective Order (#119)\n11 is GRANTED, consistent with this Order.\n12 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Protection from\n13 Disclosure of Confidential Information (#120) is DENIED.\n14 DATED this   12th   day of March, 2008\n15\n16\n17\n18  \nROBERT J.

After considering the motion, the pleadings and papers on \n5 \nfile in this matter, and oral argument by the parties, the Court issues the following Order. \n6 \nPlaintiffs' Renewed Motion for Class Certification \n7 \nPlaintiffs' Renewed Motion and accompanying briefs sought to certify a class of \"all child \n8 \nabuse or neglect victims who are or will be involuntarily placed outside the homes of their parents or \n9 \n10  guardians by County Department of Family Services pursuant to an order of the court under Nev. \n11  Rev. Stat. § 432B.\" 1 \n12 \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), \"[a] district coUti may certify a class only if: '(1) the class is so \n13 \nnumerous  that joinder of all  members  is  impracticable;  (2)  there are  questions  of law  and  fact \n14 \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims \n15 \nor defenses  of the class; and (4 )  the representative parties will  fairly and adequately protect the \n16 \ninterests ofthe class.'\"  Dukes v.  Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168, 1176 (91 Cir. 2007).  \"The district \n17  h \n18  court  must  also  find  that at least  one  of the  following  three  conditions  are  satisfied:  ( 1)  the \n19  prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of: (a) inconsistent or vatying adjudications or \n20 \n(b)  individual  adjudications  dispositive  of the  interests  of other members  not a party to  those \n21 \nadjudications;  (2)  the party opposing the class has  acted or refused to  act on grounds generally \n22 \napplicable to  the class; or (3) the questions of law or fact common to  the members of the class \n23 \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to \n24 \n25  other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.

The Court disagrees and notes that it must apply a \"rigorous analysis\" to see that  the class \n4 \ncertification criteria have been met.  Zinser v. Accujix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F. 3d 1180, 1186 (91h \n5 \nCir. 2001) (quoting  Valentino v.  Carter-Wallace,  Inc.,  97 F.3d 1227,  1233  (91h  Cir.  1996).  This \n6 \nanalysis fairly encompasses an evaluation of the factual record and allows for factual findings.  See \n7 \n8  Dukes, 509 F.3d at 1175-76, 1178 n.2 (deferring to district court's broad discretion to make factual \n9  findings as to the applicability of Rule 23 criteria and to the district court's decision whether to \n10  certify class).2 \n11 \nAs discussed below, the Court finds, based on the record before it, that Plaintiffs have met \n12 \nthe  numerosity  requirement  of Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)  but have  not  met  the  rest  of the  23(a) \n13 \nprerequisites or the maintainability requirement of Rule 23(b )(2). \n14 \nNumerosity \n15 \n16  This Court has previously ruled that the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) has been \n17  established.  CD# 134 at 44-45.  The Court further finds that the narrowed class definition advanced \n18 \nby Plaintiffs in their Combined Reply (CD #224 at 5) also meets the numerosity requirement. \n19 \nCommonality \n20 \nThe commonality requirement for class certification is met if plaintiffs' grievances share a \n21 \ncommon question of law or of fact.  See Armstrong v.  Davis, 275 F. 3d 849, 868 (91h Cir. 2001). \n22 \n23  Additionally,  the  commonality test  for  class  actions  is  qualitative  rather than  quantitative;  one \n24  significant issue common to the proposed class may be sufficient to warrant certification.  Dukes, \n25 \n509  F .3d  at  I 184.  Moreover,  in  a  civil  rights  suit,  the  commonality  requirement  for  class \n26 \n27  2 See also Advisory Committee Note to 2003 Proposed Amendments to Rule 23, 201 F.R.D. 560 at 592-93 (discussing \nhow pre-certification discovery can illuminate, for example, nature of the issues, whether the evidence on the merits is \ncommon to members of the proposed class, whether the issues are susceptible to class-wide proof, and what trial \n28 \nmanagement problems the case will present-\"this discovery does not concern the weight of the merits or the strength of \nthe evidence.\") \nPage 3 of 10 \n103251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 4g eo f4 1 o0f 10\nI  certification is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all \n2  putative class members, despite individual factual differences among individual litigants or groups \n3 \nof litigants.  See Armstrong, 275 F. 3d at 868. \n4 \nIn Armstrong, the Ninth Circuit held that differences in particular class members' disabilities \n5 \ndid not justifY requiring separate actions, since all disabled prisoners and parolees suffered similar \n6 \nharm from board's system-wide failure to accommodate their disabilities, i.e., the harm they suffered \n7 \n8  was  all  of a  piece - they  were  denied  parole  and parole  revocation  proceedings  without  the \n9  appropriate administrative process being followed.  See Armstrong, 275 F. 3d at 868. \n10 \nIn this case, by contrast, Plaintiffs' evidence presented to the Court has not shown that this \nII \nsuit challenges a systemwide practice or a policy affecting all putative class members, rather than \n12 \nalleged individual wrongs against the named plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs contend that they have shown \n13 \n\"overwhelming evidence\" of systemwide violations as set forth in Dukes v.  Wal-Mart.  The Court \n14 \ndisagrees. \n15 \n16  In Dukes, the district court analyzed factual data showing evidence of company-wide policies \n17  and  practices  and  statistical  data  presented by an  expert  statistician.  509  F.3d  at  1178-1182. \n18 \nAdditionally,  the  district  court  considered  circumstantial  and  anecdotal  evidence  to  bolster the \n19 \nstatistical evidence of pattern and practice of discrimination and to bring the statistical numerical \n20 \nevidence  to  life.  509  F.3d at  1182.  Here,  on the  other hand,  plaintiffs  have  submitted  only \n21 \ncircumstantial and anecdotal suppotting evidence without the underlying statistical expert evidence \n22 \n23  based on well-established statistical evidence.  In making its discretionmy and qualitative assessment \n24  of whether the commonality requirement had been fulfilled for  certification purposes, this Court \n25  finds that the requirement has not been satisfied based on merely the circumstantial and anecdotal \n26 \nevidence before the Comt at this time. \n27 \n28 \nPage 4 of 10 \n103251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 5g eo f5 1 o0f 10\nI  Typicality \n2 \nThe typicality requirement for class certification requires that claims of class representatives \n3 \nbe typical of those of the class, and is satisfied when each class member's claim arises from the same \n4 \ncourse of events, and each class member make similar legal arguments to prove defendants' liability. \n5 \nSee Armstrong, 275 F. 3d at 868.  The typicality requirement for class certification does not require \n6 \nthat named plaintiffs'  injuries be identical with those of other class members, only that unnamed \n7 \n8  class members have injuries similar to those of named plaintiffs and that injuries result from the \n9  same, injurious course of conduct.  See Armstrong, 275 F. 3d at 869. \n10 \nFor example,  in Armstrong, the Ninth Circuit stated that the undisputed facts  from  trial \nII \nshowed that the State of California regularly discriminated against disabled prisoners and parolees \n12 \nduring its parole and parole revocation hearing processes.  275 F.3d at 854.  The district court found \n13 \nthat  the  California  Board  of Prison  Terms  (the  state  parole  authority)  failed  to  make  proper \n14 \naccommodations for numerous disabled prisoners and parolees, with the result that a number of such \n15 \n16  individuals forfeited their rights to parole and parole revocation hearings and appeals, while others \n17  were unable to represent themselves adequately at such proceedings, all in contravention of federal \n18 \nlaw.  275 F.3d at 854.  Therefore, it was undisputed on appeal that the unnamed class members had \n19 \ninjuries similar to those of named plaintiffs and that the injuries (forfeiture of rights to parole and \n20 \nparole-determinative proceedings) resulted from the same, injurious course of conduct. \n21 \nIn this purported class action, by contrast, the alleged harms among the named plaintiffs \n22 \n23  alone  are  diverse  and manifold,  ranging  from  deprivation  of educational  assistance  services,  to \n24  deprivation  of psychological  services,  to  deprivation  of psychotropic  mediations,  to  improper \n25 \nreunification with a natural parent, to the emotional distress caused by the death of a sibling, and \n26 \nmore.  Each of these injuries is alleged to be caused by different courses of conduct by government \n27 \nactors,  including  failure  to  supervise,  failure  to  provide  educational  services  and psychological \n28 \nservices, etc.  Each of these alleged actions or inactions by government actors are, in tum, alleged to \nPage 5 of 10 \n103251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 6g eo f6 1 o0f 10\n1  be caused by larger systemic factors such as large caseloads per caseworker, insufficient training of \n2 \ncaseworkers,  shortage  of guardians  ad  litem  and  CASAs  to  represent  children  in  dependency \n3 \nproceedings, and other problems.  The sheer number and complexity of issues that currently are \n4 \nasserted  in  this  case  among  the  named  plaintiffs  alone  fail  to  meet Rule  23(a)'s mandate  that \n5 \nunnamed class members have injuries similar to those of named plaintiffs and that injuries result \n6 \nfrom same, injurious course of conduct.  See Armstrong, 275 F.  3d at 867 (Plaintiffs showed that \n7 \n8  each of them was  discriminated against in  violation of the ADA at  parole or parole revocation \n9  hearings - each of them \"suffered from the same injurious conduct; each incmTed the same injmy; \n10 \nand each is seeking the same relief.\") \n11 \nPlaintiffs point to case law from other jurisdictions but there is no Ninth Circuit case law \n12 \nwith class certification based on \"common\" issues at the extreme level of generality urged here.3 \n13 \nThis Court is in agreement with J.B.  v.  Valdez, in which the Tenth Circuit said that it would not \n14 \n\"read an allegations of systemic failures as a moniker for meeting the class action requirements.  186 \n15 \n16  F.3d 1280, 1289 (101h Cir. 1999). \n17  The typicality question is tied into the commonality question discussed above, as the two \n18 \ninquiries  of commonality  and typicality  tend  to  merge.  See Dukes,  509  F.3d  at  1184.  Class \n19 \nrepresentatives must show typical claims that are reasonably coextensive with those of the absent \n20 \nclass members.  Dukes, 509 F.3d at 1184.  Because plaintiffs have not demonstrated any pattern or \n21 \npractice of violation of the putative class members' legal rights, there is no way for the Comi to \n22 \n23 \n24 \n3 The Ninth Circuit's recent cases cited by the parties involving cetiified classes were \n25 \ncertified for issues much more nanowly-drawn than the ones here.  See, e.g., Walters v. Reno, 145 \nF.3d 1032 (class cetiified for aliens alleging a due process violation for inadequate notice of \n26 \ndeportation following charges of document fraud); Hanlon v. Chrysler, 150 F .3d 1011 (c etiified \nclass of minivan owners alleging defectively designed rear lift gate latch); Dukes v.  Wal-Mart, 509 \n27 \nF.3d 1168 (certified class alleging sex discrimination against women employees resulting in \nsystematically lower wages and fewer and delayed promotions); LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318 \n28 \n(certified class of migrant workers seeking relief from random checks by INS of migrant worker \nhousing buildings). \nPage 6 of 10 \n103251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 7g eo f7 1 o0f 10\n1  assess whether the named plaintiffs' claims are reasonably coextensive with those of the absent \n2 \nputative class members at this time.  Therefore, the typicality requirement has not been satisfied. \n3 \nAdequacy of Representation \n4 \nThe adequacy of representation factor for class certification requires that (I) the proposed \n5 \nrepresentative plaintiffs do not have conflicts of interest with the proposed class; and (2) plaintiffs \n6 \nare represented by qualified and competent counsel.  Dukes, 509 F.3d at 1185. \n7 \nThe Court cannot ascertain at this point that the proposed representative plaintiffs do not \n8 \n9  have  conflicts  of interest  with  the  proposed  class.  As  discussed  above  in  the  context  of \n10 \ncommonality, plaintiffs have not offered sufficient evidence of patterns or practices of systemwide \n11 \nviolations.  As discussed in Armstrong, \"[ fJor class certification to occur, the court must find that the \n12 \nnamed plaintiffs adequately represent the interests and experiences of the overall class.  In making \n13 \nsuch findings,  the trial court must be afforded a wide degree of discretion to  determine when a \n14 \nparticular number of inmate witnesses is sufficient to justify system-wide relief for the identified \n15 \n16  violation.\"  275 F.3d at 871.  Here, there is insufficient evidence of justification for systemwide \n17  relief as opposed to individual relief for the named plaintiffs. \n18 \nThe Court also cannot ascertain at this time whether plaintiffs are adequately represented by \n19 \ncurrent counsel, and the Court has a duty to protect the interests of class members.  \"Attorneys and \n20 \nparties seeking to represent the class assume fiduciary responsibilities and the court bears a residual \n21 \nresponsibility to protect the interests of class members.\"  15  Herbert B. Newberg &  Alba Conte, \n22 \nNewberg on Class Actions  § 15.3 at 13 (4111  ed. 2002) (quoting Manual for Complex Litigation (3d. \n23 \n24  ed.) § 30.  Given the lack of classwide evidence at this point, it remains a possibility that plaintiffs' \n25 \ncounsel are not providing zealous representation of their individual clients, including their claims for \n26 \nmoney damages, in order to pursue the larger class allegations on behalf of their organization and \n27 \ngenerate attorneys' fees.  The named plaintiffs, not to mention the absent putative class members, \n28 \nrun the risk of having their potentially substantial money damages claims barred by statutes of \nPage 7 of 10 \n103251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 8g eo f8 1 o0f 10\n1  limitations and res judicata concerns.  Thus, the adequacy of representation requirement has not been \n2 \nfulfilled at this time. \n3 \nMaintainability of Class Action Under Rule 23(b )(2) \n4 \nIn determining the applicability of Rule 23(b) (2), a court must examine the specific facts and \n5 \ncircumstances of each case,  focusing predominantly on plaintiffs'  intent in bringing suit.  At a \n6 \nminimum, the court must satisfy itself that (1) even in the absence of possible monetary recovety, \n7 \n8  reasonable plaintiffs would bring suit to obtain the injunctive or declaratory relief sought; and (2) \n9  that the injunctive or declaratory relief sought would be both reasonably necessaty and appropriate \n10 \nwere the plaintiffs to succeed on the merits.  Dukes, 509 F.3d at 1186. \n11 \nAs discussed above in the context of adequacy of representation, the Court is  unable to \n12 \nsatisfy itself at this  time that the potential  money damages  claims  of the named plaintiffs  are \n13 \nprotected adequately in this suit seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief for a putative class. \n14 \nTherefore, the Court cannot say that reasonable plaintiffs would bring suit to obtain the injunctive or \n15 \n16  declaratory relief. \n17  Additionally, the Court cannot tell at this time that the injunctive or declaratory relief sought \n18 \nwould be both reasonably necessary and appropriate were the plaintiffs to succeed on the merits. \n19 \nInextricably tied into the consideration of whether class certification is appropriate is the question of \n20 \nthe scope of injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs contend that the scope or any details of the relief they seek is \n21 \nimmaterial  at  this  early  stage  of the  litigation,  but  this  assetiion  ignores  the  Ninth  Circuit's \n22 \ndiscussion in Armstrong regarding the U.S. Supreme Comi's hesitance in ordering systemwide relief \n23 \n24  against governmental actors rather than awarding individual damages for proven harms.  As the \n25 \nArmstrong Court observed, \n26 \n[t]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established .. \n.  [t]he  key  question  ... is  whether  the  inadequacy  complained  of is  in  fact \n27 \n'widespread enough to justify system wide relief .. [under the] longstanding maxim \nthat  injunctive  relief against  a  state  agency  or official  must  be no  broader than \n28 \nnecessary to remedy the constitutional violation.  System-wide relief is required if the \nPage 8 of 10 \nI 03251.11 \n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v6--0c1v0-06180-R68C-JR-CRJJ-JR  J  J D   oDcoucmuemnet n2t3 264  3       FFiilleedd  0067//2130//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 9g eo f9 1 o0f 10\n1  injury is the result of violations of a statute or the constitution that are attributable to \npolicies or practices pervading the whole system ... or if the unlawful policies or \n2  practices affect such a broad range of plaintiffs that an overhaul of the system is the \nonly feasible manner in which to address the class's injury.  However, if injunctive \n3  relief is premised upon only a few isolated violations affecting a nanow range of \nplaintiffs, its scope must be limited accordingly .... \n4 \nWe also note that the decision to grant system-wide prospective injunctive relief does \n5  not occur in a vacuum; it is intimately connected to determinations made earlier in the \nlawsuit ... and the court's determination that relief may be sought by a class of \n6  plaintiffs  is  relevant  to  the  scope  of the  relief to  be  awarded.  In  fact,  class \ncertification serves to alter that court's inquiry:  when a class is properly certified, the \n7  injury asserted by the named plaintiffs ... is asserted on behalf of all members of the \nclass .. [and] the \"plaintiff\" has been broadened to include the class as a whole, and \n8  no longer simply those named in the complaint. \n9 \n275 F.3d at 870-71.  (citations and quotations omitted). \n10 \nWhen plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against a state agency on behalf of a class, but relief on \n11 \n12  behalf of a large class is inappropriate, the court will limit relief to named plaintiffs.  See Armstrong \n13  275 F.3d at 870 n.27; see also City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 113 (1983) (if a plaintiff \n14 \n\"has suffered an injmy barred under the Federal Constitution, he has a remedy for damages under § \n15 \n1983\"). \n16 \nOn the other hand, in detetmining scope of injunctive relief that interferes with affairs of \n17 \nstate agency,  a federal  court must ensure,  out of federalism  concerns, that any injunction heels \n18 \nclosely to the identified violation, and is not overly intrusive and unworkable, and would not require \n19 \n20  for its enforcement the continuous supervision by a federal court over conduct of state officers.  See \n21 \nArmstrong, 275 F.3d at 872.  Because the issue of injunctive relief is tied in with certification of any \n22 \nclass,  this  Court  does  not believe  certification  is  appropriate  until  plaintiffs  are  able  to  show \n23 \nsystemwide violations mandating systemwide relief rather than the individual claims of the named \n24 \nplaintiffs for damages. \n25 \nConclusion \n26 \n27  For the reasons stated above, the Court hereby DENIES WITHOUT PREruDICE Plaintiffs' \n28  Renewed Motion for Class Certification.

For the reasons given herein,\n19 the Court grants the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and will hear argument on\n20 the motions for summary judgment and to disqualify counsel at the hearing currently scheduled\n21 for May 15, 2014.\n22 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n23 Plaintiffs are eleven children who claim to have been harmed due to the failure of state\n24 and county child welfare authorities to adhere to certain mandatory laws and regulations and to\n25 ensure their safety as a general matter.  Their injuries include abuse and neglect by foster parents\n\n1 and institutional guardians, as well as a lack of medical care due to authorities’ refusal to\n2 authorize or monitor it.\n3 Plaintiff Henry A. is a fourteen-year-old boy who was placed into foster care by the Clark\n4 County Department of Family Services (“CCDFS”) and the Nevada Division of Children and\n5 Family Services (“NDCFS”) from 2005 until February 2013, when he was returned to his\n6 mother’s care. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 20, July 12, 2013, ECF No. 176).  He suffers from severe\n7 mental health problems but his treatment has been sporadic because of his placement with over\n8 forty foster families and six or seven caseworkers during his first seven years under CCDFS. (See\n9 id.).  He has changed mental health providers over ten times. (Id.).  He has been prescribed\n10 multiple psychotropic drugs and once overdosed because of a combination of these drugs,\n11 spending several weeks in the intensive care unit. (Id.).\n12 Plaintiffs Charles B. and Charlotte B. are siblings, ages twelve and four, respectively. (Id.\n13 ¶ 21).  They were placed into seventeen different placements for foster care by CCDFS from\n14 March 2009 to the Fall of 2010, when they were returned to their mother’s care. (Id.).  CCDFS\n15 placed Charles and Charlotte with foster parents in March 2009 despite a court order requiring\n16 placement with their grandmother. (Id.).  One foster mother and her teenage son abused them,\n17 including locking Charlotte in a closet with no food, water, or sanitation for long periods of time\n18 and beating Charles when he tried to help his sister. (Id.).  The police eventually removed them\n19 and took them to the hospital for treatment. (Id.).  Charlotte was suffering from dehydration, cuts,\n20 bruises, and severe (bleeding) diaper rash. (Id.).  The foster mother has been charged with child\n21 abuse, and her son has pled guilty to assault. (Id.).  \n22 Plaintiff Linda E. is a twenty-year-old woman who was placed into more than forty\n23 different placements for foster care by CCDFS and NDCFS for over fifteen years. (Id. ¶ 22).  She\n24 suffered abuse and neglect in many of these placements, including being placed into the home of\n25 an aunt where she had previously suffered unspecified abuse. (Id.).  Linda reported the abuse to\nPage 2 of  26\n\n1 her caseworker. (Id.).  She did not receive proper medical and psychiatric care. (Id.).  \n2 Plaintiffs Leo and Victor C. are twenty-year-old twins who were placed into foster care by\n3 CCDFS in November 2006. (Id. ¶ 23).  Leo left the system when he became an adult in\n4 December 2010. (Id.).  Victor, however, chose to remain in the system after age eighteen and\n5 now receives benefits under Assembly Bill 350. (Id.).  Defendants refused to place Leo and\n6 Victor in the care of their grandmother, who was ready, willing, and able to provide a safe and\n7 appropriate environment for them, instead moving them between their father and their mother\n8 and her boyfriend, where they suffered unspecified abuse. (Id.).  Eventually, either their mother\n9 or father abandoned them at Child Haven. (See id.).  Defendants failed to provide psychiatric care\n10 despite Victor’s suicidal threats. (Id.).  Plaintiffs do not allege any untreated psychiatric\n11 conditions of Leo.\n12 Plaintiffs Maizy and Jonathan D. are siblings. (Id. ¶ 24).  Maizy and Jonathan are ages\n13 eight and seven, respectively, and were placed into foster care by CCDFS from late 2005 to\n14 August 2009. (Id.).  As infants, Defendants placed them with Child Haven, where they did not\n15 receive basic nutrition and medical care. (Id.).  They were kept on a “formula diet” despite\n16 outgrowing it. (Id.).  Maizy and Jonathan were left in their cribs with limited interaction with\n17 other children and adults, resulting in a diagnosis (presumably by a doctor, though not explicitly\n18 so alleged) with “failure to thrive,” based upon being underweight due to environmental factors.\n19 (See id.).  S.W. has adopted both children. (Id.).  Defendants have failed to provide authorization\n20 for at least three medical procedures for the children despite S.W.’s efforts. (Id. ¶ 25).  The\n21 related conditions became so severe that doctors proceeded with the procedures on an emergency\n22 basis. (Id.).  As a result, Jonathan has a misshapen colon that must be surgically corrected due to\n23 Defendants’ failure to authorize removal of calcified stool from his colon. (Id.).  \n24 Plaintiff Olivia G. is a twelve-year-old girl who was placed into foster care by CCDFS\n25 from January 2006 to 2011. (Id. ¶ 26).  Defendants failed to remove her from the custody of her\nPage 3 of  26\n\n1 parents despite reports that she was being abused. (Id.).  She was initially placed with various\n2 relatives without any effort to determine if they were able to provide appropriate care. (Id.).  She\n3 was abused in some of those homes, including being beaten with a belt. (Id.).  She has severely\n4 impaired neuropsychological functioning and several cognitive and behavioral impairments as a\n5 result. (Id.).  She was also prescribed multiple psychotropic drugs without adequate care and\n6 monitoring, including being placed with E.F. without providing E.F. the information and\n7 authorizations required to obtain Olivia’s prescriptions. (Id.).  \n8 Plaintiff Christine F. is a six-year-old girl who was placed into foster care by CCDFS\n9 from May 2008 to June 2010, when E.F. adopted her. (Id. ¶ 27).  Christine is severely\n10 developmentally delayed and suffers form permanent disabilities and a seizure disorder due to\n11 having fallen from a second-story window at the home of her mother, grandmother, and two\n12 uncles. (See id.).  Despite marks around her ankles indicating she had been dangled from the\n13 window or been swung into a wall, CCDFS did not investigate and take custody of Christine\n14 until her parents refused to authorize medical treatment necessary to treat her injuries. (Id.). \n15 Defendants later failed to provide E.F. with Christine’s seizure medications and offered no\n16 medical support or training on how to care for her special needs. (Id.).  Defendants have also\n17 permitted her grandmother to visit her despite knowing of past allegations of abuse against her\n18 and that she was watching over Christine when she fell from the window. (Id.).1\n19 Plaintiff Mason I. is a fifteen-year-old boy who has been placed into foster care by\n20 CCDFS since July 2003. (Id. ¶ 28).  Mason has been deaf since birth and entered foster care at\n21 age six after suffering physical, sexual, and emotional abuse by his parents and grandparents.\n22 (Id.).  He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder, and other\n23 serious mental health problems. (Id.).  During his first six years in foster care, he was placed into\n24\n1Plaintiff does not allege actual abuse by this person against Christine herself or any other\n25\nperson, but notes only that CCDFS was aware of prior allegations of abuse. \nPage 4 of  26\n\n1 twenty-five different homes, including a treatment center in Florida, the National Deaf Academy\n2 (“NDA”). (Id.).  The NDA staff rendered Mason’s cochlear implant permanently inoperative\n3 against his wishes. (Id.).  Defendants ignored Mason’s complaints of sexual abuse by NDA staff.\n4 (Id.).  Defendants have failed to place Mason into homes where his special needs will be met,\n5 i.e., with a qualified American Sign Language interpreter and have failed to provide speech\n6 therapy. (Id.).  Defendants have failed to disclose Mason’s medical, mental, social, and\n7 educational backgrounds to his foster parents and have failed to properly supervise the\n8 administration of Mason’s psychotropic drugs. (Id.).  \n9 The current State Defendants are Michael Willden, Director of the Nevada Department of\n10 Health and Human Services (“NDHHS”), sued in his official capacity, (id. ¶ 30); and Amber\n11 Howell, the Administrator of NDCFS, sued in her official capacity, (id. ¶ 31).  The current\n12 County Defendants are Clark County, Nevada, (id. ¶ 33); Virginia Valentine, the Clark County\n13 Manager from August 2006 to January 2011, sued in her individual capacity, (id. ¶ 34); Don\n14 Burnette, the current Clark County Manager, sued in his official capacity, (id. ¶ 35); Tom\n15 Morton, the Director of CCDFS from July 2006 to August 2011, sued in his individual capacity,\n16 (id. ¶ 36); and Lisa Ruiz-Lee, the current Director of CCDFS, sued in her official capacity, (id.\n17 ¶ 37).  The current “Doe Defendants”2 are ten current or former caseworkers, licensing\n18 investigators, and other employees of CCDFS: Stacey Scott, Thor Martinez, Debbie Mallwitz,\n19 Sonya Weathers, Darrel Ford, Yvette Chevalier, Teresa Cragon, Philomena Osemwengie, Sylvia\n20 Clark, and Patricia Martin. (Id. ¶¶ 38–54).\n21 Plaintiffs filed the seventy-five-page Complaint in this Court on April 13, 2010, listing\n22 the following twelve nominal claims: (1)–(2), (11) substantive due process violations pursuant to\n23\n24 2It is not clear why these Defendants are listed as “Doe Defendants.”  Their identities are\nclearly alleged.  Plaintiffs also allege the existence of additional “Doe Defendants,” (see id. ¶ 56),\n25\nbut that pleading practice has no effect in federal court.\nPage 5 of  26\n\n1 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (3), (8) violations of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act\n2 (“AACWA”) pursuant to § 1983; (4), (12) substantive due process violations under the Nevada\n3 Constitution; (5) negligence; (6) declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201,\n4 2202 that Nevada Revised Statute (“NRS”) section 424.090 violates the Supremacy Clause; (7)\n5 declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202 that NRS section 432.0177\n6 violates the Supremacy Clause; and (9)–(10) violations of the Child Abuse Prevention and\n7 Treatment Act (“CAPTA”) pursuant to § 1983.  The case was assigned to the Hon. Howard D.\n8 McKibben but was reassigned to this Court after Judge McKibben recused himself.  \n9 Defendants moved to dismiss.  Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the sixth and seventh\n10 nominal claims (the Supremacy Clause claims).  In a thirty-one-page order, the Court granted the\n11 motions to dismiss. (See Order, Oct. 26, 2010, ECF No. 85).  The Court ruled: (1) Defendants in\n12 their official capacities were not entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection from claims for\n13 prospective injunctive relief; (2) Defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity; (3)\n14 Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from the “duty to protect” substantive due\n15 process claim; (4) Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from the “state created\n16 danger” substantive due process claim, and that claim was also dismissed for failure to state a\n17 claim; (5) sections 671(a)(10), (16) and 675(1), (5)(A)(ii), (5)(D) of the AACWA created no\n18 private right of action, and Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity against these\n19 claims in any case; (6) Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from the “guardian ad\n20 litem” CAPTA claim, and the Court would abstain from ruling on that claim under Younger v.\n21 Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971) due to pending state proceedings; (7) there was no private right of\n22 action for a “plan submission” claim under CAPTA; and (8) the Court would decline to rule on\n23 the negligence claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).\n24 Plaintiffs appealed.  In a thirty-four-page opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part,\n25 reversed in part, and remanded.  The Court affirmed the dismissal of all claims except the first,\nPage 6 of  26\n\n1 second, third, eighth, and eleventh, which claims it remanded for further proceedings, and ruled\n2 that Plaintiffs should be permitted to amend the substantive due process claims after remand and\n3 should be able to seek leave to amend the tenth claim.  The Court of Appeals ruled that qualified\n4 immunity applied only to Defendants in their individual capacities and only as to monetary\n5 damages.  It reversed the qualified immunity rulings as to injunctive relief and as to monetary\n6 damages against Clark County as to the first and eleventh causes of action and remanded for\n7 further analysis of qualified immunity as to the claims for monetary damages against Defendants\n8 in their individual capacities.  As to the second cause of action, the Court of Appeals ruled that\n9 the “state created danger” doctrine applied not only when the state actually created the danger,\n10 but also when the state knowingly exposed a person to an existing danger from a third person. \n11 The Court of Appeals therefore reversed dismissal of the second claim and this Court’s grant of\n12 qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals ruled that Plaintiffs had not sufficiently pled\n13 supervisory responsibility claims against State Defendants but should be given leave to amend\n14 the substantive due process claims to do so.  The Court of Appeals ruled that the “case plan”\n15 provisions of AACWA under 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16) and 675(1) and the “records provision”\n16 provisions of AACWA under §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1), and 675(5)(d) were privately enforceable. \n17 The Court of Appeals affirmed that the “guardian ad litem” and “early intervention” provisions\n18 of CAPTA, as well as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provision Plaintiffs\n19 invoked, were not privately enforceable.\n20 Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint (“AC”), listing six nominal claims: (1)–(2)\n21 substantive due process violations pursuant to § 1983; (3), (6) AACWA violations pursuant to\n22 § 1983; (4) substantive due process violations under the Nevada Constitution; and (5) negligence. \n23 State Defendants and County Defendants separately moved to dismiss the AC.  The Court\n24 granted the motions in part and denied them in part:\n25 (1) The substantive due process claims, both federal and state, are dismissed\nPage 7 of  26\n\n1 as against Defendants Willden and Comeaux insofar as they seek damages against\nthem  in  their  individual  capacities.    Under  the  law  of  the  case,  however,  no\n2 Defendants have qualified immunity at the dismissal stage.  The claims for injunctive\nrelief are moot except as to failure to provide health information to foster parents\n3 (Henry A.), failure to investigate reports of abuse (Mason I.), and failure to inspect\nout-of-state facilities (Mason I.). \n4\n(2)  The  Eleventh  Amendment  protects  State  Defendants  in  their  official\n5 capacities from money damages as to any claim.\n6 (3)  The  AACWA  “records  provision”  claim  is  dismissed  as  to  money\ndamages against Willden and Comeaux in their individual capacities, and the claim\n7 for injunctive relief is moot, except as to Plaintiffs Henry A. and Mason I.  The\nAACWA “case plan” claim is dismissed as to all Defendants, with leave to amend.\n8\n(4)  The  negligence  claim  is  dismissed  under  the  discretionary  immunity\n9 statute, except as to Christine F.’s and Mason I.’s claims invoking a negligence per\nse theory under NRS section 432B.260 and Olivia G.’s, Christine F.’s, and Mason\n10 I.’s claims invoking a negligence per se theory under NRS section 424.038.  Plaintiffs\nmay amend their negligence claim to plead negligence per se theories based upon\n11 violations of state statutes, but not based upon violations of federal law or state\nadministrative regulations.\n12\n(Order 28:7–24, Feb. 27, 2013, ECF No. 141).  \n13\nPlaintiffs moved for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which\n14\nmotion the Court granted in part.  County Defendants asked the Court to reconsider its previous\n15\norder in part.  The Court granted that motion in part, granting qualified immunity to individual\n16\nDefendants as to monetary damages under the AACWA, but not as to the substantive due process\n17\nclaims.  The Court dismissed the “no-case-plan” claim as against County Defendants, with leave\n18\nto amend.  The Court also clarified that:\n19\nThe  negligence  claim  remains  viable  against  County  Defendants  insofar  as  it  is\n20 predicated upon a negligence per se theory for violations of NRS sections 432B.260\n(Christine F. and Mason I.) and 424.038 (Olivia G., Christine F., and Mason I.), and\n21 Plaintiffs have leave to amend as to NRS sections 432.0177 and 127.330, and as to\nother Plaintiffs’ claims. \n22\nPlaintiffs filed the SAC.  The 101-page SAC lists five causes of action: (1) Substantive\n23\nDue Process (Duty to Protect) violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (against all Defendants\n24\nexcept Ford, Chevalier, and Osemwengie); (2) Substantive Due Process (State Created Danger)\n25\nPage 8 of  26\n\n1 violations pursuant to § 1983 (against all Defendants except Osemwengie); (3) AACWA\n2 violations (health care records) pursuant to § 1983 (against Clark County, Willden, Howell,\n3 Burnette, and Ruiz-Lee); (4) Negligence (against Clark County, Morton, Valentine, Clark,\n4 Chevalier, Ford, Mallwitz, Martin, Martinez, Osemwengie, Scott, and Weathers); and (5)\n5 AACWA violations (written case plan) pursuant to § 1983 (against Clark County, Willden,\n6 Howell, Burnette, and Ruiz-Lee).  County Defendants moved to dismiss the fifth cause of action\n7 or for a more definite statement, and State Defendants joined the motion.  The Court did not\n8 dismiss but required Plaintiffs to file a more definite statement via amendment or separate\n9 affidavit as to the nature of Mason I.’s case plan deficiencies under 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(g). \n10 In the present round of motions, Osemwengie has moved for defensive summary\n11 judgment as against the only claim against her (negligence), NDA has moved to dismiss\n12 Defendant Chevalier’s First Amended Third Party Complaint (FA3PC), and County Defendants\n13 have moved to disqualify three of Plaintiff’s counsel.\n14 II. DISCUSSION\n15 A. Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Third-Party Complaint\n16 1. Legal Standards\n17 a. Personal Jurisdiction\n18 A defendant may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n19 12(b)(2).  Personal jurisdiction exists if: (1) provided for by law; and (2) the exercise of\n20 jurisdiction comports with due process. See Greenspun v. Del E. Webb Corp., 634 F.2d 1204,\n21 1207 (9th Cir. 1980).  When no federal statute governs personal jurisdiction, a federal court\n22 applies the law of the forum state. See Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011, 1015 (9th Cir.\n23 2008).  Where a forum state’s long-arm statute provides for personal jurisdiction to the fullest\n24 extent of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, such as Nevada’s does, see\n25 Arbella Mut. Ins. Co. v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 134 P.3d 710, 712 (Nev. 2006) (citing Nev.\nPage 9 of  26\n\n1 Rev. Stat. § 14.065), a court need only apply federal due process standards, see Boschetto, 539\n2 F.3d at 1015.\n3 There are two categories of personal jurisdiction: general jurisdiction and specific\n4 jurisdiction.  General jurisdiction exists over a defendant who has “substantial” or “continuous\n5 and systematic” contacts with the forum state such that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over\n6 him is constitutionally fair even where the claims are unrelated to those contacts. See Tuazon v.\n7 R..J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 433 F.3d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Helicopteros\n8 Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U .S. 408, 415 (1984)).  The Supreme Court recently\n9 twice clarified that the reach of general jurisdiction is narrower than had been supposed in the\n10 lower courts for many years. See Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, at 755 (2014) (citing\n11 Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 131 S. Ct. 2836, 2851 (2011)) (noting that\n12 general jurisdiction lies not simply where a defendant has continuous and systematic contacts\n13 with the forum state, but where those contacts are so pervasive as to render the defendant\n14 “essentially at home” in the forum State).   \n15 Even where there is no general jurisdiction over a defendant, specific jurisdiction exists\n16 when there are sufficient minimal contacts with the forum state such that the assertion of\n17 personal jurisdiction “does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’”\n18 Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 316\n19 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  The standard has been restated\n20 using different verbiage. See Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U .S. 235, 253 (1958) (“[I]t is essential in\n21 each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege\n22 of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its\n23 laws.” (citing Int’l Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 319)); World-wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444\n24 U.S. 286, 297 (1980) (“[T]he foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere\n25 likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State.  Rather, it is that the defendant’s\nPage 10 of  26\n\n1 conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being\n2 haled into court there.” (citing Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal., 436 U.S. 84, 97–98 (1978))). \n3 From these cases and others, the Ninth Circuit has developed a three-part test for specific\n4 jurisdiction:\n5 (1) The non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate\nsome transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform some act by which\n6 he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,\nthereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws;\n7\n(2) the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum-\n8 related activities; and\n9 (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice, i.e.\nit must be reasonable.\n10\nBoschetto, 539 F.3d at 1016 (quoting Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797,\n11\n802 (9th Cir. 2004)).\n12\nThe plaintiff bears the burden on the first two prongs.  If the plaintiff establishes both\n13 prongs one and two, the defendant must come forward with a “compelling case” that\nthe exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.  But if the plaintiff fails at the\n14 first step, the jurisdictional inquiry ends and the case must be dismissed.\n15 Id. (citations omitted).  The “purposeful direction” option of the first prong uses the “Calder-\n16 effects” test, under which “the defendant allegedly must have (1) committed an intentional act,\n17 (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be\n18 suffered in the forum state.” Brayton Purcell LLP v. Recordon & Recordon, 606 F.3d 1124, 1128\n19 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L'Antisemitisme, 433\n20 F.3d 1199, 1206 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc)).  The third prong of the specific jurisdiction test is\n21 itself a seven-factor balancing test, under which a court considers:\n22 (1) the extent of the defendant’s purposeful interjection into the forum state’s affairs;\n(2) the burden on the defendant of defending in the forum; (3) the extent of conflict\n23 with  the  sovereignty  of  the  defendants’  state;  (4)  the  forum  state’s  interest  in\nadjudicating the dispute; (5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy;\n24 (6) the importance of the forum to the plaintiff's interest in convenient and effective\nrelief; and (7) the existence of an alternative forum.\n25\nPage 11 of  26\n\n1 Menken v. Emm, 503 F.3d 1050, 1060 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting CE Distrib., LLC v. New Sensor\n2 Corp., 380 F.3d 107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2004)).\n3 b. Failure to State a Claim\n4 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of the\n5 claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief” in order to “give the defendant fair notice of\n6 what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47\n7 (1957).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) mandates that a court dismiss a cause of action\n8 that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  A motion to dismiss under Rule\n9 12(b)(6) tests the complaint’s sufficiency. See N. Star Int’l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm’n, 720\n10 F.2d 578, 581 (9th Cir. 1983).  When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for\n11 failure to state a claim, dismissal is appropriate only when the complaint does not give the\n12 defendant fair notice of a legally cognizable claim and the grounds on which it rests. See Bell\n13 Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  In considering whether the complaint is\n14 sufficient to state a claim, the court will take all material allegations as true and construe them in\n15 the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See NL Indus., Inc. v. Kaplan, 792 F.2d 896, 898 (9th\n16 Cir. 1986).  The court, however, is not required to accept as true allegations that are merely\n17 conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences. See Sprewell v. Golden\n18 State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001).  A formulaic recitation of a cause of action\n19 with conclusory allegations is not sufficient; a plaintiff must plead facts pertaining to his own\n20 case making a violation plausible, not just possible. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677–79\n21 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556) (“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff\n22 pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is\n23 liable for the misconduct alleged.”).  In other words, under the modern interpretation of Rule\n24 8(a), a plaintiff must not only specify or imply a cognizable legal theory (Conley review), but\n25 also must plead the facts of his own case so that the court can determine whether the plaintiff has\nPage 12 of  26\n\n1 any plausible basis for relief under the legal theory he has specified or implied, assuming the\n2 facts are as he alleges (Twombly-Iqbal review).\n3 “Generally, a district court may not consider any material beyond the pleadings in ruling\n4 on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  However, material which is properly submitted as part of the\n5 complaint may be considered on a motion to dismiss.” Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner\n6 & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).  Similarly, “documents\n7 whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which\n8 are not physically attached to the pleading, may be considered in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6)\n9 motion to dismiss” without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary\n10 judgment. Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994).  Moreover, under Federal Rule\n11 of Evidence 201, a court may take judicial notice of “matters of public record.” Mack v. S. Bay\n12 Beer Distribs., Inc., 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir. 1986).  Otherwise, if the district court\n13 considers materials outside of the pleadings, the motion to dismiss is converted into a motion for\n14 summary judgment. See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, 261 F.3d 912, 925 (9th Cir.\n15 2001).\n16 2. Analysis\n17 Chevalier is a former employee of CCDFS. (See First Am. Third-Party Compl. ¶ 1, Nov.\n18 21, 2013, ECF No. 267).  She is implicated under the second and fourth claims of the SAC for\n19 substantive due process (state created danger) and negligence.  She has sued NDA, Deborah Hill,\n20 and Joseph Hill for equitable indemnity and contribution, and she has sued Deborah and Joseph\n21 Hill for express indemnity.  NDA has moved to dismiss or to stay, and for a change of venue.  \n22 Deborah Hill is a former foster parent of Plaintiffs Charles and Charlotte B., and Joseph\n23 Hill is Deborah Hill’s son. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 4).  Although Deborah and Joseph Hill resided in Nevada\n24 during the times relevant to the Complaint, they now reside in New York. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 5).  NDA is a\n25 Florida limited liability company that accepts patients from every state, including Nevada. (Id.\nPage 13 of  26\n\n1 ¶ 7).  In the SAC, Plaintiffs allege that Chevalier was responsible for oversight of the licensing\n2 investigation of Charles and Charlotte B.’s foster parent, who abused them. (Id. ¶ 10).  That\n3 foster parent was Deborah Hill, and she eventually pled guilty to two counts of child neglect.\n4 (Id. ¶ 12).  Joseph Hill was also criminally prosecuted for abusing Charles and Charlotte B., but\n5 the outcome of that prosecution is not alleged. (See id. ¶ 13).  “Additionally, allegations made in\n6 these proceedings relate to Mason I’s placement at NDA, and the licensing inspection thereof.”\n7 (Id. ¶ 14).  NDA notes that Mason I. alleges he was sexually abused by another resident at NDA\n8 and that the external component of his cochlear implant was improperly removed by NDA staff. \n9   NDA first argues there is no personal jurisdiction over it in Nevada.  In some cases, a\n10 tortious act occurring outside the disputed forum may still give rise to specific personal\n11 jurisdiction in that forum if the foreign act is purposely directed to the forum state. Dole Food\n12 Co., Inc. v. Watts, 303 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783,\n13 78–89 (1984)).  In Calder, the Supreme Court held that a defamatory article about a California\n14 resident published in Florida satisfied the Due Process Clause as to purposeful direction to\n15 California on the ground that the tortious conduct was “expressly aimed” at the forum state in\n16 which harm occurred (California). Id.  That is, the defendants in Calder “knew that the brunt of\n17 that injury would be felt by [the plaintiff] in the State in which she lives and works and in which\n18 the [publication] has its largest circulation.  Under the circumstances, petitioners must\n19 ‘reasonably anticipate being haled into court there’ to answer for the truth of the statements made\n20 in their article.” Calder, 465 U.S. at 789–90 (quoting World-wide Volkswagen Corp., 444 U.S. at\n21 297).\n22 Here, NDA accepted Mason I., a patient from Nevada, for treatment.  It therefore knew\n23 that any harm arising out of that care would manifest itself in (or continue to be felt in) Nevada\n24 once he returned.  Still, the Court of Appeals has ruled that the Calder effects test applies only to\n25 intentional torts, not to negligence claims. See Holland Am. Line Inc. v. Wartsila N. Am., Inc.,\nPage 14 of  26\n\n1 485 F.3d 450, 460 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  Because NDA’s wrongdoing\n2 is alleged only to be negligence, the Calder effects test cannot support personal jurisdiction over\n3 NDA in Nevada in this case.  NDA is not implicated in any intentional wrongdoing.  The\n4 allegations in the SAC indicate only that Mason I. was sexually abused (by an unidentified\n5 person) while at NDA, and that his cochlear implant was removed.  It does not plausibly allege\n6 that an employee of NDA was the abuser or that NDA’s removal of the implant amounted to a\n7 battery.  It is consistent with the SAC that a non-employee of NDA, i.e., another resident, was the\n8 abuser and that the implant was removed according to routine procedure without any objection\n9 by Mason I.  The SAC might be found to plausibly allege negligence against NDA (if NDA were\n10 a Defendant), but the allegations are not enough for the State of Nevada to exercise personal\n11 jurisdiction over NDA.  The acts did not occur in Nevada, and they were not directed to Nevada\n12 under Calder and Holland because no intentional torts by NDA are plausibly alleged.\n13 The Court will therefore dismiss the FA3PC as against NDA.  The Court will not transfer\n14 in the interests of justice, because venue lies in Nevada as to the SAC and the remainder of the\n15 FA3PC itself.  Chevalier may bring her indemnity and contribution claims against NDA in the\n16 Florida courts, if she can.\n17 B. Motion for Summary Judgment\n18 1. Legal Standards\n19  A court must grant summary judgment when “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n20 dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n21 Civ. P. 56(a).  Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the case. See Anderson v.\n22 Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute as to a material fact is genuine if there\n23 is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See id.  A\n24 principal purpose of summary judgment is “to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported\n25\nPage 15 of  26\n\n1 claims.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323–24 (1986).  In determining summary\n2 judgment, a court uses a burden-shifting scheme:\n3 When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at\ntrial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict\n4 if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.  In such a case, the moving party has the\ninitial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue\n5 material to its case.\nC.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations\n6\nand internal quotation marks omitted).  In contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden\n7\nof proving the claim or defense, the moving party can meet its burden in two ways: (1) by\n8\npresenting evidence to negate an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case; or (2) by\n9\ndemonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an\n10\nelement essential to that party’s case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. See\n11\nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323–24.  If the moving party fails to meet its initial burden, summary\n12\njudgment must be denied and the court need not consider the nonmoving party’s evidence. See\n13\nAdickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159–60 (1970).\n14\nIf the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to\n15\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n16\n475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  To establish the existence of a factual dispute, the opposing party\n17\nneed not establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor.  It is sufficient that “the\n18\nclaimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties’ differing\n19\nversions of the truth at trial.” T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d\n20\n626, 631 (9th Cir. 1987).  In other words, the nonmoving party cannot avoid summary judgment\n21\nby relying solely on conclusory allegations unsupported by facts. See Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d\n22\n1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  Instead, the opposition must go beyond the assertions and\n23\nallegations of the pleadings and set forth specific facts by producing competent evidence that\n24\nshows a genuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324.\n25\nPage 16 of  26\n\n1 At the summary judgment stage, a court’s function is not to weigh the evidence and\n2 determine the truth, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson, 477\n3 U.S. at 249.  The evidence of the nonmovant is “to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are\n4 to be drawn in his favor.” Id. at 255.  But if the evidence of the nonmoving party is merely\n5 colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. See id. at 249–50.\n6 2. Analysis\n7 Osemwengie moves for defensive summary judgment.  The Court will reserve its\n8 decision until after the May 15, 2014 hearing but will note its inclinations at this time for the\n9 benefit of the parties.  \n10 Osemwengie is charged only with negligence.  She was a Senior Family Services\n11 Specialist with CCDFS and was responsible for investigating reports concerning possible abuse\n12 of Victor and Leo C. in June and July 2005. (See Second Am. Compl. ¶ 50).  In July 2005, Victor\n13 and Leo’s mother telephoned Osemwengie and reported suspected sexual abuse, sending a\n14 pornographic magazine she claimed they had been reading and “some supporting emails.” (Id.\n15 ¶ 242).  Osemwengie allegedly made no efforts to investigate. (See id.).  These are the entirety of\n16 the allegations in the SAC as to Osemwengie.  Osemwengie argues that there is no evidence of\n17 any causal link between her acts or omissions and any abuse suffered by Plaintiffs, and that she is\n18 protected by the discretionary immunity statute in any case.\n19 Osemwengie notes that the children at issue were in the custody of their father after a\n20 divorce, and that their mother discovered a Playboy magazine on one of their backpacks during a\n21 weekend visit at the time when the twin boys were approximately 12 1/2 years old.  The boys\n22 admitted to having taken some pornographic media out of their father’s room without their\n23 father’s knowledge in the past, including the Playboy magazine.  At the time, the parents were in\n24 the midst of tit-for-tat reports of child abuse.  First, the father reported that the boys’ stepfather,\n25 who lived with their mother, had grabbed Leo C. by the shirt, choked him, and restrained him by\nPage 17 of  26\n\n1 the upper arm.  Osemwengie responded to the father’s house and checked the boys for bruises,\n2 finding none.  Osemwnegie interviewed the mother on June 30, 2005, who denied the charges\n3 and accused the boys of having attacked her and their stepfather.  The boys at that time indicated\n4 they did not wish to visit their mother anymore.  The stepfather denied the charges during a\n5 telephone interview on that day and said the boys liked to watch pornographic movies and were\n6 out of control.  Osemwengie then spoke to the mother about the pornography issue, which is\n7 when the mother mailed Osemwengie the Playboy magazine.  Osemwengie had visited the boys\n8 two days earlier at their father’s residence and did not believe they appeared to be “out of\n9 control” or that they acted in any way indicative of any sexual abuse.  (It appears that the sexual\n10 abuse alleged at that time was limited to the boys’ access to pornographic materials.)  The father\n11 denied exposing the boys to pornography and believed the mother was simply making allegations\n12 in retaliation for the allegations he had made, a pattern that Osemwengie noted is extremely\n13 common in contentious divorces, in her experience.  Osemwengie disbelieved the father and\n14 stepmother and did not find anything to substantiate any sexual abuse.\n15 Plaintiffs respond that the next time an investigator went to the home, one-and-a-half\n16 years later, she discovered the father’s pornography and elicited a confession of actual sexual\n17 abuse by him, which ultimately led to his conviction of three felony counts, for which he was\n18 sentenced to 28 years to life in prison.  Plaintiffs allege that the magazine the mother had found\n19 was not Playboy but was “more sexually graphic,” and that the emails at issue were pornographic\n20 in nature and had been sent to the boys by their father.  They note that Osemwengie concedes\n21 receiving the materials and putting them into a file without looking at them.    \n22       In Nevada, certain government actors have discretionary immunity from common law\n23 claims. See Nev. Rev. Stat. § 41.032.  This section of the code immediately follows the section\n24 that waives the state’s common law sovereign immunity but retains the state’s Eleventh\n25 Amendment protection. See id. § 41.031.  The discretionary immunity statute applies to actions\nPage 18 of  26\n\n1 brought “against an immune contractor or an officer or employee of the State or any of its\n2 agencies or political subdivisions.” See id. § 41.032.  On its face, the statute does not necessarily\n3 immunize municipal governments or their employees, because in some contexts municipalities\n4 are considered independent corporations or “persons” with their own identities, not mere political\n5 subdivisions of the state, at least in the eyes of Congress. See Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs. of\n6 City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).  The Nevada Supreme Court, however, has always\n7 assumed that municipalities are political subdivisions of the state for the purposes of the\n8 discretionary immunity statute. See, e.g., Travelers Hotel, Ltd. v. City of Reno, 741 P.2d 1353,\n9 1354–55 (Nev. 1987).  This construction is consistent with Monell, because the discretionary\n10 immunity statute only protects state and municipal agencies against state causes of action, such\n11 as the present negligence claim.  \n12 The question remains whether there is discretionary immunity as a matter of law in this\n13 case.  The statute immunizes municipal agencies and their employees against actions:\n14 [b]ased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a\ndiscretionary function or duty on the part of the State or any of its agencies or\n15 political subdivisions or of any officer, employee or immune contractor of any of\nthese, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\n16\nNev. Rev. Stat. § 41.032(2).  In interpreting this statute, the Nevada Supreme Court has explicitly\n17\nadopted the two-part test for discretionary immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act, under\n18\nwhich there is discretionary immunity when: (1) the allegedly negligent acts involve elements of\n19\njudgment or choice; (2) and the judgment or choice made involves social, economic, or political\n20\npolicy considerations. Martinez v. Maruszczak, 168 P.3d 720, 722 (Nev.2007) (citing Berkovitz v.\n21\nUnited States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988); United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315 (1991)).  Under this\n22\nstandard, a court does not ask whether the official abused his or her discretion, see Nev. Rev.\n23\nStat. § 41.032(2), but only whether the acts concerned a matter in which the official had\n24\ndiscretion.  In other words, the immunity is not infinitely broad, but once it is determined that the\n25\nPage 19 of  26\n\n1 acts at issue were within the breadth of the statute, i.e., that they involved judgment or choice on\n2 social, economic, or political policy considerations, the immunity then applies even to abuses of\n3 discretion.  Still, there is no discretionary immunity for acts taken in “bad faith,” which is a\n4 subjective failure that is worse than an objective abuse of discretion. See Falline v. GNLV Corp.,\n5 823 P.2d 888 (1991); accord Wright v. Wynn, 682 So.2d 1, 2 (Ala. 1996) (equating “bad faith” in\n6 this context with “malice or willfulness”).  The Falline Court held that “bad faith” encompasses\n7 acts that are completely outside the authority of an official: “Bad faith ... involves an\n8 implemented attitude that completely transcends the circumference of authority granted the\n9 individual or entity.  In other words, an abuse of discretion occurs within the circumference of\n10 authority, and an act or omission of bad faith occurs outside the circumference of authority.” Id.\n11 at 892 n. 3.  In Davis v. City of Las Vegas, the Ninth Circuit noted that under Falline, “where an\n12 officer arrests a citizen in an abusive manner not as the result of the exercise of poor judgment as\n13 to the force required to make an arrest [an objective abuse of discretion], but instead because of\n14 hostility toward a suspect or a particular class of suspects (such as members of racial minority\n15 groups) or because of a willful or deliberate disregard for the rights of a particular citizen or\n16 citizens [a subjective abuse of power], the officer’s actions are the result of bad faith and he is\n17 not immune from suit.” 478 F .3d 1048, 1060 (9th Cir. 2007).  The difference between a\n18 non-actionable abuse of discretion and an actionable bad-faith violation of rights therefore\n19 appears to turn on the state actor’s mental state; when he crosses the line from recklessness as to\n20 a person’s rights to malicious intent to violate them, he is no longer protected by the\n21 discretionary immunity statute, even if he initially satisfies the two-part test under Martinez.\n22 In this case, the first prong of discretionary immunity appears to be satisfied, because\n23 decisions concerning removal from a home based upon allegations between divorced parents\n24 clearly involves personal deliberation and judgment.  This prong of the test is usually easy to\n25\nPage 20 of  26\n\n1 satisfy—a task must simply involve some element of personal deliberation and choice so as not\n2 to be purely ministerial.\n3 The second prong of the test is trickier to apply. It focuses on the purposes of\n4 discretionary immunity:\n5 Because the FTCA’s discretionary-function exception is not a bright-line rule, federal\ncourts applying the Berkovitz–Gaubert test must assess cases on their facts, keeping\n6 in  mind  Congress’  purpose  in  enacting  the  exception:  “to  prevent  judicial\n‘second-guessing’  of  legislative  and  administrative  decisions  grounded  in  social,\n7 economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.”  Thus, if the\ninjury-producing  conduct  is  an  integral  part  of  governmental  policy-making  or\n8 planning,  if  the  imposition  of  liability  might  jeopardize  the  quality  of  the\ngovernmental  process,  or  if  the  legislative  or  executive  branch’s  power  or\n9 responsibility  would  be  usurped,  immunity  will  likely  attach  under  the  second\ncriterion.\n10\n. . . . \n11\nWe therefore adopt the Berkovitz–Gaubert approach and clarify that to fall within the\n12 scope  of  discretionary-act  immunity,  a  decision  must  (1)  involve  an  element  of\nindividual  judgment  or  choice  and  (2)  be  based  on  considerations  of  social,\n13 economic,  or  political  policy.    In  this,  we  clarify  that  decisions  at  all  levels  of\ngovernment,  including  frequent  or  routine  decisions,  may  be  protected  by\n14 discretionary-act  immunity,  if  the  decisions  require  analysis  of  government  policy\nconcerns.  However, discretionary decisions that fail to meet the second criterion of\n15 this test remain unprotected by NRS 41.032(2)’s discretionary-act immunity.\n16 Under the Berkovitz–Gaubert test, the decision to create and operate a public hospital\nand  the  college  of  medicine  are  the  type  of  decisions  entitled  to\n17 discretionary-function immunity, because those decisions satisfy both prongs of the\nBerkovitz–Gaubert test; namely, they involve elements of judgment and choice, and\n18 they relate to social and economic policy.  But, while a physician’s diagnostic and\ntreatment  decisions  involve  judgment  and  choice,  thus  satisfying  the  test’s  first\n19 criterion, those decisions generally do not include policy considerations, as required\nby the test’s second criterion.   In this case, as Dr. Martinez did not engage in\n20 policy-making decisions in his treatment of Mr. Maruszczak, he is not entitled to\nimmunity from suit under NRS 41.032(2).\n21\nMartinez, 168 P.3d at 729 (footnotes omitted).  The Martinez Court rejected the previously used\n22\ndiscretionary—ministerial test, under which liability could only attach where a government actor\n23\nwas bound to act in a narrowly particular way and strayed from that direction. See id. at 727 n.27\n24\n(citing Maturi v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep’t, 871 P.2d 932, 934 (Nev. 1994)).  Martinez\n25\nPage 21 of  26\n\n1 clarified that officials could be liable even where they exercised judgment if that judgment was\n2 not akin to social, economic, or political policy-making, but the case still did not distinguish\n3 between (1) exercising judgment in a way totally divorced from any existing policies and (2)\n4 exercising judgment in a way motivated by existing policies.\n5 The Nevada Supreme Court has applied Martinez several times, and it answered the\n6 question posed above in the latest such case.  In Butler ex rel. Butler v. Bayer, the Court ruled\n7 that defendants were not entitled to discretionary immunity as against a negligence claim for\n8 releasing a quadriplegic inmate outside his girlfriend’s trailer when she was not home and when\n9 the trailer had not been prepared to receive him as planned. 168 P.3d 1055, 1059–60, 1067 (Nev.\n10 2007).  Although the act involved personal judgment, it did not involve policy-making\n11 considerations.  Later, in City of Boulder City v. Boulder Excavating, Inc., the Court ruled that a\n12 city engineer who requested that a contractor replace one of its subcontractors had discretionary\n13 immunity against the subcontractor’s claims for defamation and intentional interference with\n14 contractual relationship, because the city engineer was executing city policy that was based upon\n15 public policy considerations—the city had experienced problems in dealing with the plaintiff\n16 company in the past. 191 P.3d 1175, 1177, 1180–81 (Nev. 2008).  The Boulder Excavating Court\n17 thus took the first step in answering the question posed, supra.  Most recently, in Ransdell v.\n18 Clark County, the Court answered the question clearly when it ruled that where there is no\n19 particular policy or statute in place making the act at issue a purely ministerial one, but where the\n20 actor’s personal decision is made in furtherance of stated goals and policies, the statute protects\n21 the actor. 192 P.3d 756, 763 (Nev. 2009).  In Ransdell, a county inspector obtained a warrant to\n22 have debris involuntarily removed from Mr. Ransdell’s property when he refused to remove it\n23 himself after several complaints, inspections, citations, and extensions of time. See id. at 759. \n24 The County removed the debris, and Mr. Ransdell brought § 1983 and state law tort claims\n25 against the County. Id. at 759–60.  Applying Martinez and examining a factually similar case\nPage 22 of  26\n\n1 from Iowa (which, like Nevada, had adopted the Berkovitz–Gaubert test), the Court ruled that the\n2 second prong of the test was satisfied “because the goals of the County in abating Ransdell’s\n3 property were motivated by environmental, health, and economic policies supported by Clark\n4 County Code and statutory authority.” Id. at 763.\n5 Ransdell does much to clarify the scope of an every-day actor’s immunity.  After\n6 Martinez but before Ransdell, it appeared that every-day actors such as county inspectors and\n7 police officers would not be immune under the statute unless their actions were ministerial tasks\n8 particularly commanded by ordinances or official policies.  Acts involving every-day\n9 implementation of policy choices, but which did not themselves consist of policy choices, did not\n10 appear to be protected.  Ransdell makes it clear that individual acts involving the implementation\n11 of covered types of policy choices are protected under the discretionary immunity statute. Id. at\n12 764 (“[B]ecause the County’s actions were grounded on public policy concerns, as expressed in\n13 the County Code and Nevada’s abatement statute, they fit within the second criterion of the\n14 Berkovitz–Gaubert test.”).\n15 Here, as a general matter, a decision not to remove a child from the custody of a parent\n16 involves elements of judgment and choice, and Osemwengie’s choice not to remove the children\n17 from the custody of their parents was grounded on public policy concerns as expressed in the\n18 Nevada Revised Statutes.  Plaintiffs have not alleged malice, but rather only negligence, however\n19 gross.  As terrible as the situation is, and as negligent as Osemwengie might have been (assuming\n20 Plaintiffs’ evidence is true), the discretionary immunity statute might still protect Osemwengie\n21 from civil liability.  \n22 On the other hand, Plaintiffs are correct that Osemwengie had a statutory duty to\n23 investigate reports of child abuse or neglect. See Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 432B.260, 432B.300. \n24 Plaintiffs note that Osemwengie did not investigate after receiving the emails from the father to\n25 the boys and the pornographic magazine.  That is, after she received the evidence, she closed the\nPage 23 of  26\n\n1 case and chose not to further investigate, without even looking at the additional evidence, based\n2 upon her previous visit to the father’s home and observation of the boys there.  The Court accepts\n3 Plaintiffs’ argument that failing to take any further action to investigate after receiving the\n4 previously unexamined evidence could constitute a failure to investigate under the statute, which\n5 is a mandated task, the failure of which would prevent Osemwengie from asserting the qualified\n6 immunity defense.  The Court therefore intends to leave it to the jury whether Osemwengie\n7 satisfied her statutory duty to investigate in this case.  A reasonable jury could decide the issue\n8 either way based upon the evidence currently adduced.\n9 C. Motion to Disqualify Counsel \n10 County Defendants ask the Court to disqualify three of Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the\n11 National Center for Youth Law (“NCYL”).  Defendants report that in November 2013, an\n12 attorney for NCYL not associated with the present case, Kate Walker, approached Faiza\n13 Ebrahim, a managerial and supervisory employee of CCDFS, and, without identifying herself or\n14 her organization’s involvement in the case, and knowing that Ebrahim was an employee of\n15 represented party CCDFS, solicited information relevant to the present case.  Plaintiffs argue that\n16 this violated Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct 4.2 and/or 4.3:\n17 Rule 4.2.  In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the\nsubject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by\n18 another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or\nis authorized to do so by law or a court order.\n19\nRule 4.3.  Dealing With Unrepresented Person.  In dealing on behalf of a\n20 client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or\nimply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should\n21 know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer’s role in the matter,\nthe lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding. The lawyer\n22 shall not give legal advice to an unrepresented person, other than the advice to secure\ncounsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such a\n23 person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of\nthe client.\n24\n25\nPage 24 of  26\n\n1 Nev. R. Prof. Conduct 4.2, 4.3.  Plaintiffs support the allegations with the affidavit and\n2 deposition transcript of Ms. Ebrahim.  Defendants allege that Walker was aware of Ms.\n3 Ebrahim’s employment by CCDFS when she approached her and purposely did not identify\n4 herself or her organization’s involvement in the case until after soliciting the relevant\n5 information.  Defendants allege that the information solicited was then used by other NCYL\n6 attorneys to question Ebrahim at her deposition two months later.  Defendants note that NCYL’s\n7 attorney’s are bound by Nevada’s ethics rules under Local Rule IA 10-7(a).  \n8 Plaintiffs respond that Ebrahim is not an employee of CCDFS and that Ms. Walker has\n9 done no work on the present case.  Defendants reply that the attorneys working on the case had a\n10 duty to supervise Ms. Walker and to correct any violations that might have occurred.  Plaintiffs\n11 also respond that Ms. Ebrahim is an employee not of CCDFS, but of the Southern Nevada\n12 Children’s Assessment Center (“SNCAC”), which is a “Clark County entity that is not a party to\n13 this action.”  Defendants’ reply is not entirely clear, but they appear to argue that Ms. Ebrahim is\n14 an employee of SNCAC, which is an arm of the County.  \n15 The Court finds that it must hold an evidentiary hearing.  If the allegations are true, an\n16 appropriate sanction would be the exclusion of any fruits of the violation, plus the\n17 disqualification of any NCYL attorney who directed the improper conduct or ratified it by using\n18 the improper information at the deposition or by not reporting the violation to the Court.  In order\n19 to sort out the relevant facts—whether a violation occurred, who knew about it, and when—the\n20 Court will have to question Ms. Ebrahim, NCYL’s two current attorneys, plus Ms. Walker at the\n21 May 15, 2014 hearing in Las Vegas.  These persons (Faiza Ebrahim, Kate Walker, Erin Liotta,\n22 and Leecia Welch) must therefore appear at the May 15, 2015 hearing.\n23 ///\n24 ///\n25 ///\nPage 25 of  26\n\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss or Stay and to Transfer Venue\n3 (ECF No. 280) is GRANTED IN PART, and the First Amended Third-Party Complaint (ECF\n4 No. 267) is DISMISSED as against National Deaf Academy, LLC.\n5 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for Jurisdictional Discovery (ECF No. 394)\n6 is DENIED.\n7 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Faiza Ebrahim, Kate Walker, Erin Liotta, and Leecia\n8 Welch must appear at the May 15, 2015 hearing prepared to testify as to the Motion to Disqualify\n9 Counsel (ECF No. 313).\n10 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n11 Dated this 7th day of May, 2014.\n12         _____________________________________\n      ROBERT C.

The Court has\n15\nreviewed Defendants’ Motion and the pleadings on file from all parties.  IT IS HEREBY\n16\nORDERED that Defendants’ Motion is denied.\n17\nBACKGROUND.\n18\nIn August 2006, Plaintiffs1 filed suit on behalf of themselves and “all abused and\n19\nneglected children who are in, or at risk of entering, the Clark County foster care system.”  (#57-\n20\n1 at 6).  Plaintiffs bring this civil action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Kenny C. Guinn, as\n21\n22\n23\n1 Plaintiffs proceed under fictitious names pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a).  The named Plaintiffs\ninclude Clark K. (by his next friend Sherry Anderson), Jalen, Sia, Roshaun, Caleb, and King A. (collectively the “A\n24\nPlaintiffs”) (by their next friend Tarrah Logan), Toni Summer and Frank B. (collectively the “B Plaintiffs”) (by their\nnext friend Marilyn Paikai), and Donna C. (by her next friend Jacquelyn Romero).\n25\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 271   Filed 10/24/08   Page 2 of 6\n1 Nevada Governor (the Court dismissed Mr. Guinn from the case),2  Michael Wilden (Director\n2 of Nevada Health and Human Services), Fernand Serrano (Administrator of the Nevada Division\n3 of Child and Family Services), John Doe (Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Services for Child Care\n4 of the Division of Child and Family Services), Virginia Valentine (Clark County Manager),\n5 Clark  County  Department  of  Family  Services,  Tom  Morton  (Director  of  Clark  County\n6 Department of Family Services), Louis Palma (Manager of Shelter Care for the Clark County\n7 Department of Family Services), County Commissioners Bruce L. Woodbury, Tom Collins, Chip\n8 Maxfield, Yvonne Atkinson Gates, Myrna Williams, Lynette Boggs McDonald, and Rory Reid,\n9 and finally Clark County itself.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the\n10 operation of Nevada’s and Clark County’s foster care system.  \n11 On May 14, 2007, this Court issued a lengthy order in which it dismissed the Governor\n12 completely from this action.  The Court further dismissed some of Plaintiff’s claims for failure\n13 to state a claim. \n14 Plaintiffs now seek to certify  a county-wide class consisting of all children “who have\n15 been, are, or will be victims in the legal custody of Clark County Department of Family\n16 Services.”  (#74 at 4).  Plaintiffs claim that the only realistic means for redressing the injuries\n17 suffered by the thousands of children who are members of the class” is to prosecute this matter\n18 as a class action.  Id.  According to Plaintiffs, “reliance upon any one class member’s claims will\n19 not effectively remedy the class-wide issues raised in this suit.”  Id.  Plaintiffs further state that\n20 “if this action does not proceed as a class action, these foster children will be unable to address\n21 the system-wide deficits that have caused their injuries.”  Id.  \n22 Defendants also seek review and reconsideration of Judge Johnston’s orders compelling\n23\n2 As of today’s date, Governor Guinn is no longer Governor.  This fact does not dismiss the Governor’s office from\n24\nthis action.  When a public officer who is sued in the officer’s official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to\nhold office, the action does not abate and the successor is automatically substituted as Defendant.  Hafer v. Melo,\n25\n502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991). \nPage 2 of  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 271   Filed 10/24/08   Page 3 of 6\n1 discovery of case files and the parties’ entry into protective order.  Judge Johnston ordered the\n2 parties to enter into a confidentiality agreement and Defendants to disclose case files in the\n3 possession of the County for the children named in the lawsuit.  The case files would be\n4 delivered only to the attorney representing the child.\n5 On February 12, 2007, the Court stated that more discovery was needed before the Court\n6 ruled on class certification.  Since then disputes have arisen as to the scope of discovery required,\n7 the parties took these issues before Judge Johnston.  \n8 On March 12, 2008, Judge Johnston ruled that the Court would allow discovery of the\n9 non-privileged documents containing “(1) case records for all foster children who have been the\n10 subject of an abuse or neglect [claim] while in the custody of Clark County; and (2) case records\n11 for children who have died or suffered abuse while in the custody of Clark County.” (#187). \n12 Judge Johnston also held that the official information privilege did not apply to the documents\n13 described above.  Id.\n14 DISCUSSION.\n15 The district court may not set aside a magistrate's determination of a non-dispositive\n16 pretrial matter unless it finds the order “to be clearly erroneous or contrary to law.”  FED. R. CIV.\n17 P. 72(a) (2006); see also Premiere Digital Access, Inc. v. Cent. Tel. Co., 360 F. Supp. 2d 1168,\n18 1172 (D. Nev. 2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and  FED. R. CIV. P. 72(a)).  In the District\n19 Court of Nevada, courts have said “the district judge must affirm the magistrate judge unless it\n20 is left with the ‘definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’”  Premiere\n21 Digital Access, Inc., F. Supp. 2d at 1172 (quoting Burdick v. Comm’r, 979 F.2d 1369, 130 (9th\n22 Cir. 1992)).  Furthermore, “[t]he reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that\n23 of the deciding court.”  Id.3  \n24\n      3 Under Local Rule IB 3-1, a district judge may reconsider any pretrial matter referred by a magistrate judge    \n25\n        “where it has been shown that the Magistrate’s judge ruling is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.” \nPage 3 of  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 271   Filed 10/24/08   Page 4 of 6\n1 I. Judge Johnston’s Order Is Not Clearly Erroneous. \n2 Defendants contend that Judge Johnston’s orders are erroneous in that they exceed the\n3 scope of discovery required to fulfill this Court’s directive that further discovery be conducted\n4 to determine whether Plaintiffs “presented representative claims that represent the violations that\n5 you’re [plaintiffs] talking about class wide.”  (Transcript of Feb. 12, 2007 Hearing, at 60–61). \n6 A. Judge Johnston’s Orders Are in Harmony with the Court’s Statements\nRelating to Class Certification.\n7\nDefendants focus on the Court’s use of the words “a little bit of discovery” to argue that\n8\nJudge Johnston exceeded the scope of the intended discovery.  Under the Federal Rules of Civil\n9\nProcedure, “the scope of discovery is broad and should be allowed unless the information had\n10\nno conceivable bearing on the case.”  Jackson v. Montgomery Ward & Co. Inc., 173 F.R.D. 524,\n11\n528 (D. Nev. 1997).  The Court did not give any specific direction regarding the scope of the\n12\ndiscovery, only that discovery was needed to insure that claims were representative across the\n13\nclass.  Judge Johnston directed County Defendants to produce the case records of other foster\n14\nchildren whom may have suffered abuse or neglect similar to that suffered by the named\n15\nPlaintiff.   The Orders granting the Plaintiffs’ Motions to Compel are in harmony with the\n16\nCourt’s mandate that further discovery be conducted regarding the class and the claims of the\n17\nclass.  \n18\nB. Pre-Certification Discovery is Proper for Class Issues.\n19\nIn the Ninth Circuit plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on class issues before the class has\n20\nbeen fully certified.  Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2007).  In Dukes, six\n21\nwomen filed a class action suit alleging employment discrimination.   Id. at 1174.   In preparation\n22\nfor their motion for class certification, the plaintiffs conducted “extensive” and wide-ranging pre-\n23\ncertification discovery.  Id. at 1175.  The discovery included detailed expert testimony and\n24\nstatistical data.  To establish class certification,  plaintiffs presented information on potential\n25\nPage 4 of  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 271   Filed 10/24/08   Page 5 of 6\nclass members and statements from individual class representatives.  Id. at 1182 & n.11.  The\n1\nNinth Circuit held that the information presented on potential class members was significant in\n2\nsupporting commonality and must be considered.  Id. at 1177 n.2, 1182.  \n3\nWhen a court concludes, as this Court has, that it requires factual support before it can\n4\neffectively address class certification, class-related discovery is essential.  Gray v. First Winthrop\n5\nCorp., 133 F.R.D. 39, 40–41.  As to any overlap between class-related discovery and the merits\n6\nof the case, the Ninth Circuit visited that issue in Dukes.  Dukes, 509 F.3d at 1178 n.2 (stating\n7\nthat even if the evidence relates to the underlying merits of the case, the district court must allow\n8\ndiscovery addressing the class certification requirements).  \n9\nII. The Orders Are Not Contrary to Law.\n10\nDefendants claim that Judge Johnston erred in holding that the Plaintiffs’ attorneys in this\n11\ncase are “attorneys” within the meaning of Nevada Revised Statute § 432B.290(1)(g).  The\n12\nstatute states:\n13\nExcept as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and 3 and NRS 432B.165,\n14\n432B.175 and 432B.513, data or information concerning reports and\ninvestigations  thereof  made  pursuant  to  this  chapter  may  be  made\n15\navailable only to . . . [t]he attorney and the guardian ad litem of the child.\n16\nN.R.S. § 432B.290(1)(g) (2007).  In this case Judge Johnston ordered certain files to be turned\n17\nover to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  For the purposes of this case, Plaintiffs’ Counsel is proposing that\n18\nthey serve as counsel for the class of persons in the Complaint.  Courts follow the plain language\n19\nof the statute when the language is clear.  McKay v. Board of Supervisors of Carson City, 730\n20\nP.2d 438, 441 (Nev. 1996).  Based on the language of the statute, counsel may be considered to\n21\nbe the child’s attorney.  Other interpretations would bar the discovery needed for the class to be\n22\ncertified.  \n23\nFurthermore, Judge Johnston correctly interpreted Nevada Revised Statute § 432B.290(2)\n24\n(which governs information made available to the general public).  Judge Johnston held that the\n25\nPage 5 of  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-01068-RCJ-RJJ   Document 271   Filed 10/24/08   Page 6 of 6\n“plaintiffs are not requesting the information in an attempt to disclose it to the public” and he\n1\nconcluded that Nevada Revised Statute § 432B.290(2) does not apply.  Defendants rely on an\n2\norder by Judge Herndon interpreting the same statute.  But Judge Johnston held that the statute,\n3\nwhich provides a lengthy list of exceptions allowing for the disclosure of confidential files, does\n4\nnot  merit  the  broad  reading  preferred  by  Defendants.    Furthermore,  Judge  Herndon’s\n5\ninterpretation is moot due to the 2007 amendment of Nevada Revised Statute § 432B.290(2).  \n6\nCONCLUSION.\n7\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (#192) is\n8\ndenied. Judge Johnston’s Orders are consistent with the Court’s orders and the law.\n9\nDATED: October 24, 2008\n10\n11\n                                                                     \n12\n      ROBERT C.
