The FCRA also requires that, before denying or revoking a job offer based on background check results, employers must provide the applicant with a copy of the background check and a statement of rights under the FCRA, and give the applicant a reasonable amount of time to respond to the accuracy of the report. Hertz never provided the plaintiffs with a disclosure that it may obtain consumer reports and did not receive the plaintiffs' authorization for such reports. </p><p>The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.

Hertz routinely rejects job applicants, including Mr. Lee, based on information \n10  contained in background check reports (“consumer reports”) that it obtains from background \n11  check companies called “consumer reporting agencies” or “CRAs,” such as Sterling.    \n12  3.  In doing so, Hertz fails to strictly comply with federal law governing the \n13  procurement and use of consumer reports for employment purposes. \n14  4.  Sterling, one of the largest consumer reporting agencies in the United States, \n15  provides consumer reports to companies, including Hertz, to be used for employment purposes, \n16  such as making hiring decisions. \n17  5.  In doing so, Sterling fails to strictly comply with federal law governing the \n18  procurement and use of consumer reports for employment purposes. \n19  6.  Specifically, Hertz systematically violates section 1681b(b)(3)(A) of the FCRA \n20  by using consumer reports to make adverse employment decisions without first providing the \n21  applicant who is the subject of the report with sufficient and timely notification of its intent to \n22  take an adverse action, a copy of the report, and a summary of the applicants’ rights under the \n23  FCRA.  15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(i) and (ii). \n24  7.  Sterling also violates section 1681b(b)(3)(A) of the FCRA by failing to timely \n25  provide applicants with appropriate pre-adverse action disclosures, including a copy of the \n26  relevant consumer report and a written description of the applicant’s rights under the FCRA, in \n27  violation of FCRA, 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(i) and (ii). \n28 \n- 2 -  \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA      \n \n \n \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page3 of 23\n \n1  8.  Before procuring consumer reports from Sterling and/or other CRAs, Hertz also \n2  fails to inform job applicants in a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing, in a document that \n3  consists solely of the disclosure, that it may procure a consumer report for employment purposes, \n4  in violation of U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i).  \n5  9.  Hertz similarly fails to obtain authorization of job applicants in writing to procure \n6  such consumer reports, in violation of U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2(A)(ii). \n7  10.  Sterling has further violated the FCRA by failing to notify job applicants when it \n8  furnishes consumer reports that are likely to adversely affect the applicants’ ability to obtain \n9  employment and failing to follow strict procedures to ensure the timely and complete nature of \n10  those reports, in violation of U.S.C. § 1681k(a).  \n11  11.  Defendants have violated the above-mentioned provisions of the FCRA willfully \n12  and pursuant to their respective companywide policies and procedures.   \n13  12.  On behalf of himself and others similarly situated, Plaintiff seeks injunctive and \n14  declaratory relief; statutory and/or actual damages; punitive damages; pre-judgment and post-\n15  judgment interest; and reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses associated with this action. \n16  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17  13.  This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s FCRA claims \n18  pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681p and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  \n19  14.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a \n20  substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims alleged herein occurred in \n21  this District.  \n22  15.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over this matter because Defendants conduct \n23  substantial business activity in this District, and because many of the unlawful acts described \n24  herein occurred in this District and gave rise to the claims alleged. \n25  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n26  16.  A substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the claims \n27  occurred in San Francisco County and/or adjacent counties in the San Francisco Division, and \n28 \n- 3 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page4 of 23\n \n1  therefore this action is properly assigned to the San Francisco Division pursuant to Local Rule 3-\n2  2(c),(d). \n3  PARTIES \n4  Plaintiff \n5    Peter Lee \n6  17.  Plaintiff Peter Lee is an African-American man who lives in Richmond, \n7  California.   \n8  18.  In May 2014, while employed in a similar position with a competing company, \n9  Mr. Lee applied and interviewed for the position of counter sales representative with Hertz’s \n10  Dollar/Thrifty-branched rental car location at the San Francisco International Airport.   \n11  19.  Mr. Lee and other Hertz job applicants are “consumers” as defined by the FCRA, \n12  15 U.S.C. § 1681a(c). \n13  Defendants \n14    Hertz Corporation \n15  20.  Hertz Corporation operates the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental brands \n16  in more than 11,000 corporate and licensee locations in approximately 140 countries.  \n17  21.  Hertz Corporation is the largest worldwide airport general use car rental company \n18  with more than 1,700 airport locations in the U.S. \n19  22.  Hertz Corporation is registered as a Delaware corporation and maintains its \n20  headquarters at 999 Vanderbilt Beach Road in Naples, Florida.   \n21  23.  Hertz Corporation owns and operates the relevant Dollar/Thrifty-branded car \n22  rental office located at the San Francisco International Airport at 780 McDonnell Road, San \n23  Francisco, California, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, \n24  Inc. \n25  24.  At all relevant times, Hertz  Corporation has been a “person” using “consumer \n26  reports” of Mr. Lee and similarly situated applicants for “employment purposes,” and has taken \n27  “adverse action” against Plaintiff and similarly situated applicants, as defined under 15 U.S.C. § \n28 \n- 4 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page5 of 23\n \n1  1681a.  These adverse actions have been based wholly or in part on those consumer reports.  \n2  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group  \n3  25.  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. is wholly owned and operated by the Hertz \n4  Corporation. \n5  26.  There are approximately 340 Dollar and Thrifty corporate locations in the United \n6  States and Canada. \n7  27.  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. is a Delaware Corporation and maintains it \n8  headquarters at 5330 E. 31st Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma. \n9  28.  At all relevant times, Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. has been a “person” \n10  using “consumer reports” of Mr. Lee and similarly situated applicants for “employment \n11  purposes,” and has taken “adverse action” against Plaintiff and similarly situated applicants, as \n12  defined under 15 U.S.C. § 1681a.  These adverse actions have been based wholly or in part on \n13  those consumer reports.  \n14  Sterling \n15  29.  Sterling is a private New York-based corporation self-described as “the world’s \n16  largest company focused entirely on background checks,” with some 20,000 customers and \n17  2,700 employees spread among offices in the United States, Canada, the U.K., India, and the \n18  Philippines. \n19  30.  Sterling has enjoyed exponential growth over the past 15 years, with annual \n20  revenue increasing from approximately $7.5 million in 2001 to $250 million in 2013, as \n21  employers increasingly conduct background checks on prospective and current employees. \n22  Sterling’s founder and chief executive officer stated in 2013 that he expected the company to \n23  surpass $1 billion in annual revenue by 2018. \n24  31.  Through a combination of organic growth, an influx in investment capital, and \n25  aggressive pursuit of competitor agencies and complementary firms, Sterling has greatly \n26  expanded its geographic reach, consumer report volume, and annual revenue over the past 15 \n27  years. \n28 \n- 5 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page6 of 23\n \n1  32.  As of 2013, Sterling conducted a reported 16 million background searches every \n2  year for employers.    \n3  33.  Sterling has maintained an operational center in Mumbai, India since at least \n4  2006.  In November 2013, Sterling reportedly consolidated its global operations there, and \n5  entrusted an executive in the Mumbai office with oversight over global quality assurance in \n6  consumer reports (including the duty to ensure reports’ accuracy and timeliness). \n7  34.  Sterling is a “consumer reporting agency” for purposes of FCRA compliance \n8  pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(f), and a “person” as described in 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(a).   \n9  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n10  Background Information  \n11  35.  Sterling is among the largest of the nation’s employment background screening \n12  companies, i.e., those that provide “consumer reports,” as defined by 15 U.S.C. § \n13  1681a(d)(1)(B), to employers. \n14  36.  In order to provide these consumer reports, Sterling investigates and reviews \n15  public record databases and assembles and/or maintains consumer files which contain public \n16  record information concerning, among other things, the alleged criminal record history of \n17  individuals.  Sterling then sells this information to employers, including Hertz. \n18  37.  Upon information and belief, as part of the services Sterling offers to its employer \n19  customers, Sterling agrees to send FCRA- required “pre-adverse action” notices to consumers on \n20  behalf of its employer-customers.  Upon information and belief, Hertz has contracted with \n21  Sterling to provide this service. \n22  Plaintiff Lee’s Experience \n23  38.  In June 2012, while in Richmond, California, visiting relatives, Mr. Lee was \n24  arrested.  \n25  39.  Mr. Lee was subsequently charged with felony possession of a controlled \n26  substance for sale with a gang enhancement (the “June 2012 charges”). \n27  40.  While the June 2012 charges were pending, in May 2014, Hertz personnel \n28 \n- 6 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page7 of 23\n \n1  recruited Mr. Lee to interview for a counter sales representative position with Hertz at its Dollar/ \n2  Thrifty-branded car rental location at San Francisco International Airport. \n3  41.  At the time Hertz recruited him for a position with the company, Mr. Lee worked \n4  for a competitor car rental company in a similar position. \n5  42.  Mr. Lee interviewed for the position with Hertz sometime in the first half of May \n6  2014.  At the close of the interview, Mr. Lee was given an offer of employment, pending the \n7  processing of his application materials. \n8  43.  To begin this process, a Hertz representative instructed Mr. Lee to complete an \n9  online application by following a link sent to him via email.   \n10  44.  Mr. Lee completed the online application as instructed. \n11  45.  On May 15, 2014, Mr. Lee received an email from Kimberly Kowallis (“Ms. \n12  Kowallis”), a field recruiter for Hertz, confirming his conditional offer of employment. \n13  46.  On May 27, 2014, after Mr. Lee had passed Hertz’s mandatory drug screening, he \n14  received an email from Ms. Kowallis with a link to an addendum to the Hertz application \n15  specific to California and Hawaii.  The email requested that Mr. Lee complete the online \n16  application addendum.   \n17  47.  Mr. Lee completed the online application addendum as instructed.   \n18  48.  Also on May 27, 2014, Mr. Lee received an email from Ms. Kowallis with the \n19  subject line “Hertz Orientation Package.”  This email provided information about Mr. Lee’s \n20  onboarding with Hertz. \n21  49.  Ms. Kowallis subsequently scheduled Mr. Lee to begin working for Hertz on June \n22  9, 2014.  After receiving confirmation of his start date with Hertz, Mr. Lee provided a notice of \n23  resignation, effective June 9, 2014, to his then-current employer.  \n24  50.  At some point during the processing of Mr. Lee’s application, Hertz obtained one \n25  or more consumer reports from Sterling containing information about Mr. Lee’s background, one \n26  or more of which included information regarding the June 2012 criminal charges pending against \n27  Mr. Lee. \n28 \n- 7 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page8 of 23\n \n1  51.  At no point during the processing of his employment application did Hertz \n2  provide Mr. Lee with a clear and conspicuous disclosure in the form of a written document that \n3  consisted solely of the disclosure, that it may obtain a consumer report for employment purposes, \n4  as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i). \n5  52.  Likewise, at no point during the processing of Mr. Lee’s employment application \n6  did Hertz obtain Mr. Lee’s authorization in the form of a written document for the procurement \n7  of a consumer report, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(ii). \n8  53.  On June 3, 2014, Mr. Lee received a call from Ms. Kowallis informing him that \n9  Hertz would not hire him because of the criminal history information contained in his \n10  background check.  Ms. Kowallis told Mr. Lee that she could not do anything about his rejection \n11  because the decision was based on “Hertz policy.”   \n12  54.  Mr. Lee asked Ms. Kowallis for a copy of the background check information that \n13  Hertz had obtained and was instructed to contact Sterling. \n14  55.  Later that same day, Mr. Lee received an email from Ms. Kowallis confirming \n15  that Hertz had, indeed, rescinded his job offer because he did not meet the company’s \n16  “background qualifications.”  \n17  56.  As a result of the criminal history information contained in the consumer report it \n18  procured from Sterling, Hertz stopped the onboarding process, and did not move forward with \n19  the job that it had offered Mr. Lee. \n20  57.  After Ms. Kowallis informed Mr. Lee that he would not be hired because of \n21  criminal history information contained in his background check on June 3, 2014, Mr. Lee \n22  contacted Sterling by phone and requested a copy of the consumer report that Sterling provided \n23  to Hertz in connection with Mr. Lee’s application for employment. \n24  58.  In response to Mr. Lee’s request, sometime on or after June 3, 2014, Sterling sent \n25  Mr. Lee by regular mail a copy of a consumer report prepared by Sterling, which included \n26  information about the June 2012 charges (the “June 3rd package”).  Mr. Lee did not receive a \n27  copy the June 3rd package until sometime after June 3, 2014. \n28 \n- 8 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page9 of 23\n \n1  59.  Sometime on or after June 4, 2014, Sterling sent to Mr. Lee by regular mail an \n2  undated letter that was inaccurately entitled “Pre-Adverse Action Notice,” and which bore Hertz \n3  corporate logo (the “June 4th Letter'”).  Enclosed with the June 4th letter was a copy of a \n4  consumer report prepared by Sterling dated June 4, 2014, which contained information about the \n5  June 2012 charges. \n6  60.  Mr. Lee did not receive the June 4th Letter, which upon information and belief, \n7  was sent by Sterling pursuant to its contract with Hertz, until sometime after June 4, 2014. \n8  61.  The June 4th Letter informed Mr. Lee that, based on a “Criminal Report” \n9  provided by Sterling, Hertz was considering revoking Mr. Lee’s conditional offer of \n10  employment, subject to Mr. Lee successfully challenging the accuracy of the criminal report \n11  information. \n12  62.  At the time that Sterling mailed Mr. Lee the June 3rd package and the June 4th \n13  letter (as well as at the time Mr. Lee received them), however, Sterling had already provided \n14  Hertz with a copy of Mr. Lee’s consumer report containing information about the June 2012 \n15  criminal charges, and Hertz had already revoked Mr. Lee’s conditional offer of employment \n16  based upon information contained in that consumer report. \n17  Factual Allegations Common to All Class Members \n18  63.  Employers commonly use criminal background screening reports to determine \n19  employment eligibility.  A significant percentage of these reports, however, contain incomplete, \n20  inaccurate, misleading, or improper records that can erroneously disqualify a job applicant or \n21  employee.  Recognizing this danger, Congress provided strict reporting and disclosure \n22  requirements in the FCRA to ensure that prospective employees have the opportunity to review \n23  reports summarizing their background information and to contest any inaccuracies and illegal \n24  disclosures and/or provide additional information before these reports influence employment \n25  decisions.   \n26  64.  The FCRA requires that “before taking any adverse action based in whole or in \n27  part on [a consumer report],” the employer taking the adverse action must provide “the consumer \n28 \n- 9 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page10 of 23\n \n1  to whom the report relates” with: \n2   \n(i)  a copy of the report; and \n3 \n(ii) a description in writing of the rights of the consumer under this subchapter, as \nprescribed by the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau under section \n4 \n1681g(c)(3). \n5 \n15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(i) and (ii).  \n6 \n65.  The FCRA defines adverse action as either “a denial of employment or any other \n7 \ndecision for employment purposes that adversely affects any current or prospective employee,” \n8 \nor “any action taken or determination that is . . . adverse to the interests of the consumer.”  15 \n9 \nU.S.C. §§ 1681a(k)(l)(B).   \n10 \n66.  A consumer reporting agency’s delivery of a consumer report containing \n11 \ninformation likely to prove detrimental to the consumer’s ability to secure employment is an \n12 \n“adverse action” in itself under this section.  See Mattiaccio v. DHA Grp., Inc., No. 12 Civ. 1249, \n13 \n2014 WL 717780, at *6 (D.D.C. Feb. 26, 2014) (citing Adams v. Nat’l Eng’g Serv. Corp., 620 F. \n14 \nSupp. 2d 319, 332 (D. Conn. 2009) (summary judgment denied on grounds that a reasonable jury \n15 \ncould deem CRA’s delivery of negative consumer report a FCRA “adverse action”)).  \n16 \n67.  Hertz and Sterling have routinely and systematically failed to provide Plaintiff \n17 \nand other job applicants with a copy of their consumer reports prior to taking adverse actions \n18 \nagainst them. \n19 \n68.  Hertz and Sterling further have routinely and systematically failed to provide \n20 \nPlaintiff and other job applicants with a summary of their rights under the FCRA prior to taking \n21 \nadverse actions against them. \n22 \n69.  The FCRA also requires that employers “may not procure a consumer report or \n23 \ncause a consumer report to be procured, for employment purposes with respect to any \n24 \nconsumer,” unless: \n25 \n \n26  (i)  a clear and conspicuous disclosure has been made in writing to the consumer at \nany time before the report is procured or caused to be procured, in a document \n27 \n28 \n- 10 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page11 of 23\n \nthat consists solely of the disclosure, that a consumer report may be obtained for \n1 \nemployment purposes; and  \n \n2 \n(ii)  the consumer has authorized in writing (which authorization may be made on the \n3  document referred to in clause (i)) the procurement of the report by that person. \n4  15 U.S.C. § 1681b(B)(2)(A)(i) and (ii).   \n5  70.  Hertz routinely and systematically violates these provisions by failing to (1) \n6  provide “clear and conspicuous” disclosures in writing, in a document that consists solely of the \n7  disclosures, that a consumer report may be obtained and (2) obtain applicants’ authorization in \n8  writing to procure a consumer reports for employment purposes.   \n9  71.  Finally, the FCRA mandates that any consumer reporting agency that “furnishes a \n10  consumer report for employment purposes” and, in so doing, “compiles and reports items of \n11  information on consumers which are matters of public record and are likely to have an adverse \n12  effect upon the consumer’s ability to obtain employment” shall: \n13   \n1)  at the time such public record information is reported to the user of such \n14 \nconsumer report, notify the consumer of the fact that public record \ninformation is being reported by the consumer reporting agency, together with \n15 \nthe name and address of the person to whom such information is being \nreported; or \n16 \n \n17  2)  maintain strict procedures designed to [ensure] that whenever public record \ninformation which is likely to have an adverse effect on a consumer’s ability \n18 \nto obtain employment is reported it is complete and up to date. \n19  15 U.S.C. § 1681k(a)(1) and (2).  \n20  72.  Sterling routinely and systematically fails to provide consumers with timely \n21  notice of its reporting of public-record information likely to have an adverse effect on the \n22  consumer’s ability to obtain employment.  Sterling also routinely and systematically fails to \n23  maintain strict procedures to ensure that the public record information that it reports is complete \n24  and current.  See Poore v. Sterling Testing Sys., 410 F. Supp. 2d 557, 572 (E.D. Ky. 2006) \n25  (expressing concern over the absence of “any information regarding any procedures that Sterling \n26  may employ to ensure” the accuracy of information received from various subsidiaries and \n27 \n28 \n- 11 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page12 of 23\n \n1  affiliates); Jones v. Sterling Infosystems, Inc., No. 14-cv-3076 (S.D.N.Y.). \n2  73.   In failing to fulfill either of these obligations, Sterling systematically violates 15 \n3  U.S.C. § 1681k(a).  \n4  74.  Defendants have acted willfully in violating the requirements of the FCRA. \n5  Defendants knew or should have known about their obligations under the FCRA.  These \n6  obligations are well-established by the plain language of the FCRA and in the promulgations and \n7  opinion letters of the Federal Trade Commission. \n8  75.   Despite Defendants’ awareness of their legal obligations, Defendants have acted \n9  consciously in breaching their known duties and depriving Plaintiff and other job applicants of \n10  their rights under the FCRA.  \n11  76.  At a minimum, Defendants’ conduct has been reckless in failing to make an \n12  appropriate inquiry to ascertain its obligations under the FCRA. \n13  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n14 \n77.  Mr. Lee brings this Class Action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n15 \n23 on behalf of himself and five classes of persons. \n16 \n78.  Plaintiff asserts the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action against \n17 \nHertz and Sterling on behalf of the “FCRA Consumer Report Copy Class” and “FCRA Summary \n18 \nof Rights Class” defined as follows: \n19 \n \n20 \nFCRA Consumer Report Copy Class: All applicants for employment with \nHertz in the United States within five years of the filing of this complaint through \n21 \nthe date of final judgment who were subject to an adverse action based in whole \n22  or in part on information contained in a consumer report without receiving a copy \nof the consumer report at least five business days prior to the adverse action, as \n23  required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(i). \n \n24 \nFCRA Summary of Rights Class: All applicants for employment with Hertz in \nthe United States within five years of the filing of this complaint through the date \n25 \nof final judgment who were subject to an adverse action based in whole or in part \n26  on information contained in a consumer report without receiving a written \ndescription of their rights under the FCRA at least five business days prior to the \n27  adverse action, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(ii). \n28 \n- 12 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page13 of 23\n \n \n1 \n79.  Plaintiff asserts the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action against Hertz on behalf of \n2 \nthe “FCRA Disclosure Class” and the “FCRA Authorization Class” defined as follows: \n3 \n \n4 \nFCRA Disclosure Class: All applicants for employment with Hertz in the United \nStates within five years of the filing of this complaint through the date of final \n5 \njudgment about whom Hertz procured a consumer report without providing a \n6  clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing, in a document that consisted solely of \nthe disclosure, prior to procuring the consumer report, as required by 15 U.S.C. § \n7 \n1681b(b)(2)(A)(i). \n \n8 \nFCRA Authorization Class: All applicants for employment with Hertz in the \nUnited States within five years of the filing of this complaint through the date of \n9 \nfinal judgment about whom Hertz procured a consumer report without obtaining \n10  the applicants’ authorization in writing prior to procuring the consumer report, as \nrequired by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(ii). \n11 \n80.  Plaintiff asserts the Seventh Cause of Action against Sterling on behalf of the \n12 \n“Adverse Public-Record Information Class” defined as follows: \n13 \n \n14 \nAdverse Public-Record Information Class: All applicants for employment with \nHertz in the United States, except for in New York State, within five years of the \n15 \nfiling of this complaint through the date of final judgment about whom Sterling \n16  delivered a consumer report to Hertz containing public-record information likely \nto adversely affect the applicant’s ability to obtain employment without either \n17  providing advance notice to the affected applicant or maintaining strict procedures \nto ensure the information reported was complete and up to date, as required by 15 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 1681k(a).  \n \n19 \n81.  The members of the FCRA Consumer Report Copy Class, FCRA Summary of \n20 \nRights Class, the FCRA Disclosure Class, the FCA Authorization Class, and the Adverse Public-\n21 \nRecord Information Class are collectively referred to as “Class Members.” \n22 \n82.  Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the definition of above-defined classes based \n23 \non discovery or legal developments. \n24 \n83.  The Class Members identified herein are so numerous that joinder of all members \n25 \nis impracticable.  Hertz employs over 30,000 workers worldwide, with the vast majority located \n26 \nwithin the United States.  Although Plaintiff does not know the precise number of job applicants \n27 \n28 \n- 13 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page14 of 23\n \n1  harmed by Defendants’ violations of FCRA, the number is far greater than feasibly could be \n2  addressed through joinder.  The precise number is also uniquely within Defendants’ possession. \n3  84.  There are questions of law and fact common to Class Members, and these \n4  questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  Common \n5  questions include, among others:   \n6   \na.  whether Defendants violated FCRA by taking adverse action, based \n7 \nwholly or in part on information contained a consumer report, against \nPlaintiff and other members of the FCRA Consumer Report Copy \n8 \nClass without first providing them with a copy of the consumer report \n9  and at least five business days to respond, as required by 15 U.S.C. § \n1681b(b)(3)(A)(i); \n10 \n \nb.  whether Defendants violated FCRA by taking adverse action, based \n11 \nwholly or in part on information contained in a consumer report, \nagainst Plaintiff and other members of the FCRA Summary of Rights \n12 \nClass without first providing them with a written summary of their \n13  rights under FCRA and at least five business days to respond, as \nrequired by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(ii); \n14 \n \nc.  whether Hertz violated FCRA by failing to provide Plaintiff and the \n15 \nFCRA Disclosure Class with a clear and conspicuous disclosure in \n16  writing, in a document that consisted solely of the disclosure, prior to \nprocuring their consumer reports for employment purposes, as \n17  required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i); \n \n18 \nd.  whether Hertz violated FCRA by failing to obtain from Plaintiff and \nthe FCRA Authorization Class authorization in writing prior to \n19 \nprocuring their consumer reports for employment purposes, as \n20  required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(ii); \n \n21  e.  whether Sterling violated FCRA by failing either to inform Plaintiff of \nthe Adverse Public-Record Information Class of its intent to deliver \n22 \npublic-record information likely to adversely affect their ability to \nobtain employment or to maintain strict procedures sufficient to ensure \n23 \nthat the adverse public-record information was complete and up to \n24  date; \n \n25  f.  whether Defendants were willful in their noncompliance with the \nrequirements of FCRA; \n26 \n \n27 \n28 \n- 14 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page15 of 23\n \ng.  whether Defendants were negligent in their noncompliance with the \n1 \nrequirements of FCRA; and \n \n2 \nh.  whether equitable remedies, injunctive relief, statutory damages, \n3  compensatory damages, and punitive damages for Class Members are \nwarranted.  \n4 \n \n5  85.  Mr. Lee is a member of the classes he seeks to represent.  Defendants failed to \n6  provide Mr. Lee with a copy of the consumer report or a notice of his rights under FCRA prior to \n7  taking adverse action against him, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A) (i) and (ii). \n8  Additionally, Hertz failed to provide Mr. Lee with a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing, \n9  in a document consisting solely of the disclosure, or obtain from Mr. Lee authorization in writing \n10  to procure a consumer report for employment purposes prior to procuring such a report, as \n11  required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii).  Finally, Sterling failed to either inform Mr. \n12  Lee of its reporting to Hertz of public record information likely to adversely affect his ability to \n13  secure employment, or to maintain strict procedures sufficient to ensure that the information was \n14  complete and up to date, prior to delivering the information to Hertz, as required under 15 U.S.C. \n15  § 1681k(a).   \n16  86.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the classes he seeks to represent.  \n17  Upon information and belief, it is Defendants’ standard practice to take adverse action against \n18  applicants without first providing affected individuals with a copy of their consumer reports and \n19  a written summary of their rights under FCRA.  Additionally, upon information and belief, it is \n20  Hertz’s standard practice to procure consumer reports without first providing a clear and \n21  conspicuous disclosure in writing to applicants, in a document that consists solely of the \n22  disclosure, or obtaining their written authorization.  Finally, upon information and belief, it is \n23  Sterling’s standard practice to deliver to Hertz public-record information likely to prove \n24  detrimental to the ability of applicants to obtain employment without first (a) notifying the \n25  applicants of the fact that the public record information is being reported and the name and \n26  address of the recipient; or (b) maintaining strict procedures to ensure the information is \n27 \n28 \n- 15 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page16 of 23\n \n1  complete and up to date.  Mr. Lee is entitled to relief under the same causes of action as other \n2  Class Members.  \n3  87.  Mr. Lee will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class \n4  Members.  Mr. Lee has retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex class \n5  actions, employment litigation, and the intersection thereof.  There is no conflict between Mr. \n6  Lee and the Class Members.  \n7  88.  Class certification is appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n8  Procedure 23(b)(2) because the Defendants have acted and/or refused to act on grounds generally \n9  applicable to the Class Members, making declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate with \n10  respect to Mr. Lee and the Class Members as a whole.   The Class Members are entitled to \n11  injunctive relief to end Defendants’ common, uniform, unfair discriminatory—and illegal—\n12  policies and practices. \n13  89.   Class certification is also appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n14  23(b)(3) because common questions of fact and law predominate over any questions affecting \n15  only individual Class Members, and because a class action is superior to other available methods \n16  for the fair and efficient adjudication of this litigation.  Class Members have been damaged and \n17  are entitled to recovery as a result of Defendants’ uniform policies and practices.  Because \n18  Defendants have maintained a common policy of failing to properly inform Class Members of \n19  their rights under FCRA, many Class Members are likely unaware that their rights have been \n20  violated.  \n21  90.  The amount of each Class Member’s individual claim is also small compared to \n22  the expense and burden of individual prosecution of this litigation.  The FCRA has statutorily \n23  specified damages, which Class Members will prove at trial are warranted, that will render \n24  calculation of damages for Class Members highly straightforward.  The propriety and amount of \n25  punitive damages are based on Defendants’ conduct, making these issues common to Class \n26  Members.  \n27   \n28 \n- 16 -  \n \n    Complaint for Violations of FCRA \n  \n\nCase4:15-cv-02545-JSW   Document1   Filed06/09/15   Page17 of 23\n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n1 \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 \nHertz’s Failure to Provide Consumer Report Copy Prior to Taking Adverse Action \n3  (15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(3)(A)(i), Brought by Plaintiff on Behalf of  \nHimself and the FCRA Consumer Report Copy Class) \n4 \n91.
