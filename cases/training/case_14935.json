As we understood it, there were two sets of constitutional issues. \nThere was the Lau equal protection issue that had never been reached by the Supreme Court. The way the Lau \ncase went up it was both a Title VI case and an equal protection case. The equal protection argument was, is it \nper se a violation of the equal protection clause not to provide understandable instruction or bilingual \neducation. That issue was never reached by the Supreme Court. That’s the issue that we understood we \nexcised back in 1978. There was a second constitutional issue, which was the continuing effects of past \ndiscrimination issue. That one, which is related to the two statutory past discrimination claims I just referred to, \nto our minds always remained in the case. \n(emphasis added). \n \n3  Thus on Ms. Dasher’s showing we deal, it appears, with an exceedingly complex and important case prepared and \n  organized for trial by a law student. \nThe affidavit counsel filed in support of the motion reads: \nI, Susan Joyce Dasher, Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas, am the attorney representing the Texas \nEducation Agency and the State of Texas in the above entitled litigation. As the attorney for those Defendants, I \nhave been involved in the effort to consolidate sixteen lawsuits, seven of which have been filed in the last three \nweeks, and that effort has forced me to allow the organizational efforts of the bilingual trial to rest in the hands \nof my law clerk, Ms. Cecily Holiday. \nThrough her efforts and the change in philosophy as to the approach to this particular case, the size of the \nlitigation has been substantially reduced, however, I have now put myself in the position where I am relying \nheavily on the presence of my law clerk at trial. Ms. Holiday’s examination schedule runs from December 7th \nthrough December 17th. For that reason and that reason alone I am requesting continuance of this matter until \nthe 18th of December. I am prepared to litigate through the Christmas holidays. \n \n4  “The  evidence  presented  on  the  motions  for  supplemental  relief  contains  proof  of  pervasive,  invidious \n  discrimination against Mexican-Americans throughout the State of Texas. The extent of the discrimination is \n  13 \n \n\n \ncomparable in magnitude to the overwhelming evidence of state-supported racial segregation (of black students) \nwhich was found more than ten years ago.” \n506 F.Supp. at 411. \n \n5  They are not sequentially numbered. \n \n \n6  To take a random and minor example, No. 814 states: “The TEA Office of Technical Assistance is staffed by 12 \n  professionals.”  TEA’s  actual  reply  to  its  counsel  was,  “No.  The  Office  of  Technical  Assistance  has  eleven \nprofessionals.” State counsel nevertheless conceded that it had twelve, as originally proposed by plaintiffs. \n \n7  514. Teachers who taught bilingually in violation of the “no Spanish rule” in the Texas state statutes until 1968 \n  risked loss of jobs and/or revocation of their teaching certificates. \n(TEA response:) No. \n701. Segregation of Mexican American students is a historical fact in the Texas Public Schools. \n(TEA response:) No. \n704. Official publications of the Texas State Department of Education at one time reflected a police of Anglo \nracial domination over Mexican American people, their language and culture. \n(TEA response:) No. The statement provides no basis for reference of specific publications and what those \npublications reflected is a conclusion. \n706. Historically, Texas has failed to effectively educate Mexican American students of limited English \nspeaking ability. \n(TEA response:) No. \n710. The so-called “no Spanish rule” was strictly adhered to and took the form of forbidding Mexican \nAmerican children from speaking their native tongue while in the classroom, school halls, or playground. \n(TEA response:) No. \n711. Violators of the “no Spanish rule” were corporally punished, shamed, threatened, fined, suspended and \nexpelled from school by Texas school administrators. \n(TEA response:) No. \n729. “Mexican schools” in Texas existed in 122 districts in 59 counties in 1942. \n(TEA response:) The Agency has no information to confirm or deny these data. \n735. J. W. Edgar, Commissioner after L. A. Woods, received about 22 complaints from different cities \nrelevant to violations of Delgado. Schools cited were Hondo, Pecos, Kyle, Lockhart, Seguin. State Education \nauthorities cooperated to allow local districts to systematically reject the burden of Delgado. \n  14 \n \n\n \n(TEA response:) No. \n738. Historically, Texas educators have viewed public education as a vehicle for “Americanizing” the “foreign \nelement.” \n(TEA response:) The Agency has no information to confirm or deny these data. \n748.  Mexican  American  children  have  historically  been  provided  inferior  facilities,  often  drastically \nover-crowded, sometimes necessitating 1/2 day classes. \n(TEA response:) The Agency has no information to confirm or deny these data. \n750. Texas sanctioned creation of separate school systems through approval of construction bonds which \nschool board minutes indicate were explicitly designed for the construction or repair of Mexican schools. \n(TEA response:) The Agency has no information to confirm or deny these data. \n \n8  Filed in connection with efforts by the state at a later time to obtain relief from the stipulations, efforts that we \n  discuss later. \n \n9  Reference to that source list shows, for example, that the 11 stipulations quoted at n.7 above were taken from three \n  writings only. Nos. 514, 704, 706, 710, and 711 derive from the 1977 doctoral dissertation of Dr. Ernesto Zamora, “A \nStatus Survey of Texas’ Bilingual-Bicultural Education Programs”; nos. 729, 735, 738, and 748 from Weinberg, “A \nChance to Learn” (Cambridge University Press 19); no. 750 from Project Report: De Jure Segregation of Chicanos in \nTexas Schools, 7 Harv. C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 307 (1972); and no. 701 from the last two sources jointly. \n \n10  Derived from Keyes v. Denver Sch. Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). \n \n \n11  The portion of the letter referred to states: \n \nDear Judge Justice: \nDefendants propose to withdraw the following listed items from the contested issues of fact in the pretrial \norder entered in this matter. If the source of the following listed items, i.e., date and name are given, \nDefendants no longer contest Plaintiff-Intervenor’s proposed facts numbers 1, 3, (etc.). \n \n12  TEA is there advised that it “should be embarassed to file this Motion” which “is founded on demonstrably false \n  justifications.” Elsewhere in the response, the motion is characterized as “a Public Relations gimmick,” as “made in \nbad faith,” as “flatly contradicted by the facts,” etc. We are nonplussed that exchanges between counsel couched in \nsuch terms should remain merely verbal. \n \n13  On August 21, 1981, a panel of this court granted an effective stay of the district court’s order, it having previously \n \n  15 \n \n\n \nbeen temporarily stayed by a single judge on August 19. \n \n14  The affidavit of Mr. Ryan, General Counsel for the Central Education Agency of the State of Texas, states in part as \n  follows: \nI am the General Counsel for the Central Education Agency, State of Texas, and have served in such capacity \nsince September 1, 1979. As part of my duties, I am responsible for coordinating litigation involving the Central \nEducation Agency in the state and federal courts and for acting as liaison between the Agency and the Office of \nthe Attorney General of Texas. \nThe  document  entitled  “STIPULATIONS”  introduced  at  the  opening  of  trial  in  this  matter  as \nPlaintiff-Intervenors’  Exhibit  409,  was  entered  without  my  knowledge  or  consent,  express  or  implied. \nFurthermore, my office was not provided copies of any documents or correspondence withdrawing items from \nthe contested issues of fact. \n(emphasis  added).  That  of  Mr.  Anderson,  Executive  Assistant  to  the  Deputy  Commissioner  for  Program \nAdministration & Finance, stated: \nIn the summer of 1978, Roland Allen, the Assistant Attorney General then assigned to represent the Texas \nEducation Agency in Civil Action No. 5281: U. S. v. Texas (Bilingual), requested that the Agency review a set of \nproposed stipulations submitted by Plaintiffs-Intervenors. The Agency was requested to advise Mr. Allen as to \nthe stipulations with which the Agency could agree and those with which the Agency could not agree. \nThe proposed Findings of Fact as submitted by Plaintiffs-Intervenors were numbered 1-1411. However, the \nproposed stipulations totaled approximately 475, inasmuch as gaps existed in the numbering. I participated \nwith other selected Agency employees in determining which of the proposed facts could be stipulated. A \nresponse  on  behalf  of  the  Agency  was  prepared,  entitled  “Civil  Action  5281/Proposed \nResponses/Plaintiff-Intervenors Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law”, dated August 17, 1978 (a \ncopy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2). This document contains the Agency’s response to each of the \nproposed stipulations and indicates as to each whether the Texas Education Agency agreed, did not agree, or \ndid not have data upon which to base a judgment. The Texas Education Agency agreed to 198 of the proposed \nstipulations of fact, did not agree to 250, and agreed with certain understandings or exceptions contained in 27 \nof the proposed stipulations. A copy of the document attached hereto as Exhibit 1 was provided to Assistant \nAttorneys General, Roland Allen and Bob Giddings. \nDuring the spring and summer of 1979, the proposed stipulations were discussed with the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral then assigned to the litigation, Ms. Susan Dasher. Ms. Dasher was provided with a copy of Exhibit 1. No \nperson  on  the  Agency  staff  responsible  for  evaluating  the  proposed  stipulations  submitted  by \nPlaintiffs-Intervenors agreed, explicitly or implicitly, to stipulate to the accuracy of the proposed findings of fact \nas used by the Court in its Memorandum Opinion. No authorization was granted by the Agency to the Office of \nthe Attorney General to stipulate to any proposed findings of fact submitted by Plaintiffs-Intervenors in a \nmanner inconsistent with responses as contained in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1 constitutes the Agency’s position on the \nproposed stipulations as presented by Plaintiffs-Intervenors. \n(emphasis added). Finally, Ms. Dasher’s affidavit reads, in pertinent part: \nOn October 31, 1979, I wrote a letter to the Court and the parties wherein I agreed to withdraw objections to \ncertain proposed findings and exhibits so long as the source, date and name for those findings were given. I \nmet with plaintiff-intervenors’ attorneys on November 28, 1979, in order to accomplish this goal. \nWhile the plaintiff-intervenors’ proposed findings were reviewed with mid-level Texas Education Agency staff \nwith a view to determining which findings we would offer evidence to rebut, the entering of the stipulations \n  16 \n \n\n \nwas not authorized by the policymaking officials of the Texas Education Agency or my superiors at the Attorney \nGeneral’s Office nor was such authorization sought. \n(emphasis added). \n \n15  “Segregation of Mexican American students is a historical fact in the Texas Public Schools.” \n \n \n16  In this the court was mistaken. Under Texas law the attorney general enjoys an exclusive right to represent state \n  agencies, and if the services of other lawyers are to be had it must be with his permission and “in subordination” to \nhis authority. V.A.T.S. art. 4395; Hill v. Texas Water Quality Board, 568 S.W.2d 738 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1978, writ \nref’d n.r.e.). \n \n17  While the district court rejected the state’s version of the intended effect of the  stipulations as merely to \n  references, it voiced no disagreement with this aspect of the showing made. Texas has been at particular pains to \nattempt to circumscribe the power of the attorney general to make admissions on its behalf. V.A.T.S. art. 4411 \nprovides: “No admission, agreement or waiver, made by the Attorney General, in any action or suit in which the \nState is a party, shall prejudice the rights of the State.” \n \n18  Especially is this so where, as here, the critical portions of the court’s opinion contain explicit references to the \n  stipulations and to nothing else in the record. We think it improper to seek to support the trial court’s judgment by \nreference to other record evidence when this judgment rests on such waivers of proof as the stipulations here \nrepresent. \n \n19  Presumably, since the stipulation was prepared and proposed by appellees-“written” by them, as we were advised \n  at oral argument-something akin to the immemorial pleading presumption applies: that the most extreme claims \nsupportable were advanced. \n \n20  Nor is Dr. Zamora’s dissertation, the source of the stipulation, more specific. The source reference of the stipulation \n  is to a single sentence on page 33 of the dissertation: “Furthermore, it is also a known fact that teachers risked \nlosing their jobs and/or revocation of their teaching certificates if they taught bilingually.” \n \n21  A notion sometimes celebrated elsewhere as “the melting pot.” \n \n \n22  Except in some degree, at its inception, the German language. \n \n \n23  The  state’s  extensive  new  remedial-language  program,  providing  for  both  bilingual  education  and \n  English-as-a-second-language instruction, was signed into law on June 12, 1981. The court’s corresponding plan had \n  17 \n \n\n \nbeen decreed on April 17, 1981. \n \n24  We emphasize, in view of our remand and the differing problems and solutions which may in future be shown to \n  exist in the many and diverse school districts of Texas, that our decision today does not explore the reach and \nmanner of application of s 1703(f) so as to foreclose by implication issues not raised here. Among these are such \nquestions as how broad a power of “de novo” review and revision may be exercised by a district court over language \nbarrier programs, consistent with the rule that Congress cannot invest Article III courts with jurisdiction to “exercise \nfunctions which are essentially legislative or administrative.” Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Brothers Bond & \nMortgage Co., 289 U.S. 266, 275, 53 S.Ct. 627, 632, 77 L.Ed. 1166 (1932); or how legislation deriving its force from \nthe Fourteenth Amendment applies to such situations as that of an adult twelfth grader with no knowledge of \nEnglish who enters Texas from Mexico-or from the U.S.S.R. \n \n25  The court’s response to the state’s mootness argument was that: \n \nDefendants argue that the enactment of S.B. 477 on June 12, 1981, created a new program for addressing the \nlearning difficulties of LEP (limited English-proficiency) students which must be given a chance to work before it \ncan be evaluated as a success or failure. Yet the new statute does not substantially alter the theoretical basis of \nthe defendants’ approach, nor does it significantly increase the resources allocated to carry out that approach. \nLimited ESL (English-as-a-second-language) instruction is still authorized in school districts falling under a \nspecified numerical threshold and in all grades after elementary school. Remedial or compensatory programs \nfor children who fall behind in academic areas while becoming proficient in English are not mandated. The new \nlegislation contains some reform provisions, but it does not establish a new approach. \nWe search in vain, however, for evidentiary support for the court’s conclusion that the new legislation does not \nestablish a new approach. The expert testimony at trial, after all, was directed at the inadequacies of the 1973 \nscheme, not the 1981 Act. The Department of Justice, in fact, argues that the 1981 Act, if supplemented by \nprovisions for students of all ages (and in districts with fewer than 20 per grade) who have not had the full \ncomplement  of  bilingual  education  at  the  elementary  grades,  by  appropriate  provisions  for  individual \nassessments of student proficiency, and by provision for teacher recruitment and training, “comes very close to \nbeing one acceptable way of complying with s 1703(f).” Thus, the Department of Justice urges remand to enforce \nthe order “going back to the baseline of state law.” We need not attempt to resolve the abstract question of the \nadequacy of the 1981 Act under s 1703(f) criteria. We merely note that the question was never even canvassed at \ntrial. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  18 \n ",

State of Texas, et al., C.A. 1424 (Marshall Division) until March 9, 1971, at which \n  time it was transferred to the Tyler Division and styled C.A. 5281. \n \n2  Testimony showed that this distance would increase substantially if measured from the northern rather than the \n  southern half of the St. Paul-Shiloh District. \n \n3  Likewise, the detachment of portions of Buffalo and/or Centerville would not have been consistent with state law \n  absent the approval of the districts involved. \n \n  11 \n \n\n4  See also Conclusion of Law 15 issued in this case, November 24, 1970. \n \n \n5  Some districts known as “budget-balance” districts have a large amount of local available funds and do not qualify to \n  receive state aid for salaries and operations or transportation. \n \n6  Since so-called routes often include several trips or runs, the State must be required to examine the runs rather than \n  only the routes. This complete review would enable the State to determine whether a given route includes \nduplicative runs. \n \n7  The portion is determined by the district’s economic index which reflects the amount of county and local funds \n  available and the amount of state funds needed to allow the district to meet minimum requirements. The average \ndistrict in Texas receives about 80% of its financial support from the State. \n \n8  It should also be noted that if a district is found in noncompliance with Title VI or the Fourteenth Amendment by \n  HEW or by any other agency of the Federal Government, whether executive or judicial, TEA should treat such a \nfinding as conclusive, provided such a finding has been adopted as final agency action by the appropriate executive \nagency or is not on appeal or eligible for appeal in a judicial proceeding. \n \n9  Such a requirement finds support in the testimony of Mr. Leon Graham, Assistant Commissioner for Administration, \n  Texas Education Agency, on February 1, 1971. Mr. Graham recognized the educational handicap created by an \ninadequate knowledge of English and indicated that the State Board of Education has taken “a very strong stand on \nbilingual education.” (Tr. 71, February 1, 1971) \n \n10  The TEA plan states that “all vocational education student state associations sponsored by TEA *** have been \n  completely desegregated” since 1965. (Plan, p. 6, emphasis added) The Court is concerned primarily with assuring \nequal opportunities for all students participating in these programs. \n \n11  Activities under Title I could include, for example, remedial programs in which children could participate in special \n  classes run on a bi-racial basis, or field trips on which students from inner-city, racially isolated schools would be \njoined by children from other areas of the city. \n \n12  Title II funds might be  used to provide library materials of special cultural interest to children of minority \n  background. Title III  funds  could  be  used  to  establish centers  where  children  throughout  the  district  could \nparticipate together on special projects, remedial activities or extracurricular programs. \n \n13  For example, under ESEA, Title VII-20 U.S.C. 880b-Bilingual Education, school districts may receive funds to provide \n  classes in Spanish for minority children to assist them in getting an equal education before they are able to use \n  12 \n \n\nEnglish well enough to compete with their Anglo classmates. Classes may also be conducted in both Spanish and \nEnglish so that ethnically integrated classrooms may be made possible. Under 20 U.S.C. 241c(a) (6), 241e(c)-Aid to \nChildren of Migratory Workers-districts may receive Federal aid to assist in the instruction of children migrants, \nmost of whom are Mexican-American and most of whom are deficient in English. \n \n14  Presently within TEA is the Division of Program Development which is to provide state-wide leadership for \n  stimulation, initiation planning and coordination or curriculum improvement programs. \n \n15  Racially or ethnically isolated classes may be a result of an educationally neutral assignment policy, particularly in \n  school districts with high minority ratios or in urban areas with racially or ethnically isolated communities. When \nsuch instances come to the attention of TEA, however, they should be investigated carefully to determine whether a \nvalid educational justification for the isolation exists or whether the justification offered is merely a subterfuge to \nconceal discriminatory student assignments. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n ",

These districts were included \nbecause of their roles with reference to the creation and support of several of the all-black districts. Further, the \ncounty boards of education for the counties in which all independent districts lie are proper parties because of their \nparticipation in certain land transfers affecting the boundary lines and the racial composition of the enrollment of \nthe independent districts. \n \n**  CSD \n \n \n4  Art. 7, § 7 of the Texas Constitution provides,‘Separate schools shall be provided for the white and colored children, \n \n  16 \n \n\n \nand impartial provision shall be made for both.’ \n \n5  These circumstances may have been reinforced by the presence on the State statute books of a law under which no \n  school authority could abolish a dual school system or abolish arrangements to allow minority students to transfer \nout of a district without a vote of the qualified electors living in the district. (Section 2900a, Vernon’s Civil Statutes). \nSubsection 4 of the Statute provided that a district violating the above provision would be ineligible for accreditation \nand ineligible for State financial assistance under the Minimum Foundation Program. Finally, in addition to the \nsanctions against the district, the Statute provided that any person violating the provisions would be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and subject to a fine of $100 to $1000. \nThis statute was declared unconstitutional in Boson v. Rippy, 285 F.2d 43 (5 Cir. 1960). Op.Att’y General, 1962. \nN.WW-1490. \n \n6  In 1948, the State of Texas included some 5,000 school districts. That number has now been reduced to under \n  1,200. \n \n7  The two independent all-black districts, Butler ISD and Cason ISD, each have a total enrollment of approximately 240 \n  black students. St. Paul CSD has a total enrollment of about 200. \n \n8  The St. Paul CSD is somewhat unique in that it has been operated in conjunction with a private charitable \n  organization which has donated several excellent buildings for the use of the school. The district in turn has \neducated children living on the campus in dormitories financed by the charitable organization. All but three of its \nstudents are black and are so-called ‘problem’ children from northern and eastern Texas. The remaining three are \nMexican-American. \n \n9  See Government’s Exhibits: 11, 21, 51, 31, 51, 61, 71, 81 and 91. \n \n \n10  E.g. During the 1969-70 school year, approximately 21 black students transferred from Sherman Independent School \n  District, whose enrollment included both white and black students, to attend school in Whiterock Common School \nDistrict, which was all-black. \n \n11  During the 1969-70 school year, e.g., approximately 12 white students transferred from St. Paul CSD to Malakoff \n  ISD. \n \n12  During the 1969-70 school year, all students living in the Jeddo CSD and wishing to attend high school transferred to \n  Smithville ISD, because the Jeddo district offered only grades 1-8. \n \n  17 \n \n\n \n13  Minimum Foundation Program assistance from the State is normally based upon the prior year’s average daily \n  attendance (ADA) in the district. Therefore, the impact of student transfers is to increase the receiving district’s ADA \nand, thereby, to increase the base upon which that district’s State assistance is computed. \n \n14  Any district whose ADA falls below 15 is required to operate without the benefit of State funds except in cases of \n  severe hardship. Texas Education Code § 16.13 (1969). \n \n15  The 1948 study of Education in North Carolina, 397-401, conducted by the State Education Commission, contains \n  the following pertinent recommendations: \n‘Since a local administrative unit should be sufficiently large enough to warrant the provision of all essential \nadministrative and supervisory services, local units of school administration which are established in the future \nshould be organized so as to assure the unit an absolute minimum of 3,500 to 4,000 school population and desirable \nminimum of 9,000 to 10,000 school population.’ \nThe 1968 Report of the Governor’s Study Commission on the Public School System of North Carolina, 29, 167, states: \n‘(T)he movement has been toward the consolidation of smaller schools and a trend toward the establishment of \nlarge administrative units. \n‘So that North Carolina can provide economical and effective schools, the Commission recommends that the State \nadopt the county as the basic school administrative unit. Merger of city units with county units and, where \nnecessary, merger across county lines should be accomplished, in order to achieve sound educational programs.’ \nSee similar language from Volume IV of the Report of the Governor’s Committee on Public School Education in \nTexas, which states, at page 13: \n‘To offer a comprehensive program, a school district must either be large enough to have classes of reasonable size \nin a variety of subjects, or it must operate with very small classes at a very high cost per student. As adopted, the \nthe Texas Minimum Foundation Program underwrites an unhappy compromise between these two alternatives. \nSmall districts are granted more favorable personnel ratios and higher operating allotments but they still have \nnarrow programs. The Gilmer-Aiken Committee estimated that reorganization would save $10 million a year in 1949 \nunder the Foundation Program. The saving would be more than twice that amount now.’ \nThat particular section of the Committee Report concludes with the following observations: \n‘The Governor’s Committee recognized that the local high school may be the mainstay of some small communities, \nbut it has concluded that no child should be deprived of educational opportunities fitted to his needs. The \nestablishment of strong local units which are competent to provide comprehensive programs is the best guarantee \nof continued local control of educational policy. The Committee also is convinced that no district shall be allowed to \noffer inferior educational opportunities to children who will soon be citizens of a distant city.’ \n \n16  Mr. Gilbert Conoley, Program Director for the Title IV Technical Assistance Program, TEA, during his deposition \n  dated August 19, 1970, stated that the freedom of choice transfer policy between schools within a particular school \ndistrict was similar to the free transfer policy between school districts. (See pages 54-63). With reference to the \ntransfer of white students out of the Jackson Common School District which resulted in maintaining Jackson as an \nall-black district, and with reference to the resulting impact of these transfers on Jackson’s compliance status with \nrespect to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Mr. Conoley stated: ‘In my opinion, it (the transfer arrangement) was nothing \n  18 \n \n\n \nmore than defiance of ever coming in compliance.’ (Page 57.) \n \n17  TEA Statement of Compliance (Government Exhibit 100B) and United States by Clark v. Frazer, 297 F.Supp. 319 \n  (M.D.Ala.1968). \n \n18  In United States v. Tatum Independent School District, 306 F.Supp. 285, 288 (E.D.Tex.1969), this Court made the \n  following Conclusions of Law: \n‘2. The United States is authorized to bring this action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its \nimplementing regulations, 45 C.F.R. 80.8(a) (1969 rev.). \n‘3. Apart from specific statutory authorization, the United States has standing to enforce the terms and conditions \nupon which its money allotments are made. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); \nUnited States by Clark v. Frazer, 297 F.Supp. 319 (M.D.Ala.1968). \n‘4. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 imposes on school districts an obligation to insure the guarantee of the \nFourteenth Amendment as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Green v. County School Board, etc., 391 U.S. 430, 88 \nS.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968) and its companion cases Raney v.

For example, segregation of Mexican-American students in the San Felipe and Del Rio Independent \nSchool Districts, in violation of the court’s order, was alleged in 1971. Unconstitutional discrimination was found and \nrelief  was  ordered.  United  States  v.  Texas,  342  F.Supp.  24  (E.D.Tex.1971)  (San  Felipe  Del  Rio  Consolidated \nIndependent School District ). In another suit spawned by the original 1971 court order, intentional, statewide \ndiscrimination against Mexican-American students was found to be practiced by TEA. United States v. Texas, 498 \nF.Supp. 1356 (E.D.Tex.1980) (Gregory-Portland Independent School District Intervention ). The Gregory-Portland \ndecision, discussed in greater detail below, touched upon many of the same issues involved in the instant action. \n \n2  The term “Anglo” shall be used throughout this memorandum opinion in referring to caucasians, i. e., those persons \n  who are neither Mexican-American nor Black nor members of any other racial or ethnic minority which is generally \nidentified as “non-White”. \n \n3  Some 456 stipulations of fact, agreed to by all parties, were set forth in a single document entitled “STIPULATIONS” \n  and introduced at the opening of trial as Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Exhibit 409. References to specific stipulations \ncontained within this exhibit will be abbreviated as “Pl.-Int. Ex. 409, # —-” throughout this opinion. \n \n4  Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Keyes, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had held that proof of \n  discriminatory impact was sufficient to make out a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. E. g., Cisneros v. Corpus \nChristi Independent School District, 467 F.2d 142 (1972) (en banc). Thus, the issue of intent was not raised when this \ncourt rendered its initial decision in United States v. Texas in 1971. \n  27 \n \n\n \n5  This is not a case, like Dayton I, where the incremental impact of isolated instances of discrimination can be \n  quantified and specifically ascertained. Here, the proven violation is systemwide in its scope and impact. Moreover, \ngeneralized learning impairment, in contrast to statistically-imbalanced student populations, does not lend itself to \nsuch an analysis. In the former case, it is enough to identify a specific cause of present injury, produced by \ndefendants’ unconstitutional actions, and to devise a remedy which will eliminate that cause of harm. Such an \napproach is qualitative rather than quantitative in nature, but it fully satisfies the fundamental requirement that the \nscope of relief be determined by the scope of the violation and its resulting harm. Swann, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at \n1276. \n \n6  The Texas Bilingual Education Act was not limited in scope to Mexican-American children. The statute encompassed \n  all students with a native language other than English with learning difficulties. Yet the record indicates that more \nthan ninety-five percent of all Texas schoolchildren with limited English-speaking ability are of Mexican-American \nancestry, with Spanish as their dominant language. Throughout the remainder of this opinion, the attributes and \neffectiveness of the state’s educational programs shall be assessed exclusively as they pertain to this class of \nMexican-Americans,  which  has  been  victimized  by  the historical  discrimination  described  above.  Aside  from \nMexican-Americans, the legal sufficiency of the defendants’ educational programs which involve students who \nspeak other languages than English is beyond the scope of this litigation and will not be addressed in this opinion. \n \n7  The terms “bilingual education” and “bilingual-bicultural education” will be used interchangeably throughout this \n  opinion. As evidenced by the definition found in the “Bilingual Education Act”, quoted above, appreciation for the \nforeign language student’s cultural heritage is an inherent part of any comprehensive bilingual program. The parties \nhave stipulated that “(t)he incorporation of the history and culture associated with a student’s dominant language \ninto the instructional process is an integral part of bilingual-bicultural education.” Pl.-Int. Ex. 409, # 1116. \n \n8  An alternative approach, described by Vidal Trevino, Superintendent of the Laredo Independent School District, as \n  the “cold turkey method”, Def. Ex. 95 at 7, involves placing a foreign language student without proficiency in English \ninto a regular English language class, absent special instruction of any kind. None of the testimony at trial indicated \nthat this was a productive or effective educational method. Indeed, the parties stipulated that to expect such \nchildren to achieve success in our educational system without making special provision for their language difficulties \nis an illusion. Pl.-Int. Ex. 409, # 1119. \n \n9  The Commission noted in its report that in the absence of past discrimination or negative socioeconomic conditions, \n  foreign  language  children  could  often  achieve  academic  success  without  bilingual  instruction.  Id.  at  69-74. \nConversely, where widespread discrimination has occurred, as is the case with respect to Mexican-Americans in \nTexas, bilingual instruction serves to remove the sense of inferiority and other learning barriers established by that \ndiscrimination and restores equal educational opportunity. Id. at 137-141. \n \n10  The state statute uses the phrase “limited English-speaking ability” to describe those eligible for bilingual education, \n  while the federal Bilingual Education Act employs the term “limited English proficiency”. The state itself recognizes \nthat the purpose of bilingual education is to further a child’s overall ability to learn in an English-language classroom, \nnot merely  to  improve  oral  speech. Limited  English  “proficiency”,  which  encompasses  reading,  writing,  and \nunderstanding the language, in addition to speech, is the more precise term and will be used in lieu of the phrase \n  28 \n \n\n“limited English speaking ability” throughout the remainder of this opinion. \n \n11  The significance of percentile scores on standardized tests obviously depends upon the test population to which a \n  particular student is being compared. The approved tests specified by the TEA as exit criteria are national in scope of \nadministration.  Documentary  evidence  indicates  that  the  threshold  percentile  scores  adopted  referred  to  a \nstatistical comparison with all students taking the test throughout the United States. Alternatively, the TEA could \nhave employed a relative scale based upon scores achieved by students in Texas or by Anglo students nationwide or \nby any other particular subset of the overall national student population. Such a change in the base population \nwould necessarily alter the significance of a particular percentile score. \n \n12  Plaintiffs do not assert an independent constitutional right to intelligible instruction outside the context of past de \n  jure  discrimination.  Such  a  claim  would  necessarily  require  a  confrontation  with  the  crucial  question  left \nunanswered by the Supreme Court in San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d \n16 (1973). In Rodriguez, the Court held that mere discrepancies in the amount of funding provided for public \neducation did not infringe upon any fundamental constitutional right. Id. at 36-37, 93 S.Ct. at 1298-1299. But the \nCourt left open the possibility that an absolute denial of educational opportunity could constitute, in itself, a denial \nof equal protection subject to strict scrutiny. Id. See also Doe v. Plyler, 628 F.2d 448, 456-57 (5th Cir. 1980); \nFialkowski  v.  Shapp,  405  F.Supp.  946,  958  (E.D.Pa.1975)  (holding  absolute  deprivation  of  education \nunconstitutional).  Moreover,  even  in  the  wake  of  Rodriguez,  a  minimum  quantum  of  education  may  be \nconstitutionally protected as a necessary prerequisite to the exercise of other constitutional rights. \nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), discussed below, the Supreme Court observed that \nstudents who do not understand English and are placed in all-English classrooms “are certain to find their classroom \nexperiences wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.” Id. at 566, 94 S.Ct. at 788 (emphasis added). Such \nstudents, the Court found, “are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus it \ncould be argued that the defendants’ failure to provide appropriate remedial instruction to Spanish-speaking \nchildren constitutes, in effect, an absolute deprivation of education, impinging upon a fundamental right and \ntriggering strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In light of the parties’ \nfailure to raise this claim, and also giving consideration to the disposition of the remainder of the case, no effort will \nbe made to decide this important question or to address it in greater detail. \n \n13  The text of the statute is as follows: \n \nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance. \n \n14  This conclusion is not affected by Serna v. Portales Municipal Schools, 499 F.2d 1147 (10th Cir. 1974), Lora v. Board \n  of Education of the City of New York, 456 F.Supp. 1211 (E.D.N.Y.1978), or any other Title VI cases decided prior to \nthe Court’s decision in Bakke. \n \n15  Long before Milliken, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had required remedial education programs as an \n  element of equitable relief in the desegregation context to help students overcome past inadequacies in their \neducational opportunities. United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Ed., 372 F.2d 836, 900 (1966), cert. denied 389 \n  29 \n \n\nU.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 67, 19 L.Ed.2d 103 (1967). See also United States v. Texas, 342 F.Supp. 24 (E.D.Tex.1971), aff’d 466 \nF.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam ). These cases and others have recognized that the legacy of discrimination \nendures long after the schools have been desegregated, unless special remedial measures are undertaken to \ncompensate for past inequities. \nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has also addressed the use of compensatory education programs to cure \nlearning disabilities resulting in whole or in part from unlawful discrimination. Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d 750, \n767-69 (1978) (en banc ), aff’d. 446 U.S. 923, 100 S.Ct. 1862, 64 L.Ed.2d 278 (1980). Relying primarily upon Milliken, \nthe court carefully reviewed and approved a wide variety of programs, including teacher training, curriculum \ndevelopment,  remedial  reading  instruction,  and  student  counseling,  to  eliminate  the  vestiges  of  de  jure \ndiscrimination in the suburbs of Wilmington, Delaware. Id. at 769-74. \n \n16  It should also be noted that one major reason for the present shortage of bilingual teachers is the defendants’ \n  discriminatory failure to hire Mexican-American faculty members in the past. Many school districts with large \nnumbers of Mexican-American students refused until recently to hire any teachers with that ethnic background. For \nexample,  in  1969,  the  Sonora  Independent  School  District  had  a  Mexican-American  majority  in  its  student \npopulation, but employed no Mexican-American faculty members. Gov.Ex. C-219 at 33-34. Similarly, in 1971, the \nstudent body of La Feria Independent School District was 78.1 percent Mexican-American, but only 6.9 percent of \nthe district’s teachers shared that ethnic heritage. Gov. Ex. C-11a at 15. \n \n17  The Secretary of Education recently promulgated proposed regulations regarding special educational programs for \n  students of limited English language proficiency to replace the “Lau Remedies”. But Congress has enacted legislation \nprohibiting the expenditure of funds for the adoption or enforcement of any such final regulations prior to June 1, \n1981. H.J.Res. 644, s 117 (96th Cong., 2nd Sess.). \n \n18  The purpose of the aforementioned measures is to ensure that the expansion of bilingual instruction does not serve \n  to  exacerbate  existing  segregation  of  students  on  ethnic  grounds.  It  would  be  both  inappropriate  and \ncounterproductive to separate  students by ethnic background as a means of remedying past discrimination. \nSeparation in the bilingual classes themselves is unavoidable, except to the extent that Anglo students may \nvolunteer to participate in such classes for their own educational enrichment. But it is imperative that students be \nintegrated, irrespective of national origin, throughout the school day, other than when bilingual instruction is in \nprogress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  30 \n ",

VII, Section 7, states: \n \n“Separate schools shall be provided for the white and colored children, and impartial provision shall be made for \nboth.” \n \n2  Hernandez  was  a  jury  selection  case  originating  in  Jackson  County,  Texas,  which  is  approximately  15% \n  Mexican-American and which has on the tax rolls freeholders, about six or seven percent of whom were of Mexican \ndescent. The State stipulated that no Mexican- or Latin-named person had served on a jury commission, or a grand \nor petit jury in Jackson County for the twenty-five years immediately preceding the action. It was in this context that \nthe Court found sufficient support for its explanation of classes covered by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n4  See Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33 [36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131]; Takahashi v. Fish & Game Commission, 334 U.S. 410 [68 \n  S.Ct. 1138, 92 L.Ed. 1478]; Cf. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 [63 S.Ct. 1375, 1385, 87 L.Ed. 1774]: \n“Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people \n  12 \n \n\n \nwhose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.” \n \n6  In Juarez v. State, 102 Tex.Cr.R. 297, 277 S.W. 1091, the Texas court held that the systematic exclusion of Roman \n  Catholics from juries was barred by the Fourteenth Amendment. In Clifton v. Puente [Tex.Civ.App.] 218 S.W.2d 272, \nthe Texas court ruled that restrictive covenants prohibiting the sale of land to persons of Mexican descent were \nunenforceable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n ",

NORMAN:\nMay it please the Court, and I'm honored to ap-\nn pear once again before this distinguished Court, represent-\nthe United States in a case which presents, we think,\n12\ndifficult and novel issues.\n13\nThere are two rather distinct issues in our view:\n1.1\nfirst is whether the District Court erred in finding that\n15\nwe had not proved any discrimination In any manner against\nMexican-American students in Austin; and, second, hcthor\nthe District Court erred in approving the Austin School\nEcard plan for desegregation.\nSince those two questions are fairly dio:inct,\nI uld beg leave of the Court to ask Mr. Landsberg at this\ntL to address himself to the question of discrimnation.\nTilE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nVery well, Mr. Lardsbere.\n',\t\n1\n4\n\nMay it please the Court:\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n2(cid:9)\nAre you going to deal with\t question of\n3\t\ndiscrimination against Mexican- Americans?\n4(cid:9)\nMR. LANDSBERG:\n5(cid:9)\nYes, your Honor, and I think that the question\n6\t\n7\t in this case on that issue boils down to whether the\n3\t District Court applied a ;roper standard in deciding\nwhether Mexican-American segregation was the result of\n9\t\nofficial discrimination.\n10(cid:9)\nn\t The standard that was applied by the District\nCourt is not clear. We think that the Court may have been\n12\t\nreferring to and requiring proof of an overt policy of\ndiscrimination against Mexican-Americans.\nlie think that the proper standard is to require\n15\t\n• proof that the school district knowingly assigned students\n16  \nin a manner which the school system could foresee would\nsegregate the children. It chose construction sites, and\ndrew zone lines in such a manner that the natural and\n£oieable consequence was segregation, in s pite of th\nfact that the selection of other sites would have produced\na d;a;rcgaLed school.\nThe District Court's most e::plicit at:ct ell' ant c'\ntc sLandrd that it was applying is fourd onrage three o\n•..\n\nMexican-Americans, but to black students.\nThe Court says, ...the Government has made no\n3 showing that in the period from 1955 tr, the present the\n4 AISD has intentionally perpetuated segregation of blacks. n\n5 The record instead indicates that during this period the\n6 school administration's official acts have not been moti-\n7 vated by any discriminatory purposes.\"\n8 That finding was made in spite of the fact that.\n9 after 1955 the defendants opened four schools not only with\n10 all black student body, but also with all black faculties\n11 assigned to them.\n12 One of those schools, the St. John School was\n13 built in an area which on all four sides was almost entire-\n14 ly white, Anglo.\n15 When that new St. John School opened in 1953,\n16 the Board drew its zone line for the school. It was a\n17 square. The zone line of the adjoining school was in the\nit\n18 form of a closed fist with a thumb sticking up next to the\n19 St. John zone. That thumb was an Anglo residential area.\n2) With respect to the M2xican-Americans the Court\nis not so explicit in requiring a showing of purposefully\n21\nharming children on account of race.\n0\nTIE, COURT: (Judge Coleman)\nIs it o!1-- contention t:h. t: the L, C\t or\n74\n\nwhite race?\n\t\n2 M. LAHDSBERG:\n\t\n3 Your Honor, they are of a different ethnic back-\n\t\n4 ground, and the District Court  held that they were a\n\t separate, identifiable group, minority group, in Austin,\n5\n\t\n6 based not only on prior Court decisions of this Court, and\n\t\n7 the Supreme Court, but based also on the evidence that\n\t\n3 Mexicans had been considered by the community and by the\n\t\n9 school system as constituting a separate minority group.\n\t\n10 THE GOUiT: (Judge Coleman)\n\t\n11 What Itm getting at i5 not what somebody con-\n\t\n12 siders, but what the actual fact and-the constitution re-\n\t\n13 quires. It seems to me, to come right dour to  the point,\n()\n\t\n14 that Mexican-American people are certainly not black. It\n\t\n15 seems that they have always been considered to be whit-_\n- \t \t ---\n16 people, and as\t far aas I knorw Ma_t is ine corrcct coiia'\n17 tion.\n18\t . Now, are we going to set up a new standard by\n19 which we do not go on race, but we go on ethnic background?\n20 THE COURT: (Judge Uidom)\n21 You had that in, of course, Ilernsndez a;aic\nTexas, which answers that question.\n22\nflR. LAiTi)SBG:\nI don't belie- je it is a ne7 stdr4.\n7\n\nThat was in 1.954.\nTHE. COURT: (Judge Coler:ian)\n2(cid:9)\n3\t I'm trying to get from your argument(cid:9) well,\nI didn't hear your answer.\nA\t\nI(cid:9) MR.\n6\t I don't believe it is a new standard, and I be-\n7\t lieve, as Judge Wisdom says, that in the 'Hernandez case,\n3\t on the record in the Hernandez case the Supreme Court\n9\t recognized that if you have an ailuhite jury, which is an\n10  all Anglo jury that there may brave been discrimination\n1 \nagainst Mexican-Americans as an ethnic group.\nThE CI3T: (Judge Colanan)\n12(cid:9)\n13\t You thbk that trying people in Court for a\nU\n14\t criiinci offense is the same as educating them in the\n15(cid:9) schoolhouse?\nMR. LAITDSBERG:\n16(cid:9)\n17\t I think that the analysis of whether the Mexican-\nAr:iericans constitute a separate group would be the same\n19\t for both purposes, where in both cases we're talicing ebout\nthe apolication of the equal o1ction Clause.\nclause o.OeS nut ucitcai1y mention race. I mLht a ,so\npoint, out that the Civil ihs Act rcfos not only to\nrace, hut al3 to na;ioui or\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nrace alone is not it, and your position is that various\nand sundry ethnic groups may be considered in the ontext\n2\t\nof this problem. For example, Polish people could be con-\n3\t\nsidered separate and apart from the Irish, and so forth.\n4\t\n'llL LANDS3RG:\n5(cid:9)\nIf the record were to substantiate the distinction\n6\t\nyes.\n7(cid:9)\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n3(cid:9)\n9\t That brings up this question: In addition to\n10 11 the Hernandez against Texas and other cases recognizing\n11\t Nexican-Americens as a separate ethnic group which may be\ndiscriminated against as a group, what does the record\n12\t\nshow with respect to discrimination in Austin?\n13\t\n  I.M. LANE SBERG:\n14 \t\n15\t Disriiination apc.rt from the school system?\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n16(cid:9)\nNo, in the school system.\n17\t\n18(cid:9) MDR. LANDSLERG:\t -\n19(cid:9) Against i1exicanAr.ricans?\n$\nTiLE COURT: (Judge; ;ii3dom)\n20(cid:9)\nWithin tI\t ciool system, yes.\nWell, I anted to address that by discussing\n---l- \n*'\nie'ou(cid:9) .\n9\n\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nThat is all right.\n2(cid:9)\nMR. LANDSBEG:\n3\nAnd the Court makes findings on pages two and\n4\nthree which are very general in nature, and in footnote\n5\neleven and twelve, in-essence, the finding that the Austin\n6\nIndependent School District has never adopted, published\n7\n8 or promulgated any written or unwi4tten rules, regulations\nor policies having as the purpose o discriminate against\n9\nor segregate or the isolation of -Mexican-Americans. And\n10\nthat the Austin Independent School District has never\n11\ndiscriminated axciinst, or attempted to discriminate against,\n12\nisolate, or segregate iioxican-Amricans in any form whatso-\n13\never.\n14\nAnd then t.--e Court says, particularly in an\n15\nanalysis of various aspects of school operation, such as\n16\nsite locations, school construction, and that finding was\n17\nmade in spite of another finding that at least two Mexican-\n18\nAmerican schools had du.ul overlapping zones with Anglo\n19\npreo:iivant1y  schools, and that tise --'tools\n20 SChOOlS,  !flgiO \nwere referred to as a:;ica-AmerLcan schools, and that\n21\nthey were nlays Mexican-PtTierican schools.\n2(cid:9)\nThe testiony,\t to which the Court\t kes one\np\t sin1 ;sss ;hst in-Aricns w:re\nI\n\nduring the period before 1955.\t They were expected to go\n2\t to the Zavala School, if they 1iicd i the Zavala-Metz\n3(cid:9) area.

Alfred.\n4 Judge Allred was at that time Judge for the\n5 Southern District of Texas. The State of Texas has long\nbeen aware that by the operation of its school system, that\n7 it could effectively discriminate against the Mexican\n3 Americans in violation of Mexican-Americans' constitutional\n9 rights.\n10 As a result of thisdecision, there was great\n11 scrutiny by the school system in Texas. *There was a great\n12 deal of academic or scholarly interest in our schools as\n13 to how we were handling the Mexican-American problem. ETerc\n14 we doing our best to educate those children in a non-\n15 discriminatory fashion?\n16 Fortunately for Austin, I believe, A great number\n17 of candidates for advance degrees dt the University of\n18 Texas wrote their theses and their dissertations on the\n19 study of this issue.\nind in each instance, Dr. Sanchez, who appeacd\n20\nalready as a w5tness in this case,  on the de;rees\n21 W,115 \ncori.t;ce\t Jnd in depth studies were done. Wat tho;\n22\nstudies iich are in evidcrce clearly indated by e1Eaed\nL(cid:9) £ L U(cid:9) tJ.)L1J\n\n(cid:9) of Texas.\n1\n(cid:9) But, in each instance, Austin was pointed to with\n2\n(cid:9) pride as being a school system which hd sincerely and\n3\n(cid:9) honestly strove to offer the best possible education to\n4\n(cid:9) meet the special needs of those children.\n5\n(cid:9) It is clearly developed that the Mexican-American\n6\n(cid:9) in Austin was a displaced person. He had originally been\n7\n(cid:9) along the Rio Grande River. He had been displaced by the,\n8\n(cid:9)\n9 intrusion of wetback labor, by Brazeros, and he came to\n(cid:9) Austin with agricultural skills. And Austin is not a great\n10\n11(cid:9) agricultural community-\nSo, when he arrived there he found that his main\n12\t\nmeans of livelihood was to follow the migratory labor\n13\t\npattern, which is still a problem but far less a problem\n14 11 \nfor these people than it was before.\n15\t\n1 would say that up until World War II, and the\n16\t\nrecords so indicate, the Ixican-Amnrican was primarily an\n17\t\nagricultural worker. And, if you lived in Austin, there\n18\t\n1 was no place for him to ply his talents on a regular basis,\n19 \nAncL the noral pattern of those children was to be taen\n20\t\nof a school in early April, mid-April at the latest,\nOUt \n21\t\nand to f1thz the harvest over the nation, and to return cc\n22\t\nU seho1 y3tem around the 3.5th of Noveniber, reaching its\n--':\t LT\nJrLcn\t p}r cc\n25(cid:9) .(cid:9) _\n\nWorld Jar Ii, was found in the Austin school system.\n2\nNow, this generated two problems.\t It was not a\n3 problem of the child; it was a problet* of the child's\n0\nopportunity.\t He was permitted to attend school half a day -\n5 not half a day, but half a session.\t He had no real \nOp-\n6 portunity to keep up with the nre advantaged children who\n7 attended school on a full time basis.\nh\nSo, the natural and normal, inescapable result of\nthat was siraply that they did not reach grade level, that\n10 you had children twelve, thirteen and fourteen years old\nin the first grade, with six and seven year old children.\n12 Now, where the only evidence in this record of any\ndiscrimination by the Austin school district are excerpts\n14 from minutes in which there are references to some sehoola\n13\nas being 'iexican schools,\" and we would readily admit it\n1\nat this moment that they were really\t exicanschools, that\n17 they were designed to meet the needs, the special ncds of\n18 the Me.icari-American child, where he would or could go to\n19\nget an ordinary type of education, ha didn't complete high\n20\nschool\t he was too far bchind.\t So w'a\t have, and\n21\npointed to, and this is disturbing if you're proud of a\n2 system, rhat we have ws at all tims in the tocal hi:ory\n2 of the Austin school districs from its tgLiiL:g\t I 1iLl\n21 the e1iest rrcord we could ftd -\t n\niS.S\t :.S\t ................\t S\t 55\n.S* 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1(cid:9) child being denied access to any school.\n(cid:9)\n2 And every student, every school in the City of\n(cid:9)\n3 Austin and all of the students have cotsfstently, through\n(cid:9)\n4 the years, had a Mexican-American component. So we're\n(cid:9)\n5 pointed to as being discriminatory because two things oc-\n(cid:9)\n6 curred:\n(cid:9)\n7 First,\t say that in Austin originally, the\n(cid:9)\n3 good part of Austin, the wealthy part of Austin, the silk\n(cid:9)\n9 stocking district in Austin -- all the Tenth Ward -- was\n(cid:9)\n10 once down in the Zavala area that we are talking about\n(cid:9)\n11 now, and has converted to a largely Mexican-American popula-j\n(cid:9)\n12 tion. In that area we had the Palm School, and we had\n(cid:9)\n13 Metz, and all of these schools had a substantial xican-\n(cid:9)\n14 American coonent at all times.\n(cid:9)\n15 Now, on account of the problem of the children\n16 who came late, and who were over age in grade, our school\n17 system decided that there should be a sp:cial school to\n18 which voluntary access was accorded.

Ile taught\n15 industrial ar which was not taught in any other. We\n16 taught homemaking in that school, where we didn't have that\n17 in any other school, and we did this in order to meet the\n18 social needs of these Mcmican-Amer leans, these  children.\n19 As reflected by these records, we put: in the first\n20 visiting teacher prograra Jad the visiting teacher pro-\nII\ngram was really a Social worker, •and he was paid the trurit\n21\nofficer 2 s salary, a gcndciiisn fr_o'Hm:om the Truant Office, nd\n22\ncie called hii a viciting teacher; and we put c social\n23\nworker t;ere to rf o ini:e(cid:9) -h\nLy(cid:9) Cc\n.1\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nschool, and to try to get their parents to participate in\nschool activities.\n2(cid:9)\nis \n3\t This  the kind of school system that Austin has\nrun, and throughout the time we were meeting those special\n5\t education needs and we have continued to try to do it by\nthe curriculum, bilingual programs then, and during the\n6\ntime ie were trying to do this.

The Court has ruled that black schools can be\n(cid:9) c1oc.d to effect desegretion if the plants are physically\n22\n(cid:9)\n23 inadRJate, if the sites arc in equate and if the ir.; act\nof these ti .ngs proved in this c;c\n23(cid:9) one \n7!,.\n\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n1(cid:9)\n2\t We have also gaid that if the closinZof school\n3\t imposes a burden on the blacks not imposed upon whites,\t\n0\n4(cid:9) that that is improper.(cid:9) -.\n5 MISS DREii:\n6 Yes, your Honor.\n7 And this Court has also ruled that it is improper\n8 where it is done for reasons of avoiding white f light\n9 And I think that there is ample testimony in the record\n10 that that is why the black schools were . closed in these\n11 cases, because they felt that the white studepts uould not\n12 attend formerly black schools.\n13 There are several schools which are smaller and\nmore adequate from every standpoint than the schools closed\n14\nin this instance. And we ask the Court to require those\n15\nschools to be reopened and used within the system with the\n16\n17 other school,-,\n18 . The other point that I would raise is that the\nCourt fId. tat the irltarv3norc, Loth b1:. nrid \t icn-\n19\nAcericar, ask the Court to find that the discrimination,\n20\nincident3 of disc:imination in this systeLi, are sufficiett\n21\ntern or cyst\t -L.?a discrimirti\n-(cid:9) 22 to(cid:9) t:1-3.h i r: \ncn -2xic\t !icans at tc ::eit\n23(cid:9) ai:C L.0(cid:9)\nhasis.\n25(cid:9)\n/3\n\nI\t We don't think it is necebsary to remand for\nfurther hearing for a finding of discrimination against\neither group. The record is clear, we feel, with the in-\n4 of segregation of both groups.\n\t\nI\t We might also point out that it is discriminatory\n6\t against blacks to establish a secondary plan as has been\n7 done here ) which does not include desegregation of the\ni Meiean -Amer ican students.\n2(cid:9) Blacks have a right, under the desegregation pro- \nI\n10\t cess, to be integrated in the whole system with all of the\nstudents in the system. If that happens to include a\n12 Mexican-Any_rican or some Chinese children, or any other\nminority, those children should be included in the plan.\n14 I think that there is no possible way of working\nat a desegre;ation plan that does not include all \ngroups,\n16\t without discrirainating unconstitionally against the black\n17 children.\n18 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n19 You take the position that the record i clear\n20 that there was system-wide discrimin ation against blacks?\n21 NISS DREW:\n1gainst blacks and\ndiscrimintiori\nAnd\t cLfrericans, too?\n7$\n\n\t\n..o:.,..:4_•.4..,s`..,,a.e.rax!^a..,.e.w•.c'::sa,.::..,.,-.........-N:::.A:Cr nw:«.:,_, ,ex..r ._,..•.w.A:., .,,.,.x'w :c^:...u::.1::.a:aw.z.a.i.,w...,......,..anu:.,.,^,.n:w`.ii,:...uK:;:bii..,.: .,(cid:9) .^. .w...,.,. ..\n1\t iIS$ DREW;\n2\t Yes.\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nd r\t And you don't feel the necessity of a remand?\n`6\t MISS DREW:\n6\t\nNo, your Honor, we started the school desegrega-\ntion cases years at o --\n8 (cid:9) THE COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n9\t Not to retrace the established decisions, but do\n10 you think there is a necessity for a remand, I take it, as\nti(cid:9) !t to the plan?\n12 ;,(cid:9) MIS S DREW:\n73 it On the plan?\n(cid:9)\n14\t THE OUT: (Judo in pson )\n15 '\t To a oriiulate the Court's decision •••°\ni6(cid:9) MISS DEW:\ni(cid:9) It\n17 s^\t But on the findings, which we think is a matter\n18 (cid:9) of law in this case, loo doni ` t. fe 2l that this Court is <.a: ,:cd '1\n19\t\nt o3 re  vai i\" a a l : 'l;iC3' c plan; under 52 this is a matter of\n20\t«ov? that the District Court found this was a do facto citua-\n11\t €rx,n s\n22\t i :. 4 \t .

NORMAN:\nMay it please the Court, and I'm honored to ap-\nn pear once again before this distinguished Court, represent-\nthe United States in a case which presents, we think,\n12\ndifficult and novel issues.\n13\nThere are two rather distinct issues in our view:\n1.1\nfirst is whether the District Court erred in finding that\n15\nwe had not proved any discrimination In any manner against\nMexican-American students in Austin; and, second, hcthor\nthe District Court erred in approving the Austin School\nEcard plan for desegregation.\nSince those two questions are fairly dio:inct,\nI uld beg leave of the Court to ask Mr. Landsberg at this\ntL to address himself to the question of discrimnation.\nTilE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nVery well, Mr. Lardsbere.\n',\t\n1\n4\n\nMay it please the Court:\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n2(cid:9)\nAre you going to deal with\t question of\n3\t\ndiscrimination against Mexican- Americans?\n4(cid:9)\nMR. LANDSBERG:\n5(cid:9)\nYes, your Honor, and I think that the question\n6\t\n7\t in this case on that issue boils down to whether the\n3\t District Court applied a ;roper standard in deciding\nwhether Mexican-American segregation was the result of\n9\t\nofficial discrimination.\n10(cid:9)\nn\t The standard that was applied by the District\nCourt is not clear. We think that the Court may have been\n12\t\nreferring to and requiring proof of an overt policy of\ndiscrimination against Mexican-Americans.\nlie think that the proper standard is to require\n15\t\n• proof that the school district knowingly assigned students\n16  \nin a manner which the school system could foresee would\nsegregate the children. It chose construction sites, and\ndrew zone lines in such a manner that the natural and\n£oieable consequence was segregation, in s pite of th\nfact that the selection of other sites would have produced\na d;a;rcgaLed school.\nThe District Court's most e::plicit at:ct ell' ant c'\ntc sLandrd that it was applying is fourd onrage three o\n•..\n\nMexican-Americans, but to black students.\nThe Court says, ...the Government has made no\n3 showing that in the period from 1955 tr, the present the\n4 AISD has intentionally perpetuated segregation of blacks. n\n5 The record instead indicates that during this period the\n6 school administration's official acts have not been moti-\n7 vated by any discriminatory purposes.\"\n8 That finding was made in spite of the fact that.\n9 after 1955 the defendants opened four schools not only with\n10 all black student body, but also with all black faculties\n11 assigned to them.\n12 One of those schools, the St. John School was\n13 built in an area which on all four sides was almost entire-\n14 ly white, Anglo.\n15 When that new St. John School opened in 1953,\n16 the Board drew its zone line for the school. It was a\n17 square. The zone line of the adjoining school was in the\nit\n18 form of a closed fist with a thumb sticking up next to the\n19 St. John zone. That thumb was an Anglo residential area.\n2) With respect to the M2xican-Americans the Court\nis not so explicit in requiring a showing of purposefully\n21\nharming children on account of race.\n0\nTIE, COURT: (Judge Coleman)\nIs it o!1-- contention t:h. t: the L, C\t or\n74\n\nwhite race?\n\t\n2 M. LAHDSBERG:\n\t\n3 Your Honor, they are of a different ethnic back-\n\t\n4 ground, and the District Court  held that they were a\n\t separate, identifiable group, minority group, in Austin,\n5\n\t\n6 based not only on prior Court decisions of this Court, and\n\t\n7 the Supreme Court, but based also on the evidence that\n\t\n3 Mexicans had been considered by the community and by the\n\t\n9 school system as constituting a separate minority group.\n\t\n10 THE GOUiT: (Judge Coleman)\n\t\n11 What Itm getting at i5 not what somebody con-\n\t\n12 siders, but what the actual fact and-the constitution re-\n\t\n13 quires. It seems to me, to come right dour to  the point,\n()\n\t\n14 that Mexican-American people are certainly not black. It\n\t\n15 seems that they have always been considered to be whit-_\n- \t \t ---\n16 people, and as\t far aas I knorw Ma_t is ine corrcct coiia'\n17 tion.\n18\t . Now, are we going to set up a new standard by\n19 which we do not go on race, but we go on ethnic background?\n20 THE COURT: (Judge Uidom)\n21 You had that in, of course, Ilernsndez a;aic\nTexas, which answers that question.\n22\nflR.

LAITDSBERG:\n16(cid:9)\n17\t I think that the analysis of whether the Mexican-\nAr:iericans constitute a separate group would be the same\n19\t for both purposes, where in both cases we're talicing ebout\nthe apolication of the equal o1ction Clause.\nclause o.OeS nut ucitcai1y mention race.

For example, Polish people could be con-\n3\t\nsidered separate and apart from the Irish, and so forth.\n4\t\n'llL LANDS3RG:\n5(cid:9)\nIf the record were to substantiate the distinction\n6\t\nyes.\n7(cid:9)\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n3(cid:9)\n9\t That brings up this question: In addition to\n10 11 the Hernandez against Texas and other cases recognizing\n11\t Nexican-Americens as a separate ethnic group which may be\ndiscriminated against as a group, what does the record\n12\t\nshow with respect to discrimination in Austin?\n13\t\n  I.M.

LANDSBEG:\n3\nAnd the Court makes findings on pages two and\n4\nthree which are very general in nature, and in footnote\n5\neleven and twelve, in-essence, the finding that the Austin\n6\nIndependent School District has never adopted, published\n7\n8 or promulgated any written or unwi4tten rules, regulations\nor policies having as the purpose o discriminate against\n9\nor segregate or the isolation of -Mexican-Americans. And\n10\nthat the Austin Independent School District has never\n11\ndiscriminated axciinst, or attempted to discriminate against,\n12\nisolate, or segregate iioxican-Amricans in any form whatso-\n13\never.\n14\nAnd then t.--e Court says, particularly in an\n15\nanalysis of various aspects of school operation, such as\n16\nsite locations, school construction, and that finding was\n17\nmade in spite of another finding that at least two Mexican-\n18\nAmerican schools had du.ul overlapping zones with Anglo\n19\npreo:iivant1y  schools, and that tise --'tools\n20 SChOOlS,  !flgiO \nwere referred to as a:;ica-AmerLcan schools, and that\n21\nthey were nlays Mexican-PtTierican schools.\n2(cid:9)\nThe testiony,\t to which the Court\t kes one\np\t sin1 ;sss ;hst in-Aricns w:re\nI\n\nduring the period before 1955.\t They were expected to go\n2\t to the Zavala School, if they 1iicd i the Zavala-Metz\n3(cid:9) area.

Alfred.\n4 Judge Allred was at that time Judge for the\n5 Southern District of Texas. The State of Texas has long\nbeen aware that by the operation of its school system, that\n7 it could effectively discriminate against the Mexican\n3 Americans in violation of Mexican-Americans' constitutional\n9 rights.\n10 As a result of thisdecision, there was great\n11 scrutiny by the school system in Texas. *There was a great\n12 deal of academic or scholarly interest in our schools as\n13 to how we were handling the Mexican-American problem. ETerc\n14 we doing our best to educate those children in a non-\n15 discriminatory fashion?\n16 Fortunately for Austin, I believe, A great number\n17 of candidates for advance degrees dt the University of\n18 Texas wrote their theses and their dissertations on the\n19 study of this issue.\nind in each instance, Dr. Sanchez, who appeacd\n20\nalready as a w5tness in this case,  on the de;rees\n21 W,115 \ncori.t;ce\t Jnd in depth studies were done. Wat tho;\n22\nstudies iich are in evidcrce clearly indated by e1Eaed\nL(cid:9) £ L U(cid:9) tJ.)L1J\n\n(cid:9) of Texas.\n1\n(cid:9) But, in each instance, Austin was pointed to with\n2\n(cid:9) pride as being a school system which hd sincerely and\n3\n(cid:9) honestly strove to offer the best possible education to\n4\n(cid:9) meet the special needs of those children.\n5\n(cid:9) It is clearly developed that the Mexican-American\n6\n(cid:9) in Austin was a displaced person. He had originally been\n7\n(cid:9) along the Rio Grande River. He had been displaced by the,\n8\n(cid:9)\n9 intrusion of wetback labor, by Brazeros, and he came to\n(cid:9) Austin with agricultural skills. And Austin is not a great\n10\n11(cid:9) agricultural community-\nSo, when he arrived there he found that his main\n12\t\nmeans of livelihood was to follow the migratory labor\n13\t\npattern, which is still a problem but far less a problem\n14 11 \nfor these people than it was before.\n15\t\n1 would say that up until World War II, and the\n16\t\nrecords so indicate, the Ixican-Amnrican was primarily an\n17\t\nagricultural worker. And, if you lived in Austin, there\n18\t\n1 was no place for him to ply his talents on a regular basis,\n19 \nAncL the noral pattern of those children was to be taen\n20\t\nof a school in early April, mid-April at the latest,\nOUt \n21\t\nand to f1thz the harvest over the nation, and to return cc\n22\t\nU seho1 y3tem around the 3.5th of Noveniber, reaching its\n--':\t LT\nJrLcn\t p}r cc\n25(cid:9) .(cid:9) _\n\nWorld Jar Ii, was found in the Austin school system.\n2\nNow, this generated two problems.\t It was not a\n3 problem of the child; it was a problet* of the child's\n0\nopportunity.\t He was permitted to attend school half a day -\n5 not half a day, but half a session.\t He had no real \nOp-\n6 portunity to keep up with the nre advantaged children who\n7 attended school on a full time basis.\nh\nSo, the natural and normal, inescapable result of\nthat was siraply that they did not reach grade level, that\n10 you had children twelve, thirteen and fourteen years old\nin the first grade, with six and seven year old children.\n12 Now, where the only evidence in this record of any\ndiscrimination by the Austin school district are excerpts\n14 from minutes in which there are references to some sehoola\n13\nas being 'iexican schools,\" and we would readily admit it\n1\nat this moment that they were really\t exicanschools, that\n17 they were designed to meet the needs, the special ncds of\n18 the Me.icari-American child, where he would or could go to\n19\nget an ordinary type of education, ha didn't complete high\n20\nschool\t he was too far bchind.\t So w'a\t have, and\n21\npointed to, and this is disturbing if you're proud of a\n2 system, rhat we have ws at all tims in the tocal hi:ory\n2 of the Austin school districs from its tgLiiL:g\t I 1iLl\n21 the e1iest rrcord we could ftd -\t n\niS.S\t :.S\t ................\t S\t 55\n.S* 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1(cid:9) child being denied access to any school.\n(cid:9)\n2 And every student, every school in the City of\n(cid:9)\n3 Austin and all of the students have cotsfstently, through\n(cid:9)\n4 the years, had a Mexican-American component. So we're\n(cid:9)\n5 pointed to as being discriminatory because two things oc-\n(cid:9)\n6 curred:\n(cid:9)\n7 First,\t say that in Austin originally, the\n(cid:9)\n3 good part of Austin, the wealthy part of Austin, the silk\n(cid:9)\n9 stocking district in Austin -- all the Tenth Ward -- was\n(cid:9)\n10 once down in the Zavala area that we are talking about\n(cid:9)\n11 now, and has converted to a largely Mexican-American popula-j\n(cid:9)\n12 tion. In that area we had the Palm School, and we had\n(cid:9)\n13 Metz, and all of these schools had a substantial xican-\n(cid:9)\n14 American coonent at all times.\n(cid:9)\n15 Now, on account of the problem of the children\n16 who came late, and who were over age in grade, our school\n17 system decided that there should be a sp:cial school to\n18 which voluntary access was accorded. No forcing.\t Anyone\n19 could go who wanted to go, but schools that would 'have a\ncurriculum that would meet the special needs of these\n20\npeople.\n21\nSin our e1cccntaory schools -- but  first let\n22(cid:9) , \nme say, or let me call this a satellite\t this is a coimon,\n23\ngood word. t:he9e rcr Pemce i Cwwl. mw\t wr\n4I..---(cid:9) -------..-4-\n\nAmerican students.\nNow, if we are looking for de jure segregation\nthat-  is brought about there the building had the purpose or\nthe effect of achieving segregation, then we can lay aside\nA h \ncompletely the West Avenue School that you see so much of in\n6(cid:9) this brief, because it was long ago closed, and there is\nnot a Mexican-American community in that area and has not\nbeen for a number of years. It didrt have the effect of,\nor had no effect on residential patterns. When the school\n10(cid:9) was closed there were no more Mexican-Americans in that\narea.\nNow, ov6r on the other side, in this. Zavala\n12\t\n13 School, and you first had the Comal School, which goes back\n14 for a number of years, and there is no complete record on\nit, but the Comal School was closed at the request of  the\ncomlnity, and a new school was built,\n16 Mexican-American \nthe Zavala Schaol, as the Mexican school, and it is so\n17\nidentified, and I say that it-;.-as a Mexican school.\nVIE COTJT: (Judge Siçson)\n19\nIIc;; ±r apart, or \t is the diatance betTeen\n20\nthe Comls foruer location and where the Zavala was built?\n21\ni2 •\n22\nIt wou]d be in tLo sakmo school district, a ratter\n23\nor five block;3\n32\n\n_.z,\nIn the sarac school district?\n2 T1IOiAS:\n3 In the sarac school district.\nTHE COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n5 The same school district, but that is in the\n6 Austin school district, the same neighborhood? \t -\n.

THOMAS:\n12\ns.\n13 TIM COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n14 Did I understand that this was a voluntary thing?\n15 THONA S:\n• \n1 The child had the opportunity to stay at hom,\n17 to go to school, and if he wanted to go to Netz School,\nthe rccu:d shows that in these years there was about a tan\n19 per ccnL; oif\t cL\t\nthat was I\t :icanAicriccn,\t hsn the\n20 Zavala School wos built.\t And in that school, you had a\n21 phys&cai cducatioa departcnt and\n22 T!.(cid:9) C)U2,T:(cid:9) (Judc Wisdom)\nidca of cverlap:ng zl:w\nto a;y\n\n1(cid:9) litigation.\n2 THE COUPT: (Judge Wisdom)\n3 I mean in this litigation iwas not attacked?\n4 1 0\nLU.(cid:9) J AJ(cid:9) .\n5 Well,it was pointed to as being, yes, being\n6 evidence of dtscrimination.\n7 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n8\nThis is the point I was making.\n9 THOMAS:\n10 Yes.\n11 There is the argument. that is made, simply saying\n12 that we went in there and met the special education needs.\n13 We had physical educton structures in that school, where\n14 we had thorn in no other elementary school. Ile taught\n15 industrial ar which was not taught in any other. We\n16 taught homemaking in that school, where we didn't have that\n17 in any other school, and we did this in order to meet the\n18 social needs of these Mcmican-Amer leans, these  children.\n19 As reflected by these records, we put: in the first\n20 visiting teacher prograra Jad the visiting teacher pro-\nII\ngram was really a Social worker, •and he was paid the trurit\n21\nofficer 2 s salary, a gcndciiisn fr_o'Hm:om the Truant Office, nd\n22\ncie called hii a viciting teacher; and we put c social\n23\nworker t;ere to rf o ini:e(cid:9) -h\nLy(cid:9) Cc\n.1\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nschool, and to try to get their parents to participate in\nschool activities.\n2(cid:9)\nis \n3\t This  the kind of school system that Austin has\nrun, and throughout the time we were meeting those special\n5\t education needs and we have continued to try to do it by\nthe curriculum, bilingual programs then, and during the\n6\ntime ie were trying to do this. And in the Austin school\n7(cid:9) 11\n8\t system they had all the athletic and extra-curricula\nactivities, and not a sign, not a point of any discrimina-\n9\n10\t tion against the Mexican-Americn child.\n11\t So then, wd get on the other part of this Mexican\n12\t American problem, and to say that we have designed some\n13\t shool location3c that had the purp ose or the effect of\n14\t segregating theMexican-American, that simply is not con-\nsistent with the ffacts.\n15(cid:9)\n16\t In 19!:6, and this is a splendid school system\n17\t that ware talking about here today, but in 1946 we hired\n18\t a professional engineering firm to make a twenty-year\nprojcton of the educational needs of Austin, to make the\n20\t site scq'iitions.

The Court has ruled that black schools can be\n(cid:9) c1oc.d to effect desegretion if the plants are physically\n22\n(cid:9)\n23 inadRJate, if the sites arc in equate and if the ir.; act\nof these ti .ngs proved in this c;c\n23(cid:9) one \n7!,.\n\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n1(cid:9)\n2\t We have also gaid that if the closinZof school\n3\t imposes a burden on the blacks not imposed upon whites,\t\n0\n4(cid:9) that that is improper.(cid:9) -.\n5 MISS DREii:\n6 Yes, your Honor.\n7 And this Court has also ruled that it is improper\n8 where it is done for reasons of avoiding white f light\n9 And I think that there is ample testimony in the record\n10 that that is why the black schools were . closed in these\n11 cases, because they felt that the white studepts uould not\n12 attend formerly black schools.\n13 There are several schools which are smaller and\nmore adequate from every standpoint than the schools closed\n14\nin this instance. And we ask the Court to require those\n15\nschools to be reopened and used within the system with the\n16\n17 other school,-,\n18 . The other point that I would raise is that the\nCourt fId. tat the irltarv3norc, Loth b1:. nrid \t icn-\n19\nAcericar, ask the Court to find that the discrimination,\n20\nincident3 of disc:imination in this systeLi, are sufficiett\n21\ntern or cyst\t -L.?a discrimirti\n-(cid:9) 22 to(cid:9) t:1-3.h i r: \ncn -2xic\t !icans at tc ::eit\n23(cid:9) ai:C L.0(cid:9)\nhasis.\n25(cid:9)\n/3\n\nI\t We don't think it is necebsary to remand for\nfurther hearing for a finding of discrimination against\neither group. The record is clear, we feel, with the in-\n4 of segregation of both groups.\n\t\nI\t We might also point out that it is discriminatory\n6\t against blacks to establish a secondary plan as has been\n7 done here ) which does not include desegregation of the\ni Meiean -Amer ican students.\n2(cid:9) Blacks have a right, under the desegregation pro- \nI\n10\t cess, to be integrated in the whole system with all of the\nstudents in the system. If that happens to include a\n12 Mexican-Any_rican or some Chinese children, or any other\nminority, those children should be included in the plan.\n14 I think that there is no possible way of working\nat a desegre;ation plan that does not include all \ngroups,\n16\t without discrirainating unconstitionally against the black\n17 children.\n18 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n19 You take the position that the record i clear\n20 that there was system-wide discrimin ation against blacks?\n21 NISS DREW:\n1gainst blacks and\ndiscrimintiori\nAnd\t cLfrericans, too?\n7$\n\n\t\n..o:.,..:4_•.4..,s`..,,a.e.rax!^a..,.e.w•.c'::sa,.::..,.,-.........-N:::.A:Cr nw:«.:,_, ,ex..r ._,..•.w.A:., .,,.,.x'w :c^:...u::.1::.a:aw.z.a.i.,w...,......,..anu:.,.,^,.n:w`.ii,:...uK:;:bii..,.: .,(cid:9) .^. .w...,.,. ..\n1\t iIS$ DREW;\n2\t Yes.\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nd r\t And you don't feel the necessity of a remand?\n`6\t MISS DREW:\n6\t\nNo, your Honor, we started the school desegrega-\ntion cases years at o --\n8 (cid:9) THE COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n9\t Not to retrace the established decisions, but do\n10 you think there is a necessity for a remand, I take it, as\nti(cid:9) !t to the plan?\n12 ;,(cid:9) MIS S DREW:\n73 it On the plan?\n(cid:9)\n14\t THE OUT: (Judo in pson )\n15 '\t To a oriiulate the Court's decision •••°\ni6(cid:9) MISS DEW:\ni(cid:9) It\n17 s^\t But on the findings, which we think is a matter\n18 (cid:9) of law in this case, loo doni ` t. fe 2l that this Court is <.a: ,:cd '1\n19\t\nt o3 re  vai i\" a a l : 'l;iC3' c plan; under 52 this is a matter of\n20\t«ov? that the District Court found this was a do facto citua-\n11\t €rx,n s\n22\t i :. 4 \t .

NORMAN:\nMay it please the Court, and I'm honored to ap-\nn pear once again before this distinguished Court, represent-\nthe United States in a case which presents, we think,\n12\ndifficult and novel issues.\n13\nThere are two rather distinct issues in our view:\n1.1\nfirst is whether the District Court erred in finding that\n15\nwe had not proved any discrimination In any manner against\nMexican-American students in Austin; and, second, hcthor\nthe District Court erred in approving the Austin School\nEcard plan for desegregation.\nSince those two questions are fairly dio:inct,\nI uld beg leave of the Court to ask Mr. Landsberg at this\ntL to address himself to the question of discrimnation.\nTilE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nVery well, Mr. Lardsbere.\n',\t\n1\n4\n\nMay it please the Court:\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n2(cid:9)\nAre you going to deal with\t question of\n3\t\ndiscrimination against Mexican- Americans?\n4(cid:9)\nMR. LANDSBERG:\n5(cid:9)\nYes, your Honor, and I think that the question\n6\t\n7\t in this case on that issue boils down to whether the\n3\t District Court applied a ;roper standard in deciding\nwhether Mexican-American segregation was the result of\n9\t\nofficial discrimination.\n10(cid:9)\nn\t The standard that was applied by the District\nCourt is not clear. We think that the Court may have been\n12\t\nreferring to and requiring proof of an overt policy of\ndiscrimination against Mexican-Americans.\nlie think that the proper standard is to require\n15\t\n• proof that the school district knowingly assigned students\n16  \nin a manner which the school system could foresee would\nsegregate the children. It chose construction sites, and\ndrew zone lines in such a manner that the natural and\n£oieable consequence was segregation, in s pite of th\nfact that the selection of other sites would have produced\na d;a;rcgaLed school.\nThe District Court's most e::plicit at:ct ell' ant c'\ntc sLandrd that it was applying is fourd onrage three o\n•..\n\nMexican-Americans, but to black students.\nThe Court says, ...the Government has made no\n3 showing that in the period from 1955 tr, the present the\n4 AISD has intentionally perpetuated segregation of blacks. n\n5 The record instead indicates that during this period the\n6 school administration's official acts have not been moti-\n7 vated by any discriminatory purposes.\"\n8 That finding was made in spite of the fact that.\n9 after 1955 the defendants opened four schools not only with\n10 all black student body, but also with all black faculties\n11 assigned to them.\n12 One of those schools, the St. John School was\n13 built in an area which on all four sides was almost entire-\n14 ly white, Anglo.\n15 When that new St. John School opened in 1953,\n16 the Board drew its zone line for the school. It was a\n17 square. The zone line of the adjoining school was in the\nit\n18 form of a closed fist with a thumb sticking up next to the\n19 St. John zone. That thumb was an Anglo residential area.\n2) With respect to the M2xican-Americans the Court\nis not so explicit in requiring a showing of purposefully\n21\nharming children on account of race.\n0\nTIE, COURT: (Judge Coleman)\nIs it o!1-- contention t:h. t: the L, C\t or\n74\n\nwhite race?\n\t\n2 M. LAHDSBERG:\n\t\n3 Your Honor, they are of a different ethnic back-\n\t\n4 ground, and the District Court  held that they were a\n\t separate, identifiable group, minority group, in Austin,\n5\n\t\n6 based not only on prior Court decisions of this Court, and\n\t\n7 the Supreme Court, but based also on the evidence that\n\t\n3 Mexicans had been considered by the community and by the\n\t\n9 school system as constituting a separate minority group.\n\t\n10 THE GOUiT: (Judge Coleman)\n\t\n11 What Itm getting at i5 not what somebody con-\n\t\n12 siders, but what the actual fact and-the constitution re-\n\t\n13 quires. It seems to me, to come right dour to  the point,\n()\n\t\n14 that Mexican-American people are certainly not black. It\n\t\n15 seems that they have always been considered to be whit-_\n- \t \t ---\n16 people, and as\t far aas I knorw Ma_t is ine corrcct coiia'\n17 tion.\n18\t . Now, are we going to set up a new standard by\n19 which we do not go on race, but we go on ethnic background?\n20 THE COURT: (Judge Uidom)\n21 You had that in, of course, Ilernsndez a;aic\nTexas, which answers that question.\n22\nflR.

LAITDSBERG:\n16(cid:9)\n17\t I think that the analysis of whether the Mexican-\nAr:iericans constitute a separate group would be the same\n19\t for both purposes, where in both cases we're talicing ebout\nthe apolication of the equal o1ction Clause.\nclause o.OeS nut ucitcai1y mention race.

LANDSBEG:\n3\nAnd the Court makes findings on pages two and\n4\nthree which are very general in nature, and in footnote\n5\neleven and twelve, in-essence, the finding that the Austin\n6\nIndependent School District has never adopted, published\n7\n8 or promulgated any written or unwi4tten rules, regulations\nor policies having as the purpose o discriminate against\n9\nor segregate or the isolation of -Mexican-Americans. And\n10\nthat the Austin Independent School District has never\n11\ndiscriminated axciinst, or attempted to discriminate against,\n12\nisolate, or segregate iioxican-Amricans in any form whatso-\n13\never.\n14\nAnd then t.--e Court says, particularly in an\n15\nanalysis of various aspects of school operation, such as\n16\nsite locations, school construction, and that finding was\n17\nmade in spite of another finding that at least two Mexican-\n18\nAmerican schools had du.ul overlapping zones with Anglo\n19\npreo:iivant1y  schools, and that tise --'tools\n20 SChOOlS,  !flgiO \nwere referred to as a:;ica-AmerLcan schools, and that\n21\nthey were nlays Mexican-PtTierican schools.\n2(cid:9)\nThe testiony,\t to which the Court\t kes one\np\t sin1 ;sss ;hst in-Aricns w:re\nI\n\nduring the period before 1955.\t They were expected to go\n2\t to the Zavala School, if they 1iicd i the Zavala-Metz\n3(cid:9) area.

Which, I\n12 don't think is a necessary assumption under the Swann case.\nCertainly, that would require massive busing,\n13\n1(cid:9) .J\nand I think a lot of busing may be necessary under a plan\n15 which is geared to relief of the violation.\n16 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n17 The Government's position really is that the\nproblem is more, piecemaal than system-wide, is that\n(cid:9)\n19 correct?\n201 ,,771\t 4.\t •\nYes, sir.\nCc-U:T: (J\t\nTHE Iis2oni)\nJmd that, tThcrefore, the plan ha3 to be tailored\np:;ce11\t J r-i\nir\n\nMR NORMAN:\n2\t Yes, your Honor, and the reason is that we did\ni \n3\t not prove nor  it true that a traditionally dual school\nexisted for tho Ne:ican-Arnericans in Austin prior\nsystem \n5  to Brown. So we are thrown into a new kind of case in this\nL\n6\t Court, the case in which the Court is asked to decide as\nwell as the District Court, first, where is there discrimina-\ntion, if any? And what does it tai l to remedy it against\n\t\n9 Nexican-Amerioans?\n\t\n10 We are in the situation in Austin where, and I\n\t\n11 believe the Austin School Board has agreed, that they did\n\t\n12 have a traditionally dual system for the blacks. They did\n13\t not have for the Mexican-Americans.\n14\t ThE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n15\t But when new schools are constructed today,\n16\t yesterday, or subsequent to Brown, and the site selection\n17\t in effect determines the com?ccition of the school, in\n18\t effect you have de jure or more than that, or, in fact,\n19\t you have de jure segregation.\nu1d you adnt that that is a fair stuerent?\n23\t Wo\nIRR•\n21\t\nI don't thik this follows utonatically, iu\nlU;dom.

Alfred.\n4 Judge Allred was at that time Judge for the\n5 Southern District of Texas. The State of Texas has long\nbeen aware that by the operation of its school system, that\n7 it could effectively discriminate against the Mexican\n3 Americans in violation of Mexican-Americans' constitutional\n9 rights.\n10 As a result of thisdecision, there was great\n11 scrutiny by the school system in Texas. *There was a great\n12 deal of academic or scholarly interest in our schools as\n13 to how we were handling the Mexican-American problem. ETerc\n14 we doing our best to educate those children in a non-\n15 discriminatory fashion?\n16 Fortunately for Austin, I believe, A great number\n17 of candidates for advance degrees dt the University of\n18 Texas wrote their theses and their dissertations on the\n19 study of this issue.\nind in each instance, Dr. Sanchez, who appeacd\n20\nalready as a w5tness in this case,  on the de;rees\n21 W,115 \ncori.t;ce\t Jnd in depth studies were done. Wat tho;\n22\nstudies iich are in evidcrce clearly indated by e1Eaed\nL(cid:9) £ L U(cid:9) tJ.)L1J\n\n(cid:9) of Texas.\n1\n(cid:9) But, in each instance, Austin was pointed to with\n2\n(cid:9) pride as being a school system which hd sincerely and\n3\n(cid:9) honestly strove to offer the best possible education to\n4\n(cid:9) meet the special needs of those children.\n5\n(cid:9) It is clearly developed that the Mexican-American\n6\n(cid:9) in Austin was a displaced person. He had originally been\n7\n(cid:9) along the Rio Grande River. He had been displaced by the,\n8\n(cid:9)\n9 intrusion of wetback labor, by Brazeros, and he came to\n(cid:9) Austin with agricultural skills. And Austin is not a great\n10\n11(cid:9) agricultural community-\nSo, when he arrived there he found that his main\n12\t\nmeans of livelihood was to follow the migratory labor\n13\t\npattern, which is still a problem but far less a problem\n14 11 \nfor these people than it was before.\n15\t\n1 would say that up until World War II, and the\n16\t\nrecords so indicate, the Ixican-Amnrican was primarily an\n17\t\nagricultural worker. And, if you lived in Austin, there\n18\t\n1 was no place for him to ply his talents on a regular basis,\n19 \nAncL the noral pattern of those children was to be taen\n20\t\nof a school in early April, mid-April at the latest,\nOUt \n21\t\nand to f1thz the harvest over the nation, and to return cc\n22\t\nU seho1 y3tem around the 3.5th of Noveniber, reaching its\n--':\t LT\nJrLcn\t p}r cc\n25(cid:9) .(cid:9) _\n\nWorld Jar Ii, was found in the Austin school system.\n2\nNow, this generated two problems.\t It was not a\n3 problem of the child; it was a problet* of the child's\n0\nopportunity.\t He was permitted to attend school half a day -\n5 not half a day, but half a session.\t He had no real \nOp-\n6 portunity to keep up with the nre advantaged children who\n7 attended school on a full time basis.\nh\nSo, the natural and normal, inescapable result of\nthat was siraply that they did not reach grade level, that\n10 you had children twelve, thirteen and fourteen years old\nin the first grade, with six and seven year old children.\n12 Now, where the only evidence in this record of any\ndiscrimination by the Austin school district are excerpts\n14 from minutes in which there are references to some sehoola\n13\nas being 'iexican schools,\" and we would readily admit it\n1\nat this moment that they were really\t exicanschools, that\n17 they were designed to meet the needs, the special ncds of\n18 the Me.icari-American child, where he would or could go to\n19\nget an ordinary type of education, ha didn't complete high\n20\nschool\t he was too far bchind.\t So w'a\t have, and\n21\npointed to, and this is disturbing if you're proud of a\n2 system, rhat we have ws at all tims in the tocal hi:ory\n2 of the Austin school districs from its tgLiiL:g\t I 1iLl\n21 the e1iest rrcord we could ftd -\t n\niS.S\t :.S\t ................\t S\t 55\n.S* 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1(cid:9) child being denied access to any school.\n(cid:9)\n2 And every student, every school in the City of\n(cid:9)\n3 Austin and all of the students have cotsfstently, through\n(cid:9)\n4 the years, had a Mexican-American component. So we're\n(cid:9)\n5 pointed to as being discriminatory because two things oc-\n(cid:9)\n6 curred:\n(cid:9)\n7 First,\t say that in Austin originally, the\n(cid:9)\n3 good part of Austin, the wealthy part of Austin, the silk\n(cid:9)\n9 stocking district in Austin -- all the Tenth Ward -- was\n(cid:9)\n10 once down in the Zavala area that we are talking about\n(cid:9)\n11 now, and has converted to a largely Mexican-American popula-j\n(cid:9)\n12 tion. In that area we had the Palm School, and we had\n(cid:9)\n13 Metz, and all of these schools had a substantial xican-\n(cid:9)\n14 American coonent at all times.\n(cid:9)\n15 Now, on account of the problem of the children\n16 who came late, and who were over age in grade, our school\n17 system decided that there should be a sp:cial school to\n18 which voluntary access was accorded. No forcing.\t Anyone\n19 could go who wanted to go, but schools that would 'have a\ncurriculum that would meet the special needs of these\n20\npeople.\n21\nSin our e1cccntaory schools -- but  first let\n22(cid:9) , \nme say, or let me call this a satellite\t this is a coimon,\n23\ngood word. t:he9e rcr Pemce i Cwwl. mw\t wr\n4I..---(cid:9) -------..-4-\n\nAmerican students.\nNow, if we are looking for de jure segregation\nthat-  is brought about there the building had the purpose or\nthe effect of achieving segregation, then we can lay aside\nA h \ncompletely the West Avenue School that you see so much of in\n6(cid:9) this brief, because it was long ago closed, and there is\nnot a Mexican-American community in that area and has not\nbeen for a number of years. It didrt have the effect of,\nor had no effect on residential patterns. When the school\n10(cid:9) was closed there were no more Mexican-Americans in that\narea.\nNow, ov6r on the other side, in this. Zavala\n12\t\n13 School, and you first had the Comal School, which goes back\n14 for a number of years, and there is no complete record on\nit, but the Comal School was closed at the request of  the\ncomlnity, and a new school was built,\n16 Mexican-American \nthe Zavala Schaol, as the Mexican school, and it is so\n17\nidentified, and I say that it-;.-as a Mexican school.\nVIE COTJT: (Judge Siçson)\n19\nIIc;; ±r apart, or \t is the diatance betTeen\n20\nthe Comls foruer location and where the Zavala was built?\n21\ni2 •\n22\nIt wou]d be in tLo sakmo school district, a ratter\n23\nor five block;3\n32\n\n_.z,\nIn the sarac school district?\n2 T1IOiAS:\n3 In the sarac school district.\nTHE COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n5 The same school district, but that is in the\n6 Austin school district, the same neighborhood? \t -\n.

THOMAS:\n12\ns.\n13 TIM COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n14 Did I understand that this was a voluntary thing?\n15 THONA S:\n• \n1 The child had the opportunity to stay at hom,\n17 to go to school, and if he wanted to go to Netz School,\nthe rccu:d shows that in these years there was about a tan\n19 per ccnL; oif\t cL\t\nthat was I\t :icanAicriccn,\t hsn the\n20 Zavala School wos built.\t And in that school, you had a\n21 phys&cai cducatioa departcnt and\n22 T!.(cid:9) C)U2,T:(cid:9) (Judc Wisdom)\nidca of cverlap:ng zl:w\nto a;y\n\n1(cid:9) litigation.\n2 THE COUPT: (Judge Wisdom)\n3 I mean in this litigation iwas not attacked?\n4 1 0\nLU.(cid:9) J AJ(cid:9) .\n5 Well,it was pointed to as being, yes, being\n6 evidence of dtscrimination.\n7 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n8\nThis is the point I was making.\n9 THOMAS:\n10 Yes.\n11 There is the argument. that is made, simply saying\n12 that we went in there and met the special education needs.\n13 We had physical educton structures in that school, where\n14 we had thorn in no other elementary school. Ile taught\n15 industrial ar which was not taught in any other. We\n16 taught homemaking in that school, where we didn't have that\n17 in any other school, and we did this in order to meet the\n18 social needs of these Mcmican-Amer leans, these  children.\n19 As reflected by these records, we put: in the first\n20 visiting teacher prograra Jad the visiting teacher pro-\nII\ngram was really a Social worker, •and he was paid the trurit\n21\nofficer 2 s salary, a gcndciiisn fr_o'Hm:om the Truant Office, nd\n22\ncie called hii a viciting teacher; and we put c social\n23\nworker t;ere to rf o ini:e(cid:9) -h\nLy(cid:9) Cc\n.1\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nschool, and to try to get their parents to participate in\nschool activities.\n2(cid:9)\nis \n3\t This  the kind of school system that Austin has\nrun, and throughout the time we were meeting those special\n5\t education needs and we have continued to try to do it by\nthe curriculum, bilingual programs then, and during the\n6\ntime ie were trying to do this. And in the Austin school\n7(cid:9) 11\n8\t system they had all the athletic and extra-curricula\nactivities, and not a sign, not a point of any discrimina-\n9\n10\t tion against the Mexican-Americn child.\n11\t So then, wd get on the other part of this Mexican\n12\t American problem, and to say that we have designed some\n13\t shool location3c that had the purp ose or the effect of\n14\t segregating theMexican-American, that simply is not con-\nsistent with the ffacts.\n15(cid:9)\n16\t In 19!:6, and this is a splendid school system\n17\t that ware talking about here today, but in 1946 we hired\n18\t a professional engineering firm to make a twenty-year\nprojcton of the educational needs of Austin, to make the\n20\t site scq'iitions.

The Court has ruled that black schools can be\n(cid:9) c1oc.d to effect desegretion if the plants are physically\n22\n(cid:9)\n23 inadRJate, if the sites arc in equate and if the ir.; act\nof these ti .ngs proved in this c;c\n23(cid:9) one \n7!,.\n\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n1(cid:9)\n2\t We have also gaid that if the closinZof school\n3\t imposes a burden on the blacks not imposed upon whites,\t\n0\n4(cid:9) that that is improper.(cid:9) -.\n5 MISS DREii:\n6 Yes, your Honor.\n7 And this Court has also ruled that it is improper\n8 where it is done for reasons of avoiding white f light\n9 And I think that there is ample testimony in the record\n10 that that is why the black schools were . closed in these\n11 cases, because they felt that the white studepts uould not\n12 attend formerly black schools.\n13 There are several schools which are smaller and\nmore adequate from every standpoint than the schools closed\n14\nin this instance. And we ask the Court to require those\n15\nschools to be reopened and used within the system with the\n16\n17 other school,-,\n18 . The other point that I would raise is that the\nCourt fId. tat the irltarv3norc, Loth b1:. nrid \t icn-\n19\nAcericar, ask the Court to find that the discrimination,\n20\nincident3 of disc:imination in this systeLi, are sufficiett\n21\ntern or cyst\t -L.?a discrimirti\n-(cid:9) 22 to(cid:9) t:1-3.h i r: \ncn -2xic\t !icans at tc ::eit\n23(cid:9) ai:C L.0(cid:9)\nhasis.\n25(cid:9)\n/3\n\nI\t We don't think it is necebsary to remand for\nfurther hearing for a finding of discrimination against\neither group. The record is clear, we feel, with the in-\n4 of segregation of both groups.\n\t\nI\t We might also point out that it is discriminatory\n6\t against blacks to establish a secondary plan as has been\n7 done here ) which does not include desegregation of the\ni Meiean -Amer ican students.\n2(cid:9) Blacks have a right, under the desegregation pro- \nI\n10\t cess, to be integrated in the whole system with all of the\nstudents in the system. If that happens to include a\n12 Mexican-Any_rican or some Chinese children, or any other\nminority, those children should be included in the plan.\n14 I think that there is no possible way of working\nat a desegre;ation plan that does not include all \ngroups,\n16\t without discrirainating unconstitionally against the black\n17 children.\n18 THE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\n19 You take the position that the record i clear\n20 that there was system-wide discrimin ation against blacks?\n21 NISS DREW:\n1gainst blacks and\ndiscrimintiori\nAnd\t cLfrericans, too?\n7$\n\n\t\n..o:.,..:4_•.4..,s`..,,a.e.rax!^a..,.e.w•.c'::sa,.::..,.,-.........-N:::.A:Cr nw:«.:,_, ,ex..r ._,..•.w.A:., .,,.,.x'w :c^:...u::.1::.a:aw.z.a.i.,w...,......,..anu:.,.,^,.n:w`.ii,:...uK:;:bii..,.: .,(cid:9) .^. .w...,.,. ..\n1\t iIS$ DREW;\n2\t Yes.\nTHE COURT: (Judge Wisdom)\nd r\t And you don't feel the necessity of a remand?\n`6\t MISS DREW:\n6\t\nNo, your Honor, we started the school desegrega-\ntion cases years at o --\n8 (cid:9) THE COURT: (Judge Simpson)\n9\t Not to retrace the established decisions, but do\n10 you think there is a necessity for a remand, I take it, as\nti(cid:9) !t to the plan?\n12 ;,(cid:9) MIS S DREW:\n73 it On the plan?\n(cid:9)\n14\t THE OUT: (Judo in pson )\n15 '\t To a oriiulate the Court's decision •••°\ni6(cid:9) MISS DEW:\ni(cid:9) It\n17 s^\t But on the findings, which we think is a matter\n18 (cid:9) of law in this case, loo doni ` t. fe 2l that this Court is <.a: ,:cd '1\n19\t\nt o3 re  vai i\" a a l : 'l;iC3' c plan; under 52 this is a matter of\n20\t«ov? that the District Court found this was a do facto citua-\n11\t €rx,n s\n22\t i :. 4 \t .

Procedural History\nThis school desegregation case was filed by the United\nStates pursuant to Section 407(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a) and (b), on August 7, 1970\nagainst the Texas Education Agency and seven independent\nschool districts, including the Austin Independent School\nDistrict (hereinafter, the defendants or the AISD), located in the\nWestern District of Texas. The complaint alleged that these\nschool districts had traditionally operated dual school sys-\ntems based on race and that their present student and faculty\nassignment policies had failed to eliminate all vestiges of\nthese dual systems. In addition, it was alleged that three\nof the local districts, including the AISD, were discrimina-\ntorily assigning Mexican-American students to schools identi-\nfiable as Mexican-American schools or as schools intended for\n1.J\nonly black and Mexican-American students.\n1/ After this complaint was filed, a motion to intervene as\nplaintiff and complaint in intervention were filed on behalf\nof Mexican-American students. This motion was denied by the\ncourt on August 24, 1970. Subsequently, in February, 1971 a\nseparate action was brought on behalf of the Mexican-Americans\nagainst the AISD. On June 10, 1971 the court denied the motion\nof plaintiffs in that case for consolidation and joint hearing\nof that case with this action.\n-2 -\n\nOn August 7, 1970 the district court issued an order\nrequiring the defendants, among others, to formulate and submit a\ndesegregation plan to the Texas Education Agency and repre-\nsentatives of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\n(hereinafter HEW). If no agreement was reached between the\nparties as to an acceptable plan, the defendant school dis-\ntricts and HEW were to file respective plans with the court.\nA hearing concerning the plans developed for the defendants was held\non August 27, 1970 at which the United States submitted an\ninterim desegregation plan prepared by HEW. After the hearing\nthe district court orally ordered that this interim plan be\nimplemented immediately. On September 4, 1970 the district\ncourt amended the oral order in a written order requiring\nimmediate implementation of the standard provisions of Single-\nton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School System, 419 F. 2d\n1211 (5th Cir. 1969) pertaining to faculty and staff, con-\nstruction, transportation, majority-to-minority transfer pro-\nvisions and attendance outside the system. In addition, HEW\nwas ordered to conduct a comprehensive study of the Austin School\nDistrict and prepare a plan to completely desegregate all schools in\n\n2/\nthe district.(cid:9) Following court orders of December 15, 1970,\nIF.\nFebruary 26, 1971, April 14, 1971 and May 7, 1971 extending\nthe date for filing plans, the parties filed desegregation\n3/\nplans with the district court on May 14, 1971.\nA six day trial on the merits was held June 14 through\nJune 21, 1971. On June 28, 1971 the district court entered\na memorandum opinion and order which found that, while Mexican-\nAmericans constituted a separate ethnic minority in Austin, no\nde jure discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin\nhad been practiced against Mexican-Americans in the operation\nof the AISD. As to blacks, the court found that vestiges of\nthe dual school system based on race still existed. The court\nordered the parties to renegotiate in an effort to reach agree-\nment on a common plan based on these findings and upon certain\nguidelines contained in the order.\n2/ Defendants' Officials were ordered to consult and cooperate\nwith HEW in preparation of the plan; if the parties were able\nto agree upon a plan, it was to be submitted to the court by\n15, \nDecember  1970, and if the parties failed to agree, separate\nplans were to be filed by the parties.\n3/ Defendants' plan as filed on May 14, 1971 is contained\nin Defendants Exhibits 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. The\nplan was updated and modified slightly at trial. (See Def. Ex.\n77, 78 and 80; Tr. 930-933.) The HEW plan was filed in the\nform of a letter to Dr. Jack Davidson commenting on  defendants'\nproposal and making further recommendations.\n\nThe parties jointly reported to the district court on\nJuly 15, 1971 that although agreement had been reached on de-\nfendants' high school plan, 4/ disagreements still existed\nconcerning the junior high and elementary school plans. On\nJuly 19, 1971 the district court entered another memorandum\nopinion and order approving the defendants' desegregation plan,\nand notice of appeal from both the June 28 and July 19, 1971\nmemorandum opinions and orders was filed by the United States\non August 3, 1971.\n2. Decision of the Court Below on Discrimination\nIn its June 28, 1971, Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nthe district court specifically found that Mexican-Americans\nconstitute a separate ethnic group in Austin. However, the\ncourt held that there has been no de jure discrimination\nagainst Mexican-Americans, based on its findings of fact set\nout as follows:\n4/ Agreement upon the high school plan was based upon the\ncourt's finding of June 28, 1971 and it was stated that nothing\nin this report was to be read to indicate agreement with those\nfindings by both parties.\n- 5 -\n\n(a) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever adopted, published or promulgated any\nwritten or unwritten rules, regulation or\npolicies having as their purpose the dis-\ncrimination against, or segregation or iso-\nlation of, Mexican Americans.\n(b) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever discriminated against, or attempted to\ndiscriminate against, isolate or segregate\nMexican Americans in any form whatsoever,\nparticularly in:\n(1) site location of schools;\n(2) school construction;\n(3) drawing of school attendance zones;\n(4) student assignments;\n(5) faculty assignments;\n(6) staff assignments;\n(7) faculty and staff employment;\n(8) extracurricular activities; and\n(9) transportation.\n(c) The Zavala and West Elementary Schools were not\nbuilt for the purpose of discriminating against,\nisolating or segregating students on the basis\nof Mexican American ethnic origin. 5/\nThe court also found that vestiges of the previous dual\nsystem with respect to black students still exist. Because of\nthe general nature of the court's findings on the question of\ndiscrimination, we will set out the facts in this area in some\ndetail.\n5/ Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 2 and\nfootnote 12. Despite finding no de jure segregation against\nMexican-Americans, the court stated it would \"consider the\neffect\" upon Mexican-Americans of any plan submitted by the\nparties. Id, p. 6.\n- 6 -\n\n3. Facts\nA. School District Demography\nThe AISD encompasses the City of Austin and some\nterritory outside the city limits, extending approximately\n30 miles north and south and about 25 miles east and west,\nwith a total area of 230 square miles. During the 1970-71\nschool year a total of 35,496 (657.) Anglo students, 11,194\n(20%) Mexican American students and 8,284 (1570) black\nstudents were enrolled in 74 schools in the district. (Def.\nEx. 79) .\nThe black and Mexican-American populations are con-\ncentrated largely in a region known as East Austin, an area\nbounded roughly by an interstate highway and downtown Austin\non the west, 19th Street and the municipal airport on the\nnorth, the Colorado River (and old Colorado school district)\n6/\non the south, and the school district line on the east. The\nblack population is generally concentrated in the northern\nsector of this area, while the Mexican-American population\n6/ The vast majority of the city's low income families are\namong the minority 35 percent of the population and are con-\ncentrated in the eastern part of the city. (Def. Ex. 42, p. 9).\n- 7 -\n\n7 /\nresides primarily in the southern sector. (See Appendix C to Brief) I+.\nA total of eighteen schools, all of which are over 907. minority,(cid:9) I'\nare located in this area; eight of these schools are over 95%\n(cid:9)\nblack, four are over 957 Mexican-American, and six are over\nICY\n90. Mexican-American and black. Approximately 77% of the dis-\ntrict's black students and 597. of the district's Mexican-\n8/\nAmerican students attended these schools in 1970-71.^\nOutside of East Austin the population is primarily Anglo,\nbut there are three schools with a minority enrollment of over\n70%. There is a small black community in the north central por-\ntion of the district served by the St. Johns Elementary School\n(987. minority in 1970-71); a concentration of Mexican-Americans\nsouth of the river and west of the interstate served by the\nBecker Elementary School (75% minority in 1970-71); and a pre-\ndominantly minority area directly north of East Austin between\nthe airport and the interstate, served by the Maplewood Ele-\nmentary School (707. minority in 1970-71). Prior to the 1969-70\nschool year this was a white Anglo school.\n7/ Defendants' Exhibits 5, 10, 12, filed in August, 1970, are\npupil locator maps showing Anglo, black and Mexican-American stu-\ndent concentrations throughout the school district. Defendants'\nExhibits 27, 28 and 29, filed in May, 1971, are similar maps,\nbut indicate only black and \"white\" (Mexican-Americans being\ncounted as whites) student concentrations.\n8/ Enrollments for all schools for 1970-71 are shown in\nDef. Ex. 79.(cid:9) J\n- 8 -\n\nB. Historical Student Assignment Policies\nThe defendants have traditionally assigned students\non the basis of attendance zones, 9/ but until 1955 dual\noverlapping zone lines were maintained for all \"white\" and\n\"black\" schools.(cid:9) In 1953-54 nine all-black schools\nwere maintained under this system -- one senior high school,\none junior high school and seven elementary schools. 10/\nThe secondary schools and three of the elementary schools\nwere located in the area of heaviest black concentration\nbetween 19th and 6th Streets. u/\nJ\n10/ For location of these schools, see Def. Ex. 91, p. 43 and\nmap 8). One small elementary school, Montopolis, was located\nin the irregularly shaped strip of land south of the river in\nsoutheast Austin. Three other elementary schools --\nBrackenridge, Clarksville and St. Johns -- were located outside\nof East Austin to serve small black communities. Approximately\n8970 of the district's black secondary students resided in East\nAustin (Gov. Ex. 3-B); the remaining 11% (or approximately 160)\nof the eligible students had to travel to East Austin for junior\nand senior high school.\n11/ The 1947 school survey refers to this area as the \"mother\nzone.\" It points out that if the survey recommendations for new\nschools are followed:\nThe population will desire to live there instead of\nmoving elsewhere, especially the present home owners\nand those with children. In so doing, the School\nBoard will have contributed a valuable service to the\nnon-white population as well as to the people of Austin.\n(Def. Ex. 91, p. 45).\n\nAlthough there was not rigidly-enforced separation\nof Mexican-American students to the degree that blacks were\nseparated, there were some dual overlapping zones between\n\"Mexican\" and Anglo elementary schools. The earliest in-\nformation concerning a \"Mexican\" school relates to the West\nAvenue school located at the corner of West Avenue and Fourth\nStreet, five blocks south of Pease, an Anglo elementary school.\nUnlike all other elementary schools in Austin, the West Avenue\nschool had no gdeeogfriapnheicd 3zo3n1e )(;Ir .instead, it(cid:9) I/\nshared a zone with the Pease school and enrolled a majority of\n12/\nthe Mexican-American students in the school district.\nIn 1924 the defendants built a new elementary school\nat Comal Street and Third Avenue, named the Comal Street School.\nThis school was designated as a \"Mexican\" school, and was built\nto serve the \"large number of non-English speaking students\"\n/ Def't. Ex. 69 indicates that in 1916 West Avenue, a five\nclassroom structure, enrolled 280 Mexican-Americans and no\nAnglos. Pease, a fourteen classroom school, enrolled 631\nAnglos and 40 Mexican-Americans. In addition, there were\nnine other \"white\" elementary schools operated at this time.\nThe scholastic census for 1915-16 indicated that there were\nonly 316 Mexican American students in the entire school dis-\ntrict. (Gov't. Ex. 1) The West Avenue school continued in\noperation as a \"Mexican\" school until 1947.\n- 10 -\n\n13/\nwho attended Palm, Bickler and Metz.(cid:9) At that time these were\nthe only white schools (other than West Avenue) with more than\n20 Mexican-American students.(cid:9) In the late 1920's, the West\nAvenue and Comal Street schools enrolled more than half the\n15/\nMexican-American students attending school in the district.\nBy 1934 the number of Mexican-American students in\nthe Austin elementary schools had increased, particularly\n1U/\nin East Austin.(cid:9) In addition to West Avenue and Comal Street,\nwhich enrolled 470 or about 457. of the Mexican-American\n13/ Gov't.

Ex. 69.\n15/ Complete enrollment data has not been provided, par-\nticularly for the early years. For preparation for trial of\nthis case, the defendants examined microfilm of enrollment\nJ\ncards and counted Spanish surnames for some years.

The facility\nwas converted into an \"opportunity\" school for low-achieving\njunior high school students, and the curriculum became voca-\ntionally oriented. (Def't. Ex. 69; Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes,\n2/ One student who attended Metz in 1941 recalled only five\nor six Mexican-Americans at that school.

Ex. 3-B) The zone line was drawn along Third\nStreet immediately adjacent to the Zavala school. (Gov't. Ex.\n9-B) As a consequence, Zavala remained virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican, while Metz had a predominantly Mexican-American\ncensus in its area. The Anglo enrollment at Metz has further\ndeclined since that time, leaving it virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican today.\n22/ West Avenue enrolled 65 students and Zavala enrolled 726.\n(Gov't. Ex. 4) While there were approximately 1400 eligible\nelementary students, the high dropout rate of Mexican-American\nstudents makes it unlikely that this number was enrolled in\nschool. (See Gov't. Ex. 20)\n- 14 -\n\nAug. 8, 1935)(cid:9) The regular elementary students who had\nattended Bickler were reassigned to nearby schools by\nabolishing the Bickler zone and reapportioning it among\nthe zones for Winn, Palm and Metz (Zavala). Additional\nclassrooms were provided at Winn and Palm to accommodate\nthese children. (Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes, August 8, 1935,\nNovember 14, 1935)\nIn 1939, a committee from the Winn school complained\nto the Board about the Mexican-American pupils who had been\ntransferred to that school from Bickler stating that they\nfelt the Winn school \"should not be asked to take all of\nthese pupils and asked for some relief.\" (Gov't. Ex. 6-F,\n.a/ Bickler was located at 11th and what is now the Inter-\nregional. Both Zavala and Bickler (once it became an oppor-\ntunity school) enrolled a large number of migrant Mexican-\nAmerican students.

Ex. 6-F)\nApparently the upper elementary grades were subse-\nquently reassigned, because by 1947 Bickler housed only grades\none through three in addition to the junior high school special\neducation program. There were 155 primary grade students in\nBickler in 1947 when that facility was closed. It was pro-\nposed that these students be reassigned to Winn and Palm. The\nboard was advised (Gov't. Ex. 6-F, Minutes, July 11, 1947):\n... that the older children in Bickler\nSchool are sub-normal and that the primary\nchildren are all Latin-American. 24 /\n24 / In 1947, before Bickler and West Avenue closed, there\nwere 1,050 students enrolled at Bickler, Zavala and West, the\nthree virtually all Mexican-American schools in the district.\n(Gov't.

The dropout rate was very high and comparatively few\nMexican-American students enrolled in the junior and senior\n25/\nhigh schools.\nC. Student Assignment Policies Since 1954\nBeginning in 1955, after the Brown decision, the school\nboard undertook a program for abolishing the dual overlapping\nzones for black schools. The first phase of this program dealt\nonly with senior high schools (grades 10-12). At that time\nthe district was served by three white high schools and one\nblack high school. Anderson, the black school, served the en-\ntire district. The white high schools were Travis - which\nserved the area south of the Colorado River, Austin - which\nserved the central part of the district including the area in\n25/ Between 1927 and 1943 less than 27. of the high school\ngraduates from Austin were Mexican Americans, at a time when\nthe school census showed that 157 of the student population\nwas Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex. 17) See also Def't. Ex. 69\nwhich shows that in 1933 Austin High, the only non-black high\nschool, had only 18 Spanish surnamed students and that in 1934\nAllan Junior High, in whose zone most Mexican-American students\nresided, had only 70 such students, while these schools enrolled\na total of 2831 Anglo students. (See als\n 1/ -\n\nwhich Anderson was located and McCallum - which served the\nnorthern part of the district. For the 1955-56 school year\nand thereafter, Anderson was given a zone which traced the\nblack residential area in East Austin. (Tr. pp. 341-42)\nThis zone which commenced at the eastern edge of the school\ndistrict was an irregular, elongated zone approximately one\nmile wide from north to south and extended approximately four\nmiles westward into the center of the Austin zone, which\nZL/\nbordered it on three sides.(cid:9) Simultaneously, the school\nboard adopted a free transfer policy which applied only to\nthe Anderson school. Under this policy, the students zoned\ninto Anderson were allowed to transfer out to traditionally\nwhite schools and students living outside the zone were\nallowed to transfer into Anderson. (Gov't. Ex. 7-A, Board\nMinutes, Aug. 8, 1955) This transfer policy was not dis-\ncontinued until 1969. only one white student attended\n26/ See map, Appendix B to this brief.\n- 18 -\n\nY\n27/\nAnderson prior to the 1969-70 school year.+\nDesegregation of grades below the tenth grade progressed\non a grade-a-year basis starting in the 1958-59 school year.\nA zone line for the traditionally black Kealing Junior High\nwas established which was identical to that for Anderson High.\nBlack junior high school students who wished to transfer to\ntraditionally \"white\" schools were limited in their options to\nthe University Junior High or Allan Junior High depending on\nwhere in the Kealing zone the transferring student resided.\nBy this time the enrollment at Allan was predominantly Mexican-\nAmerican. Like the high school level, free transfer into\nv/ School census figures for 1955-56 (Gov't. Ex. 3-C) show\nthat approximately 71 Anglo and 27 Mexican-American high school\nage students resided in the Winn Elementary zone, which for the\nmost part was within the Anderson zone. One hundred and four\nAnglo and 99 Mexican-American high school age children resided\nin the Govalle Elementary zone, part of which was in the\nAnderson zone. Yet only one white child attended Anderson\nbetween 1955 and 1969 (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information\non Integration) At the same time black students from outside\nEast Austin transferred to Anderson. For example, in 1955-56\nthere were 63 black high school students in the St. Johns\nElementary area, located in the McCallum High School zone.\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-C) The first year there is any record of a\nNegro attending McCallum is 1969-70 when there was one Negro\nout of a total enrollment of 1928. (Gov't. Ex. 2)\n- 19 -\n\nf\ni\n^a\ni\nKealing was permitted, and this policy was not discontinued(cid:9) I'\n28/\nuntil 1969.(cid:9) Kealing, like Anderson, has remained virtually\nall black. (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information).\nElementary students first began desegregating in 1961\nwith the sixth grade, and by 1963 students in all six ele-\nmentary grades were allowed to attend formerly all-white schools\nin their zone. (Gov't. Ex. 7-B, Minutes, July 10, 1961) In\n1964 the defendants still maintained two sets of maps of zone\nlines, one for formerly white schools and one for formerly\n(cid:9)\nblack schools. (Gov't. Ex. 9-C and 9-D) Black stu-\ndents from Sims could only transfer to Ortega, which by 1967-68\nwas 50% black, 457 Mexican-American and 57 Anglo; di-\nrectly north of Sims was Pecan Springs (897.

Under this policy\nblacks from outside the Kealing zone continued to transfer to\nKealing. For example, Pearce Junior High opened in 1958 with\nan enrollment of 295 Anglos and 3 Mexican Americans. Black\njunior high students from the St. Johns community continued to\ntransfer to Kealing under the transfer policy even though the\nSt. Johns area was within the Pearce zone.\n- 20 -\n\nI\n(96% Mexican-American in 1967-68), Metz (98% Mexican-American)\nor Zavala (96% Mexican-American) while Pease Elementary, di-\nrectly east of Blackshear, was 857.

In 1961, when blacks first began to transfer, Winn\nhad 161 Anglo and 96 Mexican-American elementary students. By\n1967-68 Winn was 63% black and 28% Mexican American. A new\nWinn opened in extreme northeast Austin in 1970-71 with a 947.\nAnglo enrollment.\n30/ See Gov't. Ex. 9-E. In addition between 1961 and 1965\nthree small black schools (approximately 60-65 students) were\nclosed: Montopolis (1961); Brakenridge (1965); Clarksville\n(1965). When Montopolis was closed its students were sent\nacross the Colorado River to the all-black Sims Elementary\nuntil all grades were allowed to integrate, when they were\nassigned to the predominantly Mexican American Allison Ele-\nmentary School. (Gov't. Ex. 3-D shows that in 1963-64, 455\nMexican American and 114 Anglo elementary students resided in\nthis area.) Brackenridge students were reassigned to Becker\nElementary, also predominantly Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex.\n3-E shows 426 Mexican-Americans and 298 Anglos in this area\nin 1965-66.) Clarksville students were reassigned to Mathews\nElementary (411 Anglos and 137 Mexican Americans in 1965-66).\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-E)\n- 21 -\n\nNot until 1969-70 were black elementary students given free\nchoice to attend any school in the district. (Gov't. Ex.\n7-H, Minutes, July 14, 1969) Nonetheless, the elementary\nzone map of today shows that four of the six black schools\nin East Austin still have zones which overlap with one or\n31/\nmore Mexican-American schools. (Def' t. Ex. 11)^\nD. Construction Policy Since 1950\nAfter World War II the AISD was faced with a shortage\nof school capacity, due to the increased student population\nand the absence of any construction in the district since\n1940. In 1950 it embarked on a continuous construction pro-\ngram which has resulted in the opening of 36 new elementary,\n32/\n9 new junior high and 7 new high schools. (Def't. Ex. 13)\n31/ Campbell's zone had overlapped with Winn; with the closing\nof Winn in 1969, Campbell now has its own zone. Norman, which\nopened in 1970 east of Sims, also has its own zone.\n32/ In 1950, 89% of the district's Mexican American student\npopulation and 937 of the blacks lived in East Austin.\n- 22 -\n\n2\nIn picking the sites for these schools, the defendants\nconsider capacity and neighborhood need, and claim that race\nand ethnic origin are not taken into account. (Tr. pp. 453-\n54) However, one of the major uses of the census material\nkept by the district is to study trends and projections of\npopulation concentration, growth and movement for purposes\nof planning a building program. (Tr._.329.-.3 Q) The census\nhas traditionally enumerated the number of black students\nin the district, and in 1948 and thereafter, the census\nfigures divided the \"white\" students into \"Anglo-American\"\nand \"Latin-American\" student categories.\nMuch of this construction interacted with changes in\nstudent assignment policies adopted following the Brown de-\ncision in 1954. On the high school level, only one \"white\"\nhigh school (Austin) was operated until 1953. In that year two\nhigh schools -- McCallum in North Austin and Travis in South\nAustin -- opened; Austin High then served all white students\na/See Ir Z2-28; Gov't Exs. 2, 3.(cid:9) This was one year after\nthe Gubbels' Report (Def.

Ex. 13)\nIn 1970-71 St. Johns housed 162 students (153 of whom were\nblack), while Brown, Harris and Andrews each housed over 400\nstudents and remained overwhelmingly Anglo. (See Def.

(Def. Ex. 77, 78, 80; Tr. 930-33)\nFollowing the June 28, 1971 order, modifications were made to\nthe secondary plan.

(Memorandum Opinion and Order, July 19, 1971, p. 11)\n2. Elementary Schools\nThe defendants' plan as approved by the district\ncourt assigns all students initially by the same\nzone lines that were maintained in 1970-71, except for the St.\nJohns school, and which will result in approximately the\nsame degree of racial and ethnic separation that existed\n58/\nin 1970-71.(cid:9) In addition, the plan has organized six clusters\n.U/ \nThe defendants submitted projected zone lines for these\nschools (Def. Ex. 31, 32, 33) which would actually decrease de-\nsegregation. Blacks who will be non-contiguously zoned to three\nhigh schools and five junior high schools are rezoned to Johnston,\nAllan and Martin. Under this rezoning 3 high schools and 7 junior\nhigh schools would be 97% Anglo (Def. Ex. 33); at the same time\nthe black enrollments at the Johnston, Allan and Martin schools\n(which are already over 90% minority group) would be increased.\n(See also Tr. 906-13)\n58/ See Def. Ex. 11. In 1970-71, 81% of the black elementary\nstudents and 60% of the Mexican-American elementary students\nattended schools that were over 90% minority. In 1971-72 St.\nJohns (94% black) will be closed and its students reassigned to\nBrown (78% Anglo) and Harris (93% Anglo). (Report and Submis-\nsion, July 15, 1971; Order, September 4, 1970). Overlapping zone\nlines for black and predominantly Mexican-American schools in East\nAustin will apparently continue.\n- 35 -\n\nof schools which include 40 schools and approximately 22,000\nstudents. Each cluster includes two or three minority schools\n(at least one of which is predominantly black and one\npredominantly Mexican-American) and four or five predominantly\nMexican-American) and four or five predominantly Anglo schools.\n(Def. Ex. 78)\nIntegrated activities for the students in each cluster\nwill be scheduled every fourth week. These activities will\nconsist of (1) visits to \"learning resource centers\" which\nwill be established at the former black secondary schools\nwhich have been closed (Anderson and Kealing) and at a\nclosed elementary school (Baker); (2) inter-site visits in\nwhich students of grade level will meet at one of the\nschools in the cluster; and (3) field trips involving all\nstudents from a cluster. These integrated activities will\ncover four curriculum areas -- fine arts, social studies,\nsciences and vocational courses. During the integrated\nactivities students will be assigned to small instructional\ngroups of 6-8 students and will include black, Anglo and\nMexican-American students. Basic subject areas such as\nreading and mathematics will continue to be taught only in\nthe school of original assignment. (See Def.

(Tr. 944)\n- 37 -\n\nDISCUSSION\nIntroduction\nThis case raises difficult questions which, because\nof their importance, we feel obliged to present to this\nCourt. What is the relief required by Swann v. Board of\nEducation, 402 U.S. 1 as to the eradication of Austin's old\ndual system of segregation of white from black? What facts\nestablish a case of illegal discrimination in assignment of\nMexican-American and Anglo students in the white part of the\ndual system? If there has been an illegal separation of\nMexican American from Anglo as well as black from white,\nwhat is the appropriate remedy?\nAppellate review of the case is rendered difficult\nby a combination of circumstances. In spite of the lengthy\nrecord and the specificity of the proof (largely based upon\nofficial records rather than witness testimony) the district\ncourt did not make specific findings of fact but instead\nmade general recitations mixing findings of ultimate fact\nwith conclusions of law. Because of this it is often not\npossible to tell what legal standards were followed in assessing\n- 38 -\n\nthe facts or even which alleged facts were accepted as true\nand which were rejected as false. Second, the district\ncourt had before it remedies which it apparently judged\ninappropriate; therefore, it initially declined to order\neither the board plan or the HEW plan into effect. Ulti-\nmately the court elected to order into effect one inappro-\npriate remedy rather than the other. It seems clear to us\nthat a new remedy must be fashioned, but that cannot be\ndone until the nature and extent of discrimination against\nMexican-Americans has been determined.\nI. MEXICAN-AMERICANS AS A RACIAL OR ETHNIC CLASS\nUNDER BROWN\nThe district court was clearly correct in\nfinding that Mexican-Americans are a separate ethnic\nminority in Austin and thus a group entitled to the equal pro-\ntection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hernandez v.\nTexas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954); Alvarado v. El Paso Independent School\nDistrict, No. 71-1555 (5th Cir., decided June 16, 1971);\n- 39 -\n\ncf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Yick\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886). This finding\nwas made on the basis of many of these decisions, on the\ndefendants' appointment of a tri-ethnic committee, on\ntestimony of the defendants' Superintendent, and \"by even\nthe most casual examination of Mexican-American culture.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p.2) In\naddition, the AISD's historical maintenance of \"Mexican\"\nschools, their enumeration of Mexican-Americans in compiling\n61l Many earlier decisions have established this principle\nin school desegregation cases. Independent School District\nv. Salvatierra, 33 S.W. 2d 790 (Tex. Civ. App., 1930), cert.\nden., 284 U.S. 580 (1931); Mendez v. Westminster School District,\n64 F. Supp. 544 (S.D.

Presently pending on appeal before this Court are\ntwo other cases which have made the same finding. Cisneros\nand United States v. Corpus Christi Independent School District,\n324 F. Supp. 599 (S.D. Tex. 1970) (No. 71-2367 on appeal);\nTasby v. Estes, C. A. No. 3-4211-C (N.D. Tex., July 16, 1971)\n(No. 71-2581 on appeal). And see Mr. Justice Douglas' comments\nin denying a stay for Chinese students of a school desegregation\norder in San Francisco: \"Brown v. Board of Education was not\nwritten for Blacks alone ... The theme of our school desegre-\ngation cases extends to all racial minorities treated invidiously\nby a State or any of its agencies.\" Lee v. Johnson, No. A-203\n(Douglas, Circuit Justice, August 25, 1971).\n- 40 -\n\n9\ncensus statistics, and their more recent recognition of\ncitizens' groups representing the Mexican-American community\n62 /\nreinforce this finding.\nII. PRE-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nAs the district court noted, prior to 1955 the de-\nfendants \"maintained a dual school system with educational\nopportunities separate and inherently unequal for blacks.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 3) This\nsystem was characterized by overlapping attendance zones\nand complete segregation of black students and black faculty\nat all grade levels in the system. The defendant school\ndistrict thus fell squarely within the command of Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), 349 U.S. 294 (1955),\nand was under an affirmative duty to eliminate \"all vestiges\nof state-imposed segregation.\" Swann v. Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).\nWe start from the fact that neither the State of\nTexas nor the defendants have ever officially required the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in schools. There\n62' Gov't. Ex. 3; 6-J, 6-K.\n- 41 -\n\nis evidence, however, that some of the pre-Brown practices\nand policies with regard to Mexican-Americans in Austin\nwere similar to the discriminatory student assignment\npolicies traditionally applied to black students.\nThe district court noted the pre-Brown existence of\nsome schools designated as \"Mexican\" schools, with all\nMexican-American enrollments and attendance zones which\noverlapped with predominantly Anglo schools, but it none-\ntheless found that these schools were not \"built for the\npurpose of discriminating against, isolating or segregating\nstudents on the basis of Mexican-American ethnic origin.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, fn. 12(c))\nfinding \nWe think this  is erroneous in view of the court's\nown finding, and the record in this case. The evidence\nshows that the defendants created and maintained, at various\ntimes prior to 1954, three such schools in the system with\n63/\nzones overlapping Anglo school zones.(cid:9) The creation and\nmaintenance of overlapping or \"optional\" attendance zones\n63/ These were the West Avenue School, the Comal Street School,\nand the Zavala School, which replaced the Comal Street School\nwhen it opened in 1936. The Zavala School was built to meet\nthe need of the Mexican-American population \"as near the center\nof this population as possible,\" and parts of the school curri-\nculum were designed for junior high age Mexican-American migrant\nstudents who were still attending elementary school. See pp.10-14.\nsupra.\n- 42 -\n\n0\nis constitutional only if it does not encourage or preserve\nsegregation. See Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683,\n686 (1963); Monroe v. Board of School Commissioners, 391 U.S.\n450, 458-59 (1968); Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401,\n415-17 (D.D.C. 1967); aff'd sub nom Smuck v. Hobson, 408\nF.2d 175, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1969). In addition, the court\noverlooked uncontroverted evidence showing the discriminatory\nassignment of Mexican-American elementary students to the\nBickler school in 1939 after Anglo parents had objected\nto the assignment of these students to the predominantly\n64/\nAnglo Winn school.\nFinally, the court ignored uncontroverted evidence\nthat when the dual zone for Zavala and Metz was eliminated\nin 1954, the new zone line was drawn on Third Street, immediately\nadjacent to the Zavala school, with the result that Zavala\nremained virtually all Mexican-American. Discrimination in\nthe drawing of zone lines in a school system purportedly\nfit/ \nBy 1947 all elementary age students at Bickler were\nMexican-American. During this same period, the school board\nfailed to act on a request of the Mexican consul in 1944 to\neliminate the segregation situation at the Zavala and Metz\nschools. See pp. 15-16 , supra.\n- 43 -\n\nfollowing a neighborhood school policy has been held un-\nlawful. See,., Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate\nSchool System, 409 F.2d 682 (5th Cir. 1969); United States v.\nSchool District 151, 404 F.2d ll25 j7th_Cir.1968); United States v.\nBoard of Education, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 429 F.2d 1253 (10th Cir.1970).\nIII. POST-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nThe district court found that defendants have not\ndiscriminated against black or Mexican-American students\nsince Brown II. As to blacks, the court ruled that relief\nwas required to eradicate the vestiges of the pre-1955 dual\nsystem. For that reason, on appellate review the main\nissue is whether the district court's holding as to Mexican-\nAmericans was correct.\nWe would agree that the record might support a\nfinding that defendants did not engage in a purposeful\nsystematic program intended to discriminate against all\n5/ Nonetheless, we think the record requires reversal of\nthe finding that defendants have not discriminated against\nblacks since 1955. Such a finding is inconsistent with the\ncontinued maintenance of dual, overlapping zones, the building\nof the under-sized all-black St. Johns school surrounded by\nthree white schools, the selection of other elementary school\nsites in areas where the new schools constructed would be\nall-black, the construction of additions to predominantly\none-race schools adjacent to schools serving opposite race\nstudents, the continuation of faculty segregation, and the\ndrawing of secondary school attendance zone lines intended\nto segregate.\n- 44 -\n\nMexican-American students. Indeed, as to some predominantly\nMexican-American schools there is no proof of discrimination.\nBut the district court failed to find specific facts as\nto the cause of the undoubted isolation of minority group\nstudents in most of East Austin, in spite of a voluminous\nrecord demonstrating that defendants knew their actions\nwould further separate Mexican-American students from Anglo\nstudents.\nIn the years immediately before and after Brown,\ndefendants took the following actions which increased the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in East Austin:\n(a) The construction of three secondary\nschools attended predominantly by Mexican-\nAmerican students and simultaneous abandonment\nof two centrally-located secondary schools\nin which Anglo and Mexican-American students would\nhave remained integrated.\n(b) In some instances the drawing of zone\nlines and creation of optional zones to minimize\nthe number of Anglo students in minority group\nschools and the number of minority group students\nin Anglo schools. The most notable example is\nthe Martin Junior High School zone.\nSuch evidence would not, of itself, establish discrimination.\nIf the defendants lumped Anglo and Mexican-American students\ntogether for all purposes as \"white\" students, the evidence\n- 45 -\n\nwould merely reflect that some white schools were built in\nEast Austin and some in other parts of Austin. But the\nevidence shows that defendants considered the Mexican-\nAmericans a separate ethnic group, and the inference\ntherefore could be made that some construction and zone\ndrawing were affected by the distinction. In 1948,\nafter the Mexican-American student population had grown and\n66/\nthe Mexican-American drop-out rate had begun its decline,\nthe defendants changed their student census from an\nenumeration of blacks and whites to an enumeration of\nblacks, Anglos, and Mexican-Americans.(cid:9) Since school\nconstruction needs and zone line changes were projected\nlargely on the basis of the census data, this change in\n66/ In 1933-34 only 3% of the \"white\" secondary students were\nMexican-American; in 1970-71 this number had increased to 20%.\nThe number of Mexican-American secondary students likewise\nincreased from 88 to 4286 in the same period. (See Def. Exs.\n69,79)\n67/ This change in administrative practice occurred in 1948,\nalmost simultaneously with the completion of a twenty-year\nprojection of school construction plans which has guided much\nof defendants' construction activities since 1950. See Def.\nEx. 91 (The Gubbels' Report), and p. 23, -supra.(cid:9) The\nenumeration of \"Latin-Americans\" was, according to the testimony,\nbegun as a \"research project\" and continued because it was\n\"very interesting and revealing.\" (Tr. pp. 327-28)\n- 46 -\n\noperation provided the means for considering the ethnic\nimpact of construction and zone drawing decisions. Cf.\nAvery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 562 (1953); Whitus v. Georgia,\n385 U.S. 545, 552 (1967). Further, defendants admittedly\ntook race and ethnic origin into account in drawing certain\nof the zone lines during this period. Compare the rationale\nfor separating blacks and Mexican-Americans on the high\nschool level (\"insecurity and competition economically\n68/\namong the ... 'Negro' and 'Latin-American'...'')(cid:9) with\nthe rationale for gerrymandering black students into Martin\n[and presumably Allan] Junior High Schools instead of the\nnearer, predominantly Anglo Baker Junior High (integrating\n69 /\n\"white\" and black students). And when defendants set up\noptional zones so blacks could transfer to \"white\" schools,\nin almost every instance the school was virtually all\n68/ Tr. pp. 341-45; Gov. Ex. 7-E.\n69/ Tr. p. 382. See appendix A-4 and C. Where inconsistent\ngrounds for school board action are given or stated grounds\nare inconsistently applied, an inference of discrimination\nis raised. Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,\n443 F.2d 573, 576 (6th Cir. 1971).\n- 47 -\n\nMexican-American. Cf. Ross v. Eckels, 434 F.2d 1140, 1150\n70/\n(5th Cir. 1970) (Clark, J. dissenting).\nThe task of this Court, then, is to assess the probative\neffect of these inferences on the outcome of this appeal; or,\nin the alternative, to remand for further hearing and findings\nby the district court.\nIn finding no de jure discrimination, the court below\napparently referred only to the testimony adduced below, and\nignored the voluminous documentary evidence introduced into\nthe record. The law is well-settled that inferences of dis-\ncrimination may be drawn from such documentary evidence,\nand they may be conclusive despite testimony of racial\nneutrality by responsible officials. See, e.g., Hernandez\nv. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 481-82 (1954); Turner v. Fouche,\n396 U.S. 346, 360-61 (1970), and cases cited therein in notes\n20-22; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 598 (1935); Keyes v.\n70/ In considering possible remedies, the district court\nstated that the \"burden\" of desegregation of blacks should not\nbe placed solely on Mexican-Americans, and announced that this\nshould be a consideration in preparing desegregation plans.\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 6)\n- 48 -\n\nSchool District No. 1, 303 F. Supp. 279, 313 F. Supp. 61\n(D. Colo. 1969), aff'd(cid:9) - F. 2d(cid:9) (No. 336-70, decided\nJune 11, 1971); Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; United States v. School District 151, supra.\nThe impact of these and other inferences should be\nconsidered and decided by this Court, especially should\nit decide to remand for further proceedings below. Some\nof the questions discussed herein as well as other related\n11/\nissues, have been considered by Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nbut they are generally questions of first impression for this\nCourt. Therefore, we think it appropriate for this Court\nto consider the need for specific criteria of evidentiary\nanalysis to be applied by district courts facing these\nsituations. The need for such criteria is emphasized by a\ncomparison of the decision of the court below in this case\nwith the decision of the district court in Cisneros v.\nCorpus Christi Independent School District, 324 F. Supp. 599\n121\n(S.D. Texas 1970), which is also on appeal to this Court.\nj1 \t e.g., \nDavis v. School Board of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; Keyes v. School District No. 1, supra; United States\nV. School District 151, supra; Taylor v. Boarder Education,\n294 F. 2d 36 (2nd Cir. 1969).\nj/ Appeal No. 71-2397.\n- 49 -\n\nAlthough district courts sit as courts of equity in these\ncases, with broad powers, some degree of detail and\nspecificity is necessary to evaluate the evidence of\ndiscrimination, just as some guidelines are necessary for\na determination of questions of relief. Cf. Swann v.\nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 6, 26 (1971).\nIV. THE RELIEF\nIn fashioning relief for this case, the district\ncourt had before it two desegregation plans drawn and\nsubmitted prior to the presentation of the facts at trial\nconcerning the nature and extent of discrimination within\nthe Austin School System. The HEW plan, which was prepared\nin response to the district court order of September 4, 1970\nto make a comprehensive study and prepare a plan \"which will\ncompletely disestablish a dual school system,\" was based\non the assumption that de 'lure discrimination against both\nblacks and Mexican-Americans existed system-wide; consequently,\nit was drawn to eliminate the ethnic and racial identifiability\nof every school in the system. It also adopted on a full-time\nbasis the cluster system for elementary schools which defen-\ndants had adopted on a part-time basis. The plan submitted\n- 50 -\n\nby the defendants apparently assumed that no de jure dis-\n73 /\ncrimination had ever been practiced against Mexican-Americans,\nand that only vestiges of the dual school system which had\nbeen maintained for blacks prior to 1955 remained.\nThe district court's June 28, 1971 opinion found that\nthe evidence in the case supported defendants' assumption\nand accordingly its subsequent remedial order of July 19,\n1971 approved the defendants' plan. We agree that the scope\nof the remedy ordered in cases of this kind ought to be\nconsistent with the nature of the violation. But here the\ndistrict court's findings as to the quantum of officially-\nimposed discrimination are erroneous both as to blacks and\nMexican-Americans. Since it now appears that the evidence\nas to de jure discrimination against Mexican-Americans does\nnot extend to all Mexican-American schools as assumed by the\nHEW plan, a remand to the district court to consider the ex-\ntent of the relief warranted in this case appears proper. The\nfollowing discussion is submitted for the Court's considera-\ntion as to the direction that such an inquiry might take.\n73/ Defendants' plan did include Mexican-American schools in\nits elementary desegregation plan; it did so for educational\npurposes, not as a matter of constitutional duty. Tr. pp.799-800.\n- 51 -\n\nA. BLACK SCHOOLS\nThe facts in this case establish a formerly state-\nimposed dual school system which was never disestablished.\nWhile the district court plan eliminates all secondary schools\nidentifiable as black schools, the elementary school plan\ninitially assigns black students to schools in the same\nmanner as during 1970-71 (which still include some dual over-\nlapping zones with predominantly Mexican-American schools).\n74/\nPart-time desegregation is provided for 16% of the time.\nWhile this may have much to commend it educationally, standing\nalone it does not eradicate the dual system. See Bivins v.\nBibb County Board of Education, 424 F.2d 97 (5th Cir. 1970).\nThe district court distinguishes this case from Bibb on\nits facts, stating that the defendants' plan \"encompasses\nvirtually all of the system's Anglo elementary students\nfor a much larger portion of their academic time in a\nfar wider and more meaningful range of multi-cultural ex-\nperiences.\" (Memorandum Opinion and Order, July 19, 1971,\n74 / Computed by multiplying the percent of school days (25%)\nspent in integrated classes by the percent of each such day\nin such classes (4-1/2 of each 7 hours; or 64%).\n- 52 -\n\np. 8) Yet, the initial discriminatory assignment of students\nunder this plan will govern at least 8 of their learning\n141. \nexperience. In the context of this case where each black\nschool in the system was created and has been maintained at\nall times as an all-black school, such a P' lan can hardly be\nsaid to meet the school board's duty to take 'whatever steps\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination is eliminated root and branch.\" Green\nv. New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968). On remand\nthe district court should consider other approaches to desegre-\ngating the black elementary schools.\nB. MEXICAN-ANERICAN \nSCHOOLS\nThe evidence in this case reveals that the nature of\nthe defendants' constitutional violation with regards to\nMexican-Americans does not permeate the entire school system.\nTherefore, the Court should decide at which schools there\nis proof of discrimination and should limit its relief to\neradicating the effects of that discrimination.\n- 53 -\n\nC ONC LUS ION\nFor the above reasons, the case should be reversed\nand remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWILLIAM SESSIONS(cid:9) DAVID L.

Procedural History\nThis school desegregation case was filed by the United\nStates pursuant to Section 407(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a) and (b), on August 7, 1970\nagainst the Texas Education Agency and seven independent\nschool districts, including the Austin Independent School\nDistrict (hereinafter, the defendants or the AISD), located in the\nWestern District of Texas. The complaint alleged that these\nschool districts had traditionally operated dual school sys-\ntems based on race and that their present student and faculty\nassignment policies had failed to eliminate all vestiges of\nthese dual systems. In addition, it was alleged that three\nof the local districts, including the AISD, were discrimina-\ntorily assigning Mexican-American students to schools identi-\nfiable as Mexican-American schools or as schools intended for\n1.J\nonly black and Mexican-American students.\n1/ After this complaint was filed, a motion to intervene as\nplaintiff and complaint in intervention were filed on behalf\nof Mexican-American students. This motion was denied by the\ncourt on August 24, 1970. Subsequently, in February, 1971 a\nseparate action was brought on behalf of the Mexican-Americans\nagainst the AISD. On June 10, 1971 the court denied the motion\nof plaintiffs in that case for consolidation and joint hearing\nof that case with this action.\n-2 -\n\nOn August 7, 1970 the district court issued an order\nrequiring the defendants, among others, to formulate and submit a\ndesegregation plan to the Texas Education Agency and repre-\nsentatives of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\n(hereinafter HEW). If no agreement was reached between the\nparties as to an acceptable plan, the defendant school dis-\ntricts and HEW were to file respective plans with the court.\nA hearing concerning the plans developed for the defendants was held\non August 27, 1970 at which the United States submitted an\ninterim desegregation plan prepared by HEW. After the hearing\nthe district court orally ordered that this interim plan be\nimplemented immediately. On September 4, 1970 the district\ncourt amended the oral order in a written order requiring\nimmediate implementation of the standard provisions of Single-\nton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School System, 419 F. 2d\n1211 (5th Cir. 1969) pertaining to faculty and staff, con-\nstruction, transportation, majority-to-minority transfer pro-\nvisions and attendance outside the system. In addition, HEW\nwas ordered to conduct a comprehensive study of the Austin School\nDistrict and prepare a plan to completely desegregate all schools in\n\n2/\nthe district.(cid:9) Following court orders of December 15, 1970,\nIF.\nFebruary 26, 1971, April 14, 1971 and May 7, 1971 extending\nthe date for filing plans, the parties filed desegregation\n3/\nplans with the district court on May 14, 1971.\nA six day trial on the merits was held June 14 through\nJune 21, 1971. On June 28, 1971 the district court entered\na memorandum opinion and order which found that, while Mexican-\nAmericans constituted a separate ethnic minority in Austin, no\nde jure discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin\nhad been practiced against Mexican-Americans in the operation\nof the AISD. As to blacks, the court found that vestiges of\nthe dual school system based on race still existed. The court\nordered the parties to renegotiate in an effort to reach agree-\nment on a common plan based on these findings and upon certain\nguidelines contained in the order.\n2/ Defendants' Officials were ordered to consult and cooperate\nwith HEW in preparation of the plan; if the parties were able\nto agree upon a plan, it was to be submitted to the court by\n15, \nDecember  1970, and if the parties failed to agree, separate\nplans were to be filed by the parties.\n3/ Defendants' plan as filed on May 14, 1971 is contained\nin Defendants Exhibits 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. The\nplan was updated and modified slightly at trial. (See Def. Ex.\n77, 78 and 80; Tr. 930-933.) The HEW plan was filed in the\nform of a letter to Dr. Jack Davidson commenting on  defendants'\nproposal and making further recommendations.\n\nThe parties jointly reported to the district court on\nJuly 15, 1971 that although agreement had been reached on de-\nfendants' high school plan, 4/ disagreements still existed\nconcerning the junior high and elementary school plans. On\nJuly 19, 1971 the district court entered another memorandum\nopinion and order approving the defendants' desegregation plan,\nand notice of appeal from both the June 28 and July 19, 1971\nmemorandum opinions and orders was filed by the United States\non August 3, 1971.\n2. Decision of the Court Below on Discrimination\nIn its June 28, 1971, Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nthe district court specifically found that Mexican-Americans\nconstitute a separate ethnic group in Austin. However, the\ncourt held that there has been no de jure discrimination\nagainst Mexican-Americans, based on its findings of fact set\nout as follows:\n4/ Agreement upon the high school plan was based upon the\ncourt's finding of June 28, 1971 and it was stated that nothing\nin this report was to be read to indicate agreement with those\nfindings by both parties.\n- 5 -\n\n(a) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever adopted, published or promulgated any\nwritten or unwritten rules, regulation or\npolicies having as their purpose the dis-\ncrimination against, or segregation or iso-\nlation of, Mexican Americans.\n(b) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever discriminated against, or attempted to\ndiscriminate against, isolate or segregate\nMexican Americans in any form whatsoever,\nparticularly in:\n(1) site location of schools;\n(2) school construction;\n(3) drawing of school attendance zones;\n(4) student assignments;\n(5) faculty assignments;\n(6) staff assignments;\n(7) faculty and staff employment;\n(8) extracurricular activities; and\n(9) transportation.\n(c) The Zavala and West Elementary Schools were not\nbuilt for the purpose of discriminating against,\nisolating or segregating students on the basis\nof Mexican American ethnic origin. 5/\nThe court also found that vestiges of the previous dual\nsystem with respect to black students still exist. Because of\nthe general nature of the court's findings on the question of\ndiscrimination, we will set out the facts in this area in some\ndetail.\n5/ Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 2 and\nfootnote 12. Despite finding no de jure segregation against\nMexican-Americans, the court stated it would \"consider the\neffect\" upon Mexican-Americans of any plan submitted by the\nparties. Id, p. 6.\n- 6 -\n\n3. Facts\nA. School District Demography\nThe AISD encompasses the City of Austin and some\nterritory outside the city limits, extending approximately\n30 miles north and south and about 25 miles east and west,\nwith a total area of 230 square miles. During the 1970-71\nschool year a total of 35,496 (657.) Anglo students, 11,194\n(20%) Mexican American students and 8,284 (1570) black\nstudents were enrolled in 74 schools in the district. (Def.\nEx. 79) .\nThe black and Mexican-American populations are con-\ncentrated largely in a region known as East Austin, an area\nbounded roughly by an interstate highway and downtown Austin\non the west, 19th Street and the municipal airport on the\nnorth, the Colorado River (and old Colorado school district)\n6/\non the south, and the school district line on the east. The\nblack population is generally concentrated in the northern\nsector of this area, while the Mexican-American population\n6/ The vast majority of the city's low income families are\namong the minority 35 percent of the population and are con-\ncentrated in the eastern part of the city. (Def. Ex. 42, p. 9).\n- 7 -\n\n7 /\nresides primarily in the southern sector. (See Appendix C to Brief) I+.\nA total of eighteen schools, all of which are over 907. minority,(cid:9) I'\nare located in this area; eight of these schools are over 95%\n(cid:9)\nblack, four are over 957 Mexican-American, and six are over\nICY\n90. Mexican-American and black. Approximately 77% of the dis-\ntrict's black students and 597. of the district's Mexican-\n8/\nAmerican students attended these schools in 1970-71.^\nOutside of East Austin the population is primarily Anglo,\nbut there are three schools with a minority enrollment of over\n70%. There is a small black community in the north central por-\ntion of the district served by the St. Johns Elementary School\n(987. minority in 1970-71); a concentration of Mexican-Americans\nsouth of the river and west of the interstate served by the\nBecker Elementary School (75% minority in 1970-71); and a pre-\ndominantly minority area directly north of East Austin between\nthe airport and the interstate, served by the Maplewood Ele-\nmentary School (707. minority in 1970-71). Prior to the 1969-70\nschool year this was a white Anglo school.\n7/ Defendants' Exhibits 5, 10, 12, filed in August, 1970, are\npupil locator maps showing Anglo, black and Mexican-American stu-\ndent concentrations throughout the school district. Defendants'\nExhibits 27, 28 and 29, filed in May, 1971, are similar maps,\nbut indicate only black and \"white\" (Mexican-Americans being\ncounted as whites) student concentrations.\n8/ Enrollments for all schools for 1970-71 are shown in\nDef. Ex. 79.(cid:9) J\n- 8 -\n\nB. Historical Student Assignment Policies\nThe defendants have traditionally assigned students\non the basis of attendance zones, 9/ but until 1955 dual\noverlapping zone lines were maintained for all \"white\" and\n\"black\" schools.(cid:9) In 1953-54 nine all-black schools\nwere maintained under this system -- one senior high school,\none junior high school and seven elementary schools. 10/\nThe secondary schools and three of the elementary schools\nwere located in the area of heaviest black concentration\nbetween 19th and 6th Streets. u/\nJ\n10/ For location of these schools, see Def. Ex. 91, p. 43 and\nmap 8). One small elementary school, Montopolis, was located\nin the irregularly shaped strip of land south of the river in\nsoutheast Austin. Three other elementary schools --\nBrackenridge, Clarksville and St. Johns -- were located outside\nof East Austin to serve small black communities. Approximately\n8970 of the district's black secondary students resided in East\nAustin (Gov. Ex. 3-B); the remaining 11% (or approximately 160)\nof the eligible students had to travel to East Austin for junior\nand senior high school.\n11/ The 1947 school survey refers to this area as the \"mother\nzone.\" It points out that if the survey recommendations for new\nschools are followed:\nThe population will desire to live there instead of\nmoving elsewhere, especially the present home owners\nand those with children.

Three blocks south of this new\nli/\n\"Mexican\" school(cid:9) was the Metz school, which served the Anglo\nchildren in this area. Defendants drew one zone line encompassing\nthe two schools, and Mexican-American students who lived in this\nzone were encouraged and, in some cases, directed by the princi-\n20 /\npal of Metz to attend Zavala;(cid:9) Anglo children who lived across\nthe street from Zavala nonetheless attended Metz, and Mexican-\nAmericans living nearer to Metz traveled past Metz to go to Zavala.\nUnder this arrangement Zavala enrolled all Mexican-Americans and\nMetz was virtually all Anglo.

The facility\nwas converted into an \"opportunity\" school for low-achieving\njunior high school students, and the curriculum became voca-\ntionally oriented. (Def't. Ex. 69; Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes,\n2/ One student who attended Metz in 1941 recalled only five\nor six Mexican-Americans at that school. (Tr. 49) Mexican-\nAmericans complained about this situation in 1944, requesting\nthe Board to require Anglos to attend Zavala, but no action\nwas taken. (Gov't. Ex. 6-H, Minutes, April 10, 1944, July 11,\n1944; Gov't.

Ex. 3-B) The zone line was drawn along Third\nStreet immediately adjacent to the Zavala school. (Gov't. Ex.\n9-B) As a consequence, Zavala remained virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican, while Metz had a predominantly Mexican-American\ncensus in its area. The Anglo enrollment at Metz has further\ndeclined since that time, leaving it virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican today.\n22/ West Avenue enrolled 65 students and Zavala enrolled 726.\n(Gov't. Ex. 4) While there were approximately 1400 eligible\nelementary students, the high dropout rate of Mexican-American\nstudents makes it unlikely that this number was enrolled in\nschool. (See Gov't. Ex. 20)\n- 14 -\n\nAug. 8, 1935)(cid:9) The regular elementary students who had\nattended Bickler were reassigned to nearby schools by\nabolishing the Bickler zone and reapportioning it among\nthe zones for Winn, Palm and Metz (Zavala). Additional\nclassrooms were provided at Winn and Palm to accommodate\nthese children. (Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes, August 8, 1935,\nNovember 14, 1935)\nIn 1939, a committee from the Winn school complained\nto the Board about the Mexican-American pupils who had been\ntransferred to that school from Bickler stating that they\nfelt the Winn school \"should not be asked to take all of\nthese pupils and asked for some relief.\" (Gov't. Ex. 6-F,\n.a/ Bickler was located at 11th and what is now the Inter-\nregional. Both Zavala and Bickler (once it became an oppor-\ntunity school) enrolled a large number of migrant Mexican-\nAmerican students. Because many of the students at Zavala\nwere older than regular elementary students (Gov't.  Ex. 20)\ncertain physical education and homemaking courses were offered\nto these students.

Ex. 6-F)\nApparently the upper elementary grades were subse-\nquently reassigned, because by 1947 Bickler housed only grades\none through three in addition to the junior high school special\neducation program. There were 155 primary grade students in\nBickler in 1947 when that facility was closed. It was pro-\nposed that these students be reassigned to Winn and Palm. The\nboard was advised (Gov't. Ex. 6-F, Minutes, July 11, 1947):\n... that the older children in Bickler\nSchool are sub-normal and that the primary\nchildren are all Latin-American. 24 /\n24 / In 1947, before Bickler and West Avenue closed, there\nwere 1,050 students enrolled at Bickler, Zavala and West, the\nthree virtually all Mexican-American schools in the district.\n(Gov't.

The dropout rate was very high and comparatively few\nMexican-American students enrolled in the junior and senior\n25/\nhigh schools.\nC. Student Assignment Policies Since 1954\nBeginning in 1955, after the Brown decision, the school\nboard undertook a program for abolishing the dual overlapping\nzones for black schools. The first phase of this program dealt\nonly with senior high schools (grades 10-12). At that time\nthe district was served by three white high schools and one\nblack high school. Anderson, the black school, served the en-\ntire district. The white high schools were Travis - which\nserved the area south of the Colorado River, Austin - which\nserved the central part of the district including the area in\n25/ Between 1927 and 1943 less than 27. of the high school\ngraduates from Austin were Mexican Americans, at a time when\nthe school census showed that 157 of the student population\nwas Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex. 17) See also Def't. Ex. 69\nwhich shows that in 1933 Austin High, the only non-black high\nschool, had only 18 Spanish surnamed students and that in 1934\nAllan Junior High, in whose zone most Mexican-American students\nresided, had only 70 such students, while these schools enrolled\na total of 2831 Anglo students. (See als\n 1/ -\n\nwhich Anderson was located and McCallum - which served the\nnorthern part of the district. For the 1955-56 school year\nand thereafter, Anderson was given a zone which traced the\nblack residential area in East Austin. (Tr. pp. 341-42)\nThis zone which commenced at the eastern edge of the school\ndistrict was an irregular, elongated zone approximately one\nmile wide from north to south and extended approximately four\nmiles westward into the center of the Austin zone, which\nZL/\nbordered it on three sides.(cid:9) Simultaneously, the school\nboard adopted a free transfer policy which applied only to\nthe Anderson school. Under this policy, the students zoned\ninto Anderson were allowed to transfer out to traditionally\nwhite schools and students living outside the zone were\nallowed to transfer into Anderson. (Gov't. Ex. 7-A, Board\nMinutes, Aug. 8, 1955) This transfer policy was not dis-\ncontinued until 1969. only one white student attended\n26/ See map, Appendix B to this brief.\n- 18 -\n\nY\n27/\nAnderson prior to the 1969-70 school year.+\nDesegregation of grades below the tenth grade progressed\non a grade-a-year basis starting in the 1958-59 school year.\nA zone line for the traditionally black Kealing Junior High\nwas established which was identical to that for Anderson High.\nBlack junior high school students who wished to transfer to\ntraditionally \"white\" schools were limited in their options to\nthe University Junior High or Allan Junior High depending on\nwhere in the Kealing zone the transferring student resided.\nBy this time the enrollment at Allan was predominantly Mexican-\nAmerican. Like the high school level, free transfer into\nv/ School census figures for 1955-56 (Gov't. Ex. 3-C) show\nthat approximately 71 Anglo and 27 Mexican-American high school\nage students resided in the Winn Elementary zone, which for the\nmost part was within the Anderson zone. One hundred and four\nAnglo and 99 Mexican-American high school age children resided\nin the Govalle Elementary zone, part of which was in the\nAnderson zone. Yet only one white child attended Anderson\nbetween 1955 and 1969 (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information\non Integration) At the same time black students from outside\nEast Austin transferred to Anderson. For example, in 1955-56\nthere were 63 black high school students in the St. Johns\nElementary area, located in the McCallum High School zone.\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-C) The first year there is any record of a\nNegro attending McCallum is 1969-70 when there was one Negro\nout of a total enrollment of 1928. (Gov't. Ex. 2)\n- 19 -\n\nf\ni\n^a\ni\nKealing was permitted, and this policy was not discontinued(cid:9) I'\n28/\nuntil 1969.(cid:9) Kealing, like Anderson, has remained virtually\nall black. (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information).\nElementary students first began desegregating in 1961\nwith the sixth grade, and by 1963 students in all six ele-\nmentary grades were allowed to attend formerly all-white schools\nin their zone. (Gov't. Ex. 7-B, Minutes, July 10, 1961) In\n1964 the defendants still maintained two sets of maps of zone\nlines, one for formerly white schools and one for formerly\n(cid:9)\nblack schools. (Gov't. Ex. 9-C and 9-D) Black stu-\ndents from Sims could only transfer to Ortega, which by 1967-68\nwas 50% black, 457 Mexican-American and 57 Anglo; di-\nrectly north of Sims was Pecan Springs (897.

Under this policy\nblacks from outside the Kealing zone continued to transfer to\nKealing. For example, Pearce Junior High opened in 1958 with\nan enrollment of 295 Anglos and 3 Mexican Americans. Black\njunior high students from the St. Johns community continued to\ntransfer to Kealing under the transfer policy even though the\nSt. Johns area was within the Pearce zone.\n- 20 -\n\nI\n(96% Mexican-American in 1967-68), Metz (98% Mexican-American)\nor Zavala (96% Mexican-American) while Pease Elementary, di-\nrectly east of Blackshear, was 857.

In 1961, when blacks first began to transfer, Winn\nhad 161 Anglo and 96 Mexican-American elementary students. By\n1967-68 Winn was 63% black and 28% Mexican American. A new\nWinn opened in extreme northeast Austin in 1970-71 with a 947.\nAnglo enrollment.\n30/ See Gov't. Ex. 9-E. In addition between 1961 and 1965\nthree small black schools (approximately 60-65 students) were\nclosed: Montopolis (1961); Brakenridge (1965); Clarksville\n(1965). When Montopolis was closed its students were sent\nacross the Colorado River to the all-black Sims Elementary\nuntil all grades were allowed to integrate, when they were\nassigned to the predominantly Mexican American Allison Ele-\nmentary School. (Gov't. Ex. 3-D shows that in 1963-64, 455\nMexican American and 114 Anglo elementary students resided in\nthis area.) Brackenridge students were reassigned to Becker\nElementary, also predominantly Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex.\n3-E shows 426 Mexican-Americans and 298 Anglos in this area\nin 1965-66.) Clarksville students were reassigned to Mathews\nElementary (411 Anglos and 137 Mexican Americans in 1965-66).\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-E)\n- 21 -\n\nNot until 1969-70 were black elementary students given free\nchoice to attend any school in the district. (Gov't. Ex.\n7-H, Minutes, July 14, 1969) Nonetheless, the elementary\nzone map of today shows that four of the six black schools\nin East Austin still have zones which overlap with one or\n31/\nmore Mexican-American schools. (Def' t. Ex. 11)^\nD. Construction Policy Since 1950\nAfter World War II the AISD was faced with a shortage\nof school capacity, due to the increased student population\nand the absence of any construction in the district since\n1940. In 1950 it embarked on a continuous construction pro-\ngram which has resulted in the opening of 36 new elementary,\n32/\n9 new junior high and 7 new high schools. (Def't. Ex. 13)\n31/ Campbell's zone had overlapped with Winn; with the closing\nof Winn in 1969, Campbell now has its own zone. Norman, which\nopened in 1970 east of Sims, also has its own zone.\n32/ In 1950, 89% of the district's Mexican American student\npopulation and 937 of the blacks lived in East Austin.\n- 22 -\n\n2\nIn picking the sites for these schools, the defendants\nconsider capacity and neighborhood need, and claim that race\nand ethnic origin are not taken into account. (Tr. pp. 453-\n54) However, one of the major uses of the census material\nkept by the district is to study trends and projections of\npopulation concentration, growth and movement for purposes\nof planning a building program. (Tr._.329.-.3 Q) The census\nhas traditionally enumerated the number of black students\nin the district, and in 1948 and thereafter, the census\nfigures divided the \"white\" students into \"Anglo-American\"\nand \"Latin-American\" student categories.\nMuch of this construction interacted with changes in\nstudent assignment policies adopted following the Brown de-\ncision in 1954. On the high school level, only one \"white\"\nhigh school (Austin) was operated until 1953. In that year two\nhigh schools -- McCallum in North Austin and Travis in South\nAustin -- opened; Austin High then served all white students\na/See Ir Z2-28; Gov't Exs. 2, 3.(cid:9) This was one year after\nthe Gubbels' Report (Def.

The court order of September 4, 1970 rezoned these\nstudents to the predominantly Anglo Pearce Junior High.\n45/ In 1967, 87% of the black junior high students attended\nKealing, Allan and Martin; 63% of the Mexican-American junior\nhigh students attended Martin or Allan. (Def't.  Ex. 2)\n- \n28 -\n\nThree of the four all-black elementary schools opened\nsince 1954 are located in East Austin. Sims was opened in\n46 /\n1956 as an all-black school,+ and Oak Springs opened in\n1958 to house grades four through six from the all-black\nRosewood school. (See Gov. Ex. 12) More recently the\nNorman school opened in 1970 as an all-black school. The\nsite had originally been purchased as a site for a new junior\n47 /\nhigh, but abandoned because the Board felt it would not be\ndesegregated; nonetheless, an elementary school was built on\nthe same site, and, as predicted by the Board, opened all\nblack. (See Tr. pp. 387-390)\nlam/ The Gubbels' Report (Def. Ex. 91, p. 39) had recommended\nthis general area for a \"white\" school in 1947. By 1956, however,\nthe percentage of whites in East Austin was decreasing (see Gov.\nEx. 7-B) and Sims was opened as a black school with an all-black\nfaculty and student body, at a time when elementary age students\nwere still segregated.\n47/ The Gubbels' Report predicted that part of Census Tract 18\n\"can be expected to be of the low income group, including the\nnon-white.\" Because of rising property values near Airport\nBoulevard the report predicted that \"lower income groups will\nnot be able to acquire\" property there, but \"the non-white will\nfind a more possible area for settlement in the extreme east\nportion of this tract.\" (Def. Ex. 91, p. 15)(cid:9) This is where\nthe Norman school is located. Sims school is halfway_ between\nAirport Boulevard and Norman school.\n- 29 -\n\nA fourth all-black school, St. Johns, was opened in\n1958 outside of East Austin, following a recommendation in\nthe Gubbels' Report that a new school be built to replace the\n48/\nexisting all-black school in this area.(cid:9) It was built with\na capacity for 224 students (see Def. Ex. 7), and when it\nopened it was surrounded by two all-Anglo school zones (Brown\nand Harris which had opened in 1957 and 1955 respectively);\nshortly thereafter another all-Anglo school (Andrews) opened\nwith a contiguous zone. While numerous additions have sub-\nsequently been made at Harris, Brown and Andrews, St. Johns\nhas remained a small, all-black school. (See Def. Ex. 13)\nIn 1970-71 St. Johns housed 162 students (153 of whom were\nblack), while Brown, Harris and Andrews each housed over 400\nstudents and remained overwhelmingly Anglo. (See Def. Ex. 79)\nEach school that has opened in East Austin since 1950\n4s1\nhas enrolled predominantly minority race students.(cid:9) One\n1U/ Def. Ex. 91. St. Johns is the only all-black school\nlocated outside of East Austin.\n49/ Of the thirty-six elementary schools built since 1950,\ntwenty-nine of these schools were built outside of East Austin\nand all but three (one opened all black and two were over 807.\nAnglo) of these 29 schools opened with over 907, Anglo students.\nOf the nine new junior high schools built,  seven were located\noutside of East Austin, and all but Webb (87% Anglo) opened with\nan enrollment of over 90%, Anglo. Five of the six high schools\nbuilt were located outside of East Austin and all but Travis\n(80-907. Anglo) opened with over 90% Anglo students.\n- 30 -\n\nhigh school, two junior high and three elementary schools\nbuilt in this area opened with between 667 to 84% Mexican-\nAmerican students.(cid:9) Furthermore, three all black ele-\nmentary schools -- Sims (1956), Oak Springs (1958) and\nNorman (1970) -- were constructed in this area and the tra-\nditionally black Anderson High School was rebuilt on a new\nsite and opened all black in 1953. Zone lines for these\nschools were confined to East Austin.\nBecause zone lines for the schools in East Austin have\nremained static, the elementary schools in this area have be-\ncome increasingly crowded as school population increased.\nWhile new elementary schools have been built to relieve over-\ncrowded conditions in north and south Austin, the predominantly\nMexican-American elementary schools in East Austin have been relieved\nwith portable classrooms.

In 1969-70, 43.2% of black crossover\nteachers were assigned to predominantly Mexican-American\nschools and 56.87. to Anglo schools.\n54/ At trial the AISD made certain modifications of their\nelementary school plan. (Def. Ex. 77, 78, 80; Tr. 930-33)\nFollowing the June 28, 1971 order, modifications were made to\nthe secondary plan. See Report and Submission, July 15, 1971.\n- 33 -\n\nOn the secondary level, both the black Anderson high school\nand the black Kealing junior high school will be closed in\n55/\nthe 1971-72 school year.(cid:9) Black students who attended\nthese schools in 1970-71 have been rezoned both contiguously\nand non-contiguously into the remaining seven high schools and\nten junior high schools in the system.

Transportation of\n2350 students, virtually all of whom are black, will be\nrequired under this secondary school plan, requiring 40 new\nbuses.

(Memorandum Opinion and Order, July 19, 1971, p. 11)\n2. Elementary Schools\nThe defendants' plan as approved by the district\ncourt assigns all students initially by the same\nzone lines that were maintained in 1970-71, except for the St.\nJohns school, and which will result in approximately the\nsame degree of racial and ethnic separation that existed\n58/\nin 1970-71.(cid:9) In addition, the plan has organized six clusters\n.U/ \nThe defendants submitted projected zone lines for these\nschools (Def. Ex. 31, 32, 33) which would actually decrease de-\nsegregation. Blacks who will be non-contiguously zoned to three\nhigh schools and five junior high schools are rezoned to Johnston,\nAllan and Martin. Under this rezoning 3 high schools and 7 junior\nhigh schools would be 97% Anglo (Def. Ex. 33); at the same time\nthe black enrollments at the Johnston, Allan and Martin schools\n(which are already over 90% minority group) would be increased.\n(See also Tr. 906-13)\n58/ See Def. Ex. 11. In 1970-71, 81% of the black elementary\nstudents and 60% of the Mexican-American elementary students\nattended schools that were over 90% minority. In 1971-72 St.\nJohns (94% black) will be closed and its students reassigned to\nBrown (78% Anglo) and Harris (93% Anglo). (Report and Submis-\nsion, July 15, 1971; Order, September 4, 1970). Overlapping zone\nlines for black and predominantly Mexican-American schools in East\nAustin will apparently continue.\n- 35 -\n\nof schools which include 40 schools and approximately 22,000\nstudents. Each cluster includes two or three minority schools\n(at least one of which is predominantly black and one\npredominantly Mexican-American) and four or five predominantly\nMexican-American) and four or five predominantly Anglo schools.\n(Def. Ex. 78)\nIntegrated activities for the students in each cluster\nwill be scheduled every fourth week. These activities will\nconsist of (1) visits to \"learning resource centers\" which\nwill be established at the former black secondary schools\nwhich have been closed (Anderson and Kealing) and at a\nclosed elementary school (Baker); (2) inter-site visits in\nwhich students of grade level will meet at one of the\nschools in the cluster; and (3) field trips involving all\nstudents from a cluster. These integrated activities will\ncover four curriculum areas -- fine arts, social studies,\nsciences and vocational courses. During the integrated\nactivities students will be assigned to small instructional\ngroups of 6-8 students and will include black, Anglo and\nMexican-American students. Basic subject areas such as\nreading and mathematics will continue to be taught only in\nthe school of original assignment. (See Def. Ex. 78, 80;\nTr. pp. 773-800)\n- 36 -\n\nTransportation of nearly all students in a given\ncluster will be required during a week of such activities.\nFor one week of activities defendants estimate that 63\nbuses will be needed for the transportation of one cluster\nof schools (each cluster contains between 3500-4000 students).\nStudents will be picked up at their neighborhood school\nafter the school day has begun and return before the school\n`/\nday is over, thus allowing the district to use the same\nbuses that will transport secondary students to transport\n60 /\nthese elementary students.(cid:9) A full schedule for all six\nclusters insuring integrated activities 257 of the school\nyear had not been worked out at the time of trial.

(Tr. 944)\n- 37 -\n\nDISCUSSION\nIntroduction\nThis case raises difficult questions which, because\nof their importance, we feel obliged to present to this\nCourt. What is the relief required by Swann v. Board of\nEducation, 402 U.S. 1 as to the eradication of Austin's old\ndual system of segregation of white from black? What facts\nestablish a case of illegal discrimination in assignment of\nMexican-American and Anglo students in the white part of the\ndual system? If there has been an illegal separation of\nMexican American from Anglo as well as black from white,\nwhat is the appropriate remedy?\nAppellate review of the case is rendered difficult\nby a combination of circumstances. In spite of the lengthy\nrecord and the specificity of the proof (largely based upon\nofficial records rather than witness testimony) the district\ncourt did not make specific findings of fact but instead\nmade general recitations mixing findings of ultimate fact\nwith conclusions of law. Because of this it is often not\npossible to tell what legal standards were followed in assessing\n- 38 -\n\nthe facts or even which alleged facts were accepted as true\nand which were rejected as false. Second, the district\ncourt had before it remedies which it apparently judged\ninappropriate; therefore, it initially declined to order\neither the board plan or the HEW plan into effect. Ulti-\nmately the court elected to order into effect one inappro-\npriate remedy rather than the other. It seems clear to us\nthat a new remedy must be fashioned, but that cannot be\ndone until the nature and extent of discrimination against\nMexican-Americans has been determined.\nI. MEXICAN-AMERICANS AS A RACIAL OR ETHNIC CLASS\nUNDER BROWN\nThe district court was clearly correct in\nfinding that Mexican-Americans are a separate ethnic\nminority in Austin and thus a group entitled to the equal pro-\ntection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hernandez v.\nTexas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954); Alvarado v. El Paso Independent School\nDistrict, No. 71-1555 (5th Cir., decided June 16, 1971);\n- 39 -\n\ncf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Yick\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886). This finding\nwas made on the basis of many of these decisions, on the\ndefendants' appointment of a tri-ethnic committee, on\ntestimony of the defendants' Superintendent, and \"by even\nthe most casual examination of Mexican-American culture.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p.2) In\naddition, the AISD's historical maintenance of \"Mexican\"\nschools, their enumeration of Mexican-Americans in compiling\n61l Many earlier decisions have established this principle\nin school desegregation cases.

Presently pending on appeal before this Court are\ntwo other cases which have made the same finding. Cisneros\nand United States v. Corpus Christi Independent School District,\n324 F. Supp. 599 (S.D. Tex. 1970) (No. 71-2367 on appeal);\nTasby v. Estes, C. A. No. 3-4211-C (N.D. Tex., July 16, 1971)\n(No. 71-2581 on appeal). And see Mr. Justice Douglas' comments\nin denying a stay for Chinese students of a school desegregation\norder in San Francisco: \"Brown v. Board of Education was not\nwritten for Blacks alone ... The theme of our school desegre-\ngation cases extends to all racial minorities treated invidiously\nby a State or any of its agencies.\" Lee v. Johnson, No. A-203\n(Douglas, Circuit Justice, August 25, 1971).\n- 40 -\n\n9\ncensus statistics, and their more recent recognition of\ncitizens' groups representing the Mexican-American community\n62 /\nreinforce this finding.\nII. PRE-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nAs the district court noted, prior to 1955 the de-\nfendants \"maintained a dual school system with educational\nopportunities separate and inherently unequal for blacks.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 3) This\nsystem was characterized by overlapping attendance zones\nand complete segregation of black students and black faculty\nat all grade levels in the system. The defendant school\ndistrict thus fell squarely within the command of Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), 349 U.S. 294 (1955),\nand was under an affirmative duty to eliminate \"all vestiges\nof state-imposed segregation.\" Swann v. Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).\nWe start from the fact that neither the State of\nTexas nor the defendants have ever officially required the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in schools. There\n62' Gov't. Ex. 3; 6-J, 6-K.\n- 41 -\n\nis evidence, however, that some of the pre-Brown practices\nand policies with regard to Mexican-Americans in Austin\nwere similar to the discriminatory student assignment\npolicies traditionally applied to black students.\nThe district court noted the pre-Brown existence of\nsome schools designated as \"Mexican\" schools, with all\nMexican-American enrollments and attendance zones which\noverlapped with predominantly Anglo schools, but it none-\ntheless found that these schools were not \"built for the\npurpose of discriminating against, isolating or segregating\nstudents on the basis of Mexican-American ethnic origin.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, fn. 12(c))\nfinding \nWe think this  is erroneous in view of the court's\nown finding, and the record in this case. The evidence\nshows that the defendants created and maintained, at various\ntimes prior to 1954, three such schools in the system with\n63/\nzones overlapping Anglo school zones.(cid:9) The creation and\nmaintenance of overlapping or \"optional\" attendance zones\n63/ These were the West Avenue School, the Comal Street School,\nand the Zavala School, which replaced the Comal Street School\nwhen it opened in 1936. The Zavala School was built to meet\nthe need of the Mexican-American population \"as near the center\nof this population as possible,\" and parts of the school curri-\nculum were designed for junior high age Mexican-American migrant\nstudents who were still attending elementary school. See pp.10-14.\nsupra.\n- 42 -\n\n0\nis constitutional only if it does not encourage or preserve\nsegregation. See Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683,\n686 (1963); Monroe v. Board of School Commissioners, 391 U.S.\n450, 458-59 (1968); Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401,\n415-17 (D.D.C. 1967); aff'd sub nom Smuck v. Hobson, 408\nF.2d 175, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1969). In addition, the court\noverlooked uncontroverted evidence showing the discriminatory\nassignment of Mexican-American elementary students to the\nBickler school in 1939 after Anglo parents had objected\nto the assignment of these students to the predominantly\n64/\nAnglo Winn school.\nFinally, the court ignored uncontroverted evidence\nthat when the dual zone for Zavala and Metz was eliminated\nin 1954, the new zone line was drawn on Third Street, immediately\nadjacent to the Zavala school, with the result that Zavala\nremained virtually all Mexican-American. Discrimination in\nthe drawing of zone lines in a school system purportedly\nfit/ \nBy 1947 all elementary age students at Bickler were\nMexican-American. During this same period, the school board\nfailed to act on a request of the Mexican consul in 1944 to\neliminate the segregation situation at the Zavala and Metz\nschools. See pp. 15-16 , supra.\n- 43 -\n\nfollowing a neighborhood school policy has been held un-\nlawful. See,., Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate\nSchool System, 409 F.2d 682 (5th Cir. 1969); United States v.\nSchool District 151, 404 F.2d ll25 j7th_Cir.1968); United States v.\nBoard of Education, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 429 F.2d 1253 (10th Cir.1970).\nIII. POST-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nThe district court found that defendants have not\ndiscriminated against black or Mexican-American students\nsince Brown II. As to blacks, the court ruled that relief\nwas required to eradicate the vestiges of the pre-1955 dual\nsystem. For that reason, on appellate review the main\nissue is whether the district court's holding as to Mexican-\nAmericans was correct.\nWe would agree that the record might support a\nfinding that defendants did not engage in a purposeful\nsystematic program intended to discriminate against all\n5/ Nonetheless, we think the record requires reversal of\nthe finding that defendants have not discriminated against\nblacks since 1955. Such a finding is inconsistent with the\ncontinued maintenance of dual, overlapping zones, the building\nof the under-sized all-black St. Johns school surrounded by\nthree white schools, the selection of other elementary school\nsites in areas where the new schools constructed would be\nall-black, the construction of additions to predominantly\none-race schools adjacent to schools serving opposite race\nstudents, the continuation of faculty segregation, and the\ndrawing of secondary school attendance zone lines intended\nto segregate.\n- 44 -\n\nMexican-American students. Indeed, as to some predominantly\nMexican-American schools there is no proof of discrimination.\nBut the district court failed to find specific facts as\nto the cause of the undoubted isolation of minority group\nstudents in most of East Austin, in spite of a voluminous\nrecord demonstrating that defendants knew their actions\nwould further separate Mexican-American students from Anglo\nstudents.\nIn the years immediately before and after Brown,\ndefendants took the following actions which increased the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in East Austin:\n(a) The construction of three secondary\nschools attended predominantly by Mexican-\nAmerican students and simultaneous abandonment\nof two centrally-located secondary schools\nin which Anglo and Mexican-American students would\nhave remained integrated.\n(b) In some instances the drawing of zone\nlines and creation of optional zones to minimize\nthe number of Anglo students in minority group\nschools and the number of minority group students\nin Anglo schools. The most notable example is\nthe Martin Junior High School zone.\nSuch evidence would not, of itself, establish discrimination.\nIf the defendants lumped Anglo and Mexican-American students\ntogether for all purposes as \"white\" students, the evidence\n- 45 -\n\nwould merely reflect that some white schools were built in\nEast Austin and some in other parts of Austin. But the\nevidence shows that defendants considered the Mexican-\nAmericans a separate ethnic group, and the inference\ntherefore could be made that some construction and zone\ndrawing were affected by the distinction. In 1948,\nafter the Mexican-American student population had grown and\n66/\nthe Mexican-American drop-out rate had begun its decline,\nthe defendants changed their student census from an\nenumeration of blacks and whites to an enumeration of\nblacks, Anglos, and Mexican-Americans.(cid:9) Since school\nconstruction needs and zone line changes were projected\nlargely on the basis of the census data, this change in\n66/ In 1933-34 only 3% of the \"white\" secondary students were\nMexican-American; in 1970-71 this number had increased to 20%.\nThe number of Mexican-American secondary students likewise\nincreased from 88 to 4286 in the same period. (See Def. Exs.\n69,79)\n67/ This change in administrative practice occurred in 1948,\nalmost simultaneously with the completion of a twenty-year\nprojection of school construction plans which has guided much\nof defendants' construction activities since 1950. See Def.\nEx. 91 (The Gubbels' Report), and p. 23, -supra.(cid:9) The\nenumeration of \"Latin-Americans\" was, according to the testimony,\nbegun as a \"research project\" and continued because it was\n\"very interesting and revealing.\" (Tr. pp. 327-28)\n- 46 -\n\noperation provided the means for considering the ethnic\nimpact of construction and zone drawing decisions. Cf.\nAvery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 562 (1953); Whitus v. Georgia,\n385 U.S. 545, 552 (1967). Further, defendants admittedly\ntook race and ethnic origin into account in drawing certain\nof the zone lines during this period. Compare the rationale\nfor separating blacks and Mexican-Americans on the high\nschool level (\"insecurity and competition economically\n68/\namong the ... 'Negro' and 'Latin-American'...'')(cid:9) with\nthe rationale for gerrymandering black students into Martin\n[and presumably Allan] Junior High Schools instead of the\nnearer, predominantly Anglo Baker Junior High (integrating\n69 /\n\"white\" and black students). And when defendants set up\noptional zones so blacks could transfer to \"white\" schools,\nin almost every instance the school was virtually all\n68/ Tr. pp. 341-45; Gov. Ex. 7-E.\n69/ Tr. p. 382. See appendix A-4 and C. Where inconsistent\ngrounds for school board action are given or stated grounds\nare inconsistently applied, an inference of discrimination\nis raised. Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,\n443 F.2d 573, 576 (6th Cir. 1971).\n- 47 -\n\nMexican-American. Cf. Ross v. Eckels, 434 F.2d 1140, 1150\n70/\n(5th Cir. 1970) (Clark, J. dissenting).\nThe task of this Court, then, is to assess the probative\neffect of these inferences on the outcome of this appeal; or,\nin the alternative, to remand for further hearing and findings\nby the district court.\nIn finding no de jure discrimination, the court below\napparently referred only to the testimony adduced below, and\nignored the voluminous documentary evidence introduced into\nthe record. The law is well-settled that inferences of dis-\ncrimination may be drawn from such documentary evidence,\nand they may be conclusive despite testimony of racial\nneutrality by responsible officials. See, e.g., Hernandez\nv. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 481-82 (1954); Turner v. Fouche,\n396 U.S. 346, 360-61 (1970), and cases cited therein in notes\n20-22; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 598 (1935); Keyes v.\n70/ In considering possible remedies, the district court\nstated that the \"burden\" of desegregation of blacks should not\nbe placed solely on Mexican-Americans, and announced that this\nshould be a consideration in preparing desegregation plans.\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 6)\n- 48 -\n\nSchool District No. 1, 303 F. Supp. 279, 313 F. Supp. 61\n(D. Colo. 1969), aff'd(cid:9) - F. 2d(cid:9) (No. 336-70, decided\nJune 11, 1971); Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; United States v. School District 151, supra.\nThe impact of these and other inferences should be\nconsidered and decided by this Court, especially should\nit decide to remand for further proceedings below. Some\nof the questions discussed herein as well as other related\n11/\nissues, have been considered by Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nbut they are generally questions of first impression for this\nCourt. Therefore, we think it appropriate for this Court\nto consider the need for specific criteria of evidentiary\nanalysis to be applied by district courts facing these\nsituations. The need for such criteria is emphasized by a\ncomparison of the decision of the court below in this case\nwith the decision of the district court in Cisneros v.\nCorpus Christi Independent School District, 324 F. Supp. 599\n121\n(S.D. Texas 1970), which is also on appeal to this Court.\nj1 \t e.g., \nDavis v. School Board of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; Keyes v. School District No. 1, supra; United States\nV. School District 151, supra; Taylor v. Boarder Education,\n294 F. 2d 36 (2nd Cir. 1969).\nj/ Appeal No. 71-2397.\n- 49 -\n\nAlthough district courts sit as courts of equity in these\ncases, with broad powers, some degree of detail and\nspecificity is necessary to evaluate the evidence of\ndiscrimination, just as some guidelines are necessary for\na determination of questions of relief. Cf. Swann v.\nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 6, 26 (1971).\nIV. THE RELIEF\nIn fashioning relief for this case, the district\ncourt had before it two desegregation plans drawn and\nsubmitted prior to the presentation of the facts at trial\nconcerning the nature and extent of discrimination within\nthe Austin School System. The HEW plan, which was prepared\nin response to the district court order of September 4, 1970\nto make a comprehensive study and prepare a plan \"which will\ncompletely disestablish a dual school system,\" was based\non the assumption that de 'lure discrimination against both\nblacks and Mexican-Americans existed system-wide; consequently,\nit was drawn to eliminate the ethnic and racial identifiability\nof every school in the system. It also adopted on a full-time\nbasis the cluster system for elementary schools which defen-\ndants had adopted on a part-time basis. The plan submitted\n- 50 -\n\nby the defendants apparently assumed that no de jure dis-\n73 /\ncrimination had ever been practiced against Mexican-Americans,\nand that only vestiges of the dual school system which had\nbeen maintained for blacks prior to 1955 remained.\nThe district court's June 28, 1971 opinion found that\nthe evidence in the case supported defendants' assumption\nand accordingly its subsequent remedial order of July 19,\n1971 approved the defendants' plan. We agree that the scope\nof the remedy ordered in cases of this kind ought to be\nconsistent with the nature of the violation. But here the\ndistrict court's findings as to the quantum of officially-\nimposed discrimination are erroneous both as to blacks and\nMexican-Americans. Since it now appears that the evidence\nas to de jure discrimination against Mexican-Americans does\nnot extend to all Mexican-American schools as assumed by the\nHEW plan, a remand to the district court to consider the ex-\ntent of the relief warranted in this case appears proper. The\nfollowing discussion is submitted for the Court's considera-\ntion as to the direction that such an inquiry might take.\n73/ Defendants' plan did include Mexican-American schools in\nits elementary desegregation plan; it did so for educational\npurposes, not as a matter of constitutional duty. Tr. pp.799-800.\n- 51 -\n\nA. BLACK SCHOOLS\nThe facts in this case establish a formerly state-\nimposed dual school system which was never disestablished.\nWhile the district court plan eliminates all secondary schools\nidentifiable as black schools, the elementary school plan\ninitially assigns black students to schools in the same\nmanner as during 1970-71 (which still include some dual over-\nlapping zones with predominantly Mexican-American schools).\n74/\nPart-time desegregation is provided for 16% of the time.\nWhile this may have much to commend it educationally, standing\nalone it does not eradicate the dual system. See Bivins v.\nBibb County Board of Education, 424 F.2d 97 (5th Cir. 1970).\nThe district court distinguishes this case from Bibb on\nits facts, stating that the defendants' plan \"encompasses\nvirtually all of the system's Anglo elementary students\nfor a much larger portion of their academic time in a\nfar wider and more meaningful range of multi-cultural ex-\nperiences.\" (Memorandum Opinion and Order, July 19, 1971,\n74 / Computed by multiplying the percent of school days (25%)\nspent in integrated classes by the percent of each such day\nin such classes (4-1/2 of each 7 hours; or 64%).\n- 52 -\n\np. 8) Yet, the initial discriminatory assignment of students\nunder this plan will govern at least 8 of their learning\n141. \nexperience. In the context of this case where each black\nschool in the system was created and has been maintained at\nall times as an all-black school, such a P' lan can hardly be\nsaid to meet the school board's duty to take 'whatever steps\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination is eliminated root and branch.\" Green\nv. New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968). On remand\nthe district court should consider other approaches to desegre-\ngating the black elementary schools.\nB. MEXICAN-ANERICAN \nSCHOOLS\nThe evidence in this case reveals that the nature of\nthe defendants' constitutional violation with regards to\nMexican-Americans does not permeate the entire school system.\nTherefore, the Court should decide at which schools there\nis proof of discrimination and should limit its relief to\neradicating the effects of that discrimination.\n- 53 -\n\nC ONC LUS ION\nFor the above reasons, the case should be reversed\nand remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWILLIAM SESSIONS(cid:9) DAVID L.

Procedural History\nThis school desegregation case was filed by the United\nStates pursuant to Section 407(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a) and (b), on August 7, 1970\nagainst the Texas Education Agency and seven independent\nschool districts, including the Austin Independent School\nDistrict (hereinafter, the defendants or the AISD), located in the\nWestern District of Texas. The complaint alleged that these\nschool districts had traditionally operated dual school sys-\ntems based on race and that their present student and faculty\nassignment policies had failed to eliminate all vestiges of\nthese dual systems. In addition, it was alleged that three\nof the local districts, including the AISD, were discrimina-\ntorily assigning Mexican-American students to schools identi-\nfiable as Mexican-American schools or as schools intended for\n1.J\nonly black and Mexican-American students.\n1/ After this complaint was filed, a motion to intervene as\nplaintiff and complaint in intervention were filed on behalf\nof Mexican-American students. This motion was denied by the\ncourt on August 24, 1970. Subsequently, in February, 1971 a\nseparate action was brought on behalf of the Mexican-Americans\nagainst the AISD. On June 10, 1971 the court denied the motion\nof plaintiffs in that case for consolidation and joint hearing\nof that case with this action.\n-2 -\n\nOn August 7, 1970 the district court issued an order\nrequiring the defendants, among others, to formulate and submit a\ndesegregation plan to the Texas Education Agency and repre-\nsentatives of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\n(hereinafter HEW). If no agreement was reached between the\nparties as to an acceptable plan, the defendant school dis-\ntricts and HEW were to file respective plans with the court.\nA hearing concerning the plans developed for the defendants was held\non August 27, 1970 at which the United States submitted an\ninterim desegregation plan prepared by HEW. After the hearing\nthe district court orally ordered that this interim plan be\nimplemented immediately. On September 4, 1970 the district\ncourt amended the oral order in a written order requiring\nimmediate implementation of the standard provisions of Single-\nton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School System, 419 F. 2d\n1211 (5th Cir. 1969) pertaining to faculty and staff, con-\nstruction, transportation, majority-to-minority transfer pro-\nvisions and attendance outside the system. In addition, HEW\nwas ordered to conduct a comprehensive study of the Austin School\nDistrict and prepare a plan to completely desegregate all schools in\n\n2/\nthe district.(cid:9) Following court orders of December 15, 1970,\nIF.\nFebruary 26, 1971, April 14, 1971 and May 7, 1971 extending\nthe date for filing plans, the parties filed desegregation\n3/\nplans with the district court on May 14, 1971.\nA six day trial on the merits was held June 14 through\nJune 21, 1971. On June 28, 1971 the district court entered\na memorandum opinion and order which found that, while Mexican-\nAmericans constituted a separate ethnic minority in Austin, no\nde jure discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin\nhad been practiced against Mexican-Americans in the operation\nof the AISD. As to blacks, the court found that vestiges of\nthe dual school system based on race still existed. The court\nordered the parties to renegotiate in an effort to reach agree-\nment on a common plan based on these findings and upon certain\nguidelines contained in the order.\n2/ Defendants' Officials were ordered to consult and cooperate\nwith HEW in preparation of the plan; if the parties were able\nto agree upon a plan, it was to be submitted to the court by\n15, \nDecember  1970, and if the parties failed to agree, separate\nplans were to be filed by the parties.\n3/ Defendants' plan as filed on May 14, 1971 is contained\nin Defendants Exhibits 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. The\nplan was updated and modified slightly at trial. (See Def. Ex.\n77, 78 and 80; Tr. 930-933.) The HEW plan was filed in the\nform of a letter to Dr. Jack Davidson commenting on  defendants'\nproposal and making further recommendations.\n\nThe parties jointly reported to the district court on\nJuly 15, 1971 that although agreement had been reached on de-\nfendants' high school plan, 4/ disagreements still existed\nconcerning the junior high and elementary school plans. On\nJuly 19, 1971 the district court entered another memorandum\nopinion and order approving the defendants' desegregation plan,\nand notice of appeal from both the June 28 and July 19, 1971\nmemorandum opinions and orders was filed by the United States\non August 3, 1971.\n2. Decision of the Court Below on Discrimination\nIn its June 28, 1971, Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nthe district court specifically found that Mexican-Americans\nconstitute a separate ethnic group in Austin. However, the\ncourt held that there has been no de jure discrimination\nagainst Mexican-Americans, based on its findings of fact set\nout as follows:\n4/ Agreement upon the high school plan was based upon the\ncourt's finding of June 28, 1971 and it was stated that nothing\nin this report was to be read to indicate agreement with those\nfindings by both parties.\n- 5 -\n\n(a) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever adopted, published or promulgated any\nwritten or unwritten rules, regulation or\npolicies having as their purpose the dis-\ncrimination against, or segregation or iso-\nlation of, Mexican Americans.\n(b) The Austin Independent School District has\nnever discriminated against, or attempted to\ndiscriminate against, isolate or segregate\nMexican Americans in any form whatsoever,\nparticularly in:\n(1) site location of schools;\n(2) school construction;\n(3) drawing of school attendance zones;\n(4) student assignments;\n(5) faculty assignments;\n(6) staff assignments;\n(7) faculty and staff employment;\n(8) extracurricular activities; and\n(9) transportation.\n(c) The Zavala and West Elementary Schools were not\nbuilt for the purpose of discriminating against,\nisolating or segregating students on the basis\nof Mexican American ethnic origin. 5/\nThe court also found that vestiges of the previous dual\nsystem with respect to black students still exist. Because of\nthe general nature of the court's findings on the question of\ndiscrimination, we will set out the facts in this area in some\ndetail.\n5/ Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 2 and\nfootnote 12. Despite finding no de jure segregation against\nMexican-Americans, the court stated it would \"consider the\neffect\" upon Mexican-Americans of any plan submitted by the\nparties. Id, p. 6.\n- 6 -\n\n3. Facts\nA. School District Demography\nThe AISD encompasses the City of Austin and some\nterritory outside the city limits, extending approximately\n30 miles north and south and about 25 miles east and west,\nwith a total area of 230 square miles. During the 1970-71\nschool year a total of 35,496 (657.) Anglo students, 11,194\n(20%) Mexican American students and 8,284 (1570) black\nstudents were enrolled in 74 schools in the district. (Def.\nEx. 79) .\nThe black and Mexican-American populations are con-\ncentrated largely in a region known as East Austin, an area\nbounded roughly by an interstate highway and downtown Austin\non the west, 19th Street and the municipal airport on the\nnorth, the Colorado River (and old Colorado school district)\n6/\non the south, and the school district line on the east. The\nblack population is generally concentrated in the northern\nsector of this area, while the Mexican-American population\n6/ The vast majority of the city's low income families are\namong the minority 35 percent of the population and are con-\ncentrated in the eastern part of the city.

Mexican-American and black. Approximately 77% of the dis-\ntrict's black students and 597. of the district's Mexican-\n8/\nAmerican students attended these schools in 1970-71.^\nOutside of East Austin the population is primarily Anglo,\nbut there are three schools with a minority enrollment of over\n70%. There is a small black community in the north central por-\ntion of the district served by the St. Johns Elementary School\n(987. minority in 1970-71); a concentration of Mexican-Americans\nsouth of the river and west of the interstate served by the\nBecker Elementary School (75% minority in 1970-71); and a pre-\ndominantly minority area directly north of East Austin between\nthe airport and the interstate, served by the Maplewood Ele-\nmentary School (707. minority in 1970-71). Prior to the 1969-70\nschool year this was a white Anglo school.\n7/ Defendants' Exhibits 5, 10, 12, filed in August, 1970, are\npupil locator maps showing Anglo, black and Mexican-American stu-\ndent concentrations throughout the school district.

Ex. 79.(cid:9) J\n- 8 -\n\nB. Historical Student Assignment Policies\nThe defendants have traditionally assigned students\non the basis of attendance zones, 9/ but until 1955 dual\noverlapping zone lines were maintained for all \"white\" and\n\"black\" schools.(cid:9) In 1953-54 nine all-black schools\nwere maintained under this system -- one senior high school,\none junior high school and seven elementary schools. 10/\nThe secondary schools and three of the elementary schools\nwere located in the area of heaviest black concentration\nbetween 19th and 6th Streets. u/\nJ\n10/ For location of these schools, see Def. Ex. 91, p. 43 and\nmap 8). One small elementary school, Montopolis, was located\nin the irregularly shaped strip of land south of the river in\nsoutheast Austin. Three other elementary schools --\nBrackenridge, Clarksville and St. Johns -- were located outside\nof East Austin to serve small black communities. Approximately\n8970 of the district's black secondary students resided in East\nAustin (Gov. Ex. 3-B); the remaining 11% (or approximately 160)\nof the eligible students had to travel to East Austin for junior\nand senior high school.\n11/ The 1947 school survey refers to this area as the \"mother\nzone.\" It points out that if the survey recommendations for new\nschools are followed:\nThe population will desire to live there instead of\nmoving elsewhere, especially the present home owners\nand those with children. In so doing, the School\nBoard will have contributed a valuable service to the\nnon-white population as well as to the people of Austin.\n(Def. Ex. 91, p. 45).\n\nAlthough there was not rigidly-enforced separation\nof Mexican-American students to the degree that blacks were\nseparated, there were some dual overlapping zones between\n\"Mexican\" and Anglo elementary schools. The earliest in-\nformation concerning a \"Mexican\" school relates to the West\nAvenue school located at the corner of West Avenue and Fourth\nStreet, five blocks south of Pease, an Anglo elementary school.\nUnlike all other elementary schools in Austin, the West Avenue\nschool had no gdeeogfriapnheicd 3zo3n1e )(;Ir .instead, it(cid:9) I/\nshared a zone with the Pease school and enrolled a majority of\n12/\nthe Mexican-American students in the school district.\nIn 1924 the defendants built a new elementary school\nat Comal Street and Third Avenue, named the Comal Street School.\nThis school was designated as a \"Mexican\" school, and was built\nto serve the \"large number of non-English speaking students\"\n/ Def't. Ex. 69 indicates that in 1916 West Avenue, a five\nclassroom structure, enrolled 280 Mexican-Americans and no\nAnglos. Pease, a fourteen classroom school, enrolled 631\nAnglos and 40 Mexican-Americans. In addition, there were\nnine other \"white\" elementary schools operated at this time.\nThe scholastic census for 1915-16 indicated that there were\nonly 316 Mexican American students in the entire school dis-\ntrict.

Three blocks south of this new\nli/\n\"Mexican\" school(cid:9) was the Metz school, which served the Anglo\nchildren in this area. Defendants drew one zone line encompassing\nthe two schools, and Mexican-American students who lived in this\nzone were encouraged and, in some cases, directed by the princi-\n20 /\npal of Metz to attend Zavala;(cid:9) Anglo children who lived across\nthe street from Zavala nonetheless attended Metz, and Mexican-\nAmericans living nearer to Metz traveled past Metz to go to Zavala.\nUnder this arrangement Zavala enrolled all Mexican-Americans and\nMetz was virtually all Anglo. (I(cid:9) Gov't. Ex. 49,\n21/ In 1938 the planning commission approved a \"Mexican\" housing\nproject located \"within a block of the new Mexican school and\nwithin walking distance from the Mexican recreation and playground\npark.\" (Gov't.

With the construction of\nZavala and closing of Comal in 1936, West and Zavala were the\nonly schools in the district which were encompassed by the\nattendance zones of other elementary schools, i.e., Pease and\nMetz. (I .UJ )\n- 13 -\n\nM\n21/\np. 12-13)(cid:9) By 1940 there were approximately 1400 elementary\nage Mexican-American children (Gov't. Ex. 1) and 791 of these\nstudents (567) were enrolled in the two \"Mexican\" schools\n22/\nwhose attendance zones overlapped Anglo school zones.`\nAt the same time that Zavala was built in 1935, the\ndefendants discontinued as a regular elementary school the\nBickler school, which was the only Anglo school in which\nMexican-American students had become a majority. The facility\nwas converted into an \"opportunity\" school for low-achieving\njunior high school students, and the curriculum became voca-\ntionally oriented. (Def't. Ex. 69; Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes,\n2/ One student who attended Metz in 1941 recalled only five\nor six Mexican-Americans at that school. (Tr. 49) Mexican-\nAmericans complained about this situation in 1944, requesting\nthe Board to require Anglos to attend Zavala, but no action\nwas taken. (Gov't. Ex. 6-H, Minutes, April 10, 1944, July 11,\n1944; Gov't. Ex. 19, p. 9-10) Not until 1954-55 were zone\nlines established between Metz and Zavala, when this area\nhad become predominantly Mexican-American, with a census of\n(Ir.\n329 Anglo and 1018 Mexican-American elementary students. \n422; Gov't. Ex. 3-B) The zone line was drawn along Third\nStreet immediately adjacent to the Zavala school. (Gov't. Ex.\n9-B) As a consequence, Zavala remained virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican, while Metz had a predominantly Mexican-American\ncensus in its area. The Anglo enrollment at Metz has further\ndeclined since that time, leaving it virtually all Mexican-\nAmerican today.\n22/ West Avenue enrolled 65 students and Zavala enrolled 726.\n(Gov't. Ex. 4) While there were approximately 1400 eligible\nelementary students, the high dropout rate of Mexican-American\nstudents makes it unlikely that this number was enrolled in\nschool. (See Gov't. Ex. 20)\n- 14 -\n\nAug. 8, 1935)(cid:9) The regular elementary students who had\nattended Bickler were reassigned to nearby schools by\nabolishing the Bickler zone and reapportioning it among\nthe zones for Winn, Palm and Metz (Zavala). Additional\nclassrooms were provided at Winn and Palm to accommodate\nthese children. (Gov't. Ex. 6-C, Minutes, August 8, 1935,\nNovember 14, 1935)\nIn 1939, a committee from the Winn school complained\nto the Board about the Mexican-American pupils who had been\ntransferred to that school from Bickler stating that they\nfelt the Winn school \"should not be asked to take all of\nthese pupils and asked for some relief.\" (Gov't. Ex. 6-F,\n.a/ Bickler was located at 11th and what is now the Inter-\nregional. Both Zavala and Bickler (once it became an oppor-\ntunity school) enrolled a large number of migrant Mexican-\nAmerican students. Because many of the students at Zavala\nwere older than regular elementary students (Gov't.  Ex. 20)\ncertain physical education and homemaking courses were offered\nto these students. (Tr. 323-4, 425-8, 511)\n- 15 -\n\nMinutes, Sept. 11, 1939) On September 25, 1939, the superin-\ntendent reported to the board:\n... that all Mexican pupils, enrolled in\nthe John B. Winn School, living south of\n14th Street, had been transferred to Bickler\nSchool, except one boy who is being allowed\nto complete the 7A grade in John B. Winn.\n(Gov't. Ex. 6-F)\nApparently the upper elementary grades were subse-\nquently reassigned, because by 1947 Bickler housed only grades\none through three in addition to the junior high school special\neducation program. There were 155 primary grade students in\nBickler in 1947 when that facility was closed. It was pro-\nposed that these students be reassigned to Winn and Palm. The\nboard was advised (Gov't. Ex. 6-F, Minutes, July 11, 1947):\n... that the older children in Bickler\nSchool are sub-normal and that the primary\nchildren are all Latin-American. 24 /\n24 / In 1947, before Bickler and West Avenue closed, there\nwere 1,050 students enrolled at Bickler, Zavala and West, the\nthree virtually all Mexican-American schools in the district.\n(Gov't. Ex. 4) Gov't. Ex. 1 indicates that there were 3369\nMexican-Americans in the census, and approximately 1700 of\nthese were elementary aged students.\n- 16 -\n\nDuring the period prior to 1950 the defendants did\nnot attempt to segregate Mexican-Americans on the secondary\nlevel. The dropout rate was very high and comparatively few\nMexican-American students enrolled in the junior and senior\n25/\nhigh schools.\nC. Student Assignment Policies Since 1954\nBeginning in 1955, after the Brown decision, the school\nboard undertook a program for abolishing the dual overlapping\nzones for black schools. The first phase of this program dealt\nonly with senior high schools (grades 10-12). At that time\nthe district was served by three white high schools and one\nblack high school. Anderson, the black school, served the en-\ntire district. The white high schools were Travis - which\nserved the area south of the Colorado River, Austin - which\nserved the central part of the district including the area in\n25/ Between 1927 and 1943 less than 27. of the high school\ngraduates from Austin were Mexican Americans, at a time when\nthe school census showed that 157 of the student population\nwas Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex. 17) See also Def't. Ex. 69\nwhich shows that in 1933 Austin High, the only non-black high\nschool, had only 18 Spanish surnamed students and that in 1934\nAllan Junior High, in whose zone most Mexican-American students\nresided, had only 70 such students, while these schools enrolled\na total of 2831 Anglo students. (See als\n 1/ -\n\nwhich Anderson was located and McCallum - which served the\nnorthern part of the district. For the 1955-56 school year\nand thereafter, Anderson was given a zone which traced the\nblack residential area in East Austin. (Tr. pp. 341-42)\nThis zone which commenced at the eastern edge of the school\ndistrict was an irregular, elongated zone approximately one\nmile wide from north to south and extended approximately four\nmiles westward into the center of the Austin zone, which\nZL/\nbordered it on three sides.(cid:9) Simultaneously, the school\nboard adopted a free transfer policy which applied only to\nthe Anderson school. Under this policy, the students zoned\ninto Anderson were allowed to transfer out to traditionally\nwhite schools and students living outside the zone were\nallowed to transfer into Anderson. (Gov't. Ex. 7-A, Board\nMinutes, Aug. 8, 1955) This transfer policy was not dis-\ncontinued until 1969. only one white student attended\n26/ See map, Appendix B to this brief.\n- 18 -\n\nY\n27/\nAnderson prior to the 1969-70 school year.+\nDesegregation of grades below the tenth grade progressed\non a grade-a-year basis starting in the 1958-59 school year.\nA zone line for the traditionally black Kealing Junior High\nwas established which was identical to that for Anderson High.\nBlack junior high school students who wished to transfer to\ntraditionally \"white\" schools were limited in their options to\nthe University Junior High or Allan Junior High depending on\nwhere in the Kealing zone the transferring student resided.\nBy this time the enrollment at Allan was predominantly Mexican-\nAmerican. Like the high school level, free transfer into\nv/ School census figures for 1955-56 (Gov't. Ex. 3-C) show\nthat approximately 71 Anglo and 27 Mexican-American high school\nage students resided in the Winn Elementary zone, which for the\nmost part was within the Anderson zone. One hundred and four\nAnglo and 99 Mexican-American high school age children resided\nin the Govalle Elementary zone, part of which was in the\nAnderson zone. Yet only one white child attended Anderson\nbetween 1955 and 1969 (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information\non Integration) At the same time black students from outside\nEast Austin transferred to Anderson. For example, in 1955-56\nthere were 63 black high school students in the St. Johns\nElementary area, located in the McCallum High School zone.\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-C) The first year there is any record of a\nNegro attending McCallum is 1969-70 when there was one Negro\nout of a total enrollment of 1928. (Gov't. Ex. 2)\n- 19 -\n\nf\ni\n^a\ni\nKealing was permitted, and this policy was not discontinued(cid:9) I'\n28/\nuntil 1969.(cid:9) Kealing, like Anderson, has remained virtually\nall black. (Gov't. Ex. 7-E, Background Information).\nElementary students first began desegregating in 1961\nwith the sixth grade, and by 1963 students in all six ele-\nmentary grades were allowed to attend formerly all-white schools\nin their zone. (Gov't. Ex. 7-B, Minutes, July 10, 1961) In\n1964 the defendants still maintained two sets of maps of zone\nlines, one for formerly white schools and one for formerly\n(cid:9)\nblack schools. (Gov't. Ex. 9-C and 9-D) Black stu-\ndents from Sims could only transfer to Ortega, which by 1967-68\nwas 50% black, 457 Mexican-American and 57 Anglo; di-\nrectly north of Sims was Pecan Springs (897. Anglo, 8% black\nand 3% Mexican-American in 1967-68) to which they could not\ntransfer. Students from Blackshear could only attend Palm\nJ/ Gov't. Ex. 7-B, Minutes, July 14, 1958. Under this policy\nblacks from outside the Kealing zone continued to transfer to\nKealing. For example, Pearce Junior High opened in 1958 with\nan enrollment of 295 Anglos and 3 Mexican Americans. Black\njunior high students from the St. Johns community continued to\ntransfer to Kealing under the transfer policy even though the\nSt. Johns area was within the Pearce zone.\n- 20 -\n\nI\n(96% Mexican-American in 1967-68), Metz (98% Mexican-American)\nor Zavala (96% Mexican-American) while Pease Elementary, di-\nrectly east of Blackshear, was 857.

In 1961, when blacks first began to transfer, Winn\nhad 161 Anglo and 96 Mexican-American elementary students. By\n1967-68 Winn was 63% black and 28% Mexican American. A new\nWinn opened in extreme northeast Austin in 1970-71 with a 947.\nAnglo enrollment.\n30/ See Gov't. Ex. 9-E. In addition between 1961 and 1965\nthree small black schools (approximately 60-65 students) were\nclosed: Montopolis (1961); Brakenridge (1965); Clarksville\n(1965). When Montopolis was closed its students were sent\nacross the Colorado River to the all-black Sims Elementary\nuntil all grades were allowed to integrate, when they were\nassigned to the predominantly Mexican American Allison Ele-\nmentary School. (Gov't. Ex. 3-D shows that in 1963-64, 455\nMexican American and 114 Anglo elementary students resided in\nthis area.) Brackenridge students were reassigned to Becker\nElementary, also predominantly Mexican-American. (Gov't. Ex.\n3-E shows 426 Mexican-Americans and 298 Anglos in this area\nin 1965-66.) Clarksville students were reassigned to Mathews\nElementary (411 Anglos and 137 Mexican Americans in 1965-66).\n(Gov't. Ex. 3-E)\n- 21 -\n\nNot until 1969-70 were black elementary students given free\nchoice to attend any school in the district. (Gov't. Ex.\n7-H, Minutes, July 14, 1969) Nonetheless, the elementary\nzone map of today shows that four of the six black schools\nin East Austin still have zones which overlap with one or\n31/\nmore Mexican-American schools. (Def' t. Ex. 11)^\nD. Construction Policy Since 1950\nAfter World War II the AISD was faced with a shortage\nof school capacity, due to the increased student population\nand the absence of any construction in the district since\n1940. In 1950 it embarked on a continuous construction pro-\ngram which has resulted in the opening of 36 new elementary,\n32/\n9 new junior high and 7 new high schools. (Def't. Ex. 13)\n31/ Campbell's zone had overlapped with Winn; with the closing\nof Winn in 1969, Campbell now has its own zone. Norman, which\nopened in 1970 east of Sims, also has its own zone.\n32/ In 1950, 89% of the district's Mexican American student\npopulation and 937 of the blacks lived in East Austin.\n- 22 -\n\n2\nIn picking the sites for these schools, the defendants\nconsider capacity and neighborhood need, and claim that race\nand ethnic origin are not taken into account. (Tr. pp. 453-\n54) However, one of the major uses of the census material\nkept by the district is to study trends and projections of\npopulation concentration, growth and movement for purposes\nof planning a building program. (Tr._.329.-.3 Q) The census\nhas traditionally enumerated the number of black students\nin the district, and in 1948 and thereafter, the census\nfigures divided the \"white\" students into \"Anglo-American\"\nand \"Latin-American\" student categories.\nMuch of this construction interacted with changes in\nstudent assignment policies adopted following the Brown de-\ncision in 1954. On the high school level, only one \"white\"\nhigh school (Austin) was operated until 1953. In that year two\nhigh schools -- McCallum in North Austin and Travis in South\nAustin -- opened; Austin High then served all white students\na/See Ir Z2-28; Gov't Exs. 2, 3.(cid:9) This was one year after\nthe Gubbels' Report (Def.

In\naddition, the Gubbels' Report had recommended a new junior-\nsenior high school site in East Austin with a zone including\nall of East Austin and a predominantly Anglo area north of\n—34/\nthe University to 45th Street.  However, in 1955, before\nthis school had been built, the defendants drew a zone for\nthe traditionally black Anderson High School which encompassed\n35,\nthe black neighborhood.

Elementary Schools\nThe defendants' plan as approved by the district\ncourt assigns all students initially by the same\nzone lines that were maintained in 1970-71, except for the St.\nJohns school, and which will result in approximately the\nsame degree of racial and ethnic separation that existed\n58/\nin 1970-71.(cid:9) In addition, the plan has organized six clusters\n.U/ \nThe defendants submitted projected zone lines for these\nschools (Def.

Blacks who will be non-contiguously zoned to three\nhigh schools and five junior high schools are rezoned to Johnston,\nAllan and Martin. Under this rezoning 3 high schools and 7 junior\nhigh schools would be 97% Anglo (Def.

These activities will\nconsist of (1) visits to \"learning resource centers\" which\nwill be established at the former black secondary schools\nwhich have been closed (Anderson and Kealing) and at a\nclosed elementary school (Baker); (2) inter-site visits in\nwhich students of grade level will meet at one of the\nschools in the cluster; and (3) field trips involving all\nstudents from a cluster. These integrated activities will\ncover four curriculum areas -- fine arts, social studies,\nsciences and vocational courses. During the integrated\nactivities students will be assigned to small instructional\ngroups of 6-8 students and will include black, Anglo and\nMexican-American students.

(Tr. 944)\n- 37 -\n\nDISCUSSION\nIntroduction\nThis case raises difficult questions which, because\nof their importance, we feel obliged to present to this\nCourt. What is the relief required by Swann v. Board of\nEducation, 402 U.S. 1 as to the eradication of Austin's old\ndual system of segregation of white from black? What facts\nestablish a case of illegal discrimination in assignment of\nMexican-American and Anglo students in the white part of the\ndual system? If there has been an illegal separation of\nMexican American from Anglo as well as black from white,\nwhat is the appropriate remedy?\nAppellate review of the case is rendered difficult\nby a combination of circumstances. In spite of the lengthy\nrecord and the specificity of the proof (largely based upon\nofficial records rather than witness testimony) the district\ncourt did not make specific findings of fact but instead\nmade general recitations mixing findings of ultimate fact\nwith conclusions of law. Because of this it is often not\npossible to tell what legal standards were followed in assessing\n- 38 -\n\nthe facts or even which alleged facts were accepted as true\nand which were rejected as false. Second, the district\ncourt had before it remedies which it apparently judged\ninappropriate; therefore, it initially declined to order\neither the board plan or the HEW plan into effect. Ulti-\nmately the court elected to order into effect one inappro-\npriate remedy rather than the other. It seems clear to us\nthat a new remedy must be fashioned, but that cannot be\ndone until the nature and extent of discrimination against\nMexican-Americans has been determined.\nI. MEXICAN-AMERICANS AS A RACIAL OR ETHNIC CLASS\nUNDER BROWN\nThe district court was clearly correct in\nfinding that Mexican-Americans are a separate ethnic\nminority in Austin and thus a group entitled to the equal pro-\ntection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hernandez v.\nTexas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954); Alvarado v. El Paso Independent School\nDistrict, No. 71-1555 (5th Cir., decided June 16, 1971);\n- 39 -\n\ncf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Yick\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886). This finding\nwas made on the basis of many of these decisions, on the\ndefendants' appointment of a tri-ethnic committee, on\ntestimony of the defendants' Superintendent, and \"by even\nthe most casual examination of Mexican-American culture.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p.2) In\naddition, the AISD's historical maintenance of \"Mexican\"\nschools, their enumeration of Mexican-Americans in compiling\n61l Many earlier decisions have established this principle\nin school desegregation cases.

Presently pending on appeal before this Court are\ntwo other cases which have made the same finding. Cisneros\nand United States v. Corpus Christi Independent School District,\n324 F. Supp. 599 (S.D. Tex. 1970) (No. 71-2367 on appeal);\nTasby v. Estes, C. A. No. 3-4211-C (N.D. Tex., July 16, 1971)\n(No. 71-2581 on appeal). And see Mr. Justice Douglas' comments\nin denying a stay for Chinese students of a school desegregation\norder in San Francisco: \"Brown v. Board of Education was not\nwritten for Blacks alone ... The theme of our school desegre-\ngation cases extends to all racial minorities treated invidiously\nby a State or any of its agencies.\" Lee v. Johnson, No. A-203\n(Douglas, Circuit Justice, August 25, 1971).\n- 40 -\n\n9\ncensus statistics, and their more recent recognition of\ncitizens' groups representing the Mexican-American community\n62 /\nreinforce this finding.\nII. PRE-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nAs the district court noted, prior to 1955 the de-\nfendants \"maintained a dual school system with educational\nopportunities separate and inherently unequal for blacks.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 3) This\nsystem was characterized by overlapping attendance zones\nand complete segregation of black students and black faculty\nat all grade levels in the system. The defendant school\ndistrict thus fell squarely within the command of Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), 349 U.S. 294 (1955),\nand was under an affirmative duty to eliminate \"all vestiges\nof state-imposed segregation.\" Swann v. Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).\nWe start from the fact that neither the State of\nTexas nor the defendants have ever officially required the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in schools. There\n62' Gov't. Ex. 3; 6-J, 6-K.\n- 41 -\n\nis evidence, however, that some of the pre-Brown practices\nand policies with regard to Mexican-Americans in Austin\nwere similar to the discriminatory student assignment\npolicies traditionally applied to black students.\nThe district court noted the pre-Brown existence of\nsome schools designated as \"Mexican\" schools, with all\nMexican-American enrollments and attendance zones which\noverlapped with predominantly Anglo schools, but it none-\ntheless found that these schools were not \"built for the\npurpose of discriminating against, isolating or segregating\nstudents on the basis of Mexican-American ethnic origin.\"\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, fn. 12(c))\nfinding \nWe think this  is erroneous in view of the court's\nown finding, and the record in this case. The evidence\nshows that the defendants created and maintained, at various\ntimes prior to 1954, three such schools in the system with\n63/\nzones overlapping Anglo school zones.(cid:9) The creation and\nmaintenance of overlapping or \"optional\" attendance zones\n63/ These were the West Avenue School, the Comal Street School,\nand the Zavala School, which replaced the Comal Street School\nwhen it opened in 1936. The Zavala School was built to meet\nthe need of the Mexican-American population \"as near the center\nof this population as possible,\" and parts of the school curri-\nculum were designed for junior high age Mexican-American migrant\nstudents who were still attending elementary school. See pp.10-14.\nsupra.\n- 42 -\n\n0\nis constitutional only if it does not encourage or preserve\nsegregation. See Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683,\n686 (1963); Monroe v. Board of School Commissioners, 391 U.S.\n450, 458-59 (1968); Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401,\n415-17 (D.D.C. 1967); aff'd sub nom Smuck v. Hobson, 408\nF.2d 175, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1969). In addition, the court\noverlooked uncontroverted evidence showing the discriminatory\nassignment of Mexican-American elementary students to the\nBickler school in 1939 after Anglo parents had objected\nto the assignment of these students to the predominantly\n64/\nAnglo Winn school.\nFinally, the court ignored uncontroverted evidence\nthat when the dual zone for Zavala and Metz was eliminated\nin 1954, the new zone line was drawn on Third Street, immediately\nadjacent to the Zavala school, with the result that Zavala\nremained virtually all Mexican-American. Discrimination in\nthe drawing of zone lines in a school system purportedly\nfit/ \nBy 1947 all elementary age students at Bickler were\nMexican-American. During this same period, the school board\nfailed to act on a request of the Mexican consul in 1944 to\neliminate the segregation situation at the Zavala and Metz\nschools. See pp. 15-16 , supra.\n- 43 -\n\nfollowing a neighborhood school policy has been held un-\nlawful. See,., Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate\nSchool System, 409 F.2d 682 (5th Cir. 1969); United States v.\nSchool District 151, 404 F.2d ll25 j7th_Cir.1968); United States v.\nBoard of Education, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 429 F.2d 1253 (10th Cir.1970).\nIII. POST-BROWN DISCRIMINATION\nThe district court found that defendants have not\ndiscriminated against black or Mexican-American students\nsince Brown II. As to blacks, the court ruled that relief\nwas required to eradicate the vestiges of the pre-1955 dual\nsystem. For that reason, on appellate review the main\nissue is whether the district court's holding as to Mexican-\nAmericans was correct.\nWe would agree that the record might support a\nfinding that defendants did not engage in a purposeful\nsystematic program intended to discriminate against all\n5/ Nonetheless, we think the record requires reversal of\nthe finding that defendants have not discriminated against\nblacks since 1955. Such a finding is inconsistent with the\ncontinued maintenance of dual, overlapping zones, the building\nof the under-sized all-black St. Johns school surrounded by\nthree white schools, the selection of other elementary school\nsites in areas where the new schools constructed would be\nall-black, the construction of additions to predominantly\none-race schools adjacent to schools serving opposite race\nstudents, the continuation of faculty segregation, and the\ndrawing of secondary school attendance zone lines intended\nto segregate.\n- 44 -\n\nMexican-American students. Indeed, as to some predominantly\nMexican-American schools there is no proof of discrimination.\nBut the district court failed to find specific facts as\nto the cause of the undoubted isolation of minority group\nstudents in most of East Austin, in spite of a voluminous\nrecord demonstrating that defendants knew their actions\nwould further separate Mexican-American students from Anglo\nstudents.\nIn the years immediately before and after Brown,\ndefendants took the following actions which increased the\nsegregation of Mexican-American students in East Austin:\n(a) The construction of three secondary\nschools attended predominantly by Mexican-\nAmerican students and simultaneous abandonment\nof two centrally-located secondary schools\nin which Anglo and Mexican-American students would\nhave remained integrated.\n(b) In some instances the drawing of zone\nlines and creation of optional zones to minimize\nthe number of Anglo students in minority group\nschools and the number of minority group students\nin Anglo schools. The most notable example is\nthe Martin Junior High School zone.\nSuch evidence would not, of itself, establish discrimination.\nIf the defendants lumped Anglo and Mexican-American students\ntogether for all purposes as \"white\" students, the evidence\n- 45 -\n\nwould merely reflect that some white schools were built in\nEast Austin and some in other parts of Austin. But the\nevidence shows that defendants considered the Mexican-\nAmericans a separate ethnic group, and the inference\ntherefore could be made that some construction and zone\ndrawing were affected by the distinction. In 1948,\nafter the Mexican-American student population had grown and\n66/\nthe Mexican-American drop-out rate had begun its decline,\nthe defendants changed their student census from an\nenumeration of blacks and whites to an enumeration of\nblacks, Anglos, and Mexican-Americans.(cid:9) Since school\nconstruction needs and zone line changes were projected\nlargely on the basis of the census data, this change in\n66/ In 1933-34 only 3% of the \"white\" secondary students were\nMexican-American; in 1970-71 this number had increased to 20%.\nThe number of Mexican-American secondary students likewise\nincreased from 88 to 4286 in the same period. (See Def. Exs.\n69,79)\n67/ This change in administrative practice occurred in 1948,\nalmost simultaneously with the completion of a twenty-year\nprojection of school construction plans which has guided much\nof defendants' construction activities since 1950. See Def.\nEx. 91 (The Gubbels' Report), and p. 23, -supra.(cid:9) The\nenumeration of \"Latin-Americans\" was, according to the testimony,\nbegun as a \"research project\" and continued because it was\n\"very interesting and revealing.\" (Tr. pp. 327-28)\n- 46 -\n\noperation provided the means for considering the ethnic\nimpact of construction and zone drawing decisions. Cf.\nAvery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 562 (1953); Whitus v. Georgia,\n385 U.S. 545, 552 (1967). Further, defendants admittedly\ntook race and ethnic origin into account in drawing certain\nof the zone lines during this period. Compare the rationale\nfor separating blacks and Mexican-Americans on the high\nschool level (\"insecurity and competition economically\n68/\namong the ... 'Negro' and 'Latin-American'...'')(cid:9) with\nthe rationale for gerrymandering black students into Martin\n[and presumably Allan] Junior High Schools instead of the\nnearer, predominantly Anglo Baker Junior High (integrating\n69 /\n\"white\" and black students).

Eckels, 434 F.2d 1140, 1150\n70/\n(5th Cir. 1970) (Clark, J. dissenting).\nThe task of this Court, then, is to assess the probative\neffect of these inferences on the outcome of this appeal; or,\nin the alternative, to remand for further hearing and findings\nby the district court.\nIn finding no de jure discrimination, the court below\napparently referred only to the testimony adduced below, and\nignored the voluminous documentary evidence introduced into\nthe record. The law is well-settled that inferences of dis-\ncrimination may be drawn from such documentary evidence,\nand they may be conclusive despite testimony of racial\nneutrality by responsible officials. See, e.g., Hernandez\nv. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 481-82 (1954); Turner v. Fouche,\n396 U.S. 346, 360-61 (1970), and cases cited therein in notes\n20-22; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 598 (1935); Keyes v.\n70/ In considering possible remedies, the district court\nstated that the \"burden\" of desegregation of blacks should not\nbe placed solely on Mexican-Americans, and announced that this\nshould be a consideration in preparing desegregation plans.\n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, June 28, 1971, p. 6)\n- 48 -\n\nSchool District No. 1, 303 F. Supp. 279, 313 F. Supp. 61\n(D. Colo. 1969), aff'd(cid:9) - F. 2d(cid:9) (No. 336-70, decided\nJune 11, 1971); Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; United States v. School District 151, supra.\nThe impact of these and other inferences should be\nconsidered and decided by this Court, especially should\nit decide to remand for further proceedings below. Some\nof the questions discussed herein as well as other related\n11/\nissues, have been considered by Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nbut they are generally questions of first impression for this\nCourt. Therefore, we think it appropriate for this Court\nto consider the need for specific criteria of evidentiary\nanalysis to be applied by district courts facing these\nsituations. The need for such criteria is emphasized by a\ncomparison of the decision of the court below in this case\nwith the decision of the district court in Cisneros v.\nCorpus Christi Independent School District, 324 F. Supp. 599\n121\n(S.D. Texas 1970), which is also on appeal to this Court.\nj1 \t e.g., \nDavis v. School Board of City of Pontiac,\nsupra; Keyes v. School District No. 1, supra; United States\nV. School District 151, supra; Taylor v. Boarder Education,\n294 F. 2d 36 (2nd Cir. 1969).\nj/ Appeal No. 71-2397.\n- 49 -\n\nAlthough district courts sit as courts of equity in these\ncases, with broad powers, some degree of detail and\nspecificity is necessary to evaluate the evidence of\ndiscrimination, just as some guidelines are necessary for\na determination of questions of relief. Cf. Swann v.\nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 6, 26 (1971).\nIV. THE RELIEF\nIn fashioning relief for this case, the district\ncourt had before it two desegregation plans drawn and\nsubmitted prior to the presentation of the facts at trial\nconcerning the nature and extent of discrimination within\nthe Austin School System. The HEW plan, which was prepared\nin response to the district court order of September 4, 1970\nto make a comprehensive study and prepare a plan \"which will\ncompletely disestablish a dual school system,\" was based\non the assumption that de 'lure discrimination against both\nblacks and Mexican-Americans existed system-wide; consequently,\nit was drawn to eliminate the ethnic and racial identifiability\nof every school in the system. It also adopted on a full-time\nbasis the cluster system for elementary schools which defen-\ndants had adopted on a part-time basis. The plan submitted\n- 50 -\n\nby the defendants apparently assumed that no de jure dis-\n73 /\ncrimination had ever been practiced against Mexican-Americans,\nand that only vestiges of the dual school system which had\nbeen maintained for blacks prior to 1955 remained.\nThe district court's June 28, 1971 opinion found that\nthe evidence in the case supported defendants' assumption\nand accordingly its subsequent remedial order of July 19,\n1971 approved the defendants' plan. We agree that the scope\nof the remedy ordered in cases of this kind ought to be\nconsistent with the nature of the violation. But here the\ndistrict court's findings as to the quantum of officially-\nimposed discrimination are erroneous both as to blacks and\nMexican-Americans. Since it now appears that the evidence\nas to de jure discrimination against Mexican-Americans does\nnot extend to all Mexican-American schools as assumed by the\nHEW plan, a remand to the district court to consider the ex-\ntent of the relief warranted in this case appears proper. The\nfollowing discussion is submitted for the Court's considera-\ntion as to the direction that such an inquiry might take.\n73/ Defendants' plan did include Mexican-American schools in\nits elementary desegregation plan; it did so for educational\npurposes, not as a matter of constitutional duty. Tr. pp.799-800.\n- 51 -\n\nA. BLACK SCHOOLS\nThe facts in this case establish a formerly state-\nimposed dual school system which was never disestablished.\nWhile the district court plan eliminates all secondary schools\nidentifiable as black schools, the elementary school plan\ninitially assigns black students to schools in the same\nmanner as during 1970-71 (which still include some dual over-\nlapping zones with predominantly Mexican-American schools).\n74/\nPart-time desegregation is provided for 16% of the time.\nWhile this may have much to commend it educationally, standing\nalone it does not eradicate the dual system. See Bivins v.\nBibb County Board of Education, 424 F.2d 97 (5th Cir. 1970).\nThe district court distinguishes this case from Bibb on\nits facts, stating that the defendants' plan \"encompasses\nvirtually all of the system's Anglo elementary students\nfor a much larger portion of their academic time in a\nfar wider and more meaningful range of multi-cultural ex-\nperiences.\" (Memorandum Opinion and Order, July 19, 1971,\n74 / Computed by multiplying the percent of school days (25%)\nspent in integrated classes by the percent of each such day\nin such classes (4-1/2 of each 7 hours; or 64%).\n- 52 -\n\np. 8) Yet, the initial discriminatory assignment of students\nunder this plan will govern at least 8 of their learning\n141. \nexperience. In the context of this case where each black\nschool in the system was created and has been maintained at\nall times as an all-black school, such a P' lan can hardly be\nsaid to meet the school board's duty to take 'whatever steps\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination is eliminated root and branch.\" Green\nv. New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968). On remand\nthe district court should consider other approaches to desegre-\ngating the black elementary schools.\nB. MEXICAN-ANERICAN \nSCHOOLS\nThe evidence in this case reveals that the nature of\nthe defendants' constitutional violation with regards to\nMexican-Americans does not permeate the entire school system.\nTherefore, the Court should decide at which schools there\nis proof of discrimination and should limit its relief to\neradicating the effects of that discrimination.\n- 53 -\n\nC ONC LUS ION\nFor the above reasons, the case should be reversed\nand remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWILLIAM SESSIONS(cid:9) DAVID L.
