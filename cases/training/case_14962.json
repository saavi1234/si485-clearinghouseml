Continental Southern Lines, Inc., is a common\ncarrier by motor vehicle engaged in the transportation of\npassengers in interstate commerce to, from and through\nShreveport, Louisiana. The Interstate Commerce Commission\nhas issued to Continental Southern Lines, Inc., a certificate\nof public convenience and necessity authorizing and requiring\nit to provide transportation cf passengers, baggage, express,\n\nmail and newspapers in interstate com rce to and from Shreve-\n•\nport. In the discharge of its obligation under this certi\"\nficate and for the comfort and convenience of its passengers,\nContinental Southern Lines, Inc., uses a passenger terminal\nin Shreveport known as the Trailways Bus terminal. The\nterminal is owned •and operated by Trans-Continental Bus\nTerminals, Inc. In the terminal a rest_iurant is maintained\nand operated by Continental Restaurants, Inc. providing food\nand service for the passengers of Continental Southern Lines,\nInc., and others. Continental Southern Lines, Inc., Trana-\nContinental Bus Terminals, Inc., and Continental Restaurants,\nInc., are all subsidiaries of Transcontinental Bus Systems,\nInc.\n2. On September 22, 1961, the Interstate Commerce\nCommission entered its order in a proceeding entitled \"Dis-\ncrimination in Operations of Interstate Motor Carriers of\nPassengers,\" Docket No. MC-C-3358, adding Section 180(a) to\nTitle 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The regulations\nset forth in Section 180(a) became effective on November 1,\n1961, and provide, among other things, that no common carrier\nby motor vehicle in interstate commerce shall, in the opera-\ntion of its vehicles in interstate commerce, provide, maintain\narrangements for, utilize, make available, or adhere to any\nunderstanding for the availability of, any terminal facilities\nwhich are so operated, arranged, or maintained as to involve\nany separation of any portion thereof or in the use thereof\non the basis of race or color. The regulations further provide\n\nthat the term 'term n facilities\" includes waiting room,\nrestroom, eating, drinking and ticket sales facilities which\nthe carrier makes available to passengers of a motor vehicle\noperated in interstate commerce as a regular part of its\ntransportation, and that the term \"separation\" \nincludes the\ndisplay of any sign indicating that any portions of the ter-\nminal facilities are operated, allocated, restricted, provided,\navailable, used or otherwise distinguished on the basis of race\nor color.\n3. On October 31, 1961, the defendants J. Earl Downs,\nCommissioner of Public Safety of the City of Shreveport, J.\nHowell Flournoy, Sheriff of Caddo Parish, and James M. Goslin,\nChief Deputy Sheriff of Caddo Parish, contacted Hugh B. Walmsley,\nManager of the Trailways Bus terminal, and advised him that the\nlaws of Louisiana require that signs be posted designating\nseparate facilities at the terminal for Negroes and whites.\nDespite this warning, Mr. Walmsley on the same day removed from\nthe terminal certain signs which had previously designated\nseparate waiting room, restroom, ticket sales, and restaurant\nand Negro \nfacilities for the separate use of the white  races.\n4. On November 1, 1961, the District Attorney of Caddo\nParish, instituted a prosecution of Mr. Walmsley for violation\nof Louisiana Revised Statute, Title 45, Section 1302, which\nrequires the posting of signs in bus terminals to designate\nfacilities for the  Negroes.\nseparate  separate use of whites and \nreleased. The\nMr. Walmsley posted a bond of $250.00 and was \nprosecution of it has been aban-\ncharge is still pending, but \ndoned since the statute upon which it was based has been\n\ndeclared unconstitutional.\n5. On January 25, 1962, this court, sitting as a\nspecial statutory court of three judges, decided the case of\nUnited States v. Lassiter, Civil Action No. 8567 (203 F. Supp.\n20), declaring Louisiana Revised Statute, Title 45, Section\n1302, to be unconstitutional. This decision was affirmed by\nthe Supreme Court on October 8, 1962.\n6. Since November 1, 1961, the Police Department of\nthe City of Shreveport has enforced racial segregation of\npersons using the Trailways Bus Terminal. This has been done\nby officers stationed at the terminal who, pursuant to the\ndirections of their superiors, have forbidden Negroes to enter\nthe main waiting room of the terminal or to use the restaurant\nfacilities connecting with the main waiting room. Negroes\nwho have entered the main waiting room and its restaurant\nfacilities before being so forbidden have been ordered to\nleave. Negroes who have ignored the warnings and the orders\nof the officers have been arrested. Racial segregation has been\nenforced by these means both with respect to passengers in\ninterstate commerce and to other persons. The evidence fails\nto establish that the Sheriff of Caddo Parish or his Chief\nDeputy have participated in this enforcement of segregation\nat the terminal since November 1, 1961.\n7. It appears from the evidence that the Police\nDepartment of the City of Shreveport will continue to enforce\nracial segregation unless the defendant City and its officials\nare restrained by order of this court. The defendant Teasley,\nChief of Police of the City of Shreveport, has stated that his\n\norders to his offiders are to enforce segregation at the\nterminal and that these orders will stand at least until\nthis, court should order otherwise.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n1. This court has jurisdiction of this action under\n28 U.S.C. 1345 and 49 U.S.C. 43.\n2. The Attorney General has standing to bring this\nsuit in the name of the United States to restrain and remove\nan unconstitutional interference with and burden upon interstate\ncommerce. United States v. Lassiter, 203 F. Supp. 20 0, .n. t.^.\n1962), affirmed(cid:9) U.S.  (cid:9) (October 8, 1962, 31\nL.W. 3.15), and cases cited therein.\n3. The United States Attorney, whenever the Attorney\nGeneral shall direct, is authorized to institute a proceeding\nfor equitable relief against discriminations forbidden by the\nstatutes relating to interstate commerce. 49 U.S.C. 43:\nUnited States v. Lassiter, supra.\n4.

Upon the evidence now before the court the plaintiff\nis not entitled to an injunction against J. Howell Flournoy,\nSheriff of Caddo Parish, nor James M. Goslin, Chief Deputy\nSheriff of Caddo Parish, and the complaint is dismissed as to\nthem.\nDECREE\nIT IS ORDERED that the City of Shreveport, Clyde Fant,\nJ.Earl Downs, and Harvey D. Teasley, together with their\nsuccessors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,\nand all persons in active concert or participation with them\nbe and they hereby are permanently enjoined:\n(a) From enforcing racial segregation in,\nor requiring the separate use on the basis of race of\nthe \nany of  facilities of the Trailways Bus\nin Shreveport, Louisiana;\nTerminal \n(b) Arbitrarily and without legal justi-\nfication arresting or detaining or threatening\nto arrest or detain persons who are using or\nto use the facilities of \nattempting  the Trail-\nways Bus Terminal without racial segregation,\nand\n\n(c) Interfering in any way or by any\nmeans with compliance by Continental Southern\nLines, Inc., Trans-Continental Bus Terminals,\nRestaurants, Inc., with\nInc., and Continental \nUnited \nthe laws of the  States and the regula-\ntions of the Interstate Commerce Commission pro-\nhibiting racial discrimination in the facilities\nof interstate commerce.\nNothing in this order shall prevent the City of Shreve-\nport from stationing such officers of its Police Department\nat the Trailways Bus Terminal as may be necessary to preserve\nLouisiana and the\norder and enforce the laws of the State of \nordinances of the City of Shreveport in a manner not incon-\nsistent with the foregoing provisions of this decree.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant City of\nShreveport pay the costs of this suit.\nSigned and effective November 16, 1962.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nSHREVEPORT DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nvs.\t )\t CIVIL ACTION\nNO. 8845-S\nCITY OF SHREVEPORT, et A1.,(cid:9) )\nDefendants.)\n1\nFINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND DECREE\nThis case having come on for hearing this day upon\nthe plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, and the\nplaintiff and each of the defendants being represented by\ncounsel, the court having received evidence and heard argu-\nment upon the motion, and all parties having stipulated that\nthe evidence and argument might be considered by the Court\nin connection with the granting or denial of permanent in-\njunctive relief, the court now enters its findings of fact,\nconclusions of law and final decree as follows:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1.

The\nMr. Walmsley posted a bond of $250.00 and was \nprosecution of it has been aban-\ncharge is still pending, but \ndoned since the statute upon which it was based has been\n\ndeclared unconstitutional.\n5. On January 25, 1962, this court, sitting as a\nspecial statutory court of three judges, decided the case of\nUnited States v. Lassiter, Civil Action No. 8567 (203 F. Supp.\n20), declaring Louisiana Revised Statute, Title 45, Section\n1302, to be unconstitutional. This decision was affirmed by\nthe Supreme Court on October 8, 1962.\n6. Since November 1, 1961, the Police Department of\nthe City of Shreveport has enforced racial segregation of\npersons using the Trailways Bus Terminal. This has been done\nby officers stationed at the terminal who, pursuant to the\ndirections of their superiors, have forbidden Negroes to enter\nthe main waiting room of the terminal or to use the restaurant\nfacilities connecting with the main waiting room. Negroes\nwho have entered the main waiting room and its restaurant\nfacilities before being so forbidden have been ordered to\nleave. Negroes who have ignored the warnings and the orders\nof the officers have been arrested. Racial segregation has been\nenforced by these means both with respect to passengers in\ninterstate commerce and to other persons. The evidence fails\nto establish that the Sheriff of Caddo Parish or his Chief\nDeputy have participated in this enforcement of segregation\nat the terminal since November 1, 1961.\n7. It appears from the evidence that the Police\nDepartment of the City of Shreveport will continue to enforce\nracial segregation unless the defendant City and its officials\nare restrained by order of this court. The defendant Teasley,\nChief of Police of the City of Shreveport, has stated that his\n\norders to his offiders are to enforce segregation at the\nterminal and that these orders will stand at least until\nthis, court should order otherwise.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n1. This court has jurisdiction of this action under\n28 U.S.C. 1345 and 49 U.S.C. 43.\n2. The Attorney General has standing to bring this\nsuit in the name of the United States to restrain and remove\nan unconstitutional interference with and burden upon interstate\ncommerce.

Lassiter, supra.\n4. Enforcement by the City of Shreveport and its\nPolice Department of racial segregation in the facilities of\nthe Trailways Bus Terminal imposes an undue burden upon inter-\nstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of Article\n1, Section 8 of the Constitution...

This decision was affirmed  United States v. Lassiter, supra. \nby the Supreme Court on October 8, 1962.    \n6. Since November 1, 1961, the Police Department of the  5.
