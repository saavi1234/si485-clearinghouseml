    "summary": "<p>On June 11, 2015, Gavin Grimm, a sixteen-year-old transgender boy filed this lawsuit against the Gloucester County School Board in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiff, represented by the national and Virginia ACLU, proceeded under Title IX and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. He sought a preliminary and permanent injunction allowing him to use the boys' restroom at school, claiming that the school board's policy of requiring transgender students to use a private restroom facility violated his rights under Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that after he had used the boys' restroom with the school's permission for seven weeks without incident, the school board released a policy stating that students' access to restrooms was restricted based on their \"biological gender\" and that students who were unable to use the corresponding restroom because of \"gender identity issues\" were to use an alternative private facility. At the time, plaintiff was the only student at the school required to use the private facility.</p>\r\n<p>The ACLU had previously filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on December 18, 2014, only days after the school board instituted the restroom policy. The ACLU's complaint stated that the school board's behavior was a violation of Title IX in that discrimination based on a person's transgender status is discrimination based on sex. Additionally, the complaint alleged that, since there had never been any complaints regarding the plaintiff, any privacy concerns were nothing more than irrational prejudice or stigma against transgender people.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2015, the court (Judge Robert Doumar) denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Then on September 17, 2015, the court also granted the school board's motion to dismiss. The school board argued that discrimination based on gender identity is not sex discrimination, and therefore, not covered under Title IX. The court agreed, ruling that the plaintiff failed to state a valid claim under Title IX because schools are permitted to keep separate restrooms based on sex as long as the restrooms are comparable. The court also explained that it had denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction on the basis that allowing him to use the boys' restroom would violate other students' constitutional right to privacy. 132 F.Supp.3d 736.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed the court's denial of the preliminary injunction. In the Fourth Circuit, on October 28, 2015, the DOJ filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiff's appeal. The DOJ, citing a letter issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), took the position that discrimination based on transgender status constitutes discrimination based on sex, denying a student access to the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity denies the student equal educational opportunity, and general invocations of privacy and safety do not override Title IX's prohibition on sex-based discrimination. This marked the first time the administration took this position in an appeals court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2016, the Fourth Circuit reversed and vacated in part the district court&rsquo;s ruling. The circuit court found that Title IX is ambiguous on how gender should be determined for purposes of finding impermissible sex discrimination. The court also found that the DOE&rsquo;s interpretation of Title IX, which required schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity, was the result of the agency&rsquo;s fair and considered judgment, and was neither a convenient litigating position nor a post hoc rationalization. Based on those findings, the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment to the school board, finding that the DOE&rsquo;s interpretation was entitled to deference. The Fourth Circuit further found that the district court had improperly excluded evidence in deciding whether to grant the plaintiff preliminary injunctive relief. The Fourth Circuit then remanded the question of whether to grant the plaintiff injunctive relief with instructions to consider the improperly excluded evidence. 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff had also asked for the case to be reassigned to a different judge on remand. He argued that various statements by Judge Doumar expressing opinions about medical facts and gender dysphoria indicated that the judge had pre-existing views that he would be unwilling to set aside in the face of contrary evidence about gender and sexuality. The Fourth Circuit denied reassignment, finding that there was insufficient evidence that Judge Doumar would refuse to consider and credit sound contrary evidence, and that his methods were idiosyncratic but not fundamentally unfair.</p>\r\n<p>On May 31, 2016, the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc; it also denied a stay of its mandate. 824 F.3d 450 (4th Cir. 2016).</p>\r\n<p>On remand, on June 23, 2016, the district court issued an order granting the plaintiff a preliminary injunction allowing him to use the boys' restroom. The court, noting that the plaintiff had not asked for access to the boys' locker rooms, specified that the preliminary injunction was limited to plaintiff&rsquo;s ability to access the boys' restrooms. 2016 WL 3581852.</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2016, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction, and asked it to be stayed pending the outcome of that appeal. The Fourth Circuit denied the stay on July 12, 2016. 654 Fed.Appx. 606.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants then sought relief from the Supreme Court. On August 3, 2016, the Court granted the application to stay the district court's preliminary injunction. If the Supreme Court declined to hear the full case, the stay would automatically end; if the Supreme Court ultimately heard the full case, the stay would end once the Court made its final judgment. 579 U.S. 961.</p>\r\n<p>The school board then filed an unopposed motion to stay in the district court on August 18, 2016. The court granted this motion on August 31, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2016, the defendants sought full review of the case from the Supreme Court. Three questions were presented in this petition. First, whether the Court should retain the <em>Auer</em> doctrine, which allows deference to agencies&rsquo; regulations even when the regulations are ambiguous. Second, whether the <em>Auer</em> deference extends to an unpublished agency letter that does not carry the force of law. Third, whether the DOE&rsquo;s Title IX interpretation is valid. On October 31, 2016, the Court agreed to hear the appeal of only the second and third questions presented. 137 S.Ct. 369.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2017, the new Trump administration withdrew the guidance that the Fourth Circuit had relied on in its rulings, and took no position on whether or how gender identity was covered under Title IX. Argument before the Supreme Court was set for March 28, 2017, but on March 6, the Court vacated the Fourth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of the government's change in position. 580 U.S. 1168.</p>\r\n<p>On remand from the Supreme Court, on April 7, 2017, the Fourth Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. 853 F.3d 729. It remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the case was rendered moot by the original plaintiff's graduation. Back in district court, the was reassigned to Judge Arenda Wright Allen on June 6, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 22, 2017, alleging he would be subject to the School Board's policy as an alumnus. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss on September 22, 2017, alleging that the plaintiff failed to state a claim because the Board's locker room and restroom policy was consistent with Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, and because alumni were not subject to the School Board's policies (which only apply to current students), this added claim was not a justiciable controversy. On October 26, 2017, Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen deferred a ruling on the defendant's motion to dismiss, pending resolution of the issue of mootness.</p>\r\n<p>On November 2, 2017, the plaintiff filed a notice of consent to dismissal as to his third and fourth requests for relief. The plaintiff agreed to dismiss his request for prospective declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief, but maintained his request for retrospective declaratory judgment and nominal damages. Following this approved withdrawal of requested prospective relief, the defendant filed an amended motion to dismiss on January 5, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On May 22, 2018, the court denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled that the school board&rsquo;s policy was not substantially related to protecting other students&rsquo; privacy rights, &ldquo;because there were many other ways to protect privacy interests in a non-discriminatory and more effective manner.&rdquo; The court also found that the board&rsquo;s argument that the policy did not discriminate against any one class of students was &ldquo;resoundingly unpersuasive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2019, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint that alleged additional facts regarding the defendant&rsquo;s ongoing violations of the plaintiff&rsquo;s rights. According to the second amended complaint, the plaintiff had obtained a Virginia court order declaring his sex as male and an updated birth certificate reflecting his sex as male. However, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant continued to refuse to update his official school transcript to match the male gender marker on his birth certificate.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2019, the plaintiff and the defendant separately filed motions for summary judgment. Along with summary judgment, the plaintiff sought a permanent injunction requiring the defendant to update his school records to reflect his male identity. On August 9, 2019, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendant's motion. The court stated that in order to obtain relief for claims alleging a violation of Title IX, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he or she was excluded from participation in an education program because of his or her sex; (2) the educational institution was receiving federal financial assistance at the time of his or her exclusion; and (3) the improper discrimination caused the plaintiff harm. The court found that the plaintiff demonstrated all three criteria. With respect to the EPC claim, the court held that intermediate scrutiny must be applied in analyzing claims of discrimination against transgender individuals. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for a permanent injunction. 400 F.Supp.3d 444</p>\r\n<p>The defendant appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on August 30, 2019, (USCA Case Number 19-1952) and oral argument was heard on May 26, 2020. In an opinion published on August 26, 2020, Circuit Judge Henry Floyd affirmed the district court&rsquo;s judgment. 972 F.3d 586. The defendant argued two issues on appeal: 1) that the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims pertaining to the restroom policy were moot because he was no longer seeking injunctive relief in his amended complaint, and 2) that his claims pertaining to his school records should have first been administratively exhausted by requesting a hearing. The court ruled against the defendant on both counts, finding on the first issue that the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim was not moot because a live controversy remained, and finding on the second issue that an exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required in this case. The court then addressed the plaintiff&rsquo;s EPC and Title IX claims. The court held that the defendant&rsquo;s restroom policy and refusal to update the plaintiff&rsquo;s records constituted sex-based discrimination and, subject to intermediate scrutiny, were not substantially related to the defendant&rsquo;s interest in protecting student privacy or maintaining accurate records, respectively. Both policies were therefore found to violate the EPC. Finally, the court also found for the plaintiff on his Title IX claims, agreeing with the district court that the plaintiff had demonstrated all three required elements of a Title IX claim.</p>\r\n<p>Following the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s opinion the defendant requested a rehearing, which stayed the proceedings on September 9. The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc on September 22, and the August judgment took effect on September 30, 2020. On February 24, 2021, the defendant filed a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, appealing the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s judgment. The Supreme Court denied the writ on June 28, 2021. The district court awarded the plaintiff attorney&rsquo;s fees on August 27, 2021 and, with no further proceedings pending, the case was concluded.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2015, a transgender boy filed a lawsuit against his school district because they would not allow him to use the boys' bathroom. The court granted the school district's motion to dismiss, but the appeals court reversed and remanded, and the district court has since granted a preliminary injunction allowing plaintiff access to the boy's bathroom. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the school district's appeal in 2016, but later remanded the case after the Department of Education and Department of Justice withdrew their prior guidance on the issue. The case was remanded to the district court to determine whether the plaintiff's graduation from high school rendered the case moot. On May 22, 2018, the district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on February 15, 2019, and a motion for summary judgment on March 26, 2019. On August 9, 2019, the court granted the summary judgment; the defendant appealed the case. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff on August 26, 2020. The defendant requested a rehearing before the Fourth Circuit, and after being denied, sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court on February 24, 2021, which was denied. The plaintiff was awarded attorney’s fees on August 27, 2021, and the case was closed.",

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleges claims under Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. ECF No. 109-1. \n2.  The Amended Complaint seeks both retrospective and prospective relief. \nRequests for Relief (A) and (B) seek a retrospective declaratory judgment and nominal damages. \nRequests for Relief (C) and (D) seek a prospective declaratory judgment and permanent \ninjunctive relief. \n3.  Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to \nstate a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). ECF No. 118. \n \n1 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 125   Filed 11/02/17   Page 2 of 4 PageID# 1213\n4.  On October 26, 2017, this Court issued an order construing the Defendant’s \nmotion as one brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to the extent it raises the question whether this \ncase presents a justiciable controversy. ECF No. 123 at 3. The Court explained that “[r]egardless \nof whether a controversy over the need for a preliminary injunction remains, the threshold \njurisdictional question of whether Plaintiff’s graduation from high school mooted the entire case \nremains before this Court.” Id. \n5.  The Court thus deferred resolution of whether the Amended Complaint stated a \nclaim for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) and directed the parties to submit evidence and supplemental \nbriefs regarding mootness. ECF No. 123 at 4. The Court directed Defendant to file its \nsupplemental brief no later than December 18, 2017, which is 60 calendar days from the entry of \nthe Court’s order. Id. at 6. \nCONSENT TO DISMISSAL OF REQUESTS FOR RELIEF (C) AND (D) \n \n6.

Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 235 (1989), \nplaintiff Ann Hopkins received comments from partners describing \nher as “macho,” suggesting that she “overcompensated for being a \nwoman,” and “advis[ing] her to take a course at charm school” \nduring her bid for partnership.  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. 228, \n235 (1989) (citations omitted).  Hopkins was told that to improve \nher  chances  of  attaining  partnership,  she  should  “walk  more \nfemininely,  talk  more  femininely,  dress  more  femininely,  wear \nmake-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.”  Id. (citation \nomitted).  Rejecting Price Waterhouse’s insinuation that acting in \nreliance on sex stereotyping was not prohibited by Title VII, the \nSupreme Court unequivocally stated otherwise: \n[W]e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate \nemployees by assuming or insisting that they matched \nthe stereotype associated with their group, for “[i]n \nforbidding  employers  to  discriminate  against \nindividuals because of their sex, Congress intended to \nstrike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment \nof men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.” \n \nId. at 251 (second alteration in original) (quoting Los Angeles \nDept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13 (1978)).  \nThe Supreme Court has expressly recognized that claims based on an \nindividual’s failure to conform to societal expectations based on \nthat person’s gender constitute discrimination “because of sex” \n \n2\n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 78   Filed 07/12/16   Page 3 of 6 PageID# 906\nunder Title VII.  Id. at 250–51 (plurality); Price Waterhouse, 490 \nU.S. at 272-73 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Price Waterhouse, 490 \nU.S. at 260-61 (White, J., concurring). \nThe  First,  Sixth,  Ninth,  and  Eleventh  Circuits  have  all \nrecognized that discrimination against a transgender individual \nbased  on  that  person’s  transgender  status  is  discrimination \nbecause of sex under federal civil rights statutes and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Constitution.  See Glenn v. Brumby, 663 \nF.3d 1312, 1316–19 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that terminating an \nemployee because she is transgender violates the prohibition on \nsex-based  discrimination  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause \nfollowing the reasoning of Price Waterhouse); Smith v. City of \nSalem, Ohio, 378 F.3d 566, 573–75 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that \ntransgender employee had stated a claim under Title VII based on \nthe reasoning of Price Waterhouse); Rosa v. Park W. Bank & Trust \nCo.,  214  F.3d  213,  215–16  (1st  Cir.  2000)  (holding  that  a \ntransgender individual could state a claim for sex discrimination \nunder the Equal Credit Opportunity Act based on Price Waterhouse); \nSchwenk  v.  Hartford,  204  F.3d  1187,  1201–03  (9th  Cir.  2000) \n(holding that a transgender individual could state a claim under \nthe Gender Motivated Violence Act under the reasoning of Price \nWaterhouse).  \nOn this long-settled jurisprudential foundation, our friend’s \nassertion  that  the  majority  opinion  issued  when  this  case  was \n \n3\n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 78   Filed 07/12/16   Page 4 of 6 PageID# 907\npreviously before us is “unprecedented” misses the mark.  In any \nevent, as regards the standards for a stay, the dissent contains \nits own rebuttal.  Contrary to the dissent’s assertion that “the \nSchool Board has constructed three unisex bathrooms to accommodate \nany person who feels uncomfortable using facilities separated on \nthe basis of sex,” the three unisex bathrooms are in fact available \nto “any student” at the school.  Mot. for Stay at 5. \nIn short, there is no reason to disturb the district court’s \nexercise  of  discretion  in  denying  the  motion  to  stay  its \npreliminary injunction. \n \nNIEMEYER,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting  from  the  denial  of  a  stay \npending appeal: \n \n  I would grant Gloucester County School Board’s motion for a \nstay pending appeal.  See Long v. Robinson, 432 F.2d 977 (4th Cir. \n1970); cf. Winter v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7 (2008).  Facially, the district court conducted no analysis \nrequired  by  Winter  for  the  entry  of  a  preliminary  injunction, \nrelying only on our earlier decision in this case.  And under the \nbalancing analysis prescribed by Long, I conclude that a stay is \nappropriate, based on the following: \n1.  The earlier groundbreaking decision of this court is, as \nI have noted previously, unprecedented.  Indeed, it appears to \nviolate  the  clear,  unambiguous  language  of  Title  IX,  which \nexplicitly authorizes the provision of various separate facilities \n \n4\n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 78   Filed 07/12/16   Page 5 of 6 PageID# 908\n“on the basis of sex.”  Moreover, the court’s decision applying \ndeference  under  Auer  v.  Robins,  519  U.S.  452  (1997),  is \nquestionable, and, even if deference were appropriate, it relies \nsolely on a letter from the U.S. Department of Education, imposing \nan entirely new interpretation of “sex” in Title IX without the \nsupport of any law.  In view of this, it is difficult to understand \nhow the decision is sustainable.   \n2.  By  enforcing  the  injunction  now,  male  students  at \nGloucester  High  School  will  be  denied  the  separate  facilities \nprovided by the School Board on the basis of sex, as authorized by \nCongress, and thus will be denied bodily privacy when using the \nfacilities, to the dismay of the students and their parents.  These \nconsequences are likely to cause disruption both in the school and \namong the parents. \n3.  While  I  recognize  the  sensitivities  of  G.G.’s  gender \ntransition, I nonetheless conclude that he is unlikely to suffer \nsubstantial injury from a stay of the district court’s injunction, \nparticularly because the School Board has constructed three unisex \nbathrooms to accommodate any person who feels uncomfortable using \nfacilities separated on the basis of sex. \n4.  The public interest in a final and orderly resolution of \nG.G.’s claims before enforcement of this court’s decision is served \nby a stay pending appeal.  The changes that this injunction would \nrequire -- and that the Department of Justice and Department of \n \n5\n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 78   Filed 07/12/16   Page 6 of 6 PageID# 909\nEducation now seek to impose nationwide on the basis of our earlier \ndecision -- mark a dramatic departure from the responsibilities \nlocal  school  boards  have  heretofore  understood  and  the \nauthorizations  that  Congress  has  long  provided.    These  school \nboards  and  the  communities  they  serve  would  benefit  from  the \nthoughtful  and  final  disposition  of  G.G.’s  claims,  and  from \nultimate guidance from the Supreme Court or Congress, before having \nto undertake these sweeping reforms. \nIn short, I conclude that the Gloucester County School \nBoard has adequately made its case for a stay pending appeal, \nand I would grant its motion for such a stay. \n \n6\n ",

First, Grimm’s impending graduation will moot \nthis appeal, which should therefore be dismissed. Second, if the Court \nreaches  the  merits,  the  Board’s  restroom  and  locker  room  policy  is \npermitted by the plain text of the Title IX regulation allowing “separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. Indeed, as Grimm’s brief implicitly concedes, Grimm Supp. Br. \nat 33–34, the prior panel “conclude[d]” that the regulation “permits … \nthe Board’s reading.” G.G. v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 720 \n(4th Cir. 2016). It is therefore impossible to avoid the conclusion that the \nBoard’s policy is lawful under Title IX, especially now that the sole basis \nfor the panel’s prior decision—the federal guidance equating “sex” with \n“gender identity”—has been rescinded. \nThe  Court  should  either  dismiss  Grimm’s  appeal  or  affirm  the \ndistrict court’s decision dismissing Grimm’s Title IX claim.          \n\nARGUMENT \nI.  Grimm’s Supplemental Brief Confirms That This Appeal \nWill Become Moot When Grimm Graduates. \nThe  Board’s  supplemental  brief  showed  that  when  Grimm \ngraduates on June 10, 2017, the question of Grimm’s bathroom access as \na student will become moot. Supp. Br. at 18–20. Courts have routinely \ndismissed  Title  IX  injunctive  relief  claims  as  moot  when  plaintiffs \ngraduate. See, e.g., Cook v. Colgate Univ., 992 F.2d 17, 19 (2d Cir. 1993) \n(collecting cases). The burden is therefore on Grimm to identify some \nother justiciable issue that will remain live. Supp. Br. at 19. Grimm’s \nsupplemental brief anticipates the Board’s concern, but only underscores \nthe incipient jurisdictional defect. This Court should therefore dismiss \nthe appeal as moot. \nThe sole basis Grimm offers for jurisdiction post-graduation is that \nthe Board’s policy might apply to Grimm as an alumnus. Grimm Supp. \nBr. at 19.1 That theory has multiple flaws. \n                                      \n1  Grimm, correctly, does not contend that jurisdiction can be predicated on the \navailability of nominal damages under Title IX. Compare Grimm Supp. Br. at 20–21, \nwith Supp. Br. at 19–20. The district court dismissed only Grimm’s Title IX claim, \nnot Grimm’s Equal Protection claim, see JA154, and did not enter a Rule 54(b) final \njudgment as to Title IX. Its dismissal of the Title IX claim was thus not a “final \n \n  2 \n\nFirst, because Grimm has not pled how the Board’s policy will affect \nGrimm  as  an  alumnus,  Grimm  lacks  standing  to  seek  relief  in  that \ncapacity.  To  confer  standing,  threatened  future  injuries  “must  be \ncertainly  impending,”  and  not  merely  “allegations  of  possible  future \ninjury[.]” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013) \n(quotes  and  alteration  omitted).  But  Grimm  has  not  alleged  any \nparticular intention to return to school after graduation: Whether and \nwhen Grimm plans ever to attend “alumni events,” “homecoming or prom \nas  a  guest,”  or  “football  games  and  other  community  events”  is \nspeculative.  Grimm  Supp.  Br.  at  19.  These  “‘some  day’  intentions” \n“without … even any specification of when the some day will be” do not \n                                      \ndecision” appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291; Robinson v. Parke-Davis & Co., 685 F.2d \n912, 913 (4th Cir. 1982) (per curiam). This Court’s jurisdiction to review dismissal of \nGrimm’s Title IX claim is therefore pendent on its jurisdiction to review denial of \nGrimm’s preliminary injunction motion. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1); Grimm Supp. Br. \nat 20–21. Grimm’s claim for nominal damages under Title IX does not independently \nsupport  jurisdiction.  See  Roberson  v.  Mullins,  29  F.3d  132,  136  (4th  Cir.  1994) \n(pendent jurisdiction applies only “[w]hen we properly have jurisdiction” over another \norder). \n \n  3 \n\nestablish a justiciable claim. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 \n(1992).2  \nSecond,  because  it  is  not  evident  that  the  Board’s  policy  even \napplies to alumni—it is directed at “students,” and says nothing about \nalumni, see JA15–16—Grimm’s claims regarding future alumni events \nare unripe. See, e.g., Scoggins v. Lee’s Crossing Homeowners Ass’n, 718 \nF.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2013) (ripeness turns on “fitness” of issues for \nadjudication and “hardship” to parties from withholding adjudication). \nThe question whether the Board’s policy applies to alumni is unfit for \nadjudication because it “‘rests upon contingent future events that may \nnot occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Id. (quoting \nTexas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998)). Furthermore, given \nthat Grimm has not even pled any plan to attend alumni events, there is \nno  obvious  hardship  in  reserving  adjudication  until  the  policy’s \napplication at alumni events becomes relevant. Id. at 271 (observing that \n                                      \n2  That distinguishes Ross v. City University of New York, where the plaintiff had \nalleged “far more than the vague ‘some day’ intentions to return” to school after \ngraduation. 211 F. Supp. 3d 518, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2016); Grimm Supp. Br. at 19. \n \n  4 \n\nan issue was “not time-sensitive, and thus a holding that the claim is not \nripe will not present an immediate threat to the plaintiffs”). \nThird, even if Grimm had standing and a ripe claim regarding \nalumni events, as an alumnus Grimm would lack a claim for injunctive \nrelief under Title IX. Title IX prohibits discrimination in “any education \nprogram or activity.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. As an alumnus, however, Grimm \nwill  no  longer  be  a  participant  in  Gloucester  County  “education \nprogram[s] or activit[ies],” but simply a member of the public. Grimm has \ncited no authority holding that Title IX applies to non-students in post-\ngraduation programs and activities, or gives them a claim against schools \nthey once attended. The only cases Grimm cites arose not under Title IX, \nbut the Americans With Disabilities Act and other statutes that apply \ngenerally to programs and activities occurring on school property, not \njust educational ones provided to students. See Grimm Supp. Br. at 19 \n(citing Denmeade v. King, No. 00-CV-0407E(F), 2002 WL 31018148, at *4 \n(W.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2002), and Ross, 211 F. Supp. 3d 518).3  \n                                      \n3  One of Grimm’s cases distinguishes, on that ground, a Title IX case finding \nmootness post-graduation. See Denmeade, 2002 WL 31018148, at *4 (distinguishing \nnon-justiciable case because “the inaccessibility of the campus gives the plaintiffs—\nas students or alumni—a personal stake in this action”) (footnote omitted).  \n  5 \n\nGrimm attempts to avoid these jurisdictional flaws by citing cases \nwhere a “defendant claim[s] that its voluntary compliance moots a case.” \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 190 (2000); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 222 \n(2000);  Grimm  Supp.  Br.  at  20  n.14.  But  that  analogy  is  false;  the \nmootness here comes not from any change in the Board’s policy, but from \nGrimm’s change in status from student to alumnus—one who may or may \nnot return for any particular alumni events, who in any case would likely \nnot be subject to the Board’s policy, and who would not have any Title IX \nrecourse anyway.  \nII.  The Board’s Restroom And Locker Room Policy Is Plainly \nPermitted By Title IX And Section 106.33. \nThe  Board’s  supplemental  brief  showed  that  its  policy—which \ndesignates multiple-user restrooms and locker rooms by biological sex \nand not gender identity—is valid under Title IX and its implementing \nregulation, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. Supp. Br. at 21–23. First, that regulation \npermits a policy like the Board’s by allowing schools to provide “separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” if those \nfacilities are “comparable” for “students of one sex” and “students of the \nother  sex.”  34  C.F.R.  §  106.33  (emphasis  added).    Second,  Grimm’s \n  6 \n\nproposed  re-interpretation  of  Title  IX—making  sex  turn  on  gender \nidentity—violates Title IX’s text, history, and structure. Supp. Br. at 21–\n32, 38–45. Grimm’s view finds no support in any Title IX-era (or modern) \ndictionary, id. at 24–26, and would subvert Title IX’s structure, which \nallows separation of “the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, in settings \nsuch as living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and athletic \nteams.4  \nGrimm’s supplemental brief fails to rebut any of these points. \nA. As Grimm concedes, the prior panel already found that \nSection 106.33 permits the Board’s policy. \nGrimm all but concedes that the key Title IX regulation, Section \n106.33, permits the Board’s policy. As Grimm’s brief acknowledges when \nit finally addresses that regulation—after 32 pages—it concedes that the \nprior panel found Section 106.33 “‘susceptible to more than one plausible \nreading’” regarding how to determine a transgender person’s sex. Supp. \nBr. at 33–34 (quoting G.G., 822 F.3d at 720). And one of those “plausible \nreading[s]”  actually  validates  the  Board’s  policy:  “[T]he  regulation,” \n                                      \n4   The Board also argued that Grimm’s interpretation would invalidate Title IX \nunder the Spending Clause and should be rejected as a matter of constitutional \navoidance. Supp. Br. at 45–47. Grimm’s supplemental brief does not address this \nissue and so neither does the Board’s reply. \n  7 \n\nexplained  the  panel,  “permits  both  the  Board’s  reading  …  and  the \nDepartment’s interpretation[.]” 822 F.3d 720 (emphasis added). Now that \nthe Department’s interpretation has been rescinded (and deference to it \nis  no  longer  an  issue),  the  outcome  is  plain:  Because  Section  106.33 \n“permits … the Board’s reading,” the Board’s policy must be valid under \nTitle IX. Id. \nGrimm  vainly  attempts  to  avoid  this  result.  First,  while \nacknowledging  the  panel’s  conclusion  that  the  regulation  was \n“ambiguous … in the broader regulatory context,” Grimm now claims the \n“ambiguity disappears when the regulation is read … within the broader \nstatutory context.” Grimm Supp. Br. at 34. That makes no sense: The \nterm the panel found ambiguous—“sex”—appears in both the regulation \nand the statute, and, as the panel noted, that term “should be construed \nuniformly throughout Title IX and its implementing regulations.” G.G., \n822 F.3d at 723. If the regulation “permits” the Board’s reading of “sex,” \nTitle IX’s use of the same term cannot forbid it. \nFurthermore,  Grimm’s  reading  of  the  statute  means  that  the \nregulation unambiguously requires equating a “transgender boy” with a \n“boy” under Title IX. See Grimm Supp. Br. at 35 (arguing “[t]he only way \n  8 \n\nto provide sex-separated restrooms … is to allow boys and girls who are \ntransgender to use the same restrooms that other boys and girls use”). \nBut this radical interpretation contradicts every prior resolution of the \ninterpretive question before the Court. It contradicts the prior panel’s \nconclusion that the regulation is susceptible to “more than one plausible \nreading”  regarding  transgender  persons.  G.G.,  822  F.3d  at  720.  It \ncontradicts  the  United  States’  previous  view,  which  “consider[ed] \n§ 106.33 to be ambiguous as to transgender students[.]” Id. at 719. It even \ncontradicts  Grimm’s  own  prior  position  before  this  Court.5 Grimm’s \nnewfound insistence that the regulation is “unambiguous” when applied \nto transgender students cannot be taken seriously.  \nSecond,  Grimm  concedes  the  regulation  “permits  differential \ntreatment on the basis of sex,” but claims that treatment is allowed only \nif it “does not subject anyone to unequal discrimination in violation of the \nstatute.”  Grimm  Supp.  Br.  at  35.  That  also  makes  no  sense:  If  the \nregulation permits the Board to provide sex-separated restrooms based \n                                      \n5  Grimm Opening Br. at 35 (Doc. 15) (stating “plain text of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 … \ndoes  not  resolve—or  even  address—whether  schools  may  exclude  transgender \nstudents from the restrooms consistent with their gender identity”). \n  9 \n\non its reading of “sex,” then Title IX cannot simultaneously condemn the \nBoard’s policy as “sex” discrimination. Again, “sex” cannot mean one \nthing in the regulation and another in the statute. \nThird, Grimm  claims the regulation requires schools to provide \n“access to ‘comparable’ restrooms for all students.” Id. at 36. But Grimm \nmisstates Section 106.33, which requires only that separate facilities “for \nstudents of one sex shall be comparable … for students of the other sex,” \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added). Grimm has never alleged that the \nfacilities for males are not “comparable” to those for females. The fact \nthat the Board has gone beyond what the regulation allows by providing \nadditional single-user restrooms hardly means the Board has engaged in \nsex discrimination or failed to provide “comparable” facilities. Indeed, \nunder Grimm’s reading of Title IX, the Board would apparently have to \nprovide at least three comparable sets of restrooms and locker rooms: one \nfor  biological  males,  one  for  biological  females,  and  another  for \ntransgender students. Title IX requires no such thing.    \nIn short, as the prior panel correctly concluded, Section 106.33 by \nits terms permits the Board’s restroom and locker room policy, and so the \nBoard’s policy does not violate Title IX. \n  10 \n\nB. Grimm  is  incorrect  that  Title  IX  requires  treating \n“transgender boys and girls” exactly like other boys and \ngirls for purposes of restroom and locker room access. \nGrimm’s supplemental brief makes no attempt to show that gender \nidentity should determine sex for Title IX purposes, even though this was \npreviously one of Grimm’s central theories. See, e.g., Grimm Mem. in \nSupp. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 17 n.13 (Dist. Ct. Doc. 18) (claiming “no \ndistinction  between  an  individual’s  gender  identity  and  his  or  her \n‘biological’ sex or gender”). Indeed, the idea that sex turns on gender \nidentity was also central to the now-rescinded guidance documents. See \nG.G., 822 F.3d at 721 (noting “[t]he Department’s interpretation … that \n… sex as male or female is to be generally determined by reference to the \nstudent’s  gender  identity”).  Instead  of  that  position,  Grimm’s \nsupplemental brief defends the broader position that Title IX requires a \n“boy who is transgender” to be treated the same as other boys—and a \n“girl  who  is  transgender”  the  same  as  other  girls—for  purposes  of \naccessing sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms. See, e.g., Grimm \nSupp.  Br.  at  7,  34  (arguing  that  Section  106.33  does  not  authorize \nexcluding “boys and girls who are transgender from the restrooms that \nother boys and girls use”). This broader theory has even less support in \n  11 \n\nTitle IX’s text, history, and structure than the argument equating sex \nwith gender identity. \nTo  assess  Grimm’s  theory,  one  must  flesh  out  what  the  term \n“transgender” means, based on Grimm’s own authorities.6 According to \nDSM-V, “[t]ransgender refers to the broad spectrum of individuals who \ntransiently or persistently identify with a gender different from their \nnatal gender.” DSM-V at 451; see also JA28–29 (Grimm Decl.); JA11 \n(Compl.).  Transgender  persons  sometimes  experience  “gender \ndysphoria,”  meaning  distress  caused  by  divergence  between  gender \nidentity and birth sex. DSM-V at 451; JA36–37 (Ettner Decl.). According \nto Grimm’s sources, gender dysphoric persons may identify with the sex \nopposite their birth sex, DSM-V at 453; or they may “desire to be of an \nalternative gender,” id.; or they may be gender fluid (“having different \ngender  identities  at  different  times”),  agendered  (“having  no  gender \nidentity”), or gender expansive (“a wider, more flexible range of gender \n                                      \n6   See, e.g., Grimm Supp. Br. at 3–4 & n. 2 (citing Am. Psychiatric Ass’n (“APA”), \nDiagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (“DSM-V”)); id. \nat 6 n. 5 (citing Am. Psychological Ass’n (“APsyA”) & Nat’l Ass’n Sch. Psychologists \n(“NASP”), Resolution on Gender and Sexual Orientation Diversity in Children and \nAdolescents in Schools (2015)); JA9, 11–14 (Complaint); JA28–30 (Grimm Decl.); \nJA36–42 (Decl. of Randi Ettner, Ph.D.).  \n  12 \n\nidentity  and/or  expression  than  typically  associated  with  the  binary \ngender  system”).  APA,  What  is  Gender  Dysphoria?,  available  at \nhttps://goo.gl/ymR8Nl.  Grimm’s  sources  also  explain  that  gender \ndysphoria  in  children  generally  does  not  persist  into  adolescence  or \nadulthood—i.e., for roughly 98% to 70% of males and 88% to 50% of \nfemales. DSM-V at 455; see also APA, What Is Gender Dysphoria? (“For \nmany children the feelings [associated with gender dysphoria] do not \ncontinue into adolescence and adulthood.”) (at “Treatment” tab).  \nSome transgender persons are advised by doctors to “transition” so \nthat  their  appearance,  physiology,  and  social  behavior  match  their \ngender  identity.  JA38  (Ettner Decl.).  A transition  may  include  using \nhormone blockers to prevent onset of puberty and cross-sex hormones to \ncreate the appearance of being a different sex; genital surgery; dressing \nand  grooming  like  the  opposite  sex;  adopting  a  name  and  pronouns \ncharacteristic of another sex (or no sex); and using restrooms and other \nfacilities designated for the opposite sex. See id. \nHaving specified what Grimm means by “transgender,” the issue is \nwhether Grimm is correct that “transgender boys” must be treated as \nequivalent to “other boys” (and “transgender girls” equivalent to “other \n  13 \n\ngirls”) for purposes of Title IX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination and \nSection 106.33’s allowance of sex-separated facilities. The answer is no. \nFirst, as already demonstrated, all evidence shows that the Title IX \nterm “sex” is a binary concept referring to the physiological differences \nbetween males and females, and no evidence suggests the term turned \non gender identity. Supp. Br. at 23–38. That same evidence shows, even \nmore strongly, that Title IX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination does not \nrequire  equating  “boys”  with  “transgender  boys”  or  “girls”  with \n“transgender girls.” That is, no evidence shows that a “boy” for Title IX \npurposes must include someone born female but whose gender dysphoria \nled her to masculinize her appearance or physiology. This conclusion is \nreinforced by the fact that transgender persons may identify as neither \nmale nor female, may shift between the two, may identify as having no \nsex, and usually desist from gender dysphoria after childhood. See supra. \nIn short, Grimm points to no evidence showing that the Title IX term \n“sex” encompasses the multi-faceted and fluid concept of “transgender.” \nGrimm’s medical sources also confirm that “sex” and “transgender” \nare distinct. For instance, the DSM-V defines “sex” as referring to “the \nbiological indicators of male and female (understood in the context of \n  14 \n\nreproductive capacity),” and contrasts it with “gender identity,” which \n“refers to an individual’s identification as male, female, or occasionally, \nsome category other than male or female.” DSM-V at 451; see Grimm \nSupp. Br. at 3 n.2 (citing DSM-V). Similarly the NASP defines “sex” as \n“refer[ring]  to  a  person’s  biological  characteristics,  including \nchromosomes, hormones, and anatomy,” in contrast to “transgender,” \nwhich  means  “having  a  gender  identity  that  differs  from  culturally \ndetermined gender roles and biological sex.” NASP Position Statement, \nSafe Schools for Transgender and Gender Diverse Students 6 (emphasis \nadded), available at https://goo.gl/V5MuEz; see Grimm Supp. Br. at 6 n.5 \n(citing NASP). Thus, even the medical sources on which Grimm relies \ndistinguish “biological sex” from “transgender.” \nSecond,  Grimm  claims  that  equating  “boys  and  girls  who  are \ntransgender”  with  “other  boys  and  girls”  (respectively)  is  “entirely \nconsistent  with  the  ordinary  definition  of  ‘sex,’  both  at  the  time  the \nregulations  was  [sic]  enacted  and  today.”  Grimm  Supp.  Br.  at  37 \n(emphasis added). Grimm offers no support for that dramatic claim. \nInstead,  Grimm  purports  to  rely  on  the  prior  panel,  which \nsupposedly “observed” that the “plain meaning of sex in 1972 extended \n  15 \n\nbeyond physical characteristics such as anatomy or chromosomes,” and \nincluded “both physical differences and cultural ones,” id. at 37–38. But \nthe panel did not say that: It simply quoted two 1970s-era definitions of \n“sex” referring to the “anatomical and physiological differences” between \nmales and females and to “the sum of the morphological, physiological, \nand behavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserves biparental \nreproduction.”  G.G.,  822  F.3d  at  721  (quoting  American  College \nDictionary 1109 (1970) and Webster’s Third New International Dictionary \n2081 (1971)). It found on that basis that the term “sex” was ambiguous \nas applied to transgender persons, and thus deferred to the Department’s \nnow-rescinded guidance  documents,  G.G.,  822  F.3d  at  722–23,  but it \nhardly  held that the “plain  meaning” of  the term includes “cultural” \ndifferences. Grimm Supp. Br. at 38.       \nGrimm points to only one other definition—from the online Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary—to claim that the “plain meaning” of “sex” includes \n“cultural” differences between men and women. Grimm Supp. Br. at 38 \n(quoting OED Online, Oxford Univ. Press, “sex, n., 4a”). But Grimm \nrefers to a subpart of one definition of “sex”—which merely considers the \nterm as “a social or cultural phenomenon”—while disregarding another \n  16 \n\ndefinition that “sex” is “[e]ither of the two main categories (male and \nfemale) into which humans and many other living things are divided on \nthe basis of their reproductive functions.” OED Online, sex, n, 1a. In any \nevent, even assuming that “sex” has social and cultural aspects, that does \nnot mean the term as used in Title IX hinges on gender identity or the \nfluid  “transgender”  concept.  Cherry-picking  definitions  is  no  way  to \ninterpret text. See, e.g., MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 \nU.S. 218, 227–28 (1994). \nThird,  Grimm  argues  that,  even  if  “sex”  were  “solely  based  on \nphysiology or anatomy,” this would not determine the appropriate Title \nIX restrooms for transgender persons, because—given methods such as \nhormone  therapy—“[m]any  …  have  physiological  and  anatomical \ncharacteristics associated with their identity, not the sex identified for \nthem at birth.” Grimm Supp. Br. at 38. But that is irrelevant. Grimm’s \nclaims have never depended on external physical appearances, nor on \nwhether  someone  has  undergone  a  sex  change—which  in  any  event \nGrimm concedes would be inappropriate for minors. See JA38 (Ettner \nDecl.). But even if such considerations were relevant, there is no evidence \nsuggesting that Title IX’s use of the term “sex” plausibly includes persons \n  17 \n\nof one birth sex who, given their gender dysphoria, have altered their \nappearance or physiology. In sum, to read into Title IX some definitive \nanswer to the question of which “sex” a “transgender” person should be \nconsidered  for  purposes  of  sex-separated  facilities—even  assuming  a \nsingle answer is possible—would be to legislate a version of Title IX that \ndoes not exist. \nC. Grimm  ignores  the  myriad  administrative  problems \ninherent in reading “sex” to encompass “gender identity” \nor “transgender status.” \nThe Board’s supplemental brief also highlighted the web of serious \nproblems that would result from reading “sex” in Title IX to turn on \n“gender identity”: (1) eliminating schools’ ability to separate students of \ndifferent physiological sexes in restrooms, locker rooms, and showers—a \nprivacy  measure  contemplated  by  Title  IX,  Supp.  Br.  at  39–40; \n(2) eliminating schools’ ability to provide sex-separated athletic teams—\nalso contemplated by Title IX, id. at 40–42; (3) requiring discrimination \nin favor of transgender persons, who could elect to use either facilities \ndesignated for their birth sex or gender identity, id. at 42; (4) unfairly \ndisregarding  the  privacy  of  students  distressed  at  being  in  intimate \nsettings with students of the opposite physiological sex, id. at 42–43; \n  18 \n\n(5) exposing  schools  to  potential  hostile  environment  or  harassment \nclaims,  id.  at  43–44;  (6) forcing  schools  to  evaluate  students’  sex \naccording to  masculine or  feminine  appearance,  which  is  classic  sex-\nstereotyping,  id.  at  44;  and  (7) rendering  Title  IX  invalid  under  the \nSpending Clause, id. at 45–47.  \nGrimm’s  two-fold  response  is  that  any  claimed  administrative \ndifficulties are contradicted, first, by the “actual experiences” of school \nadministrators “across the country,” and second, by the “reality” that \nsome institutions already “recognize boys who are transgender as boys \nand recognize girls who are transgender as girls.” Grimm Supp. Br. at \n40–41. These responses fail to address the problems the Board raised. \nFor  example,  the  School  Administrators’  amicus  brief  on  which \nGrimm relies, id. at 40, is from a self-selected group of administrators \nwith a vested interest in defending their own transgender policies. See \nBr. of School Admins. (Doc. 155). Yet even these administrators admit \nthat because of “‘weight, personal comfort, body image, social anxiety, or \nother reasons,’” some non-transgender students feel compelled to use \nalternative facilities when transgender students are present. Id. at 22–\n24. They also admit to evaluating claims of transgender status based on \n  19 \n\nstudents’  consistent  conformity  to  the  stereotypes  of  their  asserted \ngender  identity—for  example,  by  “wear[ing]  female  attire’”  and \n“present[ing] as female to all of [one’s] friends and teachers[.]” Id. at 20–\n21. In other words, these “successful” policies admittedly result in two of \nthe  harmful  consequences  identified  by  the  Board,  namely  privacy \nviolations and sex stereotyping. Supp. Br. at 42–44. \nGrimm’s claims about the policies of various institutions—such as \nthe  Girl  and  Boy  Scouts,  the  U.S.  military,  and  the  NCAA—are \nmisleading. See Grimm Supp. Br. at 41 & nn. 24–29. Contrary to Grimm’s \nsuggestion,  those  policies  do  not  simply  “recognize  boys  who  are \ntransgender as boys and … girls who are transgender as girls.” Id. at 41. \nFor instance, the Girl Scouts’ policy handles placement of transgender \nyouth  “on  a  case-by-case  basis”;  considers  “camping”  arrangements \n“individually” through “special accommodations”; and promises only that \nsomeone who “lives culturally as a girl” will be “serve[d] … in a setting \nthat is both emotionally and physically safe.” See Girl Scouts, Frequently \nAsked Questions: Social Issues, available at https://goo.gl/364fXI (cited at \nGrimm Supp. Br. at 41 n.24). The Girl Scouts’ policy guarantees nothing \n  20 \n\nabout  restroom,  changing  room,  or  shower  access;  it  does  not  even \nmention the issue.7  \nThe NCAA policy is even more carefully drawn. Supp. Br. at 41 \nn.14. While seeking to accommodate transgender athletes, the NCAA \nrestricts  male-to-female  transgender  individuals  from  competing  on \nfemale  teams  “until  completing  one  calendar  year  of  testosterone \nsuppression treatment.” Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, NCAA Inclusion \nof  Transgender  Student-Athletes  13  (2011),  available  at \nhttps://goo.gl/V2Oxb2.  The  NCAA’s  policy  thus  contradicts  Grimm’s \nblanket policy by treating only certain transgender females as equivalent \nto other females.8 \n                                      \n7   The Boy Scouts say only that they will “accept and register youth in the Cub \nand Boy Scout programs based on the gender identity indicated on the application.” \nSee Boy Scouts of America, BSA Addresses Gender Identity (Jan. 30, 2017), available \nat https://goo.gl/WxNoGY. \n8   Similarly, the policies of the U.S. military and the Virginia High School League \n(“VHSL”) (both cited by Grimm) do not simply treat “transgender boys and girls” as \nother boys and girls. The military treats transgender persons according to their \n“preferred  gender”  only  following  “a  diagnosis  from  a  military  medical  provider \nindicating  that  gender  transition  is  medically  necessary,”  and  only  when  the \ntransition  is  “complete.”  See  Dep’t  of  Def.  Instruction  No  1300.28:  In-Service \nTransition for Transgender Service Members at 3–4 (June 30, 2016), available at \nhttps://goo.gl/p9xsaB. The VHSL allows waivers for transgender students only under \ncertain  circumstances,  for  instance  where  “hormonal  therapy  …  has  been \nadministered in a verifiable manner and for a sufficient length of time to minimize \ngender-related advantages.” Va. High Sch. League, Criteria for VHSL Transgender \nRule Appeals, available at https://goo.gl/fgQe2l.  \n  21 \n\nThe fact that the very organizations on which Grimm relies reject \nGrimm’s  one-size-fits-all  policy  is  devastating  to  Grimm’s  argument. \nEach of these organizations has a nuanced policy responsive to its own \nspecific circumstances—just  as the  Board  does.  None of  those  varied \npolicies suggests some magic bullet that will solve every issue raised by \ntransgender persons. And none of those policies remotely suggests that \nTitle IX dictates any particular approach to this novel and complex area, \nwhich is the core of Grimm’s argument. \nGrimm thus has no answer to the concerns identified in the Board’s \nsupplemental  brief.  Grimm’s  position  would  make  it  impossible  for \nschools to continue to separate students by “sex” in any setting. And if—\nas  the  School  Administrators’  brief  suggests—schools  would  evaluate \ntransgender students’ claims based on outward conformity to inward \ngender, sex stereotyping is virtually inevitable. Any interpretation of \nTitle IX that would put administrators in that precarious position should \nbe rejected. \n  22 \n\nD. Grimm ignores the privacy concerns caused by reading \n“sex” in Title IX as encompassing “gender identity” or \n“transgender status.” \nGrimm blithely dismisses other students’ privacy concerns with the \nipse dixit that Grimm’s “use of the boys’ restroom does not infringe on \nanyone else’s privacy rights.” Grimm Supp. Br. at 44. Indeed, Grimm’s \nunconcern applies “even in the context of locker rooms” since, according \nto Grimm, “[i]n many schools, students … change [clothes] without fully \nundressing.” Id. at 45 n.32. All this would come as a surprise to Justice \nGinsburg, who wrote in United States v. Virginia that admitting women \nto  a  previously  all-male  military  school  “would  undoubtedly  require \nalterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the \nother sex in living arrangements[.]” 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996). And it \nwould  also  surprise  many  members  of  this  Circuit,  which  has  noted \n“society’s undisputed approval of separate public rest rooms for men and \nwomen based on privacy concerns.” Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 \n(4th Cir. 1993). \nPeople legitimately form privacy expectations in public restrooms, \nlocker rooms, or showers not based on whether people might be partially \nor fully undressed in those facilities, or whether bathroom stalls have \n  23 \n\n“privacy strips,” but at the doors marked “M” and “W.” That is why Title \nIX regulations have long allowed certain separate “facilities” on the basis \nof “sex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, a policy choice that Grimm does not purport \nto  contest.  If  there  is  to  be  a  different  policy—one  that  recalibrates \npeople’s privacy expectations in intimate facilities—it should come from \nCongress, or at least from an agency’s rulemaking. It should not come \nfrom courts under the guise of “interpreting” Title IX in a way that would \nsubvert  the  expectations  of  its  framers.  As  this  Court  has  already \nconcluded,  “the  weighing  of  privacy  interests  or  safety  concerns—\nfundamentally questions of policy—is a task committed to the agency,” \nor to Congress, “not to the courts.” G.G., 822 F.3d at 723–24.      \nE. The  Board’s  policy  does  not  engage  in  “transgender \nstatus” discrimination or in “sex stereotyping.” \nRelying  on  out-of-circuit  precedent,  Grimm  asks  this  Court  to \nrecognize  a  Title  IX  claim  for  “transgender  status”  discrimination. \nGrimm Supp. Br. at 21–22. Relatedly, Grimm argues that the Board’s \npolicy is “sex stereotyping” under Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. \n228 (1989). Id. at 23. Grimm is mistaken. \n  24 \n\nGrimm’s cases do not recognize a claim for “transgender status” \ndiscrimination.9 Instead, those cases—arising largely under Title VII—\ninvolve  adverse  action  (such  as  firing)  taken  because  a  transgender \nperson’s appearance does not conform to birth sex. See, e.g., Finkle v. \nHoward Cnty., 12 F. Supp. 3d 780, 781, 789 (D. Md. 2014) (Title VII claim \nbased on allegations that male-to-female transgender was not hired due \nto  masculine  appearance).  In  those  situations,  some  courts  have \nrecognized a sex stereotyping claim. See, e.g., Smith v. City of Salem, 378 \nF.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2004) (recognizing Title VII claim when male-to-\nfemale transgender was allegedly fired for “conduct and mannerisms … \n[that]  did  not  conform  with  his  employer’s  and  co-workers’  sex \nstereotypes of how a man should look and behave”).  \n                                      \n9   See,  e.g.,  Schroer  v.  Billington,  577  F.  Supp.  2d  293,  305  (D.D.C.  2008) \n(observing that “transsexuality itself … [is] a characteristic that, in and of itself, \nnearly all federal courts have said is unprotected by Title VII”); see also, e.g., Johnston \nv. Univ. of Pittsburgh Univ. of the Com. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 674 \n(W.D. Pa. 2015) (observing that “nearly every federal court that has considered the \nquestion in the Title VII context has found that transgendered individuals are not a \nprotected class under Title VII”); Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1221 \n(10th Cir. 2007) (joining “vast majority of federal courts … and conclud[ing] that \ndiscrimination against a transsexual based on that person’s status as a transsexual \nis not discrimination because of sex under Title VII”).   \n \n  25 \n\nWhether or not those decisions are correct, they have no application \nhere. Most obviously, the Board’s policy distinguishes students based on \nbiological  sex—not  “transgender  status”  or  masculine  or  feminine \nappearance. The Board’s policy is thus the opposite of sex stereotyping. \nSupp. Br. at 36–38. The Tenth Circuit agrees, explaining that the “[u]se \nof a restroom designated for the opposite sex does not constitute a mere \nfailure  to  conform  to  sex  stereotypes.”  Etsitty,  502  F.3d  at  1224.10 \nFurthermore, far from taking adverse action against persons based on \ngender-nonconforming appearance, the Board’s policy merely separates \nstudents based on biological sex—as has been allowed by Title IX for \nnearly half a century. See, e.g., Johnston, 97 F. Supp. 3d at 672–82, 678 \n(rejecting transgender plaintiff’s Title IX claim against sex-separated \nrestrooms  and  “find[ing]  particularly  compelling  that  the  regulations \n                                      \n10   The Seventh Circuit recently became the first to recognize a sex stereotyping \nclaim against sex-separated school restrooms, on the theory that establishing such \nrestrooms  “punishes  [a  transgender]  individual  for  his  or  her  gender  non-\nconformance.” Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist., __ F.3d __, 2017 WL 2331751 \nat *11 (7th Cir. May 30, 2017). But that is wrong, as explained in Etsitty, 502 F.3d at \n1224,  and  Johnston,  97  F.Supp.3d  at  679–82.  To  dismiss  as  a  “stereotype”  the \nphysiological  distinctions  between  men  and  women—especially  in  places  like \nrestrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  showers—pushes  the  sex-stereotyping  theory  into \nincoherence. See, e.g., Johnston, 97 F. Supp. 3d at 681 (requiring someone to use \nrestroom  of  his  or  her  biological  sex  does  not  allege  discrimination  based  on \n“preconceived notions of gender stereotypes”).   \n  26 \n\nimplementing Title IX explicitly permit … separate toilet, locker room, \nand shower facilities on the basis of sex”). \nIII.  Grimm Is Not Entitled To A Preliminary Injunction. \nGrimm  lastly  argues  that  this  Court  should  direct  entry  of  a \npreliminary injunction. To obtain a preliminary injunction, “the plaintiff \nmust establish ‘[1] that he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he \nis likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n[3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction \nis in the public interest.’” Real Truth About Obama, Inc. v. Fed. Election \nComm’n,  575  F.3d  342,  346  (4th  Cir.  2009)  (alterations  in  original) \n(citation omitted). “[A]ll four requirements must be satisfied.” Id. Grimm \nhas not met that standard. \nFirst, Grimm cannot demonstrate likelihood of success. As to Title \nIX, as shown supra, the Board was plainly permitted by law to determine \nGrimm’s sex based on birth and physiology, and nothing compelled the \nBoard to rely on Grimm’s gender identity or transgender status. Grimm’s \nnew birth certificate—contrary to the assertion that it makes likelihood \nof success “overwhelming,” Grimm Supp. Br. at 48—has no relevance \nhere under the governing Title IX standards. Supp. Br. at 11 n.5, 21 n.7. \n  27 \n\nEven  if  it  did,  Grimm’s own claims  have  never  depended  on  a  birth \ncertificate, and Grimm “may not now raise an entirely new theory in this \ncourt” supporting a preliminary injunction motion. Sys. Operations, Inc. \nv. Sci. Games Dev. Corp., 555 F.2d 1131, 1144 (3d Cir. 1977); see also \nMuth v. United States, 1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir. 1993) (considering newly \nraised arguments “only in very limited circumstances”). \nGrimm also asserts likelihood of success on the Equal Protection \nclaim, Grimm Supp. Br. at 48–50, but the Board has already shown in its \nbrief as appellee why that claim has no merit. See Doc. 47 at 12–30. The \nBoard’s policy does not classify Grimm based on transgender status; it \nimpartially separates individuals based on physiological criteria, as the \nEqual Protection Clause unequivocally allows. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, \n550 n.19; Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 63, 68, 73 (2001).  \nNor  would  Grimm  prevail  if  the  policy  did  effect  such  a \nclassification.  It  is  not  evident  that  transgender  individuals  form  a \n“quasi-suspect” class subject to heightened scrutiny, as Grimm asserts. \nGrimm  Supp.  Br.  at  48–49.  Rather,  Grimm’s  own  expert  describes \ntransgender  persons  as  a  diverse  group  with  different  needs  and \ncharacteristics,  whose  treatment  requires  individualized  medical \n  28 \n\nattention. JA38 (Ettner Decl.). The Supreme Court has declined to treat \nsuch groups as protected classes. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., 473 U.S. 432, 442–43 (1985); Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987); see also Etsitty, 502 F.3d at 1222 (holding transgender individuals \nare not a protected class under Title VII). Even assuming heightened \nscrutiny,  the  Board’s  policy  need  only  be  “substantially  related  to  a \nlegitimate state interest,” Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. at 441 (quotes \nomitted)—a  standard  it  satisfies  because  of  “society’s  undisputed \napproval of separate public rest rooms for men and women based on \nprivacy concerns.” Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 232; Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117, \n1119 (4th Cir. 1981); see also Johnston, 97 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (dismissing \ntransgender student’s Equal Protection claim on that ground). At any \nrate, the district court has never addressed Grimm’s Equal Protection \nclaim and so the better course is for the district court to address it first \non remand in the context of the Board’s still-pending motion to dismiss. \nSecond, Grimm has not established likelihood of irreparable harm \nin  the  absence  of  a  preliminary  injunction.  As  explained  in  Part  I, \nGrimm’s request for a preliminary injunction will be moot when Grimm \ngraduates.  Given  that  Grimm’s  alleged  potential  injuries  are  too \n  29 \n\nuncertain even to be justiciable, they are insufficient as a matter of law \nto  support  the  required  “clear  showing  that  [Grimm]  is  likely  to  be \nirreparably harmed absent preliminary relief.” Real Truth About Obama, \n575 F.3d at 347. \nBecause Grimm has not established likelihood of either success on \nthe merits or irreparable injury, the other two preliminary injunction \nfactors—balance of the equities and the public interest—are beside the \npoint. Suffice to say that until challenged by a plaintiff with justiciable \nclaims,  the  public  interest  and  equities  call  for  allowing  local \ngovernmental bodies to maintain their policies without interference. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  district  court’s  decision  dismissing  Grimm’s  Title  IX  claim \nshould be affirmed or the appeal dismissed as moot.   \n  30 \n\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n    /s/   S.

On September 4, 2015, the Court denied the Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction.ECFNo. 53.This opinion memorializes the reasons forthese orders.\nII. MOTION TO DISMISS\nA. StandardofReview\nThe function of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is to test \"the sufficiency ofa\ncomplaint.\" Occupy Columbia v. Halev. 738 F.3d 107, 116 (4th Cir. 2013). \"[Pmportantly, it\ndoes not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of\ndefenses.\" Republican Party ofN.C. v. Martin. 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992). \"To survive\nsuch a motion, the complaint must allege facts sufficient 'to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level' and 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'\" Halev. 738 F.3d at\n116. When reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the Court must accept \"all well-\npleaded allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true\" and draw \"all reasonable factual\ninferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor.\" Edwards v. City ofGoldsboro. 178 F.3d 231,\n244 (4th Cir. 1999). Legal conclusions, on the other hand, are not entitled to the assumption of\ntruth ifthey are not supported by factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal. 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\nHowever, a motion to dismiss should be granted only in \"very limited circumstances.\" Rogers v.\nJefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co.. 883 F.2d 324, 325 (4th Cir. 1989).\nB. Count II-Title IX\nG.G. also alleges that the School Board's bathroom policy violates Title IX.

Compl. H34. G.G. alleges\nthat this exclusion from the boys' bathroom based on his gender identity constitutes sex\ndiscrimination under Title IX. Compl. Ifi] 64, 65.\n1. Arguments\nThe parties contest whether discrimination based on gender identity is barred under Title\nIX. To support their respective contentions, both parties cite to cases interpreting Title VII, upon\nwhich courts have routinely relied in determining the breadth ofTitle IX. See Jennings v. Univ.\nofN.C. 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) (\"We look to case law interpreting Title VII ofthe\nCivil Rights Act of1964for guidance in evaluatinga claim brought under Title IX.\").\nThe School Board argues that sex discrimination does not include discrimination based\non gender identity. For support, the School Board cites Johnston v. University of Pittsburgh of\nCommonwealth System ofHigher Education. — F. Supp. 3d — , 2015 WL 1497753 (W.D. Pa.\nMar. 31, 2015). In Johnston, the Western District ofPennsylvania found that a policy separating\nthe bathrooms by birth sex at the University of Pittsburgh did not violate Title IX because sex\n8\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 9 of 26 PageID# 692\ndiscrimination does not include discrimination against transgender individuals. 2015 WL\n1497753, at *12-19. The School Boardasserts that Johnston establishesthat Title IX does not\nincorporate discrimination basedongenderortransgender status.\nIn response, G.G. maintains that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on\ngender. G.G. cites to a number ofTitle VII cases inwhich courts have found sexdiscrimination\nto include genderdiscrimination. See, e.g., Glennv. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.\n2011); Smith v. Citvof Salem. 378 F.3d566,574-75 (6thCir. 2004); Finklev. Howard Cntv..\nMd.. 12 F.Supp. 3d780, 788 (D. Md. 2014); Lopez v. River OaksImaging & Diagnostic Grp.,\nInc.. 542F. Supp. 2d 653,660 (S.D.Tex. 2008); seealsoSchwenk v. Hartford. 204F.3d 1187,\n1201 (9th Cir. 2000) ('\"[S]ex' under Title VII encompasses both sex—that is, the biological\ndifferences between men and women—and gender.\").\nIn addition, G.G. contends that the cases Johnston cited to support its proposition, Ulane\nv. E. Airlines. Inc.. 742 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984), and, Sommers v. Budget Mktg.. Inc.. 667 F.2d\n748 (8th Cir. 1982), cert denied. 471 U.S. 1017 (1985),5 are no longer good law. In both Ulane\nand Sommers, the courts refused to extend sex discrimination to include discrimination against\ntransgender individuals or those with nonconforming gender types. However, G.G. asserts that\nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins. 490 U.S. 228 (1989), overruled these cases. In Price Waterhouse.\nthe Supreme Court considered a Title VII claim based on allegations that an employee at Price\nWaterhouse was denied partnership because she was considered \"macho\" and \"overcompensated\nfor being a woman.\" 490 U.S. at 235. She had been advised to \"walk more femininely, talk more\n5ThemorerecentcaseJohnston citesisaTenthCircuitcase,inwhichthecourtavoideddecidingtheissue.\nEtsittv v. Utah Transit Auth.. 502 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"This court need not decide whether\ndiscrimination based on an employee's failure to conform to sex stereotypes always constitutes discrimination\n'because ofsex' and we need not decide whether such a claim may extend Title Vll protection to transsexuals who\nactand appearasamemberofthe oppositesex.\").\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 10 of 26 PageID# 693\nfemininely, dress more femininely, wearmake-up, have her hairstyled, and wear jewelry.\" Id.\nThe Court found that such comments were indicative of gender stereotyping, which Title VII\nprohibited assexdiscrimination. TheCourtexplained that\nwe are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate\nemployees by assuming or insisting that they matched the\nstereotype associated with their group, for '[i]n forbidding\nemployersto discriminate against individualsbecause of their sex,\nCongress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate\ntreatment ofmen and women resulting from sex stereotypes.'\nId at 251 (quoting L.A. Pent, of Water& Powerv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707n.13 (1978)).\nAccordingly, the Court found that \"an employer who acts on the basis ofa belief that a woman\ncannotbeaggressive,orthat she must notbe\" hasactedon thebasisofsex. Id.at 251.\nOther courts have found that Price Waterhouse overruled the cases cited in Johnston.\n\"[S]ince the decision in Price Waterhouse, federal courts have recognized with near-total\nuniformity that 'the approach in . . . Sommers, and Ulane ... has been eviscerated' by Price\nWaterhouse's holding.\" Glenn. 663 F.3d at 1318 n.5 (quoting City ofSalem, 378 F.3d at 573));\nsee also Schwenk, 204 F.3d at 1201 (\"The initial judicial approach taken in cases such as\nHollowav has been overruled by the logic and language of Price Waterhouse.\"); Lopez, 542 F.\nSupp. 2d at 660. Based on Price Waterhouse and its progeny, G.G. claims that discrimination\nagainst transgender individuals or other nonconforming gender types is now prohibited as a form\nof sex discrimination. Accordingly, G.G. asserts that the Resolution's differentiation between\nstudents who have a gender identity congruent with their birth sex, and those who do not,\namounts to sex discrimination under Title IX.\n2. Analysis\nAlthough the primary contention between the parties is whether gender discrimination\nfits within the definition ofsex discrimination under Title IX, G.G.'s claim does not rest on this\n10\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 11 of 26 PageID# 694\ndistinction.Rather,theCourtconcludesthatG.G.'s Title IXclaim is precludedbyDepartmentof\nEducation regulations. Asnoted above, Title IX provides that \"[n]operson intheUnited States\nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected todiscrimination under any education program oractivity receiving Federal financial\nassistance \" 20 U.S.C. § 1681. However, this prohibition on sex-based decision making is\nnot without exceptions. Among the exceptions listed in Title IX is a provision stating that\n\"nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving\nfunds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different\nsexes.\"20U.S.C. § 1686. Although the statute does not expressly state that educational\ninstitutions may maintain separate bathrooms for the differentsexes, Department of Education\nregulations stipulate:\nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower\nfacilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for\nstudents ofone sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided\nfor students ofthe othersex.\n34 C.F.R. § 106.33. This regulation (hereinafter, \"Section 106.33\") expressly allows schools to\nprovide separate bathroom facilities basedupon sex,so longas the bathrooms are comparable.\nWhenCongressdelegatesauthorityto anyagencyto\"elucidatea specific provisionofthestatute\nby regulation, any ensuing regulation is binding on the courts unless procedurally defective,\narbitraryor capriciousin substance,or manifestlycontraryto the statute.\" UnitedStatesv. Mead\nCorp.. 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001). The Department of Education's regulation is not \"arbitrary,\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\"6 Rather, Section 106.33 seems to effectuate\nTitle IX's provision allowing separate living facilities based on sex. Therefore, Section 106.33\n6Itissignificant that neither party raised, norevenhinted atraising, achallenge tothevalidity of Section\n106.33 underTitle IX.\n7Theterm\"living facilities\" in20U.S.C. §1686 isambiguous, and legislative history ofTitle IXdoes not\n11\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 12 of 26 PageID# 695\nis given controlling weight.\nInlight of Section 106.33, G.G. fails to state a valid claim under Title IX. G.G. alleges\nthat the School Board violated Title IX by preventing him from using the boys' restrooms\ndespite the fact that his gender identity ismale. Compl. 1ffl 64, 65. According toG.G., the School\nBoard's determination was based on the belief that Plaintiff is biologically female, not\nbiologically male.8 ]d H65. However, Section 106.33 specifically allows schools to maintain\nseparate bathrooms based on sex as long as the bathrooms for each sex are comparable.\nTherefore, the School Board did not run afoul of Title IX by limiting G.G. to the bathrooms\nassigned to his birth sex.\nIn fact, the onlywayto squareG.G.'s allegations with Section 106.33 is to interpret the\nuseoftheterm\"sex\" in Section 106.33tomeanonly\"gender identity.\" Underthis interpretation,\nSection 106.33 would permit the use of separate bathrooms on the basisof genderidentity and\nnot on the basis of birth or biological sex. However, under any fair reading, \"sex\" in Section\n106.33clearly includesbiological sex. Becausethe School Board's policy ofprovidingseparate\nbathrooms on the basis ofbiological sex is permissible under the regulation, the Court need not\ndecide whether\"sex\" in the Section 106.33 also includes \"gender identity.\"\nInstead,the Court need only decide whether theSchool Board's bathroom policysatisfies\nSection 106.33. Section 106.33 states that sex-segregated bathrooms are permissible unless such\nprovide clear guidance asto itsmeaning. This termcouldbenarrowly interpreted tomean livingquarters, suchas\ndormitories, oritcouldbebroadlyinterpreted to includeotherfacilities, suchasbathrooms. See ImplementingTitle\nIX: The New Regulations. 124U. Pa.L. Rev. 806, 811 (1976). Because the Department ofEducation's inclusion of\nbathrooms within\"living facilities\" is reasonable, the Court defers to its interpretation. See Chevron. U.S.A.. Inc.v.\nNat. Res. Def. Council. Inc.. 467 U.S. 837, 842^14 (1984).\n8The Court issensitiveto the fact theG.G.disapproves ofthe School Board'sterm\"biological gender.\"\nSee Compl. f 66 (placingbiological in dismissive quotationmarks).G.G. may also take issue with the Court's\nphrase biological sex. The Court is guided in its usage by the APA \"Definition ofTerms: Sex, Gender, Gender\nIdentity,SexualOrientation\" from2011, whichthe School Boardsubmittedwith its BriefinOppositionto Motion\nfor Preliminary Injunction. Ex. 3, ECF No. 30. The APA defines \"sex\" as \"a person's biological status,\" and\nidentifies\"a numberofindicators ofbiological sex.\" UL\n12\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 13 of 26 PageID# 696\nfacilities are not comparable. G.G. fails to allege that the bathrooms to which he is allowed\naccess by the School Board—the girls' restrooms and the single-stall restrooms—are\nincomparable to those provided for individuals who are biologically male. In fact, noneof the\nallegations in the Complaint even mention or imply that the facilities in the bathrooms are not\ncomparable.Consequently,G.G. failsto stateaclaimunderTitle IX.\nNonetheless, despite Section 106.33, the Government urges the Court to defer to the\nDepartment of Education's interpretation of Title IX, which maintains that a policy that\nsegregates bathrooms basedon biological sex and withoutregard for students' genderidentities\nviolates Title IX. Insupport ofits position, the Government attaches a letter(the \"Letter\"), dated\nJanuary 7, 2015, issued by the Department of Education, through the Office for Civil Rights,\napparently clarifying its stance on the treatment of transgender students with regard to sex-\nsegregated restrooms. Statement ofInterest 9, ECFNo. 28; id Ex. B, at 2, ECFNo. 28-2. In the\nLetter, the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy for the Department of Education's\nOffice ofCivil Rights, writes:\nThe Department's Title IX regulations permit schools to provide\nsex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, housing,\nathletic teams, and single-sex classes under certain circumstances.\nWhen a school elects to separate or treat students differently on the\nbasis of sex in those situations, a school must treat transgender\nstudents consistent with theirgender identity.\nId. at 9-10, Ex. B, at 2. The Letter cites a Department of Education significant guidance\ndocument (the \"Guidance Document\") published in 2014 in support of this interpretation.\nAccording to the Guidance Document:\nUnder Title IX, a recipient must generally treat transgender\nstudents consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the\nplanning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of\nsingle-sex classes.\n13\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 14 of 26 PageID# 697\nSee Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and Answers onTitle IXand\nSingle-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities 25 (Dec. 1, 2014).\nDespite the fact that Section 106.33 has been in effect since 1975,9 the Department ofEducation\ndoesnotciteanydocuments published before 2014tosupport theinterpretation itnowadopts.\nThe Department of Education's interpretation does not stand up to scrutiny. Unlike\nregulations, interpretations in opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and\nenforcement guidelines \"do not warrant Chevron-style deference\" with regard to statutes.\nChristensen v. Harris Cntv.. 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000). Therefore, the interpretations in the Letter\nand the Guidance Document cannot supplant Section 106.33. Nonetheless, these documents can\ninform the meaning of Section 106.33. An agency's interpretation of its own regulation, even\none contained inan opinion letteror a guidancedocument,is given controllingweight if (1) the\nregulation is ambiguous and (2) the interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with\ntheregulation. ]d at 588(\"Auer deference iswarrantedonly when the languageoftheregulation\nis ambiguous.\"); Auer v. Robbins. 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (\"[The agency's] interpretationof\n[its own regulation] is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless plainly erroneous or\ninconsistent with the regulation.\").\nUpon review, the Department of Education's interpretation should not be given\ncontrolling weight. To begin with, Section 106.33 is not ambiguous. Itclearly allows the School\nBoard to limit bathroom access \"on the basis of sex,\" including birth or biological sex.\nFurthermore, the Department ofEducation's interpretation ofSection 106.33 is plainly erroneous\nand inconsistent with the regulation. Even under the most liberal reading, \"on the basis ofsex\" in\nSection 106.33 means both \"on the basis ofgender\" and \"on the basis ofbiological sex.\"It does\n9TitleIXregulations were promulgated bytheDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare in1975 and\nadopted by the DepartmentofEducation upon itsestablishment in 1980.45 Fed.

Itdoes not, however, require\nthat sex-segregated bathrooms be separated on the basis of gender, rather than on the basis of\nbirthor biological sex.Genderdiscrimination did notsuddenly supplant sex discrimination as a\nresult ofPrice Waterhouse; it supplemented it.\nTodefertotheDepartment ofEducation's newfound interpretation would benothing less\nthantoallowthe Department of Education to\"createdefacto a newregulation\" through theuse\nof a mere letterand guidancedocument. See Christensen,529 U.S. at 588. If the Departmentof\nEducationwishes to amend its regulations, it is ofcourse entitled to do so. However,it must go\nthrough notice andcomment rulemaking, as required bythe Administrative Procedure Act.See\n5 U.S.C.§553.

Such a precedent would be dangerous and could open the door to allow further\nattempts to circumvent the rule of law—further degrading our well-designed system ofchecks\nand balances.\nIn light ofSection 106.33, the Court cannot find that the School Board's bathroom policy\nviolates Title IX.\nIII.

ARGUMENTSOFTHE PARTIES AND FACTS IN EVIDENCE\nG.G. characterizes the question ofcompeting hardships as \"not a close question.\" Mem.\ninSupp. ofMot. forPrelim. Inj., 40,ECFNo. 18 (\"Prelim. Inj.\"). Heargues thatthisCourtmust\nweigh \"the severe, documented, and scientifically supported harms\" that the restroom policy\ncontinues to inflict upon G.G, who has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, against the\n\"School Board's unfounded speculation about harms that might occur to others at some future\ndate.\" Id. The School Board by contrast implores this Court to consider the safety and privacy\ninterests ofall its students. Br. in Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF No. 30. It emphasizes\nthat while litigation is ongoing, G.G. may use the \"girls' restroom, the three single-stall\nrestrooms, or the restroom in the nurse's office.\" Id.\n1. Facts and Arguments Concerning the Hardship to G.G.\nG.G. relies on two declarations to establish the hardships he would suffer should this\nCourt deny his Motion for Preliminary Injunction. ECF Nos. 9, 10. G.G.'s Declaration largely\nrepeats the material in his complaint. Compare ECF Nos. 8 and 9. The Court recounts only those\nassertions that concern the effect that G.G.'s Gender Dysphoria has had on his schooling. G.G.\nalleges other harms he has suffered, such as being humiliated and forced to speak at the School\nBoard hearing, G.G. Decl. ^ 23, but these harms are not relevant to the issuance ofan injunction\nallowing G.G. to use the male restroom during this litigation. Here the declaration ofG.G. is a\nrecital of the allegations in the complaint and is replete with inadmissible evidence including\nthoughts of others, hearsay, and suppositions. The Court recounts these allegations before\nanalyzing theircredibility.\nG.G. claims that during his freshman year, which began in September 2013, he\n18\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 19 of 26 PageID# 702\n\"experienced severe depression and anxiety related tohis untreated Gender Dysphoria.\" Id ^ 9.\nThe depression and anxiety were so severe that G.G. did not attend school during the spring\nsemester which began in January 2014. Id. There is nothing to corroborate that his\"untreated\nGender Dysphoria\" was the reason for hisabsence. In April of2014, weeks before hisfifteenth\nbirthday, G.G. first informed hisparents that heistransgender. Id ^ 10. After his parents learned\nof his gender identity, G.G. began \"therapy with a psychologist who had experience with\nworking with transgender patients.\" Jd He claims that this psychologist diagnosed him with\nGender Dysphoria and recommended that he beginto liveas a boy in all respects, including in\nhis use of the restroom. Id ^ 11. There is no report or declaration from this psychologist. In\nAugust 2014, G.G. and his mother informed officials at Gloucester High School of his gender\nidentity. ]d ^ 15 Atthestart of theschool year, G.G. agreed to use a separate restroom inthe\nnurse's office. Id. U19.G.G. then determined that it \"was not necessary to continue to use the\nnurse's restroom.\" Id. He claims that he\"found itstigmatizing to use aseparate restroom.\" Id.\nOn December 9, 2014, the School Board adopted the restroom policy. Id U22. With the\nnew transgender restroom policy, G.G. feels like he has been \"stripped of [his] privacy and\ndignity.\" Id %23. Heis unwillingto usethe girls' restroombecause, heclaims, girlsand women\nobject to his presence there. Id ^ 25. Additionally, use of the girls' restroom would be\nincompatible with his treatment for Gender Dysphoria. Id He claims that the new unisex\nrestrooms are not located near his classes and that only one of these restrooms is located near\nwhere the single-sex restrooms are located. Id U26. He refuses to use these restrooms because\n\"they make him feel even more stigmatized and isolated than when [he] use[d] the restroom in\nthe nurse's office.\" Id ^ 27. He claims that everyone knows that the restrooms were installed for\nhim. Id. Because G.G. refuses to use any ofthe restrooms permitted for his use, he has held his\n19\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 20 of 26 PageID# 703\nurineanddeveloped urinarytract infections. Id.^ 28.\nThe Expert Declaration ofRandi Ettner, Ph.D, adds little tothese factual claims. Ettner is\nnot the psychologist who analyzed G.G. after he first told his parents he was transgender; rather,\nhewas retained by G.G.'s counsel in preparation for thislitigation. See Ettner Decl. ffl| 1,7, 9.\nEttnermet G.G. oncebeforepreparinghis report. Id 1 7. The bulk ofhis declaration describes\nthe diagnosis and treatment ofGender Dysphoria. Itdefines Gender Dysphoria asthe feeling of\nincongruence between one's gender identity and thesex assigned oneat birth. Id fflj 11-12. It\nnotes that Gender Dysphoria is \"codified in the Diagnostic and Statistical [MJanual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM-V) (American Psychiatric Association) and the International Classifications of\nDiseases-10 (World Health Organization).\" Id ^ 12. It describes the studies that have lookedat\ntransgender youth who could notuserestrooms corresponding totheirgender identity. l± ffll 18-\n27.However, beyond confirmingthat G.G.hasa\"severe degreeof GenderDysphoria,\" id ^| 29,\nthere are no facts particularto G.G. in the report. See id.1fl[28-30.\nThe School Board, supported by the declarationofTroy Andersen, emphasizes that any\nstudent may use the three unisex restrooms that were installed and open for use by\nDecember 16,2014. Andersen Decl. H7; Br. in Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF No. 30.\nAny student may also use the restroom in the nurse's office. Andersen Decl. U7. Moreover, the\nSchool Board contends that G.G. may use the female restrooms and locker rooms, Br. in Opp'n\nto Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18,ECF No. 30, and G.G. has made no showing that he is not permitted\nto use them.\n2. Facts and Arguments Concerning Student Privacy\nThe School Board contends that granting the preliminary injunction and allowing G.G. to\nuse the male restroom would endanger the safety and privacy ofother students. Br. in Opp'n to\nMot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF No. 30. G.G. argues in response, without any independent factual\n20\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 21 of 26 PageID# 704\nsupport, thathispresence inthemalerestroom wouldnotinfringe upontheprivacy rights of his\nfellow students. He claims that the student body itself is comfortable with his presence in the\nrestroom because during the seven weeks in which he used the male restroom, he \"never\nencountered any problems from other students.\" G.G. Decl. 1J 20. The Andersen Declaration\ndescribes a different reaction to G.G.'s use ofthe male restroom. Andersen Decl. H4. According\nto Andersen, the School Board \"began receiving numerous complaints from parents and\nstudents\" theday afterG.G. was granted permission to usethe boys' bathroom. ]d\nG.G. also contends that the improvements that the School Board made to the restrooms\nalleviated any concerns that parents or students may have had about \"nudity involving students\nof different sexes.\" Prelim. Inj. at 33. His complaint describes these improvements, which\ninclude raising the doors and walls around the bathroom stalls so that students cannot see into an\nadjoining stall, and adding three unisex, single-stall restrooms. Compl. ffi[ 47, 52. The School\nBoard disputes the extent to which the improvements have increased privacy and claims that the\nrestrooms, \"and specifically the urinals,\" are \"not completely private,\" although it also does not\nsubmit any evidence in support ofthis contention. Br. in Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18 n.17,\nECF No. 30.\nFinally, G.G. argues that any student uncomfortable with his presence in the male\nrestrooms may use the new unisex restrooms. Prelim. Inj. at 35, 39.\nC. Analysis\nG.G.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction asks this Court to allow him, a natal female, to\nuse the male restroom at Gloucester High School. Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 11. Restrooms\nand locker rooms are designed differently because of the biological differences between the\nsexes. See Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"differences between the genders\ndemand a facility for each gender that is different\"). Male restrooms, for instance, contain\n21\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 22 of 26 PageID# 705\nurinals, while female restroomsdo not. Men tend to prefer urinals becauseof the convenience.\nFurthermore, society demands that male and female restrooms be separatebecause of privacy\nconcerns. Id; see also Virginia v. United States. 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.16 (1996) (\"[admitting\nwomen to VMI would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to affordmembers of eachsex\nprivacy from the other sex in living arrangements\"). The Court must consider G.G.'s claims of\nstigma and distress against the privacy interests of the other students protected by separate\nrestrooms.\nIn protecting the privacy of the other students, the School Board is protecting a\nconstitutional right. The Fourth Circuithas recognized thatprisoners havea constitutional right\nto bodily privacy. Lee v. Downs. 641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir. 1981). Although the Fourth\nCircuit has never held that the right to bodily privacy applies to all individuals, it would be\nperverse to suppose that prisoners, who forfeit so many privacy rights, nevertheless gained a\nconstitutional right to bodily privacy. In recognizingthe right ofprisoners to bodily privacy the\ncourt spoke in universal terms: \"Most people... have a special sense of privacy in their own\ngenitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be\nespecially demeaning and humiliating.\" Id\nSeveral circuits have recognized the right to bodily privacy outside the context of\nprisonerlitigation. Doev. LuzerneCounty,660 F.3d 169,177 (3d Cir.2011)(holdingthatbodily\nexposure may meet \"the lofty constitutional standard\" and constitute a violation of one's\nreasonableexpectationof privacy); Brannum v. OvertonCounty School Bd., 516 F.3d489, 494\n(6th Cir. 2008) (holding that a student's \"constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses\nthe right not to be videotaped while dressing and undressing in school athletic locker rooms\");\nPoe v. Leonard. 282 F.3d 123, 138-39 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"there is a right to privacy in one's\n22\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 23 of 26 PageID# 706\nunclothedor partiallyunclothed body\"); Yorkv. Story.324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963)(\"We\ncannot conceive of a more basic subject of privacy than the naked body.\"). In these circuits,\nviolations ofthe right to bodily privacy are most acute when one's body is exposed to a member\nof the opposite sex. See Doe, 660 F.3d at 177 (considering whether \"Doe's body parts were\nexposed to members of the opposite sex\" in deciding whether her reasonable expectation of\nprivacy was violated); Brannum, 516 F.3d at 494 (\"the constitutional right to\nprivacy... includes the right to shield one's body from exposure to viewing by the opposite\nsex\"); York, 324 F.2d at 455 (highlighting that the exposed plaintiffwas female and the viewing\ndefendant male); Poe, 282 F.3d at 138 (citing with approval the Ninth Circuit's emphasis on the\ndifferent genders ofdefendant and plaintiffin York).\nNot only is bodily privacy a constitutional right, the need for privacy is even more\npronouncedinthestateeducationalsystem.Thestudentsarealmostall minors,and publicschool\neducation is a protective environment. Furthermore,the School Board is tasked with providing\nsafeand appropriatefacilitiesforthese students.Linnonv. Commonwealth,752 S.E.2d822, 826\n(Va. 2014) (finding that \"school administrators have a responsibility 'to supervise and ensure\nthat students could have an education in an atmosphere conducive to learning, free ofdisruption,\nand threat to person.'\" (quoting Burns v. Gaenon. 727 S.E.2d 634, 643 (Va. 2012)).\nG.G.'s unsupported claims, which are mostly inadmissible hearsay, fail to show that his\npresence in the male restroom would not infringe upon the privacy of other students. G.G.'s\nclaim that he \"never encountered any problems from other students,\" G.G. Decl. U20, is directly\ncontradicted by the Andersen Declaration. Andersen Decl. U4. Moreover, even if the Court\naccepted G.G.'s self-serving assertion, it would still not find that there was no discomfort among\nthe students. It would not be surprising if students, rather than confronting G.G. himself,\n23\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 24 of 26 PageID# 707\nexpressed theirdiscomfort totheir parents who then went totheSchool Board.\nG.G. furthercontends that the improvements thatthe School Board made to the restrooms\nminimize any privacy concerns. Prelim. Inj. at 33. However, G.G. does not introduce any\nevidence that would help the Court understand the extent of the improvements. He fails to\nrecognize that no amount of improvements to the urinals can make them completely private\nbecause people sometimes turnwhile closing theirpants. Hedoesnotsubmit anyevidence that\nwould show that other students would be comfortable with his presence in the male restroom\nbecauseofthe improvements. Finally, he fails to recognize that the School Board's interests go\nbeyond preventing most exposures of genitalia. Themere presence of a member of theopposite\nsex in the restroom may embarrass many students and be felt a violation of their privacy.\nAccordingly, theprivacy concerns of the School Board donotdiminish inproportion to thesize\nofthe stall doors.\nG.G.'s argument that other students may use the unisex restrooms if they are\nuncomfortable with his presence in the male restroom unintentionally reveals the hardship that\nthe injunction he seeks would impose on other students. It does not occur to G.G. that other\nstudents may experience feelings ofexclusion when they can no longer use the restrooms they\nwere accustomed to using because they feel that G.G.'s presence in the male restroom violates\ntheir privacy. He would have any number ofstudents use the unisex restrooms rather than use\nthem himselfwhile this Court resolves his novel constitutional challenge.\nG.G.'s dismissal of the School Board's privacy concerns only makes sense if assumes\nthat there are fewer or no privacy concerns when a student shares a restroom with another\nstudent ofdifferent birth sex but the same gender identity. Ifthere were no privacy concerns in\nthis situation, there would be no hardship if G.G. used the male restroom while this litigation\n24\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 25 of 26 PageID# 708\nproceeds. Of course, this litigation is proof that not everyone—certainly not the Gloucester\nCounty School Board—shares inthisbelief. TheCourt gives greatweight totheconcerns ofthe\nSchool Board—which represents thestudents andparents inthecommunity—on thequestion of\nthe privacy concerns of students, especially at this early stage of litigation andin the complete\nabsence ofcredible evidence to the contrary.\nAgainst the School Board's stronginterest in protecting student privacy, the Courtmust\nconsider G.G.'s largely unsubstantiated claims of hardship.G.G. acknowledges that he may use\nthe unisex restrooms or the nurse's restroom. His declaration fails to articulate the specific harms\nthat would occur to him ifhe uses those restrooms while this litigation proceeds; it simply says\nthat usingthese restrooms would cause him distress and make him feel stigmatized. It is telling\nto the Court that his declaration mirrors his complaint, a sign that it was drafted by his lawyers\nand notby him.G.G.attempts to support hisclaimsofdistressbydescribingthe diagnosisofthe\nfirstpsychologist whosawhim,buttheseallegations arehearsayandwillnotbeconsidered.\nSimilarly,G.G.makesseveralclaimsaboutthethoughtsand feelingsofotherstudentsfor\nwhich he has not submitted any admissible evidence or corroboration. He has nothing to\nsubstantiate his claims that other students view the unisex restrooms as designed solely for him.\nNor has he submitted a layout of the school that would confirm his claim that the unisex\nrestrooms are inconvenient for him to use.\nThe declaration of Dr. Ettner is almost completely devoid of facts specific to G.G.\nDr. Ettner is not the psychologist who allegedly first diagnosed G.G. with Gender Dysphoria.\nRather, he has been retained for this litigation. Having met G.G. only once, he has little to say\nabout the harm that would occur to G.G. specifically if G.G. is not allowed to use the male\nrestrooms during this litigation.\n25\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 57   Filed 09/17/15   Page 26 of 26 PageID# 709\nG.G. hasbeengivenanoption of using a restroom inadditiontothe female restroom that\ncorresponds to his biological sex. He has not described his hardship in concrete terms and has\nsupported hisclaimswithnothingmorethanhis owndeclaration and thatof a psychologist who\nmet himonly once, forthe purpose oflitigation and not fortreatment. The School Boardseeks to\nprotect an interest in bodily privacy that the Fourth Circuit has recognized as a constitutional\nright while G.G. seeks to overturn a long tradition ofsegregating bathrooms based on biological\ndifferences between the sexes. Because G.G. has failed to show that the balance of hardships\nweighs in his favor, an injunction is not warranted while the Court considers this claim.\nHaving found that G.G. has not shown that the balance of the hardships are in his favor,\nthe Court docs not need to consider the other showings required for a preliminary injunction.\nHowever, the Court notes that just as G.G. has failed to provide adequate proofof the hardship\nthat would occur if the injunction is not granted, he has also failed to make a clear showing of\nirreparable injury.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nfor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTED the Motion to Dismiss as to Count II,\nPlaintiffs claim under Title IX. and DENIED the Plaintiffs Motion for a Preliminary\nInjunction. The Clerk is DIRECTED to forward a copy ofthis Opinion to all Counsel ofRecord.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nhi\n^x\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nNewport Ncws^VA\nSeptember I7, 2015\n26",

D., \n \nAmici Supporting Appellee. \n \n \n \nO R D E R \n \n  Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy, commenced this action against the Gloucester \nCounty School Board in July 2015, alleging that the School Board’s policy of assigning \nstudents  to  restrooms  based  on  their  biological  sex  violated  Title  IX  and  the  Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Shortly thereafter, the district court \nissued a  memorandum opinion and order dated September 17, 2015, (1) dismissing \n4\n \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 107   Filed 08/02/17   Page 5 of 8 PageID# 994\nGrimm’s claim under Title IX for failure to state a claim, and (2) denying his motion for a \npreliminary injunction based on alleged violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection \nClause.  132 F. Supp. 3d 736, 753 (E.D. Va. 2015).   \nIn a decision dated April 19, 2016, we reversed the district court’s dismissal of \nGrimm’s Title IX claim, relying on a guidance document issued by the U.S. Department \nof Education and U.S. Department of Justice.  We also remanded the order denying the \ninjunction, finding that the district court had applied the incorrect evidentiary standard in \nevaluating Grimm’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016).  \nBased on our ruling on Grimm’s Title IX claim, the district court issued an order dated \nJune 23, 2016, granting Grimm’s motion for a preliminary injunction and requiring the \nSchool Board to allow Grimm to use bathrooms designated for males.  2016 WL 3581852 \n(E.D. Va. June 23, 2016).   \nThe School Board filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review our April 2016 \ndecision, and the Supreme Court granted the petition.  137 S. Ct. 369 (2016) (mem.).   \nAfter the Supreme Court calendared the case for argument, the new Administration \nissued  a  guidance  document  on  February  22,  2017,  that  withdrew  the  prior \nAdministration’s guidance document regarding the treatment of transgender students, and \nthe Court then vacated our April 2016 decision and remanded the case to us “for further \nconsideration in  light  of  the  [new]  guidance  document issued  by  the Department  of \nEducation and Department of Justice.”  137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017) (mem.).  In turn, we vacated \nthe district court’s June 23, 2016 preliminary injunction.  853 F.3d 729 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(mem.).   \n5\n \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 107   Filed 08/02/17   Page 6 of 8 PageID# 995\nBecause the Supreme Court vacated our April 2016 decision and we thereafter \nvacated the district court’s June 2016 preliminary injunction, we now have before us on \nappeal the district court’s original memorandum opinion and order dated September 17, \n2015.   \nTo account for intervening events from when Grimm first filed his appeal, the \nparties have submitted supplemental briefs that address several issues that were not before \nus when we previously heard the case or before the district court when it issued its \nSeptember 17, 2015 memorandum opinion and order.  In its supplemental briefing, the \nSchool Board contends that this case has become moot because, after our April 2016 \ndecision, Grimm apparently graduated from high school on June 10, 2017.  The School \nBoard argues that, absent any allegation of a “particular intention to return to school after \ngraduation,” this change of status deprives Grimm of a continued interest in the litigation, \nrendering the case moot.  Supp. Reply Br. of Sch. Bd. at 4; see also Supp. Br. of Sch. Bd. \nat 18–20.  The School Board states further that its bathroom policy does not necessarily \napply to alumni, and that the issue of whether the policy is applicable to alumni is not yet \nripe for adjudication.  In his briefing, Grimm challenges these contentions, arguing that his \npossible “future attendance at alumni and school-community events” establishes a concrete \ninterest in obtaining an injunction, Supp. Br. of Pl.-Appellant at 19, and that the School \nBoard’s “noncommittal statement” regarding the enforceability of its policy “falls far short \nof a representation that the Board will voluntarily cease discriminating against [him].”  \nSupp. Reply Br. of Pl.-Appellant at 4.  The School Board thus suggests an absence of our \njurisdiction, while Grimm contends that we continue to have jurisdiction.  \n6\n \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 107   Filed 08/02/17   Page 7 of 8 PageID# 996\nOf course, at any stage of litigation, a federal court must have jurisdiction to resolve \nthe merits of a dispute, as an absence of jurisdiction deprives a court of the power to act.  \nSee Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975) (“[A]n actual controversy must be extant \nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed”); DeFunis v. Odegaard, \n416 U.S. 312, 316 (1974) (“The inability of the federal judiciary ‘to review moot cases \nderives from the requirement of Art. III of the Constitution’” (quoting Liner v. Jafco, Inc., \n375 U.S. 301, 306 n.3 (1964))).  Because our power may be at issue, we are not free simply \nto avoid the question of whether the case has become moot and proceed to decide the case \non the merits.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 93–95 (1998).  \nJurisdiction, when questioned or when questionable, must always be determined first, as it \nis “always an antecedent question.”  Id. at 101. \nThus, a crucial threshold question arises in this appeal whether “one or both of the \nparties plainly lack a continuing interest” in the resolution of this case such that it has \nbecome moot.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. \n167,  192  (2000).    While  our  jurisdiction  is  thus  questioned, the  facts  on  which  our \njurisdiction could be decided are not in the record before us.  Because all of the prior \nlitigation was conducted while Grimm was a student, the parties have presented us with \nnothing more than unsupported assertions regarding Grimm’s continued connection to his \nhigh school and the applicability of the School Board’s policy.  And our own “analysis of \nthese matters . . . cannot be achieved simply by reviewing the plaintiffs’ pleadings and the \nlimited record on appeal.”  Al Shimari v. CACI Premier Tech., Inc., 758 F.3d 516, 536 (4th \nCir. 2014) (remanding to allow for factfinding related to whether the case presented a \n7\n \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 107   Filed 08/02/17   Page 8 of 8 PageID# 997\nnonjusticiable political question).  Accordingly, we conclude that it is necessary to remand \nthis case to the district court to determine, in the first instance, whether this case has become \nmoot by reason of Grimm’s graduation — a resolution that will likely “require factual \ndevelopment of the record by the district court and possibly additional jurisdictional \ndiscovery.”  Id.; see also 28 U.S.C. § 2106. \nAccordingly,  we  remand  this  to  the  district  court  for  the  limited  purpose  of \nresolving, in the first instance, whether this case has become moot. \nEntered at the direction of Judge Niemeyer, with the concurrence of Judge Duncan \nand Judge Floyd. \n          For the Court \n          /s/ Patricia S. Connor, Clerk \n               \n8\n \n ",

He has \nsocially transitioned and lives his entire life as the boy that he is. He has a \ntreatment documentation letter from his medical providers. He has legally changed \nhis name and obtained a Virginia I.D. card with a male gender marker. He already \nuses the men’s restrooms in restaurants, shopping malls, and governmental \nbuildings throughout Gloucester County. He has male physiological characteristics \nas a result of chest surgery and years of hormone therapy. And for most of his \nsenior year, he even had a Virginia court order and amended birth certificate \nreflecting that he is male. Despite all of this, the Gloucester County School Board \n(the “Board”) claims the authority to declare that Gavin’s “biological gender” is \nfemale and exclude him from using the same common restroom facilities that \nevery other boy is allowed to use. \nThe Board does not attempt to defend its treatment of Gavin as an individual \nor address Gavin’s actual arguments. Instead, the Board spends page after page \narguing that the term “sex” includes reference to physiological characteristics (Def. \nSupp. Br. 23-27), even though Gavin has never argued otherwise. The Board also \npretends that Gavin is seeking to access restrooms based “sole[ly]” on his “internal \nperception of a male gender identity” (id. at 21 n.7 (emphasis in original)), even \nthough Gavin has never argued for such a policy. The Board is preoccupied with \n1 \n   \n\nthe idea of “physiological males” suddenly declaring they have an internal female \ngender identity in order to gain access to women’s locker rooms (id. at 39) or to \ngain a competitive advantage in sports teams (id. at 41). And the Board claims that \nit must banish Gavin from using the same restrooms as other boys in order to \nforestall these imaginary scenarios that have nothing to do with Gavin, nothing to \ndo with restrooms, and nothing to do with the experiences of actual transgender \nstudents.  \nThe Board’s baseless speculation conflicts with the views of every major \nmedical organization,1 school counselors and psychologists,2 and teachers and \nadministrators across the country working with real transgender students as \nopposed to hypothetical ones.3 See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 5-6. While the Board speculates \nabout imaginary scenarios, it willfully blinds itself to the reality that already exists \nin Virginia and throughout the country. Boys and girls who are transgender are \nalready using sex-separated facilities at school,4 participating in interscholastic \n                                                        \n1 See Amicus Br. of Am.

It is willful blindness \nbased on myths of predation, invidious stereotypes, moral disapproval, and \nunfounded fears about people who are different.  \nThe Board’s policy discriminates against Gavin in violation of both Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., and the Equal \nProtection Clause. This Court should reinstate Gavin’s Title IX claim and instruct \nthe district court to issue a preliminary injunction based on both Title IX and the \nFourteenth Amendment. See Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of \nEduc., -- F.3d --, 2017 WL 2331751 (7th Cir. May 30, 2017) (affirming \npreliminary injunction in factually similar case). \n                                                                                                                                                                                   \nadministrators from 33 States and D.C.); Amicus Br. of New York, et al., ECF \n148-1 (brief on behalf of 17 States and D.C.) \n5 Va.

See Boy Scouts of America, BSA Addresses Gender Identity \n(Jan. 30, 2017), https://goo.gl/WxNoGY. \n3 \n   \n\nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Board Cannot Meet Its “Heavy Burden” Of Establishing Mootness.  \nThe burden of establishing mootness rests with the Board. See Adarand \nConstructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 221 (2000). In suggesting that the \nappeal has become moot, the Board does not dispute that, as an alumnus who will \nbe attending a local college in the Gloucester area, Gavin will continue to be \npresent on campus and at alumni activities, football games, and other community \nevents. See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 18-21; Def.’s Supp. Br. 19. But the Board obliquely \nstates that it is not “evident that the Board’s policy even applies to alumni.” Def.’s \nSupp. Br. 19.  \nThat noncommittal statement by counsel falls far short of a representation \nthat the Board will voluntarily cease discriminating against Gavin after he \ngraduates, and it certainly does not satisfy the Board’s “heavy burden of \npersuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to \nstart up again.” Wall v. Wade, 741 F.3d 492, 497 (4th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks and brackets omitted). “[B]ald assertions of a defendant—whether \ngovernmental or private—that it will not resume a challenged policy fail to satisfy \nany burden of showing that a claim is moot.” Id. (footnote omitted). Here, the \nBoard is not even willing to provide bald assertions. \n4 \n   \n\nThe Board also asserts that Gavin would no longer have a cause of action \nunder Title IX after graduation because, according to the Board, the statute does \nnot apply to “non-student alumni” and “non-educational events.” Def.’s Supp. Br. \n19 (emphases in original). Even if that were true—and it is not—the question \nwhether Gavin still has a cause of action under Title IX goes to the merits of his \nclaim, not to mootness. See Chafin v. Chafin, 133 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 (2013). And \neven if the Board’s arguments about the scope of Title IX were relevant to \nmootness, they would not apply to Gavin’s equal protection claim, which provides \nan independent basis for his preliminary injunction motion. \nIn any event, Title IX protects all “person[s],” not merely current students. \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). “Title IX does not limit its coverage at all, outlawing \ndiscrimination against any ‘person,’ broad language the Court has interpreted \nbroadly.” Elwell v. Oklahoma, 693 F.3d 1303, 1311 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.) \n(citation omitted). The statute thus prohibits schools from discriminating against \nemployees on the basis of sex because “employees, like other ‘persons,’ may not \nbe ‘excluded from participation in,’ ‘denied the benefits of,’ or ‘subjected to \ndiscrimination under’ education programs receiving federal financial support.” N. \nHaven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 520 (1982) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a)). The same principle applies here. Alumni, like other “persons,” may not \nbe excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to \n5 \n   \n\ndiscrimination at Gloucester High School on the basis of sex. Cf. United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 552 (1996) (explaining that educational benefits of school \ninclude the social and professional benefits of being an alumnus). \nMoreover, despite the Board’s suggestions to the contrary, Title IX also \napplies to an educational program’s social and extracurricular activities, not merely \nacademics. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8) (permitting “father-son or mother-daughter \nactivities”); 45 C.F.R. § 106.31(a) (defining educational programs to include any \n“extracurricular . . . program and activity”); 45 C.F.R. § 106.34(b) (discussing \nextracurricular activities); 45 C.F.R. § 106.41 (educational program includes club \nand intramural athletics); 45 C.F.R. § 106.51(b)(9) (prohibiting discrimination \nagainst employees with respect to school-sponsored “social or recreational” \nevents). \nBecause Gavin’s appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction is not \nmoot, the Court also retains pendent appellate jurisdiction over the dismissal of \nGavin’s Title IX claim, including his claim for nominal damages. Although the \nBoard speculates that Gavin would not pursue nominal damages (Def.’s Supp. Br. \n19-20), the entire purpose of seeking nominal damages is to ensure continued \nstanding to vindicate civil rights even if injunctive relief becomes moot. Cf. \nMercer v. Duke Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 207 (4th Cir. 2005) (although Title IX \n6 \n   \n\nplaintiff graduated and recovered only nominal damages, her case “marked a \nmilestone in the development of the law under Title IX”). \nII.  Gavin Has Stated A Claim Under Title IX. \nA.  Under Title IX, discrimination based on transgender status is a \nform of discrimination on the basis of sex. \nAs explained in Gavin’s supplemental brief (Pl.’s Supp. Br. 21-26), \ndiscriminating against individuals because they are transgender—that is, because \ntheir gender identity is different from the sex assigned to them at birth—is literally \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.” Regardless of whether the discrimination is \nconceived of as discrimination based on sexual characteristics, discrimination \nbased on change of sex, or discrimination based on gender nonconformity, it is \nimpossible to discriminate against a person for being transgender without taking \nthe impermissible “criterion” of “sex” into account. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, \n490 U.S. 228, 248 (1989) (plurality); id. at 262 (O’Connor, J., concurring); id. at \n282 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); see also Whitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *9 (joining \ncircuit consensus). None of the Board’s statutory arguments can overcome that \nsimple fact.7  \n                                                        \n7 The Supreme Court interprets the term “sex” in Title IX in accordance with \nprecedent interpreting “sex” in Title VII. See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581, 616 n.1 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. \nSch., 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992). \n7 \n   \n\nFirst, the Board stubbornly insists that applying Title IX to this type of sex \ndiscrimination would improperly “define” sex as “gender identity,” to the \nexclusion of all physiological characteristics. Def.’s Supp. Br. 23-26. To the \ncontrary, far from excluding physiological characteristics, a person’s transgender \nstatus reflects the interrelationship between a person’s gender identity and the \nphysiological characteristics that caused that person to be assigned a different sex \nat birth. “[D]iscrimination on the basis of gender stereotypes, or on the basis of \nbeing transgender, or intersex, or sexually indeterminate, constitutes discrimination \non the basis of the properties or characteristics typically manifested in sum as male \nand female—and that discrimination is literally discrimination” on the basis of \n“sex.” Fabian v. Hosp. of Cent. Conn., 172 F. Supp. 3d 509, 527 (D. Conn. 2016). \nSecond, falling back on its own assumptions about legislative intent, the \nBoard argues that this particular type of sex discrimination falls outside of Title IX \nbecause the legislators who passed the statute were principally focused on ending \ndiscrimination against women. See Def.’s Supp. Br. 28. The Supreme Court \nrejected that approach to statutory interpretation long ago. As Justice Scalia \nexplained on behalf of a unanimous Court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., \nInc.: “[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover \nreasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather \n8 \n   \n\nthan the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.” 523 U.S. \n75, 79 (1998).  \nHere, too, the legislators who passed Title IX may have been principally \nmotivated to end discrimination against women, but they wrote a statute that \n“broadly prohibits a funding recipient from subjecting any person to \n‘discrimination’ ‘on the basis of sex.’” Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 \nU.S. 167, 173 (2005) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)). “‘Discrimination’ is a term \nthat covers a wide range of intentional unequal treatment; by using such a broad \nterm, Congress gave the statute a broad reach.” Id. at 175. Sex-based \ndiscrimination that harms transgender individuals is a “reasonably comparable \nevil” that falls squarely within the statute’s plain text, Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79, and \nthe courts must give the statute “a sweep as broad as its language,” N. Haven, 456 \nU.S. at 521. \nThe plain meaning of “discrimination” “on the basis of sex” cannot be \nnarrowed to reach only the particular forms of sex discrimination recognized by \nCongress in 1972. The Supreme Court has repeatedly warned “that a statute is not \nto be confined to the particular applications contemplated by the legislators.” \nDiamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 315 (1980) (internal quotation marks \nomitted; alterations incorporated). “[C]hanges, in law or in the world,” may often \n“require [a statute’s] application to new instances,” West v. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212, \n9 \n   \n\n218 (1999), and a broadly written statute “embraces all such persons or things as \nsubsequently fall within its scope,” De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1, 217 (1901); cf. \nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 532 (2007) (Clean Air Act covers carbon \ndioxide emissions even though legislators “might not have appreciated the \npossibility that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming”). “If Congress \nhas made a choice of language which fairly brings a given situation within a \nstatute, it is unimportant that the particular application may not have been \ncontemplated by the legislators.” Barr v. United States, 324 U.S. 83, 90 (1945). \nThe same principles apply to Title IX. The statute protects students from \nsexual harassment even though, when Congress enacted the statute, “the concept of \n‘sexual harassment’ as gender discrimination had not been recognized or \nconsidered by the courts.” Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 664 \n(1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The statute also extends to harassment between \nmembers of the same sex even though many judges have stated they “cannot \nbelieve that Congress … could have intended it to reach such situations.” \nMcWilliams v. Fairfax Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 72 F.3d 1191, 1196 (4th Cir. 1996), \nabrogated by Oncale, 523 U.S. 75. “It is not for [the courts] to rewrite the statute \n10 \n   \n\nso that it covers only what [they] think is necessary to achieve what [they] think \nCongress really intended.” Lewis v. City of Chicago, 560 U.S. 205, 215 (2010).8 \nIn the years since Title IX was enacted, the plain meaning of the text has not \nchanged, but our understanding of transgender people has grown. While \ntransgender students have long been part of school communities, it is only in the \nlast couple of decades that there has been more widespread access to the medical \nand psychological support that they need. See AAP Amicus Br. 6. Just as our \nincreased understanding of the ‘[t]he real social impact of workplace behavior,” \nOncale, 523 U.S. at 81-82, prompted courts to recognize that sexual harassment is \na form of discrimination on the basis of sex, our increased understanding of people \nwho are transgender makes clear that discrimination based on transgender status is \na form of sex discrimination that violates Title IX’s plain terms. Cf. Kitchen v. \nHerbert, 961 F. Supp. 2d 1181, 1203 (D. Utah 2013), aff’d, 755 F.3d 1193 (10th \nCir. 2014) (“Here, it is not the Constitution that has changed, but the knowledge of \nwhat it means to be gay or lesbian.”). \nFinally, in a last-ditch effort, the Board contends that sex discrimination \nagainst transgender people is implicitly excluded from Title IX because Congress \npassed unrelated statutes in 2009 and 2013 that explicitly protect individuals based \n                                                        \n8 See also Wrightson v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 99 F.3d 138, 144 (4th Cir. \n1996) (“[W]here Congress has unmistakably provided a cause of action, as it has \nthrough the plain language of Title VII, we are without authority in the guise of \ninterpretation to deny that such exists, whatever the practical consequences.”). \n11 \n   \n\non “gender identity.” See Def.’s. Supp. Br. 29-30 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2) and \n42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A)). This “[p]ost-enactment legislative history (a \ncontradiction in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation.” \nBruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. 223, 242 (2011). Congress’s use of the term \n“gender identity” in 2009 and 2013 says little about the meaning of a statute \nadopted by Congress in 1972. “When a later statute is offered as an expression of \nhow the Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Congress a half century \nbefore, such interpretation has very little, if any, significance.” Bilski v. Kappos, \n561 U.S. 593, 645 (2010) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). \nFailed proposals to add the term “gender identity” to Title IX are even less \nprobative. See United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 287 (2002). “A bill can be \nproposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many \nothers.” Solid Waste Agency v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 U.S. 159, 170 \n(2001); cf. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 529-30 (“That subsequent Congresses have \neschewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us \nnothing about what Congress meant . . . in 1970 and 1977.”). By 2010, when \nCongress first considered the Student Non-Discrimination Act, H.R. 4530, 111th \nCong. (2010), which included express protection for “gender identity,” lower \ncourts had already held that transgender individuals are protected by existing \nstatutes prohibiting sex discrimination. See Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317-\n12 \n   \n\n19 (11th Cir. 2011) (collecting cases). In this context, “another reasonable \ninterpretation of that legislative non-history is that some Members of Congress \nbelieve that . . . the statute requires, not amendment, but only correct \ninterpretation.” Schroer v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 308 (D.D.C. 2008); see \nalso Whitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *10.  \nB.  Neither Title IX nor 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 authorizes the Board to \ndiscriminate against boys and girls who are transgender. \nTitle IX and 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 allow schools to provide sex-separated \nrestroom facilities based on the premise that such facilities do not disadvantage or \nstigmatize any student. The Board now seeks not only to provide separate \nrestrooms for boys and girls, but to use discriminatory criteria designed solely to \nexclude boys and girls who are transgender. See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 27-28, 35-40. The \nBoard’s discriminatory policy is based on “sex,” but neither Title IX nor 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 authorizes the Board to enact whatever sex-based restroom policy it \nchooses—no matter how discriminatory or harmful. When a school provides \nseparate restrooms on the basis of sex pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, it must do so \nin a manner that complies with the statute’s unambiguous prohibition on \ndiscrimination. Pl.’s Supp. Br. 33-37. \nAlthough the Board attempts to draw support from Virginia, 518 U.S. at 550 \nn.19 (see Def.’s Supp. Br. 32-33), the case only undermines its argument. The \nparties in Virginia agreed that including women in the Virginia Military Institute \n13 \n   \n\nwould require adjustments such as “locked doors and coverings on windows.” Id. \nat 588. The Court nevertheless concluded that these minor changes to provide \n“privacy from the other sex” would not disrupt the essential nature of the program \nand could not justify excluding women from admission. Id. at 550 n.19. The \nteaching of the case is not that privacy concerns justify discrimination. It is that \nprivacy interests, where actually implicated, must be accommodated in a manner \nthat does not exclude individuals from equal educational opportunity. See id. at \n555 n.20.  \nSimilarly, this Court’s decision in Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340 (4th Cir. \n2016), provides no support for the Board’s argument that Title IX allows schools \nto discriminate based on physiological characteristics. In that case, this Court held \nthat employers may use gender-normed physical-fitness standards without \nviolating Title VII because “the physiological differences between men and \nwomen impact their relative abilities to demonstrate the same levels of physical \nfitness.” Id. at 351 (emphasis added). The gender-normed standards were designed \nto treat employees equally by measuring the same levels of physical fitness for \neveryone. Cf. Cal. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 289 (1987) \n(California law taking into account physical differences resulting from pregnancy \ntreats employees equally because it “allows women, as well as men, to have \nfamilies without losing their jobs”). Nothing in Bauer supports the notion that \n14 \n   \n\nschools or employers can use physical differences as a basis for unequal and \nstigmatizing treatment. 9 \nIt also bears repeating that, no matter how many times the Board invokes \nphysiological differences, the actual policy does not assign restrooms based on \nphysiological characteristics. See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 38-39. It assigns restrooms based \non “biological gender,” which the Board uses as a proxy for physiological \ncharacteristics that may or may not be present in any particular student. See \nAmicus Br. of interACT, et al., ECF 138-1; Whitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *13. \nThe reality is that boys and girls who are transgender and who have received \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy have physiological and anatomical \ncharacteristics—including breasts in girls who are transgender, facial and body hair \nin boys who are transgender, muscle and bone structure, and the appearance of a \nperson’s genitals—that do not typically align with the sex designated for them at \nbirth. See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 38-39.  \nMoreover, even if the Board’s policy were actually based on physiological \ncharacteristics, those differences are not relevant to restroom use. The Board’s \n                                                        \n9 The National College Athletic Association’s policy (Def.’s Supp. Br. 41 \nn.14) demonstrates that physiological differences between boys and girls who are \ntransgender and other boys and girls—where those differences are actually \nrelevant—can be addressed without categorically excluding transgender students \nfrom sports teams. See also Dep’t of Justice and Dep’t of Educ., “Dear Colleague” \nLetter at 3 & nn.14-15 (May. 13, 2016), https://goo.gl/p4z3Ch. \n15 \n   \n\nasserted interest in avoiding exposure to nudity is not implicated by Gavin’s use—\nor any other person’s use—of the restrooms, especially in light of the additional \nprivacy protections the Board has already installed. See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 38-39. A \nboy who is transgender (and who may be indistinguishable from any other boy) \nwill be far more disruptive to expectations of privacy if he is forced to use the \ngirls’ restrooms than if he uses the same restrooms as other boys. See Whitaker, \n2017 WL 2331751, at *15. Any purported discomfort with Gavin’s use of the \nrestroom at Gloucester High School would be based on other people’s social \nknowledge that he is transgender, not any actual exposure to private anatomy.10  \nC.  The Board mischaracterizes Gavin’s claims as based solely on \n“internal perception” of gender identity. \nThe Board ignores the substance of Gavin’s actual legal claims and asserts \nthat Gavin’s treatment documentation letter, hormone therapy, name change, \nsurgery, State I.D. card, and amended birth certificate are “irrelevant” because \nGavin seeks access to the restroom based solely on his “internal perception of a \nmale gender identity.” Def.’s Supp. Br. 21 n.7.  \n                                                        \n10 Even in the context of locker rooms, the actual experience of school \ndistricts across the country reflects that transgender students and non-transgender \nstudents already use the same locker rooms without seeing “intimate part[s]” of \none another’s bodies. Students & Parents for Privacy v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. \n16-CV-4945, 2016 WL 6134121, at *28-29 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2016) (report and \nrecommendation); see Sch. Admin. Amicus Br. 18-19; NY Amicus Br. 21-25; \nStudent Amicus Br. 10-19; Pl.’s Supp. Br. 45 n.32. \n16 \n   \n\nThat is obviously not true. Gavin has brought an as-applied challenge \nalleging that because he has transitioned and lives his entire life as the boy that he \nis, excluding him from using the same restrooms as other boys discriminates \nagainst him on the basis of sex. JA 20-22. The undisputed facts of Gavin’s \ntransition are extremely relevant to that challenge. Cf. Whitaker, 2017 WL \n2331751, at *2-3; Evancho v. Pine-Richland Sch. Dist., No. CV 2:16-01537, 2017 \nWL 770619, at *2-5 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 27, 2017). Although a person’s gender identity \nis internal, Gavin’s gender transition is external, verifiable, and extensively \ndocumented. Cf. Whitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *11 (“This is not a case where a \nstudent has merely announced that he is a different gender.”). \nThe Board’s mischaracterization of Gavin’s claims reflects the Board’s \nmischaracterization of what it means to be a boy or girl who is transgender. \nStudents do not become transgender by virtue of declaring at different points in \ntime that they perceive themselves to be male or female. Boys and girls who are \ntransgender are people who “consistently, persistently, and insistently” do not \nidentify with the sex assigned to them at birth and who experience the debilitating \ndistress of gender dysphoria when they are not able to live as the boys and girls \n17 \n   \n\nthat they are. AAP Amicus Br. 8-11. The gender identity of these adolescents is \nstable and fixed. Id.; see also Sch. Admin. Amicus Br. 19-21.11  \nThere is no dispute that Gavin is a boy who is transgender. If a person’s \ntransgender status is ever legitimately in doubt, the Board can easily ask for \nexternal verification from a medical provider or a parent. See Pl.’s. Supp. Br. 42-\n43. Gavin has no objection to providing a treatment documentation letter; he \nalready presented one to school administrators before his sophomore year began.  \nD.  Gavin’s claims do not implicate Pennhurst. \nFinally, the Board resorts to Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981), and the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. Def.’s \nSupp. Br. 45-47. If the Court chooses to consider this argument (which the Board \ndid not previously raise in this Court or the district court) it is foreclosed by \nbinding precedent.  \n                                                        \n11 Some of the Board’s amici reject this medical consensus and rely upon the \nfringe views of Dr. Paul McHugh and an organization that calls itself the American \nCollege of Pediatricians. See Amicus Br. of McHugh, et al., ECF 210. Those views \nfall far outside the mainstream medical community. See AAP Amicus Br. 17-18. \nDr. McHugh and the American College of Pediatricians have a history of making \nsimilar fringe arguments regarding sexual orientation. See Amicus Br. of Liberty \nCounsel & Am. Coll. of Pediatricians, Bostic v. Schaeffer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. \n2014) (No. 14-1167), 2014 WL 1333847, at *10 (rejecting medical consensus and \nadvancing fringe arguments regarding “the inherent harms of living a homosexual \nlifestyle”); Amicus Br. of McHugh, Bostic v. Schaeffer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. \n2014) (No. 14-1167), 2014 WL 1333850, at *13 (comparing homosexuality to \npolyamory and zoophilia and arguing that “there is serious doubt whether sexual \norientation is a valid concept at all”). \n18 \n   \n\nFirst, Pennhurst provides no defense to Gavin’s claim for injunctive relief. \nIn applying Pennhurst, the “central concern . . . is with ensuring that the receiving \nentity of federal funds has notice that it will be liable for a monetary award.” \nGebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 287 (1998) (internal \nquotation marks and brackets omitted). Pennhurst thus affects only the available \nremedy for violations of Title IX, not “the scope of the behavior Title IX \nproscribes.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 639; see Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284 (distinguishing \nbetween “the scope of the implied right” and “the scope of the available \nremedies”). “[A] court may identify the violation and enjoin its continuance or \norder recipients of federal funds prospectively to perform their duties incident to \nthe receipt of federal money,” and then “the recipient has the option of \nwithdrawing and hence terminating the prospective force of the injunction.” \nGuardians Ass’n v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of City of N.Y., 463 U.S. 582, 596 (1983) \n(White, J.); see Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 (applying Justice White’s Guardians \nopinion to Title IX).12  \nSecond, even with respect to damages, the Supreme Court has—in an \nunbroken line of cases—applied Pennhurst to Title IX by restricting liability for \ndamages to acts of intentional discrimination, as opposed to negligence or \n                                                        \n12 See also Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 \n(2006) (applying Pennhurst in determining recipients’ financial liability for costs \nunder the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act). \n19 \n   \n\nvicarious liability. It has never applied Pennhurst to Title IX by restricting the \nscope of the statutory text. See Jackson, 544 U.S. at 182-83; Davis, 526 U.S. at \n639; Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287; Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, \n74-75 (1992). As the Court has reaffirmed multiple times: “The Pennhurst notice \nproblem does not arise in a case . . . in which intentional discrimination is alleged.” \nJackson, 544 U.S. at 182-83 (alterations incorporated). Because the discrimination \nhere is indisputably intentional and violates the statute’s plain terms, Pennhurst \nposes no barrier.  \nIn arguing that Title IX must explicitly refer to discrimination against \ntransgender students, the Board and its amici repeat the same argument that this \nCourt rejected in West Virginia Department of Health & Human Resources v. \nSebelius, 649 F.3d 217, 223 (4th Cir. 2011). In that case, this Court held that West \nVirginia’s “‘super-clear statement’ rule . . . misreads Pennhurst and its progeny.” \nId. Pennhurst does not require Congress to “prospectively resolve every possible \nambiguity concerning particular applications” of a statute. Id. at 224 (quoting \nBennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985)).  \nThat is particularly true in the context of Title IX, which has an implied \ncause of action and does “not list any specific discriminatory practices” that are \nprohibited. Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175. “[A] State that accepts funds under [a statute \nwith an implied cause of action] does so with the knowledge that the rules for . . . \n20 \n   \n\nliability will be subject to judicial determination.” Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 \nF.3d 261, 285 (2d Cir. 2003). Thus, “funding recipients have been on notice that \nthey could be subjected to private suits for intentional sex discrimination under \nTitle IX since 1979, when [the Supreme Court] decided Cannon[ v. University of \nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 691 (1979)],” and “have been put on notice by the fact that \n[Supreme Court] cases since Cannon . . . have consistently interpreted Title IX’s \nprivate cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex \ndiscrimination.” Jackson, 544 U.S. at 182. A recipient who accepts federal funding \ndoes so with the knowledge that disagreements over whether a particular practice \nconstitutes “discrimination” “on the basis of sex” will be resolved by the courts in \naccordance with these precedents.13 \nThe Board’s reliance on Pennhurst also fails for an additional reason: \nCongress’s powers under the Fourteenth Amendment provide independent \n                                                        \n13 Instead of relying on decisions interpreting Title IX, an amicus brief from \nWest Virginia (see Amicus Br. of W. Va., et al, ECF 141, at 11) relies on this \nCourt’s decision interpreting the IDEA in Virginia Department of Education v. \nRiley, 106 F.3d 559, 563 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc), superseded by IDEA \nAmendments for 1997, Pub. L. No. 105–17, § 612. The question in Riley was \nwhether the obligation to provide students with disabilities “a free appropriate \npublic education” implicitly required Virginia to provide private tutors to students \nwho are expelled for serious misconduct unrelated to their disability. See 106 F.3d \nat 562 The dispute was not about the meaning of particular statutory terms, such as \n“handicap” or “free appropriate public education.” It was about whether an entirely \nnew condition completely unrelated to a student’s disability could be implied. \nEven without resorting to Pennhurst, this Court held that such a requirement had \nno basis in the statutory text. See id. at 563. \n \n21 \n   \n\nauthority to enforce Title IX, and those powers are not subject to Pennhurst’s \nlimitations. See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 n.8 (reserving this argument); Litman v. \nGeorge Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544, 557 (4th Cir. 1999) (same); see also Escue v. \nN. Okla. Coll., 450 F.3d 1146, 1152 (10th Cir. 2006); Franks v. Ky. Sch. for the \nDeaf, 142 F.3d 360, 362 (6th Cir. 1998); Crawford v. Davis, 109 F.3d 1281 (8th \nCir. 1997).14  \n                                                        \n14 West Virginia attempts to interject an additional issue into the case by \narguing that applying Title IX to discrimination against students who are \ntransgender is unconstitutionally coercive under National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses (“NFIB”) v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2605 (2012). See \nWV Amicus Br. 23-27. It would be inappropriate for the Court to address an \nargument raised for the first time on appeal and raised only by amici.  \nAmici’s argument also fails on the merits. First, the statute in NFIB was \nunconstitutionally coercive because it threatened to terminate funds for States’ \nexisting Medicaid program unless the States agree to participate in what amounted \nto an entirely “new program.” 132 S. Ct. at 2605 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). Even if \nan unforeseen application of Title IX could be analogized to an alteration of the \nstatute, it would not amount to the establishment of an entirely “new program” \nunder NFIB. Rather, it would be analogous to the type of Medicaid amendments \ncited approvingly in NFIB, which “merely altered and expanded the boundaries” of \nthe discrete categories States were required to cover. Id. at 2606. \nSecond, the coercion analysis in NFIB was limited to contexts in which \nCongress uses the Spending Clause to dragoon States into implementing a federal \nprogram. It does not apply to statutes such as Title IX, which merely seek “to avoid \nthe use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices.” Cannon, 441 U.S. \nat 704. See NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2603-04 (distinguishing between requiring States to \nimplement federal programs and imposing conditions on the use of federal funds). \nThird, the amount of funding at issue in Title IX is far less than the amount \nof Medicaid funding at issue in NFIB. The joint dissent specifically noted that \nMedicaid funding “is at least twice the size of federal education funding as a \npercentage of state expenditures.” Id. at 2664 (joint dissent). \nFourth, amici’s argument rests on the mistaken premise that they risk losing \nall of their educational funding. To the contrary, Title IX’s “pinpoint” provision \n22 \n   \n\nIII.  Gavin’s Motion For A Preliminary Injunction Should Be Granted.  \nA.  Gavin has established a likelihood of success under both Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause.  \nFor the same reasons that Gavin has stated a claim under Title IX, he has \nalso established a likelihood of success. But, even if Title IX did not protect Gavin, \nhe would still be entitled to a preliminary injunction under the Equal Protection \nClause. The Court should address Gavin’s likelihood of success on both claims, \nand hold that Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause provide independent bases \nfor issuing a preliminary injunction. See Whitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *8-14. A \nruling based only on Title IX could subject Gavin to more petitions for certiorari \nand remands to separately address each alternative basis for issuing a preliminary \ninjunction. The Court should avoid further unnecessary delay and address both \nclaims now. \nTo the extent that the Board discusses equal protection at all, it relies on \nTuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001), for the proposition that different \ntreatment based on biological differences is not the type of “gender-based \nstereotype” that constitutes sex discrimination. Def.’s Supp. Br. 33. In Nguyen, the \nSupreme Court upheld a statute that provided different procedures for unmarried \nmothers and unmarried fathers to transmit U.S. citizenship to their children. The \n                                                                                                                                                                                   \nlimits termination of funding “to the particular program, or part thereof” where \n“noncompliance [is]…found.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682; see Dep’t of Justice, Title IX \nLegal Manual § VII.C.2 (2005), https://goo.gl/2TkL1t.  \n23 \n   \n\nCourt held that this distinction was permissible because “[t]he difference between \nmen and women in relation to the birth process” meant that mothers, by virtue of \nhaving given birth, automatically had a biological connection to the child and an \nopportunity to form a meaningful relationship. 533 U.S. at 73. But the Court’s \nanalysis did not begin and end with biology. The Court emphasized that the policy \nwas tailored so that it imposed only a “minimal” burden that could be easily met \nwith a written acknowledgement of paternity under oath. Id. at 70. The Court also \nemphasized that the statute was not “marked by misconception and prejudice” or \n“disrespect.” Id. at 73. \nThe Board’s policy bears no resemblance to the tailored statute that survived \nheightened scrutiny in Nguyen. It is a categorical exclusion. It lacks any rational \nconnection to the Board’s stated interests in protecting privacy related to nudity. It \ninflicts physical and psychological harm. It is “marked by misconception,” id. at \n73, and it stigmatizes boys and girls who are transgender as unfit to use the same \nrestrooms as their peers. Indeed, the policy rests on a fear of “people who appear to \nbe different in some respects from ourselves” that cannot justify discrimination \nunder any standard of scrutiny. Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. \n356, 374 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n24 \n   \n\nB.  Gavin has satisfied the remaining preliminary injunction \nrequirements. \nAlthough the Board does not explicitly address the requirements for a \npreliminary injunction, it suggests that any harms inflicted on Gavin are \noutweighed by the hypothetical harms that would be inflicted on other students if \nGavin uses the boys’ restrooms. Def.’s Supp. Br. 43. But according to the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and other medical organizations, “there is no \nevidence of any harm to the physical or mental health of other children and \nadolescents when transgender students use facilities that match their gender \nidentity.” AAP Amicus Br. 19-20. There is also no evidence that Gavin’s use of the \nrestrooms is a safety threat to himself or others. See G.G. v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. \nBd., 822 F.3d 709, 723 n.11 (4th Cir. 2016). And Gavin’s use of the restrooms \ndoes not implicate any privacy interests related to nudity. See id. at 723 n.10; \nWhitaker, 2017 WL 2331751, at *12-13.  \nMoreover, all students are free to use one of the single-stall restrooms if they \nare uncomfortable with Gavin’s presence, or the presence of anyone else, in the \ncommon restroom. “For other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no \nstigma whatsoever, whereas for [Gavin] using those same restrooms is tantamount \nto humiliation and a continuing mark of difference among his fellow students.” \nG.G., 822 F.3d at 729 (Davis, J., concurring).  \n25 \n   \n\nThe Board argues that hypothetical classmates should not have to use the \nsingle-stall restrooms in order to protect “their own adolescent modesty, personal \nsensitivities, or religious scruples.” Def.’s Supp. Br. 43. As the NAACP Legal \nDefense Fund points out, the same arguments have been used to exclude black \npeople, gay people, and people with disabilities from swimming pools, restrooms, \nand other common spaces. See Amicus Br. of NAACP LDF, ECF 146-1. Schools \ncan provide options for students to enhance their own privacy (however broadly \ndefined), but they cannot force transgender students to use separate facilities to \naccommodate other students’ purported privacy or discomfort. Cf. Obergefell v. \nHodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602 (2015) (“sincere, personal opposition” of some \npeople cannot justify policy that “demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty \nis then denied”). \n26 \n   \n\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse the dismissal of \nPlaintiff’s Title IX claim and reverse the denial of a preliminary injunction based \non both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION   AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION  \nOF VIRGINIA FOUNDATION, INC.

On December 9, 2014, the Gloucester County Public School\nFOUNDATION OF\nVIRGINIA Board (the “School Board”) adopted a policy stating that the use ofboys’ and girls’\n701 E. FRANKLIN ST.\nrestroom and locker rooms “shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and\nSUITE 1412\nRICHMOND, VA23219 students with sincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private\nT1804.644.8080\nfacility.” Gavin, who is a tenth-grade student at Gloucester High School and a\nWWW.ACLUVA.ORG\ntransgender boy, had been using the boys’ restroom facilities at school without any\ncomplaints from peers, prior to the adoption ofthis policy. GCPS adopted its “biological\nLESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL gender” policy in direct response to Gavin in order to prevent him from continuing to use\nTRANSGENDER AND\nAIDS PROJECT boys’ facilities. The “biological gender” policy on its face and as applied to Gavin\nAMERICAN CIVIL discriminates against Gavin on the basis ofhis sex in violation ofTitle DC ofthe\nLIBERTIES UNION\nFOUNDATION Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (“Title IX”).\n125 BROAD ST., 18TH FL.\nNEW YORK, NY 10004\nT/212.549.2600 Ifthe Educational Opportunities Section declines to pursue this complaint, we\nWWW.ACLU.ORG/LGBT respectfully request that this complaint be referred to the Department of Education,\nOffice ofCivil Rights.\nI. Contact Information for the Parties\nGavin Grimm and his mother, Deirdre Grimm, may be contacted through undersigned\ncounsel.\nThis complaint is against Gloucester County Public Schools, 6099 T.C. Walker Road,\nGloucester, VA 23061. It is represented by Edwin Wilmot, County Attorney.\nII. Facts\nGavin is a sophomore at Gloucester High School. He is also a transgender boy\nwith a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Consistent with recognized standards of\ncare for teens with gender dysphoria, Gavin’s medical and mental health\nproviders have determined that living in accordance with his gender identity in\nevery possible respect, including using the appropriate restroom, is essential for\nhis treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nEducational Opportunities Section\nU.S. Department ofJustice Civil Rights Division\nPage 2 of6\nSince the beginning ofthis school year, Gavin has been open about his gender\nidentity with Gloucester High School’s administration, teachers, and students. At\nfirst, Gavin exclusively used unisex restroom facilities in the nurse’s office, but\nfound that experience to be stigmatizing and isolating. Beginning on\napproximately October 20, 2014, Gavin has been allowed to use the boys’\nrestrooms on campus. Gavin’s use ofthe restroom appropriate to his gender\nidentity has caused no disruption ofany kind at the school during the ensuing\nmonth. To our knowledge, not a single student complained to school officials or\nexpressed discomfort with Gavin using the boys’ restrooms on campus.\nIn response to complaints from parents, GCPS adopted the following policy at a\nSchool Board meeting on December 9, 2014:\nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender\nidentities, and\nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support and advice\nfrom parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and\nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all\nstudents and to protect the privacy ofall students, therefore\nIt shall be the practice ofthe GCPS to provide male and female restroom\nand locker room facilities in its schools, and the use ofsaid facilities shall\nbe limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with\nsincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private\nfacility.\nAccording to news reports, at least one student at Gloucester High School, a freshman\nboy who is not transgender, said that some students are uncomfortable using the same\nrestroom as a transgender boy but did not report any concerns to the administration for\nfear ofbeing labeled as bullies or intolerant.1 Some parents expressed concern that\n“transgender students would be looking at other people’s private parts, especially in\nboys’ bathrooms.”2 During the School Board meeting, Gavin was referred to by some\nspeakers as “a girl” and as “a freak.”3\nThe School Board adopted the policy by a vote of 6-1, despite the objections ofthe\ndissenting school board member that the proposed policy violated Title IX and exposed\nGCPS to the risk oflosing federal funding.\nAccording to news reports, GCPS stated in a news release that it plans to increase privacy\nin restrooms by “adding or expanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, and\n‘Frances Hubbard, GloucesterSchoolBoardOKspolicy restricting transgenderstudentsfrom using boys’\nrestroom, The DailyPress, Dec. 9, 2014, http://www.dailypress.comlnews/gloucester-countv/dp-nws-mid\ntransgender-policy-decision-20141209-storv.html.\n2Dominic Holden, Virginia SchoolBoardBans TransStudents from UsingRestrooms BasedOn Gender\nIdentity, Buzfeed, Dec. 10, 2014, http://www.huzzfeed.comldominicholden/virginia-school-hoard-bans\ntrans-students-from-bathrooms-of.\n3BarbaraI.

Beginning on December 10, 2014, school officials have prevented\nGavin from using the boys’ restroom and required him to travel to a unisex restroom in\nthe nurse’s office instead. As a result, Gavin is once again stigmatized and isolated from\nhis peers whenever he has to use the restroom. The additional unisex restrooms\nmentioned in the GCPS news release have not yet been installed. Gavin has a history of\ndepression and anxiety, which have been exacerbated by the new policy. Even ifmore\nunisex bathrooms were installed in convenient locations at school, Gavin finds the\nrestroom exclusion, which singles out transgender students by requiring them to use\nseparate facilities, to be inherently stigmatizing and demeaning.\nIII. Legal Discussion\nThe “biological gender” restroompolicy adopted by GCPS violates the rights ofGavin\nand other transgender students under Title IX, which provides that no student “on the\nbasis of sex may “be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal\nfinancial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 16$1(a).\nFederal courts have made clear that the protections in Title IX from discrimination based\non “sex” include discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status. See, e.g.,\nPratt v. Indian River Cent.Sch.Dist., $03 F. Supp. 2d 135, 150-52 (N.D.N.Y. 201 1); Doe\nv. Brimfield Grade Sch., 552 F. Supp. 2d 816, 823 (C.D. 111. 2008); Montgomery v.\nIndependentSch. Dist. No. 709, 109 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1090 (D. Minn. 2000); cf Glenn\nv. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011). The Department ofJustice and the\nDepartment ofEducation have similarly made clear that “Title IX’s sex discrimination\nprohibition extends to claims ofdiscrimination based on gender identity.”4 Indeed,\ndiscrimination based on a person’s transgender status isper se discrimination based on\nthat person’s “sex.” Macy v. Holder, Appeal No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995, at *8\n(E.E.O.C. Apr. 20, 2012).\nCourts and administrative tribunals have held that preventing a transgender person from\nusing the restroom in accordance with that person’s gender identity may constitute\n4Dep’tofEduc., Office ofCivil Rights, Questions &Answers on Title IX & Sexual Violence, at 5 (Apr. 29,\n2014), http://www2.ed.gov/abouUoftlces/Iist/ocr/docs/ga-201404-title-ix.pclf.Seealso Letter ofResolution,\nArcadiaUnified School District, DOJ Case No. DI 169-12C-70, OCR Case No. 09-12-10120, at 2 (July 24,\n2013) (“All students, including transgender students and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes,\nare protected from sex-based discrimination underTitle IX.”).

Lew, 973 F.Supp.2d 561(D. Md. 2013)\n(evidence ofsex discrimination under Title VII included allegation that “supervisors\nrepeatedly denied her access to the women’s restroom, and in doing so referred to her\n‘male genitalia”); Mathis v. Fountain Fort Carson Sch. Dist. 8, No. P20130034X (Cob.\nDiv. ofCivil Rights June 17, 2013) available online at\nhttp://www.transgender1egal.org/media1up1oads/doc_529.pdf(treating transgender girl\ndifferently than other girls by excluding her from using girls’ restroom violates Colorado\nlaw against sex discrimination in education). The Department ofJustice and the\nDepartment ofEducation have also entered into binding settlement agreements requiring\nschool districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms and other sex-segregated\nfacilities that correspond to their gender identity instead ofunisex restrooms.5\nThe “biological gender” policy at GCPS singles out transgender students for disparate\ntreatment based on their transgender status. Every otherboy is free to choose whether to\nuse the boys’ restroom or a unisex restroom. Every other girl is free to choose whether to\nuse the girls’ restroom or a unisex restroom. But transgender students and only\n—\ntransgender students are banned from using the same restrooms as their peers and\n—\ninstead are limited to separate unisex facilities.\nAs a practical matter, the “biological gender” policy at GCPS significantly interferes with\nthe ability ofGavin and other transgender students to fully participate in daily school\nactivities because it singles out transgender students for different treatment and forces\nthem to travel to separate facilities which are often further away and inconveniently\n—\nlocated whenever they have to use the restroom. As the Colorado Civil Rights Division\n—\nexplained in a decision finding that such restrictions constitute sex discrimination:\nThe evidence suggests that the restroom restriction also created an\nexclusionary environment, which tended to ostracize the [Student], in\neffect producing an environment in which the [Student] was forced to\ndisengage from her group offriends. An additional problematic issue\n. . .\nwith this solution is the possibility that the [Student] may be in an area\nwhere she does not have easy access to approved restrooms. As a result.\nthe [Student] is tasked with the burden ofhaving to plan her restroom\nvisits to ensure that she has sufficient time to get to one ofthe approved\nrestrooms.\nMathis, No. P20130034X at 1 1l2.6\nGCPS has stated that it intends to install more convenient unisex restroom facilities at\nsome point in the future but even more conveniently located unisex restrooms would not\n5Resolution Agreement, Downey Unified School District, OCR Case No. 09-12-1095, at 1 (Nov. 8, 2014),\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/downey-school-district-agreement.pdf(requiring that\ntransgender studentbe allowed to use the sex-segregatedfacilities consistent with student’s gender\nidentity); Resolution Agreement,Arcadia Unified School District, DOJ Case No. DI 169-12C-70, OCR\nCase No. 09-12-10120, at 2 (July 24, 2013), http://www.nc1righls.org/wp\ncontenUup1oads/2013/09/Arcadia_Resolution agreement 07.24.2013.pdf(same)\n6Available online at http://www.transgender1eaLorg/mediaJuploads/doc 529.pdf\n\nEducational Opportunities Section\nU.S. Department ofJustice Civil Rights Division\nPage 5 of6\nchange the stigmatizing and harmful effects ofits policy. Indeed, the stigmatizing policy\nbreeds or fosters gender-stereotype-based hostility toward Gavin from his peers, which\nGCPS has an obligation to protect him from instead ofencouraging. See Pratt, 803 F.\nSupp. 2d at 151-52. Forcing Gavin to use a separate bathroom from his peers “overtly\ndemonstrate[sJh[is] separateness from the other students” and fosters “an environment\nrife with harassment and inapposite to a nurturing school atmosphere.” Mathis, No.\nP20130034X at 11. The real potential for such harassment is reflected in some ofthe\npublic comments at the School Board meeting labeling Gavin as a “girl” and a “freak.”\nThe GCPS school board apparently adopted the policy in order to protect the privacy\nrights ofboys who are not transgender and guard against the possibility that transgender\nboys would look at other boys’ “private parts.” Ifany student whether transgender or\n—\nnot violates another student’s privacy in the restroom GCPS can and should take\n—\nappropriate action. But there has not been any complaint that Gavin has engaged in any’\nmisconduct, and stated privacy concerns appear to be nothing more than irrational\nprejudice or stigma against transgender people. Cf Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433\n(1984) (“Private biases may be outside the reach ofthe law, but the law cannot, directly\nor indirectly, give them effect.”). Indeed, when similar concerns were raised about\nstudents sharing restrooms and locker rooms with lesbian, gay, and bisexual peers, those\narguments were rightly rejected. See, e.g., Massey v. Banning Unified Sch. Dist., 256\nF.Supp.2d 1090 (C.D. Cal. 2003). The School Board’s “assertions ofemotional\ndiscomfort about sharing facilities with transgender individuals are no different than\nsimilar claims ofdiscomfort in the presence of [other] minority group[s].” Dep‘t ofFair\nEmployment & Housing vs. Am. Pac. Corp. No. 4-2013-015153-CU-CR-GDS, at 4 (Cal.\nSuper. Ct. Mar. 13, 2014), available online at\nhttp://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/Announcements/Lozano%20final%20order.pdf.\nGCPS can take appropriate measures to respect all students’ privacy, but it cannot do so\nby singling out transgender students for different treatment. The concerns ofany students\nwho do not want to use a communal restroom because the restroom is shared with\n—\ntransgender students or for any other reason can be addressed by the GCPS plans to\n—\ninstall more dividers in boys’ restrooms and to make unisex restrooms available. The\nburden, however, may not be discriminatorily placed on transgender students to use\nseparate restroom facilities to address other students’ alleged discomfort. Cf Cruzan v.\nSpecial Sch. Dist, No. 1, 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. 2002) (noting that non-transgender\nemployee who did not want to use the same restroom as a transgender employee was free\nto use unisex restroom instead); Doe v. Regional Sch. Unit 26, 86 A.3d 600 (Me. 2014)\n(holding that transgender girls could not be banned from using girls’ restroom based on\ncomplaints from other students’ parents).\n\nEducational Opportunities Section\nU.S. Department ofJustice Civil Rights Division\nPage 6 of 6\nIV. Conclusion\nFor all these reasons, as a result ofthe new “biological gender” restroom and locker room\npolicy adopted by GCPS, Gavin has been “excluded from participation in,”denied the\nbenefits of,” and “subjected to discrimination” because ofhis sex in an education\nprogram receiving funding, in violation ofTitle IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).\nRespectfully submitted,\nA\no5 Jo/)\nJoshua A.

Should the petition for a\nwrit  of  certiorari  be  denied,  this  stay  shall  terminate \nautomatically.  In the event the petition for a writ of certi-\norari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the issu-\nance of the judgment of this Court. \nJUSTICE BREYER, concurring.  \n  In light of the facts that four Justices have voted to \ngrant the application referred to the Court by THE CHIEF  \nJUSTICE, that we are currently in  recess, and that grant-\ning a stay will preserve the status quo  (as of the time the \nCourt of Appeals made its decision) until the Court con-\nsiders  the  forthcoming  petition  for  certiorari,  I  vote  to \ngrant the application as a courtesy.  See Medellín v. Texas, \n554 U. S. 759, 765 (2008) (BREYER,  J., dissenting). \nJUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE  \nKAGAN  would deny the application. \n ",

First, G.G. offers noth-\ning to contradict the conclusion by several Justices that \nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), should be reconsid-\nered. Second, G.G.’s attempt to avoid the circuit conflicts \ndescribed in the petition mischaracterizes the decision \nbelow. Third, this case remains an excellent vehicle for \nresolving both the divisions over Auer and—if the Court \nchooses—the proper interpretation of Title IX and its \nimplementing regulation.  \nG.G.’s suggestion that the Court should nevertheless \n“wait and see” how other courts address these issues ig-\nnores the fact that the merits of Auer have already been \nexhaustively  discussed  in  judicial  opinions  and  legal \nscholarship.  More  importantly,  the  suggestion  also  ig-\nnores the enormous costs now being inflicted nationwide \non educational institutions, school boards, and States by \nthe regulatory mischief on vivid display in this case. Just \nas those widespread and irreparable harms justified this \nCourt’s recall and stay of the Fourth Circuit’s mandate, \nthey likewise justify immediate review.  \nI.  AUER’S  VIABILITY  RICHLY  MERITS \nREVIEW,  INDEPENDENT  OF  THE  TITLE \nIX ISSUE. \nG.G. disputes none of the Board’s challenges to Auer. \nThus, G.G. does not dispute that Auer deference to agen-\ncy  regulatory  interpretations  gives  officials  enormous \n(1 ) \n \n\n2  \npower over controversial policies, as dramatically illus-\ntrated by decision below. Nor does G.G. dispute that Au-\ner deference in its current form violates the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act. Nor does G.G. dispute that, contrary \nto separation of powers, Auer empowers an agency to \ninvade the law-making and law-interpreting provinces of \nCongress and the courts. Pet. 18–25.  \n1. Tellingly, G.G. also does not dispute that Auer is \nuntenable after Mead, which substantially cabined Chev-\nron’s application to agency interpretations of the stat-\nutes  they  administer.  See  Pet.  23–25;  see  also  United \nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229–34 (2001) (hold-\ning Chevron applies only when Congress affirmatively \nintends to delegate interpretive or gap-filling authority \nto an agency). And Mead itself is a complete answer to \nG.G’s argument that overruling or limiting Auer would \nrequire “special justification.” Opp. 17. Fundamental in-\ncompatibility with subsequent precedents is justification \nfor overruling or limiting earlier ones. See, e.g., Oberge-\nfell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2598–99 (2015); Lawrence \nv. Texas, 539 U.S. 538, 573–75 (2003).  \n2. G.G. attempts to buttress Auer by citing a forth-\ncoming article by Professors Sunstein and Vermeule. See \nOpp.  17–18  (citing  Cass  R.  Sunstein  &  Adrian  Ver-\nmeule, The Unbearable Rightness of Auer, 83 U. Chi. L. \nRev.  (forthcoming  2016),  available  at  http://ssrn.com/ \nabstract=2716737).  But  G.G.  ignores  two  decades  of \nscholarly criticism of Auer. See Brief of Cato Institute at \n5–8 (detailing academic criticism of Auer). In any event, \nSunstein and Vermeule do not explain how Auer com-\nports with Mead. Nor do they explain how extending \n \n \n\n3  \nAuer  to  informal  agency  letters  honors  the  APA  re-\nquirement that “substantive” agency rules undergo no-\ntice and comment. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3). Nor do they \naddress the most fundamental objection to applying Au-\ner here: If the Ferg-Cadima interpretation binds the fed-\neral courts and Title IX recipients, then why is it not a \n“substantive” rule that must undergo notice and com-\nment? See Pet. 24–25; see also Texas v. United States, \nNo. 7:16-cv-00054 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016) (App. 212a–\n217a) (holding May 13, 2016 “Dear Colleague” letter is a \nsubstantive rule triggering notice and comment). \nOnce  agency  pronouncements  such  as  the  Ferg-\nCadima letter receive the Auer mantle, they carry the \nforce of law—as illustrated by the fact that, if the deci-\nsion below stands, any school in the Fourth Circuit that \ndeparts from the letter’s “guidance” will be sued, face \nthe loss of federal educational funds, or both. The pro-\npriety of that state of affairs—which is “a basic [issue] \ngoing to the heart of administrative law,” Decker v. Nw. \nEnvtl. Def. Ctr., 133 S. Ct. 1326, 1339 (2013) (Roberts, \nC.J., concurring)—is squarely posed by this case and \nshould be taken up by the Court.  \nII.  AMONG  OTHER  ISSUES,  THE  CIRCUITS \nARE  DIVIDED  OVER  THE  PROPER \nAPPLICATION  OF  AUER  TO  INFORMAL \nAGENCY OPINION LETTERS. \nG.G. is also mistaken in challenging the circuit divi-\nsions explained in the petition (at 25–29), and in suggest-\ning that, regardless, this case “does not implicate” them. \nOpp. 18. \n \n \n\n4  \n1.  Taking  the  second  point  first:  G.G.’s  argument \nthat the divisions outlined in the petition are not “impli-\ncated by this case” (Opp. 18) attempts to rewrite the \nFourth Circuit’s decision. G.G. is of course correct that \nthe Department of Education (Department) asserted its \nposition in this case, not just in the Ferg-Cadima letter, \nbut also in a statement of interest and amicus brief. Id. \nBut that is irrelevant: The only document to which the \nFourth Circuit actually deferred was the Ferg-Cadima \nletter. See App. 18a (noting United States requested def-\nerence to “OCR’s January 7, 2015 letter”); see also id. \n41a (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (noting “the majority re-\nlies entirely on [the] 2015 letter”). Thus, Fourth Circuit \nlaw now requires courts to defer to informal agency let-\nters  regardless  of  whether  they  are  accompanied  by \nstatements of interest or amicus briefs.  \n2.  G.G. also argues that the 4-3 circuit split on defer-\nence to informal agency pronouncements like the Ferg-\nCadima letter is “questionable.” Opp. 18. It is not.  \nFor example, while United States v. Lachman, 387 \nF.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004), concerned informal statements \nat  industry  seminars  rather  than  in  an  opinion  letter \n(Opp. 19), the reasons the First Circuit gave for refusing \nto defer in that setting plainly apply here. The court ex-\nplained that Mead’s “requirements of public accessibility \nand formality are applicable in the context of agency in-\nterpretations of regulations,” and consequently held that \n“[t]he non-public or informal understandings of agency \nofficials concerning the meaning of a regulation are thus \nnot relevant.” Id. at 54 (emphases added). In light of \nLachman, G.G. cannot (and does not) deny that the First \n \n \n\n5  \nCircuit would not have deferred to the Ferg-Cadima let-\nter had this case arisen there. \nThe same is true of the Seventh Circuit. Although \nG.G. is correct that the analysis in Keys v. Barnhart, 347 \nF.3d 990 (7th Cir. 2003), of informal agency interpreta-\ntions was arguably dicta, G.G. does not dispute that the \ndiscussion  of  that  issue  in  U.S.  Freightways  Corp.  v. \nCommissioner, 270 F.3d 1137 (7th Cir. 2001) (Wood, J.), \nwas essential to the holding there. Thus, under the hold-\ning in U.S. Freightways, the Ferg-Cadima letter would \nnot have received “full Chevron deference” had this case \narisen in the Seventh Circuit. Cf. id. at 1141–42.  \nTo be sure, as G.G. points out (at 19), U.S. Freight-\nways did not expressly discuss Auer. But the opinion \nclearly assumes that Mead overtook Auer as to regula-\ntions, just as it cabined Chevron as to statutes: Judge \nWood’s opinion noted that the same considerations that \nunder Mead preclude “full Chevron deference” to infor-\nmal agency interpretations of statutes also preclude such \ndeference to informal interpretations of regulations. Id. \nat 1142. And Judge Posner’s subsequent opinion in Keys \nmade that view explicit as to Auer—leaving no doubt on \nthat point in the Seventh Circuit. See Keys, 347 F.3d at \n993. \nAs to the Eleventh Circuit: G.G. does not dispute that \nthe decision below conflicts with Arriaga v. Florida Pa-\ncific Farms, L.L.C., 305 F.3d 1228, 1238 (11th Cir. 2002), \nwhich applied Skidmore rather than Auer to opinion let-\nters interpreting agency regulations. Nor does G.G. dis-\npute that, under Arriaga, the Eleventh Circuit would not \n \n \n\n6  \nhave deferred to the Ferg-Cadima letter. Instead, G.G. \nsuggests that Eleventh Circuit law is unclear because, \nthree years before Arriaga, the Eleventh Circuit applied \nAuer to an informal opinion letter “without explanation.” \nOpp. 20 (citing Falken v. Glynn Cty., 197 F.3d 1341, 1350 \n(11th Cir. 1999)). But the “explanation” for the shift is \nobvious: Mead was decided in the interim and, as already \nexplained, is incompatible with Auer. \nThere can thus be no doubt that this case would have \ncome out differently if it had arisen in the First, Seventh, \nor Eleventh Circuits. In short, the 4-3 split identified in \nthe  petition  concerning  deference  to  informal  agency \nopinions is real.1 \n                                                   \n1 G.G. also mistakenly asserts that this case does not implicate the \nsecond division discussed in the petition—over whether Auer ap-\nplies to positions first articulated in the dispute at issue. See Pet. \n30–31. Contrary to G.G.’s assertion (at 20), the Department’s “inter-\npretation of § 106.33 dates back” only to 2015, not to “2013.”  See \nApp. 18a (noting United States requested deference to “OCR’s Jan-\nuary 7, 2015 letter”); App. 23a (noting “the Department’s interpreta-\ntion is novel because there was no interpretation as to how § 106.33 \napplied to transgender individuals before January 2015”). And that \n2015 “interpretation” arose out of a request concerning the policy in \nthis case. See Pet. 8–9. \n \n \n\n7  \nIII. THIS  CASE  IS  AN  EXCELLENT  VEHICLE \nFOR  RESOLVING  BOTH  THE  DIVISIONS \nOVER  AUER  AND  THE  PROPER \nINTERPRETATION  OF  TITLE  IX  AND  ITS \nREGULATION. \nG.G. incorrectly suggests that other concerns make \nthis case a poor vehicle for resolving the divisions over \nAuer and the proper interpretation of Title IX.  \nA. This Case Presents No Finality Concerns. \nG.G. first suggests that this case is a bad vehicle be-\ncause the judgment below is nonfinal. Opp. 23–25. But \nthe Court’s general reluctance to review cases “in an in-\nterlocutory posture” is inapplicable here. Mount Soledad \nMem’l Ass’n v. Trunk, 132 S. Ct. 2535, 2536 (2012) (Alito, \nJ., concurring in denial of certiorari). \nFirst, the Fourth Circuit’s decision turned on a pure \nquestion of law—whether the Ferg-Cadima letter merits \nAuer  deference.  App.  71a–72a.  The  Board’s  petition \ntherefore does not implicate the subsidiary factual mat-\nters alluded to by G.G. See Opp. 4 & nn. 2–3, 27 (discuss-\ning questions regarding transgender people). As Judge \nNiemeyer observed, “the facts of this case, in particular, \nare especially ‘clean,’ such as to enable the [Supreme] \nCourt to address the [legal] issue without the distraction \nof subservient issues.” App. 65a. \nSecond, there is no question about the ultimate im-\npact of the decision below. Following the Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision, the district court immediately entered a pre-\nliminary injunction based entirely on that decision. Pet. \n \n \n\n8  \n16.  This  case  thus  sharply  contrasts  with  cases  like \nMount  Soledad,  in  which  at  the  time  certiorari  was \nsought, “it remain[ed] unclear precisely what action the \n. . . Government will be required to take” as a result of \nthe court of appeals’ decision. 132 S. Ct. at 2536 (Alito, J., \nconcurring). Here there is no doubt about the ultimate \noutcome in the district court—the injunction has already \nbeen entered—or in the subsequent Fourth Circuit ap-\npeal. \nThird, the Board has also sought certiorari before \njudgment  in  the  second  Fourth  Circuit  appeal  (which \nchallenges the district court’s injunction) even as it seeks \nreview of the Fourth Circuit’s earlier decision. Pet. 17. \nIndeed, when seeking a stay the Board told this Court it \nwould seek review in both cases—see Reply in Supp. of \nStay at 4—and the Court consequently stayed both cas-\nes. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G., 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016) \n(per curiam). If the Court wishes to have the preliminary \ninjunction before it as well as the Fourth Circuit’s deci-\nsion, the petition provides that option.  \nMoreover, this case meets Rule 11’s standard for cer-\ntiorari  before  judgment  as  well  as  the  usual  Rule  10 \nstandards. Given that the Fourth Circuit’s decision im-\nmediately  spawned  a  nationwide  transgender  non-\ndiscrimination policy imposed by mid-ranking officials at \nthe Departments of Justice and Education, this is un-\ndoubtedly a case of “imperative public importance.” Pet. \n14–16. And this Court has not hesitated to review prelim-\ninary-injunction decisions that, like the decision below, \ninvolve pure questions of law and present issues of na-\ntionwide significance. See, e.g., United States v. Texas, \n \n \n\n9  \n136 S. Ct. 906 (2016) (granting certiorari); Obergefell v. \nHodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015); Glossip v. Gross, 135 S. \nCt. 2726 (2015); Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 \nS. Ct. 2751 (2014); Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. \n2492 (2012); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. \n460 (2009); Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst. Rights, \nInc., 547 U.S. 47 (2006); Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. \n968 (1997). \nB. This Case Is A Superior Vehicle For Revis-\niting Auer In A Setting In Which It Is Hav-\ning Nationwide Impact. \nG.G. is also mistaken in suggesting that in various re-\nspects the Fourth Circuit’s decision is too narrow to be a \ngood vehicle for resolving the questions presented. Opp. \n25, 27–28.  \nFirst, the precise question decided below makes this \ncase an ideal vehicle for considering how best to curtail \nAuer. The Fourth Circuit held that Auer requires defer-\nence to an informal, unpublished letter, written by a low-\nlevel agency official, in the context of the very dispute in \nwhich deference was sought. Pet. 8. The decision thus \nputs Auer’s defects on maximum display. See, e.g., Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1217 (2015) \n(Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) (stating that \nAuer  effects  an  unconstitutional  “transfer  of  judicial \npower to the Executive Branch”); Christensen v. Harris \nCty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (“Interpretations such as \nthose in opinion letters—like interpretations contained \nin policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement \n \n \n\n10  \nguidelines, all of which lack the force of law—do not \nwarrant Chevron-style deference.”). \nSecond, G.G.’s suggestion that the Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision “concern[s] access to restrooms only” is false. \nOpp. 25. The letter to which the court deferred extends \nbeyond  restrooms  to  facilities  such  as  “locker  rooms, \nshower facilities, [and] housing.” App. 123a. The United \nStates has already told a federal district court that “the \nreasoning of Gloucester’s holding applies to changing fa-\ncilities with equal force.” Mem. in Supp. of Prelim. Inj. at \n15, in United States v. North Carolina, No. 1:16-cv-00425 \n(M.D.N.C. July 5, 2016), ECF No. 74. And G.G.’s counsel \nhas taken the same position. See Mem. in Supp. of Pre-\nlim. Inj. at 14, Carcaño v. McCrory, No. 1:16-cv-00236 \n(M.D.N.C. May 16, 2016), ECF No. 23 (arguing “[t]he \nFourth Circuit’s controlling decision in G.G. applies with \nequal  force  to  ‘changing  facilities,’  such  as  locker \nrooms”).  \nBut even if the Fourth Circuit’s decision were limited \nto restrooms, it would still merit this Court’s review. See, \ne.g., Texas v. United States (App. 219a–223a, 229a) (re-\njecting G.G. and issuing nationwide injunction against \nfederal  edicts  regarding  transgender  access  to  school \nrestrooms); Order at 4–5, Carcaño v. McCrory, No. 1:16-\ncv-00236 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 26, 2016), ECF No. 127 (follow-\ning  G.G.  and  issuing  preliminary  injunction  against \nNorth Carolina law concerning restroom access). Even if \nso limited, the decision rests on an indefensible applica-\ntion of Auer that is already having nationwide impact. \nSee Pet. 3, 14–16, 31–32. This case is therefore an ideal \ncandidate for reconsidering Auer’s deference regime.           \n \n \n\n11  \nC. The  Department’s  Interpretation  Of  Title \nIX  And  Its  Implementing  Regulation  Is \nNot  Entitled  To  Deference  Under  Any \nStandard. \nG.G.’s attempt to defend the Department’s interpre-\ntation of Title IX and its implementing regulation is also \nmeritless. See Opp. 29–36. Although full exploration of \nthat issue should await merits briefing, the Department’s \ninterpretation cannot bear scrutiny under any deference \nstandard,  save  perhaps  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  rubber-\nstamp regime. \nFirst, the Ferg-Cadima letter interprets—not mere-\nly the regulation—but the term “sex” in the Title IX \nstatute. See App. 121a (“Title IX” bans discrimination \n“on the basis of sex, including gender identity”) (empha-\nsis added). But Auer does not apply to an agency inter-\npretation of the underlying statute, Gonzales v. Oregon, \n546 U.S. 243, 256–57 (2006), and informal opinion letters \ndo not receive Chevron deference under Mead. Christen-\nsen, 529 U.S. at 587. See also Pet. 8, 31 n.11; Jonathan H. \nAdler, What “Sex” Has to Do with Seminole Rock, Yale \nJ.  Reg.:  Notice  &  Comment  (Sept.  16,  2016), \nhttp://yalejreg.com/nc/what-sex-has-to-do-with-seminole-\nrock-by-jonathan-h-adler/ (“[T]he relevant ambiguity ex-\nists in the underlying statutory language as well. . . . In \nsuch cases, agency interpretations of their own regula-\ntions are, for all practical purposes, interpretations of \nthe statute, and are therefore only eligible for deference \nunder Chevron—and Chevron (as explicated in Mead) \nrequires an agency to do more than issue a guidance let-\nter or file a brief.”).  \n \n \n\n12  \nSecond,  even  assuming  the  regulation  were  suffi-\nciently  ambiguous  to  invoke  Auer,  cf.  Pet.  11,  33–34, \nG.G.’s own argument shows that the Board’s policy satis-\nfies the regulation. G.G. concedes that “[t]he term ‘sex’ in \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33, as in the underlying statute, encom-\npasses all physiological, anatomical, and behavioral as-\npects of sex.” Opp. 30 (emphasis added). But the Board’s \npolicy itself treats sex as a “physiological” and “anatomi-\ncal” concept. See App. 144a (limiting restrooms and lock-\ner rooms to “biological” sexes). The policy would only \nviolate the regulation if “sex” means only “gender identi-\nty,” which, as the district court explained, would be ab-\nsurd. App. 99a, 102a.    \nThird, G.G. candidly admits (at 1) that the Depart-\nment’s interpretation of “sex” would have been unfath-\nomable when the regulation was adopted. But this is an \nadmission  that  Auer  cannot  justify  the  Department’s \nnovel interpretation. See, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. \nShalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994) (noting that an agency \ninterpretation is not entitled to deference if alternative \nreading is “compelled by the regulation’s plain language \nor by other indications of the Secretary’s intent at the \ntime of the regulation’s promulgation”). It is also an ad-\nmission that the Congress that enacted Title IX never \nintended to delegate to the Department the prerogative \nto resolve complex issues of transgender access to re-\nstrooms.  See  Mead,  533  U.S.  at  229–34  (noting  that \nChevron  applies  only  when  Congress  affirmatively  in-\ntends to delegate interpretive authority). \nFinally, G.G. suggests that such a delegation is never-\ntheless found in 20 U.S.C. § 1682. Opp. 34. But that stat-\n \n \n\n13  \nute authorizes Federal agencies empowered to adminis-\nter educational funding to effectuate Title IX only “by \nissuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicabil-\nity,” which, moreover, must be “approved by the Presi-\ndent.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. The Ferg-Cadima letter obvious-\nly does not qualify. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n14  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be grant-\ned.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nJONATHAN F.

Gavin Grimm (“Gavin”) is a 19-year-old young man who is transgender. When\nGavin was 15, he came out to his family as a boy and, with the help of his medical providers, \ntransitioned to living in accordance with his male identity as part of medically necessary \ntreatment for gender dysphoria.  \n2. By the time Gavin began his sophomore year at Gloucester High School, he had\nlegally changed his name to Gavin and begun using male pronouns. Gavin wore his clothing and \nhairstyles in a manner typical of other boys and used the men’s restrooms in public venues, \nincluding restaurants, libraries, and shopping centers, without encountering any problems. \nGavin’s medical providers also gave him a “treatment documentation letter,” which confirmed \nthat Gavin was receiving treatment for gender dysphoria and stated that he should be treated as a \nboy in all respects, including when using the restroom.  \n3. With the support of the school principal and superintendent, Gavin used the boys’\nrestrooms at Gloucester High School for approximately seven weeks without incident. \n1 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 2 of 19 PageID# 1685\n4. But in response to complaints from some adults in the community, the Gloucester\nCounty School Board (the “Board”) overruled its own administrators and enacted a new policy \nprohibiting boys and girls “with gender identity issues” from using the same restrooms as other \nboys and girls. The new policy directed students who are transgender to an “alternative \nappropriate private facility.”  \n5. The Board continued to exclude Gavin from using the same restrooms as other\nboys, even after he began receiving hormone therapy, obtained a Virginia state I.D. card listing \nhis sex as male, underwent chest reconstruction surgery, obtained a court order legally changing \nhis sex to male under Virginia law, and received a new Virginia birth certificate reflecting that \nhis sex is male. \n6. Throughout the rest of high school, Gavin was forced to use separate restrooms\nthat no other student was required to use. That degrading and stigmatizing policy singled Gavin \nout as unfit to use the same restrooms that are available to every other student. \n7. The Board’s policy conflicts with the views of every major medical and mental\nhealth organization and school counselors’, teachers’, and administrators’ organizations across \nthe country.  \n8. In every part of the country, including Virginia, boys and girls who are\ntransgender are already using sex-separated restroom and locker room facilities at school, \nparticipating in interscholastic athletic teams in both high school and college, and joining girl-\nscout and boy-scout troops.  \n9. Ignoring these realities, the Gloucester County School Board has adhered to its\ncategorical ban, which prohibits the Board’s own school administrators from ever allowing any \n2 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 3 of 19 PageID# 1686\n \nstudent who is transgender to use the common facilities that are available to every other boy and \ngirl.  \n10.  Gavin is recognized by his family, his medical providers, the Virginia Department \nof Health, and the world at large as a boy. Allowing him to use the same restrooms as other boys \nis the only way to provide him access to sex-separated restrooms without discrimination.  \n11.  By segregating Gavin from his peers, excluding him from using the same \nrestrooms that every other boy is allowed to use, and relegating him to separate restroom \nfacilities, the Board discriminated against Gavin, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  \n12.  The Board also continues to discriminate against Gavin by refusing to update his \nofficial school transcript to match the male sex on his birth certificate, despite Gavin’s repeated \nrequests.  As a result, every time Gavin is required to provide a high school transcript to a \ncollege or potential employer, he must provide a transcript that—unlike all his other \nidentification documents—declares that his sex is “female.” The Board thus continues to \nstigmatize and humiliate Gavin by treating Gavin differently from every other graduating student \nwith a male birth certificate, in violation of Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment. \n13.  Gavin seeks redress from this Court. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This action arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681, et seq., the Constitution of the United States, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nDeclaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n3 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 4 of 19 PageID# 1687\n \n15.  Venue lies with this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1)-(2), because the \ndefendant resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n16.  Plaintiff Gavin Grimm (“Gavin”) is nineteen years old. From September 2013 to \nJune 2017, he attended Gloucester High School, a public high school in Gloucester County, \nVirginia.  \n17.  The Gloucester County School Board (the “School Board” or “Board”) is an \nelected body responsible for the operation of the Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”), \nincluding the promulgation of policies. At all times relevant, the School Board has acted and \ncontinues to act under color of state law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nTransgender youth and gender dysphoria \n18.  Gavin was born in Gloucester County and has lived in Gloucester County his \nentire life. Gavin is a typical teenager who is articulate and intelligent, reads broadly, loves his \ndog and cats, and enjoys hanging out with his friends.  \n19.  When Gavin was born, the hospital staff identified him as female, but from a \nyoung age, Gavin knew that he was a boy. Although the sex assigned to Gavin at birth was \nfemale, Gavin has a male gender identity. \n20.   Everyone has a gender identity. It is an established medical concept, referring to \na person’s deeply felt, inherent sense of one’s gender. Most people have a gender identity that \nmatches the sex they are identified as at birth. But people who are transgender have a gender \nidentity that differs from the sex they are assigned at birth.  \n4 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 5 of 19 PageID# 1688\n \n21.  Like many students who are transgender, Gavin succeeded at school until the \nonset of puberty, when he began to suffer debilitating levels of distress from gender dysphoria, a \ncondition in which individuals who are transgender experience persistent and clinically \nsignificant distress caused by the incongruence between their gender identity and the sex \nassigned to them at birth. Although gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition recognized \nby the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(5th ed. 2013), being transgender is not a mental disorder and “implies no impairment in \njudgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.” Am. Psychiatric \nAss’n, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender & Gender Variant Individuals \n(2012).  \n22.  There is a medical and scientific consensus that the treatment for gender \ndysphoria is for boys who are transgender to live as boys and for girls who are transgender to \nlive as girls. When medically appropriate, treatment also includes hormone therapy and surgery. \nThis medical consensus is embraced by the American Medical Association, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the National Endocrine Society, and every other major medical and mental health \norganization in the United States. \n23.  The ability of individuals who are transgender to live consistently with their \nidentity is critical to their health and well-being. That includes using names and pronouns \nconsistent with their identity, grooming and dressing in a manner typically associated with that \ngender, and using restrooms and other sex-separated facilities that match their gender identity. \nPreventing students who are transgender from living in a manner that is consistent with their \ngender identity puts them at increased risk of debilitating depression and suicide. By contrast, \n5 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 6 of 19 PageID# 1689\nwhen gender dysphoria is properly treated, individuals who are transgender experience profound \nrelief and can go on to lead healthy, happy, and successful lives. \n24. Boys and girls who are transgender are people who consistently, persistently, and\ninsistently do not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth, and who can experience the \ndebilitating distress of gender dysphoria when they are not able to live as the boys and girls that \nthey are. The gender identity of these adolescents is stable and fixed.  \n25. Boys and girls who are transgender are attending schools across the country.\nWhile students who are transgender have long been part of school communities, it is only in the \nlast couple decades that there has been more widespread access to the medical and psychological \nsupport that they need. Beginning in the early 2000s, as a result of advances in medical and \npsychological treatment, students who are transgender finally began to receive the treatment \nnecessary to alleviate the devastating pain of gender dysphoria and live their lives in accordance \nwith who they really are.  \n26. Many students who are transgender attend school without classmates and peers\nknowing they are transgender. For example, many students have already transitioned before \nbeginning school and many others transfer to a new school after transitioning.  \n27. With hormone therapy, students who are transgender develop physical sex\ncharacteristics typical of their gender identity—not the sex they were identified as at birth. \nHormone therapy affects bone and muscle structure, alters the appearance of a person’s genitals, \nand produces secondary sex characteristics such as facial and body hair in boys and breasts in \ngirls.  \n28. In addition, children who are transgender who receive puberty blockers never go\nthrough puberty as their birth-designated sex. They will be exposed to the same levels of \n6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 7 of 19 PageID# 1690\ntestosterone or estrogen as other boys and girls during puberty, and those hormones will affect \nevery major body system.  \n29. Under widely accepted standards of care developed by the World Professional\nAssociation of Transgender Health (“WPATH”), genital surgery is not recommended for minors, \nbut boys who are transgender may undergo medically necessary chest-reconstruction surgery \nafter they turn 16.  \n30. According to every major medical and mental health organization, including the\nAmerican Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, and the American Psychological Association, excluding boys and girls who are \ntransgender from using the same restrooms as other boys and girls is harmful to their health and \nwellbeing. When excluded from the common restrooms, students who are transgender often \navoid using the restroom entirely, either because the separate restrooms are too stigmatizing or \ntoo difficult to access. They suffer infections and other negative health consequences as a result \nof avoiding restroom use. The exclusion also increases their risk of depression and self-harm. \n31. Educators and school administrators across the country also recognize that\nexcluding boys and girls who are transgender from using the common restrooms interferes with \ntheir ability to learn and thrive at school. It impairs their ability to develop a healthy sense of \nself, peer relationships, and the cognitive skills necessary to succeed in adult life. In light of \nthese harms, the National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, National Association of Elementary School Principals, and the \nAmerican School Counselor Association have all called upon schools to allow boys and girls \nwho are transgender to use the same restrooms as other boys and girls. \n7 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 8 of 19 PageID# 1691\n \n32.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and \nmental health organizations, there is no evidence that allowing boys and girls who are \ntransgender to use the same restrooms as other boys and girls causes any harm to the physical or \nmental health of students who are not transgender. \n33.  Schools can provide accommodations for all students—whether transgender or \nnot—to enhance their own privacy without discriminating against students who are transgender \nby excluding them from common spaces. \n34.  In schools across the country, including Virginia, boys and girls who are \ntransgender already use the same restrooms and locker rooms as other boys and girls. \n35.  In high school athletic associations across the country, including Virginia, boys \nand girls who are transgender already play on the same sports teams as other boys and girls.  \n36.  Institutions ranging from the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts to the Seven Sisters \ncolleges to the National Collegiate Athletic Association already recognize boys who are \ntransgender as boys and recognize girls who are transgender as girls.  \n37.  Treating boys who are transgender as boys, and treating girls who are transgender \nas girls, is the only way they can equally participate in school, work, or society at large. \nGavin’s experience at Gloucester High School  \n38.  In 2014, near the end of his first year of high school, the distress caused by \nGavin’s untreated gender dysphoria became so great that he was unable to attend class. At that \npoint, Gavin came out to his parents as a boy and, at his request, began seeing a psychologist \nwith experience counseling youth who are transgender.  \n39.  With the help of his medical providers, Gavin transitioned to living in accordance \nwith his male identity as part of medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.  \n8 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 9 of 19 PageID# 1692\n40. Gavin legally changed his name to Gavin and began using male pronouns. Gavin\nwore his clothing and hairstyles in a manner typical of other boys and began using the men’s \nrestrooms in public venues, including restaurants, libraries, and shopping centers, without \nencountering any problems. His medical providers also referred Gavin to an endocrinologist to \nbegin hormone therapy. \n41. Gavin and his mother met with the school guidance counselor in August 2014,\nbefore the beginning of his sophomore year, to explain that Gavin is a boy who is transgender \nand would be attending school as a boy.  \n42. Gavin and his mother gave the guidance counselor a “treatment documentation\nletter” from his psychologist, which confirmed that Gavin was receiving treatment for gender \ndysphoria and stated that he should be treated as a boy in all respects, including when using the \nrestroom.  \n43. At the time Gavin and his mother met with the guidance counselor, the School\nBoard did not have policies addressing which restrooms students who are transgender should \nuse.  \n44. Gavin initially agreed to use the restroom in the nurse’s office, but he soon felt\nstigmatized and isolated using a different restroom from everyone else. The restroom in the \nnurse’s office was also located far away from many of his school classes, and Gavin was often \nunable to use the restroom without being late for class.  \n45. After a few weeks of using the restroom in the nurse’s office, Gavin sought\npermission to use the boys’ restrooms. \n46. On October 20, 2014, with the school principal’s support, Gavin began using the\nboys’ restrooms, and did so for seven weeks without incident. \n9 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 10 of 19 PageID# 1693\n \n47.  Gavin also requested permission to complete his physical-education requirements \nthrough a home-bound program. As a result, he never needed to use the locker rooms at school. \n48.  The principal of Gloucester High School and the superintendent of Gloucester \nCounty Public Schools informed the Board that they had authorized Gavin to use the same \nrestrooms as other boys, but otherwise kept the matter confidential.  \n49.  Although the principal and superintendent treated the matter as confidential, some \nadults in the community learned that a boy who is transgender was using the boys’ restrooms at \nGloucester High School. They contacted the Board to demand that the transgender student (who \nwas not publicly identified as Gavin until later) be barred from the boys’ restrooms. \n50.  On information and belief, at least some of the complaints came from a \nGloucester High School employee who runs the school Bible club and is a pastor at a local \nchurch. That employee told the Washington Post that he spoke out against Gavin’s use of the \nboys’ restroom because “God puts us on this Earth as who we are.” \n51.  The Board considered the matter at a private meeting and took no action for \nseveral weeks.  \n52.  Unsatisfied with the results of the private meeting, one member of the Board \nalerted the broader community by proposing the following policy for public debate at the \nBoard’s meeting on November 11, 2014:  \nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and \n \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, and  \n \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \n \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room \nfacilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding \n10 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 11 of 19 PageID# 1694\n \nbiological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an \nalternative appropriate private facility. \n \n53.  The policy categorically prohibits administrators from allowing any boy who is \ntransgender to use any boys’ restroom (or allowing any girl who is transgender to use any girls’ \nrestroom) in any school within the Gloucester County School District, regardless of the student’s \nindividual circumstances.  \n54.  The policy does not define “biological gender,” and the term has no common or \naccepted meaning. There are many biological components of sex, including chromosomal, \nanatomical, hormonal, and reproductive elements, some of which could be ambiguous or in \nconflict within an individual, either because that individual has intersex traits or because that \nindividual has undergone medical care for gender dysphoria.  \n55.  After learning about the meeting through social media, Gavin and his parents \ndecided to speak against the proposed policy. In order to speak against the policy, Gavin was \nforced to reveal himself to the entire community and the local media as the boy whose restroom \nuse was at issue. \n56.  Gavin told the Board:  \nI use the public restroom, the men’s public restroom, in every public space in \nGloucester County and others. I have never once had any sort of confrontation of \nany kind. \n… \nAll I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace, and I have had \nno problems from students to do that—only from adults. \n… \nI did not ask to be this way, and it’s one of the most difficult things anyone can \nface.  \n… \nI am just a human. I am just a boy. \n \nA recording of his remarks can be viewed online at https://goo.gl/CYh4gd \n11 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 12 of 19 PageID# 1695\n57. By a vote of 4-3, the School Board voted to defer a vote on the policy until its\nmeeting on December 9, 2014. \n58. Before its next meeting, the Board issued a press release announcing plans for\n“adding or expanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, and adding privacy strips to \nthe doors of stalls in all restrooms.” In addition, the press release announced “plans to designate \nsingle stall, unisex restrooms … to give all students the option for even greater privacy.”  \n59. Speakers at the December 9, 2014 Board meeting nonetheless demanded that\nGavin be excluded from the boys’ restrooms immediately, and many threatened to vote Board \nmembers out of office if they refused to pass the new policy. \n60. With Gavin in attendance, several speakers pointedly referred to him as a “young\nlady.” One speaker called Gavin a “freak” and compared him to a person who thinks he is a \n“dog” and wants to urinate on fire hydrants. “Put him in a separate bathroom if that’s what it’s \ngoing to take,” said another. \n61. The Board meeting made Gavin feel that he had been turned into a public\nspectacle in front of the entire community. \n62. The Board passed the policy on December 9, 2014, by a 6-1 vote.\n63. The following day, the principal told Gavin he could no longer use the same\nrestrooms as other boys. \n64. The Board’s new policy did not affect the restroom usage of any other student at\nGloucester High School. Every other student was allowed to continue using the same restrooms \nthey had been using before the new policy was adopted. The only person who had to use a \ndifferent restroom was Gavin. \n12 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 13 of 19 PageID# 1696\n65. The Board subsequently installed three single-user restrooms. One of the\nrestrooms had previously been designated as a restroom for teachers and staff. The other two \nrestrooms were converted from old utility closets.  \n66. None of the single-user restrooms was located near Gavin’s classes.\n67. Although any student was allowed to use the single-user restrooms, no one else\ndid so. Everyone knew they were created for Gavin as part of the policy prohibiting him from \nusing the same restrooms as other boys. \n68. Being relegated to the separate restrooms was demeaning and shameful for\nGavin. It signaled to Gavin and the entire school community that he is different, and it sent a \npublic message to all his peers that he is not fit to be treated like everyone else.  \n69. Gavin did everything he could to avoid using the restroom at school. As a result,\nhe developed painful urinary tract infections and was often distracted and uncomfortable in class. \n70. When Gavin absolutely had to use the restroom, he used the nurse’s restroom, but\nhe still felt ashamed doing so. Every time he had to walk to the other side of school to use the \nnurse’s restroom, Gavin felt like he was taking a “walk of shame.” It was a constant reminder to \nGavin—and to anyone who saw him—that Gavin is transgender and had been barred from using \nthe same restrooms as other boys. \n71. Being excluded from the common boys’ restroom and forced to use separate\nrestroom facilities also physically isolated Gavin from the rest of his peers by requiring him to \ntravel to a separate part of the school if he had to use the restroom between classes.  \n72. When Gavin attended school football games, there was no restroom for him to use\nat all. The Gloucester High School building was locked after school, and there are no single-user \n13 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 14 of 19 PageID# 1697\n \nrestroom facilities in the stadium. When he had to use the restroom, Gavin’s only option was to \ncall his mother to pick him up and take him home early. \nEnforcement of the policy  \n \n73.  The Board continued to exclude Gavin from the same restrooms as other boys \nthroughout the remainder of his sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. \n74.  In December 2014, Gavin began hormone therapy, which has altered his bone and \nmuscle structure, deepened his voice, and caused him to grow facial hair.  \n75.  In June 2015, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued Gavin a state \nI.D. card identifying him as male.  \n76.  In June 2016, Gavin underwent chest-reconstruction surgery, in accordance with \nthe medical standards of care for treating gender dysphoria. \n77.  On September 9, 2016, the Gloucester County Circuit Court issued an order \nchanging Gavin’s sex under Virginia state law and directing the Virginia Department of Health \nto issue Gavin a birth certificate listing his sex as male.  \n78.  On October 27, 2016, the Virginia Department of Health issued Gavin a birth \nlisting his sex as male. \n79.  Despite all of this, the Board disregarded Gavin’s medical treatment, his Virginia \nI.D. card, his new Virginia birth certificate, and the court order changing his sex under Virginia \nstate law. The Board maintained that Gavin’s “biological gender” remains female and continued \nto prohibit its administrators from allowing Gavin to use the boys’ restrooms. \nRefusal to update gender designation on Gavin’s official transcript \n \n80.  During his senior year, Gavin received an updated Virginia birth certificate \nreflecting that his sex is male and provided that birth certificate to school administrators. But \n14 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 15 of 19 PageID# 1698\n \ndespite Gavin’s repeated requests, the Board refused to update his official school transcript to \nmatch the male sex on his birth certificate. In doing so, the Board once again singled out Gavin \nfor different treatment from every other student at Gloucester High School with a male birth \ncertificate. \n81.  Every time Gavin is required to provide a high school transcript to a college or \nemployer, he must provide a transcript that—unlike all his other identification documents—\ndeclares that his sex is “female.”  \n82.  Gavin graduated high school on June 10, 2017. But by refusing to update Gavin’s \nofficial school transcript, the Board continues to stigmatize and humiliate Gavin to this day. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n83.  The Board is the final policymaker for Gloucester County Public Schools, acting \nunder color of state law. \n84.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board treated Gavin \ndifferently from similarly situated students in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n85.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board discriminated against \nGavin on the basis of gender, which is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause. \n86.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board discriminated against \n15 \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 16 of 19 PageID# 1699\nGavin on the basis of transgender status, which is also subject to heightened scrutiny under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  \na. People who are transgender as a class have historically been subject to\ndiscrimination.\nb. People who are transgender as a class have a defining characteristic that\nfrequently bears no relation to an ability to perform or contribute to society. \nc. People who are transgender as a class exhibit immutable or distinguishing\ncharacteristics that define them as a discrete group. \nd. People who are transgender as a class are a minority with relatively little political\npower. \n87. By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is\nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board discriminated against \nGavin based on invidious stereotypes, moral disapproval, and unfounded fears about people who \nare different. \n88. By refusing to update Gavin’s official school transcript to match the male\ndesignation on his updated birth certificate, the Board has discriminated—and continues to \ndiscriminate—against Gavin.  \n89. The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not narrowly tailored to advance a\ncompelling government interest. \n90. The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not substantially related to any\nimportant government interest. \n91. The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not rationally related to any\nlegitimate government interest. \n16 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 17 of 19 PageID# 1700\n92. The Board is liable for its violation of Gavin’s Fourteenth Amendment rights\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nCOUNT II \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n93. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). \n94. Gloucester County Public Schools and Gloucester High School are education\nprograms receiving Federal financial assistance. \n95. By prohibiting Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is\nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board violated his rights \nunder Title IX. \n96. By refusing to update Gavin’s official school transcript to match the male\ndesignation on his updated birth certificate, the Board violated—and continues to violate—his \nrights under Title IX. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA. A declaration that the Board’s policy violated Gavin’s rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., on the day the policy was first issued and throughout the \nremainder of his time as a student at Gloucester High School; \n17 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 177   Filed 02/15/19   Page 18 of 19 PageID# 1701\nB.

For the following reasons, the Board's Motion\nto Strike is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, Mr. Grimm's Motion for Summary\nJudgment is GRANTED,a nd the Board's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nGavin Grimm is a twenty-year-old man who attended Gloucester High School, a public\nhigh school in Gloucester County, Virginia, from September 2013 until his graduation in June\n2017. See Gavin Grimm Decl.  3, 5, ECF No. 186. When Mr. Grimm was bom, hospital staff\nidentified him as female. Id.^   7. Despite this designation, Mr. Grimm has always \"related to male\ncharacters\" and \"ha[s] always known that[ he is] a boy.\" Id. ^ 6.\nWhen Mr. Grimm enrolled in the Gloucester County School System, he was listed as a girl.\nHe began his freshman year in 2013 at Gloucester High School with a female birth certificate.\nAndersen Decl., ECF No. 196-6.\n1\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 2 of 28 PageID# 3536\nIn April 2014, Mr. Grimm disclosed to his parents that he was transgender. Gavin Grimm\nDecl. H 20; Deirdre Grimm Decl. ^ 7, ECF No. 187. According to Dr. Melinda Penn, M.D.,^\n\"gender identity\" refers to \"a person's innate sense of belonging to a particular gender.\" Penn\nExpert Rep. and Decl. H 17, ECF No. 192-3. She opines that people's gender identity usually\nmatches the sex consistent with their external genitalia possessed at birth, but that transgender\nindividuals have a gender identity different from the one assigned to them at birth. Id.  18-19.\nAt Mr. Grimm's request, he began therapy in May 2014 with Dr. Lisa Griffin, Ph.D., a\npsychologist with experience counseling transgender youth. Gavin Grimm Decl.^  24. Dr. Griffin\ndiagnosed Mr. Grimm with gender dysphoria. Id. Dr. Griffin prepared a treatment documentation\nletter stating that Mr. Grimm has gender dysphoria, that he should present as a male in his daily\nlife, that he should be considered and treated as a male, and that he should be allowed to use\nrestrooms consistent with that identity. ECF No. 186-1 at 1.\nThe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders( \"DSM V\")d efines \"gender dysphoria\" as a condition experienced by some transgender\npeople that inflicts clinically significant stress because their gender identity differs from the sex\nassigned to them at birth. Penn Expert Rep. and Decl.  21. Dr. Penn's report explains that \"to be\ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria, the incongruence [between gender identity and assigned sex]\nmust have persisted for at least six months and be accompanied by clinically significant distress\nor impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\" Id.\n' Mr. Grimm retained Dr. Penn to \"provide expert testimony on the applicable standards of care and treatment\nguidelines for transgender youth.\" ECF No. 214-2 at 1. Dr. Penn is a pediatric endocrinologist with the Children's\nHospital of the King's Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia, holds a medical degree from Eastern Virginia Medical School,\nand is board certified in pediatric endocrinology by the American Board of Pediatrics. ECF No. 192-3 THI3-4. One\nof her specialties is transgender health. Id.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 3 of 28 PageID# 3537\nDuring the course of his treatment for gender dysphoria, Mr. Grimm changed his first name\nlegally to Gavin and began using male pronouns to describe himself. Gavin Grimm Decl.  23,\n25. He also began using men's restrooms in public venues. Id.  37,38. Dr. Griffin referred Mr.\nGrimm to an endocrinologist for hormone treatment around this time. Id. ^ 24.\nIn August 2014, before the beginning of Mr. Grimm's sophomore year, Mr. Grimm and\nhis mother met with Ms. Tiffany Durr, a school guidance counselor. Id.  26-27. They gave Ms.\nDurr a copy of Dr. Griffin's treatment documentation letter and requested that Mr. Grimm be\ntreated as a boy at school. Id. Mr. Grimm and Ms. Durr agreed that Mr. Grimm would use the\nrestroom in the nurse's office. Id. ^ 29.\nMr. Grimm \"soon found it stigmatizing to use a separate restroom,\" however, and \"began\nto feel anxiety and shame surrounding [his] travel to the nurse's office.\" Id. He also found that\nthe distance to this bathroom caused him to be late to class. Id.\nAfter a few weeks of using the restroom in the nurse's office, Mr. Grimm met with Ms.\nDurr and sought permission to use the school's male restrooms. Id.^   33; Durr Dep. 23:6-17, ECF\nNo. 192-11. Ms. Durr relayed Mr. Grimm's request to Principal Nate Collins. Durr Dep. 24:1-\n17.

Principal Collins allowed Mr. Grimm to use the male restrooms. Collins Dep. 50:22-\n51:13.\nMr. Grimm used the male restrooms at Gloucester High School for seven weeks. Gavin\nGrimm Decl.^  36. During this time,t here were no incidents in the restrooms involving Mr. Grimm\nand other students. Id.  Mr. Grimm was given permission to complete his physical education\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 4 of 28 PageID# 3538\ncourses online and never needed to use the locker rooms at school. Gavin Grimm Dep. 96:14-\n97:9.\nSubsequently, however, Dr. demons, Principal Collins, and Board members began\nreceiving complaints from adult members of the community who had learned that a transgender\nboy was using male restrooms at the high school. See Collins Dep.6 6:1-22; demons Dep. 32:16-\n33:6; Def.'s Response to First Set of Interrogatories  1, ECF No. 192-1. Some members of the\ncommunity demanded that the transgender student be barred from the male restrooms. Id. One\nstudent personally complained to Principal Collins. ECF No. 192-1 ^ 1.\nFollowing these complaints. Board member Carla Hook proposed the following policy at\nthe Board's public meeting on November 11,2014:\nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities,\nand\nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance\nfrom parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and\nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students\nand to protect the privacy of all students, therefore\nIt shall be the practice oft he GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker\nroom facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the\ncorresponding biological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be\nprovided an alternative appropriate private facility.\nHook Nov. 9, 2014 Email, ECF No. 192-21.\nMr. Grimm and his parents spoke against the proposed policy at the November 11, 2014\nmeeting. Gavin Grimm Decl. ^ 40. The Board voted 4-3 to defer a decision regarding the policy\nuntil the next Board meeting on December 9, 2014.

Recorded\nMinutes of the Board, Dec. 9, 2014, at 3, BCF No. 192-23. The Board also announced that it\nwould construct single-stall, unisex restrooms for all students to use. Id. The following day.\nPrincipal Collins told Mr. Grimm that his further use of the male restrooms at Gloucester High\nSchool would result in disciplinary consequences. Collins Dec. 10, 2014 Memo to Deirdre and\nDavid Grimm, ECF No. 192-24; Gavin Grimm Decl. 1] 44.\nIn December 2014, Mr. Grimm began hormone therapy.  This \"deepened [his] voice,\nincreased [his] growth off acial hair, and [gave him] a more masculine appearance.\" Gavin Grimm\nDecl. H 60.\nSingle-user restrooms had not yet been constructed when the Board enacted the policy.\nGavin Grimm Decl. ^ 46. Mr. Grimm has recounted an incident when he stayed after school for\nan event, realized the nurse's office was locked, and broke down in tears because there was no\nrestroom he could use comfortably. Id. A librarian witnessed this and drove him home. Id.\nMr. Grimm also declared that when the single-user restrooms were built, they were located\nfar from classes that he attended. Id. ^ 49. A map of the school confirms that no single-user\nrestrooms were located in Hall D, where Mr. Grimm attended most classes. ECF Nos. 192-28,\n192-29. There was also no single-user restroom at the school's stadium, limiting Mr. Grimm's\nability to attend events there. Gavin Grimm Decl. ^ 52.\nThe single-stall restrooms made Mr. Grimm feel \"stigmatized and isolated.\" Id. ^ 47. He\nnever saw any other student use these restrooms. Id. ^ 48. Principal Collins testified at his\ndeposition that he never saw a student use the single-user restrooms, but that he assumed that they\nwere used because they were cleaned daily.

Gavin Grimm Decl.  61; ECF No. 41-2.\nDuring his junior year of high school, Mr. Grimm was admitted to the boys' ward at the\nhospital at Virginia Commonwealth University \"because he was having thoughts of suicide.\"\nDeirdre Grimm Decl. ^ 24.\nIn June 2016, Mr. Grimm underwent chest-reconstruction surgery. Grimm Decl. ^ 62.\nOn September 9, 2016, the Gloucester County Circuit Court issued an order declaring Mr.\nGrimm's sex to be male and directing the Virginia Department of Health to issue him a birth\ncertificate listing his sex as male. Id. T| 63; ECF No. 41-3. The order referred to Mr. Grimm's\nchest reconstruction surgery as \"gender reassignment surgery\" and concluded that Mr. Grimm is\n\"now functioning fully as a male.\" ECF No. 41-3.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Virginia Department of Health issued a birth certificate listing\nMr. Grimm's sex as male. Gavin Grimm Decl. H 64; ECF No. 41-4. After receiving an updated\nbirth certificate, Mr. Grimm and his mother provided Gloucester High School with a photocopy\nof it and asked that his school records be updated. Gavin Grimm Decl. ^ 66. The school has\ndeclined to correct Mr. Grimm's transcript, which still reflects his sex as female. ECF No. 41-5.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 7 of 28 PageID# 3541\nTroy Andersen, the Board's 30(b)(6) witness,^ testified that the Board has declined to\nupdate Mr. Grimm's transcripts because it believes that the amended birth certificate does not\naccord with Virginia law and because the photocopy presented was marked \"void.\" Andersen\nDep. 65:8-66:1, BCFNo. 192-13.\nOn January 18,2017,t he Board informed Mr. Grimm that he had a right to a hearing related\nto the Board's decision not to amend his official transcript and educational records. ECF No. 171-\nI. Mr. Grimm did not request a hearing.\nMr. Grimm graduated high school on June 10,2017. Gavin Grimm Decl.^  57. He is now\nattending Berkeley City College in California and intends to transfer to a four-year college. Id.\n1169.\nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nMr. Grimm commenced this action against the Board on June 11, 2015, at the end of his\nsophomore school year, alleging that the Board's policy of assigning students to restrooms based\non their biological sex violated Title DC of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §\n1681(a), and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.  ECF No. 1.  This Court considered the Board's motion to dismiss Mr.\nGrimm's Amended Complaint. On May 22, 2018, this Court denied the motion to dismiss. ECF\nNo. 148.\nIn doing so, this Court held that a plaintiffs claim of discrimination on the basis of\ntransgender status constitutes a viable claim of sex discrimination under Title IX. Id. at 13-21.\nSpecifically, this Court relied on Price Waterh ouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), which held\n^ Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6), if an organization is named as a deponent in a civil matter, the\norganization must designate one or more persons who consent to testify on its behalf. The Board designated Troy\nAndersen, a Board member, to testify on its behalf.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 8 of 28 PageID# 3542\nthat Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars discrimination not only based on a person's\ngender, but also based on whether the person conforms to stereotypes associated with the person's\ngender.^  This Court joined the District of Maryland in concluding that under Title DC\n\"discrimination on the basis of transgender status constitutes gender stereotyping because *by\ndefinition, transgender persons do not conform to gender stereotypes.'\" M.A.B. v. Bd ofEduc. of\nTalbot Cty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704, 714( D. Md. 2018)( quoting Finkle v. Howard Cty., 12 F. Supp.\n3d 780, 787-88( D. Md. 2014)).^\nThis Court also held that state action that discriminates against transgender individuals is\nsubject to intermediate scrutiny under the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause for two reasons.\nBCF No. 148 at 25-28. First, transgender individuals constitute at least a quasi-suspect class. See\nM.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 718-20. Second, discrimination based on sex stereotypes constitutes a\nsex-based classification of a type subject to intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 718-19.\nOn February 15, 2019, this Court permitted Mr. Grimm to file a Second Amended\nComplaint. This filing added a claim that the Board continues to discriminate against Mr. Grimm\nin violation of Title DC and the Equal Protection Clause by refusing to update his official school\ntranscripts to reflect his sex as male. ECF No. 177.\n^ Courts may, and frequently do, look to case law interpreting Title VII for guidance in evaluating a claim brought\nunder Title IX. See, e.g., G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. (\"Gr/'/w/w /\"), 822 F.3d 709, 718 (4th Cir.\n2016), vacated and remanded, 853 F.3d 729( Apr. 17, 2017)( citing Jennings v. Univ. ofN.C.y 482 F.3d 686,695 (4th\nCir. 2007)).\nThe First, Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have all relied on Price Waterhouse in holding that claims of\ndiscrimination based on transgender status constitute per se sex discrimination under Title VII or other civil rights\nlaws. See EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560,574-75 (6th Cir. 2018) cert, granted 139\nS. Ct. 1599 (2019)( Title VII); Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316-19 (11th Cir. 2011)( Title VH and Equal\nProtection Clause); Smith v. City ofS alem, 378 F.3d 566, 513-15 (6th Cir. 2004)( Title VII and Equal Protection\nClause); Rosa v. Park fV. Bank & Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215-16 (1st Cir. 2000)( Equal Credit Opportunity Act);\nSchwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201-03 (9th Cir. 2000)( Gender Motivated Violence Act).\n8\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 9 of 28 PageID# 3543\nThe parties filed motions for summary judgment. ECFNos. 184,191. The Board has also\nmoved to strike certain exhibits relied upon by Mr. Grimm. ECF No. 213. On July 23,2019, this\nCourt heard argument on these pending motions. ECF No. 228. The motions are now ripe for\nconsideration.\nIII.  LEGAL STANDARDS\nRule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a party to move for summary\njudgment and directs a court to grant such motion \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). The party \"seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of\ninforming the [court] of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)( quotations omitted). Subsequently, the burden shifts to the\nnon-moving party to present specific facts demonstrating that a genuine dispute of material fact\nexists for trial. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)\n(\"When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"). For the evidence to\npresent a \"genuine\" dispute of material fact, it must be \"such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\nWhen deciding a motion for summary judgment, courts must view the facts, and inferences to be\ndrawn from the facts, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 255.\n[A] party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the\nassertion by: (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including\ndepositions,  documents,  electronically  stored  information,  affidavits  or\ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only),\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 10 of 28 PageID# 3544\nadmissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the\nmaterials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that\nan adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\nWhen ruling on a summary judgment motion, \"a court may also give credence to other\nfacts supporting the movant, regardless of their source, if such facts are not challenged by the non-\nmoving party because a failure to challenge proffered facts may render such facts 'admitted.'\"\nXVP Sports, LLC v. Bangs, No. 2:1 lcv379,2012 WL 4329258, at *4( E.D. Va. Sept. 17, 2012).\nAs specified in Local Civil Rule 56(B),\" the Court may assume that facts identified by the\nmoving party in its listing of [undisputed] material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is\ncontroverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion.\" E.D. Va. Loc.\nCiv. R. 56(B).\nThe applicable standards for resolving the challenges raised by the Board's Motion to\nStrike are addressed where needed below.\nIV.  ANALYSIS\nA.  Motion to Strike Exhibits\nIn his Reply in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Grimm submitted the\nfollowing records: (1) a treatment documentation letter written by Dr. Griffin on May 26, 2014;\n(2) a hormone documentation letter written by Dr. Griffin on May 26, 2014;( 3) a \"To Whom It\nMay Concern\" letter written by Dr. Griffin on July 1, 2014;( 4) a \"To Whom It May Concern\"\nletter written by Dr. Eva Abel, Psy.D.;( 5) treatment records prepared by Dr. Hope Sherie, M.D.\nFACS;( 6) a \"To Whom It May Concern\" letter written by Dr. Sherie on June 21, 2016; and (7)\ntreatment records from VCU Medical Center.\n10\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 11 of 28 PageID# 3545\nThe Board has filed a Motion to Strike Exhibits submitted by Mr. Grimm in support of his\nMotion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 213. The Board seeks to strike four categories of\nexhibits:( 1) the medical records kept by Dr. Penn, Dr. Griffin, and Dr. Sherie that are referred to\nabove;( 2)t he \"To Whom It May Concern\" letters;( 3) policy statements and amicus briefs relied\nupon by Mr. Grimm; and (4)r eferences to a public hearing that was held in February 2019. These\nchallenges are addressed in turn.\n1.  Medical Business Records\nThe Board argues that Mr. Grimm's submission of medical records from Dr. Penn, Dr.\nGriffin, and Dr. Sherie constitute expert testimony and that these records must be stricken because\nMr. Grimm did not disclose these experts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 26 provides that a party must disclose, without awaiting a discovery request,\nany witness it may use to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705\ngoverning expert testimony. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A). When a party does not comply with\nRule 26(a), \"the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a\nmotion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 37.\nMr. Grimm is not presenting these exhibits as expert opinion testimony and they are not\ngovemed by Rules 702, 703, or 705. Mr. Grimm has established that he is using these records\nonly to demonstrate the fact that Mr. Grimm was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and received\ntreatment pursuant to that diagnosis. ECF No. 216 at 1-6. The Court is not asked to determine\nwhether that diagnosis was medically sound. Nor is the Court asked to determine whether it was\nmedically necessary for Mr. Grimm to use the restrooms consistent with his gender identity. Mr.\nGrimm does not seek such a ruling and reiterated this at oral argument. Draft Tr. at 11-12.\n11\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 12 of 28 PageID# 3546\nTo support its request to strike, the Board cited cases that excluded documents that differ\nfrom the evidence submitted in this case. See ECF No. 214 at 6-7. In these decisions, the courts\nexcluded expert reports that were not timely disclosed. See, e.g., United States ex rel Lutz, et al.\nV. Berkeley Heartlab, Inc., et al. No. 9:11-CV-1593-RMG,2 017 WL 5957738, at *1 (D.S.C. Dec.\n1,2017)( excluding expert reports opining that certain laboratory tests were medically necessary).\nBy contrast, Mr. Grimm has submitted documents prepared contemporaneously to his\ntreatment that detail the factual background attendant to his diagnosis and treatment.  These\ndocuments are permissible. Morris v. Bland, 666 F. App'x 233,239 (4th Cir. 2016)( holding that\nphysicians testifying as fact witnesses may \"discuss their examination of [a patient] and their\ndiagnoses or findings,\" but may not offer expert opinions as to proximate cause).\nThese records also qualify as hearsay exceptions as defined in Federal Rule of Evidence\n803(6). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), records of an act, event, condition, opinion, or\ndiagnosis are excluded from the bar against hearsay if:\n(A) the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted\nby-someone with knowledge;\n(B)t he record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business,\norganization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;\n(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another\nqualified witness, or by a certification that complies with [certain rules or statutes];\nand\n(E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or\ncircumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\nFed. R. Evid. 803(6).\n12\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 13 of 28 PageID# 3547\nMedical records are quintessentially business records, and Mr. Grimm has identified\nadequate custodians for each record presented. For these reasons, the Court denies the Board's\nMotion to Strike Mr. Grimm's medical documentation.\n2.  \"To Whom It May Concern\" Letters\nThe Board also seeks to strike the \"To Whom It May Concern\" letters on the basis of\nhearsay. The Board asserts that such letters \"are not the type ofr ecords regularly kept in the course\nof a medical practice . . . .\" ECF No. 214 at 7-8. The Board also argues that the letters are\nuntrustworthy because they are addressed to unknown recipients. Id, at 8.\nThe Board offers no support for its assertion that these letters are not the type of records\nkept regularly in the course of the medical practice. The fact that three different doctors prepared\nthese types of letters contemporaneously with their treatment of Mr. Grimm suggests otherwise.^\nRegarding trustworthiness. Rule 803(6) makes clear that the burden of showing\nuntrustworthiness falls on the opponent of the records. The Board cites Garrett v. City of Tupelo,\nNo. l:16-cv-197, 2018 WL 2994808 (N.D. Miss. June 14, 2018)t o assert that letters addressed to\nunknown recipients are untrustworthy.  However, Garrett did not turn on the identity of the\nrecipient of information, but instead turned on the identity of the source of such information. Id.\nat *4( recognizing that documents may be untrustworthy when information comes from the patient,\nnot the doctor, or when the ''source oft he information is unknown\")( emphasis added). The Board\nhas not met its burden ofs howing that these documents are untrustworthy. Accordingly, the Court\ndeclines to strike the \"To Whom It May Concern\" letters provided by Dr. Griffin, Dr. Abel, and\nDr. Sherie.\n^ The Court also notes that the World Professional Association for Transgender Health acknowledges that the role of\na health professional working with transgender youth encompasses providing referral letters for hormone therapy and\nincludes advocacy on behalf of their patients at school. WPATH Standards of Care at 13, 31-32, ECF No. 192-5.\n13\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 14 of 28 PageID# 3548\n3.  Policy Statements and Amicus Briefs\nThe Board seeks to strike evidence submitted by Mr. Grimm that include: (1) the World\nProfessional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care, (2) amicus briefs from a\nvariety of organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Parent\nTeacher Association, and school administrators from thirty-three states and the District of\nColumbia; and (3) other documents reflecting the views of the American Psychological\nAssociation and National Association of School Psychologists, Gender Spectrum, and the National\nAssociation of Secondary School Principals. See ECF No. 214 at 9-13.\nThe Board does not dispute that the statements presented in these documents reflect the\nviews of these organizations.  Instead, the Board argues that Mr. Grimm cannot use these\ndocuments to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Mr. Grimm responds that he is using these\ndocuments only as evidence oft hese organizations' views. Given that there is no dispute regarding\nthe propriety of the intended use of these documents, the Court need not strike them. The Court\nhas considered these documents as evidence of the views of the organizations that prepared them,\nand not as substantive evidence of the accuracy of such views.\n4.  Public Hearing References\nOn February 19, 2019, the Board announced that it was considering a new policy that\nwould allow transgender students to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity if certain\ncriteria were met. Feb. 3,2019 Press Release, ECF No. 192-35. The proposed policy arose out of\nsettlement negotiations between the parties. Shayna Medley-Warsoff Decl. ^ 53, ECF No. 192.\nThe policy was ultimately rejected.\nThe Board argues that the Court should strike any evidence related to the February 2019\nhearing under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which prohibits the use of evidence related to\n14\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 15 of 28 PageID# 3549\ncompromise negotiations. At the summary judgment hearing, counsel for Mr. Grimm stated that\nthe Court need not consider the statements made at the February 2019 hearing. Draft Tr. at 11.\nAccordingly, the Court has not considered evidence related to that hearing and GRANTS the\nBoard's Motion to Strike any evidence related to it.\nB.  Gavin Grimm's Motion for Summary Judgment\n1.  Title IX\nTitle DC provides that no person \"shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also 34 C.F.R. § 106.31.\nTo obtain relief for claims alleging a violation of Title DC, a plaintiff must demonstrate that( 1) he\nor she was excluded from participation in an education program because of his or her sex;( 2) the\neducational institution was receiving federal financial assistance at the time of his or her exclusion;\nand (3) the improper discrimination caused the plaintiff harm. Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 718 (citing\nPreston v. Virginia ex ret. New River Cmty. Coll., 31 F.3d 203, 206 (4th Cir. 1994)). The Board\ndoes not dispute that it receives federal financial assistance. ECF No. 154 H 91. Accordingly, only\nthe first and third elements are disputed.\n(a) Gavin Grimm was excluded from participation in an education program on the\nbasis of sex.\nIn its May 22,2018 Order, this Court concluded that claims of discrimination on the basis\noft ransgender status are per se actionable under a gender stereotyping theory. ECF No. 148 at 20.\nThe Board argues that this decision was made in error and that \"the plain language of Title IX and\nits implementing regulation, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33,\" define sex as a binary term encompassing the\nphysiological distinctions between men and women. ECF No. 200 at 27-28.\n15\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 16 of 28 PageID# 3550\nThe Board presents no intervening case law that compels reconsideration of this decision.\nTo the contrary, every court to consider the issue since May 22,2018 has agreed with the analysis\nrelied upon by this Court. See Doe by & through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518,\n530 (3d Cir. 2018) (stating that a policy forcing transgender students to use separate facilities\n\"would very publicly brand all transgender students with a scarlet'T,' and they should not have to\nendure that as the price of attending their public school\"); Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd.\nofS t. Johns C/^., 318 F. Supp. 3d 1293,1325( M.D. Fla. 2018)( holding that \"the meaning of'sex'\nin Title DC includes 'gender identity' for purposes of its application to transgender students\" and\nthat the transgender student proved a Title DC violation where a school board denied him from\nusing male restrooms, causing him harm) appeal docketed^ No. 18-13592 (11th Cir. Aug. 24,\n2018); Parentsf or Privacy v. Dallas Sch. Dist. No. 2, 326 F. Supp. 3d 1075, 1106 (D. Or. 2018)\n(\"Forcing transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity would\nundoubtedly harm those students and prevent them from equally accessing educational\nopportunities and resources. Such a... District policy would punish transgender students for their\ngender noncomformity and constitute a form of sex-stereotyping.\") appeal docketed^ 18-35708\n(9th Cir. Aug. 23,2018). This Court believes that this reasoning is sound and correct and declines\nto revisit its prior holding.\nIn sum, there is no question that the Board's policy discriminates against transgender\nstudents on the basis of their gender noncomformity. Under the policy, all students except for\ntransgender students may use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Transgender\nstudents are singled out, subjected to discriminatory treatment, and excluded from spaces where\nsimilarly situated students are permitted to go.\n16\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 17 of 28 PageID# 3551\nThe Board responds that its policy treats all students equally on the basis of physiological\nor anatomical characteristics, and that these characteristics should not be considered sex\nstereotypes under Price Waterhouse. This argument is unpersuasive.\nThe Board's policy relies on the term \"biological gender.\" See BCF No. 192-21. As this\nCourt recognized previously, biological gender is not a medically accepted term. See EOF No.\n148 at 14-15 (explaining that \"sex\" refers to biological attributes such as genes, chromosomes,\ngenitalia, and secondary sex characteristics, and \"gender\" refers to the \"'internal, deeply held\nsense' of being a man or woman'\") (citing Wylie C. Hembree et al.^ Endocrine Treatment of\nGender-dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine  Society  Clinical  Practice\nGuideline, 102(11), J. Clin. Endocrinology & Metabolism 3869, 3875 (2017)). The policy's\nuse of an ambiguous term obscures the basis for excluding transgender students from restrooms\nthat they believe are appropriate and safe for them.\nMoreover, the Board has inadequately explained the physiological and anatomical\ncharacteristics it relies upon to enforce its policy.  For example, Mr. Grimm has had chest\nreconstruction surgery.  The Gloucester County Circuit Court referred to Mr. Grimm's chest\nreconstruction surgery as \"gender reassignment surgery,\" relying on that surgery in part in\ndetermining that Mr. Grimm is a male. However, this surgery is insufficient under the Board's\npolicy. At the summary judgment hearing, counsel for the Board argued that an individual must\nhave \"the primary genitals and sex characteristic of a particular gender.\" Draft Tr. at 26. \"Primary\ngenitals\" may be sufficiently clear, but \"sex characteristic\" is troublingly ambiguous. Many\naspects of biology determine a person's sex, including genitalia, and also including hormones,\ngenes, chromosomes, and other factors that comprise a person's biological makeup. The policy at\nissue uses some of these factors to define sex and ignores others. In determining the physical\n17\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 18 of 28 PageID# 3552\ncharacteristics that define male and female and the characteristics that are disregarded, the Board\nhas crafted a policy that is based on stereotypes about gender. See Brumby^ 663 F.3d at 1316( \"A\nperson is defined as transgender precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior\ntransgresses gender stereotypes. . ..  There is thus a congruence between discriminating against\ntransgender and transsexual individuals and discrimination on the basis of gender-based behavioral\nnorms.\"); City ofLA., Dep't of Water & Power v. Manhart,4 35 U.S. 702, 707( 1978)( stating that\nprotections from sex discrimination are not limited to discrimination based on \"myths and purely\nhabitual assumptions,\" but also extend to discrimination based on generalizations that are\n\"unquestionably true\").\nAdditionally, Mr. Grimm has both a valid court order and a state-issued birth certificate\nidentifying him as male. All other students with male birth certificates at Gloucester High School\nare permitted to use male restrooms. Mr. Grimm was the only student with a male birth certificate\nexcluded from the male restrooms. This constitutes discriminatory treatment by the Board.\nFurthermore, the Board has refused to update Mr. Grimm's transcripts and education\ndocuments, despite his amended birth certificate.  The Board argues that his amended birth\ncertificate does not comply with Virginia law and questions its authenticity. Such questions have\nbeen dispelled by the Declaration of Janet M. Rainey. EOF No. 195. Ms. Rainey is the State\nRegistrar and Director of the Division of Vital Records and administers Virginia's system of vital\nrecords in accordance with Virginia law. She issued Gavin Grimm an amended birth certificate\non October 27, 2016 that identifies him as male. Id. Regardless of prior concerns about the\namended birth certificate's authenticity,^ the Board's continued recalcitrance in the face of Ms.\n® It is obvious from the face of the amended birth certificate that the photocopy presented to the Board was marked\n\"void\" because it was a copy of a document printed on security paper, not because it was fabricated. See ECF No.\n184-6 (a copy of Mr. Grimm's birth certificate, stating that it the original is printed on security paper and is void\n18\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 19 of 28 PageID# 3553\nRainey's Declaration and the court order from the Gloucester County Circuit Court is egregious.\nIt is also discriminatory. Other students in the Gloucester County School system with male birth\ncertificates also have male transcripts. Undeniably, the Board discriminates against Mr. Grimm\nin violation of Title DC in refusing to afford him the same dignity.\nThe Board also argues that Mr. Grimm has not proven that his use of male restrooms was\nmedically necessary. However, the questions presented in this case do not require a finding that\nMr. Grimm's use of a male restroom was medically necessary. The Board treated Mr. Grimm\ndifferently than other students on the basis of sex and, as established below, he suffered some\nmeasure of harm from that treatment. The existence of other methods of social transition for\ntransgender individuals is, for the purposes of resolving the questions presented, irrelevant.\nThe Court concludes that the Board has discriminated against Gavin Grimm on the basis\nof his transgender status in violation of Title IX. The Court must next determine whether the\nimproper discrimination caused Mr. Grimm harm.\n(b)T he Board's policy harmed Gavin Grimm.\nIn his Declaration, Mr. Grimm described under oath feeling stigmatized and isolated by\nhaving to use separate restroom facilities. Gavin Grimm Decl.%  47. His walk to the restroom felt\nlike a\" walk ofs hame.\" Id.^  50. He avoided using the restroom as much as possible and developed\npainful urinary tract infections that distracted him from his class work.  This stress \"was\nunbearable\" and the resulting suicidal thoughts he suffered led to his hospitalization at Virginia\nCommonwealth University Medical Center Critical Care Hospital. Id. ^ 54.\nDespite this evidence, the Board contends that Mr. Grimm has suffered no harm. ECF No.\n200 at 29-30. The Board has discounted Mr. Grimm's testimony that separate restroom facilities\nwithout a watermark). In any event, given Ms. Rainey's Declaration, the Board rationalizes its continuing denial of\nMr. Grimm's amended birth certificate on specious grounds: that a photocopy was marked void.\n19\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 20 of 28 PageID# 3554\ncaused him mental distress because he has not identified an expert to testify that he suffered such\ndistress.^ Id. Similarly, the Board argues that Mr. Grimm cannot prove that he suffered from\npainful urinary tract infections because he presented no supporting medical evidence. Id.\nThe Board's argument that Mr. Grimm's testimony regarding his harm is inadequate\nbecause it is not bolstered by expert testimony is untenable.^ The Board's argument has no basis\nin law. See Adams, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1316 (relying on a transgender student's own testimony to\nconclude that the student suffered harm in the form of stigma and humiliation).\nThe Board's assertion that Mr. Grimm has suffered no harm as a result of its policy is\nstrikingly unconvincing. Mr. Grimm broke down sobbing at school because there was no restroom\nhe could access comfortably. After one breakdown, Mr. Grimm was hospitalized with suicidal\nthoughts. He avoided after-school activities such as football games. He experienced pain and\ndiscomfort as a result of avoiding restrooms while at school.^  Further expert testimony is\nunnecessary to conclude that the Board's policy harmed Mr. Grimm during his high school years.\nThere is also sufficient evidence to conclude that the Board continues to harm Mr. Grimm\nby refusing to update his school records to reflect his male identity. Whenever Mr. Grimm has to\nprovide a copy of his transcript to another entity, such as a new school or employer, he must\" show\nthem a document that negates [his] male identity and marks him different from other boys.\" Gavin\n'Th e Board \"disputes\" Mr. Grimm's statements regarding his harm suffered because the Board labels his Declaration\nas \"self-serving.\" Dismissing a party's testimony as self-serving while failing to present contradicting evidence is\nplainly insufficient to establish a genuine dispute of material fact.\n\" At the hearing, the Court read portions of Mr. Grimm's declaration into the record regarding the humiliation and\nstigma he suffered as a result of the Board's policy. The Court asked defense counsel whether that testimony could\nsupport a finding of harm, warranting at least an award of nominal damages. Counsel responded that \"I think the\nanswer is yes.... I don't think we can say there [are] no nominal damages here.\" Draff Tr. at 26.\n'Me dical documentation confirming that his discomfort was caused by urinary tract infections is irrelevant for the\npurposes presented here. There is sufficient evidence that Mr. Grimm suffered pain of some measure, for which he\nrequests only injunctive relief and nominal damages.\n20\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 21 of 28 PageID# 3555\nGrimm Decl. T| 69. The Board continues to harm Mr. Grimm every time he is asked to furnish his\nrecords. This harm compels at least an award of injunctive relief and nominal damages.\nMr. Grimm has established (1)t hat he was excluded from the restrooms at Gloucester High\nSchool on the basis of gender stereotypes;( 2)t he educational institution received federal financial\nassistance at the time of his exclusion; and (3) improper discrimination caused him harm. For\nthese reasons, summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of Mr. Grimm regarding his claim\nasserting a violation of Title IX (Count Two).\n2.  Equal Protection Clause\nMr. Grimm also alleges that the Board's actions violated the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that \"[n]o State shall\n... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection oft he laws.\" U.S. Const, amend.\nXrV § 1. The Equal Protection Clause \"is essentially a directive that all persons similarly situated\nshould be treated alike.\" Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. I Bd. ofE duc.,\n858 F.3d 1034, 1050( 7th Cir. 2017)( quoting City ofC lehurne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S.\n432,439(1985)).\nIn its May 22, 2018 ruling, this Court held that intermediate scrutiny must be applied in\nanalyzing claims of discrimination against transgender individuals. ECF No. 148 at 24. Although\nthe Board seeks reconsideration of this holding, it presents no authorities that compel a different\nresult.'® Other courts that have considered this issue since May 2018 have agreed that heightened\nscrutiny applies. See, e.g., Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200-02 (9th Cir. 2019)( holding\nthat intermediate scrutiny applies to alleged discrimination against transgender individuals in the\nInstead, the Board's citations include out-of-circuit cases from the 1980s and 1990s, cases that interpret Title VII\ninstead of the Equal Protection Clause, and cases that pertain to sexual orientation, not gender identity. The Board's\ncitations are unpersuasive.\n21\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 22 of 28 PageID# 3556\nmilitary); Adams by & through Kasper^ 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1296, 1312-13 (applying intermediate\nscrutiny and noting that\" federal courts around the country have recognized the right oft ransgender\nstudents to use the bathroom matching their gender identity\"). In light of these rulings, this Court\nrejects defense counsel's argument that it is \"step[ping] out on its own.\" See ECF No. 200 at 32.\nWhen applying intermediate scrutiny to a sex-based classification, the Board bears the\nburden of demonstrating that its proffered justification for its use of the classification is\n\"exceedingly persuasive.\"  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). The Board is\nrequired to demonstrate that the classification \"serves important governmental objectives and that\nthe discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those\nobjectives.\" Id. at 524.\nIn response, the Board asserts an interest in protecting the privacy rights of students,\nspecifically privacy interests that students have in protecting their unclothed bodies.'' ECF No.\n200 at 33. There is little doubt that students have a privacy right in avoiding exposure of their\nunclothed bodies.\nDefendant makes no showing, however,t hat the challenged policy is \"substantially related\"\nto protecting student privacy.  First, it is undisputed that the Board received no complaints\nregarding any encounter with Mr. Grimm in a restroom. Andersen Dep. 13:20-14:5. The fact that\nMr. Grimm used male restrooms for seven weeks without incident is evidence suggesting that the\nBoard's privacy concerns are unwarranted. Cf. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052( noting that the school\ndistrict's privacy argument was undermined by the fact that a transgender boy used male restrooms\nfor six months without incident).\n'' The Board cites a case involving strip searches of students. See ECF No. 200 at 33 (citing Doe v. Renfrew, 631\nF.2d 91, 92-93 (7th Cir. 1980)). Those situations are starkly distinct from transgender students seeking to use a\nrestroom,\n22\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 23 of 28 PageID# 3557\nThe Board's privacy argument also ignores the practical realities of how transgender\nindividuals use a restroom. See Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 723 n.1 0 (expressing doubt that \"G.G.'s use\n... or for that matter any individual's appropriate use of a restroom\" would involve the types of\nintrusions present in other cases where privacy abuses were found); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052\n(holding that a similar policy \"ignores the practical reality of how [the plaintiff], as a transgender\nboy, uses the bathroom: by entering a stall and closing the door\"); Adams,3 18 F. Supp. 3d at 1296,\n1314 (\"When he goes into a restroom, [the transgender student] enters a stall, closes the door,\nrelieves himself, comes out of the stall, washes his hands, and leaves.\").\nAt the summary judgment hearing, defense counsel conceded that there is no privacy\nconcem for other students when a transgender student walks into a stall and shuts the door. Draft\nTr. at 38. However, the Board's 30(b)(6) witness, Troy Andersen, testified that privacy concems\nare implicated when students use the urinal, use the toilet, or open their pants to tuck in their shirts.\nAndersen Dep. 30:10-20. When asked why the expanded stalls and urinal dividers could not fully\naddress those situations, Mr. Andersen responded that he \"was sure\" the policy also protected\nprivacy interests in other ways, but that he \"[couldn't] think of any other off the top of[ his] head.\"\nId. This Court is compelled to conclude that the Board's privacy argument \"is based upon sheer\nconjecture and abstraction.\" See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052.\nEven if there were a plausible risk of exposure to nudity, transgender individuals often\nundergo a variety of procedures and treatments that result in anatomical and physiological changes,\nsuch as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Such treatments can result in transgender girls\ndeveloping breasts or transgender boys developing facial hair. If exposure to nudity were a real\nconcem, forcing such a transgender girl to use the male restrooms could likely expose boys to\n23\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 24 of 28 PageID# 3558\nviewing physical characteristics of the opposite sex. From this perspective, the Board's privacy\nconcerns fail to support the policy it implemented.\nWhen asked why transgender students present a greater risk of invasion of privacy to\nstudents than the risk from someone of the same physiological sex, Mr. Andersen answered \"I\nwould say that it just goes back to [bathroom] use relying on the social norms of binary sexes.\"\nAndersen Dep. 31:4-10. However,\" mere negative attitudes, or fear, unsubstantiated by factors\nwhich are properly cognizable ... are not permissible bases\" for discrimination. Cleburne Living\nCtr., 473 U.S. at 448. The Board has failed to meet its burden to provide an \"exceedingly\npersuasive justification\" for its policy. Accordingly, its policy must be found unconstitutional\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nMoreover, the Board's continued refusal to update Mr. Grimm's school records implicates\nno privacy concerns. The Board has put forward no justification for refusing to correct these\nrecords other than alleged concerns about his amended birth certificate's compliance with law and\nauthenticity. These unsubstantiated doubts are easily dispelled by Janet Rainey's Declaration.\nFor these reasons, summary judgment must be GRANTED in favor of Gavin Grimm on\nhis claim for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause (Count One).\n3.  Mr. Grimm's request for a permanent injunction\nMr. Grimm seeks an injunction requiring the Board to update his school records to reflect\nhis male identity. To obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must show:\" (1)i rreparable injury,\n(2) remedies at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury, (3) the balance of hardships\nbetween the plaintiff and defendant warrants a remedy, and (4) an injunction would not disserve\nthe public interest.\" Raub v. Campbell^ 785 F.3d 876, 885 (4th Cir. 2015)( internal quotations\n24\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 25 of 28 PageID# 3559\nomitted).  \"[T]he deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes irreparable\ninjury.\" Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002( 9th Cir. 2012)( internal quotations omitted).\nThe Court has already determined that Mr. Grimm has suffered injury that is ongoing and\nthus cannot be compensated by mere monetary damages. The balance of hardships also weighs in\nMr. Grimm's favor. The Board has not identified any difficulty in altering Mr. Grimm's records.\nNor has it identified any other governmental interest in refusing to update Mr. Grimm's records\nother than those already addressed in this Order. By contrast, Mr. Grimm suffers great hardship\nwhen he presents school records that negate his male identity. Finally, an injunction would serve\nthe public's interest in upholding constitutional rights. See Centro Tepeyac v. Montgomery Cty.,\n722 F.3d 184, 191 (4th Cir. 2013)( en banc) (internal quotations omitted). For these reasons, a\npermanent injunction requiring the Board to update Mr. Grimm's school records is warranted.\nC.  Gloucester County School Board's Motion for Summary Judgment\nThe Board also moves for summary judgment. ECF No. 195. The Board first argues that\nTitle DCs prohibition of discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" does not encompass the Board's\npolicy and that the definition of sex in the statute and its implementing regulation do not account\nfor gender identity. ECF No. 196 at 10-30. The Court rejected this argument on May 22, 2018\nand it reaffirms that holding today.\nRegarding the Equal Protection Clause, the Board argues that its policy should not be\nsubjected to heightened scrutiny but should be subjected to a lower level of scrutiny: rational basis\nreview.'^ Id. at 32-37. The Board argues that its policy survives such review. Id. The Court\nMuch oft he Board's Summary Judgment Motion is an attempt to relitigate this Court's prior holdings. For example,\nthe Board argues that if\" sex\" were equated with \"gender identity,\" Title IX and its regulations would be invalid for\nlack ofc lear notice. ECF No. \\96 2X29-30{ cximgPennhurst State Sch. &Hosp. v. Halderman,A5\\  U.S. 1,17(1981)).\nThis Court found this exact argument \"unavailing.\" ECF No. 148 at 20 n.1 1.\nUnder rational basis review, a court analyzes whether a law is \"rationally related to a legitimate governmental\ninterest.\" U.S. Dep't. ofAgric. v. Moreno,4 13 U.S. 528, 533 (1973).\n25\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 26 of 28 PageID# 3560\nagain rejects this argument. The Board also reasserts that its policy survives intermediate scrutiny\nfor the same reasons advanced in opposition to Mr. Grimm's Motion for Summary Judgment, as\naddressed above.  Those arguments remain unavailing.  Accordingly, the Gloucester County\nSchool Board's Motion for Summary Judgment, EOF No. 195, is DENIED.\nV.  CONCLUSION\nParents, teachers and administrators share \"a solemn obligation to guard the well-being of\nthe children in their charge.\" Adams, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1296.\nAs recent events from around the country have tragically demonstrated, this\nis a very challenging job. Recognizing the difficulty oft his task and that local\nschool boards, answerable to the citizens oft heir community, are best situated\nto set school policy, federal courts are reluctant to interfere. Nevertheless,\nthe federal court also has a solemn obligation: to uphold the Constitution and\nlaws oft he United States. That is why federal courts around the country have\nrecognized the right of transgender students to use the bathroom matching\ntheir gender identity.\nId.\nNelson Mandela said that \"[hjistory will judge us by the difference we make in the\neveryday lives of children.\"  One need only trace the arduous journey that this litigation has\nfollowed since its inception over four years ago to understand that passion eind conviction have\ninfused the arguments and appeals along the way.'\"*  The Board undertook the unenviable\nA cursory collection of salient events docketed in this matter include the following: the initial Complaint, June 11,\n2015; a Motion to Dismiss Complaint argued, July 27, 2015, and partially granted; Order denying Plaintiffs Motion\nfor Preliminary Injunction, September 4, 2015; Order denying an injunction appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit, September 8,2015; the Memorandum Opinion granting dismissal and denying motion\nfor injunction, September 17, 2015; the Fourth Circuit's partial reversal of dismissal Order, April 19, 2016; the Order\npermitting Plaintiffs use of male restrooms at Gloucester County High School, June 23, 2016; Defendant's appeal of\nthe June 23, 2016 Order, June 27, 2016; the Order denying a stay pending appeal, July 6, 2016; the United States\nSupreme Court's stay of the injunction pending resolution of an anticipated petition for writ of certiorari, August 3,\n2016; the Fourth Circuit vacating the preliminary injunction, April 7, 2017; reassignment of the case to the\nundersigned, June 6, 2017; an Amended Complaint, August 22, 2017; a Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint,\nSeptember 22, 2017; supplemental briefing ordered, October 26, 2017; an Amended Motion to Dismiss, January 5,\n2018; an Order denying the Amended Motion to Dismiss, May 22, 2018; Order granting a Motion for Leave to take\nInterlocutory Appeal, June 5, 2018; a Second Amended Complaint, February 15, 2019; cross-motions for summary\njudgment, March 26,2019; Defendant's Motion to Exclude and Strike Exhibits, April 30,2019; and oral argument on\ncross-motions for summary judgment and on the Motion to Strike, July 23, 2019.\n26\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-RJK   Document 229   Filed 08/09/19   Page 27 of 28 PageID# 3561\nresponsibility of trying to honor expressions of concern advanced by its constituency as it\nnavigated the challenges presented by issues that barely could have been imagined or anticipated\na generation ago. This Court acknowledges the many expressions of concem arising from genuine\nlove for our children and the fierce instinct to protect and raise our children safely in a society that\nis growing ever more complex. There can be no doubt that all involved in this case have the best\ninterests of the students at heart.\nAt the same time, the Court acknowledges that for seven weeks, the student body at\nGloucester High School accommodated Mr. Grimm without incident as he—^assisted by\ncompassionate school and medical representatives—^took new paths in his everyday life.  This\nCourt is compelled to acknowledge too that some of the external challenges seeking to reroute\nthese new paths inflicted grief, pain, and suicidal thoughts on a child.\nHowever well-intentioned some external challenges may have been and however sincere\nworries were about possible unknown consequences arising from a new school restroom protocol,\nthe perpetuation of harm to a child stemming from unconstitutional conduct cannot be allowed to\nstand. These acknowledgements are made in the hopes of making a positive difference to Mr.\nGrimm and to the everyday lives of our children who rely upon us to protect them compassionately\nand in ways that more perfectly respect the dignity of every person.\nTherefore, the Board's Motion to Strike, ECF No. 213, is GRANTED IN PART and\nDENIED IN PART.  Gavin Grimm's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 184, is\nGRANTED. The Board's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 191, is DENIED.\n\"When confronted with something affecting our children that is new, outside of our experience, and contrary to\ngender norms we thought we understood, it is natural that parents want to protect their children.

After G.G. began to use the boys’ restrooms \nwith the approval of the school administration, the local school \nboard  passed  a  policy  banning  G.G.  from  the  boys’  restroom.  \nG.G.  alleges  that  the  school  board  impermissibly  discriminated \nagainst him in violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection \nClause of the Constitution.  The district court dismissed G.G.’s \nTitle  IX  claim  and  denied  his  request  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction.    This  appeal  followed.    Because  we  conclude  the \ndistrict  court  did  not  accord  appropriate  deference  to  the \nrelevant  Department  of  Education  regulations,  we  reverse  its \ndismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.  Because we conclude that \nthe  district  court  used  the  wrong  evidentiary  standard  in \nassessing G.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunction, we vacate \nits  denial  and  remand  for  consideration  under  the  correct \nstandard.    We  therefore  reverse  in  part,  vacate  in  part,  and \nremand  the  case  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this \nopinion. \n \nI. \nAt the heart of this appeal is whether Title IX requires \nschools  to  provide  transgender  students  access  to  restrooms \ncongruent with their gender identity.  Title IX provides: “[n]o \n5 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 6 of 69 PageID# 764\nperson  .  .  .  shall,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving \nFederal  financial  assistance.”    20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a).    The \nDepartment  of  Education’s  (the  Department)  regulations \nimplementing Title IX permit the provision of “separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such \nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable \nto such facilities for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § \n106.33.    In  an  opinion  letter  dated  January  7,  2015,  the \nDepartment’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) interpreted how this \nregulation  should  apply  to  transgender  individuals:  “When  a \nschool elects to separate or treat students differently on the \nbasis  of  sex  .  .  .  a  school  generally  must  treat  transgender \nstudents  consistent  with  their  gender  identity.”    J.A.  55.  \nBecause  this  case  comes  to  us  after  dismissal  pursuant  to \nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6),  the  facts  below  are \ngenerally as stated in G.G.’s complaint.   \n \nA. \nG.G.  is  a  transgender  boy  now  in  his  junior  year  at \nGloucester High School.  G.G.’s birth-assigned sex, or so-called \n“biological sex,” is female, but G.G.’s gender identity is male.  \nG.G.  has  been  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria,  a  medical \n6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 7 of 69 PageID# 765\ncondition  characterized  by  clinically  significant  distress \ncaused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and \nthe person’s birth-assigned sex.  Since the end of his freshman \nyear, G.G. has undergone hormone therapy and has legally changed \nhis  name  to  G.,  a  traditionally  male  name.    G.G.  lives  all \naspects of his life as a boy.  G.G. has not, however, had sex \nreassignment surgery.1 \n  Before  beginning  his  sophomore  year,  G.G.  and  his  mother \ntold  school  officials  that  G.G.  was  a  transgender  boy.    The \nofficials were supportive and took steps to ensure that he would \nbe treated as a  boy by teachers  and  staff.   Later,  at  G.G.’s \nrequest,  school  officials  allowed  G.G.  to  use  the  boys’ \nrestroom.2  G.G. used this restroom without incident for about \nseven weeks.  G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom, however, excited \nthe interest of others in the community, some of whom contacted \n                     \n1 The World Professional Association for Transgender Health \n(WPATH) has established Standards of Care for individuals with \ngender  dysphoria.    J.A.  37.    These  Standards  of  Care  are \naccepted as authoritative by organizations such as the American \nMedical Association and the American Psychological Association.  \nId.  The WPATH Standards of Care do not permit sex reassignment \nsurgery  for  persons  who  are  under  the  legal  age  of  majority.  \nJ.A. 38. \n \n2  G.G.  does  not  participate  in  the  school’s  physical \neducation programs. He does not seek here, and never has sought, \nuse of the boys’ locker room.  Only restroom use is at issue in \nthis case. \n7 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 8 of 69 PageID# 766\nthe  Gloucester  County  School  Board  (the  Board)  seeking  to  bar \nG.G. from continuing to use the boys’ restroom.  \nBoard  Member  Carla  B.  Hook  (Hook)  added  an  item  to  the \nagenda  for  the  November  11,  2014  board  meeting  titled \n“Discussion of Use of Restrooms/Locker Room Facilities.”  J.A. \n15.    Hook  proposed  the  following  resolution  (hereinafter  the \n“transgender restroom policy” or “the policy”): \nWhereas  the  GCPS  [i.e.,  Gloucester  County \nPublic  Schools]  recognizes  that  some \nstudents  question  their  gender  identities, \nand \n \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to \nseek  support,  advice,  and  guidance  from \nparents,  professionals  and  other  trusted \nadults, and \n \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect  the  privacy  of  all  students, \ntherefore \n \nIt  shall  be  the  practice  of  the  GCPS  to \nprovide male and female restroom and locker \nroom facilities in its schools, and the use \nof  said  facilities  shall  be  limited  to  the \ncorresponding  biological  genders,  and \nstudents  with  gender  identity  issues  shall \nbe  provided  an  alternative  appropriate \nprivate facility. \n \nJ.A. 15-16; 58.   \nAt the November 11, 2014 meeting twenty-seven people spoke \nduring  the  Citizens’  Comment  Period,  a  majority  of  whom \nsupported  Hook’s  proposed  resolution.    Many  of  the  speakers \ndisplayed hostility to G.G., including by referring pointedly to \n8 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 9 of 69 PageID# 767\nhim as a “young lady.”  J.A. 16.  Others claimed that permitting \nG.G.  to  use  the  boys’  restroom  would  violate  the  privacy  of \nother  students  and  would  lead  to  sexual  assault  in  restrooms.  \nOne  commenter  suggested  that  if  the  proposed  policy  were  not \nadopted,  non-transgender  boys  would  come  to  school  wearing \ndresses in order to gain access to the girls’ restrooms.  G.G. \nand his parents spoke against the proposed policy.  Ultimately, \nthe Board postponed a vote on the policy until its next meeting \non December 9, 2014. \n  At  the  December  9  meeting,  approximately  thirty-seven \npeople spoke during the Citizens’ Comment Period.  Again, most \nof  those  who  spoke  were  in  favor  of  the  proposed  resolution.  \nSome speakers threatened to vote the Board members out of office \nif  the  Board  members  voted  against  the  proposed  policy.  \nSpeakers  again  referred  to  G.G.  as  a  “girl”  or  “young  lady.”  \nJ.A. 18.  One speaker called G.G. a “freak” and compared him to \na person who thinks he is a “dog” and wants to urinate on fire \nhydrants.  Id.  Following this second comment period, the Board \nvoted  6-1  to  adopt  the  proposed  policy,  thereby  barring  G.G. \nfrom using the boys’ restroom at school. \n  G.G. alleges that he cannot use the girls’ restroom because \nwomen and girls in those facilities “react[] negatively because \nthey  perceive[]  G.G.  to  be  a  boy.”    Id.    Further,  using  the \ngirls’  restroom would  “cause  severe  psychological  distress”  to \n9 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 10 of 69 PageID# 768\nG.G.  and  would  be  incompatible  with  his  treatment  for  gender \ndysphoria.  J.A. 19.  As a corollary to the policy, the Board \nannounced  a  series  of  updates  to  the  school’s  restrooms  to \nimprove  general  privacy  for  all  students,  including  adding  or \nexpanding  partitions  between  urinals  in  male  restrooms,  adding \nprivacy  strips  to  the  doors  of  stalls  in  all  restrooms,  and \nconstructing  single-stall  unisex  restrooms  available  to  all \nstudents.    G.G.  alleges  that  he  cannot  use  these  new  unisex \nrestrooms because they “make him feel even more stigmatized . . \n. .  Being required to use the separate restrooms sets him apart \nfrom his peers, and serves as a daily reminder that the school \nviews  him  as  ‘different.’”    Id.    G.G.  further  alleges  that, \nbecause of this stigma and exclusion, his social transition is \nundermined  and  he  experiences  “severe  and  persistent  emotional \nand social harms.”  Id.  G.G. avoids using the restroom while at \nschool  and  has,  as  a  result  of  this  avoidance,  developed \nmultiple urinary tract infections.  \n \nB. \n  G.G.  sued  the  Board  on  June  11,  2015.    G.G.  seeks  an \ninjunction  allowing  him  to  use  the  boys’  restroom  and  brings \nunderlying  claims  that  the  Board  impermissibly  discriminated \nagainst him in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nAct of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  \n10 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 11 of 69 PageID# 769\nOn July 27, 2015, the district court held a hearing on G.G.’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction and on the Board’s motion to \ndismiss  G.G.’s  lawsuit.    At  the  hearing,  the  district  court \norally  dismissed  G.G.’s  Title  IX  claim  and  denied  his  request \nfor a preliminary injunction, but withheld ruling on the motion \nto  dismiss  G.G.’s  equal  protection  claim.    The  district  court \nfollowed its ruling from the bench with a written order dated \nSeptember  4,  2015  denying  the  injunction  and  a  second  written \norder dated September 17, 2015 dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim \nand expanding on its rationale for denying the injunction. \n  In  its  September  17,  2015  order,  the  district  court \nreasoned that Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of \nsex  and  not  on  the  basis  of  other  concepts  such  as  gender, \ngender  identity,  or  sexual  orientation.    The  district  court \nobserved that the regulations implementing Title IX specifically \nallow schools to provide separate restrooms on the basis of sex.  \nThe district court concluded that G.G.’s sex was female and that \nrequiring  him  to  use  the  female  restroom  facilities  did  not \nimpermissibly  discriminate  against  him  on  the  basis  of  sex  in \nviolation of Title IX.  With respect to G.G.’s request for an \ninjunction, the district court found that G.G. had not made the \nrequired showing that the balance of equities was in his favor.  \nThe district court found that requiring G.G. to use the unisex \nrestrooms  during  the  pendency  of  this  lawsuit  was  not  unduly \n11 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 12 of 69 PageID# 770\nburdensome  and  would  result  in  less  hardship  than  requiring \nother  students  made  uncomfortable  by  G.G.’s  presence  in  the \nboys’ restroom to themselves use the unisex restrooms. \n  This appeal followed.  G.G. asks us to reverse the district \ncourt’s dismissal of his Title IX claim, grant the injunction he \nseeks,  and,  because  of  comments  made  by  the  district  judge \nduring  the  motion  hearing,  to  assign  the  case  to  a  different \ndistrict judge on remand.  The Board, on the other hand, asks us \nto  affirm  the  district  court’s  rulings  and  also  asks  us  to \ndismiss  G.G.’s  equal  protection  claim—on  which  the  district \ncourt has yet to rule—as without merit.  The United States, as \n \nit did below, has filed an amicus brief supporting G.G.’s Title \nIX claim in order to defend the government’s interpretation of \nTitle  IX  as  requiring  schools  to  provide  transgender  students \naccess to restrooms congruent with their gender identity. \n \nII. \n  We turn first to the district court’s dismissal of G.G.’s \nTitle IX claim.3  We review de novo the district court’s grant of \n                     \n3 We decline the Board’s invitation to preemptively dismiss \nG.G.’s  equal  protection  claim  before  it  has  been  fully \nconsidered by the district court.  “[W]e are a court of review, \nnot of first view.”  Decker v.

Robbins,  519  U.S.  452 \n \n(1997).    Auer requires  that  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  its \nown ambiguous regulation be given controlling weight unless the \ninterpretation  is  plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation or statute.  Id. at 461.  Agency interpretations need \nnot  be  well-settled  or  long-standing  to  be  entitled  to \ndeference.  They must, however, “reflect the agency’s fair and \nconsidered judgment on the matter in question.”  Id. at 462.  An \ninterpretation may not be the result of the agency’s fair and \nconsidered  judgment,  and  will  not  be  accorded  Auer  deference, \nwhen  the  interpretation  conflicts  with  a  prior  interpretation, \nwhen  it  appears  that  the  interpretation  is  no  more  than  a \n                     \n \navailable  at  http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs \n/faqs-title-ix-single-sex-201412.pdf. \n \nThe  dissent  suggests  that  we  ignore  the  part  of  OCR’s \nopinion letter in which the agency “also encourages schools to \noffer  the  use  of  gender-neutral,  individual-user  facilities  to \nany  student  who  does  not  want  to  use  shared  sex-segregated \nfacilities,”  as  the  Board  did  here.

However, \nbecause G.G. does want to use shared sex-segregated facilities, \nthe  agency’s  suggestion  regarding  students  who  do  not  want  to \nuse such shared sex-segregated facilities is immaterial to the \nresolution  of  G.G.’s  claim.

The district \ncourt  found  the  regulation  to  be  unambiguous  because  “[i]t \nclearly allows the School Board to limit bathroom access ‘on the \nbasis  of  sex,’  including  birth  or  biological  sex.”    G.G.  v. \nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., No. 4:15cv54, 2015 WL 5560190, at *8 \n(E.D.  Va.  Sept.  17,  2015).    The  district  court  also  found, \nalternatively,  that  the  interpretation  advanced  by  the \nDepartment  was  clearly  erroneous  and  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation.  The district court reasoned that, because “on the \nbasis of  sex” means,  at most,  on the basis of  sex and gender \ntogether, it cannot mean on the basis of gender alone.  Id.   \nThe  United  States  contends  that  the  regulation  clarifies \nstatutory  ambiguity  by  making  clear  that  schools  may  provide \nseparate restrooms for boys and girls “without running afoul of \nTitle  IX.”    Br.  for  the  United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  24-25 \n(hereinafter  “U.S.  Br.”).    However,  the  Department  also \nconsiders  §  106.33  itself  to  be  ambiguous  as  to  transgender \nstudents because “the regulation is silent on what the phrases \n‘students of one sex’ and ‘students of the other sex’ mean in \nthe context of transgender students.”  Id. at 25.  The United \n17 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 18 of 69 PageID# 776\nStates  contends  that  the  interpretation  contained  in  OCR’s \nJanuary  7,  2015  letter  resolves  the  ambiguity  in  §  106.33  as \nthat regulation applies to transgender individuals. \n \nB. \nWe  will  not  accord  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  an \nunambiguous  regulation  Auer  deference.    Thus,  our  analysis \nbegins  with  a  determination  of  whether  34  C.F.R.  §  106.33 \ncontains  an  ambiguity.    Section  106.33  permits  schools  to \nprovide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of \none  sex  shall  be  comparable  to  such  facilities  provided  for \nstudents of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \n“[D]etermining whether a regulation or statute is ambiguous \npresents  a  legal  question,  which  we  determine  de  novo.”  \nHumanoids Grp. v. Rogan, 375 F.3d 301, 306 (4th Cir. 2004).  We \ndetermine ambiguity by analyzing the language under the three-\npart framework set forth in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. \n337  (1997).    The  plainness  or  ambiguity  of  language  is \ndetermined  by  reference  to  (1)  the  language  itself,    (2)  the \nspecific  context  in  which  that  language  is  used,  and  (3)  the \nbroader context of the statute or regulation as a whole.

Second, in the specific context of \n§ 106.33, the plain meaning of the regulatory language is best \nstated by the United States: “the mere act of providing separate \nrestroom facilities for males and females does not violate Title \nIX . . . .”  U.S. Br. 22 n.8.  Third, the language “of one sex” \nand “of the other sex” appears repeatedly in the broader context \nof  34  C.F.R.  §  106  Subpart  D,  titled  “Discrimination  on  the \nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited.”6  \nThis  repeated  formulation  indicates  two  sexes  (“one  sex”  and \n“the  other  sex”),  and  the  only  reasonable  reading  of  the \nlanguage used throughout the relevant regulatory section is that \nit  references  male  and  female.    Read  plainly  then,  §  106.33 \npermits  schools  to  provide  separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower  facilities  for  its  male  and  female  students.    By \n                     \n6  For  example,  §  106.32(b)(2)  provides  that  “[h]ousing \nprovided . . .  to students of one sex, when compared to that \nprovided  to  students  of  the  other  sex,  shall  be  as  a  whole: \nproportionate in quantity . . . and [c]omparable in quality and \ncost  to  the  student”;  §  106.37(a)(3)  provides  that  an \ninstitution generally cannot “[a]pply any rule . . . concerning \neligibility  [for  financial  assistance]  which  treats  persons  of \none sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to \nmarital  or  parental  status”;  and  §  106.41(b)  provides  that \n“where  [an  institution]  operates  or  sponsors  a  team  in  a \nparticular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors \nno such team for members of the other sex . . . members of the \nexcluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered . . \n. .” \n19 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 20 of 69 PageID# 778\nimplication,  the  regulation  also  permits  schools  to  exclude \nmales from the female facilities and vice-versa. \nOur inquiry is not ended, however, by this straightforward \nconclusion.  Although the regulation may refer unambiguously to \nmales  and  females,  it  is  silent  as  to  how  a  school  should \ndetermine whether a transgender individual is a male or female \nfor  the  purpose  of  access  to  sex-segregated  restrooms.    We \nconclude  that  the  regulation  is  susceptible  to  more  than  one \nplausible reading because it permits both the Board’s reading—\ndetermining maleness or femaleness with reference exclusively to \ngenitalia—and  the  Department’s  interpretation—determining \nmaleness or femaleness with reference to gender identity.  Cf. \nDickenson-Russell Coal Co. v. Sec’y of Labor, 747 F.3d 251, 258 \n(4th  Cir.  2014)  (refusing  to  afford  Auer  deference  where  the \nlanguage of the regulation at issue was “not susceptible to more \nthan  one  plausible  reading”  (citation  and  quotation  marks \nomitted)).  It is not clear to us how the regulation would apply \nin a number of situations—even under the Board’s own “biological \ngender”  formulation.    For  example,  which  restroom  would  a \ntransgender  individual  who  had  undergone  sex-reassignment \nsurgery use? What about an intersex individual?  What about an \nindividual  born  with  X-X-Y  sex  chromosomes?    What  about  an \nindividual  who  lost  external  genitalia  in  an  accident?  The \nDepartment’s interpretation resolves ambiguity by providing that \n20 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 21 of 69 PageID# 779\nin the case of a transgender individual using a sex-segregated \nfacility,  the  individual’s  sex  as  male  or  female  is  to  be \ngenerally  determined  by  reference  to  the  student’s  gender \nidentity. \n \nC. \nBecause  we  conclude  that  the  regulation  is  ambiguous  as \napplied  to  transgender  individuals,  the  Department’s \ninterpretation  is  entitled  to  Auer  deference  unless  the  Board \ndemonstrates  that  the  interpretation  is  plainly  erroneous  or \ninconsistent with the regulation or statute.

Reg. 30802, 30955 \n(May 9, 1980).  Two dictionaries from the drafting era inform \nour analysis of how the term “sex” was understood at that time.  \nThe first defines “sex” as “the character of being either male \nor  female”  or  “the  sum  of  those  anatomical  and  physiological \ndifferences  with  reference  to  which  the  male  and  female  are \ndistinguished . . . .”  American College Dictionary 1109 (1970).  \nThe second defines “sex” as: \nthe sum of the morphological, physiological, \nand  behavioral  peculiarities  of  living \nbeings  that  subserves  biparental \nreproduction  with  its  concomitant  genetic \nsegregation and recombination which underlie \nmost  evolutionary  change,  that  in  its \ntypical  dichotomous  occurrence  is  usu[ally] \ngenetically  controlled  and  associated  with \nspecial  sex  chromosomes,  and  that  is \ntypically  manifested  as  maleness  and \nfemaleness . . . . \n \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1971).   \nAlthough these definitions suggest that the word “sex” was \nunderstood  at  the  time  the  regulation  was  adopted  to  connote \nmale and female and that maleness and femaleness were determined \nprimarily by reference to the factors the district court termed \n“biological  sex,”  namely  reproductive  organs,  the  definitions \nalso suggest that a hard-and-fast binary division on the basis \nof  reproductive  organs—although  useful  in  most  cases—was  not \n22 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 23 of 69 PageID# 781\nuniversally  descriptive.7    The  dictionaries,  therefore,  used \nqualifiers  such  as  reference  to  the  “sum  of”  various  factors, \n“typical  dichotomous  occurrence,”  and  “typically  manifested  as \nmaleness  and  femaleness.”    Section  106.33  assumes  a  student \npopulation  composed  of  individuals  of  what  has  traditionally \nbeen  understood  as  the  usual  “dichotomous  occurrence”  of  male \nand female where the various indicators of sex all point in the \nsame  direction.    It  sheds  little  light  on  how  exactly  to \ndetermine the “character of being either male or female” where \nthose  indicators  diverge.    We  conclude  that  the  Department’s \ninterpretation  of  how  §  106.33  and  its  underlying  assumptions \nshould apply to transgender individuals is not plainly erroneous \nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation.  The regulation \nis  silent  as  to  which  restroom  transgender  individuals  are  to \nuse  when  a  school  elects  to  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms, \nand  the  Department’s  interpretation,  although  perhaps  not  the \nintuitive  one,  is  permitted  by  the  varying  physical, \npsychological, and social aspects—or, in the words of an older \n                     \n7 Modern definitions of “sex” also implicitly recognize the \nlimitations  of  a  nonmalleable,  binary  conception  of  sex.    For \nexample, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sex” as “[t]he sum of \nthe peculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a \nmale  from  a  female  organism;  gender.”    Black’s  Law  Dictionary \n1583 (10th ed. 2014).  The American Heritage Dictionary includes \nin the definition of “sex” “[o]ne’s identity as either female or \nmale.”  American Heritage Dictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011). \n23 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 24 of 69 PageID# 782\ndictionary,  “the  morphological,  physiological,  and  behavioral \npeculiarities”—included in the term “sex.” \n \nD. \nFinally,  we  consider  whether  the  Department’s \ninterpretation of § 106.33 is the result of the agency’s fair \nand considered judgment.  Even a valid interpretation will not \nbe  accorded  Auer  deference  where  it  conflicts  with  a  prior \ninterpretation, where it appears that the interpretation is no \nmore  than  a  convenient  litigating  position,  or  where  the \ninterpretation is a post hoc rationalization.  Christopher, 132 \nS. Ct. at 2166 (citations omitted).   \nAlthough  the  Department’s  interpretation  is  novel  because \nthere  was  no  interpretation  as  to  how  §  106.33  applied  to \ntransgender  individuals  before  January  2015,  “novelty  alone  is \nno reason to refuse deference” and does not render the current \ninterpretation  inconsistent  with  prior  agency  practice.    See \nTalk Am., Inc. v.  Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 131 S. Ct.  2254,  2263 \n(2011).  As the United States explains, the issue in this case \n“did  not  arise  until  recently,”  see  id.,  because  schools  have \nonly  recently  begun  citing  §  106.33  as  justification  for \nenacting  new  policies  restricting  transgender  students’  access \nto restroom facilities.   The Department contends that “[i]t is \nto  those  ‘newfound’  policies  that  [the  Department’s] \n24 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 25 of 69 PageID# 783\ninterpretation of the regulation responds.”  U.S. Br. 29.  We \nsee no reason to doubt this explanation.  See Talk Am., Inc., \n131 S. Ct. at 2264. \nNor  is  the  interpretation  merely  a  convenient  litigating \nposition.    The  Department  has  consistently  enforced  this \nposition since 2014.  See J.A. 55 n.5 & n.6 (providing examples \nof OCR enforcement actions to secure transgender students access \nto restrooms congruent with their gender identities).  Finally, \nthis  interpretation  cannot  properly  be  considered  a  post  hoc \nrationalization  because  it  is  in  line  with  the  existing \nguidances and regulations of a number of federal agencies—all of \nwhich  provide  that  transgender  individuals  should  be  permitted \naccess  to  the  restroom  that  corresponds  with  their  gender \nidentities.8  U.S. Br. 17 n.5 & n.6 (citing publications by the \nOccupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  the  Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Housing and \n                     \n8 We disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that the result \nwe  reach  today  renders  the  enforcement  of  separate  restroom \nfacilities  impossible  because  it  “would  require  schools  to \nassume  gender  identity  based  on  appearances,  social \nexpectations,  or  explicit  declarations  of  identity.”    Post  at \n65.    Accepting  the  Board’s  position  would  equally  require  the \nschool to assume “biological sex” based on “appearances, social \nexpectations,  or  explicit  declarations  of  [biological  sex].”  \nCertainly,  no  one  is  suggesting  mandatory  verification  of  the \n“correct”  genitalia  before  admittance  to  a  restroom.    The \nDepartment’s  vision  of  sex-segregated  restrooms  which  takes \naccount of gender identity presents no greater “impossibility of \nenforcement”  problem  than  does the  Board’s  “biological  gender” \nvision of sex-segregated restrooms. \n25 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 26 of 69 PageID# 784\nUrban  Development,  and  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management).  \nNone of the Christopher grounds for withholding Auer deference \nare present in this case. \n \nE. \nWe conclude that the Department’s interpretation of its own \nregulation,  §  106.33,  as  it  relates  to  restroom  access  by \ntransgender individuals, is entitled to Auer deference and is to \nbe  accorded  controlling  weight  in  this  case.9    We  reverse  the \ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion and its resultant dismissal \nof G.G.’s Title IX claim. \n \nF. \n  In many respects, we are in agreement with the dissent.  We \nagree that “sex” should be construed uniformly throughout Title \nIX  and  its  implementing  regulations.    We  agree  that  it  has \nindeed been commonplace and widely accepted to separate public \n                     \n9  The  Board  urges  us  to  reach  a  contrary  conclusion \nregarding  the  validity  of  the  Department’s  interpretation, \nciting Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher \nEduc., 97 F. Supp. 657 (W.D. Pa. 2015).  Although we recognize \nthat  the  Johnston  court  confronted  a  case  similar  in  most \nmaterial facts to the one before us, that court did not consider \nthe  Department’s  interpretation    of  §  106.33.    Because  the \nJohnston  court  did  not  grapple  with  the  questions  of \nadministrative  law  implicated  here,  we  find  the  Title  IX \nanalysis in Johnston to be unpersuasive. \n \n26 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 27 of 69 PageID# 785\nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of \nsex.    We  agree  that  “an  individual  has  a  legitimate  and \nimportant interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude \nor partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts” are \nnot involuntarily exposed.10  Post at 56.  It is not apparent to \nus, however, that the truth of these propositions undermines the \nconclusion we reach regarding the level of deference due to the \nDepartment’s interpretation of its own regulations. \n  The Supreme Court commands the use of particular analytical \nframeworks  when  courts  review  the  actions  of  the  executive \nagencies.    G.G.  claims  that  he  is  entitled  to  use  the  boys’ \nrestroom  pursuant  to  the  Department’s  interpretation  of  its \nregulations implementing Title IX.  We have carefully followed \nthe Supreme Court’s guidance in Chevron, Auer, and Christopher \nand have determined that the interpretation contained in the OCR \nletter is to be accorded controlling weight.  In a case such as \n                     \n10 We doubt that G.G.’s use of the communal restroom of his \nchoice  threatens  the  type  of  constitutional  abuses  present  in \nthe cases cited by the dissent.  For example,  G.G.’s use—or for \nthat matter any individual’s appropriate use—of a restroom will \nnot involve the type of intrusion present in Brannum v. Overton \nCty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (involving the \nvideotaping of students dressing and undressing in school locker \nrooms),  Beard  v.  Whitmore  Lake  Sch.  Dist.,  402  F.3d  598,  604 \n(6th Cir. 2005) (involving the indiscriminate strip searching of \ntwenty male and five female students), or Supelveda v. Ramirez, \n967  F.2d  1413,  1416  (9th  Cir.  1992)  (involving  a  male  parole \nofficer forcibly entering a bathroom stall with a female parolee \nto supervise the provision of a urine sample).  \n27 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 28 of 69 PageID# 786\nthis,  where  there  is  no  constitutional  challenge  to  the \nregulation  or  agency  interpretation,  the  weighing  of  privacy \ninterests or safety concerns11—fundamentally questions of policy—\nis a task committed to the agency, not to the courts. \n  The  Supreme  Court’s  admonition  in  Chevron  points  to  the \nbalance courts must strike: \nJudges are not experts in the field, and are \nnot  part  of  either  political  branch  of  the \nGovernment.  Courts  must,  in  some  cases, \nreconcile competing political interests, but \nnot  on  the  basis  of  the  judges'  personal \npolicy  preferences.  In  contrast,  an  agency \nto  which  Congress  has  delegated  policy-\nmaking  responsibilities  may,  within  the \nlimits  of  that  delegation,  properly  rely \nupon the incumbent administration's views of \nwise  policy  to  inform  its  judgments.  While \nagencies are not directly accountable to the \npeople,  the  Chief  Executive  is,  and  it  is \nentirely  appropriate  for  this  political \nbranch of the Government to make such policy \nchoices—resolving  the  competing  interests \n                     \n11 The dissent accepts the Board’s invocation of amorphous \nsafety  concerns  as  a  reason  for  refusing  deference  to  the \nDepartment’s interpretation.  We note that the record is devoid \nof  any  evidence  tending  to  show  that  G.G.’s  use  of  the  boys’ \nrestroom creates a safety issue.  We also note that the Board \nhas been, perhaps deliberately, vague as to the nature of the \nsafety  concerns  it  has—whether  it  fears  that  it  cannot  ensure \nG.G.’s  safety  while  in  the  restroom  or  whether  it  fears  G.G. \nhimself is a threat to the safety of others in the restroom.  We \nare  unconvinced  of  the  existence  of  danger  caused  by  “sexual \nresponses  prompted  by  students’  exposure  to  the  private  body \nparts  of  students  of  the  other  biological  sex.”    Post  at  58.  \nThe  same  safety  concern  would  seem  to  require  segregated \nrestrooms for gay boys and girls who would, under the dissent’s \nformulation,  present  a  safety  risk  because  of  the  “sexual \nresponses prompted” by their exposure to the private body parts \nof other students of the same sex in sex-segregated restrooms.    \n28 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 29 of 69 PageID# 787\nwhich  Congress  itself  either  inadvertently \ndid not resolve, or intentionally left to be \nresolved  by  the  agency  charged  with  the \nadministration  of  the  statute  in  light  of \neveryday realities. \n \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837,  865-66  (1984).    Not  only  may  a  subsequent  administration \nchoose to implement a different policy, but Congress may also, \nof course, revise Title IX explicitly to prohibit or authorize \nthe course charted here by the Department regarding the use of \nrestrooms  by  transgender  students.    To  the  extent  the  dissent \ncritiques the result we reach today on policy grounds, we reply \nthat, our Auer analysis complete, we leave policy formulation to \nthe political branches. \n \nIII. \n  G.G. also asks us to reverse the district court’s denial of \nthe  preliminary  injunction  he  sought  which  would  have  allowed \nhim  to  use  the  boys’  restroom  during  the  pendency  of  this \nlawsuit.  “To win such a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; \n(2)  they  will  likely  suffer  irreparable  harm  absent  an \ninjunction; (3) the balance of hardships weighs in their favor; \nand (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”  League of \nWomen Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236 (4th \n29 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 30 of 69 PageID# 788\nCir.  2014)  (citation  omitted).    We  review  a  district  court’s \ndenial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.  Id. \nat  235.    “A  district  court  has  abused  its  discretion  if  its \ndecision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a \nclearly  erroneous  factual  finding.”    Morris  v.  Wachovia  Sec., \nInc., 448 F.3d 268, 277 (4th Cir. 2006) (citation and quotations \nomitted).  “We do not ask whether we would have come to the same \nconclusion as the district court if we were examining the matter \nde  novo.”    Id.  (citation  omitted).    Instead,  “we  reverse  for \nabuse of discretion if we form a definite and firm conviction \nthat the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the \nconclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.”  \nId. (citations and quotations omitted).  \nThe  district  court  analyzed  G.G.’s  request  only  with \nreference to the third factor—the balance of hardships—and found \nthat  the  balance  of  hardships  did  not  weigh  in  G.G.’s  favor.   \nG.G. submitted two declarations in support of his complaint, one \nfrom  G.G.  himself  and  one  from  a  medical  expert,  Dr.  Randi \nEttner, to explain what harms G.G. will suffer as a result of \nhis  exclusion  from  the  boys’  restroom.  The  district  court \nrefused to consider this evidence because it was “replete with \ninadmissible evidence including thoughts of others, hearsay, and \nsuppositions.”  G.G., 2015 WL 5560190, at *11.   \n30 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 31 of 69 PageID# 789\nThe  district  court  misstated  the  evidentiary  standard \ngoverning  preliminary  injunction  hearings.    The  district  court \nstated:  “The  complaint  is  no  longer  the  deciding  factor, \nadmissible evidence is the deciding factor.  Evidence therefore \nmust conform to the rules of evidence.”  Id. at *9.  Preliminary \ninjunctions,  however,  are  governed  by  less  strict  rules  of \nevidence:   \nThe  purpose  of  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nmerely to preserve the relative positions of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can \nbe  held.    Given  this  limited  purpose,  and \ngiven  the  haste  that  is  often  necessary  if \nthose  positions  are  to  be  preserved,  a \npreliminary  injunction  is  customarily \ngranted on the basis of procedures that are \nless  formal  and  evidence  that  is  less \ncomplete than in a trial on the merits. \n \nUniv. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); see also \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 (1976)  (taking as true \nthe  “well-pleaded  allegations  of  respondents’  complaint  and \nuncontroverted affidavits filed in support of the motion for a \npreliminary injunction”); compare Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (requiring \naffidavits supporting summary judgment to be “made on personal \nknowledge, [and to] set out facts that would be admissible in \nevidence), with Fed R. Civ. P. 65 (providing no such requirement \nin  the  preliminary  injunction  context).    Thus,  although \nadmissible  evidence  may  be  more  persuasive  than  inadmissible \nevidence in the preliminary injunction context, it was error for \n31 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 32 of 69 PageID# 790\nthe district court to summarily reject G.G.’s proffered evidence \nbecause it may have been inadmissible at a subsequent trial. \nAdditionally,  the  district  court  completely  excluded  some \nof G.G.’s proffered evidence on hearsay grounds.  The seven of \nour  sister  circuits  to  have  considered  the  admissibility  of \nhearsay in preliminary injunction proceedings have decided that \nthe  nature  of  evidence  as  hearsay  goes  to  “weight,  not \npreclusion”  and  have  permitted  district  courts  to  “rely  on \nhearsay evidence for the limited purpose of determining whether \nto  award  a  preliminary  injunction.”    Mullins  v.  City  of  New \nYork, 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Kos Pharm., Inc. \nv. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 718 (3d Cir. 2004); Ty, Inc. v. \nGMA Accessories, Inc., 132 F.3d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir. 1997); Levi \nStrauss & Co. v. Sunrise Int’l Trading, Inc., 51 F.3d 982, 985 \n(11th  Cir.  1995)  (“At  the  preliminary  injunction  stage,  a \ndistrict  court  may  rely  on  affidavits  and  hearsay  materials \nwhich  would  not  be  admissible  evidence  for  a  permanent \ninjunction, if the evidence is appropriate given the character \nand  objectives  of  the  injunctive  proceeding.”  (citation  and \ninternal quotations omitted)); Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. \nFDIC, 992 F.2d 545, 551 (5th Cir. 1993) (“[A]t the preliminary \ninjunction stage, the procedures in the district court are less \nformal,  and  the  district  court  may  rely  on  otherwise \ninadmissible  evidence,  including  hearsay  evidence.”);  Asseo  v. \n32 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 33 of 69 PageID# 791\nPan Am.

We see no reason for a different rule to govern in this \nCircuit.    Because  preliminary  injunction  proceedings  are \ninformal  ones  designed  to  prevent  irreparable  harm  before  a \nlater  trial  governed  by  the  full  rigor  of  usual  evidentiary \nstandards,  district  courts  may  look  to,  and  indeed  in \nappropriate circumstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible \nevidence  when  deciding  whether  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nwarranted. \nBecause  the  district  court  evaluated  G.G.’s  proffered \nevidence  against  a  stricter  evidentiary  standard  than  is \nwarranted  by  the  nature  and  purpose  of  preliminary  injunction \nproceedings to prevent irreparable harm before a full trial on \nthe  merits,  the  district  court  was  “guided  by  erroneous  legal \nprinciples.”    We  therefore  conclude  that  the  district  court \nabused  its  discretion  when  it  denied  G.G.’s  request  for  a \npreliminary  injunction  without  considering  G.G.’s  proffered \nevidence.    We  vacate  the  district  court’s  denial  of  G.G.’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction and remand the case to the \ndistrict court for consideration of G.G.’s evidence in light of \nthe evidentiary standards set forth herein. \n \n \n33 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 34 of 69 PageID# 792\nIV. \nFinally,  G.G.  requests  that  we  reassign  this  case  to  a \ndifferent  district  judge  on  remand.    G.G.  does  not  explicitly \nclaim that the district judge is biased.  Absent such a claim, \nreassignment is only appropriate in “unusual circumstances where \nboth  for  the  judge’s  sake  and  the  appearance  of  justice  an \nassignment to a different judge is salutary and in the public \ninterest,  especially  as  it  minimizes  even  a  suspicion  of \npartiality.”    United  States  v.  Guglielmi,  929  F.2d  1001,  1007 \n(4th Cir. 1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn determining whether such circumstances exist, a court should \nconsider:  (1)  whether  the  original  judge  would  reasonably  be \nexpected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting \nout of his or her mind previously expressed views or findings \ndetermined  to  be  erroneous  or  based  on  evidence  that  must  be \nrejected, (2) whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the \nappearance of justice, and (3) whether reassignment would entail \nwaste  and  duplication  out  of  proportion  to  any  gain  in \npreserving the appearance of fairness.  Id. (citation omitted). \n  G.G.  argues  that  both  the  first  and  second  Guglielmi \nfactors are satisfied.  He contends that the district court has \npre-existing views which it would be unwilling to put aside in \nthe  face  of  contrary  evidence  about  medical  science  generally \nand about “gender and sexuality in particular.”  Appellant’s Br. \n34 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 35 of 69 PageID# 793\n53.    For  example,  the  court  accepted  the  Board’s  “mating” \nconcern by noting:  \nThere  are  only  two  instincts—two.  \nEverything  else  is  acquired—everything.  \nThat  is,  the  brain  only  has  two  instincts.  \nOne  is  called  self-preservation,  and  the \nother  is  procreation.    And  procreation  is \nthe highest instinct in individuals who are \nin the latter part of their teen-age years.  \nAll  of  that  is  accepted  by  all  medical \nscience,  as  far  as  I  can  determine  in \nreading information. \n \nJ.A. 85-86. \n  The  district  court  also  expressed  skepticism  that  medical \nscience  supported  the  proposition  that  one  could  develop  a \nurinary  tract  infection  from  withholding  urine  for  too  long.  \nJ.A. 111-12.  The district court characterized gender dysphoria \nas a “mental disorder” and resisted several attempts by counsel \nfor G.G. to clarify that it only becomes a disorder when left \nuntreated.    See  J.A.  88-91;  101-02.    The  district  court  also \nseemed to reject G.G.’s representation of what it meant to be \ntransgender, repeatedly noting that G.G. “wants” to be a boy and \nnot a girl, but that “he is biologically a female.”  J.A. 103-\n04; see also J.A. 104 (“It’s his mind. It’s not physical that \ncauses  that,  it’s  what  he  believes.”).    The  district  court’s \nmemorandum  opinion,  however,  included  none  of  the  extraneous \nremarks or suppositions that marred the hearing. \n35 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 36 of 69 PageID# 794\n  Reassignment  is  an  unusual  step  at  this  early  stage  of \nlitigation.    Although  the  district  court  did  express  opinions \nabout medical facts and skepticism of G.G.’s claims, the record \ndoes not clearly indicate that the district judge would refuse \nto  consider  and  credit  sound  contrary  evidence.    Further, \nalthough the district court has a distinct way of proceeding in \ncourt, the hearing record and the district court’s written order \nin  the  case  do  not  raise  in  our  minds  a  question  about  the \nfundamental fairness of the proceedings, however idiosyncratic.  \nThe conduct of the district judge does not at this point satisfy \nthe Guglielmi standard.  We deny G.G.’s request for reassignment \nto a different district judge on remand. \n \nV. \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the  district \ncourt is \nREVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \n36 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 37 of 69 PageID# 795\nDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: \n  I  concur  in  Judge  Floyd’s  fine  opinion.    I  write \nseparately, however, to note that while I am happy to join in \nthe remand of this matter to the district court so that it may \nconsider  G.G.’s  evidence  under  proper  legal  standards  in  the \nfirst instance, this Court would be on sound ground in granting \nthe requested preliminary injunction on the undisputed facts in \nthe record.    \nI. \nIn  order  to  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction,  G.G.  must \ndemonstrate that (1) he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) \nhe  is  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of  an \ninjunction, (3) the balance of hardships tips in his favor, and \n(4) the requested injunction is in the public interest.  Pashby \nv. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 320 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing Winter v. \nNat.  Res.  Def.  Council,  555  U.S.  7,  20  (2008)).    The  record \nbefore us establishes that G.G. has done so. \nA. \nG.G.  alleges  that  by  singling  him  out  for  different \ntreatment because he is transgender, the Board’s restroom policy \ndiscriminates against him “on the basis of sex” in violation of \nTitle  IX.    In  light  of  the  weight  of  circuit  authority \nconcluding  that  discrimination  against  transgender  individuals \nconstitutes discrimination “on the basis of sex” in the context \n37 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 38 of 69 PageID# 796\nof analogous statutes and our holding here that the Department’s \ninterpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 is to be given controlling \nweight, G.G. has surely demonstrated a likelihood of success on \nthe  merits  of  his  Title  IX  claim.    See  Price  Waterhouse  v. \nHopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250–51 (1989); see also Glenn v. Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1316–19 (11th Cir. 2011); Smith v. City of Salem, \n378 F.3d  566, 573–75  (6th Cir.  2004);  Rosa  v.  Park  W.  Bank & \nTrust  Co.,  214  F.3d  213,  215–16  (1st  Cir.  2000);  Schwenk  v. \nHartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201–02 (9th Cir. 2000).  \nB. \nIn support of his claim of irreparable harm, G.G. submitted \nan affidavit to the district court describing the psychological \ndistress  he  experiences  when  he  is  forced  to  use  the  single-\nstall restrooms or the restroom in the nurse’s office.  See J.A. \n32–33.  His  affidavit  also  indicates  that  he  has  “repeatedly \ndeveloped  painful  urinary  tract  infections”  as  a  result  of \nholding  his  urine  in  order  to  avoid  using  the  restroom  at \nschool.  Id.   \nAn expert declaration by Dr. Randi Ettner, a psychologist \nspecializing  in  working  with  children  and  adolescents  with \ngender dysphoria, provides further support for G.G.’s claim of \nirreparable harm.  In her affidavit, Dr. Ettner indicates that \ntreating a transgender boy as male in some situations but not in \nothers is “inconsistent with evidence-based medical practice and \n38 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 39 of 69 PageID# 797\ndetrimental  to  the  health  and  well-being  of  the  child”  and \nexplains  why  access  to  a  restroom  appropriate  to  one’s  gender \nidentity  is  important  for  transgender  youth.    J.A.  39.    With \nrespect  to  G.G.  in  particular,  Dr.  Ettner  states  that  in  her \nprofessional opinion, the Board’s restroom policy “is currently \ncausing emotional distress to an extremely vulnerable youth and \nplacing G.G. at risk for accruing lifelong psychological harm.”  \nJ.A. 41.  In particular, Dr. Ettner opines that \n[a]s a result of the School Board’s restroom policy, . \n. . G.G. is put in the humiliating position of having \nto  use  a  separate  facility,  thereby  accentuating  his \n‘otherness,’  undermining  his  identity  formation,  and \nimpeding  his  medically  necessary  social  transition \nprocess.    The  shame  of  being  singled  out  and \nstigmatized in his daily life every time he needs to \nuse  the  restroom  is  a  devastating  blow  to  G.G.  and \nplaces him at extreme risk for immediate and long-term \npsychological harm. \n \nJ.A. 42. \n  The  Board  offers  nothing  to  contradict  any  of  the \nassertions concerning irreparable harm in G.G.’s or Dr. Ettner’s \naffidavits.  Instead, its arguments focus on what is purportedly \nlacking  from  G.G.’s  presentation  in  support  of  his  claim  of \nirreparable  harm,  such  as  “evidence  that  [his  feelings  of \ndysphoria, anxiety, and distress] would be lessened by using the \nboy[s’]  restroom,”  evidence  from  his  treating  psychologist, \nmedical  evidence,  and  an  opinion  from  Dr.  Ettner \n“differentiating  between  the  distress  that  G.G.  may  suffer  by \n39 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 40 of 69 PageID# 798\nnot  using  the  boy[s’]  bathroom  during  the  course  of  this \nlitigation and the distress that he has apparently been living \nwith  since  age  12.”    Br.  Appellee  42–43.    As  to  the  alleged \ndeficiency concerning Dr. Ettner’s opinion, the Board’s argument \nis  belied  by  Dr.  Ettner’s  affidavit  itself,  which,  as  quoted \nabove,  provides  her  opinion  about  the  psychological  harm  that \nG.G.  is  experiencing  “[a]s  a  result  of  the  School  Board’s \nrestroom policy.”  J.A. 42.  With respect to the other purported \ninadequacies,  the  absence  of  such  evidence  does  nothing  to \nundermine  the  uncontroverted  statements  concerning  the  daily \npsychological harm G.G. experiences as a result of the Board’s \npolicy  or  Dr.  Ettner’s  unchallenged  opinion  concerning  the \nsignificant long-term consequences of that harm.  Moreover, the \nBoard offers no argument to counter G.G.’s averment that he has \nrepeatedly contracted a urinary tract infection as a result of \nholding his urine to avoid using the restroom at school. \n  The  uncontroverted  facts  before  the  district  court \ndemonstrate  that  as  a  result  of  the  Board’s  restroom  policy, \nG.G. experiences daily psychological harm that puts him at risk \nfor  long-term  psychological  harm,  and  his  avoidance  of  the \nrestroom as a result of the Board’s policy puts him at risk for \ndeveloping a urinary tract infection as he has repeatedly in the \npast.    G.G.  has  thus  demonstrated  that  he  will  suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. \n40 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 41 of 69 PageID# 799\nC. \nTurning  to  the  balance  of  the  hardships,  G.G.  has  shown \nthat  he  will  suffer  irreparable  harm  without  the  requested \ninjunction.  On the other end of the scale, the Board contends \nthat  other  students’  constitutional  right  to  privacy  will  be \nimperiled by G.G.’s presence in the boys’ restroom. \n  As  the  majority  opinion  points  out,  G.G.’s  use  of  the \nrestroom  does  not  implicate  the  unconstitutional  actions \ninvolved in the cases cited by the dissent.  Moreover, students’ \nunintentional  exposure  of  their  genitals  to  others  using  the \nrestroom has already been largely, if not entirely, remedied by \nthe alterations to the school’s restrooms already undertaken by \nthe Board.  To the extent that a student simply objects to using \nthe restroom in the presence of a transgender student even where \nthere is no possibility that either student’s genitals will be \nexposed, all students have access to the single-stall restrooms.  \nFor other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no \nstigma whatsoever, whereas for G.G., using those same restrooms \nis tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of difference \namong his fellow students.  The minimal or non-existent hardship \nto  other  students  of  using  the  single-stall  restrooms  if  they \nobject to G.G.’s presence in the communal restroom thus does not \ntip the scale in the Board’s favor.  The balance of hardships \nweighs heavily toward G.G. \n41 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 42 of 69 PageID# 800\nD. \nFinally,  consideration  of  the  public  interest  in  granting \nor  denying  the  preliminary  injunction  favors  G.G.    Having \nconcluded that G.G. has demonstrated a likelihood of success on \nthe  merits  of  his  Title  IX  claim,  denying  the  requested \ninjunction would permit the Board to continue violating G.G.’s \nrights under Title IX for the pendency of this case.  Enforcing \nG.G.’s right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex \nin an educational institution is plainly in the public interest.  \nCf.  Giovani  Carandola,  Ltd.  v.  Bason,  303  F.3d  507,  521  (4th \nCir.  2002)  (citation  omitted)  (observing  that  upholding \nconstitutional rights is in the public interest).     \n  The  Board  contends  that  the  public  interest  lies  in \nallowing this issue to be determined by the legislature, citing \npending legislation before Congress addressing the issue before \nthe  Court.    But,  as  discussed  above,  the  weight  of  authority \nestablishes  that  discrimination  based  on  transgender  status  is \nalready  prohibited  by  the  language  of  federal  civil  rights \nstatutes, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  The existence of \nproposed legislation that, if passed, would address the question \nbefore  us  does  not  justify  forcing  G.G.  to  suffer  irreparable \nharm when he has demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits of his claims under current federal law.    \n \n42 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 43 of 69 PageID# 801\nII. \n  Based on the evidence presented to the district court, G.G. \nhas  satisfied  all  four  prongs  of  the  preliminary  injunction \ninquiry.    When  the  record  before  us  supports  entry  of  a \npreliminary  injunction—as  it  amply  does  here—we  have  not \nhesitated  to  act  to  prevent  irreparable  injury  to  a  litigant \nbefore us.  See, e.g., League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North \nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 248 (4th Cir. 2014) (expressly observing \nthat  appellate  courts  have  the  power  to  vacate  a  denial  of  a \npreliminary  injunction  and  direct  entry  of  an  injunction); \nEisenberg ex rel. Eisenberg v. Montgomery Cty. Pub. Schs., 197 \nF.3d  123,  134  (4th  Cir.  1999)  (directing  entry  of  injunction \n“because the record clearly establishes the plaintiff’s right to \nan  injunction  and  [an  evidentiary]  hearing  would  not  have \naltered the result”).   \nNevertheless, it is right and proper that we defer to the \ndistrict  court in this instance.   It is to  be  hoped that the \ndistrict court will turn its attention to this matter with the \nurgency  the  case  poses.    Under  the  circumstances  here,  the \nappropriateness  and  necessity  of  such  prompt  action  is  plain.  \nBy the time the district court issues its decision, G.G. will \nhave  suffered  the  psychological  harm  the  injunction  sought  to \nprevent for an entire school year. \n43 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 44 of 69 PageID# 802\nWith these additional observations, I concur fully in Judge \nFloyd’s thoughtful and thorough opinion for the panel. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n44 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 45 of 69 PageID# 803\nNIEMEYER,  Circuit  Judge,  concurring  in  part  and  dissenting  in \npart: \n \n  I concur in Part IV of the court’s opinion.  With respect \nto whether G.G. stated a claim under Title IX and whether the \ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying G.G’s motion for \na  preliminary  injunction,  I  would  affirm  the  ruling  of  the \ndistrict court dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and denying his \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  I therefore dissent from \nthe majority’s decision on those issues. \n  G.G.,  a  transgender  boy  who  is  16,  challenges  as \ndiscriminatory, under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX \nof  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972,  his  high  school’s  policy \nfor  assigning  students  to  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  based  on \nbiological  sex.    The  school’s  policy  provides:    (1)  that  the \ngirls’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  are  designated  for  use  by \nstudents  who  are  biologically  female;  (2)  that  the  boys’ \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  are  designated  for  use  by  students \nwho are biologically male; and (3) that all students, regardless \nof their sex, are authorized to use the school’s three single-\nstall unisex restrooms, which the school created to accommodate \ntransgender  students.    Under  this  policy,  G.G.,  who  is \nbiologically female but who identifies as male, is authorized to \nuse  the  girls’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  and  the  unisex \nrestrooms.  He contends, however, that the policy discriminates \n45 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 46 of 69 PageID# 804\nagainst  him  because  it  denies  him,  as  one  who  identifies  as \nmale, the use of the boys’ restrooms, and he seeks an injunction \ncompelling  the  high  school  to  allow  him  to  use  the  boys’ \nrestrooms. \n  The  district  court  dismissed  G.G.’s  Title  IX  claim, \nexplaining  that  the  school  complied  with  Title  IX  and  its \nregulations,  which  permit  schools  to  provide  separate  living \nfacilities,  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  shower  facilities  “on \nthe basis of sex,” so long as the facilities are “comparable.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b), 106.33.   \n  Strikingly, the majority now reverses the district court’s \nruling, without any supporting case law, and concludes that when \nTitle  IX  and  its  regulations  provide  for  separate  living \nfacilities,  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  shower  facilities  on \nthe basis of sex, the statute’s and regulations’ use of the term \n“sex”  means  a  person’s  gender  identity,  not  the  person’s \nbiological status as male or female.  To accomplish its goal, \nthe  majority  relies  entirely  on  a  2015  letter  sent  by  the \nDepartment  of  Education’s  Office  for  Civil  Rights  to  G.G.,  in \nwhich the Office for Civil Rights stated, “When a school elects \nto separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex \n[when  providing  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  shower  facilities, \nhousing,  athletic  teams,  and  single-sex  classes],  a  school \ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their \n46 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 47 of 69 PageID# 805\ngender  identity.”    (Emphasis  added).    Accepting  that  new \ndefinition of the statutory term “sex,” the majority’s opinion, \nfor the first time ever, holds that a public high school may not \nprovide  separate  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  on  the  basis  of \nbiological  sex.    Rather,  it  must  now  allow  a  biological  male \nstudent who identifies as female to use the girls’ restrooms and \nlocker  rooms  and,  likewise,  must  allow  a  biological  female \nstudent who identifies as male to use the boys’ restrooms and \nlocker  rooms.    This  holding  completely  tramples  on  all \nuniversally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are \nbased  on  the  anatomical  differences  between  the  sexes.    And, \nunwittingly, it also tramples on the very concerns expressed by \nG.G., who said that he should not be forced to go to the girls’ \nrestrooms  because  of  the  “severe  psychological  distress”  it \nwould  inflict  on  him  and  because  female  students  had  “reacted \nnegatively”  to  his  presence  in  girls’  restrooms.    Surely \nbiological males who identify as females would encounter similar \nreactions  in  the  girls’  restroom,  just  as  students  physically \nexposed  to  students  of  the  opposite  biological  sex  would  be \nlikely  to  experience  psychological  distress.    As  a  result, \nschools would no longer be able to protect physiological privacy \nas between students of the opposite biological sex. \n  This  unprecedented  holding  overrules  custom,  culture,  and \nthe  very  demands  inherent  in  human  nature  for  privacy  and \n47 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 48 of 69 PageID# 806\nsafety, which the separation of such facilities is designed to \nprotect.    More  particularly,  it  also  misconstrues  the  clear \nlanguage  of  Title  IX  and  its  regulations.    And  finally,  it \nreaches an unworkable and illogical result. \nThe recent Office for Civil Rights letter, moreover, which \nis not law but which is the only authority on which the majority \nrelies,  states  more  than  the  majority  acknowledges.    In  the \nsentence  following  the  sentence  on  which  the  majority  relies, \nthe  letter  states  that,  to  accommodate  transgender  students, \nschools  are  encouraged  “to  offer  the  use  of  gender-neutral, \nindividual-user facilities to any student who does not want to \nuse shared sex-segregated facilities [as permitted by Title IX’s \nregulations].”  This appears to approve the course that G.G.’s \nschool followed when it created unisex restrooms in addition to \nthe boys’ and girls’ restrooms it already had. \nTitle  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  are  not \nambiguous.  In recognition of physiological privacy and safety \nconcerns,  they  allow  schools  to  provide  “separate  living \nfacilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, provided \nthat  the  facilities  are  “proportionate”  and  “comparable,”  34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.32(b),  and  to  provide  “separate  toilet,  locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” again provided \nthat  the  facilities  are  “comparable,”  34  C.F.R.  § 106.33.  \nBecause the school’s policy that G.G. challenges in this action \n48 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 49 of 69 PageID# 807\ncomports with Title IX and its regulations, I would affirm the \ndistrict court’s dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.   \n \nI \nThe relevant facts are not in dispute.  G.G. is a 16 year-\nold  who  attends  Gloucester  High  School  in  Gloucester  County, \nVirginia.  He is biologically female, but “did not feel like a \ngirl” from an early age.  Still, he enrolled at Gloucester High \nSchool for his freshman year as a female. \nDuring  his  freshman  year,  however,  G.G.  told  his  parents \nthat  he  considered  himself  to  be  transgender,  and  shortly \nthereafter,  at  his  request,  he  began  therapy  with  a \npsychologist,  who  diagnosed  him  with  gender  dysphoria,  a \ncondition of distress brought about by the incongruence of one’s \nbiological sex and gender identity. \nIn August 2014, before beginning his sophomore year, G.G. \nand his mother met with the principal and guidance counselor at \nGloucester  High  School  to  discuss  his  need,  as  part  of  his \ntreatment,  to  socially  transition  at  school.    The  school \naccommodated  all  of  his  requests.    Officials  changed  school \nrecords to reflect G.G.’s new male name; the guidance counselor \nsupported G.G.’s sending an email to teachers explaining that he \nwas to be addressed using his  new  name  and  to  be referred to \nusing male pronouns; G.G. was permitted to fulfill his physical \n49 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 50 of 69 PageID# 808\neducation  requirement  through  a  home-bound  program,  as  he \npreferred not to use the school’s locker rooms; and the school \nallowed G.G. to use a restroom in the nurse’s office “because \n[he]  was  unsure  how  other  students  would  react  to  [his] \ntransition.”    G.G.  was  grateful  for  the  school’s  “welcoming \nenvironment.”    As  he  stated,  “no  teachers,  administrators,  or \nstaff  at  Gloucester  High  School  expressed  any  resistance  to \ncalling [him] by [his] legal name or referring to [him] using \nmale  pronouns.”    And  he  was  “pleased  to  discover  that  [his] \nteachers and the vast majority of [his] peers respected the fact \nthat [he is] a boy.”  \nAs  the  school  year  began,  however,  G.G.  found  it \n“stigmatizing”  to  continue  using  the  nurse’s  restroom,  and  he \nrequested  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms.    The  principal  also \naccommodated this request.  But the very next day, the School \nBoard  began  receiving  “numerous  complaints  from  parents  and \nstudents about [G.G.’s] use of the boys’ restrooms.”  The School \nBoard thus faced a dilemma.  It recognized G.G.’s feelings, as \nhe  expressed  them,  that  “[u]sing  the  girls’  restroom[s]  [was] \nnot possible” because of the “severe psychological distress” it \nwould inflict on him and because female students had previously \n“reacted  negatively”  to  his  presence  in  the  girls’  restrooms.  \nIt  now  also  had  to  recognize  that  boys  had  similar  feelings \ncaused  by  G.G.’s  use  of  the  boys’  restrooms,  although  G.G. \n50 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 51 of 69 PageID# 809\nstated  that  he  continued  using  the  boys’  restrooms  for  some \nseven weeks without personally receiving complaints from fellow \nstudents. \nThe  Gloucester  County  School  Board  considered  the  problem \nand, after two public meetings, adopted a compromise policy, as \nfollows:  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  recognizes  that  some  students \nquestion their gender identities, and  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  encourages  such  students  to  seek \nsupport,  advice,  and  guidance  from  parents, \nprofessionals and other trusted adults, and \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe  learning \nenvironment  for  all  students  and  to  protect  the \nprivacy of all students, therefore  \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male \nand female restroom and locker room facilities in its \nschools,  and  the  use  of  said  facilities  shall  be \nlimited  to  the  corresponding  biological  genders,  and \nstudents with gender identity issues shall be provided \nan alternative appropriate private facility. \nGloucester  High  School  promptly  implemented  the  policy  and \ncreated  three  single-stall  unisex  restrooms  for  use  by  all \nstudents, regardless of their biological sex or gender identity. \n  In December 2014, G.G. sought an opinion letter about his \nsituation  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s  Office  for \nCivil  Rights,  and  on  January  15,  2015,  the  Office  responded, \nstating, as relevant here: \nThe  Department’s  Title  IX  regulations  permit  schools \nto  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms,  locker  rooms, \nshower  facilities,  housing,  athletic  teams,  and \nsingle-sex classes under certain circumstances.  When \n51 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 52 of 69 PageID# 810\na  school  elects  to  separate  or  treat  students \ndifferently on the basis of sex in those situations, a \nschool  generally  must  treat  transgender  students \nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity.    [The  Office \nfor Civil Rights] also encourages schools to offer the \nuse  of  gender-neutral,  individual-user  facilities  to \nany  student  who  does  not  want  to  use  shared  sex-\nsegregated facilities. \n  G.G. commenced this action in June 2015, alleging that the \nGloucester  County  School  Board’s  policy  was  discriminatory,  in \nviolation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net  seq.    He  sought  declaratory  relief,  injunctive  relief,  and \ndamages.    With  his  complaint,  G.G.  also  filed  a  motion  for  a \npreliminary  injunction  “requiring  the  School  Board  to  allow \n[him] to use the boys’ restrooms at school.” \n  The district court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim because \nTitle  IX’s  implementing  regulations  permit  schools  to  provide \nseparate restrooms “on the basis of sex.”  The court also denied \nG.G.’s  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction.    As  to  the  Equal \nProtection claim, the court has not yet ruled on whether G.G. \nfailed to state a claim, but, at the hearing on the motion for a \npreliminary  injunction,  it  indicated  that  it  “will  hear \nevidence” and “get a date set” for trial to better assess the \nclaim. \n  From the district court’s order denying G.G.’s motion for a \npreliminary injunction, G.G. filed this appeal, in which he also \n52 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 53 of 69 PageID# 811\nchallenges the district court’s Title IX ruling as inextricably \nintertwined with the district court’s denial of the motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \n \nII \n  G.G.  recognizes  that  persons  who  are  born  biologically \nfemale  “typically”  identify  psychologically  as  female,  and \nlikewise,  that  persons  who  are  born  biologically  male \n“typically”  identify  as  male.    Because  G.G.  was  born \nbiologically  female  but  identifies  as  male,  he  characterizes \nhimself as a transgender male.  He contends that because he is \ntransgender, the School Board singled him out for “different and \nunequal  treatment,”  “discriminat[ing]  against  him  based  on  sex \n[by  denying  him  use  of  the  boys’  restrooms],  in  violation  of \nTitle  IX.”    He  argues,  “discrimination  against  transgender \npeople is necessarily discrimination based on sex because it is \nimpossible  to  treat  people  differently  based  on  their \ntransgender status without taking their sex into account.”  He \nconcludes  that  the  School  Board’s  policy  addressing  restrooms \nand  locker  rooms  thus  illegally  fails  to  include  transgender \npersons on the basis of their gender identity.  In particular, \nhe concludes that he is “prevent[ed] . . . from using the same \nrestrooms as other students and relegat[ed] . . . to separate, \nsingle-stall facilities.”   \n53 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 54 of 69 PageID# 812\n  As noted, the School Board’s policy designates the use of \nrestrooms and locker rooms based on the student’s biological sex \n-- biological females are assigned to the girls’ restrooms and \nunisex  restrooms;  biological  males  are  assigned  to  the  boys’ \nrestrooms and unisex restrooms.  G.G. is thus assigned to the \ngirls’ restrooms and the unisex restrooms, but is denied the use \nof  the  boys’  restrooms.    He  asserts,  however,  that  because \nneither  he  nor  the  girls  would  accept  his  use  of  the  girls’ \nrestroom,  he  is  relegated  to  the  unisex  restrooms,  which  is \nstigmatizing.   \n  The School Board contends that it is treating all students \nthe same way, as it explains: \nThe  School  Board’s  policy  does  not  discriminate \nagainst  any  class  of  students.    Instead,  the  policy \nwas developed to treat all students and situations the \nsame.    To  respect  the  safety  and  privacy  of  all \nstudents,  the  School  Board  has  had  a  long-standing \npractice  of  limiting  the  use  of  restroom  and  locker \nroom facilities to the corresponding biological sex of \nthe  students.    The  School  Board  also  provides  three \nsingle-stall  bathrooms  for  any  student  to  use \nregardless  of  his  or  her  biological  sex.    Under  the \nSchool Board’s restroom policy, G.G. is being treated \nlike  every  other  student  in  the  Gloucester  Schools.  \nAll students have two choices.  Every student can use \na  restroom  associated  with  their  anatomical  sex, \nwhether  they  are  boys  or  girls.    If  students  choose \nnot  to  use  the  restroom  associated  with  their \nanatomical  sex,  the  students  can  use  a  private, \nsingle-stall restroom.  No student is permitted to use \nthe restroom of the opposite sex.  As a result, all \nstudents,  including  female  to  male  transgender  and \nmale  to  female  transgender  students,  are  treated  the \nsame. \n54 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 55 of 69 PageID# 813\n  While G.G. has pending a claim under the Equal Protection \nClause (on which the district court has not yet ruled), only his \npreliminary injunction challenge and Title IX claim are before \nus at this time.   \n  Title IX provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under \nany  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal \nfinancial assistance . . . . \n20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a)  (emphasis  added).    The  Act,  however, \nprovides, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in \nthis  chapter,  nothing  contained  herein  shall  be  construed  to \nprohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this \nAct,  from  maintaining  separate  living  facilities  for  the \ndifferent  sexes.”    Id.  §  1686  (emphasis  added);  see  also  34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.32(b)  (permitting  schools  to  provide  “separate \nhousing  on  the  basis  of  sex”  as  long  as  the  housing  is \n“proportionate” and “comparable” (emphasis added)).  Similarly, \nimplementing Regulation 106.33 provides for particular separate \nfacilities, as follows: \nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, \nand  shower  facilities  on  the  basis  of  sex,  but  such \nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of \nthe other sex. \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added).  Thus, although Title IX \nand  its  regulations  provide  generally  that  a  school  receiving \n55 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 56 of 69 PageID# 814\nfederal  funds  may  not  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  sex,  they \nalso  specify  that  a  school  does  not  violate  the  Act  by \nproviding,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  separate  living  facilities, \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities.   \nWhile  G.G.  only  challenges  the  definition  and  application \nof the term “sex” with respect to separate restrooms, acceptance \nof his argument would necessarily change the definition of “sex” \nfor  purposes  of  assigning  separate  living  facilities,  locker \nrooms, and shower facilities as well.  All are based on “sex,” a \nterm  that  must  be  construed  uniformly  throughout  Title  IX  and \nits implementing regulations.  See Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U.S. \n478,  484  (1990)  (“[T]he  normal  rule  of  statutory  construction \n[is] that identical words used in different parts of the same \nact are intended to have the same meaning” (internal quotation \nmarks  and  citations  omitted));  In  re  Total  Realty  Mgmt.,  LLC, \n706 F.3d 245, 251 (4th Cir. 2013) (“Canons of construction . . . \nrequire that, to the extent possible, identical terms or phrases \nused in different parts of the same statute be interpreted as \nhaving  the  same  meaning.

Manning, \nConstitutional  Structure  and  Judicial  Deference  to  Agency \nInterpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 627 n.78 \n(1996))). \nAcross  societies  and  throughout  history,  it  has  been \ncommonplace  and  universally  accepted  to  separate  public \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of \nbiological sex in order to address privacy and safety concerns \narising  from  the  biological  differences  between  males  and \nfemales.  An individual has a legitimate and important interest \nin bodily privacy such that his or her nude or partially nude \nbody,  genitalia,  and  other  private  parts  are  not  exposed  to \npersons  of  the  opposite  biological  sex.    Indeed,  courts  have \nconsistently  recognized  that  the  need  for  such  privacy  is \ninherent in the nature and dignity of humankind.  See, e.g., Doe \nv.  Luzerne  Cnty.,  660  F.3d  169,  176-77  (3d  Cir.  2011) \n(recognizing  that  an  individual  has  “a  constitutionally \nprotected privacy interest in his or her partially clothed body” \nand  that  this  “reasonable  expectation  of  privacy”  exists \n“particularly while in the presence of members of the opposite \nsex”); Brannum v. Overton Cnty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th \nCir. 2008) (explaining that “the constitutional right to privacy \n. . . includes the right to shield one’s body from exposure to \n57 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 58 of 69 PageID# 816\nviewing  by  the  opposite  sex”);  Beard  v.  Whitmore  Lake  Sch. \nDist., 402 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Students of course \nhave a significant privacy interest in their unclothed bodies”); \nSepulveda  v.  Ramirez,  967  F.2d  1413,  1416  (9th  Cir.  1992) \n(explaining that “[t]he right to bodily privacy is fundamental” \nand  that  “common  sense,  decency,  and  [state]  regulations” \nrequire recognizing it in a parolee’s right not to be observed \nby  an  officer  of  the  opposite  sex  while  producing  a  urine \nsample);  Lee  v.  Downs,  641  F.2d  1117,  1119  (4th  Cir.  1989) \n(recognizing that, even though inmates in prison “surrender many \nrights  of  privacy,”  their  “special  sense  of  privacy  in  their \ngenitals”  should  not  be  violated  through  exposure  unless \n“reasonably  necessary”  and  explaining  that  the  “involuntary \nexposure of [genitals] in the presence of people of the other \nsex may be especially demeaning and humiliating”).   \nMoreover, we have explained that separating restrooms based \non  “acknowledged  differences”  between  the  biological  sexes \nserves to protect this important privacy interest.  See Faulkner \nv. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting “society’s \nundisputed  approval  of  separate  public  rest  rooms  for  men  and \nwomen  based  on  privacy  concerns”).    Indeed,  the  Supreme  Court \nrecognized, when ordering an all-male Virginia college to admit \nfemale students, that such a remedy “would undoubtedly require \nalterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from \n58 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 59 of 69 PageID# 817\nthe other sex.”  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 \nn.19 (1996).  Such privacy was and remains necessary because of \nthe  inherent  “[p]hysical  differences  between  men  and  women,” \nwhich, as the Supreme Court explained, are “enduring” and render \n“the two sexes . . . not fungible,” id. at 533 (distinguishing \nsex from race and national origin), not because of “one’s sense \nof oneself as belonging to a particular gender,” as G.G. and the \ngovernment as amicus contend. \n  Thus,  Title  IX’s  allowance  for  the  separation,  based  on \nsex, of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower \nfacilities rests on the universally accepted concern for bodily \nprivacy  that  is  founded  on  the  biological  differences  between \nthe  sexes.    This  privacy  concern  is  also  linked  to  safety \nconcerns  that  could  arise  from  sexual  responses  prompted  by \nstudents’ exposure to the private body parts of students of the \nother biological sex.  Indeed, the School Board cited these very \nreasons  for  its  adoption  of  the  policy,  explaining  that  it \nseparates restrooms and locker rooms to promote the privacy and \nsafety of minor children, pursuant to its “responsibility to its \nstudents  to  ensure  their  privacy  while  engaging  in  personal \nbathroom  functions,  disrobing,  dressing,  and  showering  outside \nof  the  presence  of  members  of  the  opposite  sex.    [That  the \nschool  has  this  responsibility]  is  particularly  true  in  an \n59 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 60 of 69 PageID# 818\nenvironment  where  children  are  still  developing,  both \nemotionally and physically.”   \n  The  need  to  protect  privacy  and  safety  between  the  sexes \nbased  on  physical  exposure  would  not  be  present  in  the  same \nquality and degree if the term “sex” were to encompass only a \nperson’s  gender  identity.    Indeed,  separation  on  this  basis \nwould function nonsensically.  A biological male identifying as \nfemale could hardly live in a girls’ dorm or shower in a girls’ \nshower  without  invading  physiological  privacy  needs,  and  the \nsame would hold true for a biological female identifying as male \nin a boys’ dorm or shower.  G.G.’s answer, of course, is that he \nis  not  challenging  the  separation,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  of \nliving facilities, locker rooms, and shower facilities, but only \nof  restrooms,  where  the  risks  to  privacy  and  safety  are  far \nreduced.  This effort to limit the scope of the issue apparently \nsways  the  majority,  as  it  cabins  its  entire  discussion  to \n“restroom access by transgender individuals.”  Ante at 26.  But \nthis  effort  to  restrict  the  effect  of  G.G.’s  argument  hardly \nmatters when the term “sex” would have to be applied uniformly \nthroughout  the  statute  and  regulations,  as  noted  above  and, \nindeed, as agreed to by the majority.  See ante at 26. \n  The  realities  underpinning  Title  IX’s  recognition  of \nseparate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower \nfacilities  are  reflected  in  the  plain  language  of  the  statute \n60 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 61 of 69 PageID# 819\nand regulations, which is not ambiguous.  The text of Title IX \nand its regulations allowing for separation of each facility “on \nthe  basis  of  sex”  employs  the  term  “sex”  as  was  generally \nunderstood at the time of enactment.  See Thomas Jefferson Univ. \nv.  Shalala,  512  U.S.  504,  512  (1994)  (explaining  that  courts \nshould  not  defer  to  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  its  own \nregulation  if  an  “alternative  reading  is  compelled  by  the \nregulation’s  plain  language  or  by  other  indications  of  the \nSecretary’s intent at the time of the regulation’s promulgation” \n(emphasis  added)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation \nomitted)); see also Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) \n(discussing dictionary definitions of the regulation’s “critical \nphrase”  to  help  determine  whether  the  agency’s  interpretation \nwas  “plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the  regulation” \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  Title IX was \nenacted in 1972 and the regulations were promulgated in 1975 and \nreadopted in 1980, and during that time period, virtually every \ndictionary  definition  of  “sex”  referred  to  the  physiological \ndistinctions  between  males  and  females,  particularly  with \nrespect to their reproductive functions.  See, e.g., The Random \nHouse College Dictionary 1206 (rev. ed. 1980) (“either the male \nor  female  division  of  a  species,  esp.  as  differentiated  with \nreference  to  the  reproductive  functions”);  Webster’s  New \nCollegiate Dictionary 1054 (1979) (“the sum of the structural, \n61 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 62 of 69 PageID# 820\nfunctional, and behavioral characteristics of living beings that \nsubserve  reproduction  by  two  interacting  parents  and  that \ndistinguish  males  and  females”);  American  Heritage  Dictionary \n1187  (1976)  (“The  property  or  quality  by  which  organisms  are \nclassified  according  to  their  reproductive  functions”); \nWebster’s  Third New  International  Dictionary  2081  (1971)  (“the \nsum  of  the  morphological,  physiological,  and  behavioral \npeculiarities  of  living  beings  that  subserves  biparental \nreproduction  with  its  concomitant  genetic  segregation  and \nrecombination  which  underlie  most  evolutionary  change . . .”); \nThe  American  College  Dictionary  1109  (1970)  (“the  sum  of  the \nanatomical and physiological differences with reference to which \nthe  male  and  the  female  are  distinguished  . . .  ”).    Indeed, \nalthough  the  contemporaneous  meaning  controls  our  analysis,  it \nis  notable  that,  even  today,  the  term  “sex”  continues  to  be \ndefined  based  on  the  physiological  distinctions  between  males \nand females.  See, e.g., Webster’s New World College Dictionary \n1331  (5th  ed.  2014)  (“either  of  the  two  divisions,  male  or \nfemale, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with \nreference  to  their  reproductive  functions”);  The  American \nHeritage  Dictionary  1605  (5th  ed.  2011)  (“Either  of  the  two \ndivisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms \nare  classified  on  the  basis  of  their  reproductive  organs  and \nfunctions”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1140 (11th \n62 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 63 of 69 PageID# 821\ned. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of individuals that \noccur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as \nfemale or male esp. on the basis of their reproductive organs \nand  structures”).    Any  new  definition  of  sex  that  excludes \nreference  to  physiological  differences,  as  the  majority  now \nattempts  to  introduce,  is  simply  an  unsupported  reach  to \nrationalize a desired outcome.   \nThus, when the School Board assigned restrooms and locker \nrooms on the basis of biological sex, it was clearly complying \nprecisely  with  the  unambiguous  language  of  Title  IX  and  its \nregulations.   \nDespite  the  fact  that  the  majority  offers  no  case  to \nsupport  the  definition  of  “sex”  as  advanced  by  G.G.  and \nsupported by the government as amicus, the majority nonetheless \naccepts that the meaning of the term “sex” in Title IX and its \nregulations  refers  to  a  person’s  “gender  identity”  simply  to \naccommodate G.G.’s wish to use the boys’ restrooms.  But, it is \nnot immediately apparent whether G.G., the government, and the \nmajority contend that the term “sex” as used in Title IX and its \nregulations  refers  (1)  to  both  biological  sex  and  gender \nidentity;  (2)  to  either  biological  sex  or  gender  identity;  or \n(3) to only “gender identity.”  In his brief, G.G. seems to take \nthe position that the term “sex” at least includes a reference \nto gender identity.  This is the position taken in his complaint \n63 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 64 of 69 PageID# 822\nwhen he alleges, “Under Title IX, discrimination ‘on the basis \nof  sex’  encompasses  both  discrimination  based  on  biological \ndifferences  between  men  and  women  and  discrimination  based  on \ngender  nonconformity.”    The  government  seems  to  be  taking  the \nsame position, contending that the term “sex” “encompasses both \nsex -- that is, the biological differences between men and women \n--  and  gender  [identity].”    (Emphasis  in  original).    The \nmajority, however, seems to suggest that the term “sex” refers \nonly to gender identity, as it relies solely on the statement in \nthe Office for Civil Rights’ letter of January 7, 2015, which \nsaid,  “When  a  school  elects  to  separate  or  treat  students \ndifferently on the basis of sex [for the purpose of providing \nrestrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  other  facilities],  a  school \ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their \ngender identity.”  (Emphasis added).  But, regardless of where \nG.G., the government, and the majority purport to stand on this \nquestion, the clear effect of their new definition of sex not \nonly tramples the relevant statutory and regulatory language and \ndisregards the privacy concerns animating that text, it is also \nillogical and unworkable. \nIf the term “sex” as used in the statute and regulations \nrefers to both biological sex and gender identity, then, while \nthe School Board’s policy is in compliance with respect to most \nstudents,  whose  biological  sex  aligns  with  their  gender \n64 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 65 of 69 PageID# 823\nidentity, for students whose biological sex and gender identity \ndo not align, no restroom or locker room separation could ever \nbe  accomplished  consistent  with  the  regulation  because  a \ntransgender  student’s  use  of  a  boys’  or  girls’  restroom  or \nlocker room could not satisfy the conjunctive criteria.  Given \nthat G.G. and the government do not challenge schools’ ability \nto  separate  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  for  male  and  female \nstudents,  surely  they  cannot  be  advocating  an  interpretation \nthat places schools in an impossible position.  Moreover, such \nan interpretation would deny G.G. the right to use either the \nboys’  or  girls’  restrooms,  a  position  that  G.G.  does  not \nadvocate. \nIf the position of G.G., the government, and the majority \nis  that  the  term  “sex”  means  either  biological  sex  or  gender \nidentity,  then  the  School  Board’s  policy  is  in  compliance \nbecause it segregates the facilities on the basis of biological \nsex, a satisfactory component of the disjunctive.   \nTherefore, when asserting that G.G. must be allowed to use \nthe  boys’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  as  consistent  with  his \ngender identity, G.G., the government, and the majority must be \narguing that “sex” as used in Title IX and its regulations means \nonly gender identity.  But this construction would, in the end, \nmean  that  a  school  could  never  meaningfully  provide  separate \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  on  the  basis  of  sex.    Biological \n65 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 66 of 69 PageID# 824\nmales  and  females  whose  gender  identity  aligned  would  be \nrequired to use the same restrooms and locker rooms as persons \nof  the  opposite  biological  sex  whose  gender  identity  did  not \nalign.  With such mixed use of separate facilities, no purpose \nwould be gained by designating a separate use “on the basis of \nsex,” and privacy concerns would be left unaddressed. \nMoreover, enforcement of any separation would be virtually \nimpossible.    Basing  restroom  access  on  gender  identity  would \nrequire schools to assume gender identity based on appearances, \nsocial expectations, or explicit declarations of identity, which \nthe  government  concedes  would  render  Title  IX  and  its \nregulations nonsensical: \nCertainly a school that has created separate restrooms \nfor boys and girls could not decide that only students \nwho dress, speak, and act sufficiently masculine count \nas  boys  entitled  to  use  the  boys’  restroom,  or  that \nonly  students  who  wear  dresses,  have  long  hair,  and \nact sufficiently feminine may use the girls’ restroom.  \nYet, by interpreting Title IX and the regulations as “requiring \nschools  to  treat  students  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity,”  and  by  disallowing  schools  from  treating  students \nbased on their biological sex, the government’s position would \nhave  precisely  the  effect  the  government  finds  to  be  at  odds \nwith common sense.   \nFinally, in arguing that he should not be assigned to the \ngirls’ restrooms, G.G. states that “it makes no sense to place a \n66 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 67 of 69 PageID# 825\ntransgender boy in the girls’ restroom in the name of protecting \nstudent privacy” because “girls objected to his presence in the \ngirls’ restrooms because they perceived him as male.”  But the \nsame argument applies to his use of the boys’ restrooms, where \nboys  felt  uncomfortable  because  they  perceived  him  as  female.  \nIn any scenario based on gender identity, moreover, there would \nbe  no  accommodation  for  the  recognized  need  for  physiological \nprivacy. \n  In  short,  it  is  impossible  to  determine  how  G.G.,  the \ngovernment, and the majority would apply the provisions of Title \nIX  and  the  implementing  regulations  that  allow  for  the \nseparation  of  living  facilities,  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and \nshower facilities “on the basis of sex” if “sex” means gender \nidentity.   \n  The Office for Civil Rights letter, on which the majority \nexclusively relies, hardly provides an answer.  In one sentence \nit  states  that  schools  “generally  must  treat  transgender \nstudents  consistent  with  their  gender  identity,”  whatever  that \nmeans,  and  in  the  next  sentence,  it  encourages  schools  to \nprovide  “gender-neutral,  individual-user  facilities  to  any \nstudent  who  does  not  want  to  use  shared  sex-segregated \nfacilities.”    While  the  first  sentence  might  be  impossible  to \nenforce  without  destroying  all  privacy-serving  separation,  the \nsecond  sentence  encourages  schools,  such  as  Gloucester  High \n67 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 68 of 69 PageID# 826\nSchool,  to  provide  unisex  single-stall  restrooms  for  any \nstudents who are uncomfortable with sex-separated facilities, as \nthe school in fact provided. \n  As  it  stands,  Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations \nauthorize  schools  to  separate,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  living \nfacilities,  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  shower  facilities, \nwhich must allow for separation on the basis of biological sex.  \nGloucester  High  School  thus  clearly  complied  with  the  statute \nand  regulations.    But,  as  it  did  so,  it  was  nonetheless \nsensitive  to  G.G.’s  gender  transition,  accommodating  virtually \nevery wish that he had.  Indeed, he initially requested and was \ngranted the use of the nurse’s restroom.  And, after both girls \nand boys objected to his using the girls’ and boys’ restrooms, \nthe  school  provided  individual  unisex  restrooms,  as  encouraged \nby  the  letter  from  the  Office  for  Civil  Rights.    Thus,  while \nGloucester High School made a good-faith effort to accommodate \nG.G. and help him in his transition, balancing its concern for \nhim  with  its  responsibilities  to  all  students,  it  still  acted \nlegally in maintaining a policy that provided all students with \nphysiological privacy and safety in restrooms and locker rooms.   \nBecause the Gloucester County School Board did not violate \nTitle  IX  and  Regulation  106.33  in  adopting  the  policy  for \nseparate restrooms and locker rooms, I would affirm the district \n68 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 62   Filed 04/19/16   Page 69 of 69 PageID# 827\ncourt’s decision dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and therefore \ndissent. \nI also dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate the \ndistrict  court’s  denial  of  G.G.’s  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  As  the  Supreme  Court  has  consistently  explained, \n“[a]  preliminary  injunction  is  an  extraordinary  remedy”  that \n“may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is \nentitled  to  such  relief,”  and  “‘[i]n  exercising  their  sound \ndiscretion,  courts  of  equity  should  pay  particular  regard  for \nthe public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy.’”  \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22-24 (2008) \n(quoting  Weinberger  v.  Romero-Barcelo,  456  U.S.  305,  312 \n(1982)).    Given  the  facts  that  the  district  court  fully  and \nfairly  summarized  in  its  opinion,  including  the  hardships \nexpressed both by G.G. and by other students, I cannot conclude \nthat we can “form a definite and firm conviction that the court \nbelow committed a clear error of judgment,” Morris v. Wachovia \nSec., Inc., 448 F.3d 268, 277 (4th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks \nand  citation  omitted),  particularly  when  we  are  only  now \nexpressing  as  binding  law  an  evidentiary  standard  that  the \nmajority asserts the district court violated. \n  As  noted,  however,  I  concur  in  Part  IV  of  the  court’s \nopinion. \n \n69 ",

G.G. is a 16-year-old boy who recently completed his sophomore year at \nGloucester High School.  He is a boy who is transgender, which means that he was designated \nfemale at birth but he has a male gender identity.  He has been diagnosed by medical \nprofessionals as having Gender Dysphoria, which is a serious medical condition characterized by \nclinically significant distress caused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and \nthe person’s assigned sex at birth. \n2.  Since the end of his freshman year, G.G. has undergone treatment for Gender \nDysphoria, in accordance with the widely recognized standards of care for that condition. A \ncritical element of that treatment is a “social transition” in which G.G. lives in accordance with \nhis gender identity as a boy in all aspects of his life. As part of that process, G.G. has legally \nchanged his name to “G.G.” (a traditionally male name).  \n3.  Shortly before his sophomore year, G.G. and his mother informed school officials \nthat G.G. is a transgender boy.  School officials immediately expressed support for G.G. and \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 2 of 16 PageID# 108\n \ntook steps to ensure that he would be treated as a boy by teachers and staff.  Later in the school \nyear, at G.G.’s request, and consistent with recognized standards of care for transgender students, \nschool officials allowed him to use the boys’ restroom.  He did so without incident for \napproximately seven weeks. \n4.  On December 9, 2014, the Gloucester County School Board, responding to \npressure from some parents – and other Gloucester County residents without school-age children \n– enacted a policy that overruled the decision of school administrators and categorically barred \ntransgender students from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.  The policy \ndeclared that access to the boys’ and girls’ restrooms would be limited to students of “the \ncorresponding biological genders,” and also declared that students who are unable to use such \nrestrooms because of “gender identity issues” would be relegated to “an alternative appropriate \nprivate facility.” \n5.  As a result of the School Board’s transgender restroom policy, G.G. is currently \nthe only student in his school who must use separate private restrooms.  The distinction \nstigmatizes G.G. and marks him as different from the other students; it isolates G.G. from his \npeers; and it exposes him to serious psychological harm.  To avoid the stigma of having to use \nseparate restrooms, G.G. has tried to avoid using any restroom during the school day. \n6.  The School Board’s transgender restroom policy discriminates against G.G. on \nthe basis of gender and sex in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.G.G. seeks redress from this \nCourt. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 3 of 16 PageID# 109\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This action arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681, et seq., the Constitution of the United States, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § \n1331.Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n8.  Venue lies with this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1)-(2), because the \ndefendant resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff G.G. is sixteen years old and is a student at Gloucester High School \n(“GHS”), a public high school in Gloucester County. \n10.  Deirdre Grimm is G.G.’s mother and sues as his next friend. \n11.  The Gloucester County School Board (the “School Board”) is an elected body \nresponsible for the operation of the Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”), including the \npromulgation of policies.  At all times relevant, the School Board has acted and continues to act \nunder color of state law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n12.  G.G. was born in Gloucester County on May 4, 1999, and has lived in Gloucester \nCounty his entire life.  G.G. is a typical teenager who is articulate and intelligent, reads broadly, \nloves his dog and cats, and enjoys hanging out with his friends. \n13.  Photographs of G.G. taken over the past year are attached as Exhibit A. \n14.  G.G. is also a transgender boy.  That is, his assigned sex at birth was female, but \nthat designation does not conform to his male gender identity.  G.G. has been diagnosed with \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 4 of 16 PageID# 110\n \nGender Dysphoria, the medical diagnosis for individuals whose gender identity – their innate \nsense of being male or female – differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, which causes \ndistress. \n15.  Gender Dysphoria is a serious medical condition that if left untreated can lead to \nclinical distress, debilitating depression, and even suicidal thoughts and acts. \n16.  At a very young age, G.G. was aware that he did not feel like a girl. \n17.  G.G. has always felt uncomfortable wearing “girl” clothes, and by the age of six, \nhe adamantly refused to do so.  He soon insisted upon buying all of his clothes in the boys’ \ndepartment. \n18.  At approximately age twelve, G.G. acknowledged his male gender identity to \nhimself.  He gradually began disclosing this fact to close friends.  Since the reactions of his \nfriends were generally positive and supportive, he disclosed his gender identity to more friends. \n19.  In approximately ninth grade, most of G.G.’s friends were aware of his gender \nidentity, and G.G. presented himself as a boy when he socialized with them away from home and \nschool. \n20.  During his freshman year, G.G. experienced severe depression and anxiety related \nto his untreated Gender Dysphoria and the stress of concealing his gender identity from his \nfamily.  For this reason, he did not attend school during the spring semester of his freshman year.  \nInstead, he took classes through a home-bound program that follows the public high school \ncurriculum. \n21.  In April 2014, G.G. told his parents that he is transgender.  At his request, he \nbegan to see a psychologist who had experience with working with transgender patients.  The \npsychologist diagnosed him with Gender Dysphoria. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 5 of 16 PageID# 111\n \n22.  Mental health and medical professionals worldwide recognize and follow the \nevidence-based standards of care for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria developed by the World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).After diagnosing G.G. with Gender \nDysphoria, his psychologist developed a course of treatment consistent with those standards.  \nThe goal of treatment is to alleviate distress by helping a person live congruently with the \nperson’s gender identity. \n23.  A critical component of the WPATH Standards of Care is a social transition to \nliving full-time consistently with the individual’s gender identity.  Accordingly, G.G.’s \npsychologist recommended that he immediately begin living in accordance with his gender \nidentity as a boy in all respects.  That included using a male name and pronouns and using boys’ \nrestrooms.  G.G.’s psychologist also provided him a “Treatment Documentation Letter” \nconfirming that he was receiving treatment for Gender Dysphoria and that, as part of that \ntreatment, he should be treated as a boy in all respects, including with respect to his use of the \nrestroom. \n24.  For transgender adolescents, it is critical that the social transition involve full \ntransition at school, including with respect to restrooms.  Excluding a transgender boy from the \nrestroom that corresponds to the student’s gender identity, or forcing the student to use a separate \nfacility from other boys, communicates to the entire school community that he should not be \nrecognized as a boy and undermines the social transition process. \n25.  Based on his psychologist’s recommendation, in July 2014, G.G. petitioned the \nCircuit Court of Gloucester County to change his legal name to G.G., and the court granted the \npetition.  G.G. now uses that name for all purposes, and at his request, his friends and family \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 6 of 16 PageID# 112\n \nrefer to him using male pronouns.  G.G. also uses the boys’ restrooms when out in public, e.g., at \nrestaurants, libraries, shopping centers. \n26.  Also consistent with the WPATH standards of care, G.G.’s psychologist \nrecommended that he see an endocrinologist to begin hormone treatment.  G.G. has been \nreceiving hormone treatment since December 2014.Among other therapeutic benefits, the \nhormone treatment has deepened G.G.’s voice, increased his growth of facial hair, and given him \na more masculine appearance. \n27.  In August 2014, G.G. and his mother informed officials at Gloucester High \nSchool that G.G. is transgender and that he changed his name.  The high school changed G.G.’s \nname in his official school records. \n28.  Before the beginning of the 2014-15 school year, G.G. and his mother met with \nGloucester High School Principal T. Nathan Collins and guidance counselor Tiffany Durr to \ndiscuss G.G.’s treatment for Gender Dysphoria and the need for him to socially transition at \nschool as part of his medical treatment.  Mr. Collins and Ms. Durr both expressed support for \nG.G. and a willingness to ensure a welcoming environment for him at school. Ms. Durr and G.G. \nagreed that G.G. would send an email to teachers explaining that he was to be addressed using \nthe name G.G. and to be referred to using male pronouns.  To the best of G.G.’s knowledge, no \nteachers, administrators, or staff at Gloucester High School expressed any resistance to these \ninstructions. \n29.  G.G. requested, and was permitted, to continue with the home-bound program \nonly for his physical education requirement, while returning to school for the rest of his classes.  \nFor this reason, he has not and does not intend to use a locker room at school. \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 7 of 16 PageID# 113\n \n30.  G.G. initially agreed to use a separate restroom in the nurse’s office because he \nwas unsure how other students would react to his transition. \n31.  When the 2014-15 school year began, G.G. was pleased to discover that his \nteachers and the vast majority of his peers respected the fact that he is a boy and treated him \naccordingly.  G.G. quickly determined that it was not necessary for his safety to continue to use \nthe nurse’s bathroom, and he found it stigmatizing to have to use a separate restroom.  The \nnurse’s bathroom was also very inconvenient to G.G.’s classrooms, making it difficult to use the \nrestroom between classes.  For these reasons, G.G. asked Mr. Collins to be allowed to use the \nboys’ bathrooms. \n32.  On or about October 20, 2014, Mr. Collins agreed that G.G. could use the boys’ \nrestrooms.  For approximately the next seven weeks, G.G. used the boys’ restrooms without \nincident. \n33.  Nevertheless, some adults in the community were angered when they came to \nlearn that a transgender student had been allowed to use the restroom corresponding to the \nstudent’s gender identity. Upon information and belief, those adults contacted members of the \nSchool Board to demand that the transgender student be barred from continuing to use the \nrestroom at issue. \n34.  Shortly before the School Board’s meeting on November 11, 2014, Board \nmember Carla B. Hook added an item to the agenda titled “Discussion of Use of \nRestrooms/Locker Room Facilities.”  In advance of the meeting, Ms. Hook prepared to submit \nthe following proposed resolution (hereinafter referred to as the “transgender restroom policy”): \nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and \n \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, and  \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 8 of 16 PageID# 114\n \n \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \n \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room \nfacilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding \nbiological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an \nalternative appropriate private facility. \n \n35.  Through emails and online message boards, news circulated among certain \nGloucester County residents that they should attend the School Board meeting on November 11, \n2014, and speak in favor of Ms. Hook’s proposed restroom policy. \n36.  Neither G.G. nor his parents were informed by the School Board or any other \nschool officials that the School Board would be considering a policy that would bar G.G. from \nusing the boys’ restroom.  G.G. and his parents learned about the proposal for the first time on \nNovember 10 – the day before the School Board meeting was scheduled to take place – when \nthey saw one of the messages posted by supporters of Ms. Hook’s proposed restroom policy. \n37.  Twenty-seven people spoke during the Citizens’ Comment Period of the School \nBoard meeting, the majority of whom opposed the school’s decision to allow G.G. to use the \nboys’ restrooms.  The commenters displayed many misperceptions about transgender people and \nimagined dire consequences from allowing G.G. to use the boys’ restrooms.  Some speakers \nreferred to G.G. as a “young lady.”Some speakers claimed that transgender students’ use of \nrestrooms that match their gender identity would violate the privacy of other students and would \nlead to sexual assault in bathrooms. Another suggested that boys who are not transgender would \ncome to school wearing a dress and demand to use the girls’ restroom for nefarious purposes. \n38.  G.G. and his parents also attended the meeting to speak against the policy.  In \ndoing so, G.G. was forced to identify himself to the entire community, including local press \ncovering the meeting, as the transgender student whose restroom use was at issue.  “All I want to \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 9 of 16 PageID# 115\n \ndo is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace,” G.G. said.  “I did not ask to be this way, \nand it’s one of the most difficult things anyone can face,” he continued.  “This could be your \nchild . . . . I’m just a human. I’m just a boy.” \n39.  Later in the meeting, Board member Carla B. Hook moved to adopt her proposed \ntransgender restroom policy.  By a vote of 4-3, the School Board voted to defer a vote on the \npolicy until its meeting on December 9, 2014. \n40.  Between November 11, 2014, and December 9, 2014, the School Board was \ninformed by many legal sources that the proposed restroom policy conflicted with guidance of \nthe Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) regarding Title IX and that adopting \nthe policy would place the district’s Title IX funding at risk.  According to OCR guidance, \ntransgender students are protected under Title IX from discrimination based on gender identity or \ngender nonconformity, and schools must respect students’ gender identity for purposes of any \nsex-segregated programming. See U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, \nQuestions & Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and \nExtracurricular Activities (Dec. 1, 2014); U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, \nQuestions & Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (Apr. 29, 2014). \n41.   On December 3, 2014, the School Board issued a news release stating that \nregardless of the outcome of the upcoming meeting, the School Board intended to take measures \nto increase privacy in student bathrooms. According to the release: \nOne positive outcome of all the discussion is that the District is planning to increase the \nprivacy options for all students using school restrooms . . . Plans include adding or \nexpanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, and adding privacy strips to the \ndoors of stalls in all restrooms. The District also plans to designate single-stall, unisex \nrestrooms, similar to what’s in many other public spaces, to give all students the option \nfor even greater privacy. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 10 of 16 PageID# 116\n \n42.  At the School Board’s December 9, 2014 meeting, approximately 37 people \nspoke during the Citizens’ Comment Period.  The majority of speakers opposed G.G.’s use of the \nboys’ restrooms.  Several speakers threatened to vote the School Board members out of office if \nthey did not adopt the transgender restroom policy.  Speakers again suggested that permitting \nG.G. to use the boys’ bathroom would violate the privacy of other students, notwithstanding the \nSchool Board’s announcement that bathrooms would be modified to allow more privacy. Some \nspeakers said that allowing G.G. to use the boys’ bathroom would make the bathrooms “coed.”  \nSpeakers again referred to G.G. as a “girl” or “young lady.”  One speaker called him a “freak” \nand compared him to a person who thinks he is a “dog” and wants to urinate on fire hydrants. \n43.  Following the Citizens’ Comment Period, the School Board voted 6-1 to pass the \ntransgender restroom policy. \n44.  The experience of having the entire community discuss his physical anatomy and \ndebate where he should use the restroom and has been profoundly disturbing for G.G..  He feels \nthat he has been stripped of his privacy and turned into a public spectacle. \n45.  The day after the School Board adopted the transgender restroom policy, Mr. \nCollins informed G.G. that he would no longer be allowed to use the boys’ restrooms and that \nthere would be disciplinary consequences if he tried to do so. \n46.  Using the girls’ restroom is not possible for G.G.  Even before he began treatment \nfor Gender Dysphoria, girls and women who encountered G.G. in female restrooms reacted \nnegatively because they perceived G.G. to be a boy.  For example, when G.G. was in eighth and \nninth grade, girls would tell him “this is the girls’ room” and ask tell him to leave.  G.G.’s \nappearance now is even more masculine.  In addition to those practical obstacles, using the girls’ \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 11 of 16 PageID# 117\n \nrestroom would cause severe psychological distress to G.G. and would be incompatible with his \nmedically necessary treatment for Gender Dysphoria. \n47.  Since adopting the restroom policy, three unisex, single-stall restrooms have been \ninstalled at Gloucester High School.  The school also raised the doors and walls around the \nbathroom stalls so that students cannot see into an adjoining stall.  Additionally, the high school \ninstalled partitions between urinals in the boys’ bathrooms.  As a result, a person making normal \nuse of the restroom cannot see the genitals of any other person. \n48.  G.G. refuses to use the separate single-stall restrooms they make him feel even \nmore stigmatized and isolated than when he used the restroom in the nurse’s office.  Being \nrequired to use the separate restrooms sets him apart from his peers, and serves as a daily \nreminder that the school views him as “different.”  Other students do not appear to use the \nsingle-stall unisex restrooms.  The entire school community knows that they were installed as \nrestrooms for G.G., and any other transgender students, so they would not be in the same \nrestroom as their peers. \n49.  Instead of using the separate restrooms, G.G. tries to avoid using the restrooms \nentirely while at school, and, if that is not possible, he uses the nurse’s restroom.  As a result of \ntrying to avoid using the restroom, G.G. has repeatedly developed painful urinary tract \ninfections.  He limits his beverage intake to try to reduce the discomfort and distraction caused \nby “holding it” as he tries to focus in class.  \n50.  Because the powerful stigma attached to the requirement that he use separate \nrestrooms, and because the exclusion from the boys’ restrooms undermines his social transition \nprocess, the transgender restroom policy inflicts severe and persistent emotional and social \nharms on G.G.  Research indicates that transgender students are at greater risk than their peers of \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 12 of 16 PageID# 118\n \nexperiencing severe and long-term negative effects from being stigmatized by and isolated from \ntheir peers.  The transgender restroom policy compounds that harm and imposes additional \nstigma on an already vulnerable group of students. \n51.  Randi Ettner Ph.D – a psychologist and nationally recognized expert in the \ntreatment of Gender Dysphoria in children and adolescents – recently conducted an independent \nclinical assessment of G.G. and concluded that “the shame of being singled out and stigmatized \nin his daily life every time he needs to use the restroom is a devastating blow to G.G. and places \nhim at extreme risk for immediate and long-term psychological harm.” \n52.  By contrast, allowing G.G. to use the boys’ restroom would not harm any other \nstudent at Gloucester High School in any way.  There is no indication that any student was \nharmed during the seven weeks that G.G. used the boys’ restrooms.  The privacy modifications \nmade to the restrooms address the already far-fetched concern that G.G. might see the genitals of \nanother boy while using the restroom.  Any boy who still feels uncomfortable with using the \nrestroom at the same time as G.G. may avail himself of the recently installed single stall \nbathrooms.  But the School Board may not place the burden solely on transgender students to use \nseparate restroom facilities to address the alleged discomfort of others. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n53.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination \nbased on gender is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny.  The \nFourteenth Amendment’s protections from discrimination based on gender encompass both \ndiscrimination based on the biological differences between men and women and discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity. \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 13 of 16 PageID# 119\n \n54.  The School Board is the final policymaker for Gloucester County Public Schools. \n55.  By requiring G.G. – a transgender boy – to use separate restrooms because of his \n“gender identity issues,” the School Board, under color of state law, has treated and continues to \ntreat G.G. differently from similarly situated students based on his gender. \n56.  By excluding G.G. – a transgender boy – from the boys’ restrooms because the \nSchool Board does not deem him to be “biologically” male, the School Board, under color of \nstate law, has treated and continues to treat G.G. differently from similarly situated students \nbased on his gender. \n57.  The School Board’s discrimination against G.G. based on his gender is not \nsubstantially related to any important government interest. \n58.  The School Board’s discrimination against G.G. based on his gender is not \nrationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n59.  The School Board’s discrimination against G.G. based on his gender denies him \nthe equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n60.  The School Board is liable for its violation of G.G.’s Fourteenth Amendment \nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n \nCOUNT II \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n \n61.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM   Document 8   Filed 06/11/15   Page 14 of 16 PageID# 120\n \n62.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” encompasses both \ndiscrimination based on biological differences between men and women and discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity. \n63.  Gloucester County Public Schools and Gloucester High School are education \nprograms receiving Federal financial assistance. \n64.  By requiring G.G. – a transgender boy – to use separate restrooms because of his \n“gender identity issues,” the School Board has and continues to exclude G.G. from participation \nin, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to discrimination in educational programs and \nactivities at Gloucester County Public Schools and Gloucester High School “on the basis of sex,” \nwhich violates G.G.’s rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § \n1681, et seq. \n65.   By excluding G.G. – a transgender boy – from the boys’ restrooms because the \nSchool Board does not deem him to be “biologically” male,  the School Board has and continues \nto exclude G.G. from participation in, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to discrimination \nin educational programs and activities at Gloucester County Public Schools and Gloucester High \nSchool “on the basis of sex,” which violates G.G.’s rights under Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA.

Gavin Grimm (“Gavin”) is an 18-year-old young man who is transgender. When \nGavin was 15, he came out to his family as a boy and, with the help of his medical providers, \ntransitioned to living in accordance with his male identity as part of medically necessary \ntreatment for gender dysphoria.  \n2.  By the time Gavin began his sophomore year at Gloucester High School, he had \nlegally changed his name to Gavin and begun using male pronouns. Gavin wore his clothing and \nhairstyles in a manner typical of other boys and used the men’s restrooms in public venues, \nincluding restaurants, libraries, and shopping centers, without encountering any problems. \nGavin’s medical providers also gave him a “treatment documentation letter,” which confirmed \nthat Gavin was receiving treatment for gender dysphoria and stated that he should be treated as a \nboy in all respects, including when using the restroom.  \n3.  With the support of the school principal and superintendent, Gavin used the boys’ \nrestrooms at Gloucester High School for approximately seven weeks without incident.  \n1 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 2 of 17 PageID# 1029\n4.  But in response to complaints from some adults in the community, the Gloucester \nCounty School Board (the “Board”) overruled its own administrators and enacted a new policy \nprohibiting boys and girls “with gender identity issues” from using the same restrooms as other \nboys and girls. The new policy directed transgender students to an “alternative appropriate \nprivate facility.”  \n5.  The Board continued to exclude Gavin from using the same restrooms as other \nboys, even after he began receiving hormone therapy, obtained a Virginia state I.D. card listing \nhis sex as male, underwent chest reconstruction surgery, obtained a court order legally changing \nhis sex to male under Virginia law, and received a new Virginia birth certificate reflecting that \nhis sex is male. \n6.  Throughout the rest of high school, Gavin was forced to use separate restrooms \nthat no other student was required to use. That degrading and stigmatizing policy singled Gavin \nout as unfit to use the same restrooms that are available to every other student. \n7.  The Board’s policy conflicts with the views of every major medical and mental \nhealth organization and school counselors, teachers, and administrators across the country.  \n8.  In every part of the country, including Virginia, boys and girls who are \ntransgender are already using sex-separated restroom and locker room facilities at school, \nparticipating in interscholastic athletic teams in both high school and college, and joining girl-\nscout and boy-scout troops.  \n9.  Ignoring these realities, the Gloucester County School Board has adhered to its \ncategorical ban, which prohibits the Board’s own school administrators from ever allowing any \ntransgender student to use the common facilities that are available to every other boy and girl.  \n2 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 3 of 17 PageID# 1030\n10.  Gavin is recognized by his family, his medical providers, the Virginia Department \nof Health, and the world at large as a boy. Allowing him to use the same restrooms as other boys \nis the only way to provide him access to sex-separated restrooms without discrimination.  \n11.  By segregating Gavin from his peers, excluding him from using the same \nrestrooms that every other boy is allowed to use, and relegating him to separate restroom \nfacilities, the Board has discriminated against Gavin—and continues to discriminate against him, \nin violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972. Gavin seeks redress from this Court. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This action arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681, et seq., the Constitution of the United States, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nDeclaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n13.  Venue lies with this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1)-(2), because the \ndefendant resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Gavin Grimm (“Gavin”) is eighteen years old. From September 2013 to \nJune 2017, he attended Gloucester High School, a public high school in Gloucester County, \nVirginia.  \n15.  The Gloucester County School Board (the “School Board” or “Board”) is an \nelected body responsible for the operation of the Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”), \n3 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 4 of 17 PageID# 1031\nincluding the promulgation of policies. At all times relevant, the School Board has acted and \ncontinues to act under color of state law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nTransgender youth and gender dysphoria \n16.  Gavin was born in Gloucester County and has lived in Gloucester County his \nentire life. Gavin is a typical teenager who is articulate and intelligent, reads broadly, loves his \ndog and cats, and enjoys hanging out with his friends.  \n17.  When Gavin was born, the hospital staff identified him as female, but from a \nyoung age, Gavin knew that he was a boy. Although the sex assigned to Gavin at birth was \nfemale, Gavin has a male gender identity. \n18.   Everyone has a gender identity. It is an established medical concept, referring to \na person’s deeply felt, inherent sense of being a boy, a man, or male; a girl, a woman, or female. \nMost people have a gender identity that matches the sex they are identified as at birth. But people \nwho are transgender have a gender identity that differs from the sex they are assigned at birth.  \n19.  Like many transgender students, Gavin succeeded at school until the onset of \npuberty, when he began to suffer debilitating levels of distress from gender dysphoria, a \ncondition in which transgender individuals experience persistent and clinically significant \ndistress caused by the incongruence between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at \nbirth. Although gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition recognized by the American \nPsychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013), \nbeing transgender is not a mental disorder and “implies no impairment in judgment, stability, \nreliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.” Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Position \n4 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 5 of 17 PageID# 1032\nStatement on Discrimination Against Transgender & Gender Variant Individuals (2012), at \nhttps://goo.gl/iXBM0S. \n20.  There is a medical and scientific consensus that the treatment for gender \ndysphoria is for boys who are transgender to live as boys and for girls who are transgender to \nlive as girls. When medically appropriate, treatment also includes hormone therapy and surgery. \nThis medical consensus is embraced by the American Medical Association, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the National Endocrine Society, and every other major medical and mental health \norganization in the United States. \n21.  The ability of transgender individuals to live consistently with their identity is \ncritical to their health and well-being. That includes using names and pronouns consistent with \ntheir identity, grooming and dressing in a manner typically associated with that gender, and using \nrestrooms and other sex-separated facilities that match their gender identity. Preventing \ntransgender students from living in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity puts \nthem at increased risk of debilitating depression and suicide. By contrast, when gender dysphoria \nis properly treated, transgender individuals experience profound relief and can go on to lead \nhealthy, happy, and successful lives. \n22.  Boys and girls who are transgender are people who consistently, persistently, and \ninsistently do not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth, and who can experience the \ndebilitating distress of gender dysphoria when they are not able to live as the boys and girls that \nthey are. The gender identity of these adolescents is stable and fixed.  \n23.  Boys and girls who are transgender are attending schools across the country. \nWhile transgender students have long been part of school communities, it is only in the last \n5 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 6 of 17 PageID# 1033\ncouple decades that there has been more widespread access to the medical and psychological \nsupport that they need. Beginning in the early 2000s, as a result of advances in medical and \npsychological treatment for transgender youth, transgender students finally began to receive the \ntreatment necessary to alleviate the devastating pain of gender dysphoria and live their lives in \naccordance with who they really are.  \n24.  Many transgender students attend school without classmates and peers knowing \nthey are transgender. For example, many students have already transitioned before beginning \nschool and many others transfer to a new school after transitioning.  \n25.  With hormone therapy, transgender students develop physical sex characteristics \ntypical of their gender identity—not the sex they were identified as at birth. Hormone therapy \naffects bone and muscle structure, alters the appearance of a person’s genitals, and produces \nsecondary sex characteristics such as facial and body hair in boys and breasts in girls.  \n26.  In addition, transgender children who receive puberty blockers never go through \npuberty as their birth-designated sex. They will be exposed to the same levels of testosterone or \nestrogen as other boys and girls during puberty, and those hormones will affect every major body \nsystem.  \n27.  Under widely accepted standards of care developed by the World Professional \nAssociation of Transgender Health (“WPATH”), genital surgery is not recommended for minors, \nbut boys who are transgender may undergo medically necessary chest-reconstruction surgery \nafter they turn 16.  \n28.  According to every major medical and mental health organization, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, and the American Psychological Association, excluding boys and girls who are \n6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 7 of 17 PageID# 1034\ntransgender from using the same restrooms as other boys and girls is harmful to their health and \nwellbeing. When excluded from the common restrooms, transgender students often avoid using \nthe restroom entirely, either because the separate restrooms are too stigmatizing or too difficult \nto access. They suffer infections and other negative health consequences as a result of avoiding \nrestroom use. The exclusion also increases their risk of depression and self-harm. \n29.  Educators and school administrators across the country also recognize that \nexcluding transgender boys and girls from using the common restrooms interferes with their \nability to learn and thrive at school. It impairs their ability to develop a healthy sense of self, peer \nrelationships, and the cognitive skills necessary to succeed in adult life. In light of these harms, \nthe National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, National Association of Elementary School Principals, and the American School \nCounselor Association have all called upon schools to allow boys and girls who are transgender \nto use the same restrooms as other boys and girls. \n30.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and \nmental health organizations, there is no evidence that allowing boys and girls who are \ntransgender to use the same restrooms as other boys and girls causes any harm to the physical or \nmental health of students who are not transgender. \n31.  Schools can provide accommodations for all students—whether transgender or \nnot—to enhance their own privacy without discriminating against transgender students by \nexcluding them from common spaces. \n32.  In schools across the country, including Virginia, transgender boys and girls \nalready use the same restrooms and locker rooms as other boys and girls \n7 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 8 of 17 PageID# 1035\n33.  In high school athletic associations across the country, including Virginia, \ntransgender boys and girls already play on the same sports teams as other boys and girls.  \n34.  Institutions ranging from the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts to the Seven Sisters \ncolleges to the National Collegiate Athletic Association already recognize boys who are \ntransgender as boys and recognize girls who are transgender as girls.  \n35.  Treating boys who are transgender as boys, and treating girls who are transgender \nas girls, is the only way they can equally participate in school, work, or society at large. \nGavin’s experience at Gloucester High School  \n36.  In 2014, near the end of his first year of high school, the distress caused by \nGavin’s untreated gender dysphoria became so great that he was unable to attend class. At that \npoint, Gavin came out to his parents as a boy and, at his request, began seeing a psychologist \nwith experience counseling transgender youth.  \n37.  With the help of his medical providers, Gavin transitioned to living in accordance \nwith his male identity as part of medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.  \n38.  Gavin legally changed his name to Gavin and began using male pronouns. Gavin \nwore his clothing and hairstyles in a manner typical of other boys and began using the men’s \nrestrooms in public venues, including restaurants, libraries, and shopping centers, without \nencountering any problems. His medical providers also referred Gavin to an endocrinologist to \nbegin hormone therapy. \n39.  Gavin and his mother met with the school principal and guidance counselor in \nAugust 2014, before the beginning of his sophomore year, to explain that Gavin is a boy who is \ntransgender and would be attending school as a boy.  \n8 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 9 of 17 PageID# 1036\n40.  Gavin and his mother gave the school principal and guidance counselor a \n“treatment documentation letter” from his psychologist, which confirmed that Gavin was \nreceiving treatment for gender dysphoria and stated that he should be treated as a boy in all \nrespects, including when using the restroom.  \n41.  At the time Gavin and his mother met with the school principal and guidance \ncounselor, the School Board did not have policies addressing which restrooms transgender \nstudents should use.  \n42.  Gavin initially requested to use the restroom in the nurse’s office, but he soon felt \nstigmatized and isolated using a different restroom from everyone else. The restroom in the \nnurse’s office was also located far away from many of his school classes, and Gavin was often \nunable to use the restroom without being late for class.  \n43.  After a few weeks of using the restroom in the nurse’s office, Gavin sought \npermission to use the boys’ restrooms.  \n44.  On October 20, 2014, with the principal’s support, Gavin began using the boys’ \nrestrooms, and did so for seven weeks without incident. \n45.  Gavin also requested permission to complete his physical-education requirements \nthrough a home-bound program. As a result, he never needed to use the locker rooms at school. \n46.  The principal of Gloucester High School and the superintendent of Gloucester \nCounty Public Schools informed the Board that they had authorized Gavin to use the same \nrestrooms as other boys, but otherwise kept the matter confidential.  \n47.  Although the principal and superintendent treated the matter as confidential, some \nadults in the community learned that a boy who is transgender was using the boys’ restrooms at \n9 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 10 of 17 PageID# 1037\nGloucester High School. They contacted the Board to demand that the transgender student (who \nwas not publicly identified as Gavin until later) be barred from the boys’ restrooms. \n48.  The Board has not disclosed the nature or source of the complaints it received. \n49.  On information and belief, at least some of the complaints came from a \nGloucester High School employee who runs the school Bible club and is a pastor at a local \nchurch. That employee told the Washington Post that he spoke out against Gavin’s use of the \nboys’ restroom because “God puts us on this Earth as who we are.” \n50.  The Board considered the matter at a private meeting and took no action for \nseveral weeks.  \n51.  Unsatisfied with the results of the private meeting, one member of the Board \nalerted the broader community by proposing the following policy for public debate at the \nBoard’s meeting on November 11, 2014:  \nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and \n \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, and  \n \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \n \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room \nfacilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding \nbiological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an \nalternative appropriate private facility. \n \n52.  The policy categorically prohibits administrators from allowing any boy who is \ntransgender to use any boys’ restroom (or allowing any girl who is transgender to use any girls’ \nrestroom) in any school within the Gloucester County School District, regardless of the student’s \nindividual circumstances.  \n10 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 11 of 17 PageID# 1038\n53.  The policy does not define “biological gender,” and the term has no common or \naccepted meaning. There are many biological components of sex, including chromosomal, \nanatomical, hormonal, and reproductive elements, some of which could be ambiguous or in \nconflict within an individual, either because that individual has intersex traits or because that \nindividual has undergone medical care for gender dysphoria.  \n54.  After learning about the meeting through social media, Gavin and his parents \ndecided to speak against the proposed policy. In order to speak against the policy, Gavin was \nforced to reveal himself to the entire community and the local media as the boy whose restroom \nuse was at issue. \n55.  Gavin told the Board:  \nI use the public restroom, the men’s public restroom, in every public space in \nGloucester County and others. I have never once had any sort of confrontation of \nany kind. \n… \nAll I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace, and I have had \nno problems from students to do that—only from adults. \n… \nI did not ask to be this way, and it’s one of the most difficult things anyone can \nface.  \n… \nI am just a human. I am just a boy. \n \nA recording of his remarks can be viewed online at https://goo.gl/CYh4gd \n56.  By a vote of 4-3, the School Board voted to defer a vote on the policy until its \nmeeting on December 9, 2014. \n57.  Before its next meeting, the Board issued a press release announcing plans for \n“adding or expanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, and adding privacy strips to \nthe doors of stalls in all restrooms.” In addition, the press release announced “plans to designate \nsingle stall, unisex restrooms … to give all students the option for even greater privacy.”  \n11 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 12 of 17 PageID# 1039\n58.  Speakers at the December 9, 2014 Board meeting nonetheless demanded that \nGavin be excluded from the boys’ restrooms immediately, and many threatened to vote Board \nmembers out of office if they refused to pass the new policy. \n59.  With Gavin in attendance, several speakers pointedly referred to him as a “young \nlady.” One speaker called Gavin a “freak” and compared him to a person who thinks he is a \n“dog” and wants to urinate on fire hydrants. “Put him in a separate bathroom if that’s what it’s \ngoing to take,” said another. \n60.  The Board meeting made Gavin feel that he had been turned into a public \nspectacle in front of the entire community.  \n61.  The Board passed the policy on December 9, 2014, by a 6-1 vote. \n62.  The following day, the principal told Gavin he could no longer use the same \nrestrooms as other boys. \n63.  The Board’s new policy did not affect the restroom usage of any other student at \nGloucester High School. Every other student was allowed to continue using the same restrooms \nthey had been using before the new policy was adopted. The only person who had to use a \ndifferent restroom was Gavin. \n64.  The Board subsequently installed three single-user restrooms. One of the \nrestrooms had previously been designated as a restroom for teachers and staff. The other two \nrestrooms were converted from old utility closets.  \n65.  None of the single-user restrooms was located near Gavin’s classes. \n66.  Although any student was allowed to use the single-user restrooms, no one else \ndid so. Everyone knew they were created for Gavin as part of the policy prohibiting him from \nusing the same restrooms as other boys. \n12 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 13 of 17 PageID# 1040\n67.   Being relegated to the separate restrooms was demeaning and shameful for \nGavin. It signaled to Gavin and the entire school community that he is different, and it sent a \npublic message to all his peers that he is not fit to be treated like everyone else.  \n68.  Gavin did everything he could to avoid using the restroom at school. As a result, \nhe developed painful urinary tract infections and was often distracted and uncomfortable in class. \n69.  When Gavin absolutely had to use the restroom, he used the nurse’s restroom, but \nhe still felt ashamed doing so. Every time he had to walk to the other side of school to use the \nnurse’s restroom, Gavin felt like he was taking a “walk of shame.” It was a constant reminder to \nGavin—and to anyone who saw him—that Gavin is transgender and had been barred from using \nthe same restrooms as other boys. \n70.  Being excluded from the common boys’ restroom and forced to use separate \nrestroom facilities also physically isolated Gavin from the rest of his peers by requiring him to \ntravel to a separate part of the school if he had to use the restroom between classes.  \n71.  When Gavin attended school football games, there was no restroom for him to use \nat all. The Gloucester High School building was locked after school, and there are no single-user \nrestroom facilities in the stadium. When he had to use the restroom, Gavin’s only option was to \ncall his mother to pick him up and take him home early. \nEnforcement of the policy  \n \n72.  The Board continued to exclude Gavin from the same restrooms as other boys \nthroughout the remainder of his sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. \n73.  In December 2014, Gavin began hormone therapy, which has altered his bone and \nmuscle structure, deepened his voice, and caused him to grow facial hair.  \n13 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 14 of 17 PageID# 1041\n74.  In June 2015, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued Gavin a state \nI.D. card identifying him as male.  \n75.  In June 2016, Gavin underwent chest-reconstruction surgery, in accordance with \nthe medical standards of care for treating gender dysphoria. \n76.  On September 9, 2016, the Gloucester County Circuit Court issued an order \nchanging Gavin’s sex under Virginia state law and directing the Virginia Department of Health \nto issue Gavin a birth certificate listing his sex as male.  \n77.  On October 27, 2016, the Virginia Department of Health issued Gavin a birth \nlisting his sex as male. \n78.  Despite all of this, the Board disregarded Gavin’s medical treatment, his Virginia \nI.D. card, his new Virginia birth certificate, and the court order changing his sex under Virginia \nstate law. The Board maintained that Gavin’s “biological gender” remains female and continued \nto prohibit its administrators from allowing Gavin to use the boys’ restrooms. \n79.  Gavin graduated high school on June 10, 2017. \n80.  As an alumnus with close ties to the community, Gavin will continue to be on \nschool grounds when attending football games, alumni activities, or social event with friends \nwho are still in high school. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n81.  The Board is the final policymaker for Gloucester County Public Schools, acting \nunder color of state law. \n82.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board has treated, and \n14 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 15 of 17 PageID# 1042\ncontinues to treat, Gavin differently from similarly situated students in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n83.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board has discriminated, \nand continues to discriminate, against Gavin on the basis of gender, which is subject to \nheightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. \n84.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board has discriminated, \nand continues to discriminate, against Gavin on the basis of transgender status, which is also \nsubject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  \na.  Transgender people as a class have historically been subject to discrimination. \nb.  Transgender people as a class have a defining characteristic that frequently bears \nno relation to an ability to perform or contribute to society. \nc.  Transgender people as a class exhibit immutable or distinguishing characteristics \nthat define them as a discrete group. \nd.  Transgender people as a class are a minority with relatively little political power. \n85.  By excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is \nallowed to use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities, the Board has discriminated, \nand continues to discriminate, against Gavin based on invidious stereotypes, moral disapproval, \nand unfounded fears about people who are different. \n86.  The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not narrowly tailored to advance a \ncompelling government interest. \n15 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 16 of 17 PageID# 1043\n87.  The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not substantially related to any \nimportant government interest. \n88.  The Board’s discrimination against Gavin is not rationally related to any \nlegitimate government interest. \n89.  The Board is liable for its violation of Gavin’s Fourteenth Amendment rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \nCOUNT II \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n \n90.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). \n91.  Gloucester County Public Schools and Gloucester High School are education \nprograms receiving Federal financial assistance.  \n92.  Excluding Gavin from using the same restrooms that every other boy is allowed \nto use and relegating him to separate restroom facilities violates his rights under Title IX by \nexcluding him from participation in, denying him the benefits of, and subjecting him to \ndiscrimination in educational programs and activities at Gloucester County Public Schools and \nGloucester High School “on the basis of sex.” \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \n16 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 113   Filed 08/22/17   Page 17 of 17 PageID# 1044\nA.

He explained that he is a person worthy of \ndignity and privacy.  He explained why it is humiliating to be segregated from the general \npopulation.  He knew, intuitively, what the law has in recent decades acknowledged: the \nperpetuation of stereotypes is one of many forms of invidious discrimination.  And so he \nhoped that his heartfelt explanation would help the powerful adults in his community come \nto understand what his adolescent peers already did.  G.G. clearly and eloquently attested \nthat he was not a predator, but a boy, despite the fact that he did not conform to some \npeople’s idea about who is a boy.1   \nRegrettably, a majority of the School Board was unpersuaded.  And so we come to \nthis moment.  High school graduation looms and, by this court’s order vacating the \npreliminary injunction, G.G.’s banishment from the boys’ restroom becomes an enduring \nfeature of his high school experience.  Would that courtesies extended to others had been \nextended to G.G. \n                                              \n1 Footage of his compelling statement to the School Board is available at: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0GYq_Wydw&feature=youtu.be. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 93   Filed 04/07/17   Page 3 of 5 PageID# 951\nOur country has a long and ignominious history of discriminating against our most \nvulnerable  and  powerless.    We  have  an  equally  long  history,  however,  of  brave \nindividuals—Dred Scott, Fred Korematsu, Linda Brown, Mildred and Richard Loving, \nEdie Windsor, and Jim Obergefell, to name just a few—who refused to accept quietly the \ninjustices that were perpetuated against them.  It is unsurprising, of course, that the burden \nof confronting and remedying injustice falls on the shoulders of the oppressed.  These \nindividuals looked to the federal courts to vindicate their claims to human dignity, but as \nthe names listed above make clear, the judiciary’s response has been decidedly mixed.  \nToday, G.G. adds his name to the list of plaintiffs whose struggle for justice has been \ndelayed and rebuffed; as Dr. King reminded us, however, “the arc of the moral universe is \nlong, but it bends toward justice.”  G.G.’s journey is delayed but not finished. \nG.G.’s case is about much more than bathrooms.  It’s about a boy asking his school \nto treat him just like any other boy.  It’s about protecting the rights of transgender people \nin public spaces and not forcing them to exist on the margins.  It’s about governmental \nvalidation of the existence and experiences of transgender people, as well as the simple \nrecognition of their humanity.  His case is part of a larger movement that is redefining and \nbroadening the scope of civil and human rights so that they extend to a vulnerable group \nthat has traditionally been unrecognized, unrepresented, and unprotected.   \nG.G.’s plight has shown us the inequities that arise when the government organizes \nsociety  by  outdated  constructs  like  biological  sex  and  gender.    Fortunately,  the  law \neventually catches up to the lived facts of people; indeed, the record shows that the \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 93   Filed 04/07/17   Page 4 of 5 PageID# 952\nCommonwealth of Virginia has now recorded a birth certificate for G.G. that designates \nhis sex as male.   \nG.G.’s lawsuit also has demonstrated that some entities will not protect the rights of \nothers unless compelled to do so.  Today, hatred, intolerance, and discrimination persist — \nand are sometimes even promoted — but by challenging unjust policies rooted in invidious \ndiscrimination, G.G. takes his place among other modern-day human rights leaders who \nstrive to ensure that, one day, equality will prevail, and that the core dignity of every one \nof our brothers and sisters is respected by lawmakers and others who wield power over \ntheir lives. \n  G.G. is and will be famous, and justifiably so.  But he is not “famous” in the \nhollowed-out Hollywood sense of the term.  He is famous for the reasons celebrated by the \nrenowned Palestinian-American poet Naomi Shehab Nye, in her extraordinary poem, \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM   Document 93   Filed 04/07/17   Page 5 of 5 PageID# 953\nFamous.

ECF Nos. 125, 126. For the reasons stated herein, the Court dismisses Requests for\nRelief(C) and (D) in the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 113 at 17), and vacates its October 26,\n2017 Orderdirecting Supplemental Briefing (ECF No. 123).\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe Court has recounted the procedural history ofthis case. See ECF No. 123 at 1-2.'\nOn August 22, 2017, Plaintifffiled an Amended Complaint, alleging claims under Title IX ofthe\n' Plaintiff Gavin Grimm, a transgender male teenager, commenced this action against the\nGloucester County School Board in July 2015, alleging that the School Board's policy of assigning\nstudents to restrooms based on their biological sex violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) and the Equal Protection Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. In September 2015, anotherjudge ofthis Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and\nOrder that (1) dismissed Grimm's claim under Title IX for failure to state a claim, and (2) denied his\nMotion for a Preliminaiy Injunction based on alleged violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection\nClause. G.G. exrei Grimm v. Ghucesfer Oy. Sch. Bd, 132F.Supp. 3d 736, 753 (E.D. Va. 2015).\nAn interlocutory appeal ofthose decisions followed, which led to an appellate review process by\nthe United States Court ofAppeals for the Fourth Circuitand the United States Supreme Court that lasted\nnearly two years. Grimm v. Gloucester Cly. Sch. Bd., No. 15-2056, slip op. at 5-6 (4th Cir. Aug. 2,\n2017). During this time, the district court case was re-assigned to the undersigned. In August 2017, the\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 132   Filed 12/12/17   Page 2 of 6 PageID# 1251\nEducationAmendmentsof 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and underthe EqualProtectionClauseof\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. ECFNo. 113. The Amended Complaintsought:(1) a retrospective\ndeclaratory judgment and nominal damages, and (2) a prospective declaratory judgment and\npermanent injunctive relief. Id. at 17. Subsequently, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss\npursuantto Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 12(b)(6). ECF No. 118.\nAfter the parties briefed the Motion to Dismiss, this Court issued an Order advising the\nparties that Plaintiffs graduation from high school raised threshold jurisdictional issues related\nto mootness. The Court further advised the parties that to the extent that the Motion to Dismiss\nquestioned whether the case still presented a justiciable controversy, the Court would construe\nthe Motion to Dismiss as brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). The Court then ordered\nsupplemental briefing regarding mootness. ECF No. 123. In response to the Court's Order,\nPlaintifffiled the Motions currentlybefore the Court.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. PlaintiffsNotice ofConsentto Dismissal ofRequests for ReliefTC^and CD)\nWith respect to Plaintiffs Notice of Consent to DismissalofRequests for Relief (C) and\n(D), Plaintiff has advised the Court that \"[cjontinuing to pursue claims for prospective\nFourthCircuitwasagainpresentedwiththeparties' originalappealoftheSeptember2015Memorandum\nOpinion and Order. Id. at6.\nDuring the pendencyof the appeal, a potential mootness issue arose when Plaintiff graduated\nfrom high school. On August 2, 2017, the Fourth Circuit issued an Order remanding the case to this\nCourt for a findingon the question ofmootnessandto develop a factual recordonthis issue. Id. at 6-8.\nThis Court ordered the parties to submit a Joint Position Statement proposing procedures for developing\nthisfactualrecordandconductingproceedingsonremand. ECFNo. 108.\nIntheir Joint Position Statement, the partiesadvised that they had filed a stipulation tovoluntarily\ndismiss Plaintiffs interlocutory appeal regarding the Preliminary Injunction. ECFNo. 111. Because of\nthis, they believed that \"there will be no need for additional fact-finding to determine whetherthe motion\nfor preliminary injunction has become moot.\" Id. Instead, parties proposed that this Court grant\nPlaintiffs Motion to Amend the Complaint and set a schedule allowing Defendant to file a motion to\ndismiss. ECF Nos. 109, 111. This Court considered the Joint Position Statement, the record, and the\nhistory ofthe litigation, and granted the Consent Motion, allowing the parties to proceed with briefing in\naccordancewith their proposed schedule. ECFNo. 112.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 132   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 6 PageID# 1252\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief would require the parties and the court to expend time and\nresources resolving factual questions that would delay and distract from the central legal\nquestion of whether Defendant violated [Plaintiffs] rights under Title IX and the Fourteenth\nAmendment while he was a student at Gloucester High School.\" ECF No. 125 at 2.\nAccordingly, the parties consent to dismissal ofRequests for Relief(C) and (D), and ask that the\nCourt dismiss such Requests pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Id. at 3.\nBased on parties' consent, the Court DISMISSES Requests for Relief(C) and (D), which seek a\npermanent injunction and aprospective declaratoryjudgment(ECF No. 113at 17).\nB. Plaintiffs Motion to Vacate Order for Supplemental Briefing\nThe dismissals ofthe requests for prospective declaratory reliefleave Requests for Relief\n(A) and (B), which seek retrospective relief. Plaintiff has advised that these remaining requests\nshouldnot be subjectto mootness challenges, but may be subject to dismissal pursuant to Federal\nRule ofCivil Procedure 12(b)(6). ECF No. 126 at 2.\nPlaintiffargues that his graduation did not moot his request for nominal damages. \"Even\nifa plaintiffs injunctive relief claim has been mooted, the action is not moot ifthe plaintiffmay\nbe 'entitled to at least nominal damages.'\" Rendelman v. Rouse, 569 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.\n2009) (quoting Covenant Media ofS.C., LLCv. CityofN. Charleston, 493 F.3d 421, 429 n.4 (4th\nCir. 2007)).\nPlaintiffalso argues that his request for a retrospective declaratoryjudgment is not moot\nbecause this request is intertwined with the damages claim. A \"plaintiffs request for declaratory\nreliefis not moot [when] his 'damages claim is contingent upon a finding by the court that the\n[complained ofactivity] is unconstitutional.'\" Marks v. City CouncilofCity ofChesapeake, Va.,\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 132   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 6 PageID# 1253\n723 F. Supp. 1155, 1160(E.D. Va. 1988)(second brackets in original), affd 883 F.2d 308 (4th\nCir. 1989).\nDefendant responds byacknowledging that\"a claimisnotmootwhenthereisaclaimfor\ncompensatorydamagesandnominaldamagespending suchthattheplaintiffcould at a minimum\nrecover nominal damages.\" ECF No. 128at 3 (emphasisadded). However,Defendantargues,\nbecause Plaintiff only seeks nominal damages in relation to his request for retroactive\ndeclaratoryrelief, but does not seek compensatorydamages,Plaintiffs case should be declared\nmoot. Id.\n\"When students challenge the constitutionality of school policies, their claims for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief generally become moot when they graduate.\" Mellen v.\nBunting, 327 F.3d 355, 364 (4th Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted). After a student has\ngraduated, \"a case or controversy no longer exists between [the parties] with respect to the\nvalidity ofthe rules at issue.\" Bd. ofSch. Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 129 (1975) (per\ncuriam).\nHowever, claims for damages may continue to present a live controversy. Id. at 365.\nThat is, \"even ifa plaintiffs injunctivereliefclaim hasbeen mooted,the actionis notmootifthe\nplaintiff may be 'entitled to at least nominal damages.'\" Rendelman, 569 F.3d at 187. To be\nawarded nominal damages, a plaintiffneed only show that a constitutional deprivation occurred,\nnot proofofactual injury. Chapin Furniture Outlet Inc. v. TownofChapin, 252 Fed. App'x 566,\n572 (4th Cir. 2007).\nThe decision in Mellen is particularly instructive on this point. In Mellen, cadets at the\nVirginia Military Institute filed a complaint alleging that the Institute's supper prayer violated\nfederal and state constitutions and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom. The cadets sought\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 132   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 6 PageID# 1254\ndeclaratory and injimctive relief, as well as nominal damages. 327 F.3d at 363. The district\ncourt entered summaryjudgmentinfavor ofthe cadets, awarding declaratory reliefandenjoining\nthe defendant from sponsoring the supper prayer. However, as to the request for monetary\ndamages, the district court concluded that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity. The\nparties then filed cross-appeals. Id.\nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit considered whether the case had become moot because the\nplaintiffs no longer attended the Institute. Id. The Fourth Circuit concluded that although the\nformer cadets' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were moot, \"their damage claim\"—\nthat is, their claim for nominal damages—\"continue[d] to present a live controversy.\" Id. at 365\n(citingDoe v. MadisonSch. Dist. No. 321, 177F.3d 789, 798 (9th Cir. 1999)).\nFurthermore, \"to the extent that . . . resolution [of a claim for declaratory relief]\ndetermines liability for damages to redress injuries alleged and proven,\" a plaintiffs claim for\ndeclaratory relief is not necessarily moot. See Marks, 723 F. Supp. at 1159 (citing City of\nCleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 n.7 (1985); Lane v. Reid, 559 F. Supp.\n1047, 1048-51 (S.D.N.Y. 1983)). Accordingly, the Court finds that because Plaintiffs claim for\ndamages rests upon a determination of the constitutionality of the complained-of action, his\nclaim for retrospective declaratory reliefis not moot. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486\n(1969). That is, \"this Court must decide the constitutional issue in order to make possible a\ndecision on [plaintiffs] damages claim.\" Marks, 723 F. Supp. at 1160 (citing Shifrin v. Wilson,\n412 F. Supp. 1282, 1292 (D.D.C. 1976)).\nThis Court concludes that Plaintiffs graduation did not moot either his request for\nnominal damages for the School Board's alleged past violations ofhis rights under Title IX and\nthe Equal Protection Clause or his request for a declaratory judgment regarding these alleged\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 132   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 6 PageID# 1255\nviolations. This Court has jurisdiction over this case to the extent that Plaintiff seeks a\nretrospective declaratory judgment and nominal damages for past alleged violations ofTitle IX\nand the Equal Protection Clause. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) will\nbe taken under advisement after additional briefing.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Consent Motion for Dismissal of Requests for Relief\n(C) and (D) (ECF No. 125) and Plaintiffs Motion to Vacate Order for Supplemental Briefing\n(ECF No. 126) are GRANTED. Accordingly, Requests for Relief (C) and (D) of Plaintiffs\nAmended Complaint (ECF No. 113) are DISMISSED. The October 26, 2017 Order (ECF No.\n123) directing the parties to file supplemental briefing on the question of mootness is\nVACATED.\nThe parties are DIRECTED to file amended briefing regarding Defendant's Motion to\nDismiss (ECF No. 118) as follows: Defendant shall file an amended Motion to Dismiss\nregarding the remaining Requests for Reliefno later than forty-five days after the dateofentry of\nthis Order. Plaintiff shall file a Response no later than twenty-one days after service of\nDefendant's amended Motion. Defendant may file a Reply no later than seven days after service\nofthe Response.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nArenda-frTWright Allen\n^ United States DistrictJudge\nDecember | ^ ,2017\nNorfolk, Virginia",

Although he was designated female at \nbirth, G. has a male gender identity. He has a state \nID  identifying  him  as  male,  and,  as  a  result  of \nhormone therapy, has facial hair, a deep voice, and \nother male secondary sex characteristics.  In every \naspect of life outside school, G. is recognized as a boy. \nAt school, however, G. is singled out from every other \nstudent and forced to use separate restrooms because \nhis  school  board  has  concluded  that  G.’s  mere \npresence  in  a  restroom  used  by  other  boys  is \nunacceptable.  \nTitle  IX  protects  everyone—including \ntransgender  students—from  being  “excluded  from \nparticipation  in”  or  “denied  the  benefits  of”  any \neducation program or activity “on the basis of sex.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The central question in this case \nis whether 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, a regulation allowing \nschools to “provide separate toilet . . . facilities on the \nbasis of sex,” implicitly authorizes schools to prohibit \ntransgender  boys  and  girls  from  using  restrooms \nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity,  effectively \nexcluding  them  from  using  the  common  restrooms \nused by other students. \nWhen the regulation was drafted in 1975, few \nwould have conceived that, as result of advances in \ntreatment  and  support  for  transgender  youth,  a \nstudent like G. would be assigned a female sex at \nbirth  and  yet  have  facial  hair  and  other  male \nsecondary  sex  characteristics,  have  a  male \ndesignation on his government ID card, and be able \nto live all aspects of life in accordance with his male \ngender  identity.  Faced  with  this  reality,  the \n    1   \n\nDepartment  of  Education  (the  “Department”) \nconcluded  that  the  only  way  to  “provide  separate \ntoilet . . . facilities on the basis of sex” in a manner \nthat does not deprive students of equal educational \nopportunity—and  the  only  way  to  make  common \nrestrooms truly accessible—is to allow transgender \nstudents  to  use  restrooms  consistent  with  their \ngender identity.   \nIn  the  decision  below,  the  Fourth  Circuit \ndetermined that the Department’s interpretation was \nneither clearly erroneous nor inconsistent with the \nstatutory  text,  and  therefore  deferred  to  the \nDepartment’s  reasonable  interpretation  of  its  own \nregulation  under  Auer  v.  Robbins,  519  U.S.  452 \n(1997). Petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari to \nreview three questions:   \nFirst,  Petitioner  asks  this  Court  to  overrule \nAuer.  For  decades  this  Court  has  adhered  to  the \nprinciple that an agency’s interpretation of its own \nregulations  should  generally  be  “controlling  unless \nplainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation.”  Id.  at  461  (citing  Bowles  v.  Seminole \nRock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945) (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted)).  In  the  past  five  years, \nthree  sitting  Justices  have  called  for  Auer  to  be \noverruled  or  reconsidered,  but  a  majority  of  this \nCourt has not expressed interest in doing so. There is \nno  special  justification  for  overturning  this  settled \nprinciple of administrative law now. \nSecond, Petitioner asks this Court to resolve a \npurported  circuit  split  regarding  whether  Auer \napplies  to  unpublished  opinion  letters  or \ninterpretations  announced  in  the  context  of  an \nongoing dispute. The first  purported  split  is \n    2   \n\nquestionable;  the  second  one  is  nonexistent;  and \nneither one is implicated by this case because  the \nDepartment’s interpretation pre-dated the litigation \nand was articulated, not just in an opinion letter, but \nalso in a statement of interest and amicus brief. \nThird, Petitioner asks this Court to resolve the \nunderlying  question  of  whether  Title  IX  and  its \nregulations  allow  schools  to  effectively  exclude \ntransgender students from the common restrooms by \nprohibiting  them  from  using  restrooms  consistent \nwith  their  gender  identity.  That  question  may \nultimately warrant this Court’s attention, but this is \nthe wrong case at the wrong time.  There is no circuit \nsplit  and  no  final  judgment;  there  are  no  claims \ninvolving  locker  rooms  or  the  detailed  guidance \nsubsequently  issued  by  the  Department;  and \nPetitioner  has  waived  any  argument  based  on \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1 (1981).  The Court should allow the issue to \ncontinue percolating in the lower courts until a more \nappropriate vehicle arrives. \nMoreover,  the  decision  below  was  correctly \ndecided and does not call for the Court’s immediate \nreview.  The Department’s interpretation of its own \nregulation is the correct interpretation, and it is the \ninterpretation  that  should  prevail  regardless  of \nwhether  it  receives  Auer  deference,  Skidmore \ndeference,  or  no  deference  at  all.  For  all  these \nreasons, the petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \n \n \n    3   \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  Factual background.1 \n“Gender  identity”  is  an  established  medical \nconcept,  referring  to  one’s  sense  of  oneself  as \nbelonging to a particular gender.  C.A. App. 36.  It is \nan innate and immutable aspect of personality, with \nbiological roots. See id.; Aruna Saraswat, M.D., et. \nal.,  Evidence  Supporting  the  Biologic  Nature                    \nof Gender Identity, 21 Endocrine Practice 199, 199-\n202  (2015).2  Everyone  has  a  gender  identity.  \nTransgender  individuals,  however,  have  a  gender \nidentity  that  is  different  than  the  sex  assigned  to \nthem  at  birth,  which  is  usually  based  on  an \nexamination of external anatomy.3 \nG. came out to his parents as a transgender \nboy during his freshman year of high school when the \n                                                        \n1 On a motion to dismiss and motion for preliminary injunction, \nthe  facts  alleged  in  the  Complaint  and  uncontroverted \ndeclarations  must  be  taken  as  true.  See  Schindler  Elevator \nCorp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U.S. 401, 404 n.2 (2011); \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 (1976).  \n2  Petitioner  mischaracterizes  gender  identity  as  something \n“subjective” and impossible to verify or define.  Pet. 1.  There is \nno dispute that G. is a transgender boy and, as a result of \nhormone  therapy,  has  objective  physiological  characteristics \nthat differ from those of typical non-transgender girls.  \n3 Guidelines from the American Psychological Association no \nlonger  use  the  term  “biological  sex”  when  referring  to  sex \nassigned at birth. See Am. Psychological Ass’n, Guidelines for \nPsychological  Practice  with  Transgender  and  Gender \nNonconforming People, App. A (December 2015), http://www. \napa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf.  “Biological sex” is \nan inaccurate description of a person’s sex assigned at birth \nbecause gender identity also has biological roots. \n    4   \n\nstress  of  concealing  his  gender  identity  became  so \ngreat he was unable to attend class.  C.A. App. 12.  \nG.  began  seeing  a  psychologist  with  experience \ncounseling  transgender  youth,  who  diagnosed  G. \nwith gender dysphoria.4  G.’s psychologist gave him a \n“Treatment  Documentation Letter” confirming  that \nhe was receiving treatment for gender dysphoria and \nstating  that  he  should  be  treated  as  a  boy  in  all \nrespects, including when using the restroom. Id. at \n13.  Consistent with that medical advice, G. uses the \nboys’  restrooms  in  all  public  venues,  such  as \nrestaurants, libraries, and shopping centers.  Id. at \n13-14.5 \n                                                        \n4 Gender dysphoria is the diagnostic term for the feeling of \nincongruence between an individual’s gender identity and an \nindividual’s sex assigned at birth, and the resulting distress \ncaused  by  that  incongruence.  Id.  at  11-12.    It  is  a  serious \nmedical  condition  codified  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of \nDiseases.  Id. at 37.  “[G]ender nonconformity is not in itself           \na mental disorder.  The critical element of gender dysphoria is \nthe presence of clinically significant distress associated with  \nthe  condition.”  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Gender  Dysphoria              \nFact Sheet, at 1 (2013), http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender \n%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf.  Treatment  for  gender \ndysphoria is thus designed to help transgender individuals live \ncongruently with their gender identity and eliminate clinically \nsignificant  distress.  C.A.  App.  37.  The  World  Professional \nAssociation for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) has established \ninternational standards of care for gender dysphoria, which are \nrecognized as authoritative by the leading medical and mental \nhealth  organizations,  including  the  American  Medical \nAssociation,  the  Endocrine  Society,  and  the  American \nPsychological Association.  Id.   \n5 G. continues to receive transition-related care in accordance \nwith WPATH standards.  In December 2014, G. began hormone \ntherapy.  Id.  The  WPATH  standards  do  not  permit  genital \n    5   \n\nIn  August  2014,  before  beginning  his \nsophomore  year,  G.  and  his  mother  met  with  the \nprincipal and guidance counselor to explain that G. is \na transgender boy and would be attending school as a \nmale student.  Id. at 14.  G. initially chose to use a \nrestroom in the nurse’s office, but after a few weeks \nG.  found  that  using  a  separate  restroom  was \nstigmatizing  and  that  the  inconvenient  location \ninterfered with his ability to attend class on time.  \nId. at 15.6 \nWith  the  principal’s  permission,  G.  began \nusing the boys’ restroom on October 20, 2014, and \ncontinued doing so for seven weeks without incident.  \nC.A.  App.  15.7  Nevertheless,  some  adults  in  the \ncommunity  were  upset  to  learn a  transgender  boy \nwas using the boys’ restrooms at school.  Id.  Those \nadults contacted the Gloucester County School Board \n(the  “Board”)  demanding  that  the  transgender \nstudent (who was not publicly identified until later) \nbe barred from the boys’ restrooms.  Id. \nThe  Board  took  no  action  for  several  weeks \nuntil Board member Carla Hooks proposed a policy \nfor  public  debate  at  the  Board’s  meeting  on \n                                                                                                                  \nsurgery for minors, Pet. App. 9a, but in June 2016, G. had chest \nreconstruction surgery.  Petitioner’s statement that G. has not \n“had a sex change operation,” Pet. 5, is no longer correct.   \n6 Petitioner’s assertion that “school officials” did not initially \nthink G. should use the boys’ restroom, Pet. 5, lacks foundation \nin the Complaint or the preliminary injunction record.  \n7 G. asked to continue using a home-bound program for physical \neducation.  He therefore does not use the school locker rooms.  \nPet. App. 9a n.2. \n    6   \n\nNovember  11,  2014.  Its  operative  language  stated \nthat: \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to \nprovide male and female restroom and \nlocker room facilities in its schools, and \nthe use of said facilities shall be limited \nto the corresponding biological genders, \nand  students  with  gender  identity \nissues shall be provided an alternative \nappropriate private facility. \nId.  at  15-16.    G.  and  his  parents  attended  the \nmeeting to speak against the policy.  Id. at 16. \nWhen G. spoke, he told the Board:  \nI  use  the  restroom,  the  men’s  public \nrestroom,  in  every  public  space  in \nGloucester County and others.  I have \nnever once had any sort of confrontation \nof any kind. \n. . . \nAll I want to do is be a normal child and \nuse the restroom in peace, and I have \nhad  no  problems  from  students  to  do \nthat—only from adults.  The adults are \nthe only people who have been trying to \nrestrict my rights. \n. . . \nNo one has given me any problem, and I \nhave never been happier exercising my \nright to be who I am.  I did not ask to be \nthis  way,  and  it’s  one  of  the  most \ndifficult things anyone can face.  \n    7   \n\n. . . \nI  deserve  the  rights  of  every  other \nhuman being.  I am just a human. I am \njust a boy. \nGloucester County School Board Video Tr., Nov. 11, \n2014, at 25:00 – 27:22.8  The Board deferred voting \non the policy until its meeting on December 9, 2014.  \nC.A. App. 17.   \nA  week  before  the  next  meeting,  the  Board \nannounced plans to increase privacy protections for \nall  students  by  “adding  or  expanding  partitions \nbetween  urinals  in  male  restrooms,  and  adding \nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms.” \nId.  The  Board  also  announced  “plans  to  designate \nsingle stall, unisex restrooms . . . to give all students \nthe option for even greater privacy.”  Id. \nSpeakers  at  the  December  Board  meeting \nnonetheless  demanded  that  the  Board  exclude  G. \nfrom  the  boys’  restroom  without  waiting  for  the \nprivacy  protections  to  be  installed,  and  they \nthreatened  to  vote  Board  members  out  of  office  if \nthey  refused.  Id.  at  18.  One  speaker  called  G.  a \n“freak” and compared him to a person who thinks he \nis a dog and wants to urinate on fire hydrants.  Id. \nThe  Board  voted  6-1  to  pass  the  policy \nintroduced  the  previous  month  prohibiting \ntransgender  students  from  using  restrooms \nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity.  Id.  It  is  a \ncategorical rule prohibiting administrators from ever \nallowing  transgender  students  to  use  facilities \n                                                        \n8 Available at http://gloucester.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php? \nview_id=10&clip_id=1065.   \n    8   \n\nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity  regardless  of \nthe configuration of the bathroom or the individual \ncircumstances of any student.   \nNo  one  contends  G.  should  use  the  girls’ \nrestrooms. Even before G. transitioned, girls objected \nto his presence in the girls’ restrooms because they \nperceived him to be male.  Id. at 18.  The necessary \nand foreseen consequence of excluding G. from the \nboys’ restrooms is that he, and only he, will have to \nuse an “alternative appropriate private facility.”  Id. \nat 16. \nThe public debate about which restrooms he \nshould  use  has  been humiliating  for  G.,  who  feels \nthat  the  Board’s  actions  have  turned  him  into                \n“a  public  spectacle”  before  the  entire  community, \n“like a walking freak show.” Id. at 31. Being forced to \nuse separate restrooms physically and symbolically \nmarks G. as different, isolates G. from his peers, and \nbrands him as unfit to share the same restrooms as \nothers.  Id. at 19.  The policy is an official decree that \nG.’s mere presence in a restroom is unacceptable and \nthat he should be treated differently than everyone \nelse.   \nThe  Board  subsequently  converted  a  faculty \nrestroom  and  two  utility  closets  into  single-stall \nrestrooms. Although any student is allowed to use \nthose restrooms, no one actually does so.  Id.  For G., \nthe  prospect  of  using  the  converted  single-stall \nrestrooms,  which  were  created  for  the  specific \npurpose  of  isolating  him  from  his  peers,  is \nhumiliating.  Instead he tries to avoid using school \nrestrooms  entirely.  Id.  If  that  is  not  possible,            \nhe  uses  the  nurse’s  restroom,  which  still  makes               \nG.  feel  embarrassed  and  humiliated, knowing that \n    9   \n\neveryone who sees him enter the nurse’s office knows \nhe is there because he is transgender and has been \nbarred from the restrooms other boys use.  Id. at 33.   \nTo  avoid  using  the  restroom,  G.  avoids \ndrinking liquids and tries not to urinate during the \nschool day.  Id. at 19.  As a result, G. has repeatedly \ndeveloped  painful  urinary  tract  infections  and  felt \ndistracted  and  uncomfortable  in  class.  Id.  A \nnationally  recognized  expert  in  the  treatment  of \ngender  dysphoria  in  adolescents  evaluated  G.  and \nconcluded that the stigma he experiences every time \nhe needs to use the restroom “is a devastating blow \nto [G.] and places him at extreme risk for immediate \nand long-term psychological harm.”  Id. at 42.   \nB.  Proceedings Below. \nThe day after the 2014-15 school year ended, \nG.  filed  a  complaint  and  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction against the Board, arguing that the new \npolicy discriminates against him on the basis of sex, \nin  violation  of  Title  IX  and  the  Equal  Protection \nClause.  C.A.  App.  20-22.  The  Complaint  seeks \ninjunctive relief and damages for both claims.  Id. at \n23. \nAn  implementing  regulation  for  Title  IX,               \n34  C.F.R.  §  106.33,  authorizes  schools  to  provide \nseparate restrooms for boys and girls, but does not \nspecifically  address  which  restrooms  transgender \nboys and transgender girls should use.  Since 2013, \nthe  Department  of  Education  has  advised  schools \nthat  “[w]hen  a  school  elects  to  separate  or  treat \nstudents differently on the basis of sex . . . a school \ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent \nwith  their  gender  identity.”  C.A.  App.  55.  On \n    10   \n\nJanuary 7, 2015, The Department issued an opinion \nletter confirming  that  this principle  applies  in the \ncontext of restrooms.  Id. at 54-56.9   The Department \nfurther  elaborated  on  its  interpretation  with  a \nstatement of interest filed with the district court and \nan amicus brief submitted to the Fourth Circuit.  Pet. \nApp. 13a \nThe district court granted the Board’s cross-\nmotion  to  dismiss  the  Title  IX  claim  and  denied             \nG.’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Pet. App. \n84a-117a.  G.  appealed  the  denial  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction and asked the Fourth Circuit to exercise \npendant appellate jurisdiction over the dismissal of \nhis Title IX claim.  Pl’s C.A. Br. at 1.10   \nOn April 19, 2016, the Fourth Circuit reversed \nthe dismissal of the Title IX claim and vacated the \ndenial of a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 1-60a.  \nWith respect to G.’s Title IX claim, the Fourth Circuit \nheld that the Department’s “interpretation of its own \nregulation,  [34  C.F.R.]  §  106.33,  as  it  relates  to \nrestroom  access  by  transgender  individuals,  is \nentitled  to  Auer  deference  and  is  to  be  accorded \ncontrolling weight in this case.”  Pet. App. 25a. \n                                                        \n9 The record does not reflect the identity of the individual who \nrequested the opinion letter because it was redacted in public \nfilings. No. 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM, ECF Nos. 28-1, 28-2 (E.D. \nVa. June 29, 2015). Despite the redaction, Petitioner states that \nit  has  identified  the  individual  by  opening  the  redacted \ndocument “in Preview for Mac.”  Pet. 8 n.3. \n10 Because the Fourth Circuit exercised jurisdiction over the \nmotion to dismiss the Title IX claim, which includes a claim for \ndamages, its decision would not be vacated under United States \nv.  Munsingwear,  340  U.S.  36  (1950),  even  if  the  claims  for \ninjunctive relief were to become moot upon G.’s graduation.   \n    11   \n\nThe  court  methodically  considered  all  the \nconditions  for  applying  Auer.  First,  the  court \nexamined  the  text  of  the  regulation  to  determine \nwhether it unambiguously indicated which restroom \na transgender student should use.  Pet. App. 19-20a.  \nIt  concluded  that  “[a]lthough  the  regulation  may \nrefer  unambiguously  to  males  and  females,  it  is \nsilent as to how a school should determine whether a \ntransgender individual is a male or female for the \npurpose of access to sex-segregated restrooms.”  Id. \nThe  court  then  examined  whether  the \nDepartment’s  interpretation  of  34  C.F.R.  §  106.33 \nwas  plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation’s text.  Pet. App. 20-23a.  Once again, the \ncourt  independently  reviewed  the  text  and \ndetermined that dictionaries contemporaneous to the \npassage  of  Title  VII  and  Title  IX  defined  “sex”            \nas “the character of being male or female” or “the \nsum  of  the  morphological,  physiological,  and \nbehavioral  peculiarities  .  .  .  that  is  typically \nmanifested  as  maleness  or  femaleness.”  Pet.  App. \n21a. These dictionary definitions thus “shed[] little \nlight on how exactly to determine the ‘character of \nbeing either male or female’ where those indicators \ndiverge.”  Pet. App. 22a.  The court concluded that \nED’s interpretation of the regulation was therefore \nconsistent with the regulation’s text and not clearly \nerroneous.  Pet. App. 21-23a. \nFinally,  the  court  determined  that  the \nDepartment’s  interpretation  reflected  its  fair  and \nreasoned  judgment  and  not  a  post-hoc  litigating \nposition.  Pet. App. 23-24a.  As the Fourth Circuit \npointed out, the Department’s interpretation dated \nback to 2013 and was consistent with “the existing \n    12   \n\nguidance[]  and  regulations  of  a  number  of  federal \nagencies—all  of  which  provide  that  transgender \nindividuals  should  be  permitted  access  to  the \nrestroom  that  corresponds  with  their  gender \nidentities.”  Pet. App. 24a. \nIn response to arguments that G.’s use of the \nboy’s  restroom  would  infringe  the  constitutional \nprivacy rights of other students, the court noted that \nthe cases cited by the Board involved students who \nwere  videotaped  naked  in  a  locker  room  or \nindiscriminately  strip  searched.  “G.G.’s  use—or  for \nthat  matter any individual’s appropriate  use—of  a \nrestroom  [does]  not  involve  the  [same]  type  of \nintrusion.”  Pet. App. 25-26a n.10.  That is especially \ntrue here because of the partitions between urinals \nand privacy strips for stall doors.  All students who \nwant greater privacy for any reason may also use one \nof  the  new  single-stall  restrooms.  Pet  App.  11a; \naccord Pet. App. 37-38a (Davis, J., concurring). \nSenior Judge Davis concurred and emphasized \nthat  “[t]he  uncontroverted  facts  before  the  district \ncourt  demonstrate  that  as  a  result  of  the  Board’s \nrestroom policy, G.G. experiences daily psychological \nharm  that  puts  him  at  risk  for  long-term \npsychological  harm.”  Pet.  App.  37a.  Judge  Davis \nurged the district court on remand to take “prompt \naction”  because  “[b]y  the  time  the  district  court \nissues  its  decision,  G.G.  will  have  suffered  the \npsychological harm the injunction sought to prevent \nfor an entire school year.”  Pet. App. 39a. \nJudge Niemeyer dissented. Pet. App. 40-60a.  \nHe did not identify any privacy concerns raised by \nthe  facts  of  this  case  and  acknowledged  that  “the \nrisks  to  privacy  and  safety are far reduced” in \n    13   \n\nthe  context  of  restrooms.  Pet.  App.  53a.  Judge \nNiemeyer instead focused on transgender students’ \nuse  of  locker  rooms  and  potential  exposure  to \n“private body parts.”  Pet. App. 52a.  The dissent did \nnot contend it would be appropriate for G. to use the \ngirls’ restrooms.  Pet. App. 59a. \nAfter  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  ruling,  the \nDepartment  of  Education  issued  comprehensive \nguidance  to  school  districts  on  how  to  provide \ntransgender  students  equal  access  to  school \nresources  consistent  with  Title  IX.  Pet.  App.  126-\n142a.  The  Department  also  provided  examples  of \nschool policies from across the country.11   \nOn May 31, 2016, the Fourth Circuit denied \nrehearing en banc. Pet. App. 60-61a. Judge Niemeyer \ndissented from denial of panel rehearing.  Pet. App. \n61-66a. The court subsequently denied the Board’s \nmotion to stay the mandate pending disposition of a \npetition  for  certiorari,  with  Judge  Niemeyer  again \ndissenting.  Pet. App. 67-70a. \nOn  remand,  the  district  court  entered  a \npreliminary injunction allowing G. to use the boys’ \nrestroom  at  school.  Pet.  App.  71-72a.  The  court \nemphasized  that  the  injunction  applies  only  to  G. \nand only to restrooms at the high school.  Pet. App. \n72a.  The district court and the Fourth Circuit, over \nJudge  Niemeyer’s  dissent,  denied  the  Board’s \nmotions to stay the preliminary injunction pending \n                                                        \n11  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.

Pet.  App.  73-75a,  76-81a.    Judge  Davis \nconcurred, responding to the dissent’s assertion that \nthe  G.G.  opinion  was  “unprecedented.”    Pet.  App. \n79a.  He noted that “[t]he First, Sixth, Ninth, and \nEleventh  Circuits  have  all  recognized  that \ndiscrimination  against  a  transgender  individual \nbased  on  that  person’s  transgender  status  is \ndiscrimination  because  of  sex  under  federal  civil \nrights statutes and the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe  Constitution.”  Pet.  App.  78a.  Judge  Davis \nexplained  that  the  panel’s  decision  rested  on  “this \nlong-settled jurisprudential foundation.”  Id. \nOn  August  3,  2016,  this  Court  granted  the \nBoard’s application to stay and recall the mandate \nand  stay  the  preliminary  injunction  pending \ndisposition  of  the  Board’s  petition  for  certiorari.  \nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G., No. 16A52, 2016 WL \n4131636 (U.S. Aug. 3, 2016). \nOn  August  29,  2016,  the  Board  filed  a \ncombined  petition  for  (a)  an  interlocutory  writ  of \ncertiorari  from  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  ruling  on  the \nmotion to dismiss, and (b) a writ of certiorari before \njudgment  from  the  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunction order.  Pet 17.  \n \n \n \n    15   \n\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \nI.  THIS  COURT  HAS  ADHERED  TO           \nAUER  FOR  DECADES,  AND  THERE               \nIS  NO  SPECIAL  JUSTIFICATION  FOR \nREVISITING  THAT  LONGSTANDING \nPRECEDENT NOW. \nAuer deference is a longstanding principle of \nadministrative  law,  dating  back  to  this  Court’s \ndecision  in  Bowles  v.  Seminole  Rock  &  Sand  Co.,            \n325  U.S.  410  (1945).  For  decades  this  Court  has \nadhered  to  the  principle  that  an  agency’s \ninterpretation of its own regulations should generally \nbe  given  “controlling  weight  unless  it  is  plainly \nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.” Id. at \n414.  “Occasionally,  Members  of  this  Court  have \nargued  in  separate  writings  that  the  Court  failed \nappropriately to apply Seminole Rock deference, but \nin none of those cases did the majority opinions of the \nCourt expressly refuse to do so.” Perez v. Mortgage \nBankers  Ass’n,  135  S.  Ct.  1199,  1214  n.2  (2015) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting).  \nThe first time any member of the Court called \nAuer  deference  into  question  was  Justice  Scalia’s \nconcurring opinion in Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan \nBell Telephone Co., 564 U.S. 50, 67 (2011) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring).  Over  the  next  five  years,  three  other \nJustices  have  called  for  Auer  to  be  overruled  or \nreconsidered, but a  majority of this Court has not \nexpressed interest in doing so.  See United Student \nAid Funds, Inc. v. Bible, 136 S. Ct. 1607, 1608 (2016) \n(Thomas,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of  certiorari) \n(collecting cases).  Just last term, the Court declined \nto grant certiorari in a case calling for Auer to be \n    16   \n\nreconsidered and overruled.  See Petition for Writ of \nCertiorari, United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Bible, \n136 S. Ct. 1607 (No. 15-861). \nIn asking this Court to overturn longstanding \nprecedent  that  has  been  woven  into  the  fabric  of \nadministrative law, Petitioner bears a heavy burden.  \n“Before  overturning  a  long-settled  precedent”  this \nCourt  requires  “‘special  justification,’  not  just  an \nargument that the precedent was wrongly decided.”  \nHalliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 134 S. \nCt.  2398,  2407  (2014).    As  this  Court  has  further \nrecognized, “the principle of stare decisis has special \nforce in respect to statutory interpretation because \nCongress remains free to alter what [the Court] ha[s] \ndone.”  Id.  at  2411  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).   \nHere, Congress has not acted and Petitioner \noffers  no  special  justification  for  overruling  Auer \nother  than  disagreement  with  its  holding.                       \nBy  contrast,  the  reliance  interests  of  regulated \ncommunities  that  depend  on  agency  guidance  to \nreduce uncertainty about their legal obligations, and \nthe clarity provided by a stable “background rule,” \nreinforce  the  appropriateness  of  adhering  to  stare \ndecisis  in  this  context.  See  Cass  R.  Sunstein  & \nAdrian Vermeule, The Unbearable Rightness of Auer, \nForthcoming  U.  Chi.  L.  Rev.,  at  22-34  (2016), \nhttp://ssrn.com/abstract=2716737; Conor Clarke, The \nUneasy Case Against Auer & Seminole Rock, 33 Yale \nL. & Pol’y Rev. 175, 193 (2014).   \nAbandoning  Auer  would  “have  radical \nimplications  for  delegation,  the  combination  of \nfunctions  in  agencies,  and  other  fundamental \nfeatures  of  the  modern  administrative  state.”  \n    17   \n\nSunstein & Vermeule, supra, at 2.  When an agency \noversteps,  this  Court  has  tools  at  its  disposal  to \nwithhold Auer deference.  Perez, 135 S. Ct. at 1208 \nn.4.  Dramatically altering foundational principles of \nadministrative  law  is  neither  necessary  nor \nappropriate.  \nII.  THIS CASE DOES NOT IMPLICATE ANY \nALLEGED CIRCUIT SPLIT REGARDING \nDEFERENCE  TO  INFORMAL  AGENCY \nACTION  OR  INTERPRETATIONS \nANNOUNCED DURING LITIGATION. \nPetitioner  argues  that  this  case  provides  a \nvehicle  for  resolving  two  purported  circuit  splits \nregarding the application of Auer. The first purported \nsplit is questionable; the second one is nonexistent; \nand neither one is implicated by this case. \nFirst, Petitioner claims the circuits are  split \nregarding the level of deference owed to unpublished \nagency opinion letters.  Pet. 26-29.  But if such a split \nexists, it is not relevant to this case.  By focusing \nexclusively  on  the  “Ferg-Cadima  letter,”  Petitioner \nattempts to portray the Fourth Circuit’s decision as \nan  example  of  deference  to  “a  piece  of  private \ncorrespondence” from “an agency employee.”  Pet. 38.  \nEven  if  that  characterization  were  accurate,  the \nDepartment’s  interpretation  of  34  C.F.R.  §  106.33 \nwas not limited to a single opinion letter.  It was \nthoroughly  explained  in  the  statement  of  interest \nfiled at the district court and in the amicus brief filed \nin the court of appeals.  As this Court unanimously \nreaffirmed in Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 \nU.S.  195,  209  (2011),  these  briefs  independently \nqualify for Auer deference.  Whatever dispute exists \n    18   \n\namong the courts of appeals regarding deference to \nan opinion letter from a low-ranking bureaucrat, that \ndispute has no bearing on this case. \nMoreover, no circuit subscribes to Petitioner’s \nbroad proposition that agency interpretations must \nappear  in  a  format  carrying  the  force  of  law  to \nreceive Auer deference.  Pet. 27.  Petitioner derives \nsuch a requirement from Judge Posner’s 13-year-old \ndicta  in  Keys  v.  Barnhart,  347  F.3d  990  (7th  Cir. \n2003).  Auer, however, contains no such requirement, \nand  the  dicta  cited  by  Petitioner  reflects  Judge \nPosner’s prediction at the time that “[p]robably there \nis little left of Auer.” Id. at 993.  The past 13 years \nhave  proven  that  prediction  wrong.  Compare  id. \n(“Briefs certainly don’t have ‘the force of law.’”), with  \nChase Bank, 562 U.S. at 209 (reaffirming that Auer \napplies to statements in amicus briefs). \nIf there is any split regarding the narrow issue \nof deference to informal opinion letters, the evidence \nof such disagreement is stale and inconclusive: \n  The  First  Circuit  decision  cited  by \nPetitioner concerned informal statements \nat  a  seminar,  not  an  agency  opinion \nletter.  See United States v. Lachman, 387 \nF.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004).   \n  The other Seventh Circuit authority cited \nby  Petitioner  is  a  15-year-old  decision \nthat applied Skidmore to an opinion letter \nwithout  mentioning  Auer  at  all,  U.S. \nFreightways Corp. v. Commissioner, 270 \nF.3d 1137 (7th Cir. 2001). \n \n    19   \n\n  The  Eleventh  Circuit  has  without \nexplanation  applied  Skidmore  deference \nto such letters,  see  Arriaga v. Fla. Pac. \nFarms, L.L.C., 305 F.3d 1228, 1238 (11th \nCir.  2002),  but  it  has  also  without \nexplanation  applied  Auer,  see  Falken  v. \nGlynn  Cty.,  Ga.,  197  F.3d  1341,  1350 \n(11th Cir. 1999). \nEven if the decision below had deferred only to \nan  unpublished  agency  opinion,  this  haphazard \ncollection  of  stale  cases  hardly  constitutes  a  split \nready for this Court’s review.   \nSecond, Petitioner also alleges the circuits are \nsplit  regarding  deference  to  agency  positions \nannounced during litigation.  Pet. 29-31.  Once again, \neven if a split existed, it would not be implicated by \nthis case because the Department’s interpretation of \n§  106.33  dates  back  to  2013,  before  this  litigation \narose.  C.A. App. 55. \nIf  Petitioner’s  first  purported  split  was \nquestionable,  the  second  one  is  nonexistent.    In \nsupport of a split, Petitioner relies on decisions in \nwhich the government itself was a party defending \nits own actions.  Vietnam Veterans of Am. v. CIA, 811 \nF.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2015); Mass. Mutual Life Ins. Co. \nv.  United  States,  782  F.3d  1354  (Fed.  Cir.  2015).  \nEvery  circuit,  including  the  Fourth  Circuit,  agrees \nthat  Auer  deference  is  inappropriate  when  an \ninterpretation  is  “a  convenient  litigating  position.”  \nPet.  App.  17a.  That  principle,  however,  applies  to \npost  hoc  rationalizations  “advanced  by  an  agency \nseeking to defend past agency action against attack.”  \nAuer, 519 U.S. at 462.   \n    20   \n\nWhen an agency is not itself a party, the fact \nthat its interpretation is announced for the first time \nin an amicus  brief  does  not  “make  it  unworthy  of \ndeference.”  Id.  The Department of Education is not \na party to this case, and the fact that the agency \nissued an opinion letter (which was consistent with \nprior agency guidance) in the context of this dispute \nis neither unusual nor inappropriate.   \nIII.  THIS  CASE  IS  A  POOR  VEHICLE  FOR \nRESOLVING  TITLE  IX’S  APPLICATION \nTO TRANSGENDER STUDENTS’ USE OF \nRESTROOMS. \nPetitioner’s third question presented asks this \nCourt to decide the underlying question of whether \nTitle  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  allow \nschools to exclude transgender boys and girls from \nusing  restrooms  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity, effectively excluding them from the common \nrestrooms  entirely.    That  question  may  ultimately \nwarrant this Court’s attention, but this is the wrong \ncase at the wrong time.  Consistent with its usual \npractices,  the  Court  should  allow  the  issue  to \ncontinue percolating in the lower courts until a more \nappropriate vehicle arrives. \nA.  No  Other  Court  of  Appeals  Has \nConsidered the Question Presented. \nThe decision below is the first and only circuit \ncourt  opinion  to  consider  how  Title  IX  applies  to \ntransgender  students’  use  of  restrooms.  There  are \nother cases in the pipeline that will soon give other \ncircuits a chance to consider the issue and give the \nFourth  Circuit  opportunities  to  further  refine  its \n    21   \n\nanalysis.12  As other courts of appeals consider these \ncases, they will produce a consensus or a circuit split.  \nIn either event, the issue would benefit from further \nexploration in the lower courts.   \nThis Court’s usual practice is to wait until a \ncircuit  split  emerges  before  granting  review  to \nresolve  important  legal  questions.  See  Sup.  Ct.  R. \n10(a). Before this Court resolves a new legal question \n“[i]t often will be preferable to allow several courts to \npass on a given . . . claim in order to gain the benefit \nof adjudication by different courts in different factual \ncontexts.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n(1979).  “[W]hen  frontier  legal  problems  are \npresented,  periods  of  ‘percolation’  in,  and  diverse \nopinions from, state and federal appellate courts may \nyield  a  better  informed  and  more  enduring  final \npronouncement by this Court.” Arizona v. Evans, 514 \nU.S. 1, 23 n.1 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  \nThere  is  no  reason  for  this  Court  to  grant \ncertiorari now, without “the benefit it receives from \npermitting  several  courts  of  appeals  to  explore  a \ndifficult  question.”  United  States  v.  Mendoza,  464 \nU.S. 154, 160 (1984). Petitioner argues that certiorari \n                                                        \n12 See Carcaño v. McCrory, No. 1:16CV236, 2016 WL 4508192 \n(M.D.N.C. Aug. 26, 2016); Texas v. United States, No. 7:16-CV-\n00054-O, 2016 WL 4426495 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016); Bd. of \nEduc. of the Highland Local Sch.

United States Dep’t of \nEduc., No. 16 C 4945, 2016 WL 3269001 (N.D. Ill. June 15, \n2016); Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist., 2:16-cv-00943 \n(E.D. Wis. filed July 19, 2016); M.A.B. ex rel. L.A.B. & L.F.B. v. \nBd. Of Educ., 1:16-cv-02622-GLR (D. Md. filed July 19, 2016); \nNebraska  v.  United  States,  4:16-cv-03117-JMG-CRZ  (D.  Ne. \nfiled July 8, 2016). \n    22   \n\nis necessary to resolve the tension created between \nthe  Fourth  Circuit’s  decision  and  the  nation-wide \ninjunction  issued  by  the  district  court  in  Texas  v. \nUnited  States,  No.  7:16-CV-00054-O,  2016  WL \n4426495 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016), which also covers \nthe government’s activities in jurisdictions within the \nFourth Circuit.  Pet. 31-32.  Courts in the Fourth \nCircuit, however, have continued to adhere to their \nown  circuit  precedent  without  difficulty.    See \nCarcaño  v.  McCrory,  No.  1:16CV236,  2016  WL \n4508192, at *13 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 26, 2016).  To the \nextent that the injunction from the Northern District \nof  Texas  interferes  with  other  circuits’  control  of \nprecedent in their geographic jurisdictions, that is a \nreason  for  the  injunction  to  be  narrowed  or \noverturned  on  appeal  as  an  abuse  of  the  district \ncourt’s discretion. See Califano, 442 U.S. at 702.  It is \nnot  a  reason  to  allow  a  single  district  court  to \n“foreclos[e]  adjudication  by  a  number  of  different \ncourts and judges,” and increase “the pressures on \nthis Court’s docket.”  Id.13 \nB.  The  Petition  Seeks  Interlocutory \nReview Without a Final Judgment. \nPetitioners  seek  a  writ  of  certiorari  on  an \ninterlocutory basis from the Fourth Circuit’s denial \nof a motion to dismiss and a writ of certiorari before \njudgment  from  the  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunction order.  This Court, however, usually waits \nto  review  final  judgments  instead  of  granting \ncertiorari  in  an  interlocutory  posture.  See  Mount \n                                                        \n13 Moreover, there are jurisdictional obstacles in the Texas case \nthat may well result in dismissal without reaching the merits of \nthe Title IX question.  Pet. App. 192-209a. \n    23   \n\nSoledad Mem’l Ass’n v. Trunk, 132 S. Ct. 2535, 2536 \n(2012) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of petition for \ncertiorari); DTD Enters., Inc. v. Wells, 130 S. Ct. 7, 8 \n(2009)  (Kennedy,  J.,  joined  by  Roberts,  C.J.,  and \nSotomayor,  J.,  concurring  in  denial  of  petition  for \ncertiorari); Va. Military Inst. v. United States, 508 \nU.S. 946, 946 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in denial \nof petition for certiorari). And this Court exercises its \ndiscretion to grant certiorari before judgment even \nmore sparingly.  Such a petition will be granted “only \nupon a showing that the case is of such imperative \npublic importance as to justify deviation from normal \nappellate  practice  and  to  require  immediate \ndetermination  in  this  Court.”    Sup.  Ct.  R.  11;  see \nAaron v. Cooper, 357 U.S. 566, 567 (1958).   \nThe  Court  should  follow  its  normal  practice \nand wait for final judgment in this case too.  The \nbasic facts of this dispute have not yet been settled.  \nIf the Board had petitioned for certiorari after final \njudgment, the Court would know the actual content \nand  sources  of  the  complaints  the  Board  allegedly \nreceived;  the  Court  would  have  testimony  from \nadministrators  at  Gloucester  High  School  who \nopposed  the  Board’s  unnecessary  and  humiliating \npolicy;  the  Court  would  have  evidence  about  the \nBoard’s  actual  motivations  for  passing  the  new \npolicy; and the Court would know the full extent of \nharm the Board’s policy has inflicted on G. during his \njunior year.   \nTitle IX “requires careful consideration of the \nsocial  context  in  which  particular  behavior  occurs \nand  is  experienced  by  its  target.”  Oncale  v. \nSundowner  Offshore  Servs.,  Inc.,  523  U.S.  75,  81 \n(1998).  Before granting certiorari, the Court should \n    24   \n\nensure it has all the facts necessary to make that \nassessment.  \nC.   This Case Involves Only Restrooms, \nNot Locker Rooms. \nAlthough  Petitioner  and  the  dissent  below \nargue that the Department’s interpretation of its own \nregulation would infringe upon privacy rights in the \ncontext of locker rooms, see Pet. 14, the facts of this \ncase concern access to restrooms only.  As the Fourth \nCircuit explained, “G.G.’s use—or for that matter any \nindividual’s appropriate use—of a restroom will not \ninvolve  the  type  of  intrusion  present”  in  cases \ninvolving  nudity.  Pet.  App.  25a  n.10.  Even  the \ndissent acknowledged that “the risks to privacy and \nsafety are far reduced” in the context of restrooms.  \nId. at 53a (Niemeyer, J., dissenting). Cf. Cruzan v. \nSpecial Sch. Dist, No. 1, 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. \n2002)  (rejecting  claim  that  allowing  transgender \nwoman to use women’s restroom created hostile work \nenvironment  for  non-transgender  woman  in  the \nabsence  of  an  allegation  of  “any  inappropriate \nconduct other than merely being present”).    \nThe proper vehicle for addressing speculation \nabout locker rooms is an actual case and controversy \ninvolving locker rooms.  Without any factual context, \nPetitioners  ask  this  Court  to  adopt  the  dissent’s \nassertion—apparently  as  a  matter  of  law—that \nsingle-sex  locker  rooms  and  dormitories  would \n“function nonsensically” if transgender students are \nnot excluded from those spaces.   See Pet. 35; Pet. \nApp. 53a (Niemeyer, J., dissenting).  But that is an \nempirical  claim,  not  a  legal  one,  which  should  be \ninformed by the facts from an actual dispute.      \n    25   \n\n \nA concrete factual context would dispel many \nof the untested assumptions underlying the dissent \nbelow.14  Most  transgender  students,  who  may  feel \ndeeply  embarrassed  about  parts  of  their  anatomy \nthat are different, take great pains to ensure that \nanatomy is not exposed.  With privacy curtains and \nother partitions, school districts across the country \nhave addressed the privacy needs of all students in \nlocker rooms in a non-stigmatizing manner based on \nthe particular needs of the situation.  See Carcaño, \n2016 WL 4508192. at *15 (summarizing information \nfrom  school  administrators  that  public  school \nchanging  rooms  “today  often  contain  partitions, \ndividers,  and  other  mechanisms  to  protect  privacy \nsimilar  to  bathrooms”);  accord  ED,  Examples  of \nPolicies and Emerging Practices at 7-8.  There are \nmany  ways  to  address  privacy  concerns  on  an \nindividualized  basis  without  a  “blanket  ban.”  \nCarcaño, 2016 WL 4508192, at *15.15  \nWhen  the  government  facially  classifies \nstudents on the basis of sex, it is especially important \nfor  courts  to  base  decisions  on  a  factual  record  to \nensure those classifications are evaluated “through \nreasoned  analysis  rather  than  through  the \n                                                        \n14  For  example,  despite  the  dissent’s  repeated  reference  to \nshowers, there are no functional showers in the Gloucester High \nSchool building.  See Pl.’s  C.A. Br. 41 n.13. \n15  Guidelines  from  the  Virginia  Department  of  Education \nalready require “private showers with enclosed dressing rooms” \nat  public  schools.  Va.

Schs.  20  (2013),  http://www.doe. \nvirginia.gov/support/facility_construction/school_construction/re\ngs_guidelines/guidelines.pdf. \n    26   \n\nmechanical  application  of  traditional,  often \ninaccurate, assumptions.”  Miss. Univ. for Women v. \nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 726 (1982).  This is not the first \ntime this Court has been asked to make sweeping \nconclusions  about  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and \ntransgender people based on bare assertions about \nwhat is “inherent in human nature” or “universally \naccepted”  “across  societies  and  history.”  Pet.  App. \n42a,  50a  (Niemeyer,  J.,  dissenting).    Thirty  years \nago, the majority and concurring opinions in Bowers \nv. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), rested on similarly \nsweeping statements that, upon closer examination, \nproved to be “more complex” or “at the very least . . . \noverstated.”  Lawrence  v.  Texas,  539  U.S.  557,  571 \n(2003).  Faced  with  similar  assertions  about \ntransgender individuals, this Court should wait for \nan actual case involving locker rooms to test those \nassertions appropriately.16 \nD.  This  Case  Is  Not  a  Vehicle  for \nEvaluating  the  Detailed  Guidance \nIssued  by  the  Department  of \nEducation. \nThe only question before the Court is whether \nthe  Board’s  categorical  rule  excluding  transgender \nstudents from using restrooms consistent with their \ngender  identity  is  authorized  by  Title  IX  and  34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.33.    This petition does  not  provide  a \nvehicle  to  decide  whether  the  detailed  guidance \nissued  by  the  Department  of  Education  after  the \n                                                        \n16 As the panel majority noted, the dissent’s assertion about \nwhat  “sexual  responses”  are  “inherent  in  human  nature” \nconspicuously ignores the existence of lesbian, gay, and bisexual \nstudents.  Pet. App. 26a-27a n.11.  \n    27   \n\nFourth Circuit’s decision is entitled to deference or \nshould  have  been  issued  through  notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  Cf. Texas, 2016 WL 4426495, \nat *11-*13. \nSimilarly,  this  case  is  not  a  vehicle  for \naddressing  Petitioner’s  criticisms  about  various \naspects of the guidance. Pet. 14-15. The only question \nis whether Title IX permits school boards to enact \ncategorical  rules  prohibiting  administrators  from \nallowing  any  transgender  student  to  use  facilities \nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity  regardless  of \nthe facts of any particular situation.  \nE.  This  Case  Is  Not  a  Vehicle  for \nAddressing Pennhurst Challenges. \nPetitioner  asserts  that  deference  to  ED’s \ninterpretation would deprive the Board of the “clear \nnotice”  required  by  Pennhurst  State  School  & \nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981).  Pet. 36-\n37.  The Board has already waived that argument, \nhowever, by failing to raise it at any stage of this \ncase.  See  Pl.’s  C.A.  Reply  Br.  at  14  n.9  (noting \nwaiver). \nMoreover, even if notice were inadequate, the \nlack of notice would have no bearing on G.’s requests \nfor injunctive relief.  Pennhurst does not affect “the \nscope of the behavior Title IX proscribes,” but merely \nthe  availability  of  “money  damages.”  Davis  ex  rel. \nLaShonda D., v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. \n629,  639  (1999);  Gebser  v.  Lago  Vista  Indep.  Sch. \nDist., 524 U.S. 274, 287 (1998).  \nOn  the  merits,  Petitioner’s  Pennhurst \nargument  is  also  foreclosed  by  Davis  and  Jackson             \nv.  Birmingham  Bd.  of  Educ.,  544  U.S.  167,  175 \n    28   \n\n(2005), which held that Title IX puts recipients on \nnotice  of  liability  for  all  forms  of  intentional \ndiscrimination for purposes of Pennhurst. Congress \nand administrative agencies need not “prospectively \nresolve  every  possible  ambiguity  concerning \nparticular  applications”  of  the  statute  and \nregulations.  Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. \n656, 669 (1985).  Notice is provided “by the statutory \nprovisions,  regulations,  and  other  guidelines \nprovided by the Department at t[he] time” the funds \nare received.  Id. at 670. \nIV.  THE JUDGMENT BELOW IS CORRECT. \nFinally,  certiorari  should  be  denied  because \nthe Board’s policy is not authorized by the regulation \non which it purportedly relies, regardless of whether \nthe  Department’s  interpretation  of  that  regulation \nreceives Auer deference, Skidmore deference, or no \ndeference at all. \nA.  The  Interpretation  of  34  C.F.R.  § \n106.33  Adopted  Below  Is  Correct, \nWith or Without Auer Deference. \nUnder  Title  IX,  students  are  “specifically \nshielded from being ‘excluded from participation in’ \nor ‘denied the benefits of’ any ‘education program or \nactivity  receiving  [f]ederal  financial  assistance.’”  \nDavis, 526 U.S. at 650 (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)).  \n“The most obvious example” of a Title IX violation is \n“the  overt,  physical deprivation of  access to  school \nresources.”  Id.  The question in this case is whether \nthere is an exception to this general principle that \nallows  schools  to  deprive  transgender  students  of \naccess to school resources by prohibiting them from \nusing the common restrooms used by other students.   \n    29   \n\nInstead  of  adopting  such  an  interpretation,  the \nDepartment properly concluded that when a school \nprovides  separate  restrooms  for  boys  and  girls,  it \nmust  allow  all  boys  and  girls—including  boys  and \ngirls who are transgender—to use those restrooms.  \nAnd the only way transgender students can do so is if \nthey  are  allowed  to  use  restrooms  consistent  with \ntheir gender identity. \nThe term “sex” in 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, as in the \nunderlying  statute,  encompasses  all  physiological, \nanatomical,  and  behavioral  aspects  of  sex.    That \ninterpretation  is  consistent  with  dictionary \ndefinitions, see Pet. App. 20-23a, it is consistent with \nPrice  Waterhouse  v.  Hopkins,  490  U.S.  228,  242 \n(1989), see Pet. App. 78-79a (Davis, J., concurring), \nand  it  is  consistent  with  this  Court’s  repeated \ninstructions  to  construe  Title  IX  broadly  to \nencompass  “a  wide  range  of  intentional  unequal \ntreatment,” Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175.17  \nIn  the  context  of  a  transgender  student, \nhowever, it is impossible to assign a restroom that \ncorresponds with  all  those  components of sex.    As \nJudge Niemeyer conceded: \nIf the term ‘sex’ as used in the statute \nand  regulations  refers  to  both  [sex \n                                                        \n17 This Court’s own contemporaneous decisions from the early \n1970s refute Petitioner’s anachronistic assertion that Title IX \nand  its  implementing  regulations  reflect  a  terminological \ndistinction  between  “sex”  and  “gender.”  This  Court’s  equal \nprotection  cases  exclusively  referred  to  “sex”  discrimination \nuntil Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974), when the petitioner’s \nbrief and the Court’s opinion first used “gender” as a synonym.  \nSee also Catherine Crocker, Ginsburg Explains Origins of Sex, \nGender, Associated Press (Nov. 21, 1993). \n    30   \n\nassigned at birth] and gender identity, \nthen, while the School Board’s policy is \nin  compliance  with  respect  to  most \nstudents, whose [sex assigned at birth] \naligns  with  their  gender  identity,  for \nstudents whose [sex assigned at birth] \nand  gender  identity  do  not  align,  no \nrestroom  or  locker  room  separation \ncould  ever  .  .  .  satisfy  the  conjunctive \ncriteria. \nPet.  App.  56-57a  (Niemeyer,  J.,  dissenting) \n(emphasis omitted).  From that simple fact, Judge \nNiemeyer concluded that the regulation must allow \nschools  to  assign  students  to  restrooms  based  on \ntheir sex assigned at birth instead of their gender \nidentity.  Id.  But that is a policy argument, not an \ninexorable command from the regulation’s plain text.   \nWhen the regulation was drafted, few would \nhave conceived that students like G. would have been \nassigned a female sex at birth and yet, as a result     \nof  hormone  therapy,  have  facial  hair  and  other      \nmale  secondary  sex  characteristics,  have  a  male \ndesignation on his government ID card, and live all \naspects of life in accordance with his male gender \nidentity.  An interpretation of the regulation allowing \nG. to use the boys’ restroom is no more “novel,” Pet. \n12, than an interpretation placing him in the girls’ \nrestroom.  What  is  “novel”  is  the  existence  of \ntransgender  students  who  are  finally  able  to  live \nconsistently with their gender identity. \nBut  G.  and  other  transgender  students  do \nexist and they must use the restroom, just like any \nother  human  being.  The  regulation  does  not \nauthorize schools simply  to  banish  transgender \n    31   \n\nstudents from the boys’ and girls’ restrooms entirely.  \nWhen a school has separate restrooms for boys and \ngirls,  all  boys  and  girls,  including  those  who  are \ntransgender,  must  be  able  to  use  those  restrooms.  \nAbsent  a  regulation  specifically  addressing  which \nrestroom  a  transgender  student  should  use,  the \ninterpretation  that  actually  enables  transgender \nstudents to use the common restrooms is one that \nallows  transgender  students  to  use  restrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity.   \nInstead of asking which interpretation of 34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.33  provides  an  equal  education  to \ntransgender  students,  Petitioner  and  the  dissent \nbelow  argue  that  excluding  transgender  students \nfrom restrooms consistent with their gender identity \nis the only interpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 that \nadequately protects other students’ privacy.  Even if \nthat were the right question, no one disputes that \nseparating  restrooms  on  the  basis  of  sex  reflects \ntraditions of modesty between men and women, but, \nas  the  panel  explained,  “the  truth  of  these \npropositions” does not answer the question of which \nrestroom a transgender boy like G. should use.  Pet. \nApp. 26a.  \nThe Board assumes social customs regarding \nprivacy are built entirely around a person’s genitals \neven in contexts such as restrooms, where there is no \nexposure to nudity. Pet. 35; Pet. App. 53a (Niemeyer, \nJ.,  dissenting).  But  that  assertion  is  hardly  self-\nevident.  For  many  people,  the  presence  of  a \ntransgender  man  (who  may  look  indistinguishable \nfrom  a  non-transgender  man)  in  the  women’s \nrestroom  would  be  more  discomfiting  than  the \npresence  of  a  transgender  woman  (who  may  look \n    32   \n\nindistinguishable  from  a  non-transgender  woman).  \nPet. App. 24a n.8.  Indeed, in G.’s own experience, his \nuse of the women’s restroom was far more disruptive \nthan his current use of the men’s restroom has been.  \nC.A. App. 18. \nSchools  can  and  do  protect  all  students’ \nprivacy without excluding transgender students from \nthe  same  facilities  as  everyone  else.  See  ED, \nExamples of Policies and Emerging Practices at 7-8.  \nBut at the very least, if Petitioner’s arguments are \ndriven  by  concerns  about  potential  exposure  to \nnudity,  then  the  result  must  be  tailored  to  that \nconcern.  There  is  no  rational  reason  to  bar  all \ntransgender students from all restrooms regardless \nof  whether  students  get  undressed  in  front  of  one \nanother.  Title IX does not permit school boards to \nenact  categorical  rules  prohibiting  administrators \nfrom  allowing  any  transgender  student  to  use \nfacilities  consistent  with  their  gender  identity \nregardless  of  the  facts  of  any  particular  situation.   \nCf.  Carcaño,  2016  WL  4508192,  at  *15  (issuing \npreliminary  injunction  against  “blanket  ban  that \nforecloses  any  form  of  accommodation  for \ntransgender students other than separate facilities”). \nA  categorical  rule  excluding  transgender \nstudents  from  the  common  restrooms is  an  “overt, \nphysical  deprivation  of  access  to  school  resources” \nthat  violates  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulation, fairly construed.  Davis, 526 U.S. at 650.  \n“The  statute  makes  clear  that,  whatever  else  it \nprohibits,  students  must  not  be  denied  access  to \neducational benefits and opportunities on the basis of \ngender.”  Id.  That  simple  principle  is  enough  to \nresolve this case.  \n    33   \n\nB.  The  Department’s  Reasonable \nInterpretation  of  its  Own \nRegulation Is Worthy of Deference \nUnder Any Standard. \nThe Fourth Circuit resolved the appeal on the \nnarrowest available grounds by properly deferring to \nthe  Department’s  reasonable  interpretation  of  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.33.  In doing so, the Fourth Circuit did \nnot allow the Department to define the meaning of \nsex.  It independently interpreted the term “sex” to \ninclude all physiological, anatomical, and behavioral \naspects  of  a  person’s  sex,  and  then  deferred  to           \nthe  Department’s  judgment  of  how  to  “provide \nseparate toilet . . . facilities on the basis of sex” when \ndifferent aspects of a student’s sex diverge. 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33.  The Department concluded that allowing \ntransgender  students  to  use  restrooms  consistent \nwith their gender identity is the only way to “provide \nseparate toilet . . . facilities on the basis of sex” in a \nmanner consistent with the regulation’s premise that \nseparate restrooms for boys and girls do not deprive \nstudents of equal educational opportunity.  Id.  The \nFourth  Circuit  properly  deferred  to  that  policy \njudgment,  but  the  definition  of  “sex”  remains \nunchanged. \nSuch deference is particularly appropriate in \nlight  of  Title  IX’s  structure  and  the  role  of  the \nDepartment in administering the statute pursuant to \nan express delegation of authority.  See 20 U.S.C. § \n1682.  Title  IX  prohibits  all  forms  of  disparate \ntreatment  on  the  basis  of  sex  unless  specifically \nauthorized by one of the “narrow exceptions to that \nbroad  prohibition”  in  the  statutory  text  or \nimplementing regulations.  Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175.  \n    34   \n\nCongress included an exception in the text of Title IX \nallowing  schools  to  “maintain[]  separate  living \nfacilities for the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  \nBut  the  authority  to  provide  separate  restrooms—\nand  other  sex-segregated  activities—was  created \nthrough regulations.  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Without \nthe regulatory exception, separate restrooms would \n“fall[]  within Title  IX’s general  prohibition against \nsex discrimination.” Carcaño, 2016 WL 4508192, at \n*13.18 \nCongress  was  well  aware  that  the  statute \ndelegated  policy  questions  about  restrooms  to  the \nadministrative agency. During congressional debate, \nTitle IX’s sponsor, Senator Bayh, opposed a statutory \nexception  analogous  to  the  “bona  fide  occupational \nqualification” exception in Title VII “because all too \noften this is the hook on which discrimination can be \nhung.”  117  Cong.  Rec.  30407  (1971).  Instead,  he \nnoted  that  “the  rulemaking  powers  .  .  .  give  the \nSecretary discretion to take care of this particular \npolicy  problem.”  Id.;  accord  118  Cong.  Rec.  5807 \n(1972)  (Statement  of  Sen.  Bayh)  (“[R]egulations \nwould allow enforcing agencies to permit differential \ntreatment by sex . . . where personal privacy must be \npreserved.”).  The decision to permit sex-segregated \nrestrooms is thus “a creature of the Secretary’s own \nregulations.” Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 256 \n(2006).  The  Department  exercised  discretion  by \n                                                        \n18  The  Department  has  for  decades  provided  interpretative \nguidance for its regulations, and that guidance has consistently \nreceived  deference  in  light  of  Title  IX’s  broad  delegation  of \npower.  See, e.g., Biediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 691 F.3d 85, 96 \n(2d  Cir.  2012)  (discussing  longstanding  deference  to  policy \ninterpretation from 1979). \n    35   \n\npermitting  differential  treatment  in  the  context  of \nrestrooms in the first place, and it makes sense to \ndefer  to  the  Department’s  determination  of  what \npractices  are  consistent  with  that  policy  decision.   \nCf. City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 133 S. Ct. 1863, \n1876  (2013)  (The  question  is  “whether  Congress \nwould  have  intended  the  agency  to  resolve  the \nresulting ambiguity.  If so, deference is warranted.”). \nAs the agency charged with enforcing Title IX, \nthe  Department  of  Education  has  “a  body  of \nexperience  and  informed  judgment,”  that  would \nmerit  deference  even  under  the  less  deferential \nstandard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, \n139-40 (1944).  See Fed. Exp. Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 \nU.S. 389, 403 (2008).  From its nation-wide vantage, \nthe  Department  has  rested  its  judgment  on  the \ncollective  experiences  of  students,  school  districts, \nand school administrators across the country.   See \nDepartment of Education, Examples of Policies and \nEmerging Practices. As part of the Executive Branch, \nthe  Department  of  Education  is  also  politically \naccountable for its decisions, and Congress retains \nthe power to overrule the Department’s policies if it \nwishes to do so.  Cf. Holowecki, 552 U.S. at 403.   \nTitle  IX  entrusts  the  administrative  agency \nwith  responsibility  for  making  policy  judgments \nabout when to permit differential treatment on the \nbasis  of  sex.    The  Department  of  Education’s \nreasonable interpretation of its own regulation falls \nsquarely within that delegation of authority and is \nworthy of deference.  If Petitioner disagrees with the \nDepartment’s  judgment,  its  remedy  lies  with  the \npolitical branches, not this Court. \n    36   \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n      Respectfully Submitted, \nJoshua A.

In this case, a Department of Education offi-\ncial opined in an unpublished letter that Title IX’s pro-\nhibition  of  “sex”  discrimination  “include[s]  gender \nidentity,” and that a funding recipient providing sex-\nseparated facilities under the regulation “must gener-\nally treat transgender students consistent with their \ngender identity.” App. 128a, 100a. The Fourth Circuit \nafforded this letter “controlling” deference under the \ndoctrine of Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997). On \nremand the district court entered a preliminary in-\njunction requiring the petitioner school board to allow \nrespondent—who was born a girl but identifies as a \nboy—to use the boys’ restrooms at school. \nThe questions presented are:      \n1.  Should  Auer  deference  extend  to  an  un-\npublished agency letter that, among other things, does \nnot carry the force of law and was adopted in the con-\ntext of the very dispute in which deference is sought? \n2.  With or without deference to the agency, should \nthe Department’s specific interpretation of Title IX \nand 34 C.F.R. §106.33 be given effect? \n \n \n\n  ii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner  Gloucester  County  School  Board  was \nDefendant-Appellee in the court of appeals in No. 15-\n2056, and Defendant-Appellant in the court of appeals \nin No. 16-1733.  \nRespondent G.G., by his next friend and mother, \nDeirdre Grimm, was Plaintiff-Appellant in the court \nof appeals in No. 15-2056 and Plaintiff-Appellee in the \ncourt of appeals in No. 16-1733. \n \n \n\n  iii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions Presented ................................................... i \nParties to the Proceeding ........................................... ii \nTable of Authorities .................................................... vi \nIntroduction ................................................................. 1 \nOpinions Below ............................................................ 2 \nJurisdiction .................................................................. 3 \nStatutory and Regulatory Provisions Involved .......... 3 \nStatement of the Case ................................................. 4 \nA.

No one imagined, however, \nthat Title IX would erase all distinctions between men \nand women, nor dismantle expectations of privacy be-\ntween the sexes. That is why Title IX permits “sepa-\nrate living facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. \n§1686,  including  “separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower  facilities  on  the  basis  of  sex[.]”  34  C.F.R. \n§106.33. For over forty years, our Nation’s schools \nhave structured facilities around that sensible idea—\nnamely, that in intimate settings men and women \nmay be separated “to afford members of each sex pri-\nvacy from the other sex.” United States v. Virginia, \n518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996). \n\n  2 \nThe interpretation adopted by the Fourth Circuit \nturns that expectation upside down. Deferring to an \nunpublished letter written in January 2015 by a mid-\nlevel official in the Department of Education (“Depart-\nment”), the court reasoned that the term “sex” in Title \nIX does not mean the physiological distinctions be-\ntween males and females—which is what Congress \n(and everyone else) thought the term meant when Ti-\ntle IX was enacted and its regulations issued in the \nmid-1970s. Instead, we are now told that “sex” is am-\nbiguous as applied to persons whose gender identity \ndiverges  from  their  physiology.  According  to  the \nFourth Circuit, this means a physiologically female \nstudent who identifies as a male must be allowed to \nuse the boys’ restroom, and vice versa. It also means \nthat the policy of the petitioner Gloucester County \nSchool Board (“Board”)—which separates restrooms \nby physiological sex, while also providing unisex re-\nstrooms for all students—is prohibited by Title IX. \nThat preposterous interpretation is foreclosed by \nthe text, structure, and history of Title IX and its im-\nplementing regulation, and no amount of deference to \nan administrative agency can justify it. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThis Court has granted review of two related cases \nin the court of appeals, Nos. 15-2056 and 16-1733. No. \n15-2056 is G.G.’s appeal of the district court’s order \ndismissing the Title IX claim and denying a prelimi-\nnary injunction. The opinion of the court of appeals in \nthat case is available at 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016). \n \n \n\n  3 \nApp. 1a–60a. The district court’s opinion is available \nat 132 F. Supp. 3d 736 (E.D. Va. 2015). App. 84a–\n117a. \nNo. 16-1733 is the Board’s appeal of the district \ncourt’s order granting a preliminary injunction after \nthe remand in No. 15-2056. The district court’s opin-\nion is available at 2016 WL 3581852 (E.D. Va. June \n23, 2016). App. 71a–72a.  \nJURISDICTION \nIn No. 15-2056, the court of appeals entered its \njudgment on April 19, 2016. App. 3a. It denied the \nBoard’s petition for rehearing en banc on May 31, \n2016. App. 61a. No. 16-1733 remains pending in the \ncourt of appeals. The Board timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on August 29, 2016, see 28 U.S.C. §2101(c), and \nthis Court granted the writ on October 28, 2016. This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1254(1). \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 pro-\nvides, in relevant part: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto discrimination under any education pro-\ngram or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance[.] \n20 U.S.C. §1681(a).  \n \n \n\n  4 \nNotwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary \ncontained in this chapter, nothing contained \nherein shall be construed to prohibit any ed-\nucational institution receiving funds under \nthis Act, from maintaining separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes. \n20 U.S.C. §1686. \nDepartment of Education Title IX regulations pro-\nvide, in relevant part:  \nA  recipient  may  provide  separate  toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the ba-\nsis of sex, but such facilities provided for stu-\ndents of one sex shall be comparable to such \nfacilities provided for students of the other \nsex. \n34 C.F.R. §106.33. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background \nMarking Title IX’s fortieth anniversary in 2012, \nthe White House praised its “commonsense” prohibi-\ntion on sex discrimination in education and observed \nthat the law “marked a momentous shift for women’s \nequality in classrooms, on playing fields, and in com-\nmunities  throughout  our  nation.”1  That  is  exactly \n                                                 \n1   Obama Administration Commemorates 40 Years of Increas-\ning Equality and Opportunity for Women in Education and Ath-\nletics, White House, Office of the Press Sec’y (June 20, 2012). \n \n \n\n  5 \nright. In the words of its principal sponsor, Senator \nBirch Bayh of Indiana, Title IX aimed “a death blow” \nat “one of the great failings of the American educa-\ntional  system”—namely,  “corrosive  and  unjustified \ndiscrimination against women.” 118 Cong. Rec. 5809, \n5803. At the same time, however, Title IX carefully \npreserved settled expectations of privacy by permit-\nting “separate living facilities for the different sexes, \n20 U.S.C. §1686, and “separate toilet, locker room, \nand shower facilities on the basis of sex,” 34 C.F.R. \n§106.33 (“section 106.33”). That exception was “de-\nsigned,” as Senator Bayh explained, “to allow discrim-\nination only in instances where personal privacy must \nbe preserved.” 121 Cong. Rec. 16060. \n1.  Title IX prohibited sex discrimination \nas a means of ending educational dis-\ncrimination against women. \nTitle IX emerged from Congress’s multifaceted ef-\nforts  in  the  early  1970’s  to  address  discrimination \nagainst women. See generally Paul C. Sweeney, Abuse \nMisuse & Abrogation of the Use of Legislative History: \nTitle IX & Peer Sexual Harassment, 66 UMKC L. Rev. \n41, 50–54 (1997). Frustrated with lack of progress on \nthe Equal Rights Amendment (“ERA”), Senator Bayh \ndecided  to  pursue  its  goals  through  other  means. \nBirch Bayh, Personal Insights and Experiences Re-\ngarding the Passage of Title IX, 55 Clev. St. L. Rev. \n463, 467 (2007). Believing that the worst discrimina-\ntion against women was in “the educational area,” id. \nat 468, Bayh focused on the Higher Education Act of \n \n \n\n  6 \n1965, which granted money to universities. Sweeney, \nsupra,  at  51.  In  1972,  while  that  Act  was  being \namended, floor amendments added the text that is \nnow Title IX. See 117 Cong. Rec. 39098; 118 Cong. \nRec. 5802–03. \nThose amendments were principally motivated to \nend discrimination against women in university ad-\nmissions  and  appointments.  See  117  Cong.  Rec. \n39250, 39253, 39258; 118 Cong. Rec. 5104–06. Title \nIX’s architects viewed such discrimination as rooted \nin pernicious stereotypes about women. As Senator \nBayh vividly put it, “[w]e are all familiar with the ste-\nreotype of women as pretty things who go to college to \nfind a husband, go on to graduate school because they \nwant a more interesting husband, and finally marry, \nhave children, and never work again.” 118 Cong. Rec. \n5804. Title IX meant to extirpate such “myths about \nthe ‘weaker sex.’” Id.  \nIndeed, in the debates Senator Bayh used the term \n“sex  discrimination”  and  “discrimination  against \nwomen” as virtually interchangeable. See, e.g., 118 \nCong. Rec. 5803. House members did the same, ex-\nplaining that the legislation would afford “[w]omen … \n[an]  equal  opportunity  to  start  their  careers  on  a \nsound basis,” 117 Cong. Rec. 39253 (Rep. Sullivan), \nand that extending such protection to “women” would \nbe “[a]ll that this title does[.]” 117 Cong. Rep. 39259 \n(Rep. Green). \n \n \n\n  7 \n2.  Title IX allows certain facilities and pro-\ngrams to be separated by sex. \nAt the same time, Congress understood that not all \ndistinctions between men and women are based on \nstereotypes. Foremost among those are distinctions \nneeded to preserve privacy. As ERA proponents had \ngrasped, “disrobing in front of the other sex is usually \nassociated  with  sexual  relationships,”  Barbara  A. \nBrown, Thomas I. Emerson, Gail Falk, Ann E. Freed-\nman, The Equal Rights Amendment: A Constitutional \nBasis for Equal Rights for Women, 80 Yale L.J. 871, \n901 (1971), and thus implicated the recently-recog-\nnized right to privacy. See id. at 900–01 (citing Gris-\nwold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)). That pri-\nvacy right “would permit the separation of the sexes” \nin intimate facilities such as “public rest rooms[.]” Id. \nBoth  the  Senate  and  House  grasped  this  com-\nmonsense principle. For instance, Senator Bayh noted \nsex separation would be justified where “absolutely \nnecessary to the success of the program” such as “in \nclasses for pregnant girls,” and “in sports facilities or \nother instances where personal privacy must be pre-\nserved.” 118 Cong. Rec. 5807.2 Representative Thomp-\n                                                 \n2 When unsuccessfully introducing similar legislation the year \nbefore, Bayh observed that, by “provid[ing] equal [educational] \naccess for women and men students … [w]e are not requiring \nthat intercollegiate football be desegregated, nor that the men’s \nlocker room be desegregated.” 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (emphasis \nadded). \n \n \n\n  8 \nson—“disturbed” by suggestions that banning sex dis-\ncrimination  would  prohibit  all  sex-separated  facili-\nties—proposed an amendment stating that “nothing \ncontained herein shall preclude any educational insti-\ntution from maintaining separate living facilities be-\ncause of sex.” 117 Cong. Rec. 39260. The language was \nintroduced that day and adopted by the House with-\nout debate. 117 Cong. Rec. 39263. Although Bayh’s \nversion lacked a similar proviso, the conference com-\nmittee included Thompson’s language without further \ndiscussion. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1085 at 222.  \nSubsequently, the Department of Health, Educa-\ntion, and Welfare (“HEW”) proposed a Title IX regula-\ntion fleshing out the statute’s reference to “living fa-\ncilities.” See Comment, Implementing Title IX: The \nHEW Regulations, 124 U. Pa. L. Rev. 806, 811 (1976) \n(noting “living facilities” was ambiguous). The HEW \nregulation provided that living facilities would include \n“toilet, locker room and shower facilities.” HEW, 39 \nFed. Reg. 22228, 22230 (June 20, 1974). The final reg-\nulations  retained  HEW’s  definition.  HEW,  40  Fed. \nReg. 24128, 24141 (June 4, 1975); 34 C.F.R. §106.33.3 \n                                                 \n3  HEW’s regulations were recodified in their present form af-\nter the reorganization that created the Department of Education \nin 1980. See United States Dep’t of Educ., 45 Fed. Reg. 30802, \n30960 (May 9, 1980). Additionally, because multiple agencies is-\nsue Title IX regulations, the section 106.33 exception appears \nverbatim in 25 other regulations. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. §15a.33 (Ag-\nriculture); 24 C.F.R. §3.410 (Housing & Urban Development); 29 \nC.F.R. §36.410 (Labor); 38 C.F.R. §23.410 (Veterans Affairs); 40 \nC.F.R. §5.410 (EPA). \n \n \n\n  9 \nHEW’s  regulations  continued  to  use  the  statutory \nterm “sex,” without elaboration.  \nWhen Congress considered the HEW regulation on \n“living facilities,” Senator Bayh again linked the issue \nto privacy. He introduced into the record a scholarly \narticle explaining that Title IX “was designed to allow \ndiscrimination only in instances where personal pri-\nvacy must be preserved. For example, the privacy ex-\nception lies behind the exemption from the Act of cam-\npus  living  facilities.  The  proposed  regulations  pre-\nserve this exception, as well as permit ‘separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex.’” \n121 Cong. Rec. 16060. \nTitle IX regulations contain another relevant pro-\nvision for separation between male and female stu-\ndents, also based on physical differences. Funding re-\ncipients are prohibited from discriminating on the ba-\nsis of sex in athletic activities and must provide “equal \nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 \nC.F.R. §106.41(a), (c); HEW, 40 Fed. Reg. 24128 (June \n4, 1975). Nonetheless, they are permitted to establish \n“separate teams for members of each sex where selec-\ntion … is based upon competitive skill or the activity \ninvolved is a contact sport.” 34 C.F.R. §106.41(b).  \n3.  Title IX is enforced by multiple agencies \nthrough formal rules and clear notice. \nTitle IX is authorized by the Spending Clause, see \nFranklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 74 \n \n \n\n  10 \n(1992), and Congress has accordingly vested enforce-\nment responsibility with “[e]ach Federal department \nand agency … empowered to extend Federal financial \nassistance to any education program or activity[.]” 20 \nU.S.C. §1682. Those agencies may “effectuate” Title \nIX by “issu[ing] rules, regulations, or orders of general \napplicability,” and “[n]o such rule, regulation, or order \nshall become effective unless and until approved by \nthe President.” Id.; see also 20 U.S.C. §1232(f) (requir-\ning that certain Department acts be transmitted to \nleaders of Congress).  \nTitle IX may be enforced by terminating federal fi-\nnancial  support  to  noncompliant  institutions.  20 \nU.S.C. §1682. Agencies seeking to enforce Title IX in \nthat  way  must  comply  with  certain  procedural  re-\nquirements, including notice and opportunity for a \nhearing, and must provide written reports on the ter-\nmination to Congress. Id. \nB.  Factual Background \nG.G. is a 17-year-old student at Gloucester High \nSchool who was born female. JA61, 64.4 According to \nG.G., however, “I was born in the wrong sex.” App. \n151a. In April 2014, a psychologist diagnosed G.G. \nwith gender dysphoria, a condition involving “incon-\ngruence between a person’s gender identity” and birth \nsex. JA64–65. G.G. defines “gender identity” as one’s \n“innate sense of being male or female,” in contrast to \n                                                 \n4   These factual allegations are taken from G.G.’s complaint \nand declaration. JA61–79; App. 146a–152a. \n \n \n\n  11 \none’s “sex … assigned at birth.” JA64. G.G. was ad-\nvised  to  “transition”  to  a  male  gender  identity  by \nadopting a male name and “us[ing] … the [boys’] re-\nstroom.” JA66. G.G. has since legally adopted a male \nname, but has not undergone any genital surgery and \nis still anatomically female. JA89.5     \nIn August 2014, before the 2014–15 school year be-\ngan, G.G. and G.G.’s mother met with the Gloucester \nHigh School principal and guidance counselor. App. \n148a. The officials “expressed support for [G.G.] and a \nwillingness to ensure a welcoming environment.” Id. \nRecords were changed to reflect G.G.’s male name, \nand teachers were told that G.G. was to be addressed \nby a male name and pronouns. G.G. was also permit-\nted to continue with a home-bound physical education \nprogram, which meant G.G. did not need to use the \nschool’s locker room. App. 149a. \nG.G. initially agreed to use a separate restroom, \nbeing  “unsure  how  other  students  would  react  to \n[G.G.’s] transition.” Id. However, after two months \nG.G.  “found  it  stigmatizing  to  use  a  separate  re-\nstroom” and “determined that it was not necessary” to \n                                                 \n5   G.G.’s brief opposing certiorari claimed that, “in June 2016, \nG. had chest reconstruction surgery.” Opp. 5–6 n.5. Since certio-\nrari was granted, G.G.’s counsel has informed the Board’s coun-\nsel that the sex designation on G.G.’s Virginia birth certificate \nhas been changed from “female” to “male.” These developments \ndo not appear in the record before this Court, and thus are not \nproper grounds for decision. Witters v. Wash. Dep’t of Servs. for \nthe Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 486 n. 3 (1986).   \n \n \n\n  12 \ndo so. Id. The principal allowed G.G. to use the boys’ \nrestroom beginning on October 20, 2014. Id.  \nThe next day, the Board began receiving numerous \ncomplaints from parents and students who regarded \nG.G.’s presence in the boys’ restroom as an invasion of \nstudent privacy. App. 144a; Pet. 6. The Board consid-\nered the problem and, after two public meetings on \nNovember 11 and December 9, 2014, adopted the fol-\nlowing policy:  \nWhereas the GCPS [Gloucester County Pub-\nlic Schools] recognizes that some students \nquestion their gender identities, and \nWhereas  the  GCPS  encourages  such  stu-\ndents to seek support, advice, and guidance \nfrom  parents,  professionals  and  other \ntrusted adults, and \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to pro-\nvide male and female restroom and locker \nroom facilities in its schools, and the use of \nsaid facilities shall be limited to the corre-\nsponding  biological  genders,  and  students \nwith gender identity issues shall be provided \nan alternative appropriate private facility.  \nId. \n \n \n\n  13 \nBefore the Board adopted this resolution, the high \nschool announced it would install three single-stall \nunisex bathrooms,  regardless of whether the Board \napproved  the  December  9  resolution.  JA71–72,  73. \nThese unisex restrooms—which were available on De-\ncember 16—would be open to all students who, for \nwhatever reason, desire greater privacy. App. 144a–\n145a. G.G. refuses to use them, however, claiming \nthey make G.G. feel “stigmatized and isolated.” App. \n151a. G.G. acknowledges that male classmates may \nbe “uncomfortable” using the restroom with G.G., but \nasserts that they should “avail [themselves] of the re-\ncently installed single stall bathrooms.” JA75. \nC.  Procedural History \n1.  The Ferg-Cadima letter \nOn December 14, 2014, five days after the Board \npassed its resolution, a lawyer sent an e-mail to the \nDepartment asking whether it had any “guidance or \nrules” relevant to the Board’s resolution. App. 119a. \nOn January 7, 2015, James A. Ferg-Cadima, an Act-\ning Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy in the De-\npartment’s Office of Civil Rights, sent a letter in re-\nsponse. App. 121a (“Ferg-Cadima letter”). \nThe Ferg-Cadima letter stated that “Title IX … \nprohibits  recipients  of  Federal  financial  assistance \nfrom discriminating on the basis of sex, including gen-\nder identity.” App. 121a (emphases added). The letter \nacknowledged that Title IX and its regulations “per-\nmit schools to provide sex-segregated restrooms locker \n \n \n\n  14 \nrooms, shower facilities, housing, athletic teams, and \nsingle-sex classes under certain circumstances,” App. \n123a, while providing the following guidance as to \nthose circumstances: \nWhen a school elects to separate or treat stu-\ndents differently on the basis of sex in those \nsituations,  a  school  generally  must  treat \ntransgender  students  consistent  with  their \ngender identity.  \nId.  \nThe Ferg-Cadima letter cited no agency document \nrequiring schools to treat transgender students “con-\nsistent  with  their  gender  identity”  regarding  re-\nstroom, locker room, or shower access. Instead it cited \na  Department  Q&A  sheet,  which  says  only  that \nschools must treat transgender students consistent \nwith their gender identity when holding single-sex \nclasses. See United States Department of Education, \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex El-\nementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular \nActivities  (Dec.  1,  2014),  http://bit.ly/1HRS6yI  (em-\nphasis added) (Q&A #31) (opining “[h]ow ... the Title \nIX  requirements  on  single-sex  classes  apply  to \ntransgender students) (emphasis added). \n2.  District Court proceedings \nG.G. sued the Board on June 11, 2015, six months \nafter the Board passed its resolution, claiming the \nBoard’s policy violates the Equal Protection Clause \n \n \n\n  15 \nand Title IX. JA75–78. G.G. sought declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. JA78. \nG.G. moved for a preliminary injunction on June \n18, 2015. ECF 18. With respect to Title IX, G.G. ar-\ngued that section 106.33 does not allow a school to “as-\nsign transgender boys to the girls’ room,” and that Ti-\ntle IX therefore requires giving G.G. access to the \nboys’ restroom. Id. at 37. G.G. reiterated that “gender \nidentity” means “one’s sense of oneself as male or fe-\nmale,” id. at 1, or “the conviction of belonging to a par-\nticular gender,” id. at 2, and asserted further that \n“[f]rom a medical perspective, there is no distinction \nbetween an individual’s gender identity and his or her \n‘biological’ sex or gender.” Id. at 17 n.13. G.G. also \ncited the Department’s purported position that Title \nIX  requires  access  to  sex-separated  facilities  con-\nsistent with gender identity and urged the district \ncourt to defer to that position under Auer. Id. at 38.  \nOn June 29, 2015, the United States filed a “state-\nment of interest” in support of G.G., arguing that “pro-\nhibiting a student from accessing the restrooms that \nmatch his gender identity is prohibited sex discrimi-\nnation under Title IX.” App. 160a, 162a. The United \nStates did not cite section 106.33, nor explain how the \nBoard’s policy could be unlawful under the regulation. \nInstead, it relied on the Ferg-Cadima letter as the \n \n \n\n  16 \n“controlling”  interpretation  of  Title  IX  and  section \n106.33. See App. 172a.6 \nWithout ruling on the equal protection claim, the \ndistrict court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim and de-\nnied a preliminary injunction. App. 82a–83a (order); \n84a–117a (opinion). First, the district court held that \nthe Title IX claim was “precluded by Department of \nEducation  regulations”—specifically  section 106.33. \nApp. 97a–98a. The court reasoned that section 106.33 \nallows separation of restrooms by “sex” and, “[u]nder \nany fair reading, ‘sex’ in section 106.33 clearly in-\ncludes biological sex.” App. 99a. The court thus con-\ncluded that the Board’s policy of “providing separate \nbathrooms on the basis of biological sex is permissible \nunder the regulation,” regardless of whether “sex” en-\ncompasses “gender identity,” as G.G. urged. Id. \nSecond, the district court refused to give control-\nling weight to the Ferg-Cadima letter. The district \ncourt observed that letters of this sort lack the force of \nlaw under Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, \n587  (2000),  and  cannot  receive  Chevron  deference \n                                                 \n6  The United States cited two other Department documents, \nbut neither addresses whether schools must allow students into \nrestrooms or locker rooms corresponding with their gender iden-\ntity. See App. 170a–172a (citing United States Department of \nEducation, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Vio-\nlence (April 29, 2014), and United States Department of Educa-\ntion, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elemen-\ntary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities); see \nalso supra at 15. \n \n \n\n  17 \nwhen interpreting Title IX. App. 101a; see Chevron \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837 (1984). The Court also held that the letter should \nnot receive deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. \n452 (1997), because it would prevent school districts \nfrom establishing separate restrooms “on the basis of \nsex,” as section 106.33 “clearly allows.” App. 102a.  \n3.  Fourth Circuit appeal in No. 15-2056 \nThe Fourth Circuit  reversed the district court’s \ndismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim, holding that the dis-\ntrict court should have accepted the Ferg-Cadima let-\nter as the “controlling” construction of Title IX and \nsection 106.33 under Auer. App. 13a–25a.  \nFirst, the panel held that section 106.33 was “am-\nbiguous” as applied to “whether a transgender indi-\nvidual is a male or a female for the purpose of access \nto sex-segregated restrooms,” and that the Ferg-Ca-\ndima letter “resolve[d]” this ambiguity by determining \nsex solely “by reference to … gender identity.” Id. at \n19a–20a, 18a. \nSecond, the panel held that the letter’s interpreta-\ntion—“although perhaps not the intuitive one,” id. at \n23a—was not, in the words of Auer, “plainly erroneous \nor inconsistent with the regulation or the statute.” Id \nat 20a, 22a–23a. In the panel’s view, the term “sex” \ndoes not necessarily suggest “a hard-and-fast binary \ndivision [of males and females] on the basis of repro-\nductive organs.” Id. at 22a. \n \n \n\n  18 \nThird, the panel found that the letter’s interpreta-\ntion  constituted  the  agency’s  “fair  and  considered \njudgment,” because the agency had consistently en-\nforced this position “since 2014”—that is, for the pre-\nvious several months—and it was “in line with” other \nagency guidance. Id. at 24a. While conceding the in-\nterpretation was “novel,” given “there was no inter-\npretation  of  how  section 106.33  applied  to  trans-\ngender individuals before January 2015,” the panel \nnonetheless thought this novelty was no reason to \ndeny Auer deference. Id. at 23a.7 \nThe Board moved for rehearing en banc, which was \ndenied on May 31, 2016. Id. at 61a–66a. The Board \nthen asked for a stay of the Fourth Circuit’s mandate \npending its filing a certiorari petition. This too was de-\nnied, again over Judge Niemeyer’s dissent. Id. at 67a–\n70a. The mandate in No. 15-2056 issued on June 17, \n2016.8 \n                                                 \n7  Judge Niemeyer dissented for many of the reasons given by \nthe district court. App. 40a–60a. \n8   On May 13, 2016, the Departments of Education and Justice \nissued a “Dear Colleague” letter elaborating on the Ferg-Cadima \nletter. See Pet. 14–15. Challenges to the Dear Colleague letter by \nnumerous States, see id. at 15–16, have resulted in a nationwide \npreliminary injunction against the Departments. See Texas v. \nUnited States, __ F.Supp.3d __, 2016 WL 4426495 (N.D. Tex. \nAug. 21, 2016), on appeal, Texas v. United States, No. 16-11534 \n(5th Cir.). A similar lawsuit in Nebraska has been stayed pend-\ning this case. See Nebraska v. United States, No. 4:16-cv-03117, \nECF No. 24 (D. Neb. Nov. 23, 2016).  \n(continued…) \n \n \n\n  19 \n4.  Proceedings after remand \nOn remand, the district court entered a prelimi-\nnary injunction without taking additional briefing or \nevidence. App. 71a–72a. The injunction ordered the \nBoard to permit G.G. to use the boys’ restroom at \nGloucester High School. Id. at 72a. The Board ap-\npealed this order, creating a second case in the Fourth \nCircuit, No. 16-1733. The Board’s request to stay the \ninjunction pending appeal was denied by the district \ncourt, App. 73a–75a, and the Fourth Circuit, again \nover Judge Niemeyer’s dissent. App. 76a–81a. \nFinally, the Board asked this Court to recall and \nstay the Fourth Circuit’s mandate in No. 15-2056, and \nto  stay  the  district  court’s  preliminary  injunction, \npending  this  certiorari  petition.  That  request  was \ngranted on August 3, 2016. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd. \nv. G.G., 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016) (per curiam). The Board \ntimely petitioned for a writ of certiorari on three ques-\ntions, which this Court granted as to questions two \nand three. Order, Oct. 28, 2016. In this brief, these \nquestions have been renumbered as questions one and \ntwo, respectively. \n                                                 \n  Separately, the Department of Health & Human Services is-\nsued Affordable Care Act regulations interpreting Title IX in the \nsame way as the Ferg-Cadima letter. Those regulations were pre-\nliminarily enjoined last week. See Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. \nBurwell, No. 7:16-cv-00108, ECF No. 62 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 31, 2016) \n(enjoining aspects of 45 C.F.R. pt. 92).  \n \n \n\n  20 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe interpretation of Title IX and its implement-\ning regulation adopted by the Fourth Circuit would \nupend the ingrained practices of nearly every school \nin the Nation on a matter of basic privacy and dig-\nnity—whether separate restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers may be provided for boys and girls, as defined \nby their physical sexual attributes. \nThe  majority  deemed  “controlling”  an  agency’s \nview that “sex” in Title IX turns, not on physiological \ndistinctions between males and females, but on “gen-\nder identity”—meaning one’s internal perception of \nbeing male or female. That profoundly mistaken view \nwould  outlaw  the  (until  now)  universally  accepted \npractice of separating restrooms, locker rooms, show-\ners, athletic teams, and dormitory rooms based on \nphysiological differences between the sexes. It would \nalso transform Title IX’s straightforward prohibition \non “sex” discrimination into a different prohibition on \n“gender  identity”  discrimination  which  Congress \nnever contemplated or enacted. The Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision cannot stand. This Court should reverse on \neither of two distinct grounds. \nI. Most fundamentally, the Court should reverse \nbecause no matter what level of deference is given to \nthe agency, the interpretation of Title IX and its reg-\nulation adopted by the Fourth Circuit is wrong. \nA. The Board’s policy is plainly valid under the Ti-\ntle IX regulation at issue—section 106.33—which has \n \n \n\n  21 \nlong permitted separation of restrooms by “sex.” In-\ndeed, the Board went above and beyond the accommo-\ndation section 106.33 contemplates by providing addi-\ntional unisex restrooms for any student who desires \ngreater privacy for whatever reason. \nTo invalidate the Board’s policy under Title IX, the \nFourth Circuit adopted a view that equates the term \n“sex” entirely with “gender identity,” effectively com-\npelling schools to disregard the very physiological dif-\nferences that justify separation in the first place. That \ncannot be right as a matter of Title IX’s text, history, \nand structure. \nAll  indicators  of  statutory  meaning  show  that \nwhen Title IX was enacted, Congress understood “sex” \nto refer to physiological distinctions between men and \nwomen. Title IX-era dictionaries unanimously defined \nsex based on those physical characteristics, and mod-\nern dictionaries overwhelmingly do the same. None \ntreats gender identity as determinative of sex. \nNeither does Title IX’s legislative history. While \nseeking to end discrimination against women, Title \nIX’s architects deliberately allowed separation of the \nsexes to protect privacy—an interest rooted in physi-\ncal differences between the sexes that would be nulli-\nfied by equating sex with gender identity.  \nB. The Fourth Circuit’s interpretation would also \nundermine Title IX’s structure and purposes. Requir-\ning schools to evaluate access to intimate facilities \nbased on gender identity rather than physiological dif-\nferences would lead them either to (1) abandon sex-\n \n \n\n  22 \nseparated facilities altogether, or (2) undertake case-\nby-case evaluations of a student’s gender presenta-\ntion. \nThe first approach would nullify the privacy safe-\nguards envisioned by Title IX’s proponents and ex-\npressly provided in the statute and implementing reg-\nulation. The second approach would be impossible to \nadminister and, in any event, would ironically incen-\ntivize  sex-stereotyping  discrimination  outlawed  by \nthe Constitution and federal anti-discrimination law. \nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250–51 \n(1989) (plurality opinion). Making sex turn on gender \nidentity, furthermore, poses a threat to female-only \nathletic teams, one of Title IX’s signal achievements. \nC. Even assuming Title IX theoretically permitted \nthe interpretation adopted by the Fourth Circuit, it \nwould surely come as a surprise to four decades of Ti-\ntle IX recipients. That has constitutional significance: \nas a Spending Clause statute, Title IX must give fair \nnotice of its conditions. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. \nof  Educ.  v.  Murphy,  548  U.S.  291,  296  (2006); \nPennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981). The latent possibility that schools \nwould be required to treat sex as equivalent to gender \nidentity, on pain of losing federal funding, would of-\nfend that clear-notice requirement. This Court should \ninterpret Title IX to avoid this constitutional problem.  \nII. Alternatively, the Court may reverse because \nthe Fourth Circuit should not have extended Auer def-\nerence to the agency interpretation.  \n \n \n\n  23 \n A. Auer deference applies only when an agency in-\nterprets its own regulations. The Ferg-Cadima letter, \nhowever, turns on what the agency thinks Title IX it-\nself requires, not merely on what the regulatory lan-\nguage means. But even indulging the assumption that \nthe  letter  interprets  the  regulatory  language,  that \nlanguage merely parrots Title IX by importing the \nterm “sex” directly from the statute. This Court has \nheld that agencies cannot claim Auer deference when \nthey  interpret  regulatory  terms  that  come  directly \nfrom statutes. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 247 \n(2006). \nB. Assuming Auer deference applies, it only aids \nagencies when regulatory language is ambiguous and \nthe agency clarifies it in a permissible way. Christen-\nsen, 529 U.S. at 588. But for many of the same reasons \nthat Title IX forecloses the agency’s interpretation, \nthe regulations do as well. “Sex” is not an ambiguous \nterm: as used in Title IX, it plainly refers to physiolog-\nical differences between men and women. And reading \n“sex” as depending on gender identity is not a permis-\nsible interpretive choice in any event. \nC. Finally, Auer deference is inapplicable because \nthe Department ignored procedural requirements for \nacting with the force of law. This Court has held that \nagency interpretations of statutes merit Chevron def-\nerence only when agencies act with the force of law by \nemploying relatively formal procedures. United States \nv. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001); Christensen, 529 \nU.S. at 588. That rule ensures agencies can only bind \n \n \n\n  24 \ncourts and regulated parties through methods Con-\ngress  provided.  This  Court  has  implied  that  Auer \nshould be limited in a similar way, and should now so \nhold.  \nEven if Auer might apply to some informal agency \nacts, it should not apply here. Congress has required \nspecific processes, including but not limited to those \nin the Administrative Procedure Act, that the Depart-\nment must follow if it seeks to act with the force of \nlaw. See 20 U.S.C. §1682. The Ferg-Cadima letter was \nnot issued pursuant to those procedures and should \ntherefore not control in court. \nARGUMENT \nIn agreeing to review the Fourth Circuit’s decision, \nthis Court granted certiorari on two questions: (1) \nwhether the Fourth Circuit properly deferred to the \nagency’s interpretation under Auer v. Robbins, 519 \nU.S. 452 (1997), Pet. 25–32, and (2) whether—regard-\nless of Auer—that interpretation was correct. Pet. 33–\n38; see also id. at 33 (arguing the agency’s “interpre-\ntation  is  flatly  wrong”).  This  brief  addresses  these \nquestions in reverse order for two reasons. \nFirst, understanding how Title IX addresses sex-\nseparated  facilities  illuminates  why  Auer  never \nshould have applied. For instance, it is not ambiguous \nwhether Title IX and section 106.33 permit separate \nrestrooms based on physiological differences between \nthe sexes—they plainly do—which removes the prem-\nise for applying Auer.  \n \n \n\n  25 \nSecond, a new administration will take office on \nJanuary 20, 2017. This raises the possibility that the \nguidance on which the Fourth Circuit relied will be \naltered or rescinded. Even that development, how-\never, would leave the question of whether the under-\nlying interpretation was correct. See, e.g., Pet. Reply \n1 (asking Court to resolve “the proper interpretation \nof Title IX and its implementing regulation”). This \nCourt can—and should—resolve that distinct ques-\ntion, apart from whether Auer should have applied. \nThat is because the meaning of Title IX and section \n106.33 on this issue is plain and may be resolved as a \nmatter of straightforward interpretation, instead of \nremanding for needless additional litigation in the \nlower courts. \nI.  The Board’s Policy Separating Restrooms \nBy Physiological Sex Is Plainly Valid Un-\nder Title IX And Section 106.33. \nThe Fourth Circuit accepted an interpretation of \nTitle IX and its implementing regulation that conclu-\nsively determines “sex” according to “gender identity,” \nmeaning the internal perception of oneself as male or \nfemale. App. 15a–16a, 20a. That interpretation is un-\nambiguously precluded by the text, history, and struc-\nture of Title IX and its implementing regulation and \nshould be rejected by this Court. \n \n \n\n  26 \nA. The Text And History Of Title IX And Sec-\ntion 106.33 Refute The Notion That “Sex” \nCan Be Equated With “Gender Identity.” \n The most straightforward way to resolve the in-\nterpretive question in this case is the one taken by the \ndistrict court. See App. 97a–100a. As that court cor-\nrectly explained, the Title IX regulation at issue—sec-\ntion 106.33—“specifically allows schools to maintain \nseparate bathrooms based on sex as long as the bath-\nrooms for each sex are comparable.” App. 99a. That \nregulation confirms the legality of the Board’s policy \nunder Title IX, regardless of whether the term “sex” \nmay include some notion of a person’s “gender iden-\ntity.” See id. (concluding that, because Board’s policy \nis permitted by the regulation, “the Court need not de-\ncide whether ‘sex’ in … [s]ection 106.33 also includes \n‘gender identity’”). \nAs the district court explained, it is beyond dispute \nthat the agency that adopted section 106.33 in the \nmid-1970s understood “sex,” at a minimum, to include \nphysiological distinctions between men and women. \nSee App. 99a (observing, “[u]nder any fair reading, \n‘sex’  in  [s]ection  106.33  clearly  includes  biological \nsex”). Indeed, as discussed below, all relevant indicia \nof  meaning  show  that  the  understanding  of  “sex” \nshared by Title IX’s architects was wholly determined \nby those physiological distinctions. Yet the position \naccepted by the Fourth Circuit majority implies the \nopposite: that one’s internal, perceived sense of gen-\nder identity is determinative when it diverges from \n \n \n\n  27 \nphysiological sex. See App. 20a (accepting as a “plau-\nsible” reading one that “determin[es] maleness or fe-\nmaleness with reference to gender identity”). Practi-\ncally speaking, this means that physiological sex is \nnot only irrelevant but invalid under Title IX as a gen-\neral basis for classification. To put the matter most \nstarkly, the interpretation accepted by the Fourth Cir-\ncuit forbids something the statute and regulation per-\nmit: using physiological sex to separate boys and girls \nin restrooms.  \n1.  The linguistic evidence found in dictionary def-\ninitions confirms that the term “sex” in Title IX and \nsection 106.33 turns overwhelmingly on the physio-\nlogical differences between men and women. Those \nsources provide no support for the notion adopted by \nthe Fourth Circuit that “sex” equates with “gender \nidentity,” to the exclusion of physiology. \nThe panel majority and Judge Niemeyer’s dissent \ncited nine dictionaries between them, covering a pe-\nriod from before the enactment of Title IX to the pre-\nsent day. Every single one referred to physiological \ncharacteristics as a criterion for distinguishing men \nfrom women. App. 21a–22a (majority) (citing Ameri-\ncan College Dictionary 1109 (1970), Webster’s Third \nNew  International  Dictionary  2081  (1971),  Black’s \nLaw Dictionary 1583 (10th ed. 2014), and American \nHeritage Dictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011)); App. 54a–\n55a (dissent) (citing The Random House College Dic-\ntionary 1206 (rev. ed. 1980), Webster’s New Collegiate \nDictionary 1054 (1979), American Heritage Dictionary \n \n \n\n  28 \n1187 (1976), Webster’s Third New International Dic-\ntionary 2081 (1971), The American College Dictionary \n1109 (1970), Webster’s New World College Dictionary \n1331 (5th ed. 2014); The American Heritage Diction-\nary 1605 (5th ed. 2011), and Merriam-Webster’s Colle-\ngiate Dictionary 1140 (11th ed. 2011)).  \nFor instance, the majority’s dictionary definitions \ninclude concepts such as “anatomical,” “physiological,” \nand  “morphological”  differences;  “biparental  repro-\nduction”; and “sex chromosomes.” App. 21a. Similarly, \nthe  dissent’s  definitions  include  concepts  such  as \n“structural” differences, “reproductive functions,” and \n“reproductive organs.” App. 54a–55a. The fact that \n“even today, the term ‘sex’ continues to be defined \nbased on the physiological distinctions between males \nand females” strongly suggests that is what the term \nmeant in the 1970s-era statute and regulation. App. \n55a (Niemeyer, J., dissenting). \nNevertheless, the majority found ambiguity in cer-\ntain definitions of “sex,” observing that the definitions \nin two dictionaries contemporary with Title IX “used \nqualifiers such as references to the ‘sum of’ various \nfactors,  ‘typical  dichotomous  occurrence,’  and  ‘typi-\ncally manifested as maleness and femaleness.’” App. \n22a. The majority failed to read those supposed “qual-\nifiers” in context. \nFor instance, the majority pointed out that the \nAmerican  College  Dictionary  (1970)  and  Webster’s \nThird New International Dictionary (1971) referenced \n \n \n\n  29 \nthe “‘sum of’ various factors” bearing on sex. Id. (em-\nphasis in maj. op.). But the panel overlooked that the \n“factors” to be “sum[med]” up consist of “anatomical \nand physiological differences” (in the former diction-\nary) and “‘the morphological, physiological, and be-\nhavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserve[ ] \nbiparental reproduction’” (in the latter). App. 21a (em-\nphasis added). The reference in Webster’s to “typical” \nsex characteristics, meanwhile, appears to refer to the \nusual range of expression of those characteristics, ra-\nther than acknowledging the existence of alternative \ndefinitions of sex. App. 21a–22a. In other words, what-\never “factors” might be relevant and whatever varia-\ntion from the “typical” case might exist, both diction-\naries confirm that physiological characteristics—and \nthose related to “reproduction” in particular—are the \noverriding consideration. \nThe majority nonetheless argued that where “the \nvarious indicators of sex … diverge,” these dictionary \ndefinitions “shed little light on how exactly to deter-\nmine” whether a person is male or female. App. 22a. \nBut that is false: as discussed above, the 1970s-era \ndefinitions relied on by the majority distinguish men \nfrom women based on physical characteristics. More \nimportantly, for the majority’s point to have any rele-\nvance to this case, a person’s perceived gender iden-\ntity would have to have been considered an “indica-\ntor[ ] of sex” that can contradict other “indicators”—\n \n \n\n  30 \nand no dictionary definition contemporary with Title \nIX suggested that it was.9 \nTo be sure, the majority cited three dictionaries \nthat referred to non-physiological factors in defining \nsex: two that included “behavioral peculiarities” or \n“gender” as an aspect of sex, see App. 21a–22a (quot-\ning  Webster’s  Third  New  International  Dictionary \n2081, and Black’s Law Dictionary 1583), and one that \n“includes in the definition of ‘sex’ ‘[o]ne’s identity as \neither female or male,’” App. 22a (quoting American \nHeritage Dictionary  1605). However, the majority’s \neditions of Black’s and American Heritage were pub-\nlished in 2014 and 2011, respectively, and have little \nprobative value as applied to Congress’s understand-\ning of language enacted in the mid-1970s. See, e.g., \nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. \n218, 228 (1994) (rejecting reliance on a dictionary “not \nyet even contemplated” when statute was enacted); \nSt. Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 610–13 \n(1987) (defining “race” according to dictionaries and \n                                                 \n9  The majority cited various circumstances where physiologi-\ncal sex is supposedly more difficult to settle, such as someone \nwho had “sex-reassignment surgery,” an “intersex individual,” \nsomeone “born with X-X-Y sex chromosomes,” or someone “who \nlost external genitalia in an accident.” App. 20a. Regardless of \nhow these particular cases would be settled under Title IX, none \ninvolves the situation where a person’s perceived gender identity \nis determinative of sex, regardless of physiology.  \n(continued…) \n \n \n\n  31 \nencyclopedias existing “when [42 U.S.C.] §1981 be-\ncame law in the 19th century”).10 Even if modern dic-\ntionaries were probative, not even the 2011 American \nHeritage Dictionary went as far as G.G.’s position that \none’s perceived “identity” overrides physiological sex. \nAnd if it did, that dictionary would have exactly the \nsame problem that the Fourth Circuit and the Ferg-\nCadima  letter  created,  namely,  a  gender  identity-\nbased definition of “sex” that swallows up all other \ndefinitions. This Court has rejected proposed interpre-\ntations derived from a “meaning set forth in a single \ndictionary … which not only supplements the meaning \ncontained in all other dictionaries, but contradicts one \nof the meanings contained in virtually all other dic-\ntionaries.” MCI Telecomms., 512 U.S. at 227.  \nOf those three dictionaries, only Webster’s Third \nNew International Dictionary, published in 1971, was \ncontemporary with Title IX. App. 21a–22a. But its def-\ninition of “sex”—based on a combination of “morpho-\nlogical, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities”—\ndoes not include gender identity at all.11 Nor could it: \n                                                 \n10   Furthermore, even Black’s primary definition of “sex” turns \non physiology. See App. 22a (noting Black’s first definition as \n“[t]he sum of the peculiarities of structure and function that dis-\ntinguish a male from a female organism”).  \n11  Moreover, even assuming the dictionary suggests that purely \n“behavioral peculiarities” are an aspect of “sex” in a linguistic \nsense, incorporating those “peculiarities” into Title IX would vi-\nolate the law. This Court’s decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hop-\nkins recognizes that discrimination on the basis of conformity \n(continued…) \n \n \n\n  32 \nas already explained, the various factors identified in \nthe definition are limited to those that “subserve[ ] \nbiparental reproduction,” and so could hardly refer to \nthe internal perception of oneself as male or female. \nIn short, the majority had no linguistic basis for \nholding that the term “sex” in Title IX could have been \nunderstood to refer to gender identity rather than the \nobjective physiological characteristics distinguishing \nmen from women—much less make gender identity \noverride those physiological characteristics. See also \nBrief of Amici Members of Congress. \n2.  Title IX’s legislative history, which the panel \nmajority did not address, confirms the dictionary def-\ninitions. See, e.g., St. Francis Coll., 481 U.S. at 612–\n13 (confirming textual meaning through legislative \nhistory). Congress’s manifest purpose in Title IX was \nto fix the pervasive problem of discrimination against \nwomen in educational programs. Title IX’s proponents \nwere consequently focused on prohibiting “sex” dis-\ncrimination, see 118 Cong. Rec. 5803; 117 Cong. Rep. \n39251,  but  at  the  same  time  sought  to  preserve \nschools’ ability to separate males and females to pre-\nserve  “personal  privacy,”  see  118  Cong.  Rec.  5807 \n                                                 \nwith sex stereotypes is a form of sex discrimination. 490 U.S. at \n250. Schools thus cannot consider “behavioral peculiarities” in \ndetermining whether someone is male or female. \n(continued…) \n \n \n\n  33 \n(Sen. Bayh).12 See supra at 6–10. Not a shred of legis-\nlative history suggests that Congress considered “gen-\nder identity” at all, much less that the concept could \nsupplant physiology. Nor is there any evidence that \nHEW  considered  “sex”  to  include  gender  identity \nwhen section 106.33 was promulgated. Even G.G. has \nindicated that the Congress that enacted Title IX and \nthe agency that adopted section 106.33 were focused \non physiological sex and never conceived of gender \nidentity. Opp. 1. That effectively concedes that the po-\nsition adopted by the Fourth Circuit transforms the \nstatutory prohibition from one that protects women \nagainst discrimination vis-à-vis men (and vice versa), \ninto one concerned with the quite different issue of \n“gender  identity”  discrimination.  See  also  Brief  of \nAmici William Bennett et al. \n3.  Other  indications  of  congressional  purpose \npoint in the same direction. For example, the subse-\nquently  enacted  Violence  Against  Women  Act \n(“VAWA”)—a Spending Clause statute, like Title IX—\nprohibits funded programs or activities from discrim-\ninating based on either “sex” or “gender identity.” 42 \nU.S.C. §13925(b)(13)(A). “Sex” and “gender identity” \nmust have meant distinct things to the Congress that \nenacted VAWA, for equating sex with gender identity \nwould create surplusage. See, e.g., National Credit \n                                                 \n12   This Court has considered “Senator Bayh’s remarks, as those \nof the sponsor of the language ultimately enacted” as Title IX, to \nbe “an authoritative guide to the statute’s construction.”  N. Ha-\nven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 526–27 (1982). \n \n \n\n  34 \nUnion Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Tr. Co., 522 U.S. \n479, 501 (1998) (rejecting agency interpretation under \nChevron for this reason).  \nOther statutes enacted after Title IX relate to dis-\ncriminatory acts based on “gender” and “gender iden-\ntity,” implying Congress distinguished outward man-\nifestations of sexual identity—akin to sex—from in-\nward, perceived ones. 18 U.S.C. §249 (federal hate \ncrimes); 42 U.S.C. §3716(a)(1)(C) (Attorney General \nauthority to assist with State and local investigations \nand prosecutions); 20 U.S.C. §1092(f)(1)(F)(ii) (crime \nreporting by universities).  \nNot only is a separate provision for gender identity \nabsent from the text of Title IX, but in other contexts \nCongress has repeatedly declined to enact statutes \nforbidding gender identity discrimination in educa-\ntion. The Student Non-Discrimination Act, introduced \nin 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015 in both the Senate and \nthe House,13 would condition school funding on pro-\nhibiting  gender  identity  discrimination.  Another \nmeasure, the “Equality Act,” would amend the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 to prohibit gender identity discrim-\nination  in  various  contexts,  including  employment \nand education.14 Neither bill has ever left committee.  \n                                                 \n13  H.R. 4530 (111th Cong. 2010); S. 3390 (111th Cong. 2010); \nH.R. 998 (112th Cong. 2011); S. 555 (112th Cong. 2011); H.R. \n1652 (113th Cong. 2013); S. 1088 (113th Cong. 2013); H.R. 846 \n(114th Cong. 2015); S. 439 (114th Cong. 2015). \n14  S. 1858 (114th Cong. 2015); H.R. 3185 (114th Cong. 2015).  \n \n \n\n  35 \n4.  When determining the nature and limits of sex \ndiscrimination law, this Court has always focused on \nphysiological  differences,  especially  in  contexts  in-\nvolving the lawful separation of males and females. \nFor example, in Virginia, this Court determined that \nmale-only admission to the Virginia Military Institute \nviolated equal protection, but noted that the required \nco-educational  integration  “would  undoubtedly  re-\nquire alterations necessary to afford members of each \nsex  privacy  from  the  other  sex  in  living  arrange-\nments.” 518 U.S. at 550 n.19. Similarly, as Justice \nKennedy wrote for the Court in Tuan Anh Nguyen v. \nINS, a more rigorous standard for proving paternity \nas opposed to maternity did not violate equal protec-\ntion because “[f]athers and mothers are not similarly \nsituated  with  regard  to  the  proof  of  biological \nparenthood.” 533 U.S. 53, 62–63 (2001). Justice Ste-\nvens captured the essence of this point in City of Los \nAngeles, Department of Water & Power v. Manhart, \nwhen he wrote for the Court that “[t]here are both real \nand fictional differences between women and men.” \n435 U.S. 702, 707 (1978). Physiological differences be-\ntween men and women—especially when it comes to \nprivacy—are real ones. Nowhere is that more true \nthan in the educational settings of bathrooms, show-\ners, and sports teams. \nThose cases support interpreting Title IX and its \nregulations to allow the privacy-based separation of \n \n \n\n  36 \nmen and women on the basis of physiological differ-\nences.15  As  this  Court  has  observed,  “[t]o  fail  to \nacknowledge  even  our  most  basic  biological  differ-\nences … risks making the guarantee of equal protec-\ntion superficial, and so disserving it.” Nguyen, 533 \nU.S. at 73. The same commonsense principle applies \nto Title IX.  \nB. Equating  “Sex”  With  Gender  Identity \nWould Undermine Title IX’s Structure. \nIn addition to violating Title IX’s text and history, \nthe interpretation accepted by the Fourth Circuit—re-\nquiring access to sex-separated facilities based on gen-\nder identity—would undermine Title IX’s structure \nand make the statute impossible to administer. Gen-\nder identity, as G.G. explained below, means individ-\nuals’ “innate sense of being male or female,” which \nmay differ from “the sex they were assigned at birth.” \nJA64. Making access to sex-separated facilities turn \non this elusive concept would lead to obvious and in-\ntractable problems of administration. Because “[i]t is \nimplausible that Congress meant [Title IX] to operate \nin this manner,” King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, \n2494 (2015), this is yet another reason to reject the \ninterpretation accepted by the Fourth Circuit. \n                                                 \n15  Lower courts have similarly concluded that federal prohibi-\ntions on “sex” discrimination concern physiological distinctions \nbetween men and women. See, e.g., Johnston v. Univ. of Pitts-\nburgh of the Com. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 670, \n676 (W.D. Pa. 2015), appeal dismissed (Mar. 30, 2016) (collecting \ndecisions). \n \n \n\n  37 \nTo put it plainly: how is a school to determine a \nstudent’s gender identity for purposes of managing ac-\ncess  to  sex-separated  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  or \nshowers? The Fourth Circuit’s opinion does not say, \nand no standard suggested below provides any plausi-\nble answer.  \n1.  The standard suggested by G.G.’s definition of \n“gender identity”—one’s “innate sense of being male \nor female,” JA64—implies that a student’s mere as-\nsertion of his or her gender identity settles the mat-\nter.16 But if members of one physiological sex could \nobtain access to facilities reserved for the other sex \nsimply by announcing their gender identity, the sex \nseparation contemplated by Title IX and its regula-\ntions would cease to exist. A school might wish to keep \nboys and girls in separate facilities, but in practice \nany given facility would be open to members of both \nsexes. Some may use the opposite sex’s facilities to ex-\npress their gender identity, but others will do so for \nless worthy reasons. A “pure assertion” standard gives \nno way to distinguish them.  \nThat outcome would come as a shock to Title IX’s \ncongressional  advocates,  who  authorized  separate \n“living facilities” to ensure that members of different \n                                                 \n16   While the Ferg-Cadima letter does not address this issue, the \nDepartment’s Dear Colleague letter would also establish a “pure \nassertion” standard: a student must be treated according to his \nor her gender identity once “the student … notifies the school” of \nthat gender identity, and without any requirement of a “medical \ndiagnosis or treatment.” App. 130a–131a. \n \n \n\n  38 \nsexes would be separable in certain intimate settings. \nSupra at 7–10. If Title IX’s proponents had contem-\nplated that members of one sex could use the opposite \nsex’s facilities, based on their perception of having \nbeen “born in the wrong sex,” App. 151a, there would \nhave been no reason for permitting separation of sexes \nin intimate settings. See App. 57a (Niemeyer, J. dis-\nsenting). The interpretation accepted by the Fourth \nCircuit thus nullifies what the framers of Title IX and \nits  regulations  plainly  sought  to  preserve:  spaces \navailable to members of one physiological sex and off-\nlimits to the other. \n2.  Some of G.G.’s pleadings below may imply an \nalternative approach, but it fits Title IX no better. \nThis approach appears to turn on gender presentation \n(i.e., whether someone appears to be relatively more \nmasculine or feminine) and corresponding feelings of \ndiscomfort on being  required to use a facility con-\nsistent with physiological sex. In other words, because \nG.G. “presents” as a boy, JA65, 67, 73, and feels more \nat home in a boys’ restroom, JA73–74, G.G. should \nhave  access  to  boys’  restrooms.  But  that  standard \nwould create even more serious problems than the \nfirst one. It suggests that schools must evaluate access \nclaims based on how consistently or comprehensively \na student presents his or her gender identity. The De-\npartment appears to have joined that approach ini-\ntially—App. 181a (supporting preliminary injunction \nbecause G.G.’s “gender identity is male and [he] pre-\nsents as male in all aspects of his life”)—but has since \n \n \n\n  39 \ndisavowed it. See App. 57a–58a (Niemeyer, J. dissent-\ning); App. 130a.  \nThat is for good reason, because such an approach \nwould require schools to engage in sex-stereotyping \ndiscrimination. Administrators would inevitably have \nto evaluate students’ access to facilities based on rela-\ntive  masculine  or  feminine  traits—which  is  classic \nsex-stereotyping. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at \n250–51  (forbidding  adverse  actions  against  women \nunder  Title  VII  based  on  stereotypical  views  of \nwomen’s appearance or mannerisms). The only way \nout of this trap is to understand “sex” as the Board’s \npolicy does—namely, as referring to objective physio-\nlogical criteria. That standard rejects classifying stu-\ndents based on whether they meet any stereotypical \nnotion of maleness or femaleness, and in that sense is \nthe opposite of sex-stereotyping.  \n3.  Even if the problem of standards were resolved, \nother contradictions would arise. For instance, mak-\ning access turn on gender identity would perpetuate \ndiscrimination in a different form. Persons whose gen-\nder identities align with physiological sex would have \naccess only to one facility, but individuals such as G.G. \ncould opt in to the opposite sex’s facilities depending \non their gender presentation or the status of their \ntransition to the opposite sex. There would thus be dif-\nferent degrees of access depending on divergence of \ngender identity from physiology: another classic case \nof discrimination.  \n \n \n\n  40 \nThis standard would also create new legal risks for \nregulated  schools.  For  instance,  below  the  United \nStates urged denying “any recognition” to the “discom-\nfort” expressed by “parents and community members \n… to students sharing a common use restroom with \ntransgender students[.]” App. 180a. Doing so would \n“‘cater  to  …  perceived  biases[.]’”  Id.  181a  (quoting \nUnited States Dep’t of Labor, Directive: Job Corps \nProgram Instruction Notice No. 14-31 3–4 (May 1, \n2015)). As callous as that position sounds on paper, it \nalso has likely legal consequences—for example, if a \nsexual assault victim felt that the presence of the op-\nposite sex in restrooms, lockers, or showers created a \nhostile environment. See Jeannie Suk Gersen, The \nTransgender Bathroom Debate and the Looming Title \nIX Crisis, The New Yorker (May 24, 2016).  \nYet another problem arises in the context of ath-\nletics, where regulations provide a similar safe harbor \nfor sex separation. As mentioned supra, Title IX regu-\nlations prohibit discriminating on the basis of sex in \nathletic activities and require recipients to “provide \nequal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” \n34 C.F.R. §106.41(a), (c). But the regulations also pro-\nvide  for  “separate  teams  for  members  of  each  sex \nwhere selection … is based upon competitive skill or \nthe activity involved is a contact sport.” 34 C.F.R. \n§106.41(b).  That  separation  is  plainly  grounded  in \nphysiology: Even beyond privacy interests in contact \nsports, providing separate teams for female students \ncreates more opportunities for participation and pro-\ntects them from injury.  \n \n \n\n  41 \nSex separation in athletics only works, however, if \n“sex”  means  physiological  sex;  if  it  means  “gender \nidentity,” nothing prevents athletes who were born \nmale from opting onto female teams, obtaining com-\npetitive advantages and displacing girls and women. \nSee, e.g., Transgender Track Star Stirs Controversy \nCompeting in Alaska’s Girls’ State Meet Champion-\nships, CBS New York, June 8, 2016 (noting an “18-\nyear old runner … [who] was born male and identifies \nas  female”  competed  in  “Class  3A  girls’  sprints”). \nGiven the Fourth Circuit majority’s position that “‘sex’ \nshould be construed uniformly throughout Title IX \nand its implementing regulations,” App. 25a, such an \noutcome appears inevitable.  \nThese and other serious practical problems17 coun-\nsel strongly against the Fourth Circuit’s attempt to \ntransform the statutory prohibition on sex discrimina-\ntion into the distinctly different prohibition on gender \nidentity discrimination.   \nC. If  “Sex”  Were  Equated  With  “Gender \nIdentity,” Title IX And Its Regulations \nWould Be Invalid For Lack Of Clear No-\ntice. \nEven if Title IX and its regulations did not unam-\nbiguously forbid the interpretation advanced by the \n                                                 \n17   See, e.g., Brief of Amici McHugh and Mayer; Brief of Amicus \nCuriae Alliance Defending Freedom; Brief of Amicus Curiae Safe \nSpaces for Women; Brief of Amici Religious Colleges, Schools, \nand Educators; Brief of Amici Major Religious Organizations. \n \n \n\n  42 \nDepartment and accepted by the Fourth Circuit, they \ncertainly did not foreshadow it. Again, as G.G. admits, \nthat interpretation was unimaginable at the time Ti-\ntle IX and its regulations were first adopted. Opp. 1. \nIf that is true—and it is—the Fourth Circuit’s holding \nwould make Title IX violate the Spending Clause for \nfailure to afford funding recipients clear notice of the \nconditions of funding.  \nTitle IX was enacted under the Spending Clause, \nand the threat of withdrawing federal funding is the \nmain enforcement mechanism. See 20 U.S.C. §1682. \n“Legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power \nis much in the nature of a contract, and therefore, to \nbe bound by federally imposed conditions, recipients \nof federal funds must accept them voluntarily and \nknowingly.” Murphy, 548 U.S. at 296 (quotes and al-\nteration omitted) (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). \nFor that reason, “when Congress attaches conditions \nto a State’s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions \nmust be set out unambiguously,” for “States cannot \nknowingly accept conditions of which they are una-\nware  or  which  they  are  unable  to  ascertain.”  Id. \n(quotes and citation omitted).  \nFor over four decades, States have accepted Title \nIX funding with the understanding that they could \nmaintain  separate  facilities  based  on  men  and \nwomen’s different physiologies; nothing in the text of \nTitle IX or its implementing regulations “even hint[s]” \nthat they would ever have to do anything else. Id. at \n297. If the Fourth Circuit’s position is plausible, then \n \n \n\n  43 \nit sets the stage for a funding condition that States \nnever  could  have  anticipated.  See  Brief  of  Amici \nStates of West Virginia et al. \nThat position must be rejected under the rule of \nconstitutional avoidance. See, e.g., Edward J. DeBar-\ntolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades \nCouncil, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (“[W]here an other-\nwise  acceptable  construction of  a  statute  would \nraise serious  constitutional  problems,  the  Court \nwill construe the statute to avoid such problems un-\nless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent \nof Congress.”). That rule supports interpreting Title \nIX in a way that does not permit the Fourth Circuit—\nor  the  Department—to  “surpris[e]  participating \nStates with post-acceptance or retroactive conditions.” \nNFIB v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2606 (2012) (quot-\ning Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25). This is yet another rea-\nson  to  reject  the  interpretation  embraced  by  the \nFourth Circuit.  \nII. The  Fourth  Circuit  Erred  In  Extending \nAuer Deference To The Ferg-Cadima Let-\nter. \nAlternatively, this Court can reverse the Fourth \nCircuit on the ground that the panel erred in extend-\ning Auer deference to the interpretation in the Ferg-\nCadima letter.  \n \n \n\n  44 \nA. Auer  Deference  Is  Inapplicable  Be-\ncause  The  Ferg-Cadima  Letter  Inter-\nprets  Title  IX,  Rather  Than  Depart-\nment Regulations. \nThe simplest reason why Auer deference should \nnot extend to the Ferg-Cadima letter is that the letter \ndoes not interpret the Department’s Title IX regula-\ntions. Instead, the letter interprets the term “sex” in \nTitle IX itself. That distinction is critical to the letter’s \nlegal effect, for this Court has held that Auer defer-\nence is inappropriate where an agency’s view “cannot \nbe considered an interpretation of the regulation” as \nopposed to the underlying statute. See Gonzales, 546 \nU.S. at 247. \n1. Identifying the interpretive object of the Ferg-\nCadima letter begins with reading the letter on its \nown terms. When the letter states its key conclusion—\nthat “sex” includes “gender identity”—it says it is in-\nterpreting Title IX, not a regulation: “Title IX … pro-\nhibits recipients of Federal financial assistance from \ndiscriminating on the basis of sex, including gender \nidentity.” App. 121a. That language can only mean \nthat  Title  IX  itself—at  least  in  the  Department’s \nview—incorporates a prohibition on gender identity \ndiscrimination.  \nThe rest of the letter points in the same direction. \nIt opens by referring to guidance documents concern-\ning “application of Title IX … to gender identity dis-\ncrimination.” App. 121a (emphasis added). The Q&A \nsheet the letter cites as precedent also interpreted the \n \n \n\n  45 \nstatute: it posed the hypothetical question, “How do \nthe Title IX requirements on single-sex classes apply \nto transgender students?” It answered that “[u]nder \nTitle IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender \nstudents consistent with their gender identity[.]” App. \n16a (quoting Q&A #31) (emphasis added). This rea-\nsoning is plainly driven by an interpretation of Title \nIX itself and not the Department’s regulations, which \nmeans that the basic premise for applying Auer is ab-\nsent.  \nTo be sure, the Ferg-Cadima letter notes that De-\npartment “regulations” permit certain sex-separated \nfacilities. App. 123a. But nothing suggests that the \nDepartment’s  position—that  schools  “must  treat \ntransgender  students  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity”—turns on an interpretation of that regula-\ntory language. Id. at 123a. To the contrary, the letter \nrefers to the regulation merely to note the situations \nin which recipients may “treat students differently on \nthe basis of sex,” and then peremptorily states that in \nthose situations schools must treat transgender stu-\ndents according to “gender identity.” Id. Every indica-\ntion, then, is that the Department’s position turns on \nthe letter’s major premise that “Title IX” prohibits dis-\ncrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex,  including  gender \nidentity.” App. 121a. \nLimiting Auer deference to interpretations of reg-\nulations rather than statutes follows from the justifi-\ncations  this  Court  has  provided  for  Auer—namely, \n \n \n\n  46 \nagencies’ “historical familiarity and policymaking ex-\npertise” with regulatory regimes under their supervi-\nsion and their supposed insight into the regulations \nthey promulgated. See Martin v. Occupational Safety \n& Health Review Comm’n, 499 U.S. 144, 153 (1991); \nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 \n(1994). Whatever force those justifications may have \nas to regulations, they have none when an agency in-\nterprets Congress’s words. Just so here: the Depart-\nment was interpreting the statutory term “sex,” and \nits interpretation is therefore not entitled to Auer def-\nerence.  \n2. Even assuming arguendo that the Ferg-Cadima \nletter interpreted the regulatory language rather than \nTitle IX, Auer does not apply when—as here—the reg-\nulation only “restate[s] the terms of the statute itself.” \nGonzales, 546 U.S. at 257. The point of Auer, as Gon-\nzales explained, is that agencies have authority to in-\nterpret  their  own  words,  at  least  in  some  circum-\nstances. But “[a]n agency does not acquire special au-\nthority to interpret its own words when, instead of us-\ning its expertise and experience to formulate a regu-\nlation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statu-\ntory language.” Id.  \nThe Gonzales exception to Auer applies not only \nwhen an agency imports entire statutory provisions \ninto the Code of Federal Regulations verbatim, but \nalso when a regulation’s key terms of art derive from \nthe statute. In Gonzales, the regulation “repeat[ed] \n \n \n\n  47 \ntwo statutory phrases”—specifically, “legitimate med-\nical  purpose”  and  “the  course  of  professional  prac-\ntice”—“and attempt[ed] to summarize” others. Id. Be-\ncause nothing “turn[ed] on any difference between the \nstatutory and regulatory language,” the Court held \nthat “the existence of a parroting regulation does not \nchange the fact that the question here is not the mean-\ning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.” \nId.; see also Kentucky Retirement System v. EEOC, \n554 U.S. 135, 149 (2008) (“KRS”) (applying Gonzales \nwhen agency paraphrased statutory language without \nclarifying its substance); Fed. Exp. Corp. v. Holowecki, \n552 U.S. 389, 398 (2008) (noting Auer may not apply \nto interpretation of regulatory term “change” because \n“[i]t is a term Congress used in the underlying statute \nthat has been incorporated in the regulations by the \nagency”).18  \nThat reasoning forecloses Auer deference here, for \nas in Gonzales, the Department’s regulations merely \n“parrot” the relevant statutory term. Title IX provides \nthat  its  anti-discrimination  rule  shall  not  be  “con-\nstrued to prohibit any educational institution receiv-\ning funds under this Act, from maintaining separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. §1686 \n                                                 \n18  Lower courts have applied Gonzales in the same way. See \nFogo De Chao (Holdings) Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 769 F.3d 1127, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Sun Capital Partners \nIII, LP v. New England Teamsters & Trucking Indus. Pension \nFund, 724 F.3d 129, 139–41 (1st Cir. 2013); In re Kaiser Alumi-\nnum Corp., 456 F.3d 328, 345–46 & n.12 (3d Cir. 2006).  \n \n \n\n  48 \n(emphasis added). The Department’s regulations ad-\ndress that exemption by providing that a funding re-\ncipient “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities \nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to \nsuch facilities provided for students of the other sex.” \n34 C.F.R. §106.33 (emphasis added).  \nIn the regulation, HEW applied its interpretive au-\nthority and expertise not to elaborate on the definition \nof “sex,” but to flesh out the statute’s reference to “liv-\ning facilities.” Implementing Title IX, supra, at 826; \nApp. 98a. The regulation builds on the statute by de-\nscribing which facilities count and by adding the pro-\nviso that when separate facilities are established, they \nmust be “comparable.” But this litigation does not \nturn on any of that. Instead, it turns on the meaning \nof “sex”—a term Congress used in the statute and \nwhich the regulations reuse without elaboration. The \nDepartment cannot claim that its interpretation of \nthat term “turns on any difference between the statu-\ntory and regulatory language.” Gonzales, 546 U.S. at \n257. To the contrary, the term “sex” “comes from Con-\ngress, not the [agency],” and the agency has no “spe-\ncial authority” to interpret it. Id.   \nThis Court’s decision in KRS confirms this conclu-\nsion. See 554 U.S. 135. That case involved the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), which \nforbids discriminating against workers “because of ... \nage.” 29 U.S.C. §623(a)(1). As in this case, an agency \n \n \n\n  49 \nhad promulgated a regulation setting out what a reg-\nulated party could do: specifically, that giving “‘the \nsame level of benefits to older workers as to younger \nworkers’ does not violate the [ADEA].” See KRS, 554 \nU.S. at 149 (quoting 29 C.F.R. §1625.10(a)(2)) (empha-\nsis omitted). And as here, the agency interpreted the \nregulation’s key criterion (age differences) to include \nother unenumerated factors (factors correlated with \nage, such as receipt of pension benefits). Id. But this \nCourt refused to defer to that interpretation, reason-\ning that “the regulation ‘does little more than restate \nthe terms of the statute itself.’” Id. (quoting Gonzales, \n546 U.S. at 257). This case is even easier than KRS, \nbecause the regulatory language there was further re-\nmoved  from  the  statutory  language  than  section \n106.33 is from Title IX.  \nOf course, the Department could attempt to invoke \nits  interpretive  authority  as  to  the  statutory  term \n“sex,” in which case it could argue that whatever in-\nterpretation it reaches is entitled to Chevron defer-\nence. As discussed below, the Department has never \ndone so. See Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 258. And as dis-\ncussed above, the statutory text forecloses its inter-\npretation. Supra at 26–32.  \nB. Auer  Deference  Is  Inapplicable  Be-\ncause The Governing Regulation, Like \nTitle IX, Is Unambiguous. \nAssuming that Auer could extend to the Depart-\nment’s interpretation of “sex,” Auer applies only when \nregulatory language is ambiguous. See Christensen, \n \n \n\n  50 \n529 U.S. at 588. When the regulation is unambiguous, \nAuer does not aid the agency; courts instead apply the \nregulation as written. Id. Any other rule “would … \npermit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a \nregulation, to create de facto a new regulation.” Id. \nWith respect to the term “sex,” the regulation is not \nambiguous, however, and certainly not in the way im-\nplied by the Ferg-Cadima letter.  \n1. As this Court has held, “ambiguity” in the con-\ntext of interpreting statutes and regulations means \nmore than room for semantic disagreement: “[a]mbi-\nguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but \nof statutory context[.]” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n115, 118 (1994); see also also MCI Telecomms, 512 \nU.S. at 226 (explaining courts should not merely “de-\nfer to the agency’s choice among available dictionary \ndefinitions”). An analogy to identifying ambiguity un-\nder Chevron is illustrative: under Chevron, a court can \ndetermine a statute is ambiguous “only when the de-\nvices  of  judicial  construction  have  been  tried  and \nfound to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.” \nSee Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. \n581, 600 (2004); Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9. Those \ntools include canons of construction, Nat’l Credit Un-\nion Admin., 522 U.S. at 501, awareness of how statu-\ntory structures work as a whole, Food & Drug Admin. \nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n133 (2000), and “common sense,” id. at 133.  \n \n \n\n  51 \nHere, the standard tools of statutory construction \nshow that the term “sex” in the Department’s regula-\ntions does not extend to gender  identity—and cer-\ntainly does not permit gender identity to determine a \nperson’s sex. 34 C.F.R. §106.33. As explained above, \nCongress understood the term “sex” in Title IX to refer \nto  the  physiological  differences  between  men  and \nwomen, and the same considerations apply with equal \nforce to the term as it appears in the regulations prom-\nulgated by HEW. The practical concerns that would \narise if “sex” meant something other than physiology \nare essentially identical. Just as with the interpreta-\ntion of Title IX, these considerations show that “sex” \nin the Department regulations unambiguously refers \nto physiology.19  \n2. The Department’s decision to introduce gender \nidentity into the regulatory scheme in the teeth of this \nhistory raises two related concerns. First, agency acts \nare arbitrary and capricious when an agency “relie[s] \non factors which Congress has not intended it to con-\nsider[.]” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). That \n                                                 \n19   As already discussed, the Fourth Circuit found ambiguity in \nthe term “sex” by misreading two 1970s-era dictionaries. App. \n21a–22a; supra at 26–32. But even assuming those sources \nshowed “sex” could have various shades of meaning, they do not \nshow the ambiguity the Fourth Circuit discerned: i.e., as applied \nto persons whose perceived gender “diverge[s]” from their physi-\nological sex. App. 21a–23a. None of those definitions suggests \nthat a person’s perception of being male or female is a component \nof “sex.” See supra at 26–32 (discussing definitions). \n \n \n\n  52 \nis, insofar as “sex” is ambiguous, the Department can \nonly clarify it with reference to the factors that Con-\ngress authorized. See Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. \n2699, 2706–07 (2015) (citing, inter alia, Motor Vehicle \nMfrs., 463 U.S. at 43). That includes the factors Con-\ngress would have thought relevant to the definition of \nsex —i.e., “the sum of those anatomical and physiolog-\nical differences with reference to which the male and \nfemale are distinguished,” App. 21a (quoting Ameri-\ncan College Dictionary 1109)—but not a factor like \ngender identity, which no one would have thought in-\ncluded in the term “sex,” much less determinative of \nits meaning.  \nSecond, even when resolving ambiguities, “agen-\ncies must operate within the bounds of reasonable in-\nterpretation.” UARG v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2442 \n(2014) (quotes omitted). A term “that may seem am-\nbiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder \nof the statutory scheme because only one of the per-\nmissible meanings produces a substantive effect that \nis compatible with the rest of the law.” Id. (quotes and \nalteration omitted). Likewise, “an agency interpreta-\ntion that is inconsistent with the design and structure \nof the statute as a whole does not merit deference.” Id. \n(quotes, citation, and alteration omitted). Those prin-\nciples foreclose the approach the Ferg-Cadima letter \ntakes. The letter purports to resolve a putative ambi-\nguity of “sex” as related to gender identity that ends \nup undermining Congress’s purposes and sets up po-\ntentially intractable problems of administration. Su-\npra at 32–44. In short, what the Department cannot \n \n \n\n  53 \ndo under the guise of resolving “ambiguities” is intro-\nduce extraneous factors that would render a forty-\nyear-old anti-discrimination rule “unrecognizable to \nthe Congress that designed it.” Id. at 2444 (quotes \nomitted).  \n3. At a minimum, Auer deference can extend only \nto interpretations that would have been foreseeable at \nthe time the regulation was promulgated. Extending \nAuer to unforeseeable interpretations would offend \nthe requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act \nthat members of the public have the opportunity to \ncomment on regulations affecting them, see Mission \nGroup Kansas, Inc. v. Riley, 146 F.3d 775, 782 (10th \nCir. 1998), and potentially the fair notice requirement \nof federal due process, see Upton v. SEC, 75 F.3d 92, \n98 (2d Cir. 1996); Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 53 F.3d 1324, \n1329 (D.C. Cir. 1995). This Court has already declined \nto  apply  Auer  in  an  analogous  context,  where  an \nagency first announced its position in amicus briefs \nfiled after “a very lengthy period of conspicuous inac-\ntion[.]” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 132 \nS. Ct. 2156, 2168 (2012).  \nThe notion that Title IX’s anti-discrimination rule \nrequires that members of different physiological sexes \nbe allowed to share restrooms, lockers, and showers \nwould have been inconceivable until the Ferg-Cadima \nletter was issued. Not only did that letter cite no prec-\nedent relevant to restroom, locker, and shower facili-\nties, supra at 14–15, but the Fourth Circuit itself con-\nceded that the “interpretation is novel because there \n \n \n\n  54 \nwas no interpretation as to how §106.33 applied to \ntransgender individuals before January 2015[.]” App. \n23a (emphasis added). Doubtless members of the pub-\nlic would have wanted to comment on this “novel” \nquestion. Mission Group Kansas, 146 F.3d at 782. The \nregulations should be interpreted to avoid springing \nsuch a surprise on affected parties.  \nC. Auer  Deference  Is  Inapplicable  Be-\ncause The Department Failed To Fol-\nlow The Necessary Formal Procedures.  \nFinally, the Ferg-Cadima letter does not merit def-\nerence because the Department ignored the formal \nprocedures required to act with the force of law. The \nFourth Circuit held, in essence, that an agency can \n“control[  ]”  a  court’s  interpretation  of  a  regulation \nmerely by issuing an informal opinion letter signed by \nan intermediate agency official. App. 25a. Whatever \nAuer’s proper scope should be, it should not extend so \nfar. \n1.  The Ferg-Cadima letter does not carry \nthe force of law under Mead and Chris-\ntensen.  \nExtending Auer to an informal document like the \nFerg-Cadima letter creates conflict between Auer and \nthe related doctrine of deference to agency statutory \ninterpretations  embodied  in  Chevron.  As  several \ncourts of appeals have held, Auer doctrine should be \ntailored to avoid that tension.  \n \n \n\n  55 \n1. This Court’s decisions in United States v. Mead \nCorp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001), and Christensen v. Harris \nCounty, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), establish the scope and \ntheoretical foundations of the modern Chevron doc-\ntrine. Mead holds that deference to agency interpreta-\ntions of statutes rests on the assumption that Con-\ngress sometimes implicitly delegates to agencies the \nauthority to create law by filling the gaps in statutes. \n533 U.S. at 226–27, 229. For an agency act to carry \nthe force of law, the agency has to act within the scope \nof that delegation, i.e., there must have been a sub-\nstantive delegation of lawmaking power to the agency \nfrom Congress, and the agency must have exercised \nthat delegation through the procedural channels Con-\ngress created. Id.  \nOnly acts carrying the force of law are entitled to \nChevron deference. Id.; see also id. at 243 (Scalia, J., \ndissenting). For example, as indicated in Christensen, \neven where an agency has authority to act with the \nforce of law, it typically needs to employ formal proce-\ndures such as “formal adjudication or notice-and-com-\nment rulemaking”—or at least close equivalents—to \nensure  that  a  particular  act  compels  deference  in \ncourt. See 529 U.S. at 587. When an agency act does \nnot carry the force of law, it does not bind a court, but \ninstead  carries  weight  proportionate  only  to  its \n“‘power to persuade.’” Mead, 533 U.S. at 234–35 (quot-\ning Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944)).  \nThe Mead/Christensen rule resolves a legal puzzle. \nUnder the APA, an agency must follow formal, public \n \n \n\n  56 \nprocedures when it creates law—as opposed to engag-\ning in informal adjudications or issuing nonbinding \nguidelines  or  interpretations.  See  5  U.S.C. \n§552(a)(1)(D) (requiring that “interpretations of gen-\neral applicability” be published in the Federal Regis-\nter); id. §553(b) (providing procedures for notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking). Lower federal courts have of-\nten worked to prevent agencies from circumventing \nprocedural requirements by issuing purportedly non-\nbinding guidance documents. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. \nEPA,  290  F.3d  377  (D.C.  Cir.  2002);  Appalachian \nPower Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015 (D.C. Cir. 2000); \nChamber of Commerce v. Dep’t of Labor, 174 F.3d 206 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999). Yet without Mead and Christensen, \nsuch informal documents would have binding legal \nforce in the sense that they bind courts. This Court’s \nMead/Christensen rule thus prevents agencies from \ncreating  law  without  observing  mandatory  proce-\ndures.  \n2. Under the Fourth Circuit’s approach, however, \nthe puzzle that Mead and Christensen resolved for \nChevron purposes persists under Auer, where agen-\ncies interpret their own regulations. This Court held \nin  Christensen  that  an  informal  “opinion  letter”—\nmuch like the Ferg-Cadima letter—“lack[s] the force \nof law” and so “do[es] not warrant Chevron-style def-\nerence” when it purports to interpret a statute. 529 \nU.S. at 587. Yet because the majority in this case \nthought the Ferg-Cadima letter interpreted Depart-\nment regulations, it gave the letter “controlling” def-\nerence  under  Auer.  That  creates  a  paradox  under \n \n \n\n  57 \nwhich agency actions that do not carry the force of law \nnonetheless bind courts—and thereby end up carrying \nthe force of law at least as to the parties.  \nIt is difficult to square that paradox with any plau-\nsible account of congressional intent. Only Congress \ncould have delegated the Department the ability to \nauthoritatively fill gaps in its own regulations by in-\nformal means. See La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 \nU.S. 355, 374–75 (1986) (explaining that agencies can-\nnot create new powers for themselves). But Title IX \nand the APA give no reason to conclude that Congress \nintended to allow the Department to do so. Even if \nCongress’s delegation of lawmaking power to agencies \ndoes  implicitly  entail  an  authoritative  gap-filling \npower applicable to regulations, it is “odd” to think \nthat Congress would delegate that power to informal \nacts by mid-level officers like Mr. Ferg-Cadima. See \nKeys v. Barnhart, 347 F.3d 990, 994 (7th Cir. 2003) \n(Posner, J.).  \nThe principal justifications for Auer deference do \nnot require courts to defer to informal agency inter-\npretations.  This  Court  has  customarily  explained \nAuer in terms of agencies’ “historical familiarity and \npolicymaking expertise” with regulatory regimes un-\nder their supervision. See Martin, 499 U.S. at 153; \nThomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.S. at 512. But while \nexpertise-based factors justify the persuasive weight \ngiven  to  agency  interpretations  of  statutes  under \nSkidmore, see Mead, 533 U.S. at 228, they do not jus-\n \n \n\n  58 \ntify  Chevron  deference,  which  requires  a  congres-\nsional delegation, see id. at 229. The rationales under-\nlying  Auer,  in  other  words,  justify  giving  informal \nagency interpretations of regulations due weight, but \nnot letting them control in court. See also Brief of \nAmici Cato Institute, Michael W. McConnell, Richard \nA. Epstein et al. \n3.  Applying Auer deference to the Ferg-Cadima \nletter would also be inconsistent with doctrines gov-\nerning  the  reviewability  of  agency  actions.  Final \nagency acts with binding legal effect are typically sub-\nject to immediate judicial review under the APA by \nparties with standing to challenge them. See Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (setting out \nstandards  for  APA  reviewability).  But  courts  have \nconsistently ruled that informal opinion letters and \nguidance documents are not immediately reviewable, \nreasoning that they do not carry binding legal effect. \nSee, e.g., Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 F.3d \n420, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2004). If opinion letters carry only \npersuasive weight, that rule makes sense. But the \nFourth Circuit’s application of Auer deference implies \nthat countless opinion letters bearing on agency regu-\nlations do have legal effect; they revise the meaning of \nambiguous regulations, “controlling” judicial resolu-\ntion of cases and binding private parties. App. 25a. \nThe  implication  is  that  agencies  are  creating  law \nevery day without risk of being held to immediate ac-\ncount in court, a circumstance this Court has repeat-\nedly sought to avoid. See United States Army Corps of \n \n \n\n  59 \nEng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807 (2016); Sackett \nv. EPA, 132 S. Ct. 1367 (2012). \n4.  The  most  plausible  solution  that  preserves \nAuer is to maintain the symmetry and consistency of \nthe Chevron and Auer deference doctrines. If the De-\npartment wants documents like the Ferg-Cadima let-\nter to have controlling effect in court, it should follow \nprocedures sufficient to give them the force of law. If \nthe Department does not want to follow those proce-\ndures, it should not expect its positions to merit con-\ntrolling deference. See Matthew C. Stephenson & Miri \nPogoriler, Seminole Rock’s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash. L. \nRev. 1449, 1464 (2011). \nSome circuit courts have already indicated that \nChevron-like formality considerations should apply in \ncases governed by Auer.20 And this Court has implied \nthe same thing. In Central Laborers’ Pension Fund v. \nHeinz, the Court addressed an IRS regulation where \ntwo agency interpretations were contrary to the regu-\nlation’s  plain  meaning:  a  provision  of  the  Internal \nRevenue Manual, and the United States’ amicus brief \nbefore the Court. 541 U.S. 739, 748 (2004). The Court \nrejected  reliance  on  both:  “neither  an  unreasoned \nstatement in the manual nor allegedly longstanding \nagency practice can trump a formal regulation with \nthe procedural history necessary to take on the force \n                                                 \n20   See Pet. 26–28 (collecting decisions). However, as noted in \nthe petition, there is a circuit split on this issue. See id. at 29 \n(collecting contrary decisions). \n \n \n\n  60 \nof law.” Id. Although the Court did not mention Auer, \nthe import of the Court’s language is that informal \nagency positions, because they lack the force of law, \ncannot command the kind of deference that makes \nthem binding on courts. The principle alone requires \nreversal of the Fourth Circuit’s decision here.  \n5.  Deference to informal agency interpretations is \nparticularly inappropriate where, as here, the inter-\npretation is issued for the first time in an effort to af-\nfect the outcome of a specific judicial proceeding. See \nPet.  26–27.  For  example,  in  Vietnam  Veterans  of \nAmerica v. CIA, 811 F.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2015), the \nNinth Circuit refused to apply Auer deference to an \ninterpretation of agency rules that was “‘developed … \nonly in the context of this litigation.’” Id. at 1078. And \nin Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. United \nStates, 782 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2015), the Federal \nCircuit refused to apply the Auer framework to an IRS \ninterpretation that was “advanced for the first time in \nlitigation.” Id. at 1369–70. Both of these decisions cor-\nrectly recognize that deferring to an informal agency \ninterpretation that is developed solely to influence the \njudicial proceeding in which deference is sought cre-\nates enormous incentives for gamesmanship. Accord-\ning Auer deference in such circumstances also denies \nthe public—or other affected parties—any effective \nability  to  ensure  that  their  views  are  adequately \nheard and considered before the agency acts. This too \nis a sufficient basis for reversing the Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision to invoke Auer deference.  \n \n \n\n  61 \n6.  Even under this modest approach to Auer def-\nerence, that doctrine would still retain vitality in cer-\ntain  circumstances.  For  example,  Auer  deference \nmight apply when agencies resolve legal issues in the \ncourse of formal agency adjudications, or when they \nissue  official  guidance  after  notice  and  comment. \nHowever, it no longer makes sense for Auer to extend \nto ad hoc, informal agency acts such as the Ferg-Ca-\ndima letter—especially when such acts are taken in \nthe context of the very proceeding in which deference \nis sought.  \n2.  The Ferg-Cadima letter issued without \nobservance  of  procedures  required  by \nTitle IX.  \nEven if Auer deference remains theoretically appli-\ncable to agency actions that would not deserve defer-\nence under Chevron, it at least should not apply to \nagency actions taken in excess of the lawmaking pow-\ners Congress has delegated.  \nCongress  enumerated  in  Title  IX  the  circum-\nstances under which the Department can bind regu-\nlated entities with the force of law. See 20 U.S.C. \n§1682. The Department can initiate formal adminis-\ntrative adjudications to enforce Title IX by terminat-\ning federal funding. Id. DOE may also “effectuate” Ti-\ntle IX’s anti-discrimination policy by issuing “rules, \nregulations, or orders of general applicability[.]” Id. To \nissue such rules, regulations, and orders, the Depart-\nment must follow statutory procedures beyond those \nprescribed  by  the  APA.  Specifically,  section  1682 \n \n \n\n  62 \nstates that “[n]o such rule, regulation, or order shall \nbecome  effective  unless  and  until  approved  by  the \nPresident.” Id. In addition, Congress has imposed cer-\ntain  requirements  when  the  Department  issues  a \n“regulation,”  defined  as  “any  generally  applicable \nrule, regulation, guideline, interpretation, or other re-\nquirement that—(1) is prescribed by the Secretary or \nthe Department; and (2) has legally binding effect in \nconnection with, or affecting, the provision of financial \nassistance under any applicable program.” 20 U.S.C. \n§1232(a).  Such  regulations  must,  for  example,  be \ntransmitted to the Speaker of the House of Represent-\natives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n“[c]oncurrently” with their publication. Id. §1232(f).  \nIf the Department intended the Ferg-Cadima let-\nter to have binding legal effect, it breached its proce-\ndural obligations. No formal adjudication has taken \nplace, so if the letter had legally binding effect it must \nbe  a  “regulation”  within  the  meaning  of  section \n1232(a). But nothing in the record indicates that the \nFerg-Cadima letter was directly approved by the Pres-\nident, id. §1682, or transmitted to the leaders of Con-\ngress, id. §1232(f). As noted above, the Department \ndid not follow the publication, notice, and public com-\nment procedures necessary for binding “rules,” “regu-\nlations,” or “interpretations of general applicability” \nunder the APA. See 5 U.S.C. §§552, 553  \nThe Department cannot claim binding legal effect \nfor agency acts while failing to observe procedural re-\n \n \n\n  63 \nquirements imposed by Congress. In the Chevron con-\ntext, this Court has made clear that “deference is not \nwarranted where the regulation is ‘procedurally defec-\ntive’—that is, where the agency errs by failing to fol-\nlow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.” \nSee Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. \n2117, 2125 (2016). Moreover, Congress’s provision of \nparticular means for an agency to act with the force of \nlaw implies that the agency lacks the force of law \nwhen it acts in other ways. See Mead, 533 U.S. at 231–\n32; Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 260.  \nTo be sure, the Department can avoid many of Ti-\ntle IX’s procedural obligations by issuing nonbinding \ndocuments. For example, the Department does not \nneed presidential approval when issuing nonbinding \n“interpretive guidelines.” See Equity in Athletics, Inc. \nv. Dep’t of Educ., 639 F.3d 91, 106 (4th Cir. 2011). But \nin the Chevron context, the Department would sacri-\nfice judicial deference by doing so. Applying Auer def-\nerence in circumstances like these would once again \ngo beyond Chevron by allowing the Department to \nbind private parties without following procedural pre-\nrequisites.  \nThat, in essence, would make the agency a law \nunto itself, thereby raising all the concerns that have \nled several members of this Court to consider overrul-\ning Auer altogether. See Pet. 18–20. If Auer is to re-\nmain in force, it should be applied in a way that re-\nspects the boundaries Congress has set.  \n \n \n\n  64 \nCONCLUSION \nThe decisions below should be reversed and the \npreliminary injunction vacated. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN F.

Forreasonsset forthherein,theMotion isDENIED.\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nWhen ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, courts accept a\ncomplaint's well-pled factual allegations astrue,anddrawanyreasonable inferences infavor of\nthe plaintiff. See Wag More Dogs, LLC v. Cozart, 680 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir. 2012).\nAccordingly, the Court reviews the facts as alleged by Plaintiff Gavin Grimm (\"Plaintiff or\n\"Mr. Grimm\"). See Am. Compl., ECF No. 113.\nMr. Grimmis an eighteen-year-old man who attendedGloucesterHigh School,a public\nschool in Gloucester County, Virginia, from September 2013 through his graduation in June\n2017. M 1,79. When Mr. Grimm was bom, hospital staffidentified him as female. Id, H17.\nHowever, Mr. Grimm has known from a young age that he has a male gender identity—^that is,\nhehasa\"deeplyfelt,inherentsenseofbeingaboy,aman,ormale,\" ratherthan asenseofbeing\n1\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 2 of 31 PageID# 1524\n\"a girl, a woman, or a female.\" Id, 18. Because his gender identity differs from the sex\nassigned to him at birth, he is transgender. Id. 17-19.\nLike many of his transgender peers, after the onset of puberty, Mr. Grimm began\nsufferingfrom\"debilitating levelsof distress\"as theresultof genderdysphoria, \"a conditionin\nwhich transgender individuals experience persistent and clinically significant distress caused by\nthe incongruencebetween their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth.\" Id. ^ 19.\nThere is amedical and scientific consensus that treatment for gender dysphoria includes allowing\ntransgender individuals to live in accordance with their gender identity, including \"use ofnames\nand pronouns consistent with their identity, grooming and dressing in a manner typically\nassociated with that gender, and using restrooms and other sex-separated facilities that match\ntheir gender identity.\"' Id. 20-21. Furthermore, when medically appropriate, treatment also\nincludeshormone therapy and surgery sothat transgender individuals \"may develop physical sex\ncharacteristics typical of their gender identity.\"^ Id. fl 20, 25. In addition, under widely\naccepted standards ofcare, \"boys who are transgender may undergo medically necessary chest-\nreconstruction surgeryafterthey turn [sixteen years old].\" Id. Tj 27.\nIn 2014, by the end ofhis freshman year ofhigh school, Mr. Grimm experienced such\ndistressfromhis untreated gender dysphoria that he was unable to attend class. Id. H36. At this\n' The consensus within medical and mental health communities is that excluding transgender\nindividuals from using restrooms consistent with their gender identity \"is harmftil to their health and\nwellbeing. When excluded from the common restrooms, transgender [individuals] often avoid using the\nrestroom entirely, either because the separate restrooms are too stigmatizing or too difficult to access.\"\nId. ^28. Asaresult, theysuffer fromphysicalconsequences,andtheirriskofdepression andself-harmis\nincreased.

Id. He began treatment with a\npsychologistexperienced in counseling transgender youth and, as part ofthe medically-necessary\ntreatment for his gender dysphoria, commenced the process oftransitioning to live in accordance\nwith his male identity. Id. 1, 36-37. By the time he began his sophomore year, Mr. Grimm\nhad legally changed his first name to Gavin and had begun using male pronouns. He wore\nclothing and a hairstyle in a manner consistent with other males, and used men's restrooms in\npublic venues without incident. Id. 2, 38. He also obtained a treatment documentation letter\nfromhis medical providers confirming that he was receiving treatment for gender dysphoria and\nwas to betreated as amale in all respects—includingrestroom use. Id. 2.\nInAugust2014, prior to thebeginningofhis sophomoreyear,Mr. Grimm andhis mother\nmet with the Gloucester High School Principal and the Guidance Counselor, explaining that Mr.\nGrimm isa transgender boy and would be attending school as a boy. Mr. Grimm andhis mother\nalso providedthe Principal and Counselor with the treatment documentation letter. Id. ^ 39. At\nthe time of the meeting, the Board lacked a policy addressing the restrooms that transgender\nstudents would use. Id. ^ 41. Mr. Grimm initially requested the use of the restroom in the\nnurse's office. However, that restroom was located remotely, and using it left Mr. Grimm\nfeeling stigmatized and isolated. That restroom was also far from many of his classrooms,\ncausing Mr. Grimm to be late for class when he used it. After a few weeks, Mr. Grimm sought\npermission to use the boys' restrooms. With the Principal's support, he began using the boys'\nrestrooms on October20, 2014, and did so without incident for approximately sevenweeks.^ Id.\n1142-47.\n^ He also requested permission to complete his physical education requirements through a\nhomeboundprogram, bypassingany needto use the lockerrooms atthe school. Id. ^45.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 4 of 31 PageID# 1526\nThe Principal and Superintendent informed the Board that they had authorized Mr.\nGrimm to use the boys' restrooms, but otherwise kept the matter confidential. Id. H 47.\nHowever, several adults in the community learned of a transgender student's use of the boys'\nrestrooms. Theycontacted the Board, demanding that the transgender student be barred from the\nboys' restrooms. Id. The Board considered the matter in a private meeting and took no action\nfor several weeks. However, one Board member proposed a policy regarding the use of\nrestrooms by transgender students and submitted the policy for public debate at a Board meeting\nscheduled for November 11, 2014. In pertinent part, the policy proposed that \"[i]t shall be the\npractice of the [Gloucester County Public Schools (\"GCPS\")] to provide male and female\nrestroom and lockerroom facilities in its schools, and the use ofsaid facilities shall be limited to\nthe correspondingbiological genders,and studentswithgenderidentity issues shallbe provided\nan alternative appropriate private facility.\"\"^ Id.^5\\.\nAt the meeting, Mr. Grimm decided to address the issue publicly, describing how he\nsoughtto use the restrooms\"in peace\" and had experienced \"no problemsfromstudents\"when\nusing the boys' restrooms, \"only from adults.\" Id. H55. The School Board deferreda vote on\nthe proposedpolicy until its December 9, 2014 meeting. Id. ^ 56. Before the next meeting,the\nTheentirety ofthe policy stated:\nWhereastheGCPSrecognizesthatsomestudentsquestiontheirgenderidentities,and\nWhereasthe GCPS encourages such students to seeksupport, advice, and guidance from\nparents,professionalsand othertrustedadults, and\nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to\nprotectthe privacyofall students, therefore\nItshallbe thepractice oftheGCPStoprovide maleandfemalerestroomandlockerroom\nfacilities in its schools, and the use ofsaid facilities shall be limited to the corresponding\nbiological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an\nalternativeappropriate privatefacility.\nId.^5\\.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 5 of 31 PageID# 1527\nBoardannounced plans to add or expandpartitionsbetweenurinals in the male restrooms, add\nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and to designate single-stall, unisex\nrestrooms\"to give allstudents the option foreven greaterprivacy/' Id. f 57.\nDespite the announced plans, speakers at the December 9, 2014 meeting continued to\ndemandthatMr.Grimmbeexcludedfromusingtheboys' restrooms immediately.

When he attended school football games, no restroom was available\nfor Mr. Grimm's use. As a result, Mr. Grimm was forced to have his mother pick him up from\ngames early. Id.^lX.\nThroughout his sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school, Mr. Grimm\ncontinued the process oftransitioning to live in accordance with his male identity. In December\n2014, the middle ofhis sophomore year, he had begun hormone therapy, which altered his bone\nand muscle structure, deepened his voice, and caused him to grow facial hair. Id. 72-73. In\nJune 2015, prior to the beginning ofhis junior year, the Virginia Department ofMotor Vehicles\nissuedMr. Grimma state identification carddesignating his genderas male. Id. 1] 74. A year\nlater, prior to the beginning of his senior year, Mr. Grimm underwent chest-reconstruction\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 6 of 31 PageID# 1528\nsurgery, in accordance with the medical standards ofcare for treating gender dysphoria.

Id. 76-77. Throughout the process of these changes—^up through Mr.\nGrimm's graduation in June 2017—^the School Board maintained that Mr. Grimm's \"biological\ngender\" was female and prohibited administrators from permitting Mr. Grimm to use the boys'\nrestrooms. Id. 78-79.\nMr. Grimm commenced this action against the Gloucester County School Board in July\n2015, alleging that the Board's policy of assigning students to restrooms based on their\nbiological sex violated Title DC ofthe Education Amendmentsof 1972,20 U.S.C. § 1681(a),as\nwell as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. In September 2015, another judge of this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion\nand Order(1) dismissing Mr. Grimm's claimunderTitle IX for failure to state a claimand(2)\ndenying his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction based on the alleged Title IX and Equal\nProtection Clause violations.

With respect to the Title IX claim\n(Count II, ECF No. 113 90-92), the School Board argues that its policy of separating\nrestrooms by physiological sex is valid under Title IX because (1)Title IX only allows for claims\non the basis ofsex, rather than gender identity, and (2) gender identity and sex, as addressed in\nTitleIX,arenot equivalent. SeeECFNo. 136at 6, 12-26. Withrespectto theEqualProtection\nclaim (Count I, ECF No. 113 81-89), the School Board argues that its policy does not violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause because transgender individuals are not members ofa suspect class\nentitled to heightened scrutiny, and the Policy should be viewed as presumptively constitutional\nunder both rational basis review and intermediate scrutiny.

Following Mr. Grimm's interlocutory appeal\nofthe dismissal, the Fourth Circuit reversed the dismissal. The reversal was based on the Fourth\nCircuit's conclusion that deference should be given to a guidance letter issued by the Department\nofEducation's Office ofCivil Rights that construed a Title IX regulation as generally requiring\nschools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity when electing to\nseparate students on the basis ofsex.

First, there has been a significant change in the applicable law\nsince the Motion to Dismiss the Title IX claim was initially considered in 2015.

The Sixth and SeventhCircuitshave since held that excluding\nboys and girls who are transgender from the restrooms that align with their gender identity may\nsubject them to discrimination on the basis ofsex under Title DC, the Equal Protection Clause, or\nboth. See Whitakerv. Kenosha UnifiedSchoolDist. No. 1 Board ofEducation, 858 F.3d 1034,\n1049-51 (7th Cir. 2017); Dodds v.

Although these precedents are not binding upon this Court,\nthe thorough analyses of analogous questions provided by the rulings proves persuasive.\n11\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 12 of 31 PageID# 1534\nMoreover, to the extent that the Fourth Circuit's consideration of the Title DC claim provides\nmeaningful guidance for this Court's analysis ofthe Title IX regulation, the earlier dismissal of\ntheTitle IXclaim lacked such guidance. Seeinfra p. 15and note 6.\nSecond, a number of factual developments warrant reconsideration of the original\ndecision to dismiss the Title DC claim. When Mr. Grimm filed his initial complaint in 2015, he\nalleged that the Board's policy violated his rights under Title DC on the day the policy was first\nissued, which occurred in the middle ofhis sophomore year. The Amended Complaint alleges\nthat the Board violated his rights under Title IXwhen the policy was issued, and also throughout\nthe remainder ofhis time as a student at Gloucester High School. Am.

A covered institution may not, on the basis of sex, (1)\n12\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 13 of 31 PageID# 1535\nprovide different aid,benefits, or services; (2)denyaid,benefits, or service, or (3) subject any\nperson toseparateor differentrules, sanctions, or treatment. 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(2)-(4).\nHowever, \"[n]ot all distinctions on the basis of sex are impermissible under Title DC.\"\nGrimm /, 822 F.3d at 718. The statute's regulations permit an institution to provide separate\nbathroom, shower, and locker facilities by sex, so long as the facilities are comparable. 34\nC.F.R. § 106.33; also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047-48.\n1. A Plaintiffs Claim ofDiscrimination on the Basis ofTransgender Status\nConstitutes a ClaimofSex Discrimination UnderTitle DC\nThe parties dispute whether a transgender student's allegation ofdiscrimination based on\nhis or her transgender status can constitute a claim ofsex discrimination under Title DC. Neither\nTitle DC nor its regulations defines the term \"sex.\" The Fourth Circuit has noted that because34\nC.F.R. § 106.33permits separate toilets, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis ofsex,\n\"[b]y implication,the regulation also permits schoolsto excludemales from the female facilities\nand vice-versa.\" Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 720.\nTheBoardnotesthat § 106.33 permitsschoolsto establishseparatefacilitiesonthebasis\nofsex. The Board also contends that the term \"sex\" \"at a minimum includes the physiological\ndistinction between men and women.\" ECF No. 136 at 13. Therefore, the Board argues, this\nCourt mustinterpretTitleDC asapplyingonlytodiscriminationonthebasisofphysiological sex,\nrather than gender identity. See id. at 12-26.\nBefore evaluating whether discrimination on the basis ofa plaintiffs transgender status\nconstitutes sex discrimination under Title DC, the Court must address the difficulties inherent in\nthe Board's view of\"sex\" under Title IX. That construction may be an appealingly simple way\nof interpreting the term \"sex.\" However, the Board argues that the Policy \"distinguishes boys\nand girls based on physical sex characteristics alone,\" ECF No. 136 at 21, but fails to\n13\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 14 of 31 PageID# 1536\nacknowledge that there are individuals who possess both male and female physical sex\ncharacteristics. As Mr. Grimm contends, attempting to draw lines based on physiological and\nanatomical characteristics proves unmanageable: how would the Board's policy apply to\nindividualswho have had genital surgery, individuals whose genitals were injured inan accident,\nor those with intersex traits who have genital characteristics that are neither typically male nor\nfemale? See Grimm /, 822 F.3d at720-21;^ Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3dat279 (\"[T]he Board has\nadopted a student bathroom policy that turns exclusively on the then-existing presence of a\ndeterminate external sex organ, no matter what other biological or gender markers may exist. ..\n.\"). In Mr. Grimm's situation, how would the Board have continued to implement the Policy\nafter Mr. Grimm's medical procedures? Mr, Grinmi had attainedsome secondary malephysical\nsex characteristics after hormonetherapyand chest reconstructionsurgery. Accordingly,actsof\ndiscrimination on the basis ofphysiological sex certainly could have occurred.\nThe Policy in question assigned restrooms based on \"biological gender,\" not\nphysiological characteristics. This term has not been accepted by the medical community,\nbecause \"sex\"—^the \"attributes that characterize biological maleness or femaleness\" (such as sex-\ndetermining genes, sex chromosomes, internal and external genitalia, and secondary sex\ncharacteristics)—isdistinct from\"gender,\" or the \"internal, deeplyheld sense\" ofbeinga manor\na woman.

Given the Policy's disregard for these distinctions,\nitsuseoftheterm\"biological gender\"functionedasaproxyforphysiologicalcharacteristicsthat\na student may or may not have had. The term allowed the Board to isolate, distinguish, and\nsubject to differential treatment any student who deviated from what the Board viewed a male or\nfemale student should be, and from the physiological characteristics the Board believed that a\nmale orfemale studentshouldhave.\nThe Court next turns to consideration of § 106.33. As the Fourth Circuit noted, the\n\"inquiry is not ended\" by §106.33's reference to males and females. Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 720.^\n\"Although the regulation may refer unambiguously to males and females, it is silent as to how a\nschool should determine whether a transgender individual is a male or female for the purpose of\naccess to sex-segregated restrooms.\" Id.

See ECF No. 136 at 16. However, as noted above, this fails to\naddress the question ofhow § 106.33 is to be interpreted regarding transgender students or other\nindividualswith physiological characteristics associated with both sexes.\nThe Court has some guidance in resolving § 106.33's ambiguity. Courts may \"look to\ncase lawinterpretingTitle VII ofthe CivilRightsActof1964,\"as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§2000e\net seq. (2018)—^which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of, among other\nqualities,sex—^\"for guidance in evaluatinga claim brought under Title IX.\" Id, at 718 (citing\nJennings v.

See 286 F. Supp. 3d at 713. However, the Supreme Court has\nconstructed a framework for addressing sex discrimination claims brought by individuals who\nfail to conform to social expectations for their gender group. In Price Waterhousev. Hopkins,\n490 U.S. 228, 235 (1989), the Supreme Court considered whether the plaintiff, a woman who\nwas denied partnership in an accounting firm, had an actionable Title VII claim against the firm\nbecause the firm had allegedly denied her a promotion because she failed to conform to certain\ngender stereotypes related to women. Id. at 235, 250-53 (summarizing how firm partners\n16\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 17 of 31 PageID# 1539\ndescribed the plaintiff as \"macho\" and a \"tough-talking somewhat masculine hard-nosed\nmanager\"). Firm partners advised the plaintiffthat her partnership chances would improveifshe\nwere to \"walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up,\nhaveher hair styled, and wearjewelry,\" Id. at 235. Six Justices ofthe Price WaterhouseCourt\nagreed that Title VII barred discrimination not only based on the plaintiffs gender, but based on\n\"sex stereotyping\" because the plaintiffhad failed to act in accordance with gender stereotypes\nassociated with women. Id. at 250-51; id. at 258-61 (White, J., concurring); id. at 272-73\n(O'Connor, J., concurring). In noting that \"we are beyond the day when an employer could\nevaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they match[] the stereotype associated with\ntheir group,\" the Price Waterhouse Court recognized that Title VII's prohibition on sex\ndiscriminationnecessarily includes aprohibition on genderstereotyping. Id. at251.\nPrice Waterhouse, by its own terms, took an expansive view as to the forms of sex\ndiscriminationthat Title VII was meant to reach, expressly leaving open the possibility ofother\nforms ofgender stereotyping. \"By focusing on [gender stereotypes associated with appearance\nand behavior], however, we do not suggest a limitation on the possible ways of proving that\nstereotypingplayedamotivatingroleinanemploymentdecision \" Id. at251-52.\nThe Supreme Court's expansion recognizes that the prohibition on sex discrimination\npursuant to Title VII also includes same-sex harassment claims. Oncale v.Sundowner Offshore\nServices, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998) (noting that same-sex \"sexual harassment in the workplace\nwas assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII,\" but\nthat \"statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable\n17\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 18 of 31 PageID# 1540\nevils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our\nlegislators bywhich we are govemed\")7\nThe First, Second, Third, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have all recognized that based on\nthe logic of Price Waterhouse, a gender stereotyping allegation generally is actionable sex\ndiscrimination under Title VII.

Mr. Grimm Has SufficientlyPled a Title DC Claim\nHaving concluded that Mr. Grimm may bring a Title IX claim based on his transgender\nstatus,this Court next turns to the questionofwhetherhe has pledhis claim ofdiscriminationon\nthebasisofsex sufficiently. To statea claimunderTitle IX,aplaintiffmust allege:(1)thatheor\nshe was excluded from participation in an education program because ofhis or her sex; (2) that\nthe educational institution was receiving federal financial assistance at the time of his or\nexclusion; and(3)thatthe improperdiscrimination causedtheplaintiffharm. Grimm /, 822F.3d\nat 718 (citing Preston v. Virginia ex rel NewRiver Cmty. Coll, 31 F.3d 203, 206 (4th Cir.\n1994));but cf. 286 F. Supp. 3d at 716-17 (finding plaintiffhad stated a Title DC claim\nundera genderstereotyping theory becausehe had allegedthat he was denied accessto the boys'\nlocker room on the basis ofsex—^that is, his transgender status); Evancho, 237 F. Supp. at 295\n(describing the three requirements for stating a Title DC claim as (1) discrimination in an\neducational program that (2) receives federal assistance in which (3) such discrimination was on\nthe basis ofsex).\nBefore considering whether Mr. Grimm has stated a plausible Title DC claim, the Court\nrecognizes the similarities between this case and Whitaker, in which a transgender male teenager\nwas also subjected to a school policy in which he could use only the girls' restrooms or gender-\nneutral restrooms that were far from his classrooms. 858 F.3d at 1040, 1041-42. This limitation\nwas imposed despite the undisputed facts that the plaintiffhad begun sociallytransitioning to life\nas a male during his freshman year, including changing his legal name and pronouns, and had\nbeen diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a therapist. As a result of the school policy, the\nplaintiffsuffered from depression and anxiety; avoided water intake to avoid needing to use the\n21\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 22 of 31 PageID# 1544\nrestroom,thereby exacerbatingmedical issues;and contemplatedsuicide. He also attemptedto\nuse the boys' restrooms in violation ofthe administration's decision. In response, administrators\nremoved him from class on several occasions and instructed security guards to monitor his\nrestroom use. Id. at 1040-41. Eventually, the school permitted him to use the boys' restrooms\nafter a surgical transition. Id. at 1041. In reviewing the facts as alleged by the plaintiff, the\nSeventhCircuitconcludedthat the plaintiffhad establisheda likelihoodof successonthe merits\nofhis Title DC, and affirmed the district court's granting ofa preliminary injunction on behalfof\nthe plaintiff. Id. at 1050.\nThe Court now considers the first prong in determining if the Title IX claim is pled\nsufficiently: whether Mr. Grimm has sufficiently alleged that he was improperly discriminated\nagainst on the basis ofhis sex—^that is, his transgender status. The Seventh Circuit concluded\nthat a policy that requires transgender students to use bathrooms not in conformitywith their\ngenderidentity subjects \"a transgenderstudent ... to differentrules, sanctions, and treatment\nthannon-transgenderstudents,\" and amountsto discriminationon the basisoftransgenderstatus\ninviolation ofTitle IX. Whitaker,858 F.3d at 1049-50. This conclusion is sound. Furthermore,\nthe provision ofa gender-neutral alternative is insufficient to relieve a school board ofliability,\n\"as it is the policy itself which violates [Title IX].\" See id. at 1050. Offering restroom\nalternatives that impose hardships like unreasonable distances to a student's classroom and\nincreased stigma on astudentis inadequate. See id.\nInM.A.B., the District ofMaryland recognized that because the plaintiffhad alleged that\nthe school board had denied him access to the boys' locker rooms because of his transgender\nstatus, the policy subjectedhim to sex discriminationunder a gender stereotypingtheory. M.A.B.\nconcluded that the plaintiffhad sufficiently alleged discrimination under Title DC. 286 F. Supp.\n22\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 23 of 31 PageID# 1545\n3d at716. Given the persuasive reasoningin Whitaker and the Court concludesthat Mr.\nGrimmhas sufficientlypled that the Policysubjectedhim to sex discrimination xmder a gender\nstereotypingtheory.\nHaving concluded that Mr. Grimm has properly alleged discrimination on the basis of\nsex, and finding the second pleading requirement is met because GCPS and GloucesterHigh\nSchool \"are education programs receiving Federalfinancial assistance,\" ECFNo. 113 ^ 91,the\nCourt now turns to determining whether Mr. Grimm has sufficiently alleged that the\ndiscrimination harmed him. The location ofthe bathrooms, coupled with the stigmatization and\nphysical andmentalanguishinflicteduponMr.Grimm,causedharm. \"A policythatrequiresan\nindividualto use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity punishes that\nindividual for his or her gender non-conformance, which in turn violatesTitle DC.\" Whitaker,\n858 F.3d at 1049; see also id. at 1041 (noting that, among other harms, the plaintiff suffered\nfi^om depression and anxiety because ofthe bathroom policy, and restricted his water intake to\navoid restroom use, exacerbating his medical problems); 286 F. Supp. 3d at 716-17\n(applying Whitaker to concludethat the plaintiffhadsufficientlypled a Title IX claimbasedon\nthe school's policy of excluding him from use of the boys' locker room because of his\ntransgender status). After full consideration ofthe facts presented and the compelling scope of\nrelevant legal analyses, the Court concludes that Mr. Grimm has sufficiently pled a Title IX\nclaimofsex discriminationundera genderstereotypingtheory.\nC. Equal Protection Claim\nMr. Grimm also brings a claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution (ECF No. 113 81-89), which provides that\n\"[n]o State shall. . . deny to any person within itsjurisdiction the equal protection ofthe laws.\"\nU.S. Const, amend. XIV § 1. As Whitaker recognized, the Equal Protection Clause \"is\n23\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 24 of 31 PageID# 1546\nessentially a directive that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" 858 F.3d at\n1050 (quoting City ofCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)). Under\n\"rational basis review,\" state action will generally be presumed to be lawful and upheld ifthe\nclassification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. City of\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 440. However, a state must not distinguish between classes ofpeople in\nan \"arbitrary or irrational\" manner or out ofa \"bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular\ngroup.\" Id. at 446-47 (internal citation omitted).\nUnder \"rational basis review,\" ifa state classification ofa group ofpeople is rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state interest, courts will uphold the classifications. Id. at 440. However,\nwhen a state classifies a \"suspect\" or \"quasi-suspect\" group of people, courts will apply\n\"heightenedscrutiny.\" Mat440-41.\nSex-basedclassificationsare subject to heightenedscrutiny. The state bears the burden\nof demonstrating that its proffered justification for the use of a sex-based classification is\n\"exceedingly persuasive.\" UnitedStates v. Virginia,518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). That is, the state\nis required to demonstrate that the classification \"serves important governmental objectives and\nthat the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those\nobjectives.\" Id. at 524 (intemal citation omitted). Hypothesized or post hoc justifications\ncreated inresponse to litigation are insufficient to meetthis burden, as arejustifications based on\noverbroad generalizations about sex. Id. at 533. Furthermore, \"[i[fa state actor cannot defend a\nsex-based classification by relying upon overbroad generalizations, it follows that sex-based\nstereotypes are also insufficient sustain a classification.\" Kenosha, 858 F.3d at 1051 (intemal\ncitationomitted).\n24\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 25 of 31 PageID# 1547\n1. The Board's PolicyWarrants Intermediate Scrutiny\nThe parties dispute which level of scrutiny is warranted. The Board contends that\nrational basis review should apply because transgender individuals do not constitute a quasi-\nsuspect class under the Equal Protection Clause. ECF No. 136at 28. Mr. Grimm contends that\nclassification based upon transgender status amounts to classification based on sex, and so\nwarrants heightenedscrutiny. ECF No. 139at 37-38.\nThe Fourth Circuit has not considered the question ofwhether transgender classifications\nare sex-based. See 286 F. Supp. 3d at 718. The Seventh and Eleventh Circuits have\nconsidered the issue and have concluded that heightened scrutiny applies. See Whitaker, 858\nF,3d at 1051; Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1321. This Court agrees and concludes that intermediate\nscrutinyis warranted for at least two reasons.\nFirst, transgender individuals constitute at least a quasi-suspect class, and the Policy\nclassified Mr. Grimm on the basis of his transgender status. See 286 F. Supp. 3d at\n718-20. Four factors are used to determine whether a group ofpeople who have been classified\nby a state amount to a suspect or quasi-suspect class: (1) whether the class has historically been\nsubject to discrimination, Bowenv. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); (2) whether the class has\na defining characteristic that bears a relation to ability to perform or contribute to society,\nClebume, 473 U.S. at 440-41; (3) whether the class exhibits obvious, immutable, or\ndistinguishing characteristics that define the class as a discrete group, Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602;\nand (4) whether the class is a minority or politically powerless. Id. This Court joins the District\nof Maryland in concluding that transgender individuals meet all four factors and constitute at\nleast a quasi-suspectclass.\nAs to the first factor, there is no doubt that transgender individuals historically have been\nsubjected to discrimination on the basis oftheir gender identity, including high rates ofviolence\n25\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 26 of 31 PageID# 1548\nanddiscrimination in education, employment, housing, and healthcare access. See Whitaker, 858\nF.3d at 1051; 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720; see also Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 288;\nHighland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874; Adkins v. City ofNew York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 139\n(S.D.N.Y. 2015).\nThe second factor is also met because transgender status has no bearing on a transgender\nindividual's ability to contribute to society. See 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720.\nAs to the third factor, \"transgender status is immutable.\" Id. at 720-21. Furthermore,\ntransgender individuals have distinguishing characteristics—^the disparity between the gender\nthey were assigned at birth and the gender they identify with—^that define them as a discrete\ngroup. Id. at 721.\nAs to the fourth factor, there can be no doubt that transgender individuals are a minority\nand are politically powerless, comprising just a fraction of the population and frequently\nsubjected to discriminatory federal policies and state laws. Id. at 721. This Court joins the\nDistrict of Maryland, as well as a host of other district courts, in concluding that because\ntransgender individuals are part of a quasi-suspect class, classifications based on transgender\nstatus are per se entitled to heightened scrutiny. Id. at 720-22; see also Doe 1 v. Trump, 21S F.\nSupp. 3d 167, 208-09 (D.D.C. 2017); Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 288; Highland, 208 F. Supp.\n3d at 874;Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139-40; Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1104, 1119\n(N.D. Cal. 2015).\nSecond, intermediate scrutiny is also warranted because, as Mr. Grimm has pled the\nmatter, the Board Policy at issue relies on sex stereotypes. Accordingly, Mr. Grimm's claims\namount to an allegation ofa sex-based classification and, therefore, an allegation of sex-based\n26\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 27 of 31 PageID# 1549\ndiscrimination in violation ofthe Equal Protection Clause. See 286 F. Supp. 3d at 718-\n19.\nIn Whitaker, the Seventh Circuit declined to conclude whether \"transgender status is per\nse entitled to heightened scrutiny,\" but recognized that \"it is enough to say that,just as in Price\nWaterhouse\" that the record demonstrated that the plaintiffhad been subject to sex stereotyping\nand therefore had experienced sex discrimination, Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051. The court\nreasoned that because \"the School District decides which bathroom a student may use based\nupon the sex listed on the student's birth certificate,\" the policy could not be stated without\nreferencing sex. Id. Accordingly, Whitakerconcluded, \"[t]his policy is inherently based upon a\nsex-classification,\" and \"heightened review applies.\" Id.\\ see also Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1319-20\n(recognizing that the consistent purpose of applying intermediate scrutiny to sex-based\nclassifications has been to eliminate discrimination on the basis of gender stereotypes, and\nconcludingthat discrimination against a transgenderindividualbecause ofhis or her gendernon\nconformityconstitutes sex discriminationunder the Equal Protection Clause).\nThis Court joins other courts that have concluded that because the Policy relies on sex-\nbased stereotypes, it is a sex-based classification. See M.A.B.,286 F. Supp. 3d at 718-19. The\nPolicy classified Mr. Grimm differently on the basis ofhis transgender status and, accordingly,\nsubjected him to sex stereotyping. The Equal Protection Clause protects Mr. Grimm from\nimpermissible sex stereotypes—just as Title IX does, for the reasons articulated previously—and\nthe Court need only find that the Board's Policy demonstrated sex stereotyping under the Equal\nProtection Clause. Cf.Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. 250-52. Mr. Grimm was subjected to sex\ndiscrimination because he was viewed as failing to conform to the sex stereotype propagated by\n27\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 28 of 31 PageID# 1550\nthe Policy. Because the Policyrelies on sex-basedstereotypes,the Court finds that reviewofthe\nPolicyis subjectto intermediate scrutiny.\n2. As Pled by Mr. Grimm, the Policy was Not SubstantiallyRelated to\nAchieving an ImportantGovernmental Objective\nThe Court next turns to whether the Policy survives review under heightened scrutiny.\nTo survive, the Board must demonstrate that the classification serves an important governmental\nobjective, and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the\nachievementofthose objectives. Virginia,518U.S. at 533 (internal citation omitted).\nThe Board argues that the Policy is substantially related to an important governmental\nobjective: protectingthe privacyrights of its students. See ECF No. 136at 35-37. The Board\nexpands this argument by contending that concerns over student privacy extend to protecting\nstudents like Mr. Grimm who, for whatever reason, may be uncomfortable using a restroom\ncorrespondingwith theirphysiological sex. The Boardarguesthatby permitting suchstudentsto\nuse a single-userrestroom, the Board is alsoprotectingthe privacyofstudents like Mr. Grimm.\nId. at 36.\nThe Board's argument rings hollow. In Whitaker, the Seventh Circuit concluded that\nalthoughthe school's privacyjustification may be a legitimate and important interest,the policy\nwas not genuinebecause it is \"based uponsheer conjectureandabstraction.\" Whitaker, 858F.3d\nat 1052; seealso Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 723.\nSuch conjecture is obvious. First, the plaintiffin Whitaker—like Mr. Grimm—^used the\nboys' bathrooms for weeks without incident before other adults in the community—not\nstudents—complained of this use. Second, as the Seventh Circuit observed, a \"transgender\nstudent's presence in a restroom provides no more ofa risk to other students' privacyrights than\nthe presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex who decides to sneak\n28\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 29 of 31 PageID# 1551\nglancesathis or her classmates performingtheir bodily functions.\" Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052.\nThird, ifschool districts were genuinely concernedwith protecting the privacy ofstudentswho\nhave different-looking anatomies, \"then it would seem that separate bathrooms also would be\nappropriate for pre-pubescent and post-pubescent children who do not look alike anatomically,\"\nwhich the school district had not provided. Id. at 1052-53. This Court declines to further\nevaluate the legitimacy of the purported privacy concerns. The record here is less developed\nthan it was in Whitaker. However, the Court underscores that, as pled by Mr. Grimm, Mr.\nGrimmused the boys' bathrooms for weeks withoutincident.\nThe Courtconcludes that, as pledby Mr. Grimm, the policy at issue was notsubstantially\nrelated to protecting other students' privacy rights. See 286 F. Supp. 3d at724-26.'^\nThere were many other ways to protect privacy interests in a non-discriminatory and more\neffective manner than barring Mr. Grimm from using the boys' restrooms. For example, the\nBoard had taken steps \"to give all students the option for even greater privacy\" by installing\npartitions between urinals and privacy strips for stall doors. ECF No. 113 H57. Additionally,\nstudents who wanted greater privacy for any reason could have used one ofthe new single-stall\nrestrooms made available upon implementation ofthe policy. See Grimm /, 822 F.3d at 728-29\n(Davis, J., concurring). Furthermore, as the M.A.B. court recognized, it is significant when a\nThe CourtemphasizesthatM.A.B. rejectedthedefendants' argumentthatsingle-userestrooms\nandstallsintheboys' lockerroomwouldbeinsufficienttoassuageprivacyconcems,because\"ifM.A.B.\nchanging clothes in the designated restrooms makes him feel humiliated and embarrassed . . . then\nstudentswhousethoserestroomsforgreaterprivacywillfeelthesameway.\" 286F.Supp.3dat724.\nM.A.B. rejected that argument for fourreasons:(1)thepolicy interferedwith M.A.B.'s healthand\nwell-being because it prevented him from social transitioning, as required for treating his gender\ndysphoria; (2) M.A.B. was required to use the designatedrestrooms, unlike the students who had the\noption to do so if they desired greater privacy; (3) the policy singled out M.A.B. \"and marks him as\ndifferent for being transgender,\" again in contrast to students for whom using a single-stall restroom\ncarried nostigma; and(4)\"evenif someboysfeel humiliated, embarrassed, oralienated fordeciding to\nchange clothes in a single-use restroom or stall, changing there still serves [the defendants'] privacy\nconcems because thoseboysstillenjoygreaterprivacy.\" Id.at 724-25. TheCourtagrees withMA.B.'s\nreasoning.\n29\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 148   Filed 05/22/18   Page 30 of 31 PageID# 1552\nschool board fails to provide \"any explanation for why completely barring [the transgender\nstudent] from the boys' [segregated facility] protects the privacy of other boys,\" \"while the\navailability ofsingle-use restrooms or locker stalls does not.\" 286 F. Supp. 3d at 725.\nAs in Whitaker and preventing Mr. Grimm from using the boys' restrooms did nothing\nto protect the privacy rights of other students, but certainly singled out and stigmatized Mr.\nGrimm. Id.\nSimilarly, the Board's argument that the policy should not be construed as violating the\nEqual Protection Clause because the policy treated all boys and girls the same is unavailing.\nECF No. 136 at 26-37. The Policy singled out Mr, Grimm for differing treatment because it\n\"treat[ed] transgender students . . . who fail to conform to the sex-based stereotypes associated\nwith their assigned sex at birth[] differently,\" whereas a boy making the personal choice to\nchangeclothesin or use a single-stallrestroomwould not havebeen singledout by the school\npolicy. Whitaker^ 858 F.3d at 1051; see also Grimm/, 822 F.3d at 729 (Davis, J., concurring)\n(\"For other students, using the single-stallrestrooms carries no stigma whatsoever,whereas for\nG.G., using those same restrooms is tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of\ndifference among his fellow students.\").\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Mr. Grimm has sufficiently pled that the\nPolicy was not substantially related to protecting other students' privacy rights, because there\nwere many other ways to protect privacy interests in a non-discriminatory and more effective\nmanner than barring Mr. Grimm from using the boys' restrooms. The Board's argument that the\npolicy did not discriminate against any one class of students is resoundingly unpersuasive.\nAccordingly, the Courtdeclines to dismiss his Equal ProtectionClaim.\nIV.

In \nthis case, a Department of Education official opined in an \nunpublished letter that Title IX’s prohibition of “sex” \ndiscrimination  “include[s]  gender  identity,”  and  that  a \nfunding recipient providing sex-separated facilities un-\nder  the  regulation  “must  generally  treat  transgender \nstudents  consistent  with  their  gender  identity.”  App. \n128a, 100a. The Fourth Circuit afforded this letter “con-\ntrolling” deference under the doctrine of Auer v. Rob-\nbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997). On remand the district court \nentered a preliminary injunction requiring the petitioner \nschool board to allow respondent—who was born a girl \nbut identifies as a boy—to use the boys’ restrooms at \nschool.  \nThe questions presented are:     \n1.

For \nthat and several other reasons, this case provides the \nperfect vehicle for revisiting the deference doctrine ar-\nticulated in Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), and \nsubsequently criticized by several Justices of this Court. \nThe statute at the heart of the administrative inter-\npretation here is Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972. Enacted over forty years ago, Title IX and its \nimplementing regulation have always allowed schools to \nprovide “separate toilet, locker rooms, and shower facili-\nties on the basis of sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. No one ever \nthought this was discriminatory or illegal. And for dec-\nades our Nation’s schools have structured their facilities \nand programs around the idea that in certain intimate \nsettings men and women may be separated “to afford \nmembers of each sex privacy from the other sex.” United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996). \nThe Fourth Circuit’s decision turns that longstanding \nexpectation upside down. Deferring to the views of a rel-\natively low-level official in the Department of Education \n(Department), the court reasoned that for purposes of \nTitle IX the term “sex” does not simply mean physiologi-\ncal males and females, which is what Congress and the \nDepartment (and everyone else) thought the term meant \nwhen the regulation was promulgated. Instead, the De-\npartment and the Fourth Circuit now tell us that “sex” is \nambiguous as applied to persons whose subjective gen-\n\n2  \nder identity diverges from their physiological sex. App. \n17a–20a. According to the Fourth Circuit, this means a \nphysiologically  female  student  who  self-identifies  as  a \nmale—as does the plaintiff here—must be allowed un-\nder Title IX to use the boys’ restroom. \nThe Fourth Circuit reached this conclusion, not by in-\nterpreting the text of Title IX or its implementing regu-\nlation (neither of which refers to gender identity), but by \ndeferring to an agency opinion letter written just last \nyear by James Ferg-Cadima, the Acting Deputy Assis-\ntant Secretary for Policy for the Department of Educa-\ntion’s Office of Civil Rights. App. 121a. The letter is un-\npublished; its advice has never been subject to notice and \ncomment; and it was generated in direct response to an \ninquiry about the Board’s restroom policy in this very \ncase. Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit concluded—over \nJudge  Niemeyer’s  dissent—that  the  letter  was  due \n“controlling” deference under Auer. App. 25a. On that \nbasis, the district court immediately entered a prelimi-\nnary  injunction  allowing  the  plaintiff  to  use  the  boys’  \nrestroom.  \nShortly after the Fourth Circuit’s decision, the De-\npartment (along with the Department of Justice) issued \na “Dear Colleague” letter seeking to impose that same \nrequirement on every Title IX-covered educational insti-\ntution  in  the  Nation.  But  just  last  week,  the  Depart-\nments’ effort was halted by a nationwide injunction is-\nsued by a federal district judge in Texas.  \nThese recent developments highlight the urgent need \nfor this Court to grant this petition and resolve the is-\n \n \n\n3  \nsues presented by the Fourth Circuit’s decision. As ex-\nplained in more detail below, the Court should grant the \npetition for three reasons. First, this case provides an \nexcellent vehicle for reconsidering—and abolishing or \nrefining—the Auer doctrine. Second, if the Court de-\ncides to retain Auer in some form, this case provides an \nexcellent vehicle for resolving important disagreements \namong the lower courts about Auer’s proper application. \nThird, this case provides an excellent vehicle for deter-\nmining whether the Department’s understanding of Title \nIX reflected in the Ferg-Cadima and “Dear Colleague” \nletters  must  be  given  effect—thereby  resolving  once \nand for all the current nationwide controversy generated \nby these directives. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThis petition seeks review of two related cases in the \ncourt of appeals, Nos. 15-2056 and 16-1733. No. 15-2056 \nis G.G’s appeal of the district court’s order denying his \nrequest for a preliminary injunction. The opinion of the \ncourt of appeals in that case is available at 822 F.3d 709 \n(4th Cir. 2016). App. 1a–60a. The district court’s opinion \nin that case is available at 132 F.Supp.3d 736 (E.D. Va. \n2015). App. 84a–117a. \nNo.  16-1733  is  the  Board’s  appeal  of  the  district \ncourt’s order granting a preliminary injunction after the \nremand in No. 15-2056. The district court’s opinion in \nthat case is available at 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93164. \nApp. 71a–72a. \n \n \n\n4  \nJURISDICTION \nIn  No.  15-2056,  the  court  of  appeals  entered  its \njudgment  on  April  19,  2016.  App.  3a.  It  denied  the \nBoard’s petition for rehearing en banc on May 31, 2016. \nApp. 61a. No. 16-1733 remains pending in the court of \nappeals. The Board timely filed this petition for a writ of \ncertiorari on August 29, 2016. See 28 U.S.C. § 2101(c). \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 pro-\nvides, in relevant part: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance \n. . . \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 provides:  \nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut such facilities provided for students of one \nsex shall be comparable to such facilities pro-\nvided for students of the other sex. \n \n \n\n5  \nSTATEMENT \nA.  Facts \nG.G.  is  a  17-year-old  student  at  Gloucester  High \nSchool.  G.G.  is  biologically  female,  meaning  that  G.G. \nwas born a girl and recorded as a girl on the birth certifi-\ncate. “However, at a very young age, G.G. did not feel \nlike a girl,” and around age twelve began identifying as a \nboy. App. 85a. In July 2014, between G.G.’s freshman and \nsophomore years, G.G. changed his first name to a boy’s \nname  and  began  referring  to  himself  with  male  pro-\nnouns.1 He has also started hormone therapy, but has not \nhad a sex-change operation. \nIn August 2014, before the start of G.G.’s sophomore \nyear, G.G. and his mother met with the principal and \nguidance counselor to discuss G.G.’s situation. The school \nofficials were supportive of G.G. and promised a welcom-\ning environment. School records were changed to reflect \nG.G.’s new name, and the guidance counselor helped G.G. \ne-mail his teachers asking them to address G.G. using his \nmale name and male pronouns. App. 87a–88a. As G.G. \nadmits, teachers and staff have honored these requests. \nId. at 148a. \nNeither G.G. nor school officials, however, thought \nthat G.G. should start using the boys’ restrooms, locker \n                                                   \n1  This petition uses “he,” “him,” and “his” to respect G.G.’s de-\nsire to be referred to with male pronouns. That choice does not con-\ncede anything on the legal question of what G.G.’s “sex” is for pur-\nposes of Title IX and its implementing regulation. \n \n \n\n6  \nrooms, or shower facilities. Instead, G.G. and his mother \nsuggested G.G. use a separate restroom in the nurse’s \noffice rather than the boys’ room, and the school agreed. \nApp. 149a. G.G. claims he accepted this arrangement be-\ncause he was “unsure how other students would react to \n[his] transition.” Id. But four weeks into the school year \nG.G. changed his mind and sought permission to use the \nboys’ restroom. The principal granted G.G.’s request on \nOctober 20, 2014. G.G. says he asked for access to the \nboys’ restroom because he found it “stigmatizing” to use \nthe restroom in the nurse’s office. Id.  \nImmediately after G.G. started using the boys’ rest-\nrooms, the Board began receiving complaints from par-\nents and students who regarded G.G.’s presence in the \nboys’ room as an invasion of student privacy. App. 144a. \nParents also expressed general concerns that allowing \nstudents into restrooms and locker rooms of the opposite \nbiological sex could enable voyeurism or sexual assault. \nThe Board held public meetings on November 11 and \nDecember 9, 2014, to consider the issue, and citizens on \nboth sides expressed their views in thoughtful and re-\nspectful terms.2 At the December 9 meeting, the Board \n                                                   \n2  The Fourth Circuit’s opinion tries to depict the citizens who \nopposed G.G’s presence in the boys’ room as largely “hostil[e]” to \nG.G., selectively quoting the few intemperate statements and subtly \nimplying they represented the whole. App. 10a. The video of the \nmeetings, however, shows that the overwhelming majority of those \nexpressing concern did so with courtesy and decency, not “hostility.” \nSee  http://bit.ly/2bsVO6h  (Dec.  9,  2014  meeting); \nhttp://www.gloucesterva.info/channels47and48  (containing  link  to \nNov. 11, 2014 meeting video). \n \n \n\n7  \nadopted  a  resolution  recognizing  “that  some  students \nquestion their gender identities,” and encouraging “such \nstudents to seek support, advice, and guidance from par-\nents, professionals and other trusted adults.” The resolu-\ntion then concluded:  \nWhereas the [Board] seeks to provide a safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore \nIt shall be the practice of the [Board] to pro-\nvide  male  and  female  restroom  and  locker \nroom facilities in its schools, and the use of said \nfacilities shall be limited to the corresponding \nbiological genders, and students with gender \nidentity issues shall be provided an alternative \nappropriate private facility. \nId. at 144a.  \nBefore the Board adopted this resolution, the high \nschool announced it would install three single-stall uni-\nsex bathrooms throughout the building—regardless of \nwhether the Board approved the December 9 resolution. \nThese unisex restrooms would be open to all students \nwho, for whatever reason, desire greater privacy. They \nopened for use shortly after the Board adopted the reso-\nlution. G.G., however, refuses to use these unisex bath-\nrooms because, he says, they “make me feel even more \nstigmatized and isolated than when I use the restroom in \nthe nurse’s office.” App. 151a. \n \n \n\n8  \nA  few  days  after  the  Board’s  decision,  a  lawyer \nnamed Emily T. Prince3 sent an e-mail about the Board’s \nresolution to the Department, asking whether it had any \n“guidance  or  rules”  relevant  to  the  Board’s  decision. \nApp. 118a–120a. In response, on January 7, 2015, James \nA. Ferg-Cadima, an Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary \nfor Policy in the Department’s Office of Civil Rights sent \na letter stating that “Title IX . . . prohibits recipients of \nFederal financial assistance from discriminating on the \nbasis  of  sex,  including  gender  identity,”  and  further \nopining that:  \nThe Department’s Title IX regulations permit \nschools  to  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms \nlocker rooms, shower facilities, housing, athlet-\nic teams, and single-sex classes under certain \ncircumstances. When a school elects to sepa-\nrate or treat students differently on the basis \nof sex in those situations, a school generally \nmust  treat  transgender  students  consistent \nwith their gender identity.  \nApp. 121a, 123a (emphasis added).  \nThe Ferg-Cadima letter cites no document requiring \nschools to treat transgender students “consistent with \ntheir gender identity” regarding restroom, locker room, \nor shower access. It instead cites a Q&A sheet on the \n                                                   \n3  Ms.  Prince  describes  herself  as  the  “Sworn  Knight  of  the \nTranssexual  Empire.”  See  https://twitter.com/emily_esque?lang= \nen. Her name appears in the signature of the e-mail that DOJ filed \nin the district court, when the file is opened in Preview for Mac. \n \n \n\n9  \nDepartment website, which says only that schools must \ntreat transgender students consistent with their gender \nidentity  when  holding  single-sex  classes.  See  United \nStates  Department  of  Education,  Questions  and  An-\nswers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Sec-\nondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities (Dec. 1, \n2014),\thttp://bit.ly/1HRS6yI (emphasis added) (last vis-\nited Aug. 29, 2016) (Q&A #31) (opining “[h]ow . . . the \nTitle  IX  requirements  on  single-sex  classes  apply  to \ntransgender students) (emphasis added). \nB.  District Court Proceedings \nG.G. filed suit against the Board on June 11, 2015—\ntwo days after the end of the 2014–15 school year. His \ncomplaint  alleged  that  the  Board’s  resolution  violated \nTitle IX and the Equal Protection Clause, and sought \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys \nfees.  \nOn June 29, 2015, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) \nfiled a “statement of interest” accusing the Board of vio-\nlating Title IX. See App. 160a–183a. The statement did \nnot even cite 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, let alone explain how the \nBoard’s policy could be unlawful under the regulation’s \ntext. Instead, DOJ trumpeted the Ferg-Cadima letter as \nthe “controlling” interpretation of Title IX and the regu-\nlation, even though DOJ acknowledged that the letter \nhad never been “publicly issued.” See id. at 171.4 DOJ \n                                                   \n4  DOJ cited two other documents issued by the Department of \nEducation,  but  neither  addresses  whether  schools  must  allow \ntransgender students into restrooms or locker rooms that corre-\n(continued…) \n \n \n\n10  \nalso asserted that “an individual’s gender identity is one \naspect of an individual’s sex,” id. at 169a, but failed to \ncite  any  statute  or  regulation  adopting  or  supporting \nthat view. \nWithout ruling on G.G.’s equal-protection claim, the \ndistrict court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim and denied \na preliminary injunction. See App. 82a–83a (order); 84a–\n117a  (opinion).  It  held  that  G.G.’s  Title  IX  claim  was \nforeclosed by 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, the regulation allowing \ncomparable separate restrooms and other facilities “on \nthe basis of sex.” App. 97a–98a.  \nThe district court assumed, for the sake of argument, \nthat the phrase “on the basis of sex” includes distinctions \nbased on both gender identity as well as biological sex. \nApp.  99a,  102a.  Yet  even  under  this  broad  reading  of \n“sex,” it would remain permissible under section 106.33 \nto separate restrooms by biological sex or gender identi-\nty. Consequently, as the district court pointed out, section \n106.33 would forbid the Board’s policy only if “sex” re-\nfers solely to distinctions based on gender identity, and \nexcludes those based on biological sex. Id. at 99a. The \ndistrict court held that this would be an absurd construc-\ntion, however. Indeed, if applied to the Title IX statute, it \nwould permit discrimination against men or women, so \nlong as the recipient discriminates on account of gender \nidentity rather than biological sex. Id. at 102a. \n                                                                                                        \nspond with their gender identity. See ECF No. 28 at 9; see also, su-\npra, at 7–8. \n \n \n\n11  \nConsequently, the district court refused to give con-\ntrolling weight to the interpretation of Title IX and 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.33 in the Ferg-Cadima letter. First, the dis-\ntrict court observed that letters of this sort lack the force \nof law under Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, \n587 (2000), and cannot receive Chevron deference when \ninterpreting Title IX. App. 101a. The Court also held \nthat the letter should not receive deference under Auer \nv. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), because it contradicts the \nunambiguous language of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which al-\nlows schools to establish separate restrooms “on the ba-\nsis of sex”—even if one assumes that “on the basis of \nsex” refers to both gender identity and biological sex. \nThus, the district court regarded the Ferg-Cadima letter \nas an attempted amendment to, rather than an interpre-\ntation of, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, and held that to be binding \nany  such  amendment  must  go  through  notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking. App. 102a–103a. \nC.  Appeal  to  the  Fourth  Circuit  in  No.  15-\n2056 \nOver Judge Niemeyer’s dissent, the Fourth Circuit \nreversed the district court’s dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX \nclaim, and held that the district court should have en-\nforced the Ferg-Cadima letter as the authoritative con-\nstruction of Title IX and 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 under Auer. \nApp. 13a–25a. \nFirst, the panel held that section 106.33 was “ambig-\nuous” as applied to “whether a transgender individual is \na  male  or  a  female  for  the  purpose  of  access  to  sex-\nsegregated restrooms,” and that the Ferg-Cadima letter \n \n \n\n12  \n“resolve[d]” this ambiguity by determining sex solely by \nreference to “gender identity.” Id. at 19a, 18a.  \nSecond, the panel held that the letter’s interpreta-\ntion—“although perhaps not the intuitive one,” id. at \n23a—was not, in the words of Auer, “plainly erroneous \nor inconsistent with the regulation or the statute.” Id. at \n20a. In the panel’s view, the term “sex” does not neces-\nsarily suggest “a hard-and-fast binary division [of males \nand females] on the basis of reproductive organs.” Id. at \n22a.  \nThird, the panel found that the letter’s interpretation \nwas a result of the agency’s “fair and considered judg-\nment,” because the agency had consistently enforced this \nposition “since 2014”—that is, for the previous several \nmonths—and it was “in line with” other federal agency \nguidance.  Id.  at  24a.  While  conceding  that  the  Ferg-\nCadima  interpretation  was  “novel,”  given  that  “there \nwas no interpretation of how section 106.33 applied to \ntransgender individuals before January 2015,” the panel \nnonetheless thought this novelty was no reason to deny \nAuer deference. Id. at 23a. \nThe  panel,  however,  did  not  address  the  district \ncourt’s reason for rejecting the agency interpretation—\nnamely, that it would make the phrase “on the basis of \nsex”  exclude  biological  sex  and  refer  only  to  gender \nidentity,  a construction that would absurdly mean that \nTitle IX no longer protects men or women from discrim-\nination on the basis of biological sex. App. 99a, 102a. Nor \ndid the panel acknowledge that the agency was expressly \ninterpreting the Title IX statute, not merely the regula-\n \n \n\n13  \ntion. See App. 121a (stating that “Title IX . . . prohibits \n[funding] recipients . . . from discriminating on the basis \nof sex, including gender identity . . . .”) (emphases add-\ned). The panel thus did not address the district court’s \nconclusion  that  giving  the  letter  controlling  deference \nwould permit agencies to “avoid the process of formal \nrulemaking by announcing regulations through simple \nquestion and answer publications.” App. 103a \nJudge Niemeyer dissented from the panel’s decision \nto give controlling effect to the Ferg-Cadima letter, for \nmany of the reasons given by the district court. App. \n40a–60a. Judge Niemeyer explained that the premise for \napplying Auer was absent, because “Title IX and its im-\nplementing regulations are not ambiguous” in allowing \nseparate restrooms and other facilities on the basis of \n“sex.” Id. at 43a. To the contrary, those provisions “em-\nploy[ ] the term ‘sex’ as was generally understood at the \ntime  of  enactment,”  as  referring  to  “the  physiological \ndistinctions  between  males  and  females,  particularly \nwith respect to their reproductive functions.” Id. at 53a–\n55a. He also explained that the DOJ’s conflation of “sex” \nin Title IX with “gender identity” would produce “un-\nworkable and illogical result[s],” undermining the priva-\ncy and safety concerns that motivated the allowance of \nsex-separated facilities in the first place. Id. at 42a–43a. \nJudge Niemeyer also noted that the Fourth Circuit’s \nendorsement  of  the  Ferg-Cadima  letter  will  require \nschools to allow students with gender-identity issues not \nonly into the restrooms but also into the locker rooms \nand showers reserved for the opposite biological sex. In \nJudge  Niemeyer’s  view,  this  would  violate  other  stu-\n \n \n\n14  \ndents’ “legitimate and important interest in bodily priva-\ncy such that his or her nude or partially nude body, geni-\ntalia, and other private parts are not exposed to persons \nof the opposite biological sex.” Id. at 50a. \nThe Board moved for rehearing en banc, which the \npanel  denied  on  May  31,  2016.  Id.  at  61a–66a.  Judge \nNiemeyer dissented but declined to call for an en banc \npoll, stating that “the momentous nature of the issue de-\nserves an open road to the Supreme Court.” Id. at 65a. \nThe Board then asked for a stay of the Fourth Circuit’s \nmandate pending the filing of a certiorari petition. This, \ntoo, was denied, again over Judge Niemeyer’s dissent. \nId. at 67a–70a. The mandate in No. 15-2056 issued on \nJune 17, 2016. \nD.  The “Dear Colleague” Letter Of May 13, \n2016 \nAfter the Fourth Circuit’s ruling, two federal officials, \nthe Department’s Catherine E. Lhamon and DOJ’s Van-\nita Gupta, quickly issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to \nevery Title IX recipient in the country. Id. at 126a–142a. \nThis document expands on the Ferg-Cadima letter by \nimposing detailed requirements on how schools must ac-\ncommodate students with gender-identity issues, includ-\ning the following edicts:  \n \n•  Every  student  claiming  to  be  transgender \nmust be allowed to access restrooms, locker \nrooms,  shower  facilities,  and  athletic  teams \nconsistent with his or her gender identity. The \nFerg-Cadima letter had hedged this require-\nment by including the word “generally.” App. \n \n \n\n15  \n123a.  The  “Dear  Colleague”  letter  removes \nthe hedge and allows for no exceptions. Id. at \n134a. \n•  A school must allow a student access to the  \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and showers of the \nopposite biological sex after the “student or \nthe student’s parent or guardian, as appropri-\nate” merely notifies the school that the stu-\ndent  will  assert  a  gender  identity  different \nfrom his or her biological sex. App. 130a (em-\nphasis added). No medical or psychological di-\nagnosis or evidence of professional treatment \nneed be provided. Id.   \n•  Non-transgender students who are unwilling \nto use restrooms, locker rooms, or showers at \nthe same time as a classmate of the opposite \nbiological sex may be relegated to a separate, \nindividual-user facility. App. 134a. But a school \ncannot require the transgender student to use \nthat separate, individual-user facility, no mat-\nter how many non-transgender students ob-\nject to the presence of a student of the oppo-\nsite biological sex in restrooms, locker rooms, \nor showers. Id. \nThe letter went out on May 13, 2016, only 24 days af-\nter the Fourth Circuit’s decision. Needless to say, it did \nnot go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe Dear Colleague letter has been challenged by \nover twenty States in two federal lawsuits. See Texas v. \nUnited States of America, No. 7:16-cv-00054 (N.D. Tex. \n \n \n\n16  \nMay 25, 2016); Nebraska v. United States of America, \nNo. 4:16-cv-03117 (D. Neb. July 8, 2016). On August 21, \n2016, a federal district court in Texas issued a nationwide \npreliminary injunction against enforcement of the regu-\nlatory  interpretation  contained  in  the  Dear  Colleague \nletter and in similar guidance documents. See Texas, su-\npra, ECF No. 58; Pet. App. 183a–229a. \nE.  The  Proceedings  After  Remand, \nIncluding No. 16-1733 \nMeanwhile, on remand from the Fourth Circuit, the \ndistrict court promptly entered a preliminary injunction \nwithout giving the Board any notice or opportunity to \nsubmit additional briefing or evidence. App. 71–72a. The \ninjunction orders the Board to permit G.G. to use the \nboys’ restroom at Gloucester High School “until further \norder of this Court.” Id. at 72a. It does not enjoin the \nBoard from enforcing its policy with respect to locker \nrooms and showers—even though the Ferg-Cadima let-\nter, which the Fourth Circuit endorsed as “controlling” \nauthority,  generally  requires  schools  to  allow \ntransgender students to access locker rooms, shower fa-\ncilities, housing, and athletic teams that accord with their \ngender identity. App. 123a. \nThe Board appealed this preliminary-injunction or-\nder, which created a second case in the Fourth Circuit, \nNo. 16-1733. The district court denied the Board’s re-\nquest to stay its injunction pending appeal. App. 73a–\n75a. The Board’s request that the Fourth Circuit stay the \ninjunction pending appeal was also denied, again over \nJudge Niemeyer’s dissent. App. 76a–81a. \n \n \n\n17  \nFinally, the Board asked this Court to recall and stay \nthe Fourth Circuit’s mandate in No. 15-2056, and to stay \nthe district court’s preliminary injunction, pending this \ncertiorari petition. This Court granted the Board’s re-\nquest on August 3, 2016. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. \nG.G., 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016) (per curiam). In this com-\nbined petition, the Board seeks a writ of certiorari as to \nNo. 15-2056, and a writ of certiorari before judgment at \nto No. 16-1733. See S. Ct. R. 12.4. \n   \n \n \n\n18  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Court should grant the petition for three rea-\nsons. First, this case provides an excellent vehicle for re-\nconsidering—and abolishing or refining—the doctrine \nof Auer deference that has recently been questioned by \nseveral Justices. Second, if the Court decides to retain \nAuer, this case provides an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning  important  disagreements  among  the  lower  courts \nabout  Auer’s  proper  application.  Third,  this  case  pro-\nvides an excellent vehicle for determining whether the \nDepartment’s  understanding  of  Title  IX  and  section \n106.33—an understanding it has recently sought to im-\npose upon educational institutions throughout the Na-\ntion—is controlling.     \nI.  THE  COURT  SHOULD  GRANT \nCERTIORARI  TO  RECONSIDER  THE \nDOCTRINE OF AUER DEFERENCE. \nAs to the first reason: The Fourth Circuit did not \neven attempt to show that the Ferg-Cadima letter re-\nflects  the  most  plausible  construction  of  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. Instead, its ruling hinged entirely on Auer def-\nerence—a doctrine that requires courts to enforce an \nagency’s interpretation of its own regulations unless that \ninterpretation is “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with \nthe regulation.” Auer, 519 U.S. at 461 (citation omitted); \nsee also Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. \n410, 414 (1945). Several members of this Court have ex-\npressed interest in revisiting the doctrine of Auer defer-\n \n \n\n19  \nence, which gives agencies enormous power over policy \nissues  of  interest  across  the  political  spectrum.5  This \ncase presents an ideal vehicle for doing so, because the \nissue is fully preserved and because the Fourth Circuit \ndiscussed the Auer framework extensively and regarded \nit as outcome-determinative. App. 15a–24a.6 \nThe problems with Auer deference have been well \nrehearsed. See, e.g., Decker, 133 S. Ct. at 1339–42 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Perez, 135 \nS. Ct. at 1213–25 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judg-\nment); John F. Manning, Constitutional Structure and \nJudicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency \nRules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996); Robert A. Anthony, \nThe Supreme Court and the APA: Sometimes They Just \nDon’t Get It, 10 Admin. L.J. Am. U. 1, 4–12 (1996). Four \nof the most important reasons for this Court to abandon \nor limit the scope of the Auer-deference regime are as \nfollows: \n                                                   \n5  See, e.g., Decker v. Nw. Envtl. Def. Ctr., 133 S. Ct. 1326, 1338–\n39 (2013) (Roberts, C.J., concurring); id. at 1339–42 (Scalia, J., con-\ncurring in part and dissenting in part); Perez v. Mortg. Bankers \nAss’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1210–11 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring in part \nand concurring in the judgment); id. at 1211–13 (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in the judgment); id. at 1213–25 (Thomas, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \n6  By contrast, in Foster v. Vilsack, 820 F.3d 330 (8th Cir. 2016) \n(petition for certiorari pending), the Eighth Circuit’s opinion does \nnot cite or discuss Auer or any Auer-related rulings from this Court. \nIt simply declares, without analysis, that the agency’s “reasonable \ninterpretation” is “owe[d] deference.” Id. at 335. \n \n \n\n20  \nFirst, as this case illustrates, Auer deference effec-\ntively gives an agency the power to invade the province \nof both Congress and the courts in determining federal \nlaw on all kinds of issues of interest to all kinds of con-\nstituencies. See, e.g., Decker, 133 S. Ct. at 1342 (Scalia, \nJ., dissenting) (Auer “contravenes one of the great rules \nof separation of powers [that he] who writes a law must \nnot  adjudge  its  violation.”);  Perez,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1217 \n(Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) (Auer is an un-\nconstitutional “transfer of judicial power to the Execu-\ntive branch,” and “an erosion of the judicial obligation to \nserve  as  a  ‘check’  on  the  political  branches.”);  id.  at \n1210–11 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in \nthe judgment) (noting that “the opinions of Justice Scalia \nand Justice Thomas offer substantial reasons why the \nSeminole Rock doctrine may be incorrect”).  \nHere, in purporting to interpret section 106.33, the \nDepartment effectively changed the meaning of the stat-\nutory term “sex” in Title IX. To be sure, it did so in a \nmanner that furthered the views of the present Admin-\nistration. But that same strategy could easily be adopted \nby a future administration with radically different views. \nIndeed, it could be deployed to effectively amend in a dif-\nferent direction, and without any meaningful judicial re-\nview, not only Title IX, but also other federal statutes \ndealing with matters such as health care, the environ-\nment, labor relations, and financial-services regulation. \nFor those reasons, the type of Auer deference applied by \nthe  Fourth  Circuit  here  raises  serious  separation-of-\npowers problems. See, e.g., Manning, supra, at 631–54.  \n \n \n\n21  \nSecond, the Auer doctrine is poorly formulated. It in-\nstructs courts to enforce an agency’s interpretation of its \nown regulations unless that interpretation is “plainly er-\nroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.” Auer, 519 \nU.S. at 461 (emphasis added). But that disjunctive for-\nmulation leaves substantial ambiguity: The phrase “in-\nconsistent with the regulation” implies de novo rather \nthan deferential review. And it is not apparent how the \n“plainly erroneous” prong of the Auer deference test will \never do any work: Every “plainly erroneous” interpreta-\ntion of a regulation will also be “inconsistent with the \nregulation,” and the disjunctive “or” means that a liti-\ngant challenging the interpretation need only show that \nthe agency’s interpretation fails under the less deferen-\ntial half of this test. This petition presents a prime op-\nportunity for the Court to resolve this ambiguity—even \nif a majority of the Court wishes to retain some form of \nAuer deference. \nThe third problem for the Auer doctrine is the text of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, which plainly states \nthat: \n[T]he reviewing court shall decide all relevant \nquestions of law, interpret constitutional and \nstatutory provisions, and determine the mean-\ning or applicability of the terms of an agency \naction. \n5 U.S.C. § 706 (emphases added). How can this statutory \ncommand be reconciled with a regime that requires the \njudiciary  to  defer  to  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  its \nregulations,  rather  than  “determine  the  meaning”  of \n \n \n\n22  \nthose agency rules for itself? No one thinks the APA’s \ncommand to “interpret constitutional . . . provisions” re-\nquires courts to defer to an agency’s beliefs on what the \nConstitution means. So why do matters suddenly become \ndifferent  when  an  agency  purports  to  “determine  the \nmeaning” of one of its rules? \nTo be sure, some APA provisions require courts to \ndefer to some forms of agency decisionmaking, but those \nprovisions do so in unmistakable language. See, e.g., 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(E) (authorizing courts to set aside agen-\ncy  factfinding  only  when  “unsupported  by  substantial \nevidence”); Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. \n474 (1951) (holding that section 706(2)(E) requires defer-\nential judicial review of agency factfinding). In contrast \nto those provisions, the APA’s straightforward instruc-\ntion that courts “decide all relevant questions of law” and \n“determine the meaning . . . of an agency action” leaves \nthe Auer doctrine in a precarious position. The APA tells \nthe courts to “determine the meaning” of an agency’s \nrules, but Auer tells the agency to “determine the mean-\ning” of its rules so long as it stays within the boundaries \nof reasonableness.  \nThe opinion in Seminole Rock said nothing about how \nits ostensible deference regime might be reconciled with \nthe text of the APA, see 325 U.S. 410, but it had good \nreason for that omission: the APA had not been enacted \nyet. So the Seminole Rock Court can be forgiven for fail-\ning to explain how its deference concept can co-exist with \nsection 706 of the APA. It is harder to justify the post-\nSeminole Rock decisions that reflexively followed this \npre-APA decision without acknowledging the intervening \n \n \n\n23  \nstatute  or  attempting  to  explain  how  Seminole  Rock \ncould survive the APA.7 \nNor can Auer be defended on the ground that Chev-\nron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), likewise ignored section 706 of \nthe APA. This Court eventually supplied a rationale for \nChevron that comports with the APA: Influenced heavily \nby Justice Breyer’s scholarship,8 the Court held in Unit-\ned States v. Mead Corp. that Chevron can apply only \nwhen Congress affirmatively intends to delegate inter-\npretive or gap-filling authority to an agency. See 533 U.S. \n218,  229–34  (2001).  After  Mead,  a  court  that  applies \nChevron is not “deferring” to an agency’s interpretation \nof a statute. Rather, it is interpreting the statute de novo, \nand asking whether Congress intended to authorize the \nagency to act within certain statutory boundaries. If the \nanswer is “yes,” the statute means that the agency gets \nto  decide  and  that  reviewing  courts  must  respect  the \nagency’s decision. Mead enables Chevron to co-exist with \n                                                   \n7  See, e.g., Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16–17 (1965); Thorpe v. \nHous. Auth. of City of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 276 (1969). \n8  See Stephen Breyer, Judicial Review of Questions of Law and \nPolicy, 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363 (1986); id. at 373 (criticizing notion \nthat Chevron should apply to all agency interpretations of law as \n“seriously  overbroad,  counterproductive  and  sometimes  sense-\nless.”); Cass R. Sunstein, Chevron Step Zero, 92 Va. L. Rev. 187 \n(2006) (explaining how Justice Breyer’s views influenced this Court’s \nrulings in Christensen, Mead and Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 \n(2002)). \n \n \n\n24  \nsection 706 of the APA. No such rationale has ever been \nprovided for Auer.  \nThis leads to the fourth problem with Auer defer-\nence: It cannot be sustained in its current form after this \nCourt’s decisions in Christensen, Mead, and Barnhart v. \nWalton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002). In pre-Mead days, when the \nChevron framework established a blanket presumption \nthat agencies rather than courts would fill gaps and re-\nsolve ambiguities in statutory language, Auer deference \ncould be defended as Chevron’s logical corollary. If an \nagency’s interpretive rules or informal correspondence \nwould receive Chevron deference when courts interpret \nfederal statutes, it was reasonable to accord those docu-\nments  equal  weight  when  interpreting  agency  regula-\ntions—which, after all, have the same force and effect as \na federal statute. \nAuer  became  much  harder  to  defend  after  Mead, \nwhich  withholds  Chevron  deference  from  interpretive \nrules and other agency correspondence that never went \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking. For example, \nhow can a document like the Ferg-Cadima letter receive \nnothing more than Skidmore deference when interpret-\ning a statute,9 but trigger much higher deference as soon \nas it purports to interpret an agency regulation? And if \nthe Ferg-Cadima letter is entitled to Chevron-like defer-\nence when it purports to interpret 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, \nwhy doesn’t that make it into a substantive rule that car-\n                                                   \n9  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 229–34; Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587. \n \n \n\n25  \nries the force of law and therefore must go through no-\ntice and comment? See 5 U.S.C. § 553.  \nIn short, Mead established symmetry between the \nChevron–Skidmore  divide  and  the  distinction  between \nsubstantive and interpretive rules. “Interpretive rules” \nneed not go through notice and comment because they \nlack the force of law, but for this reason cannot receive \nChevron deference. To confer Chevron deference upon \nsuch interpretive rules would give them the force of law, \nthereby triggering section 553’s notice-and-comment re-\nquirements. But Auer deference throws a wrench into \nthis  perfectly  crafted  arrangement,  by  allowing  such \nthings as the Ferg-Cadima letter to receive the force of \nlaw  even  though  they  never  went  through  notice  and \ncomment. If nothing else, the Court should grant certio-\nrari to align the Auer-deference regime with the post-\nMead Chevron regime. That alone would require revers-\ning the Fourth Circuit’s decision.  \nII.  THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nTO  RESOLVE  DISAGREEMENTS  AMONG \nTHE  LOWER  COURTS  OVER  WHEN  THE \nAUER-DEFERENCE  FRAMEWORK,  IF  IT \nSURVIVES, SHOULD BE APPLIED. \nAssuming Auer survives, this case also presents an \nopportunity for the Court to resolve serious disagree-\nments among the lower courts on the proper application \nof Auer deference. As explained below, there currently \nexists a serious circuit conflict on the question whether \nAuer deference can apply at all to informal agency pro-\nnouncements. There is also deep disagreement among \n \n \n\n26  \nthe circuits about whether Auer deference can apply to \nagency positions that—like the Ferg-Cadima letter—\nare developed in the context of the very dispute in which \ndeference is sought. And the Texas district court’s recent \ndecision to enjoin the Department’s efforts to impose its \ninterpretation on schools throughout the Nation both ex-\nacerbates the conflict and illustrates the urgent need for \nthis Court to resolve the questions presented here.  \nA.  The Fourth Circuit’s Decision To Extend \nAuer  Deference  To  The  Ferg-Cadima \nLetter Conflicts With Rulings From The \nFirst, Seventh, And Eleventh Circuits. \nAs noted, the Ferg-Cadima letter did not go through \nnotice and comment, and it is about as informal an agen-\ncy document as one can imagine. The letter was not pub-\nlicized; there is no evidence it was approved by the head \nof an agency; and it was signed only by a relatively low-\nlevel  federal  functionary,  an  Acting  Deputy  Assistant \nSecretary for Policy. The Fourth Circuit did not think \nany of this mattered; it was enough that the Department \nwas willing to stand by the letter in the federal amicus \nbrief. App. 16a–17a. But a letter such as this would not \nhave received Auer deference in the First, Seventh or \nEleventh Circuits.  \nFor  example,  the  First  Circuit’s  ruling  in  United \nStates v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004), re-\nfused to extend Auer deference to non-public or informal \nagency interpretations—and it linked Auer deference to \nthe same formality requirements that trigger Chevron \ndeference under Mead:  \n \n \n\n27  \n[A]gency  interpretations  are  only  relevant  if \nthey  are  reflected  in  public  documents. . . . \n[U]nder  Chevron,  the  Supreme  Court  has \nmade  clear  that  informal  agency  interpreta-\ntions of statutes, even if public, are not entitled \nto  deference.  See  generally  United  States  v. \nMead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001). While this is \nnot a situation involving the interpretation of a \nstatute, the same requirements of public acces-\nsibility  and  formality  are  applicable  in  the \ncontext  of  agency  interpretations  of  regula-\ntions. . . .  The  non-public  or  informal  under-\nstandings  of  agency  officials  concerning  the \nmeaning of a regulation are thus not relevant. \n387 F.3d at 54 (emphasis added).  \nThe Seventh Circuit has likewise held that it will not \nextend Auer deference to informal agency pronounce-\nments such as the Ferg-Cadima letter. In Keys v. Barn-\nhart, 347 F.3d 990 (7th Cir. 2003), that court explained \nthat Christensen and Mead have curtailed the scope of \nAuer deference, limiting it to agency pronouncements \nthat carry the “force of law” and that would qualify for \ndeference under Chevron if they were purporting to in-\nterpret statutes:  \nAuer  . . .  gave  full  Chevron  deference  to  an \nagency’s amicus curiae brief; yet in the Chris-\ntensen  case  the  Supreme  Court  stated  flatly \nthat “interpretations such as those in opinion \nletters—like interpretations contained in poli-\ncy statements, agency manuals, and enforce-\n \n \n\n28  \nment guidelines, all of which lack the force of \nlaw—do  not  warrant  Chevron-style  defer-\nence.” . . . Briefs certainly don’t have “the force \nof law.” . . . \nProbably there is little left of Auer. The theory \nof Chevron is that Congress delegates to agen-\ncies the power to make law to fill gaps in stat-\nutes. See, e.g., United States v. Mead Corp., \nsupra, 533 U.S. at 226–27. . . . It is odd to think \nof agencies as making law by means of state-\nments made in briefs, since agency briefs, at \nleast below the Supreme Court level, normally \nare not reviewed by the members of the agency \nitself; and it is odd to think of Congress dele-\ngating  lawmaking  power  to  unreviewed  staff \ndecisions. \n347 F.3d at 993–94 (Posner, J.). And in U.S. Freightways \nCorp. v. Commissioner, 270 F.3d 1137 (7th Cir. 2001), the \nSeventh Circuit applied Skidmore rather than Auer to \nthe  IRS  Commissioner’s  interpretation  of  his  regula-\ntions,  because  “the  interpretive  methodologies  he  has \nused have been informal.” Id. at 1141–42.  \nLikewise, the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Arriaga \nv.  Florida  Pacific  Farms,  L.L.C.,  305  F.3d  1228,  1238 \n(11th Cir. 2002), applied Skidmore rather than Auer to \nagency  opinion  letters  that  purport  to  interpret  the \nagency’s regulations. \nAgainst  the  First,  Seventh,  and  Eleventh  Circuits \nstand the Fourth Circuit as well as other courts of ap-\npeals that have found the lack of procedural formality \n \n \n\n29  \nirrelevant  to  whether  the  Auer-deference  framework \nshould apply—even after this Court’s decisions in Chris-\ntensen and Mead. See, e.g., Cordiano v. Metacon Gun \nClub, Inc., 575 F.3d 199, 207–08 (2nd Cir. 2009) (holding \nthat “agency interpretations that lack the force of law,” \nwhile not warranting deference when interpreting am-\nbiguous statutes, “do normally warrant deference when \nthey  interpret  ambiguous  regulations”);  Encarnacion \nex. rel George v. Astrue, 568 F.3d 72, 78 (2nd Cir. 2009) \n(holding agency’s interpretation is entitled to Auer def-\nerence “regardless of the formality of the procedures \nused  to  formulate  it”)  (quotation  omitted);  Bassiri  v. \nXerox Corp., 463 F.3d 927, 930 (9th Cir. 2006) (granting \nAuer deference to agency interpretation “even if [adopt-\ned] through an informal process” that “is not reached \nthrough the normal notice-and-comment procedure” and \nthat “does not have the force of law”); Smith v. Nichol-\nson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (affording Seminole \nRock deference “even when [the agency’s interpretation] \nis offered in informal rulings such as in a litigating doc-\nument”).  \nIt appears the circuits are currently divided 4-3 on \nwhether an agency’s regulatory interpretation produced \nthrough informal processes can qualify for Auer defer-\nence after Christensen and Mead. The Fourth Circuit’s \ndecision here directly implicates this circuit split, and it \nis ripe for this Court’s review. \n \n \n\n30  \nB.  The  Fourth  Circuit’s  Decision  To  Extend \nAuer Deference To The Ferg-Cadima Letter \nIs In Substantial Tension With Decisions In \nThe Ninth And Federal Circuits.  \nAnother relevant feature of the Ferg-Cadima letter is \nthat it was issued solely in response to G.G.’s dispute \nwith the Board. Days after the Board passed its resolu-\ntion of December 9, 2014, a transgender activist e-mailed \nthe Department and solicited the letter, specifically with \nrespect to the Board’s policy. App. 118a–120a. But this \nfact was of no moment to the Fourth Circuit, which held \nthat Auer deference should apply even if the agency had \nnever before expressed these views apart from G.G.’s \ndispute with Board. App. 17a. The Fourth Circuit had \ncompany in reaching this conclusion: At least four other \ncourts of appeals agree that Auer deference should apply \neven when the agency adopts its interpretation solely in \nthe context of the dispute before the court.10 \n                                                   \n10  Intracomm, Inc. v. Bajaj, 492 F.3d 285, 293 & n.6 (4th Cir. 2007) \n(deferring to Secretary’s interpretation advanced in case under re-\nview); Woudenberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 794 F.3d 595, 599, 601 \n(6th Cir. 2015) (deferring to agency ruling in the case under review); \nBible ex rel. Proposed Class v. United Student Aid Funds, Inc., 799 \nF.3d 633, 639, 651 (7th Cir. 2015) (deferring to agency’s interpreta-\ntion advanced in amicus briefs), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1607 (2016); \nBiodiversity Conservation All. v. Jiron, 762 F.3d 1036, 1062–68 \n(10th Cir. 2014) (deferring to agency interpretation advanced during \nadministrative appeal); Polycarpe v. E&S Landscaping Serv. Inc., \n616 F.3d 1217, 1225 (11th Cir. 2010) (deferring to agency interpreta-\ntion advanced in amicus brief). \n \n \n\n31  \nBut opinions from the Ninth Circuit and the Federal \nCircuit have refused to extend Auer deference in similar \nsituations. In Vietnam Veterans of America v. CIA, 811 \nF.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2015), the Ninth Circuit refused to \napply  Auer  deference  to  an  interpretation  of  agency \nrules that was “ ‘developed . . . only in the context of this \nlitigation.’ ” Id. at 1078. And in Massachusetts Mutual \nLife Insurance Co. v. United States, 782 F.3d 1354 (Fed. \nCir. 2015), the Federal Circuit refused to apply the Auer \nframework to an IRS interpretation that was “advanced \nfor the first time in litigation.” Id. at 1369–70. So the \nFourth Circuit’s ruling implicates yet another division \namong the courts of appeals, and the Court should grant \ncertiorari to resolve it.11 \nC.  The Nationwide Federal Injunction Decision \nFrom Texas Also Conflicts With The Fourth \nCircuit’s Approach.  \nThe lower courts are also divided over whether Auer \ndeference should extend to the specific agency interpre-\ntations at issue in this case. Eight days ago, on August \n21, 2016, a federal district court in Texas refused to ex-\n                                                   \n11  To be sure, the Fourth Circuit’s decision to invoke Auer defer-\nence in the circumstances presented here was also wrong for a host \nof other reasons, see Application for Stay, No. 16A52, at 18–29, in-\ncluding this Court’s reminder in Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 \n(2006), that Auer deference is inappropriate where that pronounce-\nment “cannot be considered an interpretation of the regulation” as \nopposed to the underlying statute. Id. at 247. As discussed, the \nFerg-Cadima letter offered an interpretation of Title IX itself, and \nnot merely the regulation. See supra at 11. \n \n \n\n32  \ntend  Auer  deference  to  the  Department’s  bathroom, \nlocker room and shower edicts, finding that 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 unambiguously allows Title IX recipients to es-\ntablish separate facilities on the basis of biological sex. \nSee Texas v. United States of America, Case No. 7:16-cv-\n00054, ECF No. 58; Pet. App. 183a–229a. That decision is \nsignificant here for two distinct reasons.  \nFirst, as a practical matter, it exacerbates the exist-\ning conflicts and disagreements over the proper applica-\ntion of Auer deference and Title IX to transgender indi-\nviduals. Indeed, given that decision, and based on com-\npeting views of Auer, schools in one section of the Na-\ntion—states within the Fourth Circuit—are now bound \nby the Department’s view of Title IX, while at the same \ntime the Department is currently prohibited from even \nattempting to impose that same view on schools in the \nrest of the Nation.  \nSecond, the Texas decision highlights the urgent, na-\ntionwide importance of the issues presented in this peti-\ntion. Every recipient of Title IX funds throughout the \nNation—ranging  from  universities  to  elementary \nschools—is now being substantially affected by the dis-\nagreement among the lower courts about the proper ap-\nplication of Auer deference. That is an additional reason \nfor this court’s review, especially given the deep disa-\ngreements that already exist over whether Auer defer-\nence  should  extend  to  agency  documents  such  as  the \nFerg-Cadima letter. \n \n \n\n33  \nIII.  THE  COURT  SHOULD  GRANT \nCERTIORARI  TO  CONSIDER  WHETHER \nTHE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION \nOF  TITLE  IX  AND  34  C.F.R.  § 106.33  IS \nBINDING. \nFinally, granting this petition will give the Court an \nexcellent opportunity to determine whether the Depart-\nment’s specific interpretation of Title IX is binding. In \nfact, that interpretation is flatly wrong and therefore, \nunder any reasonable view of Auer, is not legally binding \non anyone.  \n1.  Nothing in Title IX’s text or structure supports \nthe foundational premise of the Ferg-Cadima letter—\nnamely, that the proscription of discrimination “on the \nbasis of sex . . . includ[es] gender identity.” App. 121a. \nThe term “gender identity” is nowhere in Title IX. Con-\ngress knows how to legislate protection against gender \nidentity discrimination: it has done so elsewhere, but not \nin Title IX.12 Conversely, numerous bills have attempted \nto introduce the concept of gender identity into federal \nlaws, but failed.13 The interpretive alchemy of deeming \n                                                   \n12   See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A) (prohibiting discrimination \nbased on “sex, gender identity …, sexual orientation, or disability”); \n42 U.S.C. § 3796gg (assisting victims “whose ability to access tradi-\ntional services and responses is affected by their … gender identi-\nty”). \n13   See, e.g., H.R. 2015 (110th Cong. 2007); H.R. 3017 (111th Cong. \n2009); S. 1584 (111th Cong. 2009); H.R. 1397 (112th Cong. 2011); S. \n811 (112th Cong. 2011); H.R. 1755 (113th Cong. 2013); S. 815 (113th \nCong.  2013)  (unenacted  versions  of  Employment  Non-\n(continued…) \n \n \n\n34  \n“sex” to include “gender identity” would revise those leg-\nislative defeats into victories. That is not how statutory \ninterpretation works. See, e.g., Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. \nColl., __ F.3d __, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 13746, at *7 & \nn.2 (7th Cir. July 28, 2016) (noting, “despite multiple ef-\nforts, Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation that \nwould have extended Title VII to cover sexual orienta-\ntion”). \nTo the contrary, when federal law deploys the term \n“sex” in anti-discrimination statutes, it prohibits discrim-\nination based on “nothing more than male and female, \nunder the traditional binary conception of sex consistent \nwith one’s birth or biological sex.” Johnston v. Univ. of \nPittsburgh, 97 F.Supp.3d 657, 676 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (citing \nEtsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1222 (10th \nCir. 2007). As Judge Niemeyer’s dissent explained, dur-\ning the period when Title IX was enacted and its regula-\ntions promulgated, “virtually every dictionary definition \nof ‘sex’ referred to the physiological distinctions between \nmales and females, particularly with respect to their re-\nproductive functions.” App. 54a (collecting definitions). \nIn other words, the prohibition on “sex” discrimination in \nlaws like Title IX and Title VII “do[es] not outlaw dis-\ncrimination against . . . a person born with a male body \nwho believes himself to be a female, or a person born \nwith a female body who believes herself to be a male.” \n                                                                                                        \nDiscrimination Act, which would have prohibited gender identity \ndiscrimination). \n \n \n\n35  \nUlane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. \n1984).  \n2.  Moreover, reading “sex” to include “gender iden-\ntity” would make a hash of Title IX’s scheme allowing \nfacilities  and  programs  to  be  separated  by  “sex.”14  If \n“sex” signifies, not biology, but rather one’s “internal” \nsense of maleness or femaleness, the whole concept of \npermissible sex-separation collapses. What sense could \nthere be in allowing “separate living facilities for the dif-\nferent sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, if a biological male could \nlegally qualify as a woman based merely on his subjec-\ntive perception of being one? The answer is none. Cf. \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n. 19 (1996) \n(admitting women to VMI “would undoubtedly require \nalterations necessary to afford members of each sex pri-\nvacy from the other sex in living arrangements”). \n3.  Nor is the Ferg-Cadima interpretation supported \nby the theory of sex-stereotyping discrimination in Price \nWaterhouse  v.  Hopkins,  490  U.S.  228  (1989).  Cf.  App. \n122a n.2 (relying on Price Waterhouse). A Price Water-\nhouse claim is “based on behaviors, mannerisms, and ap-\npearances,” such as when a male employee is fired be-\ncause he “wear[s] jewelry . . . considered too effeminate, \n                                                   \n14   See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1686 (allowing “separate living facilities for \nthe different sexes”); 34 C.F.R. § 106.32 (allowing “separate housing \non the basis of sex,” provided facilities are “[p]roportionate in quan-\ntity” and “comparable in quality and cost”); 34 C.F.R. § 106.34 (al-\nlowing “separation of students by sex” within physical education \nclasses and certain sports “the purpose or major activity of which \ninvolves bodily contact”). \n \n \n\n36  \ncarr[ies] a serving tray too gracefully, or tak[es] too ac-\ntive a role in child rearing.” Johnston, 97 F.Supp.3d at \n680 (internal quotations and citation omitted). But Price \nWaterhouse does not require “employers to allow biolog-\nical males to use women’s restrooms,” because “[u]se of a \nrestroom designated for the opposite sex does not consti-\ntute a mere failure to conform to sex stereotypes.” Etsit-\nty, 502 F.3d at 1224. If anything, the Board’s policy is the \nopposite of sex stereotyping: it designates male and fe-\nmale  restrooms  based  solely  on  biology,  regardless  of \nwhether a man or a woman satisfies some stereotypical \nnotion of masculinity or femininity. See, e.g., Johnston, \n97 F.Supp.3d at 680–81 (rejecting sex stereotyping claim \non this basis).  \n4.  Furthermore,  an  interpretation  of  Title  IX  ac-\ncording to the Ferg-Cadima view would render the stat-\nute unconstitutional, and must be avoided for that reason \nalone. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 190 (1991) \n(describing constitutional avoidance canon). For instance, \nit would cause Title IX to violate the Spending Clause by \nfailing to give “clear notice” of conditions attached to \nfederal funding.15 No funding recipient could have had \n“clear notice” of the novel interpretation of Title IX in \n                                                   \n15   Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 297 \n(2006) (clear notice absent where text “does not even hint” fees due \nto prevailing party); NFIB v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2606 (2012) \n(Congress’s spending clause power “does not include surprising par-\nticipating  States  with  post-acceptance  or  retroactive  conditions” \n(quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 25 \n(1981)).   \n \n \n\n37  \nthis case. Indeed, the G.G. majority confirmed as much \nby finding the Title IX regulation was ambiguous as ap-\nplied to transgender individuals. App. 18a. Cf. Bennett v. \nKy. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 666 (1985) (no “clear \nnotice” violation where there was “no ambiguity with re-\nspect to” funding condition). \n5.  Finally, taking the Ferg-Cadima letter’s construc-\ntion of “sex” seriously would turn Title IX against itself. \nAs the district court pointed out, the relevant regulation \nwould bar the Board’s policy only if “sex” means solely \n“gender identity” and excludes any notion of “biological \nsex.” App. 99a–102a. As applied to Title IX, that prepos-\nterous construction would legalize just the kind of biolog-\nically based discrimination against men and women that \nTitle IX was enacted to prevent. For instance, schools \ncould exclude biological women from taking science clas-\nses or joining the chess team, so long as they allowed \nbiological men who identify as females to do so. Only \ntransgendered people would be protected under this Ti-\ntle IX regime; men and women who identify with their \nbiological sex would receive no protection at all. \nIndeed, if “sex” means only “gender identity,” the \nBoard’s policy would not implicate Title IX at all because \nit addresses only “biological sex” and excludes consider-\nation of gender identity. But that is absurd: everyone \nagrees  that  the  Title  IX  regulation  squarely  address-\nes—and  expressly  allows—sex-separated  restrooms, \nexactly like the ones provided by the Board’s policy.  \n \n \n\n38  \nCONCLUSION \nSome regard transgender restroom access as one of \nthe great civil-rights issues of our time. But that makes \nit all the more important to insist that federal officials \nfollow the procedures for lawmaking prescribed in the \nConstitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. To \ncondone the agency behavior displayed in this case is to \ncondone future use of these maneuvers by other agency \nofficials, and in support of other causes—without any \nway of ensuring that the Executive Branch will always \nbe controlled by people who share one’s most deeply held \nbeliefs. \nAt bottom, then, this case is not really about whether \nG.G. should be allowed to access the boys’ restrooms, nor \neven primarily about whether Title IX can be interpret-\ned to require recipients to allow transgender students \ninto the restrooms and locker rooms that accord with \ntheir gender identity. Fundamentally, this case is about \nwhether an agency employee can impose that policy in a \npiece of private correspondence. If the Court looks the \nother way, then the agency officials in this case—and in \na host of others to come—will have become a law unto \nthemselves.  \n \n \n\n39  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be grant-\ned.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nJONATHAN F.

After G.G. began to use the \nboys’ restrooms with the approval of the school admin-\nistration, the local school board passed a policy banning \nG.G.  from  the  boys’  restroom.  G.G.  alleges  that  the \nschool board impermissibly discriminated against him in \nviolation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Constitution. The district court dismissed G.G.’s Title \nIX claim and denied his request for a preliminary injunc-\ntion. This appeal followed. Because we conclude the dis-\ntrict court did not accord appropriate deference to the \nrelevant Department of Education regulations, we re-\nverse its dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim. Because we \nconclude that the district court used the wrong eviden-\ntiary standard in assessing G.G.’s motion for a prelimi-\nnary injunction, we vacate its denial and remand for con-\nsideration under the correct standard. We therefore re-\nverse in part, vacate in part, and remand the case for \nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \n\n8a \n \nI. \nAt the heart of this appeal is whether Title IX re-\nquires schools to provide transgender students access to \nrestrooms congruent with their gender identity. Title IX \nprovides: “[n]o person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assis-\ntance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). The Department of Educa-\ntion’s (the Department) regulations implementing Title \nIX permit the provision of “separate toilet, locker room, \nand shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facili-\nties provided for students of one sex shall be comparable \nto such facilities for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. In an opinion letter dated January 7, 2015, the \nDepartment’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) interpreted \nhow this regulation should apply to transgender individ-\nuals: “When a school elects to separate or treat students \ndifferently on the basis of sex . . . a school generally must \ntreat transgender students consistent with their gender \nidentity.” J.A. 55. Because this case comes to us after \ndismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the facts below are generally as stated in G.G.’s \ncomplaint.  \n \nA. \nG.G. is a transgender boy now in his junior year at \nGloucester High School. G.G.’s birth-assigned sex, or so-\ncalled “biological sex,” is female, but G.G.’s gender iden-\ntity is male. G.G. has been diagnosed with gender dys-\nphoria,  a  medical  condition  characterized  by  clinically \nsignificant distress caused by an incongruence between a \nperson’s gender identity and the person’s birth-assigned \n\n9a \n \nsex. Since the end of his freshman year, G.G. has under-\ngone hormone therapy and has legally changed his name \nto G., a traditionally male name. G.G. lives all aspects of \nhis life as a boy. G.G. has not, however, had sex reas-\nsignment surgery.1 \nBefore beginning his sophomore year, G.G. and his \nmother told school officials that G.G. was a transgender \nboy. The officials were supportive and took steps to en-\nsure that he would be treated as a boy by teachers and \nstaff.  Later,  at  G.G.’s  request,  school  officials  allowed \nG.G. to use the boys’ restroom.2 G.G. used this restroom \nwithout incident for about seven weeks. G.G.’s use of the \nboys’ restroom, however, excited the interest of others in \nthe community, some of whom contacted the Gloucester \nCounty School Board (the Board) seeking to bar G.G. \nfrom continuing to use the boys’ restroom.  \nBoard Member Carla B. Hook (Hook) added an item \nto the agenda for the November 11, 2014 board meeting \ntitled  “Discussion  of  Use  of  Restrooms/Locker  Room \nFacilities.” J.A. 15. Hook proposed the following resolu-\ntion (hereinafter the “transgender restroom policy” or \n“the policy”):  \n                                                   \n1  The  World  Professional  Association  for  Transgender  Health \n(WPATH) has established Standards of Care for individuals with \ngender dysphoria. J.A. 37. These Standards of Care are accepted as \nauthoritative by organizations such as the American Medical Asso-\nciation  and  the  American  Psychological  Association.  Id.  The \nWPATH Standards of Care do not permit sex reassignment surgery \nfor persons who are under the legal age of majority. J.A. 38. \n2 G.G. does not participate in the school’s physical education pro-\ngrams. He does not seek here, and never has sought, use of the boys’ \nlocker room. Only restroom use is at issue in this case. \n\n10a \n \nWhereas  the  GCPS  [i.e.,  Gloucester  County \nPublic Schools] recognizes that some students \nquestion their gender identities, and  \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students \nto  seek  support,  advice,  and  guidance  from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, \nand  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide \nmale and female restroom and locker room fa-\ncilities in its schools, and the use of said facili-\nties shall be limited to the corresponding bio-\nlogical genders, and students with gender iden-\ntity issues shall be provided an alternative ap-\npropriate private facility.  \nJ.A. 15–16; 58.(cid:2) \nAt  the  November  11,  2014  meeting  twenty-seven \npeople  spoke  during  the  Citizens’  Comment  Period,  a \nmajority of whom supported Hook’s proposed resolution. \nMany of the speakers displayed hostility to G.G., includ-\ning by referring pointedly to him as a “young lady.” J.A. \n16. Others claimed that permitting G.G. to use the boys’ \nrestroom would violate the privacy of other students and \nwould lead to sexual assault in restrooms. One comment-\ner suggested that if the proposed policy were not adopt-\ned, non-transgender boys would come to school wearing \ndresses in order to gain access to the girls’ restrooms. \nG.G. and his parents spoke against the proposed policy. \nUltimately, the Board postponed a vote on the policy un-\ntil its next meeting on December 9, 2014.  \n\n11a \n \nAt the December 9 meeting, approximately thirty-\nseven people spoke during the Citizens’ Comment Peri-\nod. Again, most of those who spoke were in favor of the \nproposed resolution. Some speakers threatened to vote \nthe Board members out of office if the Board members \nvoted against the proposed policy. Speakers again re-\nferred to G.G. as a “girl” or “young lady.” J.A. 18. One \nspeaker called G.G. a “freak” and compared him to a \nperson who thinks he is a “dog” and wants to urinate on \nfire hydrants. Id. Following this second comment period, \nthe Board voted 6-1 to adopt the proposed policy, there-\nby barring G.G. from using the boys’ restroom at school.  \nG.G. alleges that he cannot use the girls’ restroom \nbecause women and girls in those facilities “react[] nega-\ntively because they perceive[] G.G. to be a boy.” Id. Fur-\nther, using the girls’ restroom would “cause severe psy-\nchological distress” to G.G. and would be incompatible \nwith his treatment for gender dysphoria. J.A. 19. As a \ncorollary to the policy, the Board announced a series of \nupdates  to  the  school’s  restrooms  to  improve  general \nprivacy for all students, including adding or expanding \npartitions  between  urinals  in  male  restrooms,  adding \nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and \nconstructing single-stall unisex restrooms available to all \nstudents. G.G. alleges that he cannot use these new uni-\nsex restrooms because they “make him feel even more \nstigmatized . . . . Being required to use the separate rest-\nrooms sets him apart from his peers, and serves as a dai-\nly reminder that the school views him as ‘different.’ ” Id. \nG.G. further alleges that, because of this stigma and ex-\nclusion, his social transition is undermined and he expe-\nriences  “severe  and  persistent  emotional  and  social \nharms.”  Id.  G.G.  avoids  using  the  restroom  while  at \n\n12a \n \nschool and has, as a result of this avoidance, developed \nmultiple urinary tract infections.  \n \nB. \nG.G. sued the Board on June 11, 2015. G.G. seeks an \ninjunction allowing him to use the boys’ restroom and \nbrings underlying claims that the Board impermissibly \ndiscriminated against him in violation of Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 and the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Constitution. On July 27, 2015, the \ndistrict court held a hearing on G.G.’s motion for a pre-\nliminary injunction and on the Board’s motion to dismiss \nG.G.’s lawsuit. At the hearing, the district court orally \ndismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim and denied his request \nfor a preliminary injunction, but withheld ruling on the \nmotion to dismiss G.G.’s equal protection claim. The dis-\ntrict court followed its ruling from the bench with a writ-\nten order dated September 4, 2015 denying the injunc-\ntion  and  a  second  written  order  dated  September  17, \n2015 dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and expanding on \nits rationale for denying the injunction.  \nIn its September 17, 2015 order, the district court \nreasoned that Title IX prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of sex and not on the basis of other concepts such \nas gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The \ndistrict court observed that the regulations implement-\ning Title IX specifically allow schools to provide separate \nrestrooms on the basis of sex. The district court conclud-\ned that G.G.’s sex was female and that requiring him to \nuse the female restroom facilities did not impermissibly \ndiscriminate against him on the basis of sex in violation \nof Title IX. With respect to G.G.’s request for an injunc-\ntion, the district court found that G.G. had not made the \n\n13a \n \nrequired showing that the balance of equities was in his \nfavor. The district court found that requiring G.G. to use \nthe unisex restrooms during the pendency of this lawsuit \nwas  not  unduly  burdensome  and  would  result  in  less \nhardship than requiring other students made uncomfort-\nable by G.G.’s presence in the boys’ restroom to them-\nselves use the unisex restrooms.  \nThis appeal followed. G.G. asks us to reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s dismissal of his Title IX claim, grant the in-\njunction he seeks, and, because of comments made by \nthe district judge during the motion hearing, to assign \nthe case to a different district judge on remand. The \nBoard, on the other hand, asks us to affirm the district \ncourt’s rulings and also asks us to dismiss G.G.’s equal \nprotection claim—on which the district court has yet to \nrule—as without merit. The United States, as it did be-\nlow, has filed an amicus brief supporting G.G.’s Title IX \nclaim in order to defend the government’s interpretation \nof Title IX as requiring schools to provide transgender \nstudents access to restrooms congruent with their gen-\nder identity.  \n \nII. \nWe turn first to the district court’s dismissal of G.G.’s \nTitle IX claim.3 We review de novo the district court’s \n                                                   \n3 We decline the Board’s invitation to preemptively dismiss G.G.’s \nequal protection claim before it has been fully considered by the dis-\ntrict court. “[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.” Decker v. \nNw. Envtl. Def. Ctr., 133 S. Ct. 1326, 1335 (2013) (citation and quota-\ntion marks omitted). We will not proceed to the merits of G.G.’s \nequal protection claim on appeal without the benefit of the district \ncourt’s prior consideration. \n\n14a \n \ngrant of a motion to dismiss. Cruz v. Maypa, 773 F.3d \n138, 143 (4th Cir. 2014). “To survive a motion to dismiss, \na complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, ac-\ncepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citations and quotations omitted). \nAs noted earlier, Title IX provides: “[n]o person . . . \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimi-\nnation under any education program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). To al-\nlege a violation of Title IX, G.G. must allege (1) that he \nwas excluded from participation in an education program \nbecause of his sex; (2) that the educational institution \nwas receiving federal financial assistance at the time of \nhis exclusion; and (3) that the improper discrimination \ncaused G.G. harm.4 See Preston v. Virginia ex rel. New \n                                                   \n4 The Board suggests that a restroom may not be educational in na-\nture and thus is not an educational program covered by Title IX. \nAppellee’s Br. 35 (quoting Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 97 F. \nSupp. 3d 657, 682 (W.D. Pa. 2015)). The Department’s regulation \npertaining to “Education programs or activities” provides:  \nExcept as provided in this subpart, in providing any aid, \nbenefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on \nthe basis of sex:  \n(1) Treat one person differently from another in deter-\nmining whether such person satisfies any requirement \nor condition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or ser-\nvice;  \n(2) Provide different aid, benefits, or services or provide \naid, benefits, or services in a different manner;  \n(3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service;  \nContinued … \n\n15a \n \nRiver Cmty. Coll., 31 F.3d 203, 206 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing \nCannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 680 (1979)). We \nlook to case law interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 for guidance in evaluating a claim brought \nunder Title IX. Jennings v. Univ. of N.C., 482 F.3d 686, \n695 (4th Cir. 2007).  \nNot all distinctions on the basis of sex are impermis-\nsible under Title IX. For example, Title IX permits the \nprovision of separate living facilities on the basis of sex: \n“nothing contained [in Title IX] shall be construed to \nprohibit any educational institution receiving funds un-\nder this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities \nfor the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. The Depart-\nment’s  regulations  implementing  Title  IX  permit  the \nprovision of “separate toilet, locker room, and shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided \nfor students of one sex shall be comparable to such facili-\nties provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. The Department recently delineated how this \nregulation should be applied to transgender individuals. \nIn an opinion letter dated January 7, 2015, the Depart-\nment’s  Office  for  Civil  Rights  (OCR)  wrote:  “When  a \nschool elects to separate or treat students differently on \n                                                                                                        \n. . . \n(7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any \nright, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b). We have little difficulty concluding that access \nto a restroom at a school, under this regulation, can be considered \neither an “aid, benefit, or service” or a “right, privilege, advantage, \nor opportunity,” which, when offered by a recipient institution, falls \nwithin the meaning of “educational program” as used in Title IX and \ndefined by the Department’s implementing regulations. \n\n16a \n \nthe  basis  of  sex  . . .  a  school  generally  must  treat \ntransgender students consistent with their gender iden-\ntity.”5 J.A. 55.  \nG.G., and the United States as amicus curiae, ask us \nto give the Department’s interpretation of its own regu-\nlation controlling weight pursuant to Auer v. Robbins, \n519 U.S. 452 (1997). Auer requires that an agency’s in-\n                                                   \n5 The opinion letter cites to OCR’s December 2014 “Questions and \nAnswers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary \nClasses and Extracurricular Activities.” This document, denoted a \n“significant  guidance  document”  per  Office  of  Management  and \nBudget  regulations,  states:  “All  students,  including  transgender \nstudents and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are \nprotected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title \nIX, a recipient generally must treat transgender students consistent \nwith their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementa-\ntion, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes.” \nOffice of Civil Rights, Dept. of Educ., Questions and Answers on \nTitle IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and \nExtracurricular  Activities  25  (2014)  available        at   \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/faqs-title-ix-single-sex \n-201412.pdf. \nThe dissent suggests that we ignore the part of OCR’s opinion letter \nin which the agency “also encourages schools to offer the use of gen-\nder-neutral, individual-user facilities to any student who does not \nwant to use shared sex-segregated facilities,” as the Board did here. \nPost at 66. However, because G.G. does want to use shared sex-\nsegregated facilities, the agency’s suggestion regarding students \nwho do not want to use such shared sex-segregated facilities is im-\nmaterial to the resolution of G.G.’s claim. Nothing in today’s opinion \nrestricts any school’s ability to provide individual-user facilities.  \n \n \n \n\n17a \n \nterpretation of its own ambiguous regulation be given \ncontrolling weight unless the interpretation is plainly er-\nroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or statute. \nId.  at  461.  Agency  interpretations  need  not  be  well-\nsettled or long-standing to be entitled to deference. They \nmust, however, “reflect the agency’s fair and considered \njudgment on the matter in question.” Id. at 462. An in-\nterpretation may not be the result of the agency’s fair \nand considered judgment, and will not be accorded Auer \ndeference, when the interpretation conflicts with a prior \ninterpretation, when it appears that the interpretation is \nno more than a convenient litigating position, or when \nthe interpretation is a post hoc rationalization. Christo-\npher v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 132 S. Ct. 2156, 2166 \n(2012) (citations omitted).  \nThe district court declined to afford deference to the \nDepartment’s interpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. The \ndistrict court found the regulation to be unambiguous \nbecause  “[i]t  clearly  allows  the  School  Board  to  limit \nbathroom access ‘on the basis of sex,’ including birth or \nbiological  sex.”  G.G.  v.  Gloucester  Cty.  Sch.  Bd.,  No. \n4:15cv54, 2015 WL 5560190, at *8 (E.D. Va. Sept. 17, \n2015). The district court also found, alternatively, that \nthe  interpretation  advanced  by  the  Department  was \nclearly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation. \nThe district court reasoned that, because “on the basis of \nsex” means, at most, on the basis of sex and gender to-\ngether, it cannot mean on the basis of gender alone. Id.  \nThe United States contends that the regulation clari-\nfies  statutory  ambiguity  by  making  clear  that  schools \nmay  provide  separate  restrooms  for  boys  and  girls \n“without running afoul of Title IX.” Br. for the United \nStates as Amicus Curiae 24–25 (hereinafter “U.S. Br.”). \n\n18a \n \nHowever, the Department also considers § 106.33 itself \nto be ambiguous as to transgender students because “the \nregulation is silent on what the phrases ‘students of one \nsex’ and ‘students of the other sex’ mean in the context of \ntransgender students.” Id. at 25. The United States con-\ntends that the interpretation contained in OCR’s Janu-\nary 7, 2015 letter resolves the ambiguity in § 106.33 as \nthat regulation applies to transgender individuals.  \n \nB. \nWe will not accord an agency’s interpretation of an \nunambiguous regulation Auer deference. Thus, our anal-\nysis begins with a determination of whether 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 contains an ambiguity. Section 106.33 permits \nschools  to  provide  “separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities \nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to \nsuch facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.33.  \n“[D]etermining  whether  a  regulation  or  statute  is \nambiguous presents a legal question, which we deter-\nmine de novo.” Humanoids Grp. v. Rogan, 375 F.3d 301, \n306 (4th Cir. 2004). We determine ambiguity by analyz-\ning  the  language  under  the  three-part  framework  set \nforth in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997). \nThe plainness or ambiguity of language is determined by \nreference to (1) the language itself, (2) the specific con-\ntext in which that language is used, and (3) the broader \ncontext of the statute or regulation as a whole. Id. at 341.  \nFirst,  we  have  little  difficulty  concluding  that  the \nlanguage itself—“of one sex” and “of the other sex”—\nrefers to male and female students. Second, in the specif-\nic context of § 106.33, the plain meaning of the regulatory \n\n19a \n \nlanguage is best stated by the United States: “the mere \nact of providing separate restroom facilities for males \nand females does not violate Title IX . . . .” U.S. Br. 22 \nn.8. Third, the language “of one sex” and “of the other \nsex”  appears  repeatedly  in  the  broader  context  of  34 \nC.F.R. § 106 Subpart D, titled “Discrimination on the \nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohib-\nited.”6  This  repeated  formulation  indicates  two  sexes \n(“one sex” and “the other sex”), and the only reasonable \nreading of the language used throughout the relevant \nregulatory section is that it references male and female. \nRead plainly then, § 106.33 permits schools to provide \nseparate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities for its \nmale and female students. By implication, the regulation \nalso permits schools to exclude males from the female \nfacilities and vice-versa.  \nOur inquiry is not ended, however, by this straight-\nforward conclusion. Although the regulation may refer \nunambiguously to males and females, it is silent as to \nhow a school should determine whether a transgender \nindividual is a male or female for the purpose of access to \n                                                   \n6 For example, § 106.32(b)(2) provides that “[h]ousing provided . . . \nto students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students \nof the other sex, shall be as a whole: proportionate in quantity . . . \nand [c]omparable in quality and cost to the student”; § 106.37(a)(3) \nprovides that an institution generally cannot “[a]pply any rule . . . \nconcerning eligibility [for financial assistance] which treats persons \nof one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to \nmarital or parental status”; and § 106.41(b) provides that “where [an \ninstitution] operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for \nmembers of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for \nmembers of the other sex . . . members of the excluded sex must be \nallowed to try-out for the team offered . . . .”  \n\n20a \n \nsex-segregated restrooms. We conclude that the regula-\ntion is susceptible to more than one plausible reading be-\ncause it permits both the Board’s reading—determining \nmaleness  or  femaleness  with  reference  exclusively  to \ngenitalia—and  the  Department’s  interpretation—\ndetermining maleness or femaleness with reference to \ngender identity. Cf. Dickenson-Russell Coal Co. v. Sec’y \nof Labor, 747 F.3d 251, 258 (4th Cir. 2014) (refusing to \nafford Auer deference where the language of the regula-\ntion at issue was “not susceptible to more than one plau-\nsible reading” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). It \nis not clear to us how the regulation would apply in a \nnumber of situations—even under the Board’s own “bio-\nlogical  gender”  formulation.  For  example,  which  rest-\nroom would a transgender individual who had undergone \nsex-reassignment surgery use? What about an intersex \nindividual? What about an individual born with X-X-Y \nsex chromosomes? What about an individual who lost ex-\nternal genitalia in an accident? The Department’s inter-\npretation  resolves  ambiguity  by  providing  that  in  the \ncase of a transgender individual using a sex-segregated \nfacility, the individual’s sex as male or female is to be \ngenerally determined by reference to the student’s gen-\nder identity.  \n \nC. \nBecause we conclude that the regulation is ambigu-\nous as applied to transgender individuals, the Depart-\nment’s interpretation is entitled to Auer deference un-\nless the Board demonstrates that the interpretation is \nplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or \nstatute. Auer, 519 U.S. at 461. “Our review of the agen-\ncy’s interpretation in this context is therefore highly def-\n\n21a \n \nerential.” Dickenson-Russell Coal, 747 F.3d at 257 (cita-\ntion and quotation marks omitted). “It is well established \nthat an agency’s interpretation need not be the only pos-\nsible reading of a regulation—or even the best one—to \nprevail.” Decker v. Nw. Envtl. Def. Ctr., 133 S. Ct. 1326, \n1337 (2013). An agency’s view need only be reasonable to \nwarrant deference. Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., \n501  U.S.  680,  702  (1991)  (“[I]t  is  axiomatic  that  the \n[agency’s] interpretation need not be the best or most \nnatural one by grammatical or other standards. Rather, \nthe [agency’s] view need be only reasonable to warrant \ndeference.”).  \nTitle IX regulations were promulgated by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1975 and \nwere adopted unchanged by the Department in 1980. 45 \nFed. Reg. 30802, 30955 (May 9, 1980). Two dictionaries \nfrom the drafting era inform our analysis of how the \nterm “sex” was understood at that time. The first defines \n“sex” as “the character of being either male or female” \nor “the sum of those anatomical and physiological differ-\nences with reference to which the male and female are \ndistinguished . . . .” American College Dictionary 1109 \n(1970). The second defines “sex” as:  \nthe  sum  of  the  morphological,  physiological, \nand  behavioral  peculiarities  of  living  beings \nthat subserves biparental reproduction with its \nconcomitant genetic segregation and recombi-\nnation  which  underlie  most  evolutionary \nchange, that in its typical dichotomous occur-\nrence is usu[ally] genetically controlled and as-\nsociated  with  special  sex  chromosomes,  and \nthat  is  typically  manifested  as  maleness  and \nfemaleness . . . .  \n\n22a \n \nWebster’s  Third  New  International  Dictionary  2081 \n(1971). \nAlthough  these  definitions  suggest  that  the  word \n“sex”  was  understood  at  the  time  the  regulation  was \nadopted to connote male and female and that maleness \nand femaleness were determined primarily by reference \nto the factors the district court termed “biological sex,” \nnamely reproductive organs, the definitions also suggest \nthat a hard-and-fast binary division on the basis of re-\nproductive organs—although useful in most cases—was \nnot universally descriptive.7 The dictionaries, therefore, \nused qualifiers such as reference to the “sum of” various \nfactors, “typical dichotomous occurrence,” and “typical-\nly  manifested  as  maleness  and  femaleness.”  Section \n106.33 assumes a student population composed of indi-\nviduals of what has traditionally been understood as the \nusual  “dichotomous  occurrence”  of  male  and  female \nwhere the various indicators of sex all point in the same \ndirection. It sheds little light on how exactly to deter-\nmine  the  “character  of  being  either  male  or  female” \nwhere  those  indicators  diverge.  We  conclude  that  the \nDepartment’s interpretation of how § 106.33 and its un-\nderlying assumptions should apply to transgender indi-\nviduals is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the \n                                                   \n7 Modern definitions of “sex” also implicitly recognize the limitations \nof a nonmalleable, binary conception of sex. For example, Black’s \nLaw Dictionary defines “sex” as “[t]he sum of the peculiarities of \nstructure and function that distinguish a male from a female organ-\nism; gender.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1583 (10th ed. 2014). The \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary includes in the definition of “sex” \n“[o]ne’s identity as either female or male.” American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011). \n\n23a \n \ntext of the regulation. The regulation is silent as to which \nrestroom  transgender  individuals  are  to  use  when  a \nschool elects to provide sex-segregated restrooms, and \nthe Department’s interpretation, although perhaps not \nthe intuitive one, is permitted by the varying physical, \npsychological, and social aspects—or, in the words of an \nolder dictionary, “the morphological, physiological, and \nbehavioral peculiarities”—included in the term “sex.”  \n \nD. \nFinally,    we    consider    whether    the    Depart-\nment’s  interpretation  of  §  106.33  is  the  result  of  the \nagency’s fair and considered judgment. Even a valid in-\nterpretation will not be accorded Auer deference where \nit conflicts with a prior interpretation, where it appears \nthat the interpretation is no more than a convenient liti-\ngating position, or where the interpretation is a post hoc \nrationalization. Christopher, 132 S. Ct. at 2166 (citations \nomitted). \nAlthough  the  Department’s  interpretation  is  novel \nbecause there was no interpretation as to how § 106.33 \napplied to transgender individuals before January 2015, \n“novelty alone is no reason to refuse deference” and does \nnot render the current interpretation inconsistent with \nprior agency practice. See Talk Am., Inc. v. Mich. Bell \nTel.  Co.,  131  S.  Ct.  2254,  2263  (2011).  As  the  United \nStates explains, the issue in this case “did not arise until \nrecently,” see id., because schools have only recently be-\ngun citing § 106.33 as justification for enacting new poli-\ncies restricting transgender students’ access to restroom \nfacilities. The Department contends that “[i]t is to those \n‘newfound’ policies that [the Department’s] interpreta-\ntion of the regulation responds.” U.S. Br. 29. We see no \n\n24a \n \nreason to doubt this explanation. See Talk Am., Inc., 131 \nS. Ct. at 2264.  \nNor is the interpretation merely a convenient litigat-\ning position. The Department has consistently enforced \nthis position since 2014. See J.A. 55 n.5 & n.6 (providing \nexamples  of  OCR  enforcement  actions  to  secure \ntransgender  students  access  to  restrooms  congruent \nwith their gender identities). Finally, this interpretation \ncannot properly be considered a post hoc rationalization \nbecause it is in line with the existing guidances and regu-\nlations of a number of federal agencies—all of which \nprovide that transgender individuals should be permit-\nted access to the restroom that corresponds with their \ngender identities.8 U.S. Br. 17 n.5 & n.6 (citing publica-\ntions by the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-\ntion, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nthe  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development, \nand the Office of Personnel Management). None of the \nChristopher grounds for withholding Auer deference are \npresent in this case.  \n                                                   \n8 We disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that the result we reach \ntoday renders the enforcement of separate restroom facilities im-\npossible because it “would require schools to assume gender identity \nbased on appearances, social expectations, or explicit declarations of \nidentity.” Post at 65. Accepting the Board’s position would equally \nrequire the school to assume “biological sex” based on “appearances, \nsocial expectations, or explicit declarations of [biological sex].” Cer-\ntainly, no one is suggesting mandatory verification of the “correct” \ngenitalia before admittance to a restroom. The Department’s vision \nof sex-segregated restrooms which takes account of gender identity \npresents no greater “impossibility of enforcement” problem than \ndoes the Board’s “biological gender” vision of sex-segregated rest-\nrooms. \n\n25a \n \n \nE. \nWe conclude that the Department’s interpretation of \nits own regulation, § 106.33, as it relates to restroom ac-\ncess by transgender individuals, is entitled to Auer def-\nerence and is to be accorded controlling weight in this \ncase.9 We reverse the district court’s contrary conclusion \nand its resultant dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.  \n \nF. \nIn many respects, we are in agreement with the dis-\nsent. We agree that “sex” should be construed uniformly \nthroughout Title IX and its implementing regulations. \nWe  agree  that  it  has  indeed  been  commonplace  and \nwidely  accepted  to  separate  public  restrooms,  locker \nrooms,  and  shower  facilities  on  the  basis  of  sex.  We \nagree that “an individual has a legitimate and important \ninterest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude or \npartially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts” \nare not involuntarily exposed.10 Post at 56. It is not ap-\n                                                   \n9 The Board urges us to reach a contrary conclusion regarding the \nvalidity of the Department’s interpretation, citing Johnston v. Univ. \nof Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 657 (W.D. \nPa. 2015). Although we recognize that the Johnston court confront-\ned a case similar in most material facts to the one before us, that \ncourt did not consider the Department’s interpretation of § 106.33. \nBecause the Johnston court did not grapple with the questions of \nadministrative law implicated here, we find the Title IX analysis in \nJohnston to be unpersuasive.  \n10 We doubt that G.G.’s use of the communal restroom of his choice \nthreatens the type of constitutional abuses present in the cases cited \nby the dissent. For example, G.G.’s use—or for that matter any in-\ndividual’s appropriate use—of a restroom will not involve the type \nContinued … \n\n26a \n \nparent to us, however, that the truth of these proposi-\ntions undermines the conclusion we reach regarding the \nlevel of deference due to the Department’s interpretation \nof its own regulations.  \nThe Supreme Court commands the use of particular \nanalytical frameworks when courts review the actions of \nthe executive agencies. G.G. claims that he is entitled to \nuse the boys’ restroom pursuant to the Department’s in-\nterpretation of its regulations implementing Title IX. We \nhave carefully followed the Supreme Court’s guidance in \nChevron, Auer, and Christopher and have determined \nthat the interpretation contained in the OCR letter is to \nbe accorded controlling weight. In a case such as this, \nwhere there is no constitutional challenge to the regula-\ntion or agency interpretation, the weighing of privacy \ninterests or safety concerns11—fundamentally questions \n                                                                                                        \nof intrusion present in Brannum v. Overton Cty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d \n489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (involving the videotaping of students dress-\ning and undressing in school locker rooms), Beard v. Whitmore \nLake Sch. Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) (involving the in-\ndiscriminate strip searching of twenty male and five female stu-\ndents), or Supelveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(involving a male parole officer forcibly entering a bathroom stall \nwith a female parolee to supervise the provision of a urine sample). \n11 The dissent accepts the Board’s invocation of amorphous safety \nconcerns as a reason for refusing deference to the Department’s \ninterpretation. We note that the record is devoid of any evidence \ntending to show that G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom creates a safe-\nty issue. We also note that the Board has been, perhaps deliberately, \nvague as to the nature of the safety concerns it has—whether it \nfears that it cannot ensure G.G.’s safety while in the restroom or \nwhether it fears G.G. himself is a threat to the safety of others in the \nrestroom. We are unconvinced of the existence of danger caused by \n“sexual responses prompted by students’ exposure to the private \nContinued … \n\n27a \n \nof policy—is a task committed to the agency, not to the \ncourts.  \nThe Supreme Court’s admonition in Chevron points \nto the balance courts must strike:  \nJudges are not experts in the field, and are not \npart of either political branch of the Govern-\nment.  Courts  must,  in  some  cases,  reconcile \ncompeting political interests, but not on the ba-\nsis of the judges’ personal policy preferences. \nIn contrast, an agency to which Congress has \ndelegated  policy-making  responsibilities  may, \nwithin the limits of that delegation, properly \nrely upon the incumbent administration’s views \nof wise policy to inform its judgments. While \nagencies  are  not  directly  accountable  to  the \npeople, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely \nappropriate  for  this  political  branch  of  the \nGovernment  to  make  such  policy  choices—\nresolving the competing interests which Con-\ngress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, \nor intentionally left to be resolved by the agen-\ncy charged with the administration of the stat-\nute in light of everyday realities.  \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 \nU.S. 837, 865–66 (1984). Not only may a subsequent ad-\n                                                                                                        \nbody parts of students of the other biological sex.” Post at 58. The \nsame safety concern would seem to require segregated restrooms \nfor gay boys and girls who would, under the dissent’s formulation, \npresent a safety risk because of the “sexual responses prompted” by \ntheir exposure to the private body parts of other students of the \nsame sex in sex-segregated restrooms. \n\n28a \n \nministration choose to implement a different policy, but \nCongress may also, of course, revise Title IX explicitly to \nprohibit or authorize the course charted here by the De-\npartment regarding the use of restrooms by transgender \nstudents. To the extent the dissent critiques the result \nwe reach today on policy grounds, we reply that, our Au-\ner analysis complete, we leave policy formulation to the \npolitical branches.  \n \nIII. \nG.G. also asks us to reverse the district court’s denial \nof the preliminary injunction he sought which would have \nallowed him to use the boys’ restroom during the pen-\ndency of this lawsuit. “To win such a preliminary injunc-\ntion, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they are likely \nto succeed on the merits; (2) they will likely suffer irrep-\narable  harm  absent  an  injunction;  (3)  the  balance  of \nhardships weighs in their favor; and (4) the injunction is \nin the public interest.” League of Women Voters of N.C. \nv. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236 (4th Cir. 2014) (cita-\ntion omitted). We review a district court’s denial of a pre-\nliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. Id. at 235. “A \ndistrict court has abused its discretion if its decision is \nguided  by  erroneous  legal  principles  or  rests  upon  a \nclearly erroneous factual finding.” Morris v. Wachovia \nSec., Inc., 448 F.3d 268, 277 (4th Cir. 2006) (citation and \nquotations omitted). “We do not ask whether we would \nhave come to the same conclusion as the district court if \nwe  were  examining  the  matter  de  novo.”  Id.  (citation \nomitted). Instead, “we reverse for abuse of discretion if \nwe form a definite and firm conviction that the court be-\nlow committed a clear error of judgment in the conclu-\n\n29a \n \nsion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.” \nId. (citations and quotations omitted).  \nThe district court analyzed G.G.’s request only with \nreference  to  the  third  factor—the  balance  of  hard-\nships—and found that the balance of hardships did not \nweigh in G.G.’s favor. G.G. submitted two declarations in \nsupport of his complaint, one from G.G. himself and one \nfrom a medical expert, Dr. Randi Ettner, to explain what \nharms G.G. will suffer as a result of his exclusion from \nthe boys’ restroom. The district court refused to consider \nthis evidence because it was “replete with inadmissible \nevidence including thoughts of others, hearsay, and sup-\npositions.” G.G., 2015 WL 5560190, at *11.  \nThe district court misstated the evidentiary standard \ngoverning preliminary injunction hearings. The district \ncourt stated: “The complaint is no longer the deciding \nfactor, admissible evidence is the deciding factor. Evi-\ndence therefore must conform to the rules of evidence.” \nId. at *9. Preliminary injunctions, however, are governed \nby less strict rules of evidence:  \nThe  purpose  of  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nmerely to preserve the relative positions of the \nparties until a trial on the merits can be held. \nGiven this limited purpose, and given the haste \nthat is often necessary if those positions are to \nbe preserved, a preliminary injunction is cus-\ntomarily  granted  on  the  basis  of  procedures \nthat are less formal and evidence that is less \ncomplete than in a trial on the merits.  \nUniv. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); see \nalso Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 (1976) (taking \nas  true  the  “well-pleaded  allegations  of  respondents’ \ncomplaint and uncontroverted affidavits filed in support \n\n30a \n \nof  the  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction”);  compare \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56 (requiring affidavits supporting sum-\nmary judgment to be “made on personal knowledge, [and \nto] set out facts that would be admissible in evidence), \nwith Fed R. Civ. P. 65 (providing no such requirement in \nthe preliminary injunction context). Thus, although ad-\nmissible evidence may be more persuasive than inadmis-\nsible evidence in the preliminary injunction context, it \nwas  error  for  the  district  court  to  summarily  reject \nG.G.’s proffered evidence because it may have been in-\nadmissible at a subsequent trial.  \nAdditionally, the district court completely excluded \nsome of G.G.’s proffered evidence on hearsay grounds. \nThe seven of our sister circuits to have considered the \nadmissibility of hearsay in preliminary injunction pro-\nceedings  have  decided  that  the  nature  of  evidence  as \nhearsay goes to “weight, not preclusion” and have per-\nmitted district courts to “rely on hearsay evidence for \nthe limited purpose of determining whether to award a \npreliminary injunction.” Mullins v. City of New York, \n626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Kos Pharm., Inc. \nv. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 718 (3d Cir. 2004); Ty, Inc. \nv. GMA Accessories, Inc., 132 F.3d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir. \n1997); Levi Strauss & Co. v. Sunrise Int’l Trading, Inc., \n51 F.3d 982, 985 (11th Cir. 1995) (“At the preliminary in-\njunction stage, a district court may rely on affidavits and \nhearsay  materials  which  would  not  be  admissible  evi-\ndence for a permanent injunction, if the evidence is ap-\npropriate given the character and objectives of the in-\njunctive  proceeding.”  (citation  and  internal  quotations \nomitted)); Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. FDIC, 992 \nF.2d 545, 551 (5th Cir. 1993) (“[A]t the preliminary in-\njunction stage, the procedures in the district court are \n\n31a \n \nless formal, and the district court may rely on otherwise \ninadmissible evidence, including hearsay evidence.”); As-\nseo v. Pan Am. Grain Co., Inc., 805 F.2d 23, 26 (1st Cir. \n1986); Flynt Distrib. Co., Inc. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389, \n1394 (9th Cir. 1984). We see no reason for a different \nrule to govern in this Circuit. Because preliminary in-\njunction proceedings are informal ones designed to pre-\nvent irreparable harm before a later trial governed by \nthe  full  rigor  of  usual  evidentiary  standards,  district \ncourts may look to, and indeed in appropriate circum-\nstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible evidence \nwhen deciding whether a preliminary injunction is war-\nranted. \nBecause the district court evaluated G.G.’s proffered \nevidence against a stricter evidentiary standard than is \nwarranted by the nature and purpose of preliminary in-\njunction proceedings to prevent irreparable harm before \na full trial on the merits, the district court was “guided \nby  erroneous  legal  principles.”  We  therefore  conclude \nthat the district court abused its discretion when it de-\nnied G.G.’s request for a preliminary injunction without \nconsidering G.G.’s proffered evidence. We vacate the dis-\ntrict court’s denial of G.G.’s motion for a preliminary in-\njunction and remand the case to the district court for \nconsideration of G.G.’s evidence in light of the eviden-\ntiary standards set forth herein.  \n \nIV. \nFinally, G.G. requests that we reassign this case to a \ndifferent district judge on remand. G.G. does not explicit-\nly claim that the district judge is biased. Absent such a \nclaim, reassignment is only appropriate in “unusual cir-\ncumstances where both for the judge’s sake and the ap-\n\n32a \n \npearance of justice an assignment to a different judge is \nsalutary and in the public interest, especially as it mini-\nmizes even a suspicion of partiality.” United States v. \nGuglielmi, 929 F.2d 1001, 1007 (4th Cir. 1991) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). In determining \nwhether such circumstances exist, a court should consid-\ner: (1) whether the original judge would reasonably be \nexpected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in \nputting out of his or her mind previously expressed views \nor findings determined to be erroneous or based on evi-\ndence that must be rejected, (2) whether reassignment is \nadvisable to preserve the appearance of justice, and (3) \nwhether reassignment would entail waste and duplica-\ntion out of proportion to any gain in preserving the ap-\npearance of fairness. Id. (citation omitted).  \nG.G. argues that both the first and second Guglielmi \nfactors are satisfied. He contends that the district court \nhas pre-existing views which it would be unwilling to put \naside in the face of contrary evidence about medical sci-\nence generally and about “gender and sexuality in par-\nticular.” Appellant’s Br. 53. For example, the court ac-\ncepted the Board’s concern by noting:  \nThere are only two instincts—two. Everything \nelse  is  acquired—everything.  That  is,  the \nbrain only has two instincts. One is called self-\npreservation, and the other is procreation. And \nprocreation is the highest instinct in individuals \nwho  are  in  the  latter  part  of  their  teen-age \nyears. All of that is accepted by all medical sci-\nence, as far as I can determine in reading in-\nformation.  \nJ.A. 85–86. \n\n33a \n \nThe  district  court  also  expressed  skepticism  that \nmedical science supported the proposition that one could \ndevelop a urinary tract infection from withholding urine \nfor too long. J.A. 111–12. The district court characterized \ngender dysphoria as a “mental disorder” and resisted \nseveral attempts by counsel for G.G. to clarify that it on-\nly becomes a disorder when left untreated. See J.A. 88–\n91; 101–02. The district court also seemed to reject G.G.’s \nrepresentation of what it meant to be transgender, re-\npeatedly noting that G.G. “wants” to be a boy and not a \ngirl, but that “he is biologically a female.” J.A. 103–04; \nsee also J.A. 104 (“It’s his mind. It’s not physical that \ncauses that, it’s what he believes.”). The district court’s \nmemorandum opinion, however, included none of the ex-\ntraneous remarks or suppositions that marred the hear-\ning.  \nReassignment is an unusual step at this early stage of \nlitigation. Although the district court did express opin-\nions about medical facts and skepticism of G.G.’s claims, \nthe  record  does  not  clearly  indicate  that  the  district \njudge would refuse to consider and credit sound contrary \nevidence. Further, although the district court has a dis-\ntinct way of proceeding in court, the hearing record and \nthe district court’s written order in the case do not raise \nin our minds a question about the fundamental fairness \nof the proceedings, however idiosyncratic. The conduct \nof the district judge does not at this point satisfy the \nGuglielmi standard. We deny G.G.’s request for reas-\nsignment to a different district judge on remand. \n \nV. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the dis-\ntrict court is  \n\n34a \n \n \nREVERSED  IN  PART,  VACATED  IN \nPART, AND REMANDED. \n \nDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring:(cid:2) \nI concur in Judge Floyd’s fine opinion. I write sepa-\nrately, however, to note that while I am happy to join in \nthe remand of this matter to the district court so that it \nmay consider G.G.’s evidence under proper legal stand-\nards in the first instance, this Court would be on sound \nground in granting the requested preliminary injunction \non the undisputed facts in the record.  \n \nI. \nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction, G.G. must \ndemonstrate that (1) he is likely to succeed on the merits, \n(2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof an injunction, (3) the balance of hardships tips in his \nfavor, and (4) the requested injunction is in the public \ninterest. Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 320 (4th Cir. \n2013) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n20 (2008)). The record before us establishes that G.G. has \ndone so.  \n \nA. \nG.G. alleges that by singling him out for different \ntreatment because he is transgender, the Board’s rest-\nroom policy discriminates against him “on the basis of \nsex” in violation of Title IX. In light of the weight of cir-\ncuit  authority  concluding  that  discrimination  against \ntransgender  individuals  constitutes  discrimination  “on \nthe basis of sex” in the context of analogous statutes and \nour holding here that the Department’s interpretation of \n\n35a \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 is to be given controlling weight, G.G. \nhas surely demonstrated a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of his Title IX claim. See Price Waterhouse v. \nHopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250–51 (1989); see also Glenn v. \nBrumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316–19 (11th Cir. 2011); Smith \nv. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 573–75 (6th Cir. 2004); \nRosa v. Park W. Bank & Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215–16 \n(1st  Cir.  2000);  Schwenk  v.  Hartford,  204  F.3d  1187, \n1201–02 (9th Cir. 2000).  \n \nB. \nIn  support  of  his  claim  of  irreparable  harm,  G.G. \nsubmitted an affidavit to the district court describing the \npsychological distress he experiences when he is forced \nto use the single-stall restrooms or the restroom in the \nnurse’s office. See J.A. 32–33. His affidavit also indicates \nthat he has “repeatedly developed painful urinary tract \ninfections” as a result of holding his urine in order to \navoid using the restroom at school. Id.  \nAn expert declaration by Dr. Randi Ettner, a psy-\nchologist specializing in working with children and ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria, provides further support \nfor G.G.’s claim of irreparable harm. In her affidavit, Dr. \nEttner indicates that treating a transgender boy as male \nin some situations but not in others is “inconsistent with \nevidence-based medical practice and detrimental to the \nhealth and well-being of the child” and explains why ac-\ncess to a restroom appropriate to one’s gender identity is \nimportant for transgender youth. J.A. 39. With respect \nto G.G. in particular, Dr. Ettner states that in her pro-\nfessional opinion, the Board’s restroom policy “is cur-\nrently causing emotional distress to an extremely vul-\nnerable youth and placing G.G. at risk for accruing life-\n\n36a \n \nlong psychological harm.” J.A. 41. In particular, Dr. Ett-\nner opines that  \n[a]s  a  result  of  the  School  Board’s  restroom \npolicy, . . . G.G. is put in the humiliating posi-\ntion of having to use a separate facility, there-\nby  accentuating  his  ‘otherness,’  undermining \nhis identity formation, and impeding his medi-\ncally necessary social transition process. The \nshame of being singled out and stigmatized in \nhis daily life every time he needs to use the \nrestroom  is  a  devastating  blow  to  G.G.  and \nplaces him at extreme risk for immediate and \nlong-term psychological harm.  \nJ.A. 42. \nThe Board offers nothing to contradict any of the as-\nsertions  concerning  irreparable  harm  in  G.G.’s  or  Dr. \nEttner’s affidavits. Instead, its arguments focus on what \nis purportedly lacking from G.G.’s presentation in sup-\nport of his claim of irreparable harm, such as “evidence \nthat  [his  feelings  of  dysphoria,  anxiety,  and  distress] \nwould be lessened by using the boy[s’] restroom,” evi-\ndence from his treating psychologist, medical evidence, \nand an opinion from Dr. Ettner “differentiating between \nthe distress that G.G. may suffer by not using the boy[s’] \nbathroom during the course of this litigation and the dis-\ntress that he has apparently been living with since age \n12.” Br. Appellee 42–43. As to the alleged deficiency con-\ncerning Dr. Ettner’s opinion, the Board’s argument is \nbelied by Dr. Ettner’s affidavit itself, which, as quoted \nabove,  provides  her  opinion  about  the  psychological \nharm  that  G.G.  is  experiencing  “[a]s  a  result  of  the \nSchool Board’s restroom policy.” J.A. 42. With respect to \nthe other purported inadequacies, the absence of such \n\n37a \n \nevidence does nothing to undermine the uncontroverted \nstatements concerning the daily psychological harm G.G. \nexperiences as a result of the Board’s policy or Dr. Ett-\nner’s  unchallenged  opinion  concerning  the  significant \nlong-term  consequences  of  that  harm.  Moreover,  the \nBoard offers no argument to counter G.G.’s averment \nthat he has repeatedly contracted a urinary tract infec-\ntion as a result of holding his urine to avoid using the \nrestroom at school.  \nThe  uncontroverted  facts  before  the  district  court \ndemonstrate that as a result of the Board’s restroom pol-\nicy, G.G. experiences daily psychological harm that puts \nhim at risk for long-term psychological harm, and his \navoidance of the restroom as a result of the Board’s poli-\ncy puts him at risk for developing a urinary tract infec-\ntion  as  he  has  repeatedly  in  the  past.  G.G.  has  thus \ndemonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of an injunction.  \n \nC. \nTurning  to  the  balance  of  the  hardships,  G.G.  has \nshown that he will suffer irreparable harm without the \nrequested injunction. On the other end of the scale, the \nBoard contends that other students’ constitutional right \nto privacy will be imperiled by G.G.’s presence in the \nboys’ restroom.  \nAs the majority opinion points out, G.G.’s use of the \nrestroom does not implicate the unconstitutional actions \ninvolved in the cases cited by the dissent. Moreover, stu-\ndents’ unintentional exposure of their genitals to others \nusing the restroom has already been largely, if not en-\ntirely, remedied by the alterations to the school’s rest-\nrooms already undertaken by the Board. To the extent \n\n38a \n \nthat a student simply objects to using the restroom in \nthe presence of a transgender student even where there \nis no possibility that either student’s genitals will be ex-\nposed, all students have access to the single-stall rest-\nrooms. For other students, using the single-stall rest-\nrooms carries no stigma whatsoever, whereas for G.G., \nusing those same restrooms is tantamount to humiliation \nand a continuing mark of difference among his fellow \nstudents. The minimal or non-existent hardship to other \nstudents of using the single-stall restrooms if they object \nto G.G.’s presence in the communal restroom thus does \nnot tip the scale in the Board’s favor. The balance of \nhardships weighs heavily toward G.G.  \n \nD. \nFinally, consideration of the public interest in grant-\ning  or  denying  the  preliminary  injunction  favors  G.G. \nHaving concluded that G.G. has demonstrated a likeli-\nhood of success on the merits of his Title IX claim, deny-\ning the requested injunction would permit the Board to \ncontinue violating G.G.’s rights under Title IX for the \npendency of this case. Enforcing G.G.’s right to be free \nfrom discrimination on the basis of sex in an educational \ninstitution is plainly in the public interest. Cf. Giovani \nCarandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. \n2002) (citation omitted) (observing that upholding consti-\ntutional rights is in the public interest).  \nThe Board contends that the public interest lies in al-\nlowing this issue to be determined by the legislature, cit-\ning pending legislation before Congress addressing the \nissue  before  the  Court.  But,  as  discussed  above,  the \nweight of authority establishes that discrimination based \non transgender status is already prohibited by the lan-\n\n39a \n \nguage of federal civil rights statutes, as interpreted by \nthe Supreme Court. The existence of proposed legisla-\ntion that, if passed, would address the question before us \ndoes not justify forcing G.G. to suffer irreparable harm \nwhen he has demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits of his claims under current federal law.  \n \nII. \nBased on the evidence presented to the district court, \nG.G. has satisfied all four prongs of the preliminary in-\njunction inquiry. When the record before us supports \nentry  of  a  preliminary  injunction—as  it  amply  does \nhere—we have not hesitated to act to prevent irrepara-\nble injury to a litigant before us. See, e.g., League of \nWomen Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, \n248 (4th Cir. 2014) (expressly observing that appellate \ncourts have the power to vacate a denial of a preliminary \ninjunction and direct entry of an injunction); Eisenberg \nex rel. Eisenberg v. Montgomery Cty. Pub. Schs., 197 \nF.3d 123, 134 (4th Cir. 1999) (directing entry of injunc-\ntion “because the record clearly establishes the plaintiff’s \nright to an injunction and [an evidentiary] hearing would \nnot have altered the result”).  \nNevertheless, it is right and proper that we defer to \nthe district court in this instance. It is to be hoped that \nthe district court will turn its attention to this matter \nwith the urgency the case poses. Under the circumstanc-\nes  here,  the  appropriateness  and  necessity  of  such \nprompt action is plain. By the time the district court is-\nsues its decision, G.G. will have suffered the psychologi-\ncal harm the injunction sought to prevent for an entire \nschool year.  \n\n40a \n \nWith these additional observations, I concur fully in \nJudge Floyd’s thoughtful and thorough opinion for the \npanel.  \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dis-\nsenting in part:  \n \nI concur in Part IV of the court’s opinion. With re-\nspect to whether G.G. stated a claim under Title IX and \nwhether the district court abused its discretion in deny-\ning G.G’s motion for a preliminary injunction, I would \naffirm the ruling of the district court dismissing G.G.’s \nTitle IX claim and denying his motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. I therefore dissent from the majority’s deci-\nsion on those issues.  \nG.G., a transgender boy who is 16, challenges as dis-\ncriminatory, under the Equal Protection Clause and Ti-\ntle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, his high \nschool’s policy for assigning students to restrooms and \nlocker rooms based on biological sex. The school’s policy \nprovides: (1) that the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms \nare designated for use by students who are biologically \nfemale; (2) that the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms are \ndesignated for use by students who are biologically male; \nand (3) that all students, regardless of their sex, are au-\nthorized to use the school’s three single-stall unisex rest-\nrooms,  which  the  school  created  to  accommodate \ntransgender  students.  Under  this  policy,  G.G.,  who  is \nbiologically female but who identifies as male, is author-\nized to use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms and the \nunisex restrooms. He contends, however, that the policy \ndiscriminates against him because it denies him, as one \nwho identifies as male, the use of the boys’ restrooms, \n\n41a \n \nand he seeks an injunction compelling the high school to \nallow him to use the boys’ restrooms.  \nThe district court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim, ex-\nplaining that the school complied with Title IX and its \nregulations,  which  permit  schools  to  provide  separate \nliving facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower fa-\ncilities “on the basis of sex,” so long as the facilities are \n“comparable.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b), \n106.33.  \nStrikingly,  the  majority  now  reverses  the  district \ncourt’s ruling, without any supporting case law, and con-\ncludes that when Title IX and its regulations provide for \nseparate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, the statute’s and \nregulations’ use of the term “sex” means a person’s gen-\nder identity, not the person’s biological status as male or \nfemale. To accomplish its goal, the majority relies entire-\nly on a 2015 letter sent by the Department of Educa-\ntion’s Office for Civil Rights to G.G., in which the Office \nfor Civil Rights stated, “When a school elects to separate \nor treat students differently on the basis of sex [when \nproviding  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  shower  facilities, \nhousing, athletic teams, and single-sex classes], a school \ngenerally  must  treat  transgender  students  consistent \nwith their gender identity.” (Emphasis added). Accept-\ning that new definition of the statutory term “sex,” the \nmajority’s opinion, for the first time ever, holds that a \npublic high school may not provide separate restrooms \nand locker rooms on the basis of biological sex. Rather, it \nmust now allow a biological male student who identifies \nas female to use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms \nand, likewise, must allow a biological female student who \nidentifies as male to use the boys’ restrooms and locker \n\n42a \n \nrooms. This holding completely tramples on all univer-\nsally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are \nbased on the anatomical differences between the sexes. \nAnd, unwittingly, it also tramples on the very concerns \nexpressed by G.G., who said that he should not be forced \nto go to the girls’ restrooms because of the “severe psy-\nchological distress” it would inflict on him and because \nfemale students had “reacted negatively” to his presence \nin girls’ restrooms. Surely biological males who identify \nas females would encounter similar reactions in the girls’ \nrestroom, just as students physically exposed to students \nof the opposite biological sex would be likely to experi-\nence psychological distress. As a result, schools would no \nlonger  be  able  to  protect  physiological  privacy  as  be-\ntween students of the opposite biological sex.  \nThis  unprecedented  holding  overrules  custom,  cul-\nture, and the very demands inherent in human nature for \nprivacy and safety, which the separation of such facilities \nis designed to protect. More particularly, it also miscon-\nstrues the clear language of Title IX and its regulations. \nAnd finally, it reaches an unworkable and illogical result.  \nThe recent Office for Civil Rights letter, moreover, \nwhich is not law but which is the only authority on which \nthe  majority  relies,  states  more  than  the  majority \nacknowledges. In the sentence following the sentence on \nwhich the majority relies, the letter states that, to ac-\ncommodate  transgender  students,  schools  are  encour-\naged “to offer the use of gender-neutral, individual-user \nfacilities to any student who does not want to use shared \nsex-segregated facilities [as permitted by Title IX’s reg-\nulations].” This appears to approve the course that G.G.’s \nschool followed when it created unisex restrooms in addi-\ntion to the boys’ and girls’ restrooms it already had.  \n\n43a \n \nTitle  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  are  not \nambiguous. In recognition of physiological privacy and \nsafety concerns, they allow schools to provide “separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, \nprovided  that  the  facilities  are  “proportionate”  and \n“comparable,”  34  C.F.R.  §  106.32(b),  and  to  provide \n“separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the \nbasis of sex,” again provided that the facilities are “com-\nparable,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. Because the school’s policy \nthat G.G. challenges in this action comports with Title IX \nand its regulations, I would affirm the district court’s \ndismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim. \n \nI \nThe relevant facts are not in dispute. G.G. is a 16 \nyear-old who attends Gloucester High School in Glouces-\nter County, Virginia. He is biologically female, but “did \nnot feel like a girl” from an early age. Still, he enrolled at \nGloucester High School for his freshman year as a fe-\nmale. \nDuring  his  freshman  year,  however,  G.G.  told  his \nparents that he considered himself to be transgender, \nand shortly thereafter, at his request, he began therapy \nwith  a  psychologist,  who  diagnosed  him  with  gender \ndysphoria, a condition of distress brought about by the \nincongruence of one’s biological sex and gender identity.  \nIn  August  2014,  before  beginning  his  sophomore \nyear, G.G. and his mother met with the principal and \nguidance counselor at Gloucester High School to discuss \nhis need, as part of his treatment, to socially transition at \nschool. The school accommodated all of his requests. Of-\nficials changed school records to reflect G.G.’s new male \nname; the guidance counselor supported G.G.’s sending \n\n44a \n \nan email to teachers explaining that he was to be ad-\ndressed using his new name and to be referred to using \nmale pronouns; G.G. was permitted to fulfill his physical \neducation requirement through a home-bound program, \nas he preferred not to use the school’s locker rooms; and \nthe school allowed G.G. to use a restroom in the nurse’s \noffice  “because  [he]  was  unsure  how  other  students \nwould react to [his] transition.” G.G. was grateful for the \nschool’s  “welcoming  environment.”  As  he  stated,  “no \nteachers,  administrators,  or  staff  at  Gloucester  High \nSchool expressed any resistance to calling [him] by [his] \nlegal name or referring to [him] using male pronouns.” \nAnd he was “pleased to discover that [his] teachers and \nthe vast majority of [his] peers respected the fact that \n[he is] a boy.”  \nAs  the  school  year  began,  however,  G.G.  found  it \n“stigmatizing” to continue using the nurse’s restroom, \nand he requested to use the boys’ restrooms. The princi-\npal also accommodated this request. But the very next \nday, the School Board began receiving “numerous com-\nplaints from parents and students about [G.G.’s] use of \nthe boys’ restrooms.” The School Board thus faced a di-\nlemma.  It  recognized  G.G.’s  feelings,  as  he  expressed \nthem, that “[u]sing the girls’ restroom[s] [was] not possi-\nble”  because  of  the  “severe  psychological  distress”  it \nwould inflict on him and because female students had \npreviously “reacted negatively” to his presence in the \ngirls’ restrooms. It now also had to recognize that boys \nhad similar feelings caused by G.G.’s use of the boys’ \nrestrooms, although G.G. stated that he continued using \nthe boys’ restrooms for some seven weeks without per-\nsonally receiving complaints from fellow students.  \n\n45a \n \nThe Gloucester County School Board considered the \nproblem and, after two public meetings, adopted a com-\npromise policy, as follows:  \nWhereas the GCPS recognizes that some stu-\ndents question their gender identities, and  \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students \nto  seek  support,  advice,  and  guidance  from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, \nand  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide \nmale and female restroom and locker room fa-\ncilities in its schools, and the use of said facili-\nties shall be limited to the corresponding bio-\nlogical genders, and students with gender iden-\ntity issues shall be provided an alternative ap-\npropriate private facility.  \nGloucester High School promptly implemented the poli-\ncy and created three single-stall unisex restrooms for \nuse by all students, regardless of their biological sex or \ngender identity.  \nIn  December  2014,  G.G.  sought  an  opinion  letter \nabout his situation from the U.S. Department of Educa-\ntion’s Office for Civil Rights, and on January 15, 2015, \nthe Office responded, stating, as relevant here:  \nThe Department’s Title IX regulations permit \nschools  to  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms, \nlocker rooms, shower facilities, housing, athlet-\nic teams, and single-sex classes under certain \n\n46a \n \ncircumstances. When a school elects to sepa-\nrate or treat students differently on the basis \nof sex in those situations, a school generally \nmust  treat  transgender  students  consistent \nwith their gender identity. [The Office for Civil \nRights] also encourages schools to offer the use \nof gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to \nany student who does not want to use shared \nsex-segregated facilities.  \nG.G. commenced this action in June 2015, alleging \nthat the Gloucester County School Board’s policy was \ndiscriminatory,  in  violation  of  the  U.S.  Constitution’s \nEqual Protection Clause and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. He sought \ndeclaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages. With \nhis complaint, G.G. also filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction “requiring the School Board to allow [him] to \nuse the boys’ restrooms at school.”  \nThe district court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim be-\ncause Title IX’s implementing regulations permit schools \nto provide separate restrooms “on the basis of sex.” The \ncourt also denied G.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunc-\ntion. As to the Equal Protection claim, the court has not \nyet ruled on whether G.G. failed to state a claim, but, at \nthe hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, it \nindicated that it “will hear evidence” and “get a date set” \nfor trial to better assess the claim.  \nFrom the district court’s order denying G.G.’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, G.G. filed this appeal, in \nwhich he also challenges the district court’s Title IX rul-\ning as inextricably intertwined with the district court’s \ndenial of the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n \n\n47a \n \nII(cid:2) \nG.G. recognizes that persons who are born biological-\nly female “typically” identify psychologically as female, \nand likewise, that persons who are born biologically male \n“typically” identify as male. Because G.G. was born bio-\nlogically female but identifies as male, he characterizes \nhimself as a transgender male. He contends that because \nhe is transgender, the School Board singled him out for \n“different  and  unequal  treatment,”  “discriminat[ing] \nagainst him based on sex [by denying him use of the \nboys’ restrooms], in violation of Title IX.” He argues, \n“discrimination against transgender people is necessari-\nly discrimination based on sex because it is impossible to \ntreat people differently based on their transgender sta-\ntus without taking their sex into account.” He concludes \nthat the School Board’s policy addressing restrooms and \nlocker rooms thus illegally fails to include transgender \npersons on the basis of their gender identity. In particu-\nlar, he concludes that he is “prevent[ed] . . . from using \nthe same restrooms as other students and relegat[ed] . . . \nto separate, single-stall facilities.”  \nAs noted, the School Board’s policy designates the \nuse of restrooms and locker rooms based on the stu-\ndent’s biological sex—biological females are assigned to \nthe  girls’  restrooms  and  unisex  restrooms;  biological \nmales are assigned to the boys’ restrooms and unisex \nrestrooms. G.G. is thus assigned to the girls’ restrooms \nand the unisex restrooms, but is denied the use of the \nboys’ restrooms. He asserts, however, that because nei-\nther he nor the girls would accept his use of the girls’ re-\nstroom, he is relegated to the unisex restrooms, which is \nstigmatizing. \n\n48a \n \nThe School Board contends that it is treating all stu-\ndents the same way, as it explains:  \nThe School Board’s policy does not discrimi-\nnate against any class of students. Instead, the \npolicy was developed to treat all students and \nsituations the same. To respect the safety and \nprivacy of all students, the School Board has \nhad a long-standing practice of limiting the use \nof restroom and locker room facilities to the \ncorresponding  biological  sex  of  the  students. \nThe School Board also provides three single-\nstall bathrooms for any student to use regard-\nless  of  his  or  her  biological  sex.  Under  the \nSchool Board’s restroom policy, G.G. is being \ntreated like every other student in the Glouces-\nter  Schools.  All  students  have  two  choices. \nEvery student can use a restroom associated \nwith  their  anatomical  sex,  whether  they  are \nboys or girls. If students choose not to use the \nrestroom associated with their anatomical sex, \nthe students can use a private, single-stall rest-\nroom. No student is permitted to use the rest-\nroom of the opposite sex. As a result, all stu-\ndents,  including  female  to  male  transgender \nand male to female transgender students, are \ntreated the same.  \nWhile G.G. has pending a claim under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause (on which the district court has not yet \nruled), only his preliminary injunction challenge and Ti-\ntle IX claim are before us at this time. \nTitle IX provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the \n\n49a \n \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance \n. . . .  \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). The Act, however, \nprovides,  “Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary \ncontained in this chapter, nothing contained herein shall \nbe construed to prohibit any educational institution re-\nceiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.” Id. § 1686 (em-\nphasis added); see also 34 C.F.R. § 106.32(b) (permitting \nschools to provide “separate housing on the basis of sex” \nas long as the housing is “proportionate” and “compara-\nble” (emphasis added)). Similarly, implementing Regula-\ntion 106.33 provides for particular separate facilities, as \nfollows:  \nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut such facilities provided for students of one \nsex shall be comparable to such facilities pro-\nvided for students of the other sex.  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added). Thus, although Ti-\ntle IX and its regulations provide generally that a school \nreceiving federal funds may not discriminate on the basis \nof sex, they also specify that a school does not violate the \nAct by providing, on the basis of sex, separate living fa-\ncilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities.  \nWhile G.G. only challenges the definition and applica-\ntion  of  the  term  “sex”  with  respect  to  separate  rest-\nrooms,  acceptance  of  his  argument  would  necessarily \nchange the definition of “sex” for purposes of assigning \n\n50a \n \nseparate living facilities, locker rooms, and shower facili-\nties as well. All are based on “sex,” a term that must be \nconstrued uniformly throughout Title IX and its imple-\nmenting  regulations.  See  Sullivan  v.  Stroop,  496  U.S. \n478, 484 (1990) (“[T]he normal rule of statutory construc-\ntion [is] that identical words used in different parts of the \nsame act are intended to have the same meaning” (inter-\nnal quotation marks and citations omitted)); In re Total \nRealty Mgmt., LLC, 706 F.3d 245, 251 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(“Canons of construction . . . require that, to the extent \npossible,  identical  terms  or  phrases  used  in  different \nparts of the same statute be interpreted as having the \nsame meaning. This presumption of consistent usage . . . \nensure[s] that the statutory scheme is coherent and con-\nsistent”  (alterations  in  original)  (internal  quotation \nmarks and citations omitted)); see also Kentuckians for \nCommonwealth Inc. v. Riverburgh, 317 F.3d 425, 440 \n(4th  Cir.  2003)  (“[B]ecause  a  regulation  must  be  con-\nsistent with the statute it implements, any interpretation \nof a regulation naturally must accord with the statute as \nwell” (quoting John F. Manning, Constitutional Struc-\nture and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations \nof  Agency  Rules,  96  Colum.  L.  Rev.  612,  627  n.78 \n(1996))).  \nAcross societies and throughout history, it has been \ncommonplace and universally accepted to separate pub-\nlic restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the \nbasis of biological sex in order to address privacy and \nsafety concerns arising from the biological differences \nbetween males and females. An individual has a legiti-\nmate and important interest in bodily privacy such that \nhis or her nude or partially nude body, genitalia, and \nother private parts are not exposed to persons of the op-\n\n51a \n \nposite  biological  sex.  Indeed,  courts  have  consistently \nrecognized that the need for such privacy is inherent in \nthe nature and dignity of humankind. See, e.g., Doe v. \nLuzerne Cnty., 660 F.3d 169, 176–77 (3d Cir. 2011) (rec-\nognizing that an individual has “a constitutionally pro-\ntected  privacy  interest  in  his  or  her  partially  clothed \nbody” and that this “reasonable expectation of privacy” \nexists “particularly while in the presence of members of \nthe opposite sex”); Brannum v. Overton Cnty. Sch. Bd., \n516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (explaining that “the \nconstitutional right to privacy . . . includes the right to \nshield one’s body from exposure to viewing by the oppo-\nsite sex”); Beard v. Whitmore Lake Sch. Dist., 402 F.3d \n598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Students of course have a sig-\nnificant  privacy  interest  in  their  unclothed  bodies”); \nSepulveda  v.  Ramirez,  967  F.2d  1413,  1416  (9th  Cir. \n1992) (explaining that “[t]he right to bodily privacy is \nfundamental”  and  that  “common  sense,  decency,  and \n[state] regulations” require recognizing it in a parolee’s \nright not to be observed by an officer of the opposite sex \nwhile producing a urine sample); Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d \n1117, 1119 (4th Cir. 1989) (recognizing that, even though \ninmates in prison “surrender many rights of privacy,” \ntheir “special sense of privacy in their genitals” should \nnot  be  violated  through  exposure  unless  “reasonably \nnecessary” and explaining that the “involuntary expo-\nsure of [genitals] in the presence of people of the other \nsex may be especially demeaning and humiliating”).  \nMoreover, we have explained that separating rest-\nrooms based on “acknowledged differences” between the \nbiological sexes serves to protect this important privacy \ninterest. See Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th \nCir. 1993) (noting “society’s undisputed approval of sepa-\n\n52a \n \nrate public rest rooms for men and women based on pri-\nvacy concerns”). Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized, \nwhen ordering an all-male Virginia college to admit fe-\nmale students, that such a remedy “would undoubtedly \nrequire alterations necessary to afford members of each \nsex privacy from the other sex.” United States v. Virgin-\nia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996). Such privacy was and \nremains necessary because of the inherent “[p]hysical \ndifferences between men and women,” which, as the Su-\npreme Court explained, are “enduring” and render “the \ntwo sexes . . . not fungible,” id. at 533 (distinguishing sex \nfrom  race  and  national  origin),  not  because  of  “one’s \nsense of oneself as belonging to a particular gender,” as \nG.G. and the government as amicus contend.  \nThus, Title IX’s allowance for the separation, based \non sex, of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities rests on the universally accepted con-\ncern for bodily privacy that is founded on the biological \ndifferences between the sexes. This privacy concern is \nalso linked to safety concerns that could arise from sexu-\nal responses prompted by students’ exposure to the pri-\nvate body parts of students of the other biological sex. \nIndeed, the School Board cited these very reasons for its \nadoption of the policy, explaining that it separates rest-\nrooms  and  locker  rooms  to  promote  the  privacy  and \nsafety of minor children, pursuant to its “responsibility \nto its students to ensure their privacy while engaging in \npersonal  bathroom  functions,  disrobing,  dressing,  and \nshowering outside of the presence of members of the op-\nposite sex. [That the school has this responsibility] is \nparticularly true in an environment   where   children   \nare   still   developing,   both emotionally and physically.” \n\n53a \n \nThe need to protect privacy and safety between the \nsexes based on physical exposure would not be present in \nthe same quality and degree if the term “sex” were to \nencompass only a person’s gender identity. Indeed, sep-\naration on this basis would function nonsensically. A bio-\nlogical male identifying as female could hardly live in a \ngirls’ dorm or shower in a girls’ shower without invading \nphysiological  privacy  needs,  and  the  same  would  hold \ntrue for a biological female identifying as male in a boys’ \ndorm or shower. G.G.’s answer, of course, is that he is \nnot challenging the separation, on the basis of sex, of liv-\ning facilities, locker rooms, and shower facilities, but only \nof restrooms, where the risks to privacy and safety are \nfar reduced. This effort to limit the scope of the issue ap-\nparently sways the majority, as it cabins its entire dis-\ncussion to “restroom access by transgender individuals.” \nAnte at 26. But this effort to restrict the effect of G.G.’s \nargument  hardly  matters  when  the  term  “sex”  would \nhave to be applied uniformly throughout the statute and \nregulations, as noted above and, indeed, as agreed to by \nthe majority. See ante at 26.  \nThe realities underpinning Title IX’s recognition of \nseparate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities are reflected in the plain language of \nthe statute and regulations, which is not ambiguous. The \ntext of Title IX and its regulations allowing for separa-\ntion of each facility “on the basis of sex” employs the \nterm “sex” as was generally understood at the time of \nenactment. See Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 \nU.S. 504, 512 (1994) (explaining that courts should not \ndefer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation \nif an “alternative reading is compelled by the regula-\ntion’s plain language or by other indications of the Secre-\n\n54a \n \ntary’s intent at the time of the regulation’s promulga-\ntion”  (emphasis  added)  (internal  quotation  marks  and \ncitation omitted)); see also Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, \n461 (1997) (discussing dictionary definitions of the regu-\nlation’s “critical phrase” to help determine whether the \nagency’s interpretation was “plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent  with  the  regulation”  (internal  quotation  marks \nand citation omitted)). Title IX was enacted in 1972 and \nthe regulations were promulgated in 1975 and readopted \nin 1980, and during that time period, virtually every dic-\ntionary definition of “sex” referred to the physiological \ndistinctions  between  males  and  females,  particularly \nwith  respect  to  their  reproductive  functions.  See,  e.g., \nThe Random House College Dictionary 1206 (rev. ed. \n1980) (“either the male or female division of a species, \nesp. as differentiated with reference to the reproductive \nfunctions”); Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 1054 \n(1979) (“the sum of the structural, functional, and behav-\nioral characteristics of living beings that subserve repro-\nduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish \nmales  and  females”);  American  Heritage  Dictionary \n1187 (1976) (“The property or quality by which organ-\nisms are classified according to their reproductive func-\ntions”); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary \n2081 (1971) (“the sum of the morphological, physiologi-\ncal, and behavioral peculiarities of living beings that sub-\nserves biparental reproduction with its concomitant ge-\nnetic segregation and recombination which underlie most \nevolutionary change . . .”); The American College Dic-\ntionary  1109  (1970)  (“the  sum  of  the  anatomical  and \nphysiological  differences  with  reference  to  which  the \nmale and the female are distinguished . . . ”). Indeed, alt-\nhough the contemporaneous meaning controls our analy-\n\n55a \n \nsis, it is notable that, even today, the term “sex” contin-\nues to be defined based on the physiological distinctions \nbetween  males  and  females.  See,  e.g.,  Webster’s  New \nWorld College Dictionary 1331 (5th ed. 2014) (“either of \nthe two divisions, male or female, into which persons, an-\nimals, or plants are divided, with reference to their re-\nproductive functions”); The American Heritage Diction-\nary 1605 (5th ed. 2011) (“Either of the two divisions, des-\nignated female and male, by which most organisms are \nclassified on the basis of their reproductive organs and \nfunctions”);  Merriam-Webster’s  Collegiate  Dictionary \n1140 (11th ed. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of \nindividuals that occur in many species and that are dis-\ntinguished respectively as female or male esp. on the ba-\nsis of their reproductive organs and structures”). Any \nnew definition of sex that excludes reference to physio-\nlogical differences, as the majority now attempts to in-\ntroduce, is simply an unsupported reach to rationalize a \ndesired outcome.  \nThus, when the School Board assigned restrooms and \nlocker rooms on the basis of biological sex, it was clearly \ncomplying precisely with the unambiguous language of \nTitle IX and its regulations. \nDespite the fact that the majority offers no case to \nsupport the definition of “sex” as advanced by G.G. and \nsupported by the government as amicus, the majority \nnonetheless accepts that the meaning of the term “sex” \nin Title IX and its regulations refers to a person’s “gen-\nder identity” simply to accommodate G.G.’s wish to use \nthe boys’ restrooms. But, it is not immediately apparent \nwhether G.G., the government, and the majority contend \nthat the term “sex” as used in Title IX and its regula-\ntions refers (1) to both biological sex and gender identity; \n\n56a \n \n(2) to either biological sex or gender identity; or (3) to \nonly “gender identity.” In his brief, G.G. seems to take \nthe position that the term “sex” at least includes a refer-\nence to gender identity. This is the position taken in his \ncomplaint when he alleges, “Under Title IX, discrimina-\ntion ‘on the basis of sex’ encompasses both discrimina-\ntion  based  on  biological  differences  between  men  and \nwomen and discrimination based on gender nonconform-\nity.” The government seems to be taking the same posi-\ntion, contending that the term “sex” “encompasses both \nsex—that is, the biological differences between men and \nwomen—and gender [identity].” (Emphasis in original). \nThe majority, however, seems to suggest that the term \n“sex” refers only to gender identity, as it relies solely on \nthe  statement  in  the  Office  for  Civil  Rights’  letter  of \nJanuary 7, 2015, which said, “When a school elects to \nseparate or treat students differently on the basis of sex \n[for the purpose of providing restrooms, locker rooms, \nand  other  facilities],  a  school  generally  must  treat \ntransgender students consistent with their gender iden-\ntity.” (Emphasis added). But, regardless of where G.G., \nthe government, and the majority purport to stand on \nthis question, the clear effect of their new definition of \nsex not only tramples the relevant statutory and regula-\ntory language and disregards the privacy concerns ani-\nmating that text, it is also illogical and unworkable.  \nIf the term “sex” as used in the statute and regula-\ntions refers to both biological sex and gender identity, \nthen, while the School Board’s policy is in compliance \nwith  respect  to  most  students,  whose  biological  sex \naligns with their gender identity, for students whose bio-\nlogical sex and gender identity do not align, no restroom \nor locker room separation could ever be accomplished \n\n57a \n \nconsistent  with  the  regulation  because  a  transgender \nstudent’s use of a boys’ or girls’ restroom or locker room \ncould not satisfy the conjunctive criteria. Given that G.G. \nand the government do not challenge schools’ ability to \nseparate restrooms and locker rooms for male and fe-\nmale students, surely they cannot be advocating an in-\nterpretation that places schools in an impossible position. \nMoreover, such an interpretation would deny G.G. the \nright to use either the boys’ or girls’ restrooms, a posi-\ntion that G.G. does not advocate.  \nIf the position of G.G., the government, and the ma-\njority is that the term “sex” means either biological sex \nor gender identity, then the School Board’s policy is in \ncompliance because it segregates the facilities on the ba-\nsis of biological sex, a satisfactory component of the dis-\njunctive.  \nTherefore, when asserting that G.G. must be allowed \nto  use  the  boys’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  as  con-\nsistent with his gender identity, G.G., the government, \nand the majority must be arguing that “sex” as used in \nTitle IX and its regulations means only gender identity. \nBut  this  construction  would,  in  the  end,  mean  that  a \nschool could never meaningfully provide separate rest-\nrooms and locker rooms on the basis of sex. Biological \nmales and females whose gender identity aligned would \nbe required to use the same restrooms and locker rooms \nas persons of the opposite biological sex whose gender \nidentity did not align. With such mixed use of separate \nfacilities, no purpose would be gained by designating a \nseparate use “on the basis of sex,” and privacy concerns \nwould be left unaddressed. \nMoreover, enforcement of any separation would be \nvirtually impossible. Basing restroom access on gender \n\n58a \n \nidentity would require schools to assume gender identity \nbased  on  appearances,  social  expectations,  or  explicit \ndeclarations of identity, which the government concedes \nwould render Title IX and its regulations nonsensical: \nCertainly  a  school  that  has  created  separate \nrestrooms for boys and girls could not decide \nthat only students who dress, speak, and act \nsufficiently masculine count as boys entitled to \nuse the boys’ restroom, or that only students \nwho wear dresses, have long hair, and act suffi-\nciently feminine may use the girls’ restroom.  \nYet, by interpreting Title IX and the regulations as “re-\nquiring schools to treat students consistent with their \ngender identity,” and by disallowing schools from treat-\ning students based on their biological sex, the govern-\nment’s position would have precisely the effect the gov-\nernment finds to be at odds with common sense.  \nFinally, in arguing that he should not be assigned to \nthe girls’ restrooms, G.G. states that “it makes no sense \nto place a transgender boy in the girls’ restroom in the \nname of protecting student privacy” because “girls ob-\njected to his presence in the girls’ restrooms because \nthey perceived him as male.” But the same argument \napplies to his use of the boys’ restrooms, where boys felt \nuncomfortable because they perceived him as female. In \nany scenario based on gender identity, moreover, there \nwould be no accommodation for the recognized need for \nphysiological privacy.  \nIn short, it is impossible to determine how G.G., the \ngovernment, and the majority would apply the provisions \nof Title IX and the implementing regulations that allow \nfor the separation of living facilities, restrooms, locker \n\n59a \n \nrooms, and shower facilities “on the basis of sex” if “sex” \nmeans gender identity.  \nThe Office for Civil Rights letter, on which the major-\nity exclusively relies, hardly provides an answer. In one \nsentence  it  states  that  schools  “generally  must  treat \ntransgender students consistent with their gender iden-\ntity,” whatever that means, and in the next sentence, it \nencourages schools to provide “gender-neutral, individu-\nal-user facilities to any student who does not want to use \nshared  sex-segregated  facilities.”  While  the  first  sen-\ntence might be impossible to enforce without destroying \nall privacy-serving separation, the second sentence en-\ncourages  schools,  such  as  Gloucester  High  School,  to \nprovide  unisex  single-stall  restrooms  for  any  students \nwho are uncomfortable with sex-separated facilities, as \nthe school in fact provided.  \nAs it stands, Title IX and its implementing regula-\ntions authorize schools to separate, on the basis of sex, \nliving facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower fa-\ncilities, which must allow for separation on the basis of \nbiological sex. Gloucester High School thus clearly com-\nplied with the statute and regulations. But, as it did so, it \nwas nonetheless sensitive to G.G.’s gender transition, ac-\ncommodating virtually every wish that he had. Indeed, \nhe initially requested and was granted the use of the \nnurse’s restroom. And, after both girls and boys objected \nto his using the girls’ and boys’ restrooms, the school \nprovided individual unisex restrooms, as encouraged by \nthe letter from the Office for Civil Rights. Thus, while \nGloucester High School made a good-faith effort to ac-\ncommodate G.G. and help him in his transition, balancing \nits concern for him with its responsibilities to all stu-\ndents, it still acted legally in maintaining a policy that \n\n60a \n \nprovided all students with physiological privacy and safe-\nty in restrooms and locker rooms.  \nBecause the Gloucester County School Board did not \nviolate Title IX and Regulation 106.33 in adopting the \npolicy for separate restrooms and locker rooms, I would \naffirm the district court’s decision dismissing G.G.’s Title \nIX claim and therefore dissent. \nI also dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate \nthe district court’s denial of G.G.’s motion for a prelimi-\nnary injunction. As the Supreme Court has consistently \nexplained, “[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary \nremedy” that “may only be awarded upon a clear show-\ning that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,” and “‘[i]n \nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should \npay particular regard for the public consequences in em-\nploying the extraordinary remedy.’” Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef.  Council,  Inc.,  555  U.S.  7,  22–24  (2008)  (quoting \nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982)). \nGiven the facts that the district court fully and fairly \nsummarized in its opinion, including the hardships ex-\npressed both by G.G. and by other students, I cannot \nconclude that we can “form a definite and firm conviction \nthat the court below committed a clear error of judg-\nment,” Morris v. Wachovia Sec., Inc., 448 F.3d 268, 277 \n(4th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted), \nparticularly when we are only now expressing as binding \nlaw an evidentiary standard that the majority asserts the \ndistrict court violated.  \nAs noted, however, I concur in Part IV of the court’s \nopinion. \n   \n\n61a \n \nPUBLISHED \n \nFILED: May 31, 2016 \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 15-2056 \n(4:15-cv-0054-RGD-DEM) \nG.

R. \nApp. P. 35 on the petition for rehearing en banc, the peti-\ntion is denied. \n\n64a \n \nJudge  Niemeyer  wrote  an  opinion  dissenting  from \nthe denial of the petition for rehearing.  \nEntered at the direction of Judge Floyd. \n \nFor the Court \n \n/s/ Patricia S. Connor, Clerk \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial \nof the petition for rehearing:  \n \nBodily privacy is historically one of the most basic el-\nements of human dignity and individual freedom. And \nforcing a person of one biological sex to be exposed to \npersons of the opposite biological sex profoundly offends \nthis dignity and freedom. Have we not universally con-\ndemned as inhumane such forced exposure throughout \nhistory as it occurred in various contexts, such as in pris-\nons? And do parents not universally find it offensive to \nthink of having their children’s bodies exposed to per-\nsons of the opposite biological sex?  \nSomehow, all of this is lost in the current Administra-\ntion’s service of the politically correct acceptance of gen-\nder identification as the meaning of “sex”—indeed, even \nwhen the statutory text of Title IX provides no basis for \nthe position. The Department of Education and the Jus-\ntice Department, in a circular maneuver, now rely on the \nmajority’s opinion to mandate application of their posi-\ntion across the country, while the majority’s opinion had \nrelied solely on the Department of Education’s earlier \nunprecedented position. The majority and the Admin-\nistration—novelly and without congressional authoriza-\ntion—conclude  that  despite  Congress’s  unambiguous \n\n65a \n \nauthorization in Title IX to provide for the separation of \nrestrooms, showers, locker rooms, and dorms on the ba-\nsis  of  sex,  see  20  U.S.C.  § 1686;  34  C.F.R.  §§ 106.32, \n106.33, they can override these provisions by redefining \nsex to mean how any given person identifies himself or \nherself at any given time, thereby, of necessity, denying \nall affected persons the dignity and freedom of bodily \nprivacy. Virtually every civilization’s norms on this issue \nstand in protest.  \nThese longstanding norms are not a protest against \npersons who identify with a gender different from their \nbiological sex. To the contrary, schools and the courts \nmust, with care, seek to understand their condition and \naddress it in permissible ways that are as helpful as pos-\nsible in the circumstances. But that is not to say that, to \ndo so, we must bring down all protections of bodily pri-\nvacy that are inherent in individual human dignity and \nfreedom. Nor must we reject separation-of-powers prin-\nciples  designed  to  safeguard  Congress’s  policymaking \nrole and the States’ traditional powers.  \n     While I could call for a poll of the court in an effort to \nrequire counsel to reargue their positions before an en \nbanc court, the momentous nature of the issue deserves \nan open road to the Supreme Court to seek the Court’s \ncontrolling construction of Title IX for national applica-\ntion.  And the facts of this case, in particular, are espe-\ncially “clean,” such as to enable the Court to address the \nissue without the distraction of subservient issues.  For \nthis reason only and not because the issue is not suffi-\nciently weighty for our en banc court, I am not request-\ning a poll on the petition for rehearing en banc.  I do, \nhowever, vote to grant panel rehearing, which I recog-\nnize can only be symbolic in view of the majority’s ap-\n\n66a \n \nproach, which deferred to the Administration’s novel po-\nsition with a questionable application of Auer v. Robbins, \n519 U.S. 452 (1997).  Time is of the essence, and I can on-\nly urge the parties to seek Supreme Court review.  \n   \n\n67a \n \nFILED: June 9, 2016 \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n_____________ \n \nNo. 15-2056 \n(4:15-cv-0054-RGD-DEM) \n_____________ \n \nG.

On Sep-\ntember 4, 2015, this Court denied the Motion. ECF No. \n53. On appeal, the Court of Appeals vacated this denial \nand remanded the case for reevaluation of the Motion \nunder a different evidentiary standard. Op. of USCA, \nECF No. 62 at 33. The Court of Appeals also reversed \nthis Court’s dismissal of G.G.’s claim under Title IX. Id. \nat 26. In a concurrence, Judge Davis explained why the \nPreliminary Injunction should issue in light of the Court \n\n72a \n \nof Appeals’ analysis of Title IX. Id. at 37–44. It appears \nto the Court from the unrebutted declarations submitted \nby the parties that the plaintiff is entitled to use the \nboys’ restroom. Therefore, for the reasons set forth in \nthe aforesaid concurrence and based on the declarations \nsubmitted by the parties, the Court finds that the plain-\ntiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction.  \nAs noted in the Opinion of the Court of Appeals, this \ncase is only about G.G.’s access to the boys’ restrooms; \nG.G. has not requested access to the boys’ locker rooms. \nId. at 7 n. 2 (“G.G. does not participate in the school’s \nphysical education programs. He does not seek here, and \nnever  has  sought,  use  of the boys’  locker room.  Only \nrestroom use is at issue in this case.”). Accordingly, this \ninjunction is limited to restroom access and does not cov-\ner access to any other facilities.  \nBased  on  the  evidence  submitted  through  declara-\ntions previously proffered for the purpose of the hearing \non the Preliminary Injunction, this Court, pursuant to \nTitle  IX,  hereby  ORDERS  that  Gloucester  County \nSchool Board permit the plaintiff, G.G., to use the boys’ \nrestroom at Gloucester High School until further order \nof this Court.  \nThe Clerk is DIRECTED to forward a copy of this \nOrder to all Counsel of Record.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n /s/ Robert G.

With this \nMotion the defendant, Gloucester County School Board \n(“Defendant”), asks this Court to stay the Preliminary \nInjunction issued by the Court on June 23, 2016 pending \nDefendant’s appeal of that Order. Id.  \nOn  June  11,  2015,  the  plaintiff  in  this  case,  G.G. \n(“Plaintiff’), filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nECF No. 11. On September 4, 2015, this Court denied \nthe Motion.

In a concurrence, Judge \nDavis explained why the Preliminary Injunction should \nissue in light of the Court of Appeals’ analysis of Title \nIX. Id. at 37–44. \nThe Court of Appeals denied Defendant’s motion for \na rehearing en banc. Order of USCA, ECF No. 65, and \nits motion to stay the mandate pending the filing of a \nwrit of certiorari, Order of USCA, ECF No. 67. On June \n17, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate. ECF \nNo. 68.  \nBased on the opinion of the Fourth Circuit and the \nevidence  submitted  by  declaration,  the  Court  granted \nthe  Preliminary  Injunction  on  June  23,  2016.

ECF  Nos.  71–72.  Plaintiff  responded  to  the \nMotion on July 1, 2016. ECF No. 75.  \nThis Court is bound by the Judgment of the Court of \nAppeals. The Court of Appeals’ actions in denying a re-\nhearing en banc and a stay of its mandate indicate that it \ndesires that its Judgment take effect immediately. The \nCourt of Appeals itself is bound by its own prior prece-\ndents.  Although  Defendant  has  filed  an  appeal  of  the \nPreliminary Injunction, the Court of Appeals’ prior opin-\nion in this case will control in that appeal. This Court be-\nlieves that based on the law as laid out in that opinion \nand the evidence submitted by declarations in this case, \nthe Preliminary Injunction was warranted. There are no \n\n75a \n \ngrounds for a stay. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the \nMotion for Stay Pending Appeal.

G., by his next friend and mother, Deirdre Grimm, \n \nPlaintiff - Appellee, \n \nv. \n \nGLOUCESTER COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD, \n \nDefendant - Appellant. \n \n_____________ \n \nORDER \n_____________ \n \nUpon consideration of submissions relative to the mo-\ntion of appellant for stay pending appeal, the court de-\nnies the motion.  \nEntered  at  the  direction  of  Judge  Floyd.  Senior \nJudge Davis wrote an opinion concurring in the denial of \na stay pending the filing of, and action on, a petition for \ncertiorari. Judge Niemeyer wrote an opinion dissenting \nfrom the denial of a stay pending appeal.  \n\n77a \n \n \nFor the Court \n \n/s/ Patricia S. Connor, Clerk \n \nDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in the denial of \na stay pending the filing of, and action on, a petition for \ncertiorari:  \n \nI vote to deny the motion for stay. \nIn Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 235 \n(1989), plaintiff Ann Hopkins received comments from \npartners describing her as “macho,” suggesting that she \n“overcompensated for being a woman,” and “advis[ing] \nher to take a course at charm school” during her bid for \npartnership. Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. 228, 235 (1989) \n(citations omitted). Hopkins was told that to improve her \nchances of attaining partnership, she should “walk more \nfemininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, \nwear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.” \nId. (citation omitted). Rejecting Price Waterhouse’s in-\nsinuation that acting in reliance on sex stereotyping was \nnot prohibited by Title VII, the Supreme Court unequiv-\nocally stated otherwise:  \n[W]e are beyond the day when an employer \ncould evaluate employees by assuming or in-\nsisting that they matched the stereotype asso-\nciated  with  their  group,  for  “[i]n  forbidding \nemployers to discriminate against individuals \nbecause  of  their  sex,  Congress  intended  to \nstrike  at  the  entire  spectrum  of  disparate \ntreatment of men and women resulting from \nsex stereotypes.” \n\n78a \n \nId. at 251 (second alteration in original) (quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. \n702, 707, n.13 (1978)). The Supreme Court has expressly \nrecognized that claims based on an individual’s failure to \nconform to societal expectations based on that person’s \ngender constitute discrimination “because of sex” under \nTitle VII. Id. at 250–51 (plurality); Price Waterhouse, \n490 U.S. at 272–73 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Price Wa-\nterhouse, 490 U.S. at 260–61 (White, J., concurring).  \nThe First, Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have \nall recognized that discrimination against a transgender \nindividual based on that person’s transgender status is \ndiscrimination because of sex under federal civil rights \nstatutes and the Equal Protection Clause of the Consti-\ntution. See Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316–19 \n(11th Cir. 2011) (holding that terminating an employee \nbecause she is transgender violates the prohibition on \nsex-based  discrimination  under  the  Equal  Protection \nClause  following  the  reasoning  of  Price  Waterhouse); \nSmith v. City of Salem, Ohio, 378 F.3d 566, 573–75 (6th \nCir. 2004) (holding that transgender employee had stat-\ned a claim under Title VII based on the reasoning of \nPrice Waterhouse); Rosa v. Park W. Bank & Trust Co., \n214  F.3d  213,  215–16  (1st  Cir.  2000)  (holding  that  a \ntransgender individual could state a claim for sex dis-\ncrimination  under  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act \nbased on Price Waterhouse); Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 \nF.3d  1187,  1201–03  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (holding  that  a \ntransgender  individual  could  state  a  claim  under  the \nGender Motivated Violence Act under the reasoning of \nPrice Waterhouse).  \nOn this long-settled jurisprudential foundation, our \nfriend’s assertion that the majority opinion issued when \n\n79a \n \nthis case was previously before us is “unprecedented” \nmisses the mark. In any event, as regards the standards \nfor a stay, the dissent contains its own rebuttal. Contrary \nto the dissent’s assertion that “the School Board has con-\nstructed  three  unisex  bathrooms  to  accommodate  any \nperson who feels uncomfortable using facilities separat-\ned on the basis of sex,” the three unisex bathrooms are in \nfact available to “any student” at the school. Mot. for \nStay at 5.  \n     In  short,  there  is  no  reason  to  disturb  the  district \ncourt’s exercise  of  discretion  in  denying  the  motion  \nto  stay  its preliminary injunction.  \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial \nof a stay pending appeal:  \n \nI would grant Gloucester County School Board’s mo-\ntion for a stay pending appeal. See Long v. Robinson, 432 \nF.2d  977  (4th  Cir.  1970);  cf.  Winter  v.  National  Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008). Facial-\nly, the district court conducted no analysis required by \nWinter for the entry of a preliminary injunction, relying \nonly on our earlier decision in this case. And under the \nbalancing analysis prescribed by Long, I conclude that a \nstay is appropriate, based on the following:  \n1. The earlier groundbreaking decision of this court \nis, as I have noted previously, unprecedented. Indeed, it \nappears to violate the clear, unambiguous language of \nTitle IX, which explicitly authorizes the provision of var-\nious separate facilities “on the basis of sex.” Moreover, \nthe court’s decision applying deference under Auer v. \nRobins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), is questionable, and, even if \ndeference were appropriate, it relies solely on a letter \n\n80a \n \nfrom the U.S. Department of Education, imposing an en-\ntirely new interpretation of “sex” in Title IX without the \nsupport of any law. In view of this, it is difficult to under-\nstand how the decision is sustainable.  \n2. By enforcing the injunction now, male students at \nGloucester High School will be denied the separate facili-\nties provided by the School Board on the basis of sex, as \nauthorized by Congress, and thus will be denied bodily \nprivacy when using the facilities, to the dismay of the \nstudents and their parents. These consequences are like-\nly to cause disruption both in the school and among the \nparents.  \n3. While I recognize the sensitivities of G.G.’s gender \ntransition, I nonetheless conclude that he is unlikely to \nsuffer  substantial  injury  from  a  stay  of  the  district \ncourt’s injunction, particularly because the School Board \nhas constructed three unisex bathrooms to accommodate \nany person who feels uncomfortable using facilities sepa-\nrated on the basis of sex.  \n4. The public interest in a final and orderly resolution \nof G.G.’s claims before enforcement of this court’s deci-\nsion is served by a stay pending appeal. The changes \nthat  this  injunction  would  require—and  that  the  De-\npartment of Justice and Department of Education now \nseek to impose nationwide on the basis of our earlier de-\ncision—mark a dramatic departure from the responsi-\nbilities local school boards have heretofore understood \nand the authorizations that Congress has long provided. \nThese  school  boards  and  the  communities  they  serve \nwould benefit from the thoughtful and final disposition of \nG.G.’s claims, and from ultimate guidance from the Su-\npreme Court or Congress, before having to undertake \nthese sweeping reforms. \n\n81a \n \nIn  short,  I  conclude  that  the  Gloucester  County \nSchool Board has adequately made its case for a stay \npending appeal, and I would grant its motion for such a \nstay. \n \n   \n\n82a \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNEWPORT NEWS DIVISION  \n \nFILED \nSeptember 4, 2015 \n Clerk, US District Court \nNorfolk, VA \nG.G., by his next friend and mother, \nDEIRDRE GRIMM, \n \nPlaintiff  \n \nv.

CIVIL NO. 4:15cv54 \n \nGLOUCESTER COUNTY SCHOOL  \nBOARD,  \n \nDefendant.  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiff G.G.’s \nchallenge  to  a  recent  resolution  (the  “Resolution”) \npassed  by  the  Gloucester  County  School  Board  (the \n“School Board) on December 9, 2014. This Resolution \naddresses the restroom and locker room policy for all \nstudents in Gloucester County Public Schools. Specifical-\nly, G.G. brings claims under both the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Equal Pro-\ntection Clause”) and Title IX of the Education Amend-\n\n85a \n \nments of 1972 (“Title IX”), seeking to contest the School \nBoard’s restroom policy under the Resolution.(cid:2) \nOn June 11, 2015, G.G. filed a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, ECF No. 11, and on July 7, 2015, the School \nBoard filed a Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 31. On July \n27, 2015, the parties appeared before the Court and ar-\ngued their respective positions as to both motions. ECF \nNo. 47. At that hearing, the Court took both motions un-\nder advisement. From the bench, the Court GRANTED \nthe Motion to Dismiss as to Count II, G.G.’s claim under \nTitle IX. On September 4, 2015, the Court DENIED the \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Injunction.  ECF  No.  53.  This \nopinion memorializes the reasons for these orders.  \n \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \nThe following summary is taken from the factual al-\nlegations contained in Plaintiff’s Complaint, which, for \npurposes of ruling on the Motion to Dismiss as to Count \nII, the Court accepts as true. Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. \nConsumeraffairs.com. Inc., 591 F.3d 250. 253 (4th Cir. \n2009). \nThis case arises from a student’s challenge to a re-\ncent restroom policy passed by the School Board. Plain-\ntiff G.G. was born in Gloucester County on [redacted], \n1999 and designated female.1 Compl. ¶¶ 12, 14. However, \nat a very young age, G.G. did not feel like a girl. Id. at 16. \nBefore age six, Plaintiff “refused to wear girl clothes.” \n                                                   \n1 For the sake of brevity occasionally in this opinion the term “birth \nsex” may be used to describe the sex assigned to individuals at their \nbirth. “Natal female” will be used to describe the gender assigned to \nG.G. at birth. \n\n86a \n \nId.  ¶ 17.  Starting  at  approximately  age  twelve,  “G.G \nacknowledged his male gender identity to himself.”2 Id. \n¶ 18. In 2013–14, during G.G.’s freshman year of high \nschool, most of his friends were aware that he identified \nas male. Id. ¶¶ 18–19. Furthermore, away from home and \nschool, G.G. presented himself as a male. Id. ¶ 19. \nDuring G.G.’s freshman year of high school, which \nbegan in September 2013, he  experienced severe de-\npression and anxiety related to the stress of concealing \nhis gender identity from his family. Id. ¶ 20. This is the \nreason he alleges that he did not attend school during \nthe spring semester of his freshman year, from January \n2014 to June 2014, and instead took classes through a \nhome-bound program. Id. In April 2014, G.G. first in-\nformed his parents that he is transgender, that is, he be-\nlieved that he was a man.3 Id. ¶ 21. Sometime after in-\nforming his parents that he is transgender in April 2014, \nG.G., at his own request, began to see a psychologist, \n                                                   \n2 The American Psychiatric Association (“APA”) defines “gender \nidentity” as “an individual’s identification as male, female, or, occa-\nsionally, some category other than male or female.” American Psy-\nchiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (“DSM”). The DSM is “a classification \nof mental disorders with associated criteria designed to facilitate \nmore reliable diagnoses of these disorders.” Id. at xli. Although the \nDSM was included in G.G.’s briefs, it was not alleged in the Com-\nplaint and will consequently not be considered for the purpose of the \nMotion to Dismiss. However, the Court finds it instructive for defi-\nnitional purposes.  \n3 The APA defines “transgender” as “the broad spectrum of individ-\nuals who transiently or persistently identify with a gender different \nfrom their natal gender.” Id. \n \n\n87a \n \nwho subsequently diagnosed him with Gender Dyspho-\nria.4 Id. ¶ 21. As part of G.G.’s treatment, his psycholo-\ngist recommended that G.G. begin living in accordance \nwith his male gender identity in all respects. Id. ¶ 23. \nThe psychologist provided G.G. with a “Treatment Doc-\numentation Letter” that confirmed that “he was receiv-\ning treatment for Gender Dysphoria and that, as part of \nthat treatment, he should be treated as a boy in all re-\nspects, including with respect to his use of the restroom.” \nId. The psychologist also recommended that G.G. “see an \nendocrinologist and begin hormone treatment.” Id. ¶ 26.  \nSubsequently,  G.G.  sought  to  implement  his  psy-\nchologist’s recommendation. Id. ¶ 25. In July 2014, G.G. \npetitioned  the  Circuit  Court  of  Gloucester  County  to \nchange his legal name to his present masculine name \nand, the court granted his petition. Id. At his own re-\nquest, G.G.’s new name is used for all purposes, and his \nfriends and family refer to him using male pronouns. Id. \nAdditionally, when out in public, G.G. uses the boys’ rest-\nroom. Id. \nG.G. also sought to implement his lifestyle transition \nat school. In August 2014, G.G. and his mother notified \nofficials  at  Gloucester  High  School  that  G.G.  is \ntransgender and that he had changed his name. Id. ¶ 27. \nConsequently, officials changed school records to reflect \nG.G.’s new masculine name. Id. Furthermore, before the \nbeginning of the 2014–15 school year, G.G. and his moth-\ner met with the school principal and guidance counselor \nto discuss his social transition. Id. ¶ 28. The school rep-\n                                                   \n4 The APA defines “gender dysphoria” as “the distress that may \naccompany the incongruence between one’s experienced and ex-\npressed gender and one’s assigned gender.” Id. \n\n88a \n \nresentatives allowed G.G. to email teachers and inform \nthem that he preferred to be addressed using his new \nname and male pronouns. Id. Being unsure how students \nwould react to his transition, G.G. initially agreed to use \na separate bathroom in the nurse’s office. Id. ¶ 30. G.G. \nwas also permitted to continue his physical education re-\nquirement through his home school program. Id. ¶ 29. \nConsequently, G.G. “has not and does not intend to use a \nlocker room at school.” Id. \nHowever,  after  2014–15  school  year  began,  G.G. \nfound it stigmatizing to use a separate restroom. Id. ¶ 31. \nG.G.  requested  to  use  the  male  restroom.  Id.  On  or \naround October 20, 2014, the school principal agreed to \nG.G.’s request. Id. ¶ 32. For the next seven weeks, G.G. \nused the boys’ restroom. Id.  \nSome  members  of  the  community  disapproved  of \nG.G.’s use of the men’s bathroom when they learned of it. \nId. ¶ 33. Some of these individuals contacted members of \nthe School Board and asked that G.G. be prohibited from \nusing the men’s restroom. Id. Shortly before the School \nBoard’s meeting on November 11, 2014, one of its mem-\nbers added an item to the agenda, titled “Discussion of \nUse of Restrooms/Locker Room Facilities,” along with a \nproposed resolution. Id. ¶ 34. This proposed resolution \nstated as follows:  \nWhereas  the  [Gloucester  County  Public \nSchools] recognizes that some students ques-\ntion their gender identities, and  \nWhereas  the  [Gloucester  County  Public \nSchools]  encourages  such  students  to  seek \nsupport,  advice,  and  guidance  from  parents, \nprofessionals and other trusted adults, and  \n\n89a \n \nWhereas  the  [Gloucester  County  Public \nSchools] seeks to provide a safe learning envi-\nronment for all students and to protect the pri-\nvacy of all students, therefore  \nIt  shall  be  the  practice  of  the  [Gloucester \nCounty  Public  Schools]  to  provide  male  and \nfemale restroom and locker room facilities in \nits schools, and the use of said facilities shall be \nlimited  to  the  corresponding  biological  gen-\nders, and students with gender identity issues \nshall  be  provided  an  alternative  appropriate \nprivate facility.  \nId. ¶ 34. At the meeting, a majority of the twenty-seven \npeople who spoke were in favor of the proposal. Id. ¶ 37. \nSome proponents argued that transgender students’ use \nof the restrooms would violate the privacy of other stu-\ndents  and  might  “lead  to  sexual  assault  in  the  bath-\nrooms.” Id. It was suggested that a non-transgender boy \ncould come to the school in a dress and demand to use \nthe girls’ restroom. Id. G.G. addressed the group and \nspoke against the proposed resolution and thus identified \nhimself to the entire community. Id. ¶ 38. At the end of \nthe meeting, the School Board voted 4-3 to defer a vote \non the policy until its meeting on December 9, 2014. Id. \n¶ 39.  \nOn  December  3,  2014,  the  School  Board  issued  a \nnews release stating that regardless of the outcome, it \nintended  to  take  measures  to  increase  privacy  for  all \nstudents using school restrooms, including “expanding \npartitions between urinals in male restrooms”; “adding \nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms”; and \n“designat[ing] single-stall, unisex restrooms, similar to \n\n90a \n \nwhat’s in many other public spaces.” Id. ¶ 41. On Decem-\nber 9, 2014, the School Board held a meeting to vote on \nthe proposed resolution. Id. Before the vote was con-\nducted, a Citizens’ Comments Period was held to allow a \ndiscussion on the proposed resolution. Id. Again, a ma-\njority of the speakers supported the resolution. Id. ¶ 42. \nSpeakers again raised concerns about the privacy of oth-\ner students. Id. After thirty-seven people spoke during \nthe Citizens’ Comment Period, the School Board voted 6-\n1 to pass the Resolution. Id. ¶ 43. \nOn  December  10,  2015,  the  day  after  the  School \nBoard  passed  the  Resolution,  the  school  principal  in-\nformed G.G. that he could no longer use the boys’ rest-\nroom and would be disciplined if he did. Id. ¶ 45. \nSince  the  adoption  of  the  restroom  policy,  certain \nphysical  improvements  have  been  made  to  the  school \nrestrooms at Gloucester High School. The school has in-\nstalled three unisex single-stall restrooms. Id. ¶ 47. The \nschool has also raised the doors and walls around the \nbathroom stalls so that students cannot see into an ad-\njoining stall. Id. Additionally, partitions were installed \nbetween the urinals in the boys’ restrooms. Id. \nSometime after the actions of the School Board, G.G. \nbegan receiving hormone treatment in December 2014. \nId. ¶ 26. These treatments have deepened his voice, in-\ncreased the growth of his facial hair, and given him a \nmore masculine appearance. Id. \nIt is alleged that “[u]sing the girls’ restroom is not \npossible for G.G.” Id. ¶ 46. G.G. alleges that prior to his \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria, girls and women who \nencountered G.G. in female restrooms would react nega-\ntively  because  of  his  masculine  appearance;  that  in \neighth and ninth grade, the period from September 2012 \n\n91a \n \nto June 2014, girls at school would ask him to leave the \nfemale  restroom;  and  that  use  of  the  girls’  restroom \nwould also cause G.G. “severe psychological stress” and \nwould  be  “incompatible  with  his  medically  necessary \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria.” Id. \nG.G. further alleges that he refuses to use the sepa-\nrate  single-stall  restrooms  installed  by  the  school  be-\ncause the use of them would stigmatize and isolate him; \nthat the use of these restrooms would serve as a remind-\ner that the school views him as “different”; and that the \nschool  community  knows  that  the  restrooms  were  in-\nstalled for him. Id. \nFrom  these  alleged  facts,  on  June  11,  2015,  G.G. \nbrought  the  present  challenge  to  the  School  Board’s \nrestroom policy under the Equal Protection Clause and \nTitle IX. ECF No. 8. On that same day, G.G. filed the in-\nstant Motion for Preliminary Injunction, requesting that \nthe Court issue an injunction allowing G.G. to use the \nboys’ bathroom at Gloucester High School until this case \nis decided at trial. ECF No. 11. On June 29, 2015, the \nUnited States (“the Government”), through the Depart-\nment of Justice, filed a Statement of Interest, asserting \nthat the School Board’s bathroom policy violated Title \nIX. ECF No. 28. The School Board filed an Opposition to \nthe Motion for Preliminary Injunction on July 7, 2015, \nECF No. 30, along with a Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. \n31. On July 27, 2015, the parties appeared before the \nCourt and argued their respective positions as to both \nmotions. ECF No. 47. At that hearing, the Court took \nboth  motions  under  advisement.  From  the  bench,  the \nCourt granted the Motion to Dismiss as to Count II, \nG.G.’s claim under Title IX. On September 4, 2015, the \nCourt  denied  the  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction. \n\n92a \n \nECF No. 53. This opinion memorializes the reasons for \nthese orders.  \n \nII. MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nA. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nThe  function  of  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Rule \n12(b)(6) is to test “the sufficiency of a  complaint.” Occu-\npy Columbia v. Haley, 738 F.3d 107, 116 (4th Cir. 2013). \n“[I]mportantly, it does not resolve contests surrounding \nthe facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of de-\nfenses.” Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d \n943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992). “To survive such a motion, the \ncomplaint must allege facts sufficient ‘to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level’ and ‘state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.’ ” Haley, 738 F.3d at \n116. When reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint, \nthe Court must accept “all well-pleaded allegations in the \nplaintiffs complaint as true” and draw “all reasonable \nfactual inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs fa-\nvor.” Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 244 \n(4th Cir. 1999). Legal conclusions, on the other hand, are \nnot entitled to the assumption of truth if they are not \nsupported by factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S.  662,  678  (2009).  However,  a  motion  to  dismiss \nshould be granted only in “very limited circumstances.” \nRogers v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 883 F.2d 324, 325 \n(4th Cir. 1989). \n \n\n93a \n \nB. COUNT II - TITLE IX \n \nG.G. also alleges that the School Board’s bathroom \npolicy violates Title IX. Under Title IX, “[n]o person in \nthe United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  pro-\ngram . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). “Under Title IX, a prima \nfacie case is established by a plaintiff showing (1) that \n[he or] she was excluded from participation in (or denied \nthe benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in) an edu-\ncational program; (2) that the program receives federal \nassistance; and (3) that the exclusion was on the basis of \nsex.” Manolov v. Borough of Manhattan Comm. Coll., \n952 F. Supp. 2d 522, 532 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Mur-\nray v. N.Y. Univ. Coll. of Dentistry, No. 93 Civ. 8771, \n1994  WL  533411,  at  *5  (S.D.N.Y.  Sept.  29,  1994)); \nBougher v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 713 F. Supp. 139, 143–44 \n(W.D. Pa. 1989), aff’d, 882 F.2d 74 (3d Cir. 1989)).  \nThe School Board Resolution expressly differentiates \nbetween students who have a gender identity congruent \nwith their birth sex and those who do not. Compl. ¶ 34. \nG.G. alleges that this exclusion from the boys’ bathroom \nbased on his gender identity constitutes sex discrimina-\ntion under Title IX. Compl. ¶¶ 64, 65.  \n \n1. Arguments \n \nThe parties contest whether discrimination based on \ngender  identity  is  barred  under  Title  IX.  To  support \ntheir respective contentions, both parties cite to cases \ninterpreting Title VII, upon which courts have routinely \nrelied in determining the breadth of Title IX. See Jen-\n\n94a \n \nnings v. Univ. of N.C., 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) \n(“We look to case law interpreting Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 for guidance in evaluating a claim \nbrought under Title IX.”). \nThe  School  Board  argues  that  sex  discrimination \ndoes not include discrimination based on gender identity. \nFor support, the School Board cites Johnston v. Univer-\nsity of Pittsburgh of Commonwealth System of Higher \nEducation, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2015 WL 1497753 (W.D. \nPa. Mar. 31, 2015). In Johnston, the Western District of \nPennsylvania found that a policy separating the bath-\nrooms by birth sex at the University of Pittsburgh did \nnot violate Title IX because sex discrimination does not \ninclude  discrimination  against  transgender  individuals. \n2015 WL 1497753, at *12–19. The School Board asserts \nthat Johnston establishes that Title IX does not incorpo-\nrate discrimination based on gender or transgender sta-\ntus. \nIn response, G.G. maintains that sex discrimination \nincludes discrimination based on gender. G.G. cites to a \nnumber of Title VII cases in which courts have found sex \ndiscrimination to include gender discrimination. See, e.g., \nGlenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011); \nSmith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 574–75 (6th Cir. \n2004); Finkle v. Howard Cnty., Md., 12 F. Supp. 3d 780, \n788 (D. Md. 2014); Lopez v. River Oaks Imaging & Di-\nagnostic Grp., Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 653, 660 (S.D. Tex. \n2008); see also Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201 \n(9th  Cir.  2000)  (“ ‘[S]ex’  under  Title  VII  encompasses \nboth  sex—that  is,  the  biological  differences  between \nmen and women—and gender.”).  \n \n \n\n95a \n \n \nIn addition, G.G. contends that the cases Johnston \ncited to support its proposition, Ulane v. E. Airlines, \nInc.,  742  F.2d  1081  (7th  Cir.  1984),  and,  Sommers  v. \nBudget Mktg., Inc., 667 F.2d 748 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. \ndenied, 471 U.S. 1017 (1985),5 are no longer good law. In \nboth Ulane and Sommers, the courts refused to extend \nsex  discrimination  to  include  discrimination  against \ntransgender  individuals  or  those  with  nonconforming \ngender types. However, G.G. asserts that Price Water-\nhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), overruled these \ncases. In Price Waterhouse, the Supreme Court consid-\nered a Title VII claim based on allegations that an em-\nployee at Price Waterhouse was denied partnership be-\ncause  she  was  considered  “macho”  and  “overcompen-\nsated for being a woman.” 490 U.S. at 235. She had been \nadvised to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, \ndress  more  femininely,  wear  make-up,  have  her  hair \nstyled, and wear jewelry.” Id. The Court found that such \ncomments were indicative of gender stereotyping, which \nTitle VII prohibited as sex discrimination. The Court ex-\nplained that  \nwe are beyond the day when an employer could \nevaluate  employees  by  assuming  or  insisting \n                                                   \n5 The more recent case Johnston cites is a Tenth Circuit case, in \nwhich the court avoided deciding the issue. Etsitty v. Utah Transit \nAuth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir. 2007) (“This court need not \ndecide whether discrimination based on an employee’s failure to con-\nform to sex stereotypes always constitutes discrimination ‘because \nof sex’ and we need not decide whether such a claim may extend Ti-\ntle VII protection to transsexuals who act and appear as a member \nof the opposite sex.”). \n\n96a \n \nthat  they  matched  the  stereotype  associated \nwith their group, for ‘[i]n forbidding employers \nto discriminate against individuals because of \ntheir sex, Congress intended to strike at the \nentire spectrum of disparate treatment of men \nand women resulting from sex stereotypes.’  \nId. at 251 (quoting L.A. Dept. of Water & Power v. Man-\nhart,  435  U.S.  702,  707  n.13  (1978)).  Accordingly,  the \nCourt found that “an employer who acts on the basis of a \nbelief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she \nmust not be” has acted on the basis of sex. Id. at 251.  \nOther courts have found that Price Waterhouse over-\nruled the cases cited in Johnston. “[S]ince the decision in \nPrice Waterhouse, federal courts have recognized with \nnear-total uniformity that ‘the approach in . . . Sommers, \nand  Ulane  . . .  has  been  eviscerated’  by  Price  Water-\nhouse’s holding.” Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1318 n.5 (quoting \nCity of Salem, 378 F.3d at 573)); see also Schwenk, 204 \nF.3d at 1201 (“The initial judicial approach taken in cases \nsuch as Hollowav has been overruled by the logic and \nlanguage of Price Waterhouse.”); Lopez, 542 F. Supp. 2d \nat 660. Based on Price Waterhouse and its progeny, G.G. \nclaims that discrimination against transgender individu-\nals or other nonconforming gender types is now prohib-\nited as a form of sex discrimination. Accordingly, G.G. \nasserts  that  the  Resolution’s  differentiation  between \nstudents  who  have  a  gender  identity  congruent  with \ntheir birth sex, and those who do not, amounts to sex dis-\ncrimination under Title IX.  \n \n\n97a \n \n2. Analysis \n \nAlthough the primary contention between the parties \nis whether gender discrimination fits within the defini-\ntion of sex discrimination under Title IX, G.G.’s claim \ndoes not rest on this distinction. Rather, the Court con-\ncludes  that  G.G.’s  Title  IX  claim  is  precluded  by  De-\npartment of Education regulations. As noted above, Title \nIX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Fed-\neral financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. However, \nthis  prohibition  on  sex-based  decision  making  is  not \nwithout exceptions. Among the exceptions listed in Title \nIX is a provision stating that “nothing contained herein \nshall be construed to prohibit any educational institution \nreceiving funds under this Act, from maintaining sepa-\nrate living facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686.  Although  the  statute  does  not  expressly  state \nthat  educational  institutions  may  maintain  separate \nbathrooms for the different sexes, Department of Educa-\ntion regulations stipulate:  \nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut such facilities provided for students of one \nsex shall be comparable to such facilities pro-\nvided for students of the other sex.  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33. This regulation (hereinafter, “Section \n106.33”)  expressly  allows  schools  to  provide  separate \nbathroom facilities based upon sex, so long as the bath-\nrooms  are  comparable.  When  Congress  delegates  au-\nthority to any agency to “elucidate a specific provision of \n\n98a \n \nthe statute by regulation, any ensuing regulation is bind-\ning on the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary \nor capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the \nstatute.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 227 \n(2001). The Department of Education’s regulation is not \n“arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the stat-\nute.”6 Rather, Section 106.33 seems to effectuate Title \nIX’s provision allowing separate living facilities based on \nsex.7  Therefore,  Section  106.33  is  given  controlling \nweight. \nIn light of Section 106.33, G.G. fails to state a valid \nclaim under Title IX. G.G. alleges that the School Board \nviolated Title IX by preventing him from using the boys’ \nrestrooms  despite  the  fact  that  his  gender  identity  is \nmale. Compl. ¶¶ 64, 65. According to G.G., the School \nBoard’s  determination  was  based  on  the  belief  that \nPlaintiff is biologically female, not biologically male.8 Id. \n                                                   \n6 It is significant that neither party raised, nor even hinted at rais-\ning, a challenge to the validity of Section 106.33 under Title IX.  \n7 The term “living facilities” in 20 U.S.C. § 1686 is ambiguous, and \nlegislative history of Title IX does not provide clear guidance as to \nits meaning. This term could be narrowly interpreted to mean living \nquarters, such as dormitories, or it could be broadly interpreted to \ninclude other facilities, such as bathrooms. See Implementing Title \nIX: The New Regulations, 124 U. Pa. L. Rev. 806, 811 (1976). Be-\ncause the Department of Education’s inclusion of bathrooms within \n“living facilities” is reasonable, the Court defers to its interpreta-\ntion. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 \nU.S. 837, 842–44 (1984). \n8 The Court is sensitive to the fact the G.G. disapproves of the \nSchool Board’s term “biological gender.” See Compl. ¶ 66 (placing \nbiological in dismissive quotation marks). G.G. may also take issue \nwith the Court’s phrase biological sex. The Court is guided in its \nusage by the APA “Definition of Terms: Sex, Gender, Gender Iden-\nContinued … \n\n99a \n \n¶ 65. However, Section 106.33 specifically allows schools \nto maintain separate bathrooms based on sex as long as \nthe bathrooms for each sex are comparable. Therefore, \nthe School Board did not run afoul of Title IX by limiting \nG.G. to the bathrooms assigned to his birth sex.  \nIn fact, the only way to square G.G.’s allegations with \nSection 106.33 is to interpret the use of the term “sex” in \nSection 106.33 to mean only “gender identity.” Under \nthis interpretation, Section 106.33 would permit the use \nof separate bathrooms on the basis of gender identity \nand not on the basis of birth or biological sex. However, \nunder any fair reading, “sex” in Section 106.33 clearly \nincludes biological sex. Because the School Board’s poli-\ncy of providing separate bathrooms on the basis of bio-\nlogical sex is permissible under the regulation, the Court \nneed not decide whether “sex” in the Section 106.33 also \nincludes “gender identity.” \nInstead,  the  Court  need  only  decide  whether  the \nSchool Board’s bathroom policy satisfies Section 106.33. \nSection 106.33 states that sex-segregated bathrooms are \npermissible  unless  such  facilities  are  not  comparable. \nG.G. fails to allege that the bathrooms to which he is al-\nlowed access by the School Board—the girls’ restrooms \nand  the  single-stall  restrooms—are  incomparable  to \nthose provided for individuals who are biologically male. \nIn fact, none of the allegations in the Complaint even \n                                                                                                        \ntity, Sexual Orientation” from 2011, which the School Board submit-\nted with its Brief in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunc-\ntion. Ex. 3, ECF No. 30. The APA defines “sex” as “a person’s bio-\nlogical status,” and identifies “a number of indicators of biological \nsex.” Id.  \n \n\n100a \n \nmention or imply that the facilities in the bathrooms are \nnot comparable. Consequently, G.G. fails to state a claim \nunder Title IX. \nNonetheless, despite Section 106.33, the Government \nurges the Court to defer to the Department of Educa-\ntion’s interpretation of Title IX, which maintains that a \npolicy that segregates bathrooms based on biological sex \nand without regard for students’ gender identities vio-\nlates Title IX. In support of its position, the Government \nattaches a letter (the “Letter”), dated January 7, 2015, \nissued by the Department of Education, through the Of-\nfice for Civil Rights, apparently clarifying its stance on \nthe treatment of transgender students with regard to \nsex-segregated restrooms. Statement of Interest 9, ECF \nNo. 28; id. Ex. B, at 2, ECF No. 28-2. In the Letter, the \nActing  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Policy  for  the \nDepartment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, writes:  \nThe Department’s Title IX regulations permit \nschools  to  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms, \nlocker rooms, shower facilities, housing, athlet-\nic teams, and single-sex classes under certain \ncircumstances. When a school elects to sepa-\nrate or treat students differently on the basis \nof sex in those situations, a school must treat \ntransgender  students  consistent  with  their \ngender identity.  \nId. at 9–10, Ex. B, at 2. The Letter cites a Department of \nEducation significant guidance document (the “Guidance \nDocument”) published in 2014 in support of this inter-\npretation. According to the Guidance Document:  \nUnder  Title  IX,  a  recipient  must  generally \ntreat  transgender  students  consistent  with \n\n101a \n \ntheir gender identity in all aspects of the plan-\nning,  implementation,  enrollment,  operation, \nand evaluation of single-sex classes.  \nSee Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex El-\nementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular \nActivities 25 (Dec. 1, 2014). Despite the fact that Section \n106.33 has been in effect since 1975,9 the Department of \nEducation does not cite any documents published before \n2014 to support the interpretation it now adopts.  \nThe Department of Education’s interpretation does \nnot stand up to scrutiny. Unlike regulations, interpreta-\ntions in opinion letters, policy statements, agency manu-\nals, and enforcement guidelines “do not warrant Chev-\nron-style deference” with regard to statutes. Christen-\nsen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000). Therefore, \nthe interpretations in the Letter and the Guidance Doc-\nument  cannot  supplant  Section  106.33.  Nonetheless, \nthese  documents  can  inform  the  meaning  of  Section \n106.33. An agency’s interpretation of its own regulation, \neven one contained in an opinion letter or a guidance \ndocument, is given controlling weight if (1) the regulation \nis ambiguous and (2) the interpretation is not plainly er-\nroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. Id. at 588 \n(“Auer deference is warranted only when the language \nof the regulation is ambiguous.”); Auer v. Robbins, 519 \n                                                   \n9  Title  IX  regulations  were  promulgated  by  the  Department  of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare in 1975 and adopted by the De-\npartment of Education upon its establishment in 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. \n30802, 30955 (May, 9, 1980) (codified at 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.1–.71).  \n \n\n102a \n \nU.S. 452, 461 (1997) (“[The agency’s] interpretation of \n[its own regulation] is, under our jurisprudence, control-\nling  unless  plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation.”).  \nUpon review, the Department of Education’s inter-\npretation  should  not  be  given  controlling  weight.  To \nbegin with, Section 106.33 is not ambiguous. It clearly \nallows the School Board to limit bathroom access “on the \nbasis of sex,” including birth or biological sex. Further-\nmore, the Department of Education’s interpretation of \nSection 106.33 is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with \nthe regulation. Even under the most liberal reading, “on \nthe basis of sex” in Section 106.33 means both “on the \nbasis of gender” and “on the basis of biological sex.” It \ndoes not mean “only on the basis of gender.” Indeed, the \nGovernment itself states that “under Price Waterhouse, \n‘sex’ . . . encompasses both sex—that is, the biological \ndifferences  between  men  and  women—and  gender.” \nStatement of Interest 6–7, ECF No. 28. Thus, at most, \nSection 106.33 allows the separation of bathroom facili-\nties on the basis of gender. It does not, however, require \nthat sex-segregated bathrooms be separated on the basis \nof gender, rather than on the basis of birth or biological \nsex. Gender discrimination did not suddenly supplant sex \ndiscrimination as a result of Price Waterhouse; it sup-\nplemented it.  \nTo defer to the Department of Education’s newfound \ninterpretation would be nothing less than to allow the \nDepartment of Education to “create de facto a new regu-\nlation” through the use of a mere letter and guidance \ndocument. See Christensen, 529 U.S. at 588. If the De-\npartment of Education wishes to amend its regulations, \nit is of course entitled to do so. However, it must go \n\n103a \n \nthrough notice and comment rulemaking, as required by \nthe Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. It \nwill not be permitted to disinterpret its own regulations \nfor  the  purposes  of  litigation.  As  the  Court  noted \nthroughout the hearing, it is concerned about the impli-\ncations of such rulings. Mot. to Dismiss & Prelim. Inj. \nHr’g at Tr. 65:23–66:19; 73:6–74:7. Allowing the Depart-\nment of Education’s Letter to control here would set a \nprecedent that agencies could avoid the process of for-\nmal rulemaking by announcing regulations through sim-\nple question and answer publications. Such a precedent \nwould be dangerous and could open the door to allow fur-\nther  attempts  to  circumvent  the  rule  of  law—further \ndegrading our well-designed system of checks and bal-\nances.  \nIn light of Section 106.33, the Court cannot find that \nthe School Board’s bathroom policy violates Title IX.  \n \nIII. MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nThe Motion for Preliminary Injunction is entirely dif-\nferent. The complaint is no longer the deciding factor, \nadmissible  evidence  is  the  deciding  factor.  Evidence \ntherefore must conform to the rules of evidence. G.G. has \nsought a preliminary injunction. This Motion requests \nthat the Court issue an injunction allowing G.G. to re-\nsume  using  the  boys’  restrooms  at  Gloucester  High \nSchool until there is a final judgment on the merits.10 \n                                                   \n10 G.G. claims that he does not intend to use the locker room at \nschool. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 8 n.2, ECF No. 18 \n(“Prelim. Inj.”). However, the requested injunction allowing him to \nuse the male restrooms would apply to the male restroom in the \nContinued … \n\n104a \n \nECF No. 11. In support of his motion for a preliminary \ninjunction,  G.G.  has  submitted  two  declarations:  one \nfrom G.G. and another from an expert in the field of \nGender  Dysphoria.  Decl.  of  G.G,  ECF  No.  9  (“G.G. \nDecl.”); The Expert Declaration of Randi Ettner, Ph.D, \nECF No. 10 (“Ettner Decl.”). The School Board contests \nthe injunction and attaches single a declaration to its \nOpposition  to  the  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction \nfrom Troy Andersen, a member of the School Board and \nthe 2014–15 Gloucester Point District Representative for \nthe Gloucester County School Board. Decl. of Troy An-\ndersen, ECF No. 30-1 (“Andersen Decl.”). On July 27, \n2015, the parties appeared before the Court to argue this \nMotion, and both parties were given the opportunity to \nintroduce evidence supporting their respective positions. \nECF No. 47. At the hearing, neither G.G. nor the School \nBoard introduced additional evidence for support. Id.(cid:2) \nAs the Court has granted the School Board’s motion \nto dismiss as to Count II, G.G.’s claim under Title IX, it \nneed not discuss reasons for denying the Motion for Pre-\nliminary Injunction on this Count. While the Court has \nnot yet ruled on whether G.G. has stated a claim under \nthe Equal Protection Clause, the Court finds that, even if \nhe has stated a claim, G.G. has not submitted enough ev-\nidence to establish that the balance of hardships weigh in \nhis favor. Accordingly, the issuance of a preliminary in-\njunction is not warranted.  \n \n                                                                                                        \nlocker room. \n\n105a \n \nA.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n“The grant of preliminary injunctions [is] . . . an ex-\ntraordinary remedy involving the exercise of a very far-\nreaching power, which is to be applied ‘only in the lim-\nited circumstances’ which clearly demand it.” Direx Is-\nrael. Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 811 \n(4th Cir. 1992) (quoting Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. \nAir Freight. Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 800 (3d Cir. 1989)). A \nplaintiff must overcome the “uphill battle” of satisfying \neach of the four factors necessary to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction. Real Truth About Obama. Inc. v. FEC, 575 \nF.3d 342, 347 (4th Cir. 2009) (stating that the four factors \nmust  be  “satisfied  as  articulated”),  vacated  on  other \ngrounds, 559 U.S. 1089 (2010). To obtain a preliminary \ninjunction, “[p]laintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they \nare likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they will likely \nsuffer irreparable harm absent an injunction; (3) the bal-\nance of hardships weighs in their favor; and (4) the in-\njunction is in the public interest.” League of Women Vot-\ners of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236 (4th Cir. \n2014) (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008)). The failure to make a clear showing of \nany one of these four factors requires the Court to deny \nthe preliminary injunction.”11 Real Truth About Obama, \nInc., 575 F.3d at 346.  \n                                                   \n11 The parties dispute whether the injunction sought is mandatory or \nprohibitory in nature. “Whereas mandatory injunctions alter the \nstatus quo, prohibitory injunctions ‘aim to maintain the status quo \nand prevent irreparable harm while a lawsuit remains pending.’ ” \nLeague of Women Voters of N.C., 769 F.3d at 236 (quoting Pashby v. \nDelia, 709 F.3d 307, 319 (4th Cir. 2013)). There is a heightened \nstandard for mandatory injunctions. Taylor v. Freemanm 34 F.3d \nContinued … \n\n106a \n \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction does not \nbenefit from the presumption that the facts contained in \nthe complaint are true. A plaintiff must introduce evi-\ndence in support of a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nWhile oral testimony is not strictly necessary, this Court \nhas never granted a Preliminary Injunction without first \nhearing  oral  testimony.  Declarations  are  frequently \ndrafted by lawyers, and the evidence presented within \nthem is not subject to the rigors of cross examination. A \nplaintiff relying solely on such weak evidence is unlikely \nto make the clear showing required for the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction. Additionally, this Court will not \nconsider  evidence  that  would  be  inadmissible  at  trial, \nsuch as hearsay, that is contained within affidavits.  \n \nB.  ARGUMENTS  OF  THE  PARTIES  AND  FACTS  IN \nEVIDENCE \n \nG.G. characterizes the question of competing hard-\nships as “not a close question.” Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., 40, ECF No. 18 (“Prelim. Inj.”). He argues \nthat this Court must weigh “the severe, documented, and \nscientifically supported harms” that the restroom policy \ncontinues to inflict upon G.G, who has been diagnosed \nwith Gender Dysphoria, against the “School Board’s un-\nfounded  speculation  about  harms  that  might  occur  to \n                                                                                                        \n266, 270 n.2 (4th Cir. 1994) (“Mandatory preliminary injunctive re-\nlief in any circumstance is disfavored, and warranted only in the \nmost extraordinary circumstances.”). Because the Court finds that \nG.G. fails to show that a preliminary injunction is warranted even if \nthe injunction sought is prohibitory, the Court does not decide the \nissue. \n\n107a \n \nothers at some future date.” Id. The School Board by \ncontrast implores this Court to consider the safety and \nprivacy interests of all its students. Br. in Opp’n to Mot. \nfor  Prelim.  Inj.,  18,  ECF  No.  30.  It  emphasizes  that \nwhile litigation is ongoing, G.G. may use the “girls’ rest-\nroom, the three single-stall restrooms, or the restroom in \nthe nurse’s office.” Id. \n \n1. Facts and Arguments Concerning the Hard-\nship to G.G. \n \nG.G. relies on two declarations to establish the hard-\nships he would suffer should this Court deny his Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction. ECF Nos. 9, 10. G.G.’s Dec-\nlaration largely repeats the material in his complaint. \nCompare ECF Nos. 8 and 9. The Court recounts only \nthose assertions that concern the effect that G.G.’s Gen-\nder Dysphoria has had on his schooling. G.G. alleges oth-\ner harms he has suffered, such as being humiliated and \nforced to speak at the School Board hearing, G.G. Decl. \n¶ 23, but these harms are not relevant to the issuance of \nan  injunction  allowing  G.G.  to  use  the  male  restroom \nduring this litigation. Here the declaration of G.G. is a \nrecital of the allegations in the complaint and is replete \nwith inadmissible evidence including thoughts of others, \nhearsay, and suppositions. The Court recounts these al-\nlegations before analyzing their credibility. \nG.G. claims that during his freshman year, which be-\ngan in September 2013, he “experienced severe depres-\nsion and anxiety related to his untreated Gender Dys-\nphoria.” Id. ¶ 9. The depression and anxiety were so se-\nvere that G.G. did not attend school during the spring \nsemester  which  began  in  January  2014.  Id.  There  is \n\n108a \n \nnothing to corroborate that his “untreated Gender Dys-\nphoria” was the reason for his absence. In April of 2014, \nweeks before his fifteenth birthday, G.G. first informed \nhis parents that he is transgender. Id. ¶ 10. After his \nparents learned of his gender identity, G.G. began “ther-\napy with a psychologist who had experience with work-\ning with transgender patients.” Id. He claims that this \npsychologist diagnosed him with Gender Dysphoria and \nrecommended that he begin to live as a boy in all re-\nspects,  including  in  his  use  of  the  restroom.  Id.  ¶ 11. \nThere is no report or declaration from this psychologist. \nIn August 2014, G.G. and his mother informed officials at \nGloucester High School of his gender identity. Id. ¶ 15. \nAt the start of the school year, G.G. agreed to use a sep-\narate restroom in the nurse’s office. Id. ¶ 19. G.G. then \ndetermined that it “was not necessary to continue to use \nthe nurse’s restroom.” Id. He claims that he “found it \nstigmatizing to use a separate restroom.” Id.  \nOn December 9, 2014, the School Board adopted the \nrestroom policy. Id. ¶ 22. With the new transgender rest-\nroom policy, G.G. feels like he has been “stripped of [his] \nprivacy and dignity.” Id. ¶ 23. He is unwilling to use the \ngirls’ restroom because, he claims, girls and women ob-\nject to his presence there. Id. ¶ 25. Additionally, use of \nthe  girls’  restroom  would  be  incompatible  with  his \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria. Id. He claims that the \nnew unisex restrooms are not located near his classes \nand  that  only  one  of  these  restrooms  is  located  near \nwhere the single-sex restrooms are located. Id. ¶ 26. He \nrefuses to use these restrooms because “they make him \nfeel even more stigmatized and isolated than when [he] \nuse[d] the restroom in the nurse’s office.” Id. ¶ 27. He \nclaims that everyone knows that the restrooms were in-\n\n109a \n \nstalled for him. Id. Because G.G. refuses to use any of \nthe  restrooms  permitted  for  his  use,  he  has  held  his \nurine and developed urinary tract infections. Id. ¶ 28.(cid:2) \nThe Expert Declaration of Randi Ettner, Ph.D, adds \nlittle to these factual claims. Ettner is not the psycholo-\ngist who analyzed G.G. after he first told his parents he \nwas transgender; rather, he was retained by G.G.’s coun-\nsel in preparation for this litigation. See Ettner Decl. \n¶¶ 1, 7, 9. Ettner met G.G. once before preparing his re-\nport. Id. ¶ 7. The bulk of his declaration describes the \ndiagnosis and treatment of Gender Dysphoria. It defines \nGender  Dysphoria  as  the  feeling  of  incongruence  be-\ntween one’s gender identity and the sex assigned one at \nbirth.  Id.  ¶ 11–12.  It  notes  that  Gender  Dysphoria  is \n“codified in the Diagnostic and Statistical [M]anual of \nMental Disorders (DSM-V) (American Psychiatric Asso-\nciation) and the International Classifications of Diseases-\n10 (World Health Organization).” Id. ¶ 12. It describes \nthe studies that have looked at transgender youth who \ncould not use restrooms corresponding to their gender \nidentity. Id. ¶¶ 18–27. However, beyond confirming that \nG.G. has a “severe degree of Gender Dysphoria,” id. ¶ 29, \nthere are no facts particular to G.G. in the report. See id. \n¶¶ 28–30. \nThe School Board, supported by the declaration of \nTroy Andersen, emphasizes that any student may use \nthe three unisex restrooms that were installed and open \nfor use by December 16, 2014. Andersen Decl. ¶ 7; Br. in \nOpp’n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF No. 30. Any stu-\ndent may also use the restroom in the nurse’s office. An-\ndersen Decl. ¶ 7. Moreover, the School Board contends \nthat  G.G.  may  use  the  female  restrooms  and  locker \nrooms, Br. in Opp’n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF No. \n\n110a \n \n30, and G.G. has made no showing that he is not permit-\nted to use them.  \n \n2.  Facts  and  Arguments  Concerning  Student \nPrivacy \n \nThe School Board contends that granting the prelim-\ninary injunction and allowing G.G. to use the male rest-\nroom would endanger the safety and privacy of other \nstudents. Br. in Opp’n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18, ECF \nNo. 30. G.G. argues in response, without any independ-\nent factual support, that his presence in the male rest-\nroom would not infringe upon the privacy rights of his \nfellow students. He claims that the student body itself is \ncomfortable with his presence in the restroom because \nduring the seven weeks in which he used the male rest-\nroom, he “never encountered any problems from other \nstudents.” G.G. Decl. ¶ 20. The Andersen Declaration de-\nscribes a different reaction to G.G.’s use of the male rest-\nroom. Andersen Decl. ¶ 4. According to Andersen, the \nSchool  Board  “began  receiving  numerous  complaints \nfrom  parents  and  students”  the  day  after  G.G.  was \ngranted permission to use the boys’ bathroom. Id. \nG.G. also contends that the improvements that the \nSchool Board made to the restrooms alleviated any con-\ncerns that parents or students may have had about “nu-\ndity involving students of different sexes.” Prelim. Inj. at \n33. His complaint describes these improvements, which \ninclude raising the doors and walls around the bathroom \nstalls so that students cannot see into an adjoining stall, \nand adding three unisex, single-stall restrooms. Compl. \n¶¶ 47, 52. The School Board disputes the extent to which \nthe  improvements  have  increased  privacy  and  claims \n\n111a \n \nthat  the  restrooms,  “and  specifically  the  urinals,”  are \n“not completely private,” although it also does not sub-\nmit any evidence in support of this contention. Br. in \nOpp’n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., 18 n.17, ECF No. 30.  \nFinally, G.G. argues that any student uncomfortable \nwith his presence in the male restrooms may use the new \nunisex restrooms. Prelim. Inj. at 35, 39.  \n \nC.  ANALYSIS \n \nG.G.’s  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  asks  this \nCourt to allow him, a natal female, to use the male rest-\nroom at Gloucester High School. Mot. for Prelim. Inj., \nECF No. 11. Restrooms and locker rooms are designed \ndifferently because of the biological differences between \nthe sexes. See Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th \nCir. 1993) (“differences between the genders demand a \nfacility  for  each  gender that is different”).  Male rest-\nrooms, for instance, contain urinals, while female rest-\nrooms do not. Men tend to prefer urinals because of the \nconvenience. Furthermore, society demands that male \nand  female  restrooms  be  separate  because  of  privacy \nconcerns.  Id.;  see  also  Virginia  v.  United  States,  518 \nU.S. 515, 550 n.16 (1996) (“[admitting women to VMI \nwould undoubtedly require alterations necessary to af-\nford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in \nliving arrangements”). The Court must consider G.G.’s \nclaims of stigma and distress against the privacy inter-\nests of the other students protected by separate rest-\nrooms.  \nIn protecting the privacy of the other students, the \nSchool  Board  is  protecting  a  constitutional  right.  The \nFourth Circuit has recognized that prisoners have a con-\n\n112a \n \nstitutional  right  to  bodily  privacy.  Lee  v.  Downs,  641 \nF.2d  1117,  1119  (4th  Cir.  1981).  Although  the  Fourth \nCircuit has never held that the right to bodily privacy \napplies to all individuals, it would be perverse to suppose \nthat prisoners, who forfeit so many privacy rights, nev-\nertheless gained a constitutional right to bodily privacy. \nIn recognizing the right of prisoners to bodily privacy \nthe  court  spoke  in  universal  terms:  “Most  people  . . . \nhave a special sense of privacy in their own genitals, and \ninvoluntary exposure of them in the presence of people \nof the other sex may be especially demeaning and humil-\niating.” Id.  \nSeveral circuits have recognized the right to bodily \nprivacy outside the context of prisoner litigation. Doe v. \nLuzerne County, 660 F.3d 169, 177 (3d Cir. 2011) (hold-\ning that bodily exposure may meet “the lofty constitu-\ntional standard” and constitute a violation of one’s rea-\nsonable  expectation  of  privacy);  Brannum  v.  Overton \nCounty  School  Bd.,  516  F.3d  489,  494  (6th  Cir.  2008) \n(holding that a student’s “constitutionally protected right \nto privacy encompasses the right not to be videotaped \nwhile dressing and undressing in school athletic locker \nrooms”); Poe v. Leonard. 282 F.3d 123, 138–39 (2d Cir. \n2002) (“there is a right to privacy in one’s unclothed or \npartially unclothed body”); York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, \n455 (9th Cir. 1963) (“We cannot conceive of a more basic \nsubject of privacy than the naked body.”). In these cir-\ncuits, violations of the right to bodily privacy are most \nacute when one’s body is exposed to a member of the op-\nposite sex. See Doe, 660 F.3d at 177 (considering whether \n“Doe’s body parts were exposed to members of the oppo-\nsite sex” in deciding whether her reasonable expectation \nof privacy was violated); Brannum, 516 F.3d at 494 (“the \n\n113a \n \nconstitutional right to privacy . . . includes the right to \nshield one’s body from exposure to viewing by the oppo-\nsite sex”); York, 324 F.2d at 455 (highlighting that the \nexposed plaintiff was female and the viewing defendant \nmale);  Poe,  282  F.3d  at  138  (citing  with  approval  the \nNinth Circuit’s emphasis on the different genders of de-\nfendant and plaintiff in York).  \nNot only is bodily privacy a constitutional right, the \nneed for privacy is even more pronounced in the state \neducational system. The students are almost all minors, \nand public school education is a protective environment. \nFurthermore, the School Board is tasked with providing \nsafe and appropriate facilities for these students. Linnon \nv. Commonwealth, 752 S.E.2d 822, 826 (Va. 2014) (find-\ning that “school administrators have a responsibility ‘to \nsupervise and ensure that students could have an educa-\ntion in an atmosphere conducive to learning, free of dis-\nruption, and threat to person.’ ” (quoting Burns v. Gag-\nnon, 727 S.E.2d 634, 643 (Va. 2012)).  \nG.G.’s unsupported claims, which are mostly inadmis-\nsible hearsay, fail to show that his presence in the male \nrestroom would not infringe upon the privacy of other \nstudents. G.G.’s claim that he “never encountered any \nproblems from other students,” G.G. Decl. ¶ 20, is direct-\nly contradicted by the Andersen Declaration. Andersen \nDecl. ¶ 4. Moreover, even if the Court accepted G.G.’s \nself-serving assertion, it would still not find that there \nwas no discomfort among the students. It would not be \nsurprising if students, rather than confronting G.G. him-\nself,  expressed  their  discomfort  to  their  parents  who \nthen went to the School Board.(cid:2) \nG.G. further contends that the improvements that the \nSchool Board made to the restrooms minimize any priva-\n\n114a \n \ncy concerns. Prelim. Inj. at 33. However, G.G. does not \nintroduce any evidence that would help the Court under-\nstand the extent of the improvements. He fails to recog-\nnize that no amount of improvements to the urinals can \nmake them completely private because people sometimes \nturn while closing their pants. He does not submit any \nevidence that would show that other students would be \ncomfortable with his presence in the male restroom be-\ncause of the improvements. Finally, he fails to recognize \nthat the School Board’s interests go beyond preventing \nmost  exposures  of  genitalia.  The  mere  presence  of  a \nmember of the opposite sex in the restroom may embar-\nrass many students and be felt a violation of their priva-\ncy.  Accordingly,  the  privacy  concerns  of  the  School \nBoard do not diminish in proportion to the size of the \nstall doors.  \nG.G.’s argument that other students may use the uni-\nsex restrooms if they are uncomfortable with his pres-\nence in the male restroom unintentionally reveals the \nhardship that the injunction he seeks would impose on \nother students. It does not occur to G.G. that other stu-\ndents may experience feelings of exclusion when they \ncan no longer use the restrooms they were accustomed \nto using because they feel that G.G.’s presence in the \nmale restroom violates their privacy. He would have any \nnumber of students use the unisex restrooms rather than \nuse them himself while this Court resolves his novel con-\nstitutional challenge. \nG.G.’s dismissal of the School Board’s privacy con-\ncerns only makes sense if assumes that there are fewer \nor no privacy concerns when a student shares a restroom \nwith another student of different birth sex but the same \ngender identity. If there were no privacy concerns in this \n\n115a \n \nsituation, there would be no hardship if G.G. used the \nmale restroom while this litigation proceeds. Of course, \nthis litigation is proof that not everyone—certainly not \nthe Gloucester County School Board—shares in this be-\nlief. The Court gives great weight to the concerns of the \nSchool Board—which represents the students and par-\nents in the community—on the question of the privacy \nconcerns of students, especially at this early stage of liti-\ngation and in the complete absence of credible evidence \nto the contrary. \nAgainst the School Board’s strong interest in protect-\ning  student  privacy,  the  Court  must  consider  G.G.’s \nlargely  unsubstantiated  claims  of  hardship.  G.G. \nacknowledges that he may use the unisex restrooms or \nthe nurse’s restroom. His declaration fails to articulate \nthe specific harms that would occur to him if he uses \nthose restrooms while this litigation proceeds; it simply \nsays that using these restrooms would cause him dis-\ntress and make him feel stigmatized. It is telling to the \nCourt that his declaration mirrors his complaint, a sign \nthat it was drafted by his lawyers and not by him. G.G. \nattempts to support his claims of distress by describing \nthe diagnosis of the first psychologist who saw him, but \nthese allegations are hearsay and will not be considered.  \nSimilarly,  G.G.  makes  several  claims  about  the \nthoughts and feelings of other students for which he has \nnot submitted any admissible evidence or corroboration. \nHe has nothing to substantiate his claims that other stu-\ndents view the unisex restrooms as designed solely for \nhim. Nor has he submitted a layout of the school that \nwould confirm his claim that the unisex restrooms are \ninconvenient for him to use. \n\n116a \n \nThe declaration of Dr. Ettner is almost completely \ndevoid of facts specific to G.G. Dr. Ettner is not the psy-\nchologist who allegedly first diagnosed G.G. with Gender \nDysphoria. Rather, he has been retained for this litiga-\ntion.  Having  met  G.G.  only  once,  he  has  little  to  say \nabout the harm that would occur to G.G. specifically if \nG.G. is not allowed to use the male restrooms during this \nlitigation. \nG.G. has been given an option of using a restroom in \naddition to the female restroom that corresponds to his \nbiological sex. He has not described his hardship in con-\ncrete terms and has supported his claims with nothing \nmore than his own declaration and that of a psychologist \nwho met him only once, for the purpose of litigation and \nnot for treatment. The School Board seeks to protect an \ninterest in bodily privacy that the Fourth Circuit has \nrecognized as a constitutional right while G.G. seeks to \noverturn  a  long  tradition  of  segregating  bathrooms \nbased on biological differences between the sexes. Be-\ncause G.G. has failed to show that the balance of hard-\nships weighs in his favor, an injunction is not warranted \nwhile the Court considers this claim. \nHaving found that G.G. has not shown that the bal-\nance of the hardships are in his favor, the Court docs not \nneed to consider the other showings required for a pre-\nliminary injunction. However, the Court notes that just \nas G.G. has failed to provide adequate proof of the hard-\nship that would occur if the injunction is not granted, he \nhas also failed to make a clear showing of irreparable in-\njury. \n \n\n117a \n \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTED the \nMotion to Dismiss as to Count II, Plaintiff’s claim under \nTitle IX, and DENIED the Plaintiffs Motion for a Pre-\nliminary Injunction.

In response to the presence of a transgender \nstudent in the local high school, the school board passed \nthe following proposal, establishing it as official policy \nfor Gloucester County Public Schools: \nWhereas the GCPS (Gloucester County Public \nSchools) recognizes that some students ques-\ntion their gender identities, and \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students \nto seek support and advice from parents, pro-\nfessionals and other trusted adults, and \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide \nmale and female restroom and locker room fa-\ncilities in its schools, and the use of said facili-\nties shall be limited to the corresponding bio-\nlogical genders, and students with sincere gen-\nder identity issues shall be provided an alter-\nnative private facility. \n\n119a \n \nThe U.S. Department of Education has recently received \npraise  from  the  transgender  community  for  noting  in \nseveral guidance documents that Title IX’s ban on dis-\ncrimination on the basis of sex includes, consistent with \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s deci-\nsion in Macy v. Holder, discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity. It is my sincere hope that the Depart-\nment will continue to provide such guidance, particularly \non this issue that so frequently erupts whenever states \nor localities consider prohibiting discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity. \nWhile I understand that the Department is unable to \ncomment on any matters that may be under investiga-\ntion, this story does raise a question: does the Depart-\nment have any guidance or rules for what is or is not ac-\nceptable for a school to do when establishing policies for \ntransgender students to access restrooms and other sim-\nilar  sex-segregated  facilities?  Specifically,  the  articles \nlead the reader to a number of questions: \n•  Does the Department have guidance or rules \non  whether  a  transgender  student  may  be \nrequired  to  use  a  different  restroom  than \nother  students,  such  as  a  restroom  in  a \nnurse’s office or a restroom designated for \nschool employees? \n•  Does the Department have guidance or rules \non  whether  an  organization  (cid:2)such  as  a \nschool, a school district, or a university may \nlimit access to facilities to only those whose \ngender identity is consistent with their sex \nassigned at birth (i.e., cisgender individuals)? \n\n120a \n \n•  Has  the  Department  communicated  any \nguidance or rules on these questions to or-\nganizations such as schools, school districts, \nor universities to eliminate unnecessary con-\nfusion  over  proper  implementation  of  Title \nIX? \n \nI have copied one of the writers, Ms. Barbara King, a \ncontributor to NPR and Chancellor Professor of Anthro-\npology at the College of William and Mary, who wrote \nabout the topic in an NPR blog post on December 11, \n2014. I will gladly share your response with the authors \nof the other news stories I have seen on this issue, such \nas Dominic Holden of BuzzFeed and John Riley of Metro \nWeekly. \nI look forward to working with your office to answer \nthese questions. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n/s/ Emily T.

In your letter, you \nmentioned statements in recent guidance documents is-\nsued by the Department concerning the application of \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) \nto gender identity discrimination. In addition, you identi-\nfied a particular school district’s policy about access to \nrestrooms and asked about the existence and distribu-\ntion of any guidance by the Department about policies or \npractices regarding transgender students’ access to rest-\nrooms.  Your  letter  has  been  referred  to  the  Depart-\nment’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and I am happy to \nrespond. \nAs you know, OCR’s mission includes enforcing Title \nIX, which prohibits recipients of Federal financial assis-\ntance from discriminating on the basis of sex, including \ngender identity and failure to conform to stereotypical \nnotions of masculinity or femininity.1 OCR enforces and \n                                                   \n1 See OCR’s April 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sex-\nual  Violence  at  B-2,  http://www2.ed.gov/about/officcs/list/ocr/ \ndocs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf. \n\n122a \n \ninterprets Title IX consistent with case law,2 and with \nthe adjudications and guidance documents of other Fed-\neral agencies.3 \n                                                   \n2 See, e.g., Price Waterhouse v.

In recent years, we have \nreceived an increasing number of questions from par-\nents,  teachers,  principals,  and  school  superintendents \nabout civil rights protections for transgender students. \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) \nand its implementing regulations prohibit sex discrimi-\nnation in educational programs and activities operated \nby recipients of Federal financial assistance.1 This prohi-\nbition encompasses discrimination based on a student’s \ngender identity, including discrimination based on a stu-\ndent’s  transgender  status.  This  letter  summarizes  a \nschool’s Title IX obligations regarding transgender stu-\ndents and explains how the U.S. Department of Educa-\n                                                   \n1 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688; 34 C.F.R. Pt. 106; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 54. In this \nletter, the term schools refers to recipients of Federal financial as-\nsistance at all educational levels, including school districts, colleges, \nand universities. An educational institution that is controlled by a \nreligious organization is exempt from Title IX to the extent that \ncompliance would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such \norganization. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3); 34 C.F.R. § 106.12(a).  \n\n127a \n \ntion  (ED)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ) \nevaluate a school’s compliance with these obligations.  \nED  and  DOJ  (the  Departments)  have  determined \nthat  this  letter  is  significant  guidance.2  This  guidance \ndoes not add requirements to applicable law, but pro-\nvides  information  and  examples  to  inform  recipients \nabout how the Departments evaluate whether covered \nentities are complying with their legal obligations.

The examples in that \ndocument are taken from policies that school districts, \nstate education agencies, and high school athletics asso-\nciations around the country have adopted to help ensure \nthat transgender students enjoy a supportive and non-\ndiscriminatory school environment.

A person’s gender identity may \nbe different from or the same as the person’s sex \nassigned at birth. (cid:2) \n \n•  Sex assigned at birth refers to the sex designation \nrecorded  on  an  infant’s  birth  certificate  should \nsuch a record be provided at birth. (cid:2) \n \n•  Transgender  describes  those  individuals  whose \ngender  identity  is  different  from  the  sex  they \nwere  assigned  at  birth.  A  transgender  male  is \nsomeone who identifies as male but was assigned \nthe sex of female at birth; a transgender female is \nsomeone  who  identifies  as  female  but  was  as-\nsigned the sex of male at birth. (cid:2) \n \n•  Gender transition refers to the process in which \ntransgender individuals begin asserting the sex \nthat corresponds to their gender identity instead \nof the sex they were assigned at birth. During \ngender  transition,  individuals  begin  to  live  and \nidentify as the sex consistent with their gender \nidentity and may dress differently, adopt a new \nname,  and  use  pronouns  consistent  with  their \ngender identity. Transgender individuals may un-\n                                                                                                        \nfy examples of ways OCR and recipients have resolved some issues \naddressed in this guidance.  \n\n129a \n \ndergo gender transition at any stage of their lives, \nand gender transition can happen swiftly or over \na long duration of time.  \n \nCompliance with Title IX \n \nAs a condition of receiving Federal funds, a school \nagrees that it will not exclude, separate, deny benefits to, \nor otherwise treat differently on the basis of sex any per-\nson in its educational programs or activities unless ex-\npressly authorized to do so under Title IX or its imple-\nmenting regulations.4 The Departments treat a student’s \ngender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title \nIX and its implementing regulations. This means that a \nschool must not treat a transgender student differently \nfrom the way it treats other students of the same gender \nidentity. The Departments’ interpretation is consistent \nwith courts’ and other agencies’ interpretations of Fed-\neral laws prohibiting sex discrimination.5 \n                                                   \n4 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.4, 106.31(a). For simplicity, this letter cites only to \nED’s Title IX regulations. DOJ has also promulgated Title IX regu-\nlations. See 28 C.F.R. Pt. 54. For purposes of how the Title IX regu-\nlations at issue in this guidance apply to transgender individuals, \nDOJ interprets its regulations similarly to ED. State and local rules \ncannot limit or override the requirements of Federal laws. See 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.6(b). \n5 See, e.g., Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989); Oncale \nv.

As is consistently recognized in civil \nrights cases, the desire to accommodate others’ discom-\nfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disad-\nvantages a particular class of students.8 \n                                                   \n7 See G.G., 2016 WL 1567467, at *1 n.1 (noting that medical authori-\nties “do not permit sex reassignment surgery for persons who are \nunder the legal age of majority”). \n8 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(4); see G.G., 2016 WL 1567467, at *8 & n.10 \n(affirming that individuals have legitimate and important privacy \ninterests and noting that these interests do not inherently conflict \nwith nondiscrimination principles); Cruzan v.

Identification  Documents,  Names,  and  \nPronouns \n \nUnder Title IX, a school must treat students con-\nsistent with their gender identity even if their education \nrecords or identification documents indicate a different \nsex. The Departments have resolved Title IX investiga-\ntions with agreements committing that school staff and \ncontractors will use pronouns and names consistent with \na transgender student’s gender identity.11 \n \n                                                   \n10 See, e.g., OCR, Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harass-\nment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third \nParties (2001), www.ed.gov/ocr/docs/shguide.pdf; OCR, Dear Col-\nleague  Letter:  Harassment  and  Bullying  (Oct.  26,  2010), \nwww.ed.gov/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf; OCR, Dear Colleague \nLetter:  Sexual  Violence  (Apr.  4,  2011),  www.ed.gov/ocr/letters/ \ncolleague-201104.pdf; OCR, Questions and Answers on Title IX and \nSexual  Violence  (Apr.  29,  2014),  www.ed.gov/ocr/docs/qa-201404-\ntitle-ix.pdf. \n11 See, e.g., Resolution Agreement, In re Cent.

Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities \n \nTitle IX’s implementing regulations permit a school \nto  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms,  locker  rooms, \nshower facilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well as \nsingle-sex classes under certain circumstances.12 When a \nschool provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, \ntransgender students must be allowed to participate in \nsuch activities and access such facilities consistent with \ntheir gender identity.13 \n \n•  Restrooms  and  Locker  Rooms.  A  school  may \nprovide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but \nmust allow transgender students access to such \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity.14 A \nschool may not require transgender students to \nuse facilities inconsistent with their gender identi-\nty or to use individual-user facilities when other \nstudents are not required to do so. A school may, \nhowever,  make  individual-user  options  available \nto  all  students  who  voluntarily  seek  additional \nprivacy.15 \n                                                   \n12 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32, 106.33, 106.34, 106.41(b).  \n13 See 34 C.F.R. § 106.31.(cid:2) \n14 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \n15 See, e.g., Resolution Agreement, In re Township High Sch.

Title IX regulations permit a school to \noperate or sponsor sex-segregated athletics teams \nwhen selection for such teams is based upon com-\npetitive  skill  or  when  the  activity  involved  is  a \ncontact sport.16 A school may not, however, adopt \nor  adhere  to  requirements  that  rely  on  overly \nbroad  generalizations  or  stereotypes  about  the \ndifferences  between  transgender  students  and \nother  students  of  the  same  sex  (i.e.,  the  same \ngender  identity)  or  others’  discomfort  with \ntransgender students.17 Title IX does not prohibit \nage-appropriate, tailored requirements based on \nsound,  current,  and  research-based  medical \nknowledge about the impact of the students’ par-\nticipation on the competitive fairness or physical \nsafety of the sport.18 \n                                                                                                        \nnearby private area (such as a single-use facility); or a separate \nschedule of use.”). \n16 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b). Nothing in Title IX prohibits schools from \noffering coeducational athletic opportunities.  \n17 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(b), (c). An interscholastic athletic association is \nsubject to Title IX if (1) the association receives Federal financial \nassistance or (2) its members are recipients of Federal financial as-\nsistance and have ceded controlling authority over portions of their \nathletic program to the association. Where an athletic association is \ncovered by Title IX, a school’s obligations regarding transgender \nathletes apply with equal force to the association.  \n18 The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), for exam-\nple,  reported  that  in  developing  its  policy  for  participation  by \ntransgender students in college athletics, it consulted with medical \nexperts, athletics officials, affected students, and a consensus report \nentitled On the Team: Equal Opportunity for Transgender Student \nContinued … \n\n136a \n \n \n•  Single-Sex  Classes.  Although  separating  stu-\ndents by sex in classes and activities is generally \nprohibited, nonvocational elementary and second-\nary  schools  may  offer  nonvocational  single-sex \nclasses and extracurricular activities under cer-\ntain circumstances.19 When offering such classes \nand  activities,  a  school  must  allow  transgender \nstudents to participate consistent with their gen-\nder identity. (cid:2) \n  \n•  Single-Sex Schools. Title IX does not apply to \nthe admissions policies of certain educational in-\nstitutions,  including  nonvocational  elementary \nand secondary schools, and private undergradu-\nate colleges.20 Those schools are therefore permit-\n                                                                                                        \nAthletes (2010) by Dr. Pat Griffin & Helen J.

The On the Team report noted that policies that \nmay be appropriate at the college level may “be unfair and too com-\nplicated for [the high school] level of competition.” On the Team at \n26. After engaging in similar processes, some state interscholastic \nathletics  associations  have  adopted  policies  for  participation  by \ntransgender students in high school athletics that they determined \nwere age-appropriate.  \n19 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(a), (b). Schools may also separate students by \nsex in physical education classes during participation in contact \nsports.

Nothing in Title IX prohibits a \nprivate undergraduate women’s college from ad-\nmitting transgender women if it so chooses.  \n \n•  Social Fraternities and Sororities. Title IX does \nnot apply to the membership practices of social \nfraternities and sororities.21 Those organizations \nare  therefore  permitted  under  Title  IX  to  set \ntheir  own  policies  regarding  the  sex,  including \ngender identity, of their members. Nothing in Ti-\ntle  IX  prohibits  a  fraternity  from  admitting \ntransgender  men  or  a  sorority  from  admitting \ntransgender women if it so chooses.  \n \n•  Housing and Overnight Accommodations. Title \nIX allows a school to provide separate housing on \nthe  basis  of  sex.22  But  a  school  must  allow \ntransgender students to access housing consistent \nwith their gender identity and may not require \ntransgender students to stay in single-occupancy \naccommodations  or  to  disclose  personal  infor-\nmation  when  not  required  of  other  students. \nNothing in Title IX prohibits a school from honor-\ning  a  student’s  voluntary  request  for  single-\noccupancy accommodations if it so chooses.23 \n                                                                                                        \nsex  a  “substantially  equal  single-sex  school  or  coeducational \nschool”). \n21 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 106.14(a).  \n22 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.32.  \n23 See, e.g., Resolution Agreement, In re Arcadia Unified. Sch. Dist., \nContinued … \n\n138a \n \n  \n•  Other Sex-Specific Activities and Rules. Unless \nexpressly authorized by Title IX or its implement-\ning  regulations,  a  school  may  not  segregate  or \notherwise  distinguish  students  on  the  basis  of \ntheir sex, including gender identity, in any school \nactivities  or  the  application  of  any  school  rule. \nLikewise, a school may not discipline students or \nexclude them from participating in activities for \nappearing or behaving in a manner that is con-\nsistent with their gender identity or that does not \nconform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or \nfemininity  (e.g.,  in  yearbook  photographs,  at \nschool dances, or at graduation ceremonies).24 \n \n4. Privacy and Education Records \n \nProtecting transgender students’ privacy is critical to \nensuring they are treated consistent with their gender \nidentity. The Departments may find a Title IX violation \nwhen a school limits students’ educational rights or op-\nportunities by failing to take reasonable steps to protect \nstudents’ privacy related to their transgender status, in-\n                                                                                                        \nCA, OCR Case No. 09-12-1020, DOJ Case No. 169-12C-70, (July 24, \n2013),  www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2013/07/26/ \narcadiaagree.pdf (agreement to provide access to single-sex over-\nnight events consistent with students’ gender identity, but allowing \nstudents to request access to private facilities).  \n24 See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31(a), 106.31(b)(4).

FERPA gen-\nerally  prevents  the  nonconsensual  disclosure  of \nPII from a student’s education records; one ex-\nception is that records may be disclosed to indi-\nvidual  school  personnel  who  have  been  deter-\nmined to have a legitimate educational interest in \nthe information.27 Even when a student has dis-\nclosed the student’s transgender status to some \nmembers of the school community, schools may \nnot rely on this FERPA exception to disclose PII \nfrom education records to other school personnel \nwho do not have a legitimate educational interest \nin the information. Inappropriately disclosing (or \nrequiring  students  or  their  parents  to  disclose) \nPII from education records to the school commu-\nnity  may  violate  FERPA  and  interfere  with \n                                                   \n25 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(7).(cid:2) \n26 20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R.

Under \nFERPA’s implementing regulations, a school may \ndisclose  appropriately  designated  directory  in-\nformation  from  a  student’s  education  record  if \ndisclosure  would  not  generally  be  considered \nharmful or an invasion of privacy.28 Directory in-\nformation may include a student’s name, address, \ntelephone number, date and place of birth, honors \nand awards, and dates of attendance.29 School of-\nficials may not designate students’ sex, including \ntransgender status, as directory information be-\ncause doing so could be harmful or an invasion of \nprivacy.30 A school also must allow eligible stu-\ndents (i.e., students who have reached 18 years of \nage or are attending a postsecondary institution) \nor parents, as appropriate, a reasonable amount \nof time to request that the school not disclose a \nstudent’s directory information.31 \n  \n•  Amendment or Correction of Education Rec-\nords.

If, after the hearing, the \nschool does not amend the record, it must in-\nform  the  requestor  of  the  right  to  insert  a \nstatement in the record with the requestor’s \ncomments  on  the  contested  information,  a \nstatement that the requestor disagrees with \nthe hearing decision, or both. That statement \nmust  be  disclosed  whenever  the  record  to \nwhich the statement relates is disclosed.33  \n§  Under Title IX, a school must respond to a re-\nquest to amend information related to a stu-\ndent’s transgender status consistent with its \ngeneral practices for amending other students’ \nrecords.34  If  a  student  or  parent  complains \n                                                   \n32 34 C.F.R. § 99.20.(cid:2) \n33 34 C.F.R. §§ 99.20–99.22.(cid:2) \n34 See 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(4).  \n\n142a \n \nabout the school’s handling of such a request, \nthe  school  must  promptly  and  equitably  re-\nsolve the complaint under the school’s Title IX \ngrievance procedures.35  \n \n* * * \n \nWe  appreciate  the  work  that  many  schools,  state \nagencies,  and  other  organizations  have  undertaken  to \nmake  educational  programs  and  activities  welcoming, \nsafe, and inclusive for all students.  \n \nSincerely, \n \n/s/ \nCatherine E.

Case No. 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-TEM \n \nGLOUCESTER COUNTY SCHOOL  \nBOARD,  \n \nDefendant.  \n \nDECLARATION OF TROY M. ANDERSEN \n \nOn this 7th day of July 2015, I, Troy M. Andersen, \nmake  the  following  declaration  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1746:(cid:2) \n1. I am over the age of eighteen, suffer no legal disa-\nbilities, have personal knowledge of the facts set forth \nbelow, and am competent to testify. \n2. I am the Gloucester Point District Representative \nfor  the  Gloucester  County  School  Board  (“the  School \nBoard” or “GCSB”), and I served in that capacity during \nthe 2014–2015 school year. I am still a member of the \nSchool Board and currently serve as its chairman.  \n3.  It  has  always  been  the  practice  of  Gloucester \nCounty Schools to separate restrooms and locker rooms \nat school facilities on the basis of the students’ biological \nsex, and this practice has been in place the entire time \n\n144a \n \nthat Plaintiff has been a student within the Gloucester \nCounty school system. It is my understanding that plain-\ntiff enrolled as a freshman at Gloucester High School for \nthe 2013–2014 school year as a female student. \n4.  While  Plaintiff  was  granted  permission  at  the \nschool  level  to  begin  using  the  boys’  restrooms  at \nGloucester High School on October 20, 2014, no decision \nwas made by the School Board until December 9, 2014. \nBeginning on October 21, 2014, the School Board began \nreceiving  numerous  complaints  from  parents  and  stu-\ndents about Plaintiff’s use of the boys’ restrooms. \n5.  On December 9, 2014, the School Board adopted a \nrestroom and locker room resolution that provided:  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  [i.e.,  Gloucester  County \nPublic Schools] recognizes that some students \nquestion their gender identities, and  \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students \nto  seek  support,  advice,  and  guidance  from \nparents, professionals and other trusted adults, \nand  \nWhereas  the  GCPS  seeks  to  provide  a  safe \nlearning environment for all students and to \nprotect the privacy of all students, therefore  \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide \nmale and female restroom and locker room fa-\ncilities in its schools, and the use of said facili-\nties shall be limited to the corresponding bio-\nlogical genders, and students with gender iden-\ntity issues shall be provided an alternative ap-\npropriate private facility.  \n\n145a \n \n6.  The restroom and locker room resolution reflects \nwhat has always been the practice of the schools. The \nresolution was developed to treat all students and situa-\ntions the same. \n7.  The School Board had three single-stall unisex \nbathrooms constructed at Gloucester High School. All \nthree  restrooms  were  open  for  use  by  December  16, \n2014. Any student can use these unisex bathrooms, re-\ngardless of their biological sex, if they are uncomfortable \nusing a communal bathroom, or for any other privacy \nreason. Students may also use a restroom located in the \nnurse’s office.  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty \nof perjury that the foregoing statements are true and \ncorrect.  \n \nExecuted on   7/7/15   (date)    /s/ Troy M.

Civil No. 4:15-cv-00054-RGD-DEM \n \nGLOUCESTER COUNTY SCHOOL  \nBOARD,  \n \nDefendant.  \n \nCORRECTED DECLARATION OF G.G. \n \n1. I am the plaintiff in the above-captioned action. I \nhave actual knowledge of the matters stated in this dec-\nlaration.  \n2. My name is G.G. (cid:2) \n3.  Several  photographs  of  me  taken  over  the  past \nyear are attached to this declaration as Exhibit A.  \n4. I was born in Gloucester County on May 4, 1999, \nand have lived in Gloucester County my entire life.  \n5. I am a student at Gloucester High School. I will \nbegin my junior year of high school in September 2015.  \n6. Although my sex assigned at birth was female, I \nwas aware at a very young age that I did not feel like a \ngirl.  I  have  always  felt  uncomfortable  wearing  “girl” \nclothes, and by the age of six, I adamantly refused to do \n\n147a \n \nso. I insisted upon buying all of my clothes in the boys’ \ndepartment.  \n7. At approximately age twelve, I acknowledged my \nmale gender identity to myself. I gradually began dis-\nclosing this fact to close friends. Since the reactions of \nmy friends were generally positive and supportive, I dis-\nclosed my gender identity to more friends.  \n8. In approximately ninth grade, most of my friends \nwere aware of my gender identity, and I lived openly as a \nboy when socializing with friends away from home and \nschool.  \n9. During my freshman year, I experienced severe \ndepression and anxiety related to my untreated Gender \nDysphoria and the stress of concealing my gender identi-\nty from my family. The depression and anxiety was so \nsevere that I could not attend school during the spring \nsemester of my freshman year. Instead, I took classes \nthrough a home-bound program that follows the public \nhigh school curriculum.  \n10.  In  April  2014,  I  told  my  parents  that  I  am \ntransgender. At my request, I began therapy with a psy-\nchologist  who  had  experience  with  working  with \ntransgender patients.  \n11. The psychologist diagnosed me with Gender Dys-\nphoria. The psychologist recommended that I immedi-\nately begin living as a boy in all respects. That included \nusing a male name and pronouns and using boys’ rest-\nrooms. The psychologist gave me a “Treatment Docu-\nmentation Letter” confirming that I am receiving treat-\nment  for  Gender  Dysphoria  and  that,  as  part  of  that \ntreatment, I should be treated as a boy in all respects, \nincluding with respect to my use of the restroom. In ad-\ndition, the psychologist recommended that I see an en-\n\n148a \n \ndocrinologist  to  begin  hormone  treatment  for  Gender \nDysphoria.  \n12. In July 2014, I petitioned the Circuit Court of \nGloucester County to change my legal name to G.G., and \nthe court granted the petition. I now use that name for \nall purposes, and my friends and family refer to me using \nmale pronouns.  \n13. I use the boys’ restrooms when out in public, e.g., \nat restaurants, libraries, shopping centers.  \n14. I have been receiving hormone treatment since \nDecember 2014. The hormone treatment has deepened \nmy voice, increased my growth of facial hair, and given \nme a more masculine appearance.  \n15. In August 2014, my mother and I informed offi-\ncials at Gloucester High School that I am transgender \nand  that  I  changed  my  legal  name.  The  high  school \nagreed to change my name in my official school records.  \n16. Before the beginning of my sophomore year, my \nmother and I met with Gloucester High School Principal \nT. Nathan Collins and guidance counselor Tiffany Durr \nto discuss my treatment for Gender Dysphoria and the \nneed for me to socially transition at school as part of my \nmedical treatment. Mr. Collins and Ms. Durr both ex-\npressed support for me and a willingness to ensure a \nwelcoming environment for me at school.  \n17. Ms. Durr and I agreed that I would send an email \nto teachers explaining that I was to be addressed using \nthe name G.G. and to be referred to using male pro-\nnouns. To the best of my knowledge, no teachers, admin-\nistrators, or staff at Gloucester High School expressed \nany resistance to calling me by my legal name or refer-\nring to me using male pronouns.  \n\n149a \n \n18. I requested, and was permitted, to continue with \nthe home-bound program only for my physical education \nrequirement while returning to school for the rest of my \nclasses. For this reason, I do not intend to use a locker \nroom at school.  \n19. I initially agreed to use a separate restroom in the \nnurse’s office because I was unsure how other students \nwould react to my transition. When the 2014–15 school \nyear began, I was pleased to discover that my teachers \nand the vast majority of my peers respected the fact that \nI am a boy. I quickly determined that it was not neces-\nsary for me to continue to use the nurse’s restroom, and \nI found it stigmatizing to use a separate restroom. The \nnurse’s bathroom was also very inconvenient to reach \nfrom my classrooms, making it difficult for me to use the \nrestroom between classes. For these reasons, I asked \nMr. Collins to be allowed to use the boys’ restrooms.  \n20. On or about October 20, 2014, Mr. Collins agreed \nthat I could use the boys’ restrooms. For approximately \nthe  next  seven  weeks,  I  used  the  boys’  restrooms  at \nschool. When I used the boys’ restrooms, I never en-\ncountered any problems from other students.  \n21. On November 10, 2014, I learned that the School \nBoard would be voting on a proposal at its meeting on \nNovember  11,  2014,  to  adopt  a  transgender  restroom \npolicy that would prohibit me from continuing to use the \nboys’ restroom. My parents and I attended the meeting \nto speak against the policy. In doing so, I was forced to \nidentify myself to the entire community, including local \npress covering the meeting, as the transgender student \nwhose restroom use was at issue.  \n\n150a \n \n22. I also attended the School Board’s meeting on \nDecember 9, 2014, when it adopted the transgender rest-\nroom policy.  \n23. As a result of the School Board meetings and the \nnew transgender restroom policy, I feel like I have been \nstripped of my privacy and dignity. Having the entire \ncommunity discuss my genitals and my medical condition \nin a public setting has made me feel like a walking freak \nshow. This personal information about my medical sta-\ntus, and about my very anatomy, has become a public \nspectacle. My entire community can now identify me as \n“the  transgender  student  who  wants  to  use  the  boys’ \nroom,” which makes me incredibly anxious and fearful.  \n24. The day after the school board meeting, Mr. Col-\nlins told me that I would no longer be allowed to use the \nboys’  restrooms  and  that  there  would  be  disciplinary \nconsequences if I tried to do so.  \n25. Using the girls’ restroom is not a possibility for \nme. Even before I began receiving treatment for Gender \nDysphoria, girls and women who encountered me in fe-\nmale  restrooms  reacted  negatively  because  they  per-\nceived me to be a boy. For example, when I used the \ngirls’ restroom in eighth and ninth grade, girls would tell \nme “this is the girls’ room” and ask me to leave. My ap-\npearance now is even more masculine. In addition, using \nthe girls’ room would cause me to experience severe psy-\nchological distress and would be incompatible with my \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria.  \n26. To the best of my knowledge, there are now three \nsingle-stall unisex restrooms at Gloucester High School \nthat I am permitted to use. Only one of the single-stall \nrestrooms is located anywhere near the restrooms used \nby other students. Unlike some of the boys’ restrooms, \n\n151a \n \nnone of the new single stall restrooms are located near \nmy classes. As far as I am aware, none of the other stu-\ndents uses the single-stall unisex restrooms.  \n27. I refuse to use the separate single-stall restrooms \nbecause they make me feel even more stigmatized and \nisolated than when I use the restroom in the nurse’s of-\nfice.  They  designate  me  as  some  type  of  “other”  or \n“third” sex that is treated differently than everyone else. \nEveryone knows that they were installed for me in par-\nticular so that other boys would not have to share the \nsame restroom as me.  \n28. Instead of using the separate restrooms, I try to \navoid using the restrooms entirely while at school, and, if \nthat is not possible, I use the nurse’s restroom. I limit \nthe amount of liquids I drink and try to “hold it” when I \nneed to urinate during the school day. As a result of try-\ning to avoid using the restroom, I have repeatedly devel-\noped painful urinary tract infections. “Holding it” is also \nuncomfortable and distracting when I am trying to focus \nin class.  \n29. Every time I use the restroom at school, I am re-\nminded that nearly every person in my community now \nknows I am transgender and that I have now been publi-\ncally identified as “different.” It also stark reminder that \nI was born in the wrong sex, which increases my feelings \nof dysphoria, anxiety, and distress.  \n30. It is embarrassing that, every time I use the rest-\nroom,  everyone  who  sees  me  enter  the  nurse’s  office \nknows exactly why I am in there. They know it is be-\ncause I am transgender and I have been prohibited from \nusing the same boys’ restrooms that the other boys use.  \n31. It also feels humiliating that, whenever I have to \nuse the restroom, I am effectively reminding anyone who \n\n152a \n \nsees me go to the nurse’s office that, even though I am \nliving and interacting with the world in accordance with \nmy gender identity as a boy, my genitals look different.  \n32. I just want to live my life like any other boy. And \nI want to perform the basic human function of using the \nrestroom without being made to feel alienated, humiliat-\ned, and different than everyone else.  \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty \nof perjury under the laws of the United States of Ameri-\nca that the foregoing is true and correct.(cid:2) \nExecuted on June 3, 2015.  \n \nBy:   [SIGNATURE FILED UNDER SEAL] \n    G.G. \n \n   \n\n153a \n \nAgenda Item Details           \n \nMeeting   Jun 09, 2016 - Regular Meeting No. 21  \n \nCategory   4.

This proposal has been with-\ndrawn.  \n \nA. In chapter I.I.2., changed “The principal’s decision on \na complaint may be appealed by the student or parent to \nthe regional assistant superintendent within two school \ndays following receipt of the principal’s decision” to read \n“The principal’s decision on a complaint may be submit-\nted for review by the student or parent to the regional \nassistant superintendent within two school days follow-\ning receipt of the principal’s decision.” (page 9)  \n \nB.

I move that the Board's action regarding R2601 be \npostponed until the June 30 Board meeting. [Wilson]  \n \n2. I move to amend the motion by replacing the first sen-\ntence of Chapter I, Section J with the following: No stu-\ndent in FCPS shall, on the basis of age, race, color, sex, \nsexual  orientation,  gender  identity,  religion,  national \norigin,  marital(cid:2)status,  or  disability,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject-\ned to discrimination under any education program or ac-\ntivity. [McElveen]  \n \n3. I move to delay consideration of Mr. McElveen’s mo-\ntion until the June 30 Board meeting to i) allow public \nnotice of a significant, substantive change to R2601, (ii) \ngive time for Board discussions with staff at a work ses-\nsion  on  issues  related  to  Mr.  McElveen’s  proposed \nchanges, and (iii) provide time for the Board to discuss \nproposed changes with each other and our communities. \n[Wilson]  \n \n4.  I  believe  the  numerous  questions  raised  by  Mr. \nMcElveen’s amendment raise unique and complex ques-\n\n156a \n \ntions that require considerably more study and investi-\ngation than is possible tonight. Thus, I move to refer the \nproposed new language to a special committee to study \nand investigate with staff these questions. I propose that \nthe committee be made up of several Board members, \nincluding, but not limited to, Mr. McElveen, Mrs. Hough, \nMrs. Corbett-Sanders and me.

Declaration  of  G.G.  (“G.G. \nDecl.”)  ¶¶ 4–5.  Defendant  Gloucester  County  School \nBoard is an elected body responsible for the operation of \nthe District. See Plaintiffs Complaint (“Compl.”) at ¶ 11. \nG.G. is a transgender boy.1 See G.G. Decl. at ¶ 10. He was \nassigned the female sex at birth, but his gender identity \nis male and he presents as a boy in all aspects of his life. \nSee id. at ¶¶ 6, 11. GG alleges that the District denied \nhim equal treatment and benefits and subjected him to \ndiscrimination based on sex in violation of Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, when \nit passed a policy banning his continued use of the boys’ \nrestrooms because the School Board did deem him to be \n“ ‘biologically’ male,” despite his use of those facilities \nwithout incident for seven weeks. Compl. ¶¶ 6, 65; see \nalso G.G. Decl. at ¶¶ 20, 22–23. G.G. has moved for a pre-\nliminary injunction requiring the District to allow him to \nresume using the boys’ restrooms at Gloucester High \nSchool when he returns for the first day of classes on \nSeptember 8, 2015. Plaintiff’s Memorandum In Support \nof  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  at  1  (“Plaintiff \nMemo”). \nThe United States files this Statement of Interest to \nassist the Court in evaluating G.G.’s request for a prelim-\ninary  injunction,  specifically,  in  determining  whether \nG.G. has established a likelihood of success on the merits \nand whether an injunction is in the public interest.2 Un-\n                                                   \n1 A transgender person has a gender identity (i.e., one’s internal \nsense of gender) that is different from the individual’s assigned sex \nat birth (i.e., the gender designation listed on one’s original birth \ncertificate). \n2 The United States does not address the factors of irreparable harm \nContinued … \n\n162a \n \nder Title IX, discrimination based on a person’s gender \nidentity,  a  person’s  transgender  status,  or  a  person’s \nnonconformity to sex stereotypes constitutes discrimina-\ntion based on sex. As such, prohibiting a student from \naccessing the restrooms that match his gender identity is \nprohibited sex discrimination under Title IX. There is a \npublic interest in ensuring that all students, including \ntransgender students, have the opportunity to learn in \nan environment free of sex discrimination.  \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States has authority to file this State-\nment of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C(cid:2)§ 517, which per-\nmits the Attorney General to attend to the interests of \nthe United States in any case pending in a federal court. \nThe United States has a significant interest in ensuring \nthat all students, including transgender students, have \nthe opportunity to learn in an environment free of sex \ndiscrimination and that the proper legal standards are \napplied to claims under Title IX.3 The United States De-\n                                                                                                        \nor the balance of hardships that are also used to establish the need \nfor a preliminary injunction. See infra p. 4. \n3 The United States has furthered its significant interests noted \nabove  by  intervening  or  submitting  briefs  in  lawsuits  involving \nclaims of sex discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender-\nbased harassment against students under Title IX. See, e.g., United \nStates’ Amicus Curiae Brief Supporting Plaintiffs-Appellants and \nUrging Reversal in Carmichael v. Galbraith, No. 12-11074 (5th Cir. \nApr. 1, 2013) (explaining that the prohibitions against sex discrimi-\nnation under Title IX prohibit sex-based harassment predicated on \nsex stereotyping), available at http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/app/ \nbriefs/carmichaelbrf.pdf; United States’ Complaint-in- Intervention, \nDoe v. Anoka-Hennepin Sch. Dist. No. 11, No. 0:11-cv-01999 (D. \nContinued … \n\n163a \n \npartments of Justice and Education enforce Title IX and \nits implementing regulations in the education context. \nSee 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688 (2006); 34 C.F.R. Part 106 \n(2010); 28 C.F.R. Part 54 (2000).4 \nThe  United  States  thus  respectfully  submits  this \nStatement of Interest to provide the correct legal stand-\nards governing sex discrimination claims under Title IX. \nApplying these standards, there is a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of G.G.’s allegation of discrimina-\ntion based on sex because the District has adopted and is \nenforcing a policy that discriminates based on sex (e.g., \none’s gender identity, including one’s transgender sta-\ntus) and there is a strong public interest in eliminating \ndiscrimination based on sex in public schools.  \n                                                                                                        \nMinn. Mar. 6, 2012) (explaining that the prohibitions against sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause pro-\nhibit  sex-based  harassment  because  of  gender  non-conformity), \navailable  at  http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/edu/documents/ \nanokacompint.pdf; and United States’ Mem. as Amicus Curiae in \nResponse to Defs.

BACKGROUND \nThe United States recites the following facts drawn \nfrom  Plaintiff’s  Complaint  and  Declaration.  Elrod  v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 (1976) (“[U]ncontroverted \naffidavits filed in support of the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction are taken as true.”). Gloucester County Public \nSchools and Gloucester High School are education pro-\ngrams  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance.  Compl. \n¶ 63. G.G. is a transgender student who completed his \nsophomore  year  at  Gloucester  High  School.  See  G.G. \nDecl. at ¶¶ 5, 10. G.G. alleges that the District denied him \nthe treatment and benefits afforded to other male stu-\ndents and that he was subjected to discrimination in vio-\nlation of Title IX. See Plaintiff Memo; G.G. Decl. at ¶¶ 23, \n32.  Specifically,  G.G.  alleges  that,  although  the  school \nhad allowed him to use the boys’ restroom for approxi-\nmately seven weeks without incident, the school board \npassed a policy limiting the use of restroom facilities to \nstudents  with  “corresponding  biological  genders”  and \nrequired students with “gender identity issues” to use an \nalternative  private  facility.  Plaintiff  Memo  at  17.  By \npassing  this  policy,  the  school  board  prohibited  G.G. \nfrom  continuing  his  use  of  the  boys’  restrooms.  G.G. \nDecl. at ¶ 24. G.G. seeks a preliminary injunction to rein-\nstate his access to the boys’ restrooms, the status quo \nprior to the District’s approval of the policy in question. \nG.G. Decl. at ¶ 20. G.G. asks this Court to order that in-\njunction before the first day of classes on September 8, \n2015. Plaintiff Memo at 15.  \n\n165a \n \nII. ARGUMENT \nA. Preliminary Injunction Standard \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, “Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate that (1) they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) they will likely suffer irreparable harm absent \nan injunction; (3) the balance of hardships weighs in their \nfavor; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.” \nLeague of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 \nF.3d 224, 236 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing Winter v. Natural \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)); see also \nDoe v. Wood Cnty.(cid:2)Bd. of Educ., 888 F. Supp. 2d 771, \n773 (S.D. W. Va. 2012) (granting preliminary injunction \nin case alleging Title IX violations, relying on U.S. De-\npartment of Education regulations). To demonstrate that \na plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits, a plaintiff \nmust make a “clear showing” that he is likely to succeed \nat  trial,  but  “need  not  show  a  certainty  of  success.” \nPashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th Cir. 2013). The \nSupreme Court has also instructed courts to “pay partic-\nular regard” to public interest considerations. Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24.  \nB.  G.G. Has Established a Likelihood of Success \non  the  Merits  Because  Title  IX  Prohibits \nDiscrimination  Based  on  Sex,  Including \nGender  Identity,  Transgender  Status,  and \nNonconformity to Sex Stereotypes.  \nIn considering G.G.’s request for a preliminary in-\njunction, this Court must consider G.G.’s likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits—that is, whether either Title IX \nprohibits a school district from passing, and then enforc-\ning, a policy that prohibits a student from using the re-\nstroom that matches his gender identity. See League of \n\n166a \n \nWomen, 769 F.3d at 236. For the reasons set forth below, \nTitle IX prohibits such a policy as unlawful sex discrimi-\nnation. Therefore, G.G. is likely to succeed on the merits.  \n1.   Discrimination Based on Gender Identity, \nIncluding Transgender Status, is Discrim-\nination Based on Sex.  \nG.G. is likely to succeed on the merits under Title IX. \nUnder Title IX, “[n]o person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Fed-\neral financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31(a); 28 C.F.R. § 54.400(a).5 The plain lan-\nguage of the statute thus affirms that Title IX protects \nall  persons,  including  transgender  students,  from  sex \ndiscrimination. Title IX’s implementing regulations spe-\ncifically prohibit recipients from engaging in differential \nor adverse treatment on the basis of sex, including, inter \nalia,  \n•  “[t]reat[ing] any one person differently from an-\nother in determining whether such person satis-\nfies any requirement or condition for the provi-\nsion of such aid, benefit, or service;”  \n \n                                                   \n5 The District’s restroom policy is part of its “educational program \nor activity.” See 20 U.S.C. § 1687(2)(b) (defining “program or activi-\nty” to mean “all the operations” of a “local education agency . . . any \npart of which is extended Federal financial assistance”). \n \n\n167a \n \n•  “[p]rovid[ing] different aid, benefits, or services \nor provid[ing] aid, benefits, or services in a differ-\nent manner;” \n \n•  “[d]eny[ing] any person any such aid, benefit, or \nservice;” \n•  “[s]ubject[ing] any person to separate or different \nrules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment” \n•  “[o]therwise limit[ing] any person in the enjoy-\nment of any right, privilege, advantage, or oppor-\ntunity.  \n34 C.F.R § 106.31(b); 28 C.F.R. § 54.400(b). Therefore, \nany student, including a transgender student, may state \na valid claim under Title IX by alleging that the defend-\nant denied or limited the student’s ability to participate \nin or benefit from the school’s programs or activities on \nthe basis of sex.6 \nThe term “sex” as it is used in Title IX is broad and \nencompasses gender identity, including transgender sta-\ntus. “There is no doubt that ‘if we are to give Title IX the \nscope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep \nas broad as its language.’ ” North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. \nBell,  456  U.S.  512,  521  (1982)  (brackets  omitted).  In \nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court flatly \nrejected the notion that “sex” encompasses only one’s \nbiological status as male or female, concluding, instead, \n                                                   \n6 See OCR, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence \n(Apr. 29,2014), available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/ \ndocs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf  (“OCR  Sexual  Violence  Q&A”),  at  5 \n(“[T]he actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of \nthe parties does not change a school’s [Title IX] obligations.”). \n\n168a \n \nthat  sex  discrimination  also  encompasses  differential \ntreatment based on one’s failure to conform to socially- \nconstructed  gender  expectations.7  490  U.S.  228,  250 \n(1989)  (plurality  opinion).  Thus,  “under  Price  Water-\nhouse, ‘sex’ under Title VII encompasses both sex—that \nis, the biological differences between men and women—\nand gender.” Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1202 \n(9th Cir. 2000) (court’s italics); see also Macy v. Holder, \n2012 WL 1435995, at *6 (EEOC Apr. 20, 2012).8 This is \n                                                   \n7 All the cases cited in this paragraph except for North Haven inter-\npret Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”). Federal courts \nroutinely rely on Title VII’s analogous prohibition of sex discrimina-\ntion in employment when construing the meaning of Title IX’s anti-\ndiscrimination provisions. See, e.g., Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. \nSch., 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992) (applying Supreme Court’s interpreta-\ntion of sex discrimination under Title VII to Title IX); Jennings v. \nUniv. of N.C., 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) (“We look to case law \ninterpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for guidance in \nevaluating a claim brought under Title IX.”); Preston v. Virginia ex \nrel New River Comm. Coll., 31 F.3d 203, 207–08 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(holding that Title IX discrimination claim should be interpreted in \naccordance with principles governing Title VII).  \n8 In Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, No. 13-213, 2015 WL 1497753 \n(W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2015), appeal docketed No. 15-2022 (3d Cir. Apr. \n22, 2015), the district court adopted a “narrow view of the meaning \nof the statutory term ‘sex’ ” in concluding that Title IX does not pro-\nhibit discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status. \nId. at*14. Under that narrow view, the court interpreted the term to \nmean “nothing more than male or female, under the traditional bi-\nnary conception of sex consistent with one’s birth or biological sex.” \nId. at *13. The district court’s reasoning in that case was faulty and \nshould not be followed. As several courts have recognized, the dec-\nades-old Title VII case law the court cited for this sex-gender dis-\ntinction has been “eviscerated” by the Supreme Court’s decision in \nPrice Waterhouse. See Smith, 378 F.3d at 573; see also Schwenk, \n204 F.3d at 1202 (noting that the judge-made distinction between \nContinued … \n\n169a \n \nbecause an individual’s gender identity is one aspect of \nan individual’s sex. See, e.g., Smith v. City of Salem, 378 \nF.3d 566,575 (6th Cir. 2004); Schroer v. Billington, 424 \nF. Supp. 2d 203,211 (D.D.C 2006) (“scientific observation \nmay well confirm . . . that sex is not a cut-and-dried mat-\nter of chromosomes”) (internal citations omitted). Con-\nsequently, discrimination on the basis of gender identity \nis “literally” discrimination on the basis of sex. Schroer v. \nBillington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 306–07 (D.D.C. 2008).9  \nFurthermore, Title IX prohibits sex discrimination \nbased on the perception that an individual has under-\ngone, or is undergoing a gender transition. In Schroer, \nthe court offered the following analogy to help explain \nhow discrimination against an individual because he or \nshe has undertaken, or is undertaking, a gender transi-\ntion10 is sex discrimination:  \n                                                                                                        \nsex and gender “has been overruled by the logic and language of \nPrice Waterhouse”). Ultimately, the district court in Johnston at-\ntempted to discern the state of mind of the legislators when Con-\ngress prohibited sex discrimination in 1972, but that was not the \nproper inquiry. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc., 523 \nU.S. 75, 79 (1998) (explaining that “[s]tatutory prohibitions often go \nbeyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and \nit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal \nconcerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”); accord Ma-\ncy, 2012 WL 1435995, at *9–10 and n.10.  \n9 This is so even though the words gender identity or transgender \nare not explicitly used in Title IX. The statute’s literal language \n“demonstrates breadth” and may not be judicially narrowed even if \nit results in the statute being “applied in situations not expressly \nanticipated by Congress.” PA Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, \n212 (1998) (quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 499 \n(1985)). \n10 A gender transition is the process in which transgender individu-\nContinued … \n\n170a \n \nImagine that an employee is fired because she \nconverts from Christianity to Judaism. Imag-\nine too that her employer testifies that he har-\nbors no bias toward either Christians or Jews \nbut only “converts.” That would be a clear case \nof  discrimination  “because  of  religion.”  No \ncourt  would  take  seriously  the  notion  that \n“converts” are not covered by the statute. Dis-\ncrimination “because of religion” easily encom-\npasses discrimination because of a change of \nreligion.  \n577 F. Supp. 2d at 306 (emphasis in original). Denying \nTitle  IX’s  protections  to  a  student  because  he  has \nchanged or is changing his sex would be “blind . . . to the \nstatutory language itself.” Id. at 307; see also Lusardi v. \nMcHugh, Appeal No. 0120133395, 2015 WL 1607756, at \n*7–8 (EEOC Apr. 1, 2015) (concluding that federal agen-\ncy  violated  Title  VII  where  the  complainant’s  “trans-\ngender status was the motivation” for the agency to bar \nher from using the common women’s restrooms); Macy, \n2012 WL 1435995, at *11 (concluding that “intentional \ndiscrimination against a transgender individual because \nthat person is transgender is, by definition, discrimina-\ntion ‘based on . . . sex,’ and such discrimination therefore \nviolates Title VII”).  \nThis conclusion is reinforced, for purposes of Title \nIX,  by  the  enforcing  agencies’  interpretation  of  that \n                                                                                                        \nals assert the sex that corresponds to their gender identity instead \nof their sex assigned at birth.

The \nUnited States Department of Education (“ED”) through \nits Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) has issued guidance \nrecognizing that Title IX protects transgender students \nagainst  discrimination  based  on  their  gender  identity. \nSee OCR, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence  (April  29,  2014),  available  at  http://www2.ed. \ngov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf, at 5 \n(clarifying that Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition \nextends  to  claims  of  discrimination  based  on  gender \nidentity).  \nED has also explained, in other guidance, how its in-\nterpretation of Title IX applies when a school is permit-\nted by Title IX to offer sex-segregated programs. Specif-\nically, in the context of single-sex classes, “[u]nder Title \nIX, a [school district] generally must treat transgender \nstudents consistent with their gender identity in all as-\npects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, oper-\nation, and evaluation.” OCR, Questions and Answers on \nTitle  IX  and  Single-Sex  Elementary  and  Secondary \nClasses  and  Extracurricular  Activities  (Dec.  1,  2014), \navailable  at  http://www.ed.gov/ocr/docs/faqs-title-ix-\n\n172a \n \nsingle-sex-201412.pdfCOCRSingle-Sex  Classes  and  Ac-\ntivities Q&A”), at 25.

Unit 26, 86 A.3d 600, 605 (Me. 2014) (holding that school \ndistrict could not defend its decision to exclude a transgender girl \nfrom the girls’ restrooms based on a state statute requiring sex-\nseparated bathrooms in public schools because that statute “does \nnot purport to establish guidelines for the use of school bathrooms” \nnor “address how schools should monitor which students use which \nbathroom, and it certainly offers no guidance concerning how gen-\nder identity relates to the use of sex-separated facilities”). \n\n173a \n \nThus, the expansive construction of “sex” as spelled \nout in Price Waterhouse and its progeny; and the con-\nsistent interpretation of that term by the relevant en-\nforcing federal agencies, which is entitled to substantial \ndeference, both confirm that Title IX and its regulations \nprotect G.G. from discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity, including transgender status.  \n2.   Discrimination  Based  on  a  Transgender \nIndividual’s Nonconformity to Sex Stereo-\ntypes is Discrimination Based on Sex. \nG.G. is also likely to succeed on the merits of his Title \nIX claim under an alternative sex stereotyping theory. \nThe  Supreme  Court  made  clear  in  Price  Waterhouse \nthat discrimination based on an employee’s nonconformi-\nty to sex stereotypes is a form of sex discrimination. 490 \nU.S. at 239–40, 250–51; see also Pratt v.

See Doe v. \nBrimfield Grade Sch., 552 F. Supp. 2d 816, 823 (C.D. Ill. 2008); The-\nno v. Tonganoxie Unified Sch. Dist., 377 F. Supp. 2d 952, 964–65 (D. \nKan. 2005); Montgomery v. Indep Sch. Dist.

No. Civ.02-\n1531PHX-SRB,  2004  WL  2008954  (D.  Ariz.  June  3, \n2004).

City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 575 (6th Cir. \n2004) (\"discrimination against a plaintiff who is a transsexual—and \ntherefore fails to act and/or identify with his or her gender—is no \ndifferent from the discrimination directed against Ann Hopkins in \nPrice Waterhouse”); Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1320–21 (finding “ample \ndirect evidence” that plaintiff, a transgender woman, had been dis-\ncriminated against because of sex where defendant testified that his \ndecision to fire her was based “on his perception of [plaintiff] as ‘a \nman dressed as a woman and made up as a woman’ ”); Finkle v. \nHoward Cnty., 12 F. Supp. 3d 780, 788 (D. Md. 2014) (holding that \nplaintiff’s claim that she was discriminated against “because of her \nobvious transgendered status” is a cognizable claim of sex discrimi-\nnation under Title VII). \n\n175a \n \n“behavior, appearance, or anatomical features.”15 Id. at \n*3. The Kastl court made clear that neither a “woman \nwith male genitalia nor a man with stereotypically female \nanatomy” may be discriminated against “by reason of \nthat nonconforming trait.” Id. at *2.16 ED has also issued \n                                                   \n15 Some courts have limited the ability of transgender people to rely \non the sex stereotyping theory when their claims of discrimination \ninvolve access to gender identity-appropriate restrooms. See, e.g., \nMichaels v. Akal Sec, Inc., No. 09-cv-01300-ZLW-CBS, 2010 WL \n2573988 (D. Colo. June 24, 2010) (“Etsitty [v. Utah Transit Auth., \n502 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir. 2007)] precludes such a claim [i.e., gender \nstereotyping  under  Price  Waterhouse]  based  solely  upon  re-\nstrictions  on  Plaintiff’s  usage  of  certain  bathrooms.”)  (emphasis \nadded). But the Johnston court’s recent assertion that sex stereo-\ntyping claims can only be “based on behaviors, mannerisms, and \nappearances” and cannot be based on gender-nonconforming anat-\nomy has no support in law or logic. Johnston, 2015 WL 1497753, at \n*16; see also Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir. \n2007). Both cases are grounded in a flawed premise: namely, that \nthe “sex” of the transgender plaintiff, for Title VII purposes, is the \nsex he was assigned at birth, not the gender with which he identifies. \nIt is true that sex stereotyping claims brought by transgender plain-\ntiffs often involve claims that the defendant discriminated against \nthe plaintiff because the plaintiff’s gender presentation did not con-\nform to the defendant’s belief about how a person of the plaintiff’s \nassigned birth sex should look, speak, or behave. However, nothing \nin Price Waterhouse or its progeny purported to limit the availabil-\nity of the theory to only those forms of sex stereotyping. Indeed, \nsex-based stereotyping regarding anatomy (e.g., that women have \nbreasts or that men have two testicles), is also prohibited discrimi-\nnation based on sex.  \n16 On a subsequent summary judgment motion, the district court \nruled that the Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of establishing a \nprima facie case of discrimination because she “failed to properly \npresent evidence supporting her theory that there are other deter-\nminants of biological sex or which, if any, of those determinants ap-\nContinued … \n\n176a \n \nguidance stating that Title IX prohibits discrimination \nbased on sex stereotypes, including when that discrimi-\nnation is directed at transgender individuals.

Maricopa Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 2006 \nWL 2460636, at *6 (D. Ariz. Aug. 22, 2006). In an unpublished deci-\nsion, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s grant of sum-\nmary judgment to the college on the ground that the transgender \nfemale plaintiff failed to show that the college’s asserted reason for \nbarring  her  from  the  women’s  restroom—namely,  safety—was \npretextual. Kastl v. Maricopa Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 325 Fed. \nAppx. 492, 494 (9th Cir. 2009). Apart from the fact that there is no \nindication of a safety concern here—Gloucester school officials had \nreadily  allowed  G.G.  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms  for  nearly  two \nmonths without incident—the Ninth Circuit’s reliance on plaintiff’s \nfailure to meet the standards under the burden-shifting framework \nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) was mis-\nplaced.  “[A]n  employee  need  not  use  the  McDonnell  Douglas \nframework when there is direct evidence that an adverse employ-\nment action has been taken on the basis of a sex-based consideration \nsuch as an employee’s transgender status.” Lusardi, EEOC Deci-\nsion No. 0120133395 at n.6. For purposes of G.G.’s allegations, the \ncritical  point  is  that  even  the  Ninth  Circuit  upheld  the  district \ncourt’s conclusion that the Kastl plaintiff alleged a valid prima facie \nsex stereotyping claim based on her nonconformity with the col-\nlege’s stereotypes about what anatomy one must have to be female. \nSee Kastl, 325 Fed. Appx. at 493.  \n17 See also OCR Single-Sex Classes and Activities Q&A, at 25; OCR, \nRevised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by \nSchool Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties (2001), availa-\nble at http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide. pdf, at \nv. \n\n177a \n \nHere, the District adopted a policy to prevent G.G., \nwho presents and identifies as male, from using male re-\nstroom facilities, despite the fact that he had been using \nthose facilities without incident for seven weeks. That \npolicy, and its application to G.G., is based on impermis-\nsible sex stereotypes about what it means to be a boy. \nFor that reason, G.G. is likely to succeed on the merits of \nhis Title IX claim under a sex stereotyping theory as \nwell. \nC.  Granting a Preliminary Injunction is in the \nPublic Interest. \nFinally,  granting  the  injunctive  relief  G.G.  seeks \nwould serve the public interest. Requiring public schools \nto comply with their Title IX obligation not to discrimi-\nnate on the basis of sex serves the public interest. See \nCohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F. 2d 888, 906 (1st Cir. 1993) \n(affirming district court’s conclusion “that the overriding \npublic interest lay in the firm enforcement of Title IX”). \nIn the education context in particular, the public in-\nterest favors eliminating policies that single out a minor-\nity of public school students for different treatment on \nthe basis of sex. When a State makes free public educa-\ntion available to the children in its jurisdiction (and, in \nfact, adopts compulsory attendance laws that presump-\ntively require attendance), educational opportunity must \n“be made available to all on equal terms.” Brown v. Bd. \nof Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954). In the Gloucester Pub-\nlic  School  District,  however,  G.G.  and  any  other \ntransgender students like him are being singled out and \ndenied access to restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity solely on that basis—a basic right that all other \nstudents enjoy. That singling out results in isolation and \n\n178a \n \nexclusion and perpetuates a sense that the student is not \n“worthy  of  equal  treatment  and  respect.”  Lusardi, \nEEOC Decision No. 0120133395 at 13; see also Brown, \n374 U.S. at 494 (“A sense of inferiority affects the moti-\nvation of a child to learn.” (quoting state court)). Grant-\ning transgender students access to restrooms consistent \nwith their gender identity will serve the public interest \nby ensuring that the District treats all students within \nits bounds with respect and dignity. \nSingling  out  transgender  students  and  subjecting \nthem to differential treatment can also make them more \nvulnerable to bullying and harassment, a problem that \ntransgender students already face. For example, during \nthe  2008–2009  school  year,  “more  than  90  percent  of \n[lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender]  students  in \ngrades 6 through 12 reported being verbally harassed—\nand  almost  half  reported  being  physically  harassed.” \nDear  Colleague  Letter  from  Sec’y  Duncan  (June  14, \n2011), available at http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/ \nsecletter/110607.html. Allowing transgender students to \nuse the restrooms consistent with their gender identity \nwill help prevent stigma that results in bullying and har-\nassment and will ensure that the District fosters a safe \nand supportive learning environment for all students, a \nresult that is unquestionably in the public interest.18 \n                                                   \n18 It is well-established that academic excellence and student success \ndepend on the school environment being both safe and supportive. \nSee “Guiding Principles: A Resource Guide for Improving School \nClimate and Discipline,” ED (Jan. 2014), at 5; see also “School Cli-\nmate,”  ED,  American  Institute  for  Research,  Safe  Supportive \nLearning,  available  at  http://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/school-\nclimate. By contrast, students who are bullied suffer from negative \nphysical, social, and mental health issues. The White House and var-\nContinued … \n\n179a \n \nNumerous  jurisdictions  around  the  country  allow \ntransgender students to use facilities corresponding to \ntheir gender identity.19 Likewise, the federal government \nhas recognized the importance of establishing policies in \nthe workplace that allow transgender employees to use \nfacilities corresponding to their gender identity, see U.S. \nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (“OPM”),  “Gender \nIdentity Guidance” (stating that federal agencies “should \nallow access to restrooms and (if provided to other em-\nployees)  locker  room  facilities  consistent  with  [a \ntransgender  employee’s]  gender  identity”);  see  U.S. \nDept. of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Admin-\n                                                                                                        \nious Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and \nEducation, have worked, and continue to work, to prevent bullying \nand educate the public about the negative effects of bullying. See, \ne.g., www.stopbullying.gov (providing information from various gov-\nernment agencies on what bullying is, what cyberbullying is, who is \nat risk, and how one can prevent and respond to bullying); “Back-\nground on White House Conference on Bullying Prevention,” White \nHouse  Press  Release  (Mar.  10,  2011),  available  at  https://www. \nwhitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/10/background-white-\nhouse-conference-bullying-prevention.  \n19 Cal.

As the EEOC stated in Lusardi, “[a]llowing the \n                                                   \n20 The federal government has also established similar policies for \nparticipants in other federally funded education programs.

See, e.g., Cruzan v. Special Sch. Dist.

Civil Action  \nNo. 7:16-cv-00054–O \n  \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al. \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER \nBefore the Court are Plaintiffs’ Application for Pre-\nliminary Injunction (ECF No. 11), filed July 6, 2016; De-\nfendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs Application for Prelim-\ninary Injunction (ECF No. 40), filed July 27, 2016; and \nPlaintiffs’ Reply (ECF No. 52), filed August 3, 2016. The \nCourt held a preliminary injunction hearing on August \n12, 2016, and counsel for the parties presented their ar-\nguments. See ECF No. 56.1 \n                                                   \n1 The Court also considers various amicus briefs filed by interested \nparties. See ECF Nos. 16, 28, 34, 36- 1, 38-1. \n \n\n184a \n \nThis case presents the difficult issue of balancing the \nprotection of students’ rights and that of personal priva-\ncy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, \nand other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no stu-\ndent  is  unnecessarily  marginalized  while  attending \nschool. The sensitivity to this matter is heightened be-\ncause Defendants’ actions apply to the youngest child \nattending school and continues for every year through-\nout each child’s educational career. The resolution of this \ndifficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this \nOrder.  Instead,  the  Constitution  assigns  these  policy \nchoices  to  the  appropriate  elected  and  appointed  offi-\ncials, who must follow the proper legal procedure.  \nThat being the case, the issues Plaintiffs present re-\nquire this Court to first decide whether there is authori-\nty to hear this matter. If so, then the Court must deter-\nmine whether Defendants failed to follow the proper le-\ngal procedures before issuing the Guidelines in dispute \nand, if they failed to do so, whether the Guidelines must \nbe suspended until Congress acts or Defendants follow \nthe proper legal procedure. For the following reasons, \nthe Court concludes that jurisdiction is proper here and \nthat Defendants failed to comply with the Administrative \nProcedures  Act  by:  (1)  foregoing  the  Administrative \nProcedures Act’s notice and comment requirements; and \n(2) issuing directives which contradict the existing legis-\nlative and regulatory texts. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Mo-\ntion should be and is hereby GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe following factual recitation is taken from Plain-\ntiffs’ Application for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. \n11) unless stated otherwise. Plaintiffs are composed of 13 \n\n185a \n \nstates and agencies represented by various state leaders, \nas well as Harrold Independent School District of Texas \nand Heber-Overgaard Unified School District of Arizo-\nna.2 They have sued the U.S. Departments of Education \n(“DOE”),  Justice  (“DOJ”),  Labor  (“DOL”),  the  Equal \nEmployment  Opportunity  Commission  (“EEOC”),  and \nvarious agency officials (collectively “Defendants”), chal-\nlenging Defendants’ assertions that Title VII and Title \nIX require that all persons must be afforded the oppor-\ntunity to have access to restrooms, locker rooms, show-\ners, and other intimate facilities which match their gen-\nder identity rather than their biological sex.3 Plaintiffs \n                                                   \n2 Plaintiffs include: (1) the State of Texas; (2) Harrold Independent \nSchool District (TX); (3) the State of Alabama; (4) the State of Wis-\nconsin; (5) the State of West Virginia; (6) the State of Tennessee; (7) \nArizona Department of Education; (8) Heber-Overgaard Unified \nSchool District (Arizona); (9) Paul LePage, Governor of the State of \nMaine; (10) the State of Oklahoma; (11) the State of Louisiana; (12) \nthe State of Utah; (13) the state of Georgia; (14) the State of Missis-\nsippi, by and through Governor Phil Bryant; (15) the Common-\nwealth of Kentucky, by and through Governor Matthew G. Bevin.  \n3 Plaintiffs refer to a person’s “biological sex” when discussing the \ndifferences between males and females, while Defendants refer to a \nperson’s sex based on the sex assigned to them at birth and reflect-\ned on their birth certificate or based on “gender identity” which is \n“an individual’s internal sense of gender.” See Am. Compl. 12, ECF \nNo. 6; Mot. Injunction 1, ECF No. 11; Am. Compl. Ex. C (Holder \nTransgender Title VII Memo) (“Holder Memo 2014”) App. 1 n.1, \nECF No. 6-3 (“ ‘[G]ender identity’ [is defined] as an individual’s in-\nternal senses of being male or female.”); Id. at Ex. J. (DOJ/DOE \nLetter) 2, ECF No. 6-10. When referring to a transgendered person, \nDefendants’ Guidelines state “transgender individuals are people \nwith a gender identity that is different from the sex assigned to \nthem at birth . . . .” Am. Compl., Ex. C (Holder Memo 2014), App. 1 \nn.1, ECF No. 6-3. “For example, a transgender man may have been \nContinued … \n\n186a \n \nclaim that on May 13, 2016, Defendants wrote to schools \nacross  the  country  in  a  Dear  Colleague  Letter  on \nTransgender Students (the “DOJ/DOE Letter”) and told \nthem that they must “immediately allow students to use \nthe  bathrooms,  locker  rooms  and  showers  of  the  stu-\ndent’s choosing, or risk losing Title IX-linked funding.” \nMot. Injunction 1, ECF No. 11. Plaintiffs also allege De-\nfendants have asserted that employers who “refuse to \npermit employees to utilize the intimate areas of their \nchoice face legal liability under Title VII.” Id. Plaintiffs \ncomplain that Defendants’ interpretation of the defini-\ntion of “sex” in the various written directives (collectively \n“the Guidelines”)4 as applied to Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) is unlawful and has \nplaced them in legal jeopardy.  \nPlaintiffs contend that when Title IX was signed into \nlaw, neither Congress nor agency regulators and third \nparties “believed that the law opened all bathrooms and \nother intimate facilities to members of both sexes.” Mot. \nInjunction. 1, ECF No. 11. Instead, they argue one of \n                                                                                                        \nassigned female at birth and raised as a girl, but identify as a man.” \nId. at Ex. D (OSHA Best Practices Guide to Restroom Access for \nTransgender Employees) (“OSHA Best Practice Guide”), App. 1, \nECF No. 6-4. The Court attempts to use the parties’ descriptions \nthroughout this Order for the sake of clarity. \n4  The  Guidelines  refer  to  the  documents  attached  to  Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint: (1) Ex. A (DOE Bullying Memo 2010), ECF \nNo. 6-1; (2) Ex. B (DOE Questions and Answers on Title IX and \nSexual Violence Memo) (“DOE Q&A Memo), ECF No. 6-2; (3) Ex. C \n(“Holder Memo 2014”), ECF No. 6-3, (4) Ex. D (OSHA Best Prac-\ntice Guide), ECF No. 6-4; (5) Ex. H (EEOC Fact Sheet), ECF No. 6-\n8; and (6) Ex. J (DOJ/DOE Dear Colleague Letter), ECF No. 6-10. \n\n187a \n \nTitle  IX’s  initial  implementing  regulations,  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 (“§ 106.33” or “Section 106.33”), expressly au-\nthorized separate restrooms on the basis of sex. Section \n106.33 provides: “A recipient may provide separate toi-\nlet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut such facilities provided for students of one sex shall \nbe comparable to such facilities provided for students of \nthe other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. Plaintiffs assert the \nterm sex in the pertinent statutes and regulations means \nthe  biological  differences  between  a  male  and  female. \nMot. Injunction 2, ECF No. 11. Plaintiffs state that De-\nfendants’ swift move to supplant the traditional, biologi-\ncal meaning of sex with a definition based on gender \nidentity through the Guidelines, coupled with Defend-\nants’  actions  to  enforce  these  new  agency  policies \nthrough investigations and compliance reviews, causes \nPlaintiffs to suffer irreparable harm for which a prelimi-\nnary injunction is needed. Id. at 3–8; Pls.’ Reply 3–7, \nECF No. 54.  \nDefendants contend that the Guidelines and recent \nenforcement  actions  are  designed  to  prohibit  sex  dis-\ncrimination  on  the  basis  of  gender  identity  and  are \n“[c]onsistent with the nondiscrimination mandate of [Ti-\ntle  IX],”  and  that  “these  guidance  documents  . . .  are \nmerely expressions of the agencies’ views as to what the \nlaw requires.” Defs.’ Resp. 2–4, ECF No. 40. Defendants \nalso contend that the Guidelines “are not legally binding, \nand they expose [P]laintiffs to no new liability or legal \nrequirements” because DOE “has issued documents of \nthis nature for decades, across multiple administrations, \nin order to notify schools and other recipients of federal \nfunds about how the agency interprets the law and how \n\n188a \n \nit views new and emerging issues.” Id. at 4–5.5 Defend-\nants also state that the “[g]uidance documents issued by \n[DOE] ‘do not create or confer any rights for or on any \nperson  and  do  not  impose  any  requirements  beyond \nthose required under applicable law and regulations’ ” \nand these documents expressly state that they do not \ncarry the force of law. Id. at 5 (citing Holder Memo 2, \nECF No. 6-10, to clarify that “the best reading of Title \nVII’s prohibition of sex discrimination is that it encom-\npasses discrimination based on gender identity, including \ntransgender status,” but the memo “is not intended to \notherwise prescribe the course of litigation or defenses \nthat should be raised in any particular employment dis-\ncrimination case”).  \nA. Title IX \nTitle IX, enacted in 1972, is the landmark legislation \nwhich prohibits discrimination among federal fund recip-\nients by providing that no person “shall, on the basis of \nsex, . . . be subjected to discrimination under any educa-\ntional program or activity receiving Federal financial as-\nsistance.” 20 USC § 1681. The legislative history shows \nCongress hailed Title IX as an indelible step forward for \nwomen’s rights. Mot. Injunction at 2–4. After its pas-\nsage, the DOE and its predecessor implemented a num-\nber of regulations which sought to enforce Title IX, chief \namong them, and at issue here, § 106.33. See G.G. ex rel \n                                                   \n5 Defendants cited to U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, \nSex  Discrimination  Policy  Guidance,  http://www2.ed.gov/about/ \noffices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/sex.html (last visited \nAugust 5, 2016) (discussing the purpose of guidance documents and \nproviding links to guidance documents). \n\n189a \n \nGrimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 721 \n(4th Cir. 2016) (stating that the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare (“HEW”) adopted its Title IX \nregulations  in  1975  pursuant  to  40  Fed.  Reg.  24,128 \n(June 4, 1975), and DOE implemented its regulations in \n1980  pursuant  to  45  Fed.  Reg.  30802,  30955  (May  9, \n1980)). Section 106.33, as well as several other related \nregulations, permit educational institutions to separate \nstudents on the basis of sex, provided the separate ac-\ncommodations are comparable.(cid:2) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  The Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”) \n“The APA authorizes suit by ‘[a] person suffering le-\ngal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affect-\ned or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a \nrelevant statute.’ ” Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., \n542 U.S. 55, 61 (2004) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702). “Where \nno other statute provides a private right of action, the \n‘agency action’ complained of must be final agency ac-\ntion.’ ” Id. at 61–62 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704).6 In the Fifth \n                                                   \n6 Agency action is defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(13) to include “the whole \nor a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \nequivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.” Norton v. S. Utah \nWilderness  Alliance,  542  U.S.  55,  62  (2004)  (quoting  5  U.S.C. \n§ 551(13)). “All of those categories involve circumscribed, discrete \nagency actions, as their definitions make clear: ‘an agency statement \nof . . . future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe \nlaw or policy’ (rule); ‘a final disposition . . . in a matter other than \nrule making’ (order); a ‘permit . . . or other form of permission’ (li-\ncense); a ‘prohibition . . . or . . . taking [of] other compulsory or re-\nstrictive action’ (sanction); or a ‘grant of money, assistance, license, \nauthority,’ etc., or ‘recognition of a claim, right, immunity,’ etc., or \nContinued … \n\n190a \n \nCircuit, “final agency action” is a jurisdictional threshold, \nnot a merits inquiry. Texas v. Equal Employment Op-\nportunity Comm’n, No. 14-10949, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5 \n(5th Cir. June 27, 2016) (“EEOC”); see also Peoples Nat’l \nBank v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the \nUnited States, 362 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir. 2004) (“If there \nis no ‘final agency action,’ a federal court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction.” (citing Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Her-\nman, 176 F.3d 283, 287 (5th Cir. 1999))).  \nAn administrative action is “final agency action” un-\nder the APA if: (1) the agency’s action is the “consumma-\ntion of the agency’s decision making process;” and (2) \n“the action [is] one by which ‘rights or obligations have \nbeen determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will \nflow.’ ”  Bennett  v.  Spear,  520  U.S.  154,  177–78  (1997) \n(quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Water-\nman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948); and Port of \nBoston  Marine  Terminal  Assn.  v.  Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic,  400  U.S.  62,  71  (1970)).  “In  evaluating \nwhether  a  challenged  agency  action  meets  these  two \nconditions, this court is guided by the Supreme Court’s \ninterpretation of the APA’s finality requirement as ‘flex-\nible’ and ‘pragmatic.’ ” EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242, at *5; \nQureshi  v.  Holder,  663  F.3d  778,  781  (5th  Cir.  2011) \n(quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149–50 \n(1967)). When final agency actions are presented for ju-\ndicial review, the APA provides that reviewing courts \nshould hold unlawful and set aside agency action that is \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n                                                                                                        \n‘taking of other action on the application or petition of, and benefi-\ncial to, a person’ (relief).” Id.

Preliminary Injunction \nThe Fifth Circuit set out the requirements for a pre-\nliminary injunction in Canal Authority of State of Flori-\nda v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974). To pre-\nvail on a preliminary injunction, the movant must show: \n(1) a substantial likelihood that the movant will ultimate-\nly prevail on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that the \nmovant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is \nnot granted; (3) that the threatened injury to the movant \noutweighs  whatever  damage  the  proposed  injunction \nmay cause the opposing party; and (4) that granting the \ninjunction is not adverse to the public interest. Id.; see \nalso Nichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc., 532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th \nCir. 2008).  \nTo qualify for a preliminary injunction, the movant \nmust clearly carry the burden of persuasion with respect \nto all four requirements. Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perus-\nahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, \n335 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2003). If the movant fails to \nestablish any one of the four prerequisites to injunctive \nrelief, relief will not be granted. Women’s Med. Ctr. of \nNw. Hous. v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 n.15 (5th Cir. 2001). \nA  movant  who  obtains  a  preliminary  injunction  must \npost a bond to secure the non-movant against any wrong-\nful damages it suffers as a result of the injunction. Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(c).  \nThe decision to grant or deny preliminary injunctive \nrelief is left to the sound discretion of the district court. \nMiss. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., \n\n192a \n \n760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 1985) (citing Canal, 489 F.2d \nat 572). A preliminary injunction “is an extraordinary \nand drastic remedy, not to be granted routinely, but only \nwhen the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden \nof persuasion.” White v. Carlucci, 862 F.2d 1209, 1211 \n(5th Cir. 1989) (quoting Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succes-\nsion of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir. 1985)). Even \nwhen a movant satisfies each of the four Canal factors, \nthe decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary in-\njunction  remains  discretionary  with  the  district  court. \nMiss. Power & Light Co., 760 F.2d at 621. The decision \nto grant a preliminary injunction is to be treated as the \nexception rather than the rule. Id.  \nIII. ANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs argue that: (1) Defendants skirted the no-\ntice and comment process—a necessity for legislative \nrules; (2) the new mandates are incompatible with Title \nVII and Title IX and the agencies are not entitled to def-\nerence; (3) the mandates violate the clear notice and anti-\ncoercion  requirements  which  the  federal  government \nmay attach to spending programs; and (4) nationwide \nrelief is necessary to prevent the irreparable harm De-\nfendants will cause Plaintiffs. Mot. Injunction 2–3, ECF \nNo. 11.  \nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs are not entitled to a \npreliminary injunction because: (1) Plaintiffs do not have \nstanding to bring their claims; (2) this matter is not ripe \nfor review; (3) Defendants’ Guidelines do not violate the \nAPA; (4) Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate irreparable harm \nand they have an alternative remedy; (5) Defendants did \nnot violate the Spending Clause; (6) and an injunction \nwould harm Defendants and third parties. Defs.’ Resp. \n\n193a \n \n1–3, ECF No. 40. Defendants allege that should an in-\njunction be granted, it should be implemented only to \nPlaintiffs in the Fifth Circuit. Id. The Court addresses \nthese issues, beginning with Defendants’ jurisdictional \narguments.7 \nA.  Jurisdiction \n  1.  Standing \nDefendants allege that “[P]laintiffs’ suit fails the ju-\nrisdictional requirements of standing and ripeness . . . \nbecause they have not alleged a cognizable concrete or \nimminent injury.” Defs.’ Resp. 12, ECF No. 40 (citing \nLopez v. City of Hous., 617 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. 2015)). \nDefendants allege “a plaintiff must demonstrate that it \nhas ‘suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particular-\nized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypo-\nthetical.’ ” Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S.  555,  560  (1992)).  Defendants  contend  that  “[t]he \n                                                   \n7 The parties have requested that the Court provide expedited con-\nsideration of the preliminary injunction. The briefing on this request \nwas completed on August 3, 2016, and the matter was not ripe until \nafter the hearing was completed on August 12, 2016. Because fur-\nther legal issues concerning the basis for Plaintiffs’ Spending Clause \nclaim were raised at the hearing and require further briefing, the \nCourt will not await that briefing at this time. See Hr’g Tr. 35, 44, \n52–53 (discussing new program requirements and whether a new \nprogram is the same as annual grants). Therefore, the Spending \nClause issue is not addressed in this Order. See ECF Nos. 11–12. \nFinally, where referenced, Title VII is used to help explain the legis-\nlative intent and purpose of Title IX because the two statutes are \ncommonly linked. N. Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 546 \n(1982).  \n\n194a \n \nagencies have merely set forth their views as to what the \nlaw requires” regarding whether gender identity is in-\ncluded  in  the  definition  of  sex,  and  “[a]t  this  stage, \n[P]laintiffs have alleged no more than an abstract disa-\ngreement with the agencies’ interpretation of the law,” \nsince “[n]o concrete situation has emerged that would \npermit the Court to evaluate [P]laintiffs’ claims in terms \nof specific facts rather than abstract principles.” Id. at \n13–14.  \nDefendants  also  allege  that  Plaintiffs  “have  [not] \nidentified any enforcement action to which they are or \nare about to be subject in which a defendant agency is \nseeking to enforce its view of the law. As such, any injury \nalleged by plaintiffs is entirely speculative, as it depend-\ned on the initiation of some kind of enforcement action \n. . . which may never occur.” Defs.’ Resp. 14, ECF No. \n40.  \nPlaintiffs state that Defendants are affirmatively us-\ning the Guidelines to force compliance as evidenced by \nvarious resolution agreements reached in enforcement \ncases across the country and from the litigation against \nthe state of North Carolina, all of which is designed to \nforce Plaintiffs to amend their policies to comply or place \ntheir federal funding in jeopardy. Hr’g Tr. at 78. Plain-\ntiffs argue they are clearly the object of the Defendants’ \nGuidelines, and those directives run afoul of various state \nconstitutional and statutory codes which permit Plain-\ntiffs to exercise control of their education premises and \nfacilities.8 Hr’g Tr. at 77. Plaintiffs contend all of this \n                                                   \n8 Plaintiffs’ motion provides the following citations to their state laws \nwhich give them legal control over the management of the safety \nand security policies of educational buildings in their states and \nContinued … \n\n195a \n \n                                                                                                        \nwhich the Guidelines will compel them to disregard.

Hr’g Tr. 78.  \nDefendants counter that EEOC was wrongly decided \nand, regardless, the facts here are distinguishable from \nthat  case.9 Id. Defendants primarily distinguish EEOC \nfrom this case based on the EEOC majority’s view that \nthe “guidance [at issue] contained a ‘safe harbor’ [provi-\nsion]” and “the [guidance at issue had] the immediate \neffect of altering the rights and obligations of the ‘regu-\nlated community’ . . . by offering them [] detailed and \nconclusive means to avoid an adverse EEOC finding.” \nDefs.’ Resp. 15, ECF No. 40. Defendants claim that the \nsame kind of facts are not present here. Defendants con-\ntend further that “the [transgender] guidance documents \ndo  not  provide  ‘an  exhaustive  procedural  framework,’ \n[or] . . . a safe harbor, but merely express[] the agencies’ \nopinion about the proper interpretation of Title VII and \nTitle IX.” Id. Thus, they argue, the Court lacks jurisdic-\n                                                                                                        \ntrol over local school property.”); Ky. Rev.

City of San An-\ntonio,  718  F.3d  469,  473  (5th  Cir.  2013)  (quoting  Elk \nGrove  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  11 \n(2004)).  Constitutional  standing  requires  a  plaintiff  to \nestablish that she has suffered an injury in fact traceable \nto the defendant’s actions that will be redressed by a fa-\nvorable ruling. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61. The injury in \nfact must be “concrete and particularized” and “actual or \nimminent,”  as  opposed  to  “conjectural”  or  “hypothet-\nical.” Id. at 560. When “a plaintiff can establish that it is \nan ‘object’ of the agency regulation at issue, ‘there is or-\ndinarily  little  question  that  the  action  or  inaction  has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing or requiring the action will redress it.’ ” EEOC, \n2016 WL 3524242 at *2; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62. The \nFifth Circuit provided, “[w]hether someone is in fact an \nobject of a regulation is a flexible inquiry rooted in com-\nmon sense.” Id. at *6 (quoting Contender Farms LLP v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 265 (5th Cir. 2015)).  \nIn EEOC, Texas sued the EEOC over employment \nguidance  the  EEOC  issued  to  employers  concerning \ntheir Title VII obligations. In response, the EEOC ar-\ngued Texas lacked standing because the guidance was \nadvisory only and imposed no affirmative obligation. The \n                                                   \n10 The Court addresses Defendants’ claim that Plaintiffs have an \nadequate alternate remedy in Section III.A.4. \n\n199a \n \nFifth Circuit held that Texas had standing to seek relief \nbecause it was an object of the EEOC’s guidance as the \nguidance applied to Texas as an employer. Id. at *4.  \nThis case is analogous. Defendants’ Guidelines are \nclearly  designed  to  target  Plaintiffs’  conduct.  At  the \nhearing, Defendants conceded that using the definition \nin the Guidelines means Plaintiffs are not in compliance \nwith their Title VII and Title IX obligations. Hr’g Tr. 74. \nDefendants argue that that this does not confer standing \nbecause the Guidelines are advisory only. Defs.’ Resp. \n14, ECF No. 40. But this conflates standing with final \nagency action and the Fifth Circuit instructed district \ncourts  to  address  the  two  concepts  separately.  See \nEEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *3. Defendants’ Guidelines \ndirect  Plaintiffs  to  alter  their  policies  concerning  stu-\ndents’ access to single sex toilet, locker room, and show-\ner  facilities,  forcing  them  to  redefine  who  may  enter \napart from traditional biological considerations.11 Plain-\ntiffs’ counsel argued the Guidelines will force Plaintiffs to \nconsider  ways  to  build  or  reconstruct  restrooms,  and \nhow to accommodate students who may seek to use pri-\nvate single person facilities, as other school districts and \nemployers who have been subjected to Defendants’ en-\nforcement actions have had to do. Hr’g Tr. 80–81. That \nthe  Guidelines  spur  this  added  regulatory  compliance \n                                                   \n11 For example, Plaintiffs list Wisconsin’s state statutes regarding \nthis  matter,  which  state  that  school  boards  are  required  to \n“[p]rovide and maintain enough suitable and separate toilets and \nother sanitary facilities for both sexes.” Mot. Injunction 10 n.9, ECF \nNo. 11 (citing Wis. Stat. s. 120.12(12)). Plaintiffs interpret this to \nmean that Wisconsin has the authority to maintain separate intimate \nfacilities that correspond to a person’s biological sex. Id. \n\n200a \n \nanalysis satisfies the injury in fact requirement. EEOC, \n2016 WL 3524242 at *4 (“[T]he guidance does, at the \nvery least, force Texas to undergo an analysis, agency by \nagency, regarding whether the certainty of EEOC inves-\ntigations . . . overrides the State’s interest . . . . [T]hese \ninjuries are sufficient to confer constitutional standing, \nespecially when considering Texas’s unique position as a \nsovereign state . . . .”). That Plaintiffs have standing is \nstrengthened by the fact that Texas and other Plaintiffs \nhave a “stake in protecting [their] quasi-sovereign inter-\nests . . . [as] special solicitude[s].” Mass. v. E.P.A., 549 \nU.S. 497, 520 (2007) (“Congress has moreover recognized \na concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection \nof its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious. \n§ 7607(b)(1). Given that procedural right and Massachu-\nsetts’ stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, \nthe Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude in our \nstanding analysis.”).  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to pursue this \nlawsuit.  \n  2.  Ripeness \nDefendants also argue that this case is not ripe for \nreview. According to Defendants, this Court should avoid \npremature adjudication to avoid entangling itself in ab-\nstract disagreements over administrative policies. Defs.’ \nResp. 13, ECF No. 40 (citing Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. \nDep.’t Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807 (2003)). Defendants ar-\ngue that more time should be given to allow the adminis-\ntrative process to run its course and develop more facts \nbefore the Court can address this case. Id. at 13 (citing \nAbbott Labs, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)); Hr’g Tr. 62. Plain-\ntiffs  counter  that,  taking  into  account  recent  events \nwhere Defendants have investigated other entities that \n\n201a \n \ndo not comply with the Guidelines, this case is ripe. Pls.’ \nReply 4–7, ECF No. 52; Hr’g Tr. 79.  \n“A challenge to administrative regulations is fit for \nreview if (1) the questions presented are ‘purely legal \none[s],’  (2)  the  challenged  regulations  constitute  ‘final \nagency  action,’  and  (3)  further  factual  development \nwould not ‘significantly advance [the court’s] ability to \ndeal with the legal issues presented.’ ” Texas v. United \nStates, 497 F.3d 491, 498–99 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Nat’l \nPark Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 812).  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ case is ripe for re-\nview. Here, the parties agree that the questions at issue \nare purely legal. Hr’g Tr. 61. Defendants asserted at the \nhearing that Plaintiffs are not in compliance with their \nobligations under Title IX given their refusal to change \ntheir policies. Hr’g Tr. 74. Furthermore, for the reasons \nset out below, the Court finds that Defendants’ actions \namount to final agency action under the APA.12 EEOC, \n2016 WL 3524242 at *11 n.9 (“Having determined that \nthe Guidance is ‘final agency action’ under the APA, it \nfollows naturally that Texas’s APA claim is ripe for re-\nview. Texas’s challenge to the EEOC Guidance is a pure-\nly legal one, and as such it is unnecessary to wait for fur-\nther factual development before rendering a decision.”) \n(Internal citations omitted).  \nFinally, the facts of this case have sufficiently devel-\noped to address the legal impact Defendants’ Guidelines \nhave on Plaintiffs’ legal questions in this case. Texas, 497 \nF.3d at 498–99. The only other factual development that \nmay occur, given Defendants’ conclusion Plaintiffs are \n                                                   \n12 The Court further addresses this issue in section III.A.3. \n\n202a \n \nnot in legal compliance, is whether Defendants actually \nseek to take action against Plaintiffs. But it is not clear \nhow waiting for Defendants to actually take action would \n“significantly advance [the court’s] ability to deal with \nthe legal issues presented.” Texas, 497 F.3d at 498–99. \nAs previously stated, Defendants’ Guidelines clash with \nPlaintiffs’  state  laws  and  policies  in  relation  to  public \nschool facilities and Plaintiffs have called into question \nthe legality of those Guidelines. Mot. Injunction 9–12, \nECF  No.  11.  Therefore,  “further  factual  development \nwould not ‘significantly advance the courts ability to deal \nwith  the  legal  issues  presented.’”  Texas,  497  F.3d  at \n498−99. Accordingly, the Court finds that this case is \nripe for review.  \n  3.  Final Agency Action under the APA \nThe Court now evaluates whether the Guidelines are \nfinal agency action meeting the jurisdictional threshold \nunder the APA. EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5. Defend-\nants argue that there has been no final agency action as \nthe documents in question are merely “paradigmatic in-\nterpretive rules, exempt from the notice-and-comment \nrequirements of the APA.” Defs.’ Resp. 18, ECF No. 40. \nDefendants also allege that the Guidelines are “[v]alid \ninterpretations of the statutory and regulatory authori-\nties on which they are premised” because although Title \nIX and § 106.33 provide that federal recipients may pro-\nvide for separate, comparable facilities, the regulation \nand  statute  “do  not  address  how  they  apply  when  a \ntransgender student seeks to use those facilities . . . .” Id. \nat 20−21.  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  agencies’  Guidelines  are \nbinding  nationwide  and  the  Defendants’  enforcement \npatterns in various states clearly demonstrate that legal \n\n203a \n \nactions against those that do not comply will follow. Mot. \nInjunction 9–12, ECF No. 11; Reply 2–8, ECF No. 52. \nPlaintiffs identify a number of similar cases where De-\nfendants have investigated schools that refused to com-\nply with the new Guidelines and where they sued North \nCarolina over its state law which, in part, made it legal to \nrequire a person to use the public restroom according to \ntheir biological sex. Reply 6, ECF No. 52.  \nAn administrative action is “final agency action” un-\nder the APA if: (1) the agency’s action is the “consumma-\ntion of the agency’s decision making process;” and (2) \n“the action [is] one by which ‘rights or obligations have \nbeen determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will \nflow.’”  Bennett,  520  U.S.  at  177–78.  “In  evaluating \nwhether  a  challenged  agency  action  meets  these  two \nconditions, the court is guided by the Supreme Court’s \ninterpretation of the APA’s finality requirement as ‘flex-\nible’ and ‘pragmatic.’ ” EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5 \n(quoting Qureshi v. Holder, 663 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir. \n2011)).  \nThe Court finds that the Guidelines are final agency \naction under the APA. Defendants do not dispute that \nthe Guidelines are a “consummation” of the agencies’ de-\ncision-making process. Hr’g Tr. 61; Nat’l Pork Produc-\ners  Council  v.  E.P.A.,  635  F.3d  738,  755–56  (5th  Cir. \n2011) (citing Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario \nv. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 912 F.2d 1525, 1532 (D.C. Cir. \n1990) (deciding that EPA guidance letters constitute fi-\nnal agency actions as they “serve[d] to confirm a defini-\ntive position that has a direct and immediate impact on \nthe parties . . . .”)).  \nThe second consideration is also satisfied in this case \nbecause legal consequences flow from the Defendants’ \n\n204a \n \nactions. Defendants argue no legal consequences flow to \nPlaintiffs because there has been no enforcement action, \nor threat of enforcement action. Hr’g Tr. 71. The Fifth \nCircuit held in EEOC however that “an agency action \ncan create legal consequences even when the action, in \nitself, is disassociated with the filing of an enforcement \nproceeding, and is not authority for the imposition of civil \nor criminal penalties.” 2016 WL 3524242 at *8. According \nto the Fifth Circuit, “‘legal consequences’ are created \nwhenever the challenged agency action has the effect of \ncommitting the agency itself to a view of the law that, in \nturn, forces the plaintiff either to alter its conduct, or ex-\npose itself to potential liability.” Id. (citing U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1814–15 \n(May  31,  2016)  (holding  that  using  the  pragmatic  ap-\nproach, an agency action asserting that plaintiff’s land \nwas subject to the Clean Water Act’s permitting process \nwas  a  final  agency  action  which  carried  legal  conse-\nquences). The Fifth Circuit concluded that “[i]t is also \nsufficient  that  the  Enforcement  Guidance  [at  issue  in \nEEOC] has the immediate effect of altering the rights \nand obligations of the ‘regulated community’ (i.e. virtual-\nly all state and private employers) by offering them a de-\ntailed and conclusive means to avoid an adverse EEOC \nfinding . . . .” 2016 WL 3524242 at * 6.  \nIn this case, although the Guidelines provide no safe \nharbor provision, the DOJ/DOE Letter provides not only \nmust Plaintiffs permit individuals to use the restrooms, \nlocker rooms, showers, and housing consistent with their \ngender  identity,  but  that  they  find  no  safe  harbor  in \nproviding transgender students individual-user facilities \nas an alternative accommodation. Indeed, the Guidelines \nprovide that schools may, consistent with Title IX, make \n\n205a \n \nindividual-user  facilitates  available  for  other  students \nwho “voluntarily seek additional privacy.” See DOJ/DOE \nLetter 3, ECF No. 6-10. Using a pragmatic and common \nsense approach, Defendants’ Guidelines and actions indi-\ncate  that  Plaintiffs  jeopardize  their  federal  education \nfunding  by  choosing  not  to  comply  with  Defendants’ \nGuidelines.13 EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *8 (“Instead, \n‘legal  consequences’  are  created  whenever  the  chal-\nlenged agency action has the effect of committing the \nagency itself to a view of the law that, in turn, forces the \nplaintiff either to alter its conduct, or expose itself to po-\ntential liability.”); Resident Council of Allen Parkway \nVill. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 980 F.2d 1043, \n1056–57  (5th  Cir.  1993)  (stating  that  “[w]ere  HUD  to \nformally define the phrase [at issue] . . . [the plaintiffs] \nwould undoubtedly have the right to review HUD’s final \nagency action under § 702 [of the APA]”); Frozen Foods \nExpress v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44–45 (1956) (hold-\ning an order specifying which commodities the Interstate \nCommerce Commission believed were exempt was final \nagency action, even though the order simply gave notice \nof how it would interpret the statute and would apply on-\nly when an action was brought): compare with AT&T Co. \nv. E.E.O.C., 27 F.3d 973, 975–76 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (holding \nthat  the  EEOC’s  compliance  manual  was  not  a  final \nagency action because the policy guidance did not intend \n                                                   \n13  The  Holder  Memorandum  concludes,  “For  these  reasons,  the \n[DOJ] will no longer assert that Title VII’s prohibition of discrimi-\nnation based on sex does not encompass gender identity per se (in-\ncluding transgender discrimination).” Holder Memo 2, ECF No. 6-3. \nOther  guidance  from  Defendants  take  similar  actions.  See  also \nDOJ/DOE Letter 4–5, ECF No. 6-10. \n\n206a \n \nto bind EEOC staff in their official conduct, the manual \nsimply expressed the agency’s view with respect to em-\nployers’ actions and compliance with Title VII).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Defendants’ Guide-\nlines are final agency action such that the jurisdictional \nthreshold is met. EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5.  \n  4.  Alternative Legal Remedy \nDefendants also contend that district court review is \nprecluded and Plaintiffs should not be allowed to avoid \nthe administrative process by utilizing the APA at this \ntime. Defs.’ Resp. 16, ECF No. 40. Defendants allege \nthat “review by a court of appeals is an ‘adequate reme-\ndy’ within the meaning of the APA,” and “[s]ection 704 of \nthe APA thus prevents plaintiffs from circumventing the \nadministrative  and  judicial  process  Congress  provided \nthem.” Id. Defendants argue “Congress has precluded \ndistrict court jurisdiction over pre-enforcement actions \nlike this.” Id. at 17. Defendants cite several cases, includ-\ning the Supreme Court’s opinions in Thunder Basin v. \nReich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994) and Elgin v. Department of \nTreasury, 132 S. Ct. 2126 (2012), in support of this ar-\ngument.14 \n                                                   \n14 Defendants also assert NAACP v. Meese supports this argument \nbut the Court disagrees. In that case, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin \nthe Attorney General from reopening or agreeing to reopen any \nconsent decree in any civil rights action pending in any other court. \nThe district court denied this request, holding such actions would \nviolate principles of separation of powers and comity. 615 F. Supp. \n200, 201–02 (D.D.C. 1985) (“Plaintiffs’ action must fail (1) under the \nprinciple of the separation of powers, and (2) because this Court \nlacks authority to interfere with or to seek to guide litigation in oth-\ner district courts throughout the United States.”). The Meese court \nContinued … \n\n207a \n \nDefendants’ assertion that there is no jurisdiction to \nreview Plaintiffs’ APA claims fails and their reliance on \nThunder Basin, Elgin, and the other cited cases is mis-\nplaced. In Thunder Basin, the Supreme Court held that \nthe Mine Act’s statutory review scheme precluded the \ndistrict court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction \nover a pre-enforcement challenge. To determine whether \npre-enforcement challenges are prohibited courts look to \nwhether this “intent is ‘fairly discernible in the statutory \nscheme.’ ”  Thunder  Basin,  510  U.S.  at  207  (quoting \nBlock v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, \n351 (1984)). The Supreme Court held that “[w]hether a \nstatute is intended to preclude initial judicial review is \ndetermined from the statute’s language, structure, and \npurpose,  its  legislative  history  . . .  and  whether  the \nclaims can be afforded meaningful review.” Id. (internal \ncitation omitted).  \nAlthough  the  Mine  Act  was  silent  about  pre-\nenforcement claims, the Supreme Court held that “its \ncomprehensive  enforcement  structure  demonstrate[d] \nthat Congress intended to preclude challenges,” and the \nMine Act “expressly authorize[d] district court jurisdic-\ntion in only two provisions . . . [which allowed] the Secre-\ntary [of Labor] to enjoin [] violations of health and safety \nstandards and to coerce payment of civil penalties.” Id. \n                                                                                                        \nalso concluded there was no final agency action to enjoin and, by \ndefinition, there would be an alternative legal remedy related to \nthose cases where a consent decree existed because those decrees \nwere already subject to a presiding judge. Id. at 203 n.9. Additional-\nly, Defendants reliance on Dist. Adult Prob. Dep’t v. Dole, 948 F.2d \n953 (5th Cir. 1991) does not apply because there was no final agency \naction in that case.  \n\n208a \n \nat 209. Thus, plaintiffs had to “complain to the Commis-\nsion and then to the court of appeals.” Id. (italics omit-\nted).  \nElgin reached a similar conclusion, holding that the \nCivil Service Reform Act (“CSRA”) was the exclusive \navenue to judicial review for petitioners’ claims against \nthe Treasury Department. 132 S. Ct. 2126, 2128 (“Just as \nthe  CSRA’s  ‘elaborate’  framework  [citation  omitted] \ndemonstrates Congress’ intent to entirely foreclose judi-\ncial review to employees to whom the CSRA denies stat-\nutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory \nreview is not available to those employees to whom the \nCSRA grants administrative and judicial review.”).  \nNo similar elaborate statutory framework exists cov-\nering Plaintiffs’ claims. Neither Title VII nor Title IX \npresents statutory schemes that would preclude Plain-\ntiffs from bringing these claims in federal district court. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has held that Title IX’s en-\nforcement provisions, codified at Title 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–\n1683, does not provide the exclusive statutory remedy \nfor violations. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. \n677 (1979) (holding that Title IX did not preclude a pri-\nvate right of action for damages). Given Defendants lack \nof authority to the contrary, the presumption of reviewa-\nbility  for  all  agency  actions  applies.  EEOC,  2016  WL \n3524242 at *11 (citing Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140) (“To \nwholly deny judicial review, however, would be to ignore \nthe presumption of reviewability, and to disregard the \nSupreme Court’s instruction that courts should adopt a \npragmatic approach for the purposes of determining re-\nviewability under the APA.”).  \n\n209a \n \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs claims are properly \nsubject  to  judicial  review,  the  Court  next  evaluates \nwhether a preliminary injunction is appropriate.  \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \n  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe  first  consideration  is  whether  Plaintiffs  have \nshown  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  for  their \nclaims. Plaintiffs aver that they have shown a substantial \nlikelihood that they will prevail on the merits because \nDefendants have violated the APA by (1) circumventing \nthe notice and comment process and (2) by issuing final \nagency action that is contrary to law. Mot. Injunction 12–\n16, ECF No. 11. Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants’ new policies are not valid agency interpreta-\ntions  that  should  be  granted  deference  because \n“[a]gencies do not receive deference where a new inter-\npretation conflicts with a prior interpretation.” Pls.’ Re-\nply 11, ECF No. 52 (citing Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. \nShalala, 512 U.S. 504, 515 (1994)).  \nDefendants contend that their actions do not violate \nthe APA because the Guidelines are interpretive rules \nand are therefore exempt from the notice and comment \nrequirements. Defs.’ Resp. 12–18, ECF No. 40. Defend-\nants argue the Guidelines are exempt because they do \nnot carry the force of law, even though “the agencies’ in-\nterpretations of the law are entitled to some deference.” \nFurther, they argue because their interpretation is rea-\nsonable, this interpretation is entitled to deference.15 De-\n                                                   \n15 Defendants argue the Court should be guided in this decision by \nthe Fourth Circuit’s decision in G.G. ex rel Grimm v. Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016) (“G.G.”). Defendants con-\nContinued … \n\n210a \n \nfendants also assert they did not act contrary to law be-\ncause the Guidelines are valid interpretations of Title IX \nas the statute and regulations “do not address how [the \nlaws] apply when a transgender student seeks to use \nthose  facilities”  or  “how  a  school  should  determine  a \ntransgender student’s sex when providing access to sex-\n                                                                                                        \ntend the Fourth Circuit’s majority opinion in G.G. should be fol-\nlowed as it provides the proper analysis. The Supreme Court re-\ncalled the Fourth Circuit’s mandate and stayed the preliminary in-\njunction entered by the district court in that case. See Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm, No. 16-A-52, 2016 WL 4131636 \nat *1 (Aug. 3, 2016) (Breyer, J. concurring) (“In light of the facts \nthat four Justices have voted to grant the application referred to the \nCourt by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, that we are currently in recess, \nand that granting a stay will preserve the status quo (as of the time \nthe Court of Appeals made its decision) until the Court considers the \nforthcoming petition for certiorari, I vote to grant the application as \na courtesy.”). The Supreme Court takes such actions only on the \nrarest of occasions. Bd. of Ed. of City School Dist. of City of New \nRochelle v. Taylor, 82 S.Ct. 10, 10 (1961) (“On such an application, \nsince the Court of Appeals refused the stay ‘* * * this court requires \nan extraordinary showing, before it will grant a stay of the decree \nbelow pending the application for a certiorari.”); Russo v. Byrne, 409 \nU.S. 1219, 1221 (1972) (“If the application presents frivolous ques-\ntions it should be denied. If it tenders a ruling out of harmony with \nour prior decisions, or questions of transcending public importance, \nor issues which would likely induce this Court to grant certiorari, \nthe stay should be granted.”). Because it is impossible to know the \nprecise issue(s) that prompted the Supreme Court to grant the stay, \nit is difficult to conclude that G.G. would control the outcome here. \nSee New Motor Vehicle Bd. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 \n(1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (declaring it is very difficult to \npredict  anticipated  Supreme  Court  decision).  Nevertheless,  the \nCourt has reviewed the opinion and considers the well-expressed \nviews of each member of the panel in reaching the decision in this \ncase.  \n\n211a \n \nsegregated facilities.” Id. at 20–21. Thus, according to \nDefendants, this situation presents an ambiguity in the \nregulatory scheme and Defendants are allowed to pro-\nvide guidelines to federal fund recipients on this matter. \nId. at 21.16 \nIn their Reply, Plaintiffs counter that DOE’s imple-\nmenting regulation, § 106.33, is not “ambiguous[,] [a]s a \nphysiologically-grounded regulation, it covers every hu-\nman being and therefor all those within the reach of Title \nIX.” Reply 8, ECF No. 52. They contend further, “[t]o \ncreate legal room to undo what Congress (and preceding \nregulators) had done, Defendants manufacture an ambi-\nguity,  claiming  that  ‘these  regulations  do  not  address \nhow they apply when a transgender student seeks to use \nthose facilities . . . .’ ” Id. (citing Defs.’ Response 20–21, \nECF No. 40). Plaintiffs continue, “[i]n enacting Title IX, \nCongress was concerned that women receive the same \nopportunities as men, [t]hus, Congress utilized ‘sex’ in an \nexclusively biological context[,] [and] “[t]he two sexes are \nnot  fungible.”  Id.  at  8–9  (quoting  Ballard  v.  United \nStates, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946). It is the biological dif-\nferences between men and women, Plaintiffs allege, that \nled Congress in 1972 to “permit differential treatment by \nsex only[,]” provide a basis for DOE “to approve ‘sepa-\nrate toilet, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the ba-\nsis of sex” in § 106.33, and led the Supreme Court “to \nconclude that educational institutions must ‘afford mem-\n                                                   \n16 Defendants characterize their Guidelines as, “supply[ing] ‘crisper \nand more detailed lines’ than the statutes and regulations that they \ninterpret,” without “alter[ing] the legal obligations of regulated enti-\nties.” Id. at 20 (citing Am. Mining Cong. Mine Safety & Health \nAdmin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).  \n\n212a \n \nbers of each sex privacy from the other sex.’” Id. at 9 \n(quoting 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972)); United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S., 550 n.19 (1996)).  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a likeli-\nhood of success on the merits because: (1) Defendants \nbypassed the notice and comment process required by \nthe APA; (2) Title IX and § 106.33’s text is not ambigu-\nous; and (3) Defendants are not entitled to agency defer-\nence under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997).17 \n    i. Notice and Comment under the APA \nDefendants state that “[t]he APA does not require \nagencies to follow notice and comment procedures in all \nsituations [, and the APA] specifically excludes interpre-\ntive rules and statements of agency policy from these \nprocedures.” Defs.’ Resp. 17–18, ECF No. 40. Defend-\nants allege “[t]he guidance documents are . . . paradig-\nmatic  interpretive  rules,  exempt  from  the  notice-and-\ncomment requirements of the APA.” Id. at 18. According \nto Defendants, “the interpretations themselves do not \ncarry the force of law . . . .” Id. at 19. Defendants rely on \nG.G., 822 F.3d 709, 720 (4th Cir. 2016) to support their \nclaim that DOE’s “interpretation of the single-sex facili-\nty regulation implementing Title IX is reasonable, and \ndoes not conflict with those regulations in any way.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants’ rules are legisla-\ntive because: “(1) they grant rights while also imposing \nsignificant obligations; (2) they amend prior legislative \n                                                   \n17 Defendants’ counsel stated at the hearing that Defendants would \nnot be entitled to Chevron deference for the Guidelines. See Hr’g Tr. \n72. Thus, the Court addresses only Defendants’ claim that they are \nentitled to Auer deference when interpreting § 106.33.  \n\n213a \n \nrules or longstanding agency practice; and (3) bind the \nagencies and regulated entities,” requiring them to go \nthrough the notice and comment process. Mot. Injunc-\ntion 12, ECF No. 11.  \nThe APA requires agency rules to be published in the \nFederal Register and that the public be given an oppor-\ntunity to comment on them. 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b)−(c). This \nis referred to as the notice and comment requirement. \nThe purpose is to permit the agency to understand and \nperhaps adjust its rules based on the comments of af-\nfected individuals. Prof’ls and Patients for Customized \nCare v. Shalala, 56 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir. 1995). Howev-\ner, not every action an agency takes is required to go \nthrough the notice and comment process. “The APA di-\nvides agency action, as relevant here, into three boxes: \nlegislative  rules,  interpretive  rules,  and  general  state-\nments of policy.” Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d \n243, 251 (D.C. Cir. 2014). “Legislative rules generally re-\nquire  notice  and  comment,  but  interpretive  rules  and \ngeneral statements of policy do not.” Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553). “In order for a regulation to have the ‘force and \neffect of law,’ it must have certain substantive character-\nistics and be the product of certain procedural requi-\nsites.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301–03, \n(1979).  \nThe APA does not define a legislative or “substan-\ntive”  rule,  but  in  Morton  v.  Ruiz,  415  U.S.  199,  234 \n(1974), the Supreme Court held that a substantive rule or \n“a legislative-type rule,” is one that “affect[s] individual \nrights and obligations.” Id. at 232. The Supreme Court \nalso held, “the promulgation of these regulations must \nconform with any procedural requirements imposed by \nCongress.” Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. at 303. Thus, agency \n\n214a \n \ndiscretion is limited not only by substantive, statutory \ngrants of authority, but also by the procedural require-\nments which “assure fairness and mature consideration \nof rules of general application.” Id. (quoting NLRB v. \nWyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759 (1969)). If a rule is \nsubstantive, notice and comment requirements must be \nadhered to scrupulously. Prof’ls and Patients for Cus-\ntomized Care, 56 F.3d at 595. \n“[L]egislative  rules  (and  sometimes  interpretive \nrules) may be subject to pre-enforcement review” be-\ncause they subject a party to a binding obligation which \ncan be the subject of an enforcement action. McCarthy, \n758 F.3d at 251. (“An agency action that purports to im-\npose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regu-\nlated parties—and that would be the basis for an en-\nforcement action for violations of those obligations or re-\nquirements—is a legislative rule . . . .”). The APA treats \ninterpretive rules and general statements of policy dif-\nferently. Id. (“As to interpretive rules, an agency action \nthat merely interprets a prior statute or regulation, and \ndoes not itself purport to impose new obligations or pro-\nhibitions or requirements on regulated parties, is an in-\nterpretive rule.”).18 \nCourts have focused on several factors to evaluate \nwhether rules are interpretative or legislative. Courts \nanalyze  the  agency’s  characterization  of  the  guidance \nand  post-guidance  events  to  determine  whether  the \n                                                   \n18 Catawba Cty. provides: “An agency action that merely explains \nhow the agency will enforce a statute or regulation—in other words, \nhow it will exercise its broad enforcement discretion or permitting \ndiscretion under some extant statute or rule—is a general state-\nment of policy.”). \n\n215a \n \nagency has applied the guidance as if it were binding on \nregulated parties. McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252–53. How-\never, “the most important factor concerns the actual le-\ngal effect (or lack thereof) of the agency action in ques-\ntion on regulated entities.” McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252 \n(quoting Catawba Cty. v. EPA, 571 F.3d 20, 33–34; Gen. \nElec. Co. v. EPA, 290 F.3d 377, 382 (D.C. Cir. 2002)). “A \ntouchstone of a substantive rule is that it establishes a \nbinding  norm.”  Prof’ls  and  Patients  for  Customized \nCare, 56 F.3d at 596; see also Texas v. United States, 809 \nF.3d 134, 202 (5th Cir. 2015) (King, J., dissenting) (de-\nclaring that an agency action establishing binding norms \nwhich permit no discretion is a substantive rule requir-\ning notice and comment). If agency action “draws a ‘line \nin the sand’ that, once crossed, removes all discretion \nfrom the agency” the rule is substantive. Id. at 601.  \nHere, the Court finds that Defendants rules are leg-\nislative  and  substantive.  Although  Defendants  have \ncharacterized  the  Guidelines  as  interpretive,  post-\nguidance events and their actual legal effect prove that \nthey are “compulsory in nature.” See Appalachian Pow-\ner Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000);19 see \nalso Prof’ls and Patients for Customized Care, 56 F.3d \nat 596 (the label an agency places on its exercise of ad-\n                                                   \n19 In Appalachian Power, the D.C. Circuit held that an EPA guid-\nance was a legislative rule despite the guidance document’s state-\nment that it was advisory. The Court analyzed the document as a \nwhole and found that “the entire Guidance, from beginning to end—\nexcept the last paragraph—reads like a ukase. It commands, it re-\nquires, it orders, it dictates.” 208 F.3d at 1022–23. Similarly, the \nDOJ/DOE Letter uses the words “must,” and various forms of the \nword  “require”  numerous  times  throughout  the  document.  Am. \nCompl. Ex. J (DOJ/DOE Letter), ECF No. 6-10. \n\n216a \n \nministrative power is not conclusive, rather it is what the \nagency does with that policy that determines the type of \naction).  Defendants  confirmed  at  the  hearing  that \nschools not acting in conformity with Defendants’ Guide-\nlines are not in compliance with Title IX. Hr’g Tr. 71. \nFurther, post-Guidelines events, where Defendants have \nmoved to enforce the Guidelines as binding, buttress this \nconclusion. Id. at 7; Mot. Injunction 15–16, ECF No. 11; \nReply  4–8,  ECF  No.  52.  The  information  before  the \nCourt demonstrates Defendants have “drawn a line in \nthe sand” in that they have concluded Plaintiffs must \nabide by the Guidelines, without exception, or they are in \nbreach of their Title IX obligations. Thus, it would follow \nthat the “actual legal effect” of the Guidelines is to force \nPlaintiffs  to  risk  the  consequences  of  noncompliance. \nMcCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252; Catawba Cty., 571 F.3d at \n33–34; Gen. Elec. Co., 290 F.3d at 382; see also Nat’l \nAss’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 415 F.3d 8, 15 (D.C. \nCir. 2005). Plaintiffs, therefore, are legally affected in a \nway they were not before Defendants issued the Guide-\nlines. The Guidelines are, in practice, legislative rules—\nnot  just  interpretations  or  policy  statements  because \nthey  set  clear  legal  standards.  Panhandle  Producers \nand Royalty Owners Ass’n v. Econ. Regulatory Admin, \n847 F.2d 1168, 1174 (5th Cir. 1988) (stating that a sub-\nstantive rule is one that establishes standards of conduct \nthat carry the force of law). As such, Defendants should \nhave complied with the APA’s notice and comment re-\nquirement. 5 U.S.C. § 553; Nat’l Min. Ass’n, 758 F.3d at \n251; Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. at 301–03. Permitting the \ndefinition of sex to be defined in this way would allow \nDefendants to “create de facto new regulation” by agen-\ncy action without complying with the proper procedures. \n\n217a \n \nChristensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 586−88 (2000). \nThis is not permitted.  \nAccordingly  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  would \nlikely succeed on the merits that Defendants violated the \nnotice and comment requirements of the APA.  \nii.  Agency  Action  Contrary  to  Law  (5 \n      U.S.C. § 553) \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  Defendants’  Guidelines  are \ncontrary to the statutory and regulatory text, Congres-\nsional intent, and the plain meaning of the term. Mot. \nInjunction 14, ECF No. 11. When an agency acts contra-\nry  to  law,  its  action  must  be  set  aside.  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ interpreta-\ntion of the meaning of the term “sex” as set out in the \nGuidelines contradicts its meaning in Title VII, Title IX, \nand  § 106.33.  They  assert  “the  meaning  of  the  terms \n‘sex,’ on the one hand, and ‘gender identity,’ on the other, \nboth now and at the time Titles VII and IX were enact-\ned, forecloses alternate constructions.” Mot. Injunction \n16, ECF No. 11 (citing Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.S. \nat 512. They also allege that the ordinary meaning of the \nterm controls. Id. at 17 (citing Asgrow Seed Co. v. Win-\nterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995)).  \nDefendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs’  arguments  for \nlegislative history and intent at the time of passage are \nirrelevant. Hr’g Tr. 33 (“But it may very well be that \nCongress did not intend the law to protect transgender \nindividuals. [But,] . . . as the Supreme Court has made it \nabsolutely clear in Oncale, the fact that Congress may \nhave understood the term sex to mean anatomical sex at \nbirth is largely irrelevant.”) Defendants also allege that \n“Title IX and Title VII should be construed broadly” to \n\n218a \n \nprotect  any  person,  including  transgendered  persons, \nfrom discrimination. Hr’g Tr. 33–34.  \nThe starting point to analyze this dispute begins with \nthe actual text of the statute or regulation, where the \nwords should be given their ordinary meaning. Desert \nPalace,  Inc.  v.  Costa,  539  U.S.  90,  98  (2003)  (quoting \nConnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253– \n54 (1992)). When the words are unambiguous, the “judi-\ncial inquiry is complete.” Id. (quoting Rubin v. United \nStates, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981)). The pertinent statutory \ntext at issue in this case provides: “No person in the \nUnited States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject-\ned to discrimination under any education program or ac-\ntivity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  . . . .”  20 \nU.S.C. § 1681. Title IX expressly permits educational in-\nstitutions to maintain separate living facilities for the dif-\nferent sexes. Id. at § 1686. The other language at issue \ncomes from one of the DOE regulations promulgated to \nimplement Title IX, which states: “A recipient may pro-\nvide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students \nof one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided \nfor students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \nDefendants  assert  the  Guidelines  simply  provide \nclarity to an ambiguity in this regulation, and that ambi-\nguity is how to define the term sex when dealing with \ntransgendered students. Defs.’ Resp. 20, ECF No. 40. \nBecause they contend the regulation is ambiguous, De-\nfendants argue “[f]oundational principles of administra-\ntive law instruct [the Court] to give controlling weight to \n[their] interpretations of their own ambiguous regula-\ntions unless [they are] plainly erroneous.” Id.  \n\n219a \n \nPlaintiffs contend the text of both Title VII and Title \nIX is not ambiguous. Mot. Injunction 16–19, ECF No. 11. \nThey argue when Congress passed both statutes it clear-\nly intended sex to be defined based on the biological and \nanatomical differences between males and females. See \nid. at 17–18 (citing legislative history and common un-\nderstanding of its meaning at the time of passage). Plain-\ntiffs  likewise  assert  § 106.33  is  unambiguous,  for  the \nsame reason, as it was designed to separate students \nbased on their biological differences because they have a \nprivacy right to avoid exhibiting their “nude or partially \nnude  body,  genitalia,  and  other  private  parts”  before \nmembers of the opposite sex. Pls.’ Reply 8–9, ECF No. \n52. Based on this, they argue Defendants have manufac-\ntured an ambiguity so they can then unilaterally change \nthe law to suit their policy preferences. Id. at 8.  \niii. Auer Deference \nBecause Defendants assert their regulation is ambig-\nuous, the Court must determine whether their interpre-\ntation is entitled to deference. Defendants contend an \nagency may interpret its own regulation by issuing an \nopinion letter or other guidance which should be given \ncontrolling weight if: (1) the regulation is ambiguous; and \n(2) the interpretation is not plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation. Defs.’ Resp. 21, ECF No. 40; \nChristensen, 529 U.S. at 588 (“Auer deference is war-\nranted only when the language of the regulation is am-\nbiguous.”);  Auer  v.  Robbins,  519  U.S.  452,  461  (1997) \n(“[An agency’s] interpretation of [its regulation] is, under \nour jurisprudence, controlling unless ‘plainly erroneous \nor inconsistent with the regulation.’”) (quoting Robertson \nv. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989)).  \n\n220a \n \nThis deference is only warranted however when the \nlanguage of the regulation is ambiguous. Moore v. Han-\nnon  Food  Services,  Inc.,  317  F.3d  489,  495  (5th  Cir. \n2003).  Legislation  is  ambiguous  if  it  is  susceptible  to \nmore than one accepted meaning. Calix v. Lynch, 784 \nF.3d 1000, 1005 (5th Cir. 2015). “Multiple accepted mean-\nings do not exist merely because a statute’s ‘authors did \nnot  have  the  forethought  expressly  to  contradict  any \ncreative contortion that may later be constructed to ex-\npand or prune its scope.’ ” Id. (citing Moore, 317 F.3d at \n497  and  applying  this  rule  of  construction  to  regula-\ntions).  \nIf a regulation is not ambiguous, the agency’s inter-\npretation may be considered but only according to its \npersuasive power. Moore, 317 F.3d at 495. “Thus, a court \nmust determine whether ‘all but one of the meanings is \nordinarily  eliminated  by  context.’ ”  Calix,  784  F.3d  at \n1005 (quoting Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132–33 \n(1993)). When a term is not defined, courts may general-\nly give the words their common and ordinary meaning in \naccordance with legislative intent. D.C. Bd. of Elections \n& Ethics v. D.C., 866 A.2d 788, 798 n.18 (D.C. 2005) (“In \nfinding the ordinary meaning, ‘the use of dictionary defi-\nnitions is appropriate in interpreting undefined statutory \nterms.’”); 1618 Twenty–First St. Tenants Ass’n, Inc. v. \nPhillips Collection, 829 A.2d 201, 203 (D.C. 2003) (same). \nFurthermore,  “an  agency  is  not  entitled  to  deference \nwhen it offers up an interpretation of [a regulation] that \n[courts]  have  already  said  to  be  unambiguously  fore-\nclosed by the regulatory text.” Exelon Wind 1, L.L.C. v. \nNelson, 766 F.3d 380, 399 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Chris-\ntensen, 529 U.S. at 588).  \n\n221a \n \nBased  on  the  foregoing  authority,  the  Court  con-\ncludes § 106.33 is not ambiguous. It cannot be disputed \nthat the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106.33 \nwhen it was enacted by DOE following passage of Title \nIX meant the biological and anatomical differences be-\ntween male and female students as determined at their \nbirth. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.33; 45 Fed. Reg. 30955 (May 9, \n1980); Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.S. at 512 (holding \nthat intent determined at the time the regulations are \npromulgated).  It  appears  Defendants  at  least  tacitly \nagree this distinction was the intent of the drafter. See \nHolder  Memo  1,  ECF  No.  6-3  (“The  federal  govern-\nment’s  approach  to  this  issue  has  also  evolved  over \ntime.”); see also Hr’g Tr. 33 (“[I]t may very well be that \nCongress did not intend the law to protect transgender \nindividuals.”).  \nAdditionally, it cannot reasonably be disputed that \nDOE complied with Congressional intent when drawing \nthe distinctions in § 106.33 based on the biological differ-\nences between male and female students. Pls.’ Mot. In-\njunction  17–18,  ECF  No.  11  (citing  legislative  history \nand common understanding of its meaning at the time of \npassage). As the support identified by Plaintiffs shows, \nthis was the common understanding of the term when \nTitle IX was enacted, and remained the understanding \nduring the regulatory process that led to the promulga-\ntion of § 106.33. See Pls.’ Am. Compl. ¶¶ 8–13, ECF No. \n6; see also G.G., 822 F.3d at 736 (Niemeyer, J., dissent-\ning) (providing comprehensive list of various definitions \nfrom the 1970s which demonstrated “during that time \nperiod, virtually every dictionary definition of ‘sex’ re-\nferred to the physiological distinctions between males \nand females, particularly with respect to their reproduc-\n\n222a \n \ntive  functions.”).  This  undoubtedly  was  permitted  be-\ncause the areas identified by the regulations are places \nwhere  male  and  female  students  may  have  to  expose \ntheir “nude or partially nude body, genitalia, and other \nprivate parts,” and separation from members of the op-\nposite sex, those whose bodies possessed a different ana-\ntomical structure, was needed to ensure personal priva-\ncy. See G.G., 822 F.3d at 723.  \nThis  conclusion  is  also  supported  by  the  text  and \nstructure of the regulations. Section 106.33 specifically \npermits educational institutions to provide separate toi-\nlets, locker rooms, and showers based on sex, provided \nthat the separate facilities are comparable. The sections \nimmediately  preceding  and  following  § 106.33  likewise \npermit educational institutions to separate students on \nthe basis of sex. For instance, § 106.32 permits educa-\ntional institutions to provide separate housing for stu-\ndents on the basis of sex, again so long as the separate \nhousing  is  comparable,  and  § 106.33  permits  separate \neducational sessions for boys and girls when dealing with \ninstruction  concerning  human  sexuality.  34  C.F.R. \n§§ 106.32,  106.34.  Without  question,  permitting  educa-\ntional institutions to provide separate housing to male \nand female students, and separate educational instruc-\ntion  concerning  human  sexuality,  was  to  protect  stu-\ndents’ personal privacy, or discussion of their personal \nprivacy, while in the presence of members of the oppo-\nsite biological sex. G.G., 822 F.3d at 723. Accordingly, \nthis  interpretation  of  § 106.33  is  consistent  with  the \nstructure and purpose of the regulations.  \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes § 106.33 \nis not ambiguous. Given this regulation is not ambiguous, \nDefendants’ definition is not entitled to Auer deference, \n\n223a \n \nmeaning it does not receive controlling weight. Auer, 519 \nU.S. at 461. Instead, Defendants’ interpretation is enti-\ntled to respect, but only to the extent it has the power to \npersuade. Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587. In his dissent in \nG.G., Judge Niemeyer characterized Defendants’ defini-\ntion as “illogical and unworkable.” G.G., 822 F.3d at 737. \nHe outlined a number of scenarios, which need not be \nrepeated here, where the Defendants’ interpretation on-\nly causes more confusion for educational institutions. Id. \nA definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unper-\nsuasive. Additionally, since this definition alters the defi-\nnition the agency has used since its enactment, its per-\nsuasive effect is decreased. See Morton, 415 U.S. at 237; \nsee also Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 132 \nS.  Ct.  2156,  2168  (2012)  (holding  that  an  agency  an-\nnouncement  of  an  interpretation  preceded  by  a  very \nlengthy period with no interpretation indicates agency \nconsidered prior practice lawful). Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes  Defendants’  interpretation  is  insufficient  to \novercome  the  regulation’s  plain  language  and  for  the \nreasons stated above is contrary to law.  \n2.  Threat of Irreparable Harm \nThe Court next addresses irreparable harm. Defend-\nants allege that Plaintiffs have not identified any pending \nor imminent enforcement action, and the Guidelines “ex-\npose  [P]laintiffs  to  no  new  liability  or  legal  require-\nments.”  Defs.’  Resp.  7,  ECF  No.  40  (citing  Google  v. \nHood, 822 F.3d 212, 227 (5th Cir. 2016). Defendants ar-\ngue  that,  “[a]lthough  [P]laintiffs  do  identify  a  small \nnumber of specific ‘policies and practices’ that they claim \nare in conflict with [D]efendants’ interpretation of Title \nIX,  they  have  identified  no  enforcement  action  being \n\n224a \n \ntaken against them—now or in the future—as a result \nof these polices.” Defs.’ Resp. 8–9, ECF No. 40. They as-\nsert that even if DOE were “to decide to bring an admin-\nistrative enforcement action against plaintiffs for non-\ncompliance . . . at some point in the future, [P]laintiffs \nstill would be unable to make a showing of irreparable \nharm because they would have an opportunity to chal-\nlenge  the  interpretation  in  an  administrative  process \nprior to any loss of federal funds.” Id. at 9 (quoting Mor-\ngan v. Fletcher, 518 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1975)).  \nPlaintiffs counter that “Defendants’ actions cause ir-\nreparable  harm  by  forcing  policy  changes,  imposing \ndrastic financial consequences, and usurping [Plaintiffs’] \nlegitimate authority.” Mot. Injunction 21, ECF No. 11. \nAccording to Plaintiffs, Defendants’ actions present “a \nHobson’s choice between violating federal rules (labeled \nas regulations, guidance, and interpretations) on the one \nhand, and transgressing longstanding policies and prac-\ntices, on the other.” Id. Thus, Plaintiffs characterize De-\nfendants’  administrative  letters  and  notices  as  “man-\ndates” which effectively carry the force of law. Id. Plain-\ntiffs also allege that Defendants’ rules are “irreconcilable \nwith countless polices regarding restrooms, showers, and \nintimate  facilities,”  while  threatening  to  override  the \npractices  of  “countless  schools,”  which  had  previously \nbeen allowed to differentiate intimate facilities on the \nbasis of biological sex consistent with Title IX, federal \nregulations, and laws protecting privacy and dignity. Id. \n(citing Mot. Injunction, Ex. P. (Thweatt Dec.) 5–7, ECF \nNo. 11-2).  \nDefendants’ appear to concede the Guidelines conflict \nwith Plaintiffs’ policies and practices, see Defs.’ Resp. 8–\n9; ECF No. 40 (“[P]laintiffs do identify a small number \n\n225a \n \nof specific ‘policies and practices’ . . . .”); however, they \nargue  that  additional  threats  of  enforcement  are  re-\nquired before irreparable harm exists. Case law does not \nsupport  this  contention.  Instead  the  authorities  hold, \n“any time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuat-\ning statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it \nsuffers a form of irreparable injury.” See Coalition for \nEcon. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 718, 719 (9th Cir. 1997) \n(stating, whenever an enactment of a state’s people is \nenjoined,  the  state  suffers  irreparable  injury);  accord \nPlanned  Parenthood  of  Greater  Tex.  Surgical  Health \nServs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013) (“When \na statute is enjoined, the State necessarily suffers the \nirreparable harm of denying the public interest in the \nenforcement of its laws.”); Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. \n1, 3 (2012) (citing New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin \nW. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in \nchambers) (“[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court \nfrom effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of \nits people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”).  \nAs Defendants have conceded the conflict between \nthe Guidelines and Plaintiffs’ policies, and Plaintiffs have \nidentified a number of statutes that conflict, the Court \nconcludes  Plaintiffs  have  sufficiently  demonstrated  a \nthreat of irreparable harm.20 \n                                                   \n20 Defendants also contend the injunction should be denied because \nPlaintiffs delayed in seeking this relief. The DOJ/DOE Letter is \ndated May 13, 2016. This case was filed very soon after on May 25, \n2016, and the parties reached an agreement on a briefing schedule \nto consider this request. The Court concludes Plaintiffs did not fail \nto act timely.  \n\n226a \n \n3.  Balance of Hardships and Public Interest21 \nThe Court next considers whether the threatened in-\njury to the Plaintiffs outweighs whatever damage the \nproposed injunction may cause Defendants and its im-\npact  on  the  public  interest.  Nichols,  532  F.3d  at  372. \nPlaintiffs risk either running afoul of Defendants’ Guide-\nlines or complying and violating various state statutes \nand, in some cases, their state constitutions. Mot. Injunc-\ntion 21, ECF No. 11. Plaintiffs also state that they likely \nrisk legal action from parents, students, and other mem-\nbers of their respective communities should they actually \ncomply with Defendants’ Guidelines. Defendants argue \nthese harms do not outweigh the damage that granting \nthe injunction will cause because it will impede their abil-\nity to eliminate discrimination in the workplace and edu-\ncational settings, prevent them from definitively explain-\ning to the public the rights and obligations under these \nstatutes, and it would have a deleterious effect on the \ntransgendered.  \nThe Court concludes Plaintiffs have established that \nthe failure to grant an injunction will place them in the \nposition of either maintaining their current policies in \nthe face of the federal government’s view that they are \nviolating the law, or changing them to comply with the \nGuidelines and cede their authority over this issue. See \nDOJ/DOE Letter, ECF No. 6-10 (“This letter summa-\nrizes  a  school’s  Title  IX  obligations  regarding \ntransgender students and explains how [DOE and DOJ] \nevaluate a school’s compliance with these obligations.”). \n                                                   \n21 The Parties address the third and fourth Canal factors together, \ntherefore they are treated together in this Order as well. \n\n227a \n \nPlaintiffs’ harms in this regard outweigh those identified \nby  Defendants,  particularly  since  the  Supreme  Court \nstayed the Fourth Circuit’s decision supporting Defend-\nants’ position, and a decision from the Supreme Court in \nthe near future may obviate the issues in this lawsuit. As \na result, Plaintiffs interests outweigh those identified by \nDefendants. Further, Defendants have not offered evi-\ndence  that  Plaintiffs  are  not  accommodating  students \nwho  request  an  alternative  arrangement.  Indeed,  the \nschool district at issue in G.G. provided its student an \naccommodation.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met \ntheir burden and these factors weigh in favor of granting \nthe preliminary injunction.  \nC.  Scope of the Injunction \nFinally, the Court must determine the scope of the \ninjunction. Plaintiffs seek to apply the injunction nation-\nwide.  Mot.  Injunction  3,  ECF  No.  11;  Pls.’  Reply  13, \nECF  No.  52.  Defendants  counter  that  the  injunction \nshould be narrowly tailored to Plaintiffs in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit. Defs.’ Resp. 28, ECF No. 40. \n“Absent the clearest command to the contrary from \nCongress, federal courts retain their equitable power to \nissue injunctions in suits over which they have jurisdic-\ntion.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 705 (1979). \n“[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent \nof the violation established, not by the geographical ex-\ntent of the plaintiff class.” Id. at 702 (permitting a na-\ntionwide injunction because the class action was proper \nand finding that a nationwide injunction was not more \nburdensome than necessary to redress plaintiffs’ com-\nplaints). \n\n228a \n \nThe Court concludes this injunction should apply na-\ntionwide. As the separate facilities provision in § 106.33 \nis permissive, states that authorize schools to define sex \nto include gender identity for purposes of providing sep-\narate restroom, locker room, showers, and other intimate \nfacilities will not be impacted by it. Those states who do \nnot want to be covered by this injunction can easily avoid \ndoing so by state law that recognizes the permissive na-\nture § 106.33. It therefore only applies to those states \nwhose  laws  direct  separation.  However,  an  injunction \nshould  not  unnecessarily  interfere  with  litigation  cur-\nrently pending before other federal courts on this sub-\nject  regardless  of  the  state  law.  As  such,  the  parties \nshould file a pleading describing those cases so the Court \ncan appropriately narrow the scope if appropriate.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plain-\ntiffs’ application for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. \n11) should be and is hereby GRANTED. See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 65. It is FURTHER ORDERED that bond is set in \nthe amount of one hundred dollars.22 See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65(c). Defendants are enjoined from enforcing the Guide-\nlines  against  Plaintiffs  and  their  respective  schools, \nschool boards, and other public, educationally-based in-\nstitutions.  Further,  while  this  injunction  remains  in \nplace, Defendants are enjoined from initiating, continu-\ning, or concluding any investigation based on Defend-\nants’  interpretation  that  the  definition  of  sex  includes \ngender identity in Title IX’s prohibition against discrim-\n                                                   \n22 Neither party addressed the appropriate bond amount should an \ninjunction be entered. \n\n229a \n \nination on the basis of sex. Additionally, Defendants are \nenjoined  from  using  the  Guidelines  or  asserting  the \nGuidelines carry weight in any litigation initiated follow-\ning the date of this Order. All parties to this cause of ac-\ntion must maintain the status quo as of the date of issu-\nance of this Order and this preliminary injunction will \nremain in effect until the Court rules on the merits of \nthis claim, or until further direction from the Fifth Cir-\ncuit Court of Appeals. This preliminary injunction shall \nbe binding on Defendants and any officers, agents, serv-\nants, employees, attorneys, or other persons in active \nconcert or participation with Defendants, as provided in \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 65(d)(2). \nSO ORDERED on this 21st day of August, 2016.  \n \n /s/ Reed O’Connor  \nReed O’Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n ",

We join a growing consensus of courts in holding that the answer is resoundingly \nyes. \nNow a twenty-year-old college student, Plaintiff-Appellee Gavin Grimm has spent \nthe past five years litigating against the Gloucester County School Board’s refusal to allow \nhim as a transgender male to use the boys restrooms at Gloucester County High School.  \nGrimm’s birth-assigned sex, or so-called “biological sex,” is female, but his gender identity \nis male.  Beginning at the end of his freshman year, Grimm changed his first name to Gavin \nand expressed his male identity in all aspects of his life.  After conversations with a school \ncounselor and the high school principal, Gavin entered his sophomore year living fully as \na boy.  At first, the school allowed him to use the boys bathrooms.  But once word got out, \nthe Gloucester County School Board (the “Board”) faced intense backlash from parents, \nand ultimately adopted a policy under which students could only use restrooms matching \ntheir “biological gender.”   \nThe Board built single-stall restrooms as an “alternative” for students with “gender \nidentity issues.”  Grimm suffered from stigma, from urinary tract infections from bathroom \navoidance,  and  from  suicidal  thoughts  that  led  to  hospitalization.    Nevertheless,  he \npersevered  in  his  transition;  he  underwent  chest  reconstruction  surgery,  received  a \nstate-court order stating that he is male, and amended his birth certificate to accurately \n5 \n \n\nreflect his gender.  But when he provided the school with his new documentation, the Board \nrefused to amend his school records.   \nGrimm first sued in 2015, alleging that, as applied to exclude him from the boys \nbathrooms, the Board’s policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and constituted discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Since then, Grimm amended \nhis complaint to add that the Board’s refusal to amend his school records similarly violates \nboth equal protection and Title IX.  In 2019, after five winding years of litigation, the \ndistrict court finally granted Grimm summary judgment on both claims.  It awarded Grimm \nnominal damages, declaratory relief, attorney’s fees, and injunctive relief from the Board’s \nrefusal to correct his school records.  The Board timely appealed.  Agreeing with the district \ncourt’s considered opinion, we affirm. \n \nI.  Background \nA. \n  To be sure, many of us carry heavy baggage into any discussion of gender and sex.  \nWith the help of our amici and Grimm’s expert, we start by unloading that baggage and \ndeveloping a fact-based understanding of what it means to be transgender, along with the \nimplications of gendered-bathroom usage for transgender students.  \nGiven a binary option between “Women” and “Men,” most people do not have to \nthink twice about which bathroom to use.  That is because most people are cisgender, \nmeaning that their gender identity—or their “deeply felt, inherent sense” of their gender—\n6 \n \n\naligns with their sex-assigned-at-birth.  See Br. of Amici Curiae Med., Pub. Health, & \nMental Health Orgs. in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 4–5 (hereinafter “Br. of Medical Amici”) \n(primarily relying on Am. Psychol. Ass’n, Guidelines for Psychological Practice with \nTransgender and Gender Nonconforming People, 70 Am. Psychologist 832 (2015)).1  But \nthere have always been people who “consistently, persistently, and insistently” express a \ngender that, on a binary, we would think of as opposite to their assigned sex.  See id. at 8; \nsee also J.A. 174–75 (Dr. Penn Expert Report & Decl. at 3–4). \nSuch people are transgender, and they represent approximately 0.6% of the United \nStates adult population, or 1.4 million adults.  See Br. of Medical Amici 5.  Just like being \ncisgender, being transgender is natural and is not a choice.  See id. at 7.   \nBeing transgender is also not a psychiatric condition, and “implies no impairment \nin judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.”  See id. at 6 \n(quoting  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Position  Statement  on  Discrimination  Against \nTransgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)); see also Br. of Amicus Curiae the \nTrevor Project in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 4 (hereinafter “Br. of Trevor Project”) (explaining \nthat the World Health Organization also declassified being transgender as a mental illness).  \n \n1 Amici curiae party to this brief include the following seventeen leading medical, \npublic  health,  and  mental  health  organizations:  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics, \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of PAs, \nAmerican  College  of  Physicians,  American  Medical  Association,  American  Medical \nStudents  Association,  American  Medical  Women’s  Association,  American  Nurses \nAssociation,  American  Psychiatric  Association,  American  Public  Health  Association, \nAssociation of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs, GLMA: Health Professionals \nAdvancing LGBTQ Equality, LBGT PA Caucus, Pediatric Endocrine Society, Society for \nAdolescent Health and Medicine, Society for Physician Assistants in Pediatrics, and World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health. \n7 \n \n\nHowever, transgender people face major mental health disparities: they are up to three \ntimes more likely to report or be diagnosed with a mental health disorder as the general \npopulation, Am. Med. Ass’n & GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality, \nIssue Brief: Transgender Individuals’ Access to Public Facilities 2 (2018), and nearly nine \ntimes more likely to attempt suicide than the general population, see Sandy E. James et al., \nNat’l Ctr. for Transgender Equal., The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey 114 \n(Dec. 2016) (hereinafter “USTS Report”). \nMoreover, many transgender people are clinically diagnosed with gender dysphoria, \n“a condition that is characterized by debilitating distress and anxiety resulting from the \nincongruence between an individual’s gender identity and birth-assigned sex.”  Br. of \nMedical Amici 9; see also Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 768–69 (9th Cir. 2019).  \nGender dysphoria is defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders.  “[T]o be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the \nincongruence [between gender identity and assigned sex] must have persisted for at least \nsix months and be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, \noccupational, or other important areas of functioning.”  See J.A. 175 (Dr. Penn Expert \nReport & Decl. at 4); see also Br. of Medical Amici 9 (citing Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451–53 (5th ed. 2013) (hereinafter \n“DSM-5”)).  Incongruence between gender identity and assigned sex must be manifested \nby at least two of the following markers: \n(1) “[a] marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender \nand primary and/or secondary sex characteristics”; \n \n8 \n \n\n(2) “[a]  strong  desire  to  be  rid  of  one’s  primary  and/or  secondary  sex \ncharacteristics  because  of  a  marked  incongruence  with  one’s \nexperienced/expressed gender”; \n \n(3) “[a] strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of \nthe other gender”; \n \n(4) “[a] strong desire to be of the other gender”; \n \n(5) “[a] strong desire to be treated as the other gender”; or \n \n(6) “[a] strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of \nthe other gender.” \n \nSee DSM-5 at 452 (J.A. 1117).   \nPuberty  is  a  particularly  difficult  time  for  transgender  children,  who  “often \nexperience intensified gender dysphoria and worsening mental health” as their bodies \ndiverge further from their gender identity.  Br. of Medical Amici 10.  Left untreated, gender \ndysphoria can cause, among other things, depression, substance use, self-mutilation, other \nself-harm,  and  suicide.    Id.  at  11.    Being  subjected  to  prejudice  and  discrimination \nexacerbates these negative health outcomes.  Id. at 11. \n  For  many  years,  mental  health  practitioners  attempted  to  convert  transgender \npeople’s gender identity to conform with their sex assigned at birth, which did not alleviate \ndysphoria, but rather caused shame and psychological pain.  Id. at 11–12.  Fortunately, we \nnow have modern accepted treatment protocols for gender dysphoria.  Developed by the \nWorld Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the Standards of Care \nfor the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (7th \nVersion  2012)  (hereinafter  “WPATH  Standards  of  Care”)  represent  the  consensus \napproach of the medical and mental health community, Br. of Medical Amici 13, and have \n9 \n \n\nbeen recognized by various courts, including this one, as the authoritative standards of care, \nsee De’lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d 520, 522–23 (4th Cir. 2013); see also Edmo, 935 F.3d \nat 769; Keohane v. Jones, 328 F. Supp. 3d 1288, 1294 (N.D. Fla. 2018), vacated sub nom. \nKeohane v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr. Sec’y, 952 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2020).2  “There are no other \ncompeting, evidence-based standards that are accepted by any nationally or internationally \nrecognized medical professional groups.”  Edmo, 935 F.3d at 769 (quoting Edmo v. Idaho \nDep’t of Corr., 358 F. Supp. 3d 1103, 1125 (D. Idaho 2018)).3 \n \n2  To  be  sure,  some  courts  have  held  in  the  Eighth  Amendment  deliberate-\nindifference context that there remains medical disagreement as to the necessity of sex \nreassignment surgery (SRS), which the WPATH Standards of Care include as a treatment \nnecessary for some patients.  See Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 219–20 (5th Cir. 2019); \nKosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 90 (1st Cir. 2014) (discussing one expert’s dismissal of \nthe WPATH Standards of Care as they pertain to SRS, and later holding that prison officials \nwere not deliberately indifferent when presented with “two alternative treatment plans” by \n“competent professionals”).  But see Flack v. Wis. Dep’t of Health Servs., 395 F. Supp. 3d \n1001, 1017 (W.D. Wis. 2019) (explaining that the record in Kosilek was developed in 2006, \n“at which time medical experts disagreed” as to the necessity of SRS for Kosilek, and that \nthe Fifth Circuit in Gibson was not presented with new record evidence, but rather relied \non the same 2006 evidentiary record in Kosilek).  We need not offer an opinion one way \nor the other. \n \n3 That did not prevent the Board from finding an expert, Dr. Quentin Van Meter, \nwho disagrees with the WPATH Standards of Care, and who treats transgender youth by \nencouraging them to live in accordance with their sex assigned at birth.  It goes without \nsaying  that  one  can  always  find  a  doctor  who  disagrees  with  mainstream  medical \nprofessional organizations  on  a  particular  issue.   Aspects  of  Dr.  Van  Meter’s  report \nblatantly contradict the views of Grimm’s expert, as well as the American Academy of \nPediatrics and our other medical amici.  On appeal, however, the Board relies on Dr. Van \nMeter’s testimony only for its assertion that Grimm remained biologically female.  See \nOpening Br. 12, 27, 46.  The Board does not assert that Dr. Van Meter’s report creates any \ngenuine factual questions that would impact our legal analysis below.  Therefore, we need \nnot consider the remainder of his assertions, and may rely on the overwhelming evidence \nregarding the accepted standards of care. \n10 \n \n\n  The WPATH Standards of Care outline appropriate treatments for persons with \ngender dysphoria, including “[c]hanges in gender expression and role (which may involve \nliving part time or full time in another gender role, consistent with one’s gender identity),” \nhormone treatment therapy, sex reassignment surgery, “[s]urgery to change primary and/or \nsecondary sex characteristics,” and psychotherapy “for purposes such as exploring gender \nidentity, role, and expression; addressing the negative impact of gender dysphoria and \nstigma on mental health; alleviating internalized transphobia; enhancing social and peer \nsupport; improving body image; or promoting resilience.”  See J.A. 200–01 (WPATH \nStandards of Care 9–10).  “The number and type of interventions applied and the order in \nwhich these take place may differ from person to person,” J.A. 200 (WPATH Standards of \nCare 9), and special considerations are taken before adolescents are provided with physical \ntransition treatments such as hormone therapy, J.A. 209–212 (WPATH Standards of Care \n18–21). \n    There  is  no  question  that  there  are  students  in  our  K-12  schools  who  are \ntransgender.  For many of us, gender identity is established between the ages of three and \nfour years old.  Br. of Medical Amici 7.  Thus, some transgender students enter the K-12 \nschool system as their gender; others, like Grimm, begin to live their gender when they are \nolder.  By the time youth are teenagers, approximately 0.7% identify as transgender.  That \nmeans that there are about 150,000 transgender teens in the United States.  That is not to \nsuggest that people are either cisgender or transgender, and that everyone identifies as a \nbinary gender of male or female.  Of course, there are other gender-expansive youth who \nmay identify as nonbinary, youth born intersex who do or do not identify with their sex-\n11 \n \n\nassigned-at-birth, and others whose identities belie gender norms.  See generally PFLAG, \nPFLAG National Glossary of Terms (July 2019), http://pflag.org/glossary (explaining that \n“transgender” is “also used as an umbrella term to describe groups of people who transcend \nconventional expectations of gender identity or expression”).  But today’s question is \nlimited to how school bathroom policies implicate the rights of transgender students who \n“consistently, persistently, and insistently” express a binary gender. \nTransgender students face unique challenges in the school setting.  In the largest \nnationwide  study  of  transgender  discrimination,  the  2015  U.S.  Transgender  Survey \n(USTS), 77% of respondents who were known or perceived as transgender in their K-12 \nschools reported harassment by students, teachers, or staff.  Br. of Amici Curiae Sch. \nAdm’rs from Twenty-Nine States & D.C. in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 6 (hereinafter “Br. of \nSchool Administrator Amici”) (citing USTS Report at 132–35).  For such students who \nwere known or perceived to be transgender:  \n-  54% reported verbal harassment; \n-  52% reported that they were not allowed to dress in a way expressing their \ngender; \n \n-  24%  reported  being  physically  attacked  because  people  thought  they  were \ntransgender; \n \n-  20% believed they were disciplined more harshly because teachers or staff \nthought they were transgender; \n \n-  13%  reported  being  sexually  assaulted  because  people  thought  they  were \ntransgender; and \n \n-  17% reported having left a school due to severe mistreatment. \n12 \n \n\nUSTS Report at 11.  Unsurprisingly, then, harassment of transgender students is also \ncorrelated  with  academic  success:  students  who  experienced  greater  harassment  had \nsignificantly lower grade point averages.  Br. of School Administrator Amici 11.  And \nharassment at school is similarly correlated with mental health outcomes for transgender \nstudents.  The opposite is also true, though: transgender students have better mental health \noutcomes when their gender identity is affirmed.  See Br. of Trevor Project 8. \nUsing  the  school  restrooms  matching  their  gender  identity  is  one  way  that \ntransgender students can affirm their gender and socially transition, but restroom policies \nvary.  In one survey, 58% of transgender youth reported being discouraged from using the \nbathroom that corresponds with their gender.  See id.  When being forced to use a special \nrestroom or one that does not align with their gender, more than 40% of transgender \nstudents fast, dehydrate, or find ways not to use the restroom.  Br. of Amici Curiae the \nNat’l PTA, GLSEN, Am. Sch. Counselor Ass’n, and Nat’l Assoc. of Sch.

Such restroom avoidance frequently leads to medical problems.  See id. at 16 \n(citing Jody L. Herman, Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation \nof Gender and its Impact on Transgender People’s Lives, 19 J. Pub. Mgmt. & Soc. Pol’y \n65, 74–75 (2013)).  To respond to the needs of transgender students, school districts across \nthe country have implemented policies that allow transgender students to use the restroom \nmatching their gender identity, and they have done so without incident.

Bds. as Amici Curiae in Support of Appellee and in Favor of \nAffirmance (hereinafter “Br. of Virginia School Board Amici”).   \n \nB. \n  With that essential grounding, we turn to the facts of this case.  In so doing, we \nrecount the district court’s factual findings, adding only undisputed facts from the record \nwhen helpful to our analysis. \nWhen Gavin Grimm was born, he was identified as female, and his sex so indicated \non his birth certificate.  But Grimm always knew that he was a boy.  For example, when \ngiven the choice, he would opt to wear boys’ clothing.  He recounts how uncomfortable he \nwas when made to wear a dress to a sibling’s wedding.  Grimm also related to male \ncharacters, and he felt joy whenever he was “mis”-identified as a male—whether by an \nadult lining children up in “boy-girl” fashion, or by a good friend who recognized that \nGrimm was male.  At the time, though, Grimm did not have the language to describe \nhimself as transgender.   \nIn September 2013, Grimm began attending Gloucester High School, a public high \nschool in Gloucester County, Virginia.  He was enrolled as a female.    \nIn April 2014, during Grimm’s freshman year, he disclosed to his mother that he \nwas transgender.  At Grimm’s request, he began therapy the following month with Dr. Lisa \nGriffin, Ph.D., a psychologist with experience counseling transgender youth.  Dr. Griffin \ndiagnosed  Grimm  with  gender  dysphoria.    Dr.  Griffin  then  prepared  a  treatment \n14 \n \n\ndocumentation letter stating that Grimm had gender dysphoria, that he should present as a \nmale in his daily life, that he should be considered and treated as a male, and that he should \nbe allowed to use restrooms consistent with that identity.  Dr. Griffin also referred Grimm \nto an endocrinologist for hormone treatment.  \nBy the end of his freshman year, Grimm was out to his whole family, had changed \nhis first name to Gavin, and was expressing his male identity in all aspects of his life.  He \nused male pronouns to describe himself.  He even used men’s restrooms when in public, \nwith no incidents or questions asked.   \nIn August 2014, before the beginning of Grimm’s sophomore year, Grimm and his \nmother met with a school guidance counselor, Tiffany Durr, to discuss his transition.  They \ngave Durr a copy of  Dr. Griffin’s treatment documentation letter and requested that \nGrimm be treated as a boy at school.  At the time, the student bathrooms were all multi-\nstalled and single-sex—i.e., boys and girls bathrooms.  Those bathrooms were located \nthroughout the school.  The only other options were apparently a restroom located in the \nnurse’s office, and the faculty restrooms.  Grimm agreed to use the restroom in the nurse’s \noffice.  But once school started, he “soon found it stigmatizing to use a separate restroom” \nand “began to feel anxiety and shame surrounding [his] travel to the nurse’s office.”  J.A. \n113 (Gavin Grimm Decl. at ¶ 29).  He also realized that using the restroom in the nurse’s \noffice caused him to be late to class because of its location in the school. \nAfter a few weeks of using the nurse’s office, Grimm met with Durr again and asked \nfor permission to use the boys restrooms.  Durr asked the high school principal, Principal \nCollins, who spoke with the Superintendent, Dr. Clemons.  The Superintendent deferred to \n15 \n \n\nPrincipal  Collins’s  judgment,  and  Principal  Collins  allowed  Grimm to  use  the  male \nrestrooms.  At that time, the Board was not yet involved.  Grimm was given permission to \ncomplete his physical education courses online and never needed to use the locker rooms \nat school.  \nFor seven  weeks,  Grimm used  the  boys  restrooms  at  Gloucester  County  High \nSchool without incident.  Despite that smooth transition, adults in the community caught \nwind of the arrangement and began to complain.  Superintendent Clemons, Principal \nCollins, and Board members began receiving numerous complaints via email and phone \nnot  only  from  adults  within  that  school  district  but  also  from  adults  in  neighboring \ncommunities and even other states.  Only one student personally complained to Principal \nCollins, and that student did so before the restroom privacy improvements discussed below.   \nFollowing these complaints, Board member Carla Hook, who had expressed her \nopposition to having a transgender male in the boys bathrooms, proposed the following \npolicy at the Board’s public meeting on November 11, 2014: \nWhereas the [Gloucester County Public Schools (GCPS)] recognizes that \nsome students question their gender identities, and \n \nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and \nguidance from parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and \n \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all \nstudents and to protect the privacy of all students, therefore \n \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and \nlocker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be \nlimited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender \nidentity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility. \n \n16 \n \n\nJ.A. 775.  Neither the Board nor the school informed either Grimm or his family that \nGrimm’s bathroom usage would be up for debate at that Board meeting.  Rather, news of \nthe topic for the meeting spread on Facebook, and Grimm’s mother found out from a friend \nthe day before.  Grimm and his parents attended the meeting, at which twenty-four other \ncommunity members spoke.    \nAlthough some community members supported creating a separate restroom for \nGrimm, by and large, they vehemently opposed allowing Grimm to use the boys restrooms.  \nTwo common themes arose: (1) that the “majority” must be protected from such minority \nintrusion, see, e.g., School Board Meeting, Gloucester County School Board (Nov. 11, \n2014), at 14:48–15:20 (hereinafter, “November Meeting”), http://gloucester.granicus.com/ \nplayer/clip/1065?view_id=10 (“It is a disruption. . . . [W]e have more to consider than just \nthe rights of one student. . . . what about the rights of other students, the majority of the \nstudents at Gloucester High School.”), cited by Opening Br. 11 n.2; id. at 18:57–19:06 \n(“While we have an obligation to provide minority rights, we still are a majority rule \ncountry . . . .”), and (2) that allowing transgender students to use the bathroom matching \ntheir gender identity would open the door to predatory behavior, particularly by male \nstudents pretending to be transgender in order to use the girls bathroom, see, e.g., id. at \n14:27–14:39 (“When we have a situation with a young man that says they want to identify \nthemselves as a young lady and they go in . . . the ladies’ room with ill intent, where does \nit end?”); id. at 20:57–21:02 (“A young man can come up and say, ‘I’m a girl, I need to use \nthe ladies’ rooms now.’ And they’d be lying through their teeth.”).   \n17 \n \n\nThe Board was set to vote on the proposed policy at that very meeting but voted 4-\n3 to delay the vote.  Come the next meeting, held on December 9, 2014, the comment \nperiod was even uglier.  One person called Grimm a “freak” and likened him to a dog, \nasking: “must we use tax dollars to install fire hydrants where you can publicly relieve \nyourselves?”  School Board Meeting, Gloucester County School Board (Dec. 9, 2014), at \n1:22:54–1:23:34, http://gloucester.granicus.com/ player/clip/1090?view_id=10, cited by \nOpening Br. 11 n.3.  Another likened Grimm to a “European” asking for a “bidet.”  Id. at \n1:40:45–1:40:48.  More than one person talked about Grimm’s gender identity as a choice.  \nSee id. at 1:13:58–1:14:09 (“Is it morally right for us to kneel or bow to the very few who \ndemand that they receive a special identification to meet needs of their own perceived body \nfunctions?”); id. at 1:18:48–1:19:49 (woman discussing her “former” lesbianism as an \n“addiction” from which “Jesus Christ set [her] free”).  And more than one citizen stated \nthat they would vote out the Board members if they allowed Grimm to use the boys \nrestroom.  See id. at 42:21–42:32, 50:53–50:56, 1:18:00–1:18:05. \nAt both meetings, Grimm and his parents spoke out against the proposed policy.  \nGrimm explained in part how “alienating” and “humiliating” it had been to use the nurse’s \noffice, and that it “took a lot of time away from [his] education.”  November Meeting at \n24:36–24:58.  He also explained that he was currently using the men’s public restrooms in \nGloucester County without “any sort of confrontation of any kind.”  Id. at 25:05–25:26. \nThe Board passed the proposed policy on December 9, 2014 by a 6-1 vote.  The \nfollowing day, Principal Collins sent a letter to Grimm explaining that he was no longer \n18 \n \n\nallowed to use the boys bathrooms, effective immediately, and that his further use of those \nbathrooms would result in disciplinary consequences.  \nAs a corollary to the policy, the Board approved a series of updates to the school’s \nrestrooms to improve general privacy for all students.  The updates included the addition \nor expansion of partitions between urinals in male restrooms, the addition of privacy strips \nto the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and the construction of three single-stall unisex \nrestrooms available to all students.   \n  At the same time that the bathroom policy was going into place in December 2014, \nGrimm began hormone therapy.  Hormone therapy “deepened [his] voice, increased [his] \ngrowth of facial hair, and [gave him] a more masculine appearance.”  J.A. 120 (Gavin \nGrimm Decl. ¶ 60).  But until the single-stall bathrooms were completed, Grimm’s only \noption was to use the girls bathrooms or the restroom in the nurse’s office.  Grimm recalls \nan incident when he stayed after school for an event, realized the nurse’s office was locked, \nand broke down in tears because there was no restroom he could use comfortably.  A \nlibrarian witnessed this and drove him home.  In a similar vein, and even after the single-\nuser restrooms had been built, Grimm could not use those restrooms when at football \ngames.  He recounts a friend having to drive him to a hardware store to use the restroom; \non another occasion, his mother had to come pick him up early. \nThe single-stall restrooms were completed on December 16, 2014, one week after \nthe Board enacted the policy.  Once completed, however, they were located far from classes \nthat Grimm attended.  A map of the school confirms that no single-user restrooms were \nlocated in Hall D, where Grimm attended most classes.   \n19 \n \n\nMoreover,  the  single-stall  restrooms  made  Grimm  feel  “stigmatized  and \nisolated.”  J.A. 117 (Gavin Grimm Decl. ¶ 47).  He never saw any other student use these \nrestrooms.  J.A. 117 (Gavin Grimm Decl. ¶ 48).  Principal Collins testified at his deposition \nthat he never saw a student use the single-user restrooms, but that he assumed that they \nwere used because they were cleaned daily.  \nAs commonly occurs for transgender students prohibited from using the restroom \nmatching their gender identity, see supra Part I.A, Grimm practiced restroom avoidance.  \nThis caused Grimm to suffer from recurring urinary tract infections, for which his mother \nkept medication “always stocked at home.”  J.A. 133 (Deirdre Grimm Decl. ¶ 26). \nDuring his junior year, Grimm was hospitalized for suicidal ideation resulting from \nbeing in an environment where he felt “unsafe, anxious, and disrespected.”  J.A. 119 (Gavin \nGrimm Decl. ¶ 54).  In a moment of affirmation, the hospital admitted him to the boys \nward.  The situation at Gloucester County High School had proved untenable for him, and \nhe sought other schooling options.  Grimm spent his junior year in a Gloucester County \nHigh School program in a separate building.  But that program was cancelled, and he had \nto return to the same restroom situation for his senior year.  Having collected credits in the \nprior program, he spent as little time at the high school as possible during his senior year. \nAt the same time, Grimm’s gender transition progressed.  In June 2015, before his \njunior year, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued Grimm state identification \nreflecting that he was male.  In June 2016, Grimm underwent chest reconstruction surgery \n20 \n \n\n(a double mastectomy).4  The Gloucester County Circuit Court found this to be a type of \n“gender reassignment surgery,” and on September 9, 2016, it issued an order declaring that \nGrimm is “now functioning fully as a male” and directing the Virginia Department of \nHealth to issue him a birth certificate accordingly.  Grimm’s new birth certificate was \nissued on October 27, 2016.   \nShortly thereafter, Grimm and his mother provided Gloucester County High School \nwith his new birth certificate and asked that his school records be updated to reflect his \ngender as male.  The decision of whether to amend Grimm’s records accordingly, though, \nlay with the Board.  In January 2017, through legal counsel, the Board informed Grimm in \na letter that it declined to update his records.  The Board did not provide a reason, but did \ninform Grimm of his right to a hearing, which Grimm did not request.  \nAs part of this litigation, the Board’s 30(b)(6) witness, Troy Andersen, testified that \nthe Board refused to update Grimm’s records because, in its view, Grimm’s amended birth \ncertificate was not issued in accordance with Virginia law and because it was marked \n“void.”  Grimm submitted a declaration from State Registrar and Director of the Division \nof Vital Records Janet Rainey, who administers Virginia’s vital records.  Rainey affirmed \nthe validity of Grimm’s birth certificate, stating: “On October 27, 2016, I issued a birth \ncertificate to Gavin Elliot Grimm.  The birth certificate states his sex as male.”  J.A. 982 \n(Decl. of Janet M. Rainey). \n \n4 The parties agree that Grimm could not have undergone gender confirmation \nsurgery of the genitalia until he was at least eighteen years old. \n21 \n \n\nGrimm graduated  high  school  on  June  10,  2017.   He  now  attends  community \ncollege in California and intends to transfer to a four-year university.  To do so, he will \nneed to provide his high school transcript, which still identifies him as female.   \n \nII.  Procedural History \nThe procedural history of this case is winding and has outlasted Grimm’s high \nschool career, shaping both the claims and relief sought.  Grimm first sued the Board on \nJune 11, 2015, at the end of his sophomore year.  Grimm alleged that the Board’s restroom \npolicy  impermissibly  discriminated  against  him  in  violation  of  both  Title  IX  of  the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution.    As  relief,  he  sought \ncompensatory  damages  and  an  injunction  allowing  him  to  use  the  boys  restrooms.  \nAlthough the Board’s policy similarly applies to locker room facilities, Grimm did not need \nto use the locker rooms and never challenged that aspect of the policy.  Because he only \nchallenges his exclusion from the boys restrooms, we refer to the policy as the “bathroom” \nor “restroom” policy throughout. \nThe Board filed a motion to dismiss Grimm’s claims.  In the first ruling in Grimm’s \ncase, the district court denied Grimm’s motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed \nhis Title IX claim, holding that it would not defer to a Guidance Document issued by the \nDepartment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which, at that time, directed in \npart that “[u]nder Title IX, a recipient must generally treat transgender students consistent \nwith their gender identity . . . .”  See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 132 \n22 \n \n\nF. Supp. 3d 736, 746 (E.D. Va. 2015).  The district court held that an implementing \nregulation of Title IX, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, “clearly allows the School Board to limit \nbathroom access ‘on the basis of sex,’ including birth of biological sex.”  Id. \nGrimm filed an interlocutory appeal, and this Court reversed, holding that the \nGuidance Document was entitled to deference.  See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. \nSch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 715 (4th Cir. 2016).  However, after that decision, the Department \nof Education and Department of Justice withdrew its prior Guidance Document, issuing a \nnew one.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court, which had granted the Board’s petition for writ \nof certiorari and had scheduled oral arguments, summarily vacated this Court’s decision \nand remanded for reconsideration in light of the shift in agency perspective.  See Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm, 137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017).   \nHaving graduated from high school, Grimm then filed an amended complaint, which \nwas assigned to a different district court judge.  The amended complaint did not seek \ncompensatory damages—only nominal damages and declaratory relief.5  It also adjusted \nGrimm’s Title IX claim in time to extend throughout his time at Gloucester County High \nSchool.  Finally, it incorporated more recent factual developments, including that Grimm \nunderwent chest reconstruction surgery, had his sex legally changed under Virginia law by \nthe  Gloucester  County  Circuit  Court,  and  received  a  new  birth  certificate  from  the \nDepartment of Health, listing his sex as male.  The Board once again filed a motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim.  In an opinion that would build the basis for summary \n \n5  Initially,  the  amended  complaint  retained  Grimm’s  request  for  a  permanent \ninjunction, but Grimm voluntarily dismissed that request. \n23 \n \n\njudgment, the district court denied the Board’s motion to dismiss.  As to Grimm’s Title IX \nclaim, the district court held that “claims of discrimination on the basis of transgender \nstatus are per se actionable under a gender stereotyping theory,” and that Grimm had \nsufficiently pleaded sex discrimination that harmed him.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. \nSch. Bd., 302 F. Supp. 3d 730, 746–47 (E.D. Va. 2018) (quoting M.A.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of \nTalbot Cty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704, 715 (D. Md. 2018)).  As to his equal protection claim, \nthe  district  court  held  that  heightened  scrutiny  applied  both  because  “transgender \nindividuals constitute at least a quasi-suspect class,” and because Grimm pleaded a sex-\nstereotyping claim.  Id. at 749–50.  And the policy could not withstand heightened scrutiny, \nthe district court reasoned, because it was not substantially related to the government’s \ninterest in protecting the privacy of other students.  See id. at 751 (explaining that Grimm \nused the boys bathroom without incident until adults complained, that transgender students \nare not more likely than others to peep, and that pre-pubescent and post-pubescent children \nshare bathrooms without issue).  Students enjoyed the added privacy of partitions installed \nin the boys bathroom, and if any students felt that the partitions were insufficient, they \ncould use the single-stalled bathrooms.  See id.  But to tell Grimm alone that he could not \nuse the multi-stalled boys bathrooms “singled out and stigmatized” him.  Id. \nAfter this win, Grimm filed a second amended complaint, adding a claim that the \nBoard’s refusal to update his gender on his school transcripts violates Title IX and equal \nprotection.  Grimm and the School Board then filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  \nAgain, the district court ruled in Grimm’s favor, granting him summary judgment on both \nhis Title IX and equal protection claims.   \n24 \n \n\nGrimm filed various exhibits in support of his motion, including medical treatment \nrecords and letters documenting his treatment.  The district court rejected the Board’s \nMotion to Strike these exhibits, holding that the authoring doctors were not being treated \nas expert witnesses, and that they were business records falling within a hearsay exception.  \nThe district court did grant the Board’s Motion to Strike as to one piece of evidence, \nhowever.  In February 2019, the Board had considered a new policy “that would allow \ntransgender students to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity if certain criteria \nwere met.”  Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 400 F. Supp. 3d 444, 455–56 (E.D. Va. \n2019).  The district court found that this policy was inadmissible because it was considered \nas a part of settlement negotiations.  Id.   \nOn the merits, and applying its prior Title IX holding as further supported by \nadditional intervening caselaw, the district court granted Grimm’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment on the Title IX claim.  In doing so, it rejected the Board’s contention that Grimm \nfailed  to  prove  harm,  see  infra  Section  V,  because  Grimm’s  declaration  under  oath \nexplained that going to the bathroom was like a “walk of shame,” and because he suffered \nurinary tract infections from trying to avoid the bathroom and was even hospitalized for \nsuicidal thoughts.  See id. at 458.  This was enough to prove that he was harmed; he did \nnot need expert testimony.  See id.   \nThe district court also granted Grimm’s Motion for Summary Judgment on his equal \nprotection claim, again finding more intervening support for its prior holding.  The Board \nhad presented a witness by deposition, Troy Andersen, who testified that using the toilet \nor  urinal  implicates  students’  privacy  concerns.    However,  “[w]hen  asked  why  the \n25 \n \n\nexpanded stalls and urinal dividers could not fully address those situations, Mr. Andersen \nresponded that he ‘was sure’ the policy also protected privacy interests in other ways, but \nthat he “[couldn’t] think of any other off the top of [his] head.’”  See id. at 461 (alterations \nin original).  Therefore, the district court found that the Board’s privacy argument was \n“based upon sheer conjecture and abstraction.’”  See id. (quoting Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker \nv. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1052 (7th Cir. 2017)).  \nRegarding Grimm’s school records, the Board had argued that Grimm’s amended \nbirth certificate did not comply with Virginia law.  But according to the district court, any \nquestion of compliance was “dispelled by the Declaration of Janet M. Rainey,” the State \nRegistrar and Director of the Division of Vital Records, who issued Grimm’s amended \nbirth certificate.  See id. at 458.  The court went on to declare that the Board’s “continued \nrecalcitrance” to fix his school records violated both Title IX and equal protection, and it \nissued a permanent injunction ordering the Board to correct Grimm’s school records.  Id.   \n  In addition to declaratory relief, the district court awarded nominal damages to \nGrimm in the amount of one dollar for the Board’s Title IX and equal protection violations, \nas well as attorney’s fees.  The Board timely appealed.  \n \n \nIII.  The Board’s Threshold Challenges to Grimm’s Claims \n  At the outset, we reject the Board’s two threshold challenges to Grimm’s claims on \nappeal: (1) that his claims pertaining to the restroom policy are moot, and (2) that his claims \npertaining to his school records must be administratively exhausted. \n \n26 \n \n\nA.  Mootness of Challenge to Restroom Policy \n \nFirst, the Board contends that we lack jurisdiction over Grimm’s challenges to the \nrestroom policy because those claims are mooted by his own amendments to the complaint, \nwhich  removed  his  request  for  injunctive  relief  and  compensatory  damages.    As \ncharacterized by the Board, by only seeking nominal damages and declaratory relief as to \nthe restroom policy, “Grimm seeks nothing more than a judicial stamp of approval, which \nis not a proper remedy.”  Reply Br. 1.  Finding a live controversy, we reject this argument. \nOur jurisdiction is restricted by Article III of the Constitution to “Cases” and \n“Controversies.”  See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 171 (2013).  A case becomes moot \nand jurisdiction is lost if, at any time during federal judicial proceedings, “the issues \npresented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the \noutcome.’”  See id. at 172 (quoting Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013)).  \nBut the bar for maintaining a legally cognizable claim is not high: “As long as the parties \nhave a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the case is not \nmoot.”  See id. (quoting Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 \n(2012)).  Naturally, then, plausible claims for damages defeat mootness challenges.  See \nMission Prod. Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019) (“If there is any \nchance of money changing hands, [the] suit remains live.”); see also 13C Charles Alan \nWright  et  al.,  Federal  Practice  and  Procedure  § 3533.3  (3d  ed.  April  2020  Update) \n(hereinafter “Wright & Miller”).   \nThat is true even when the claim is for nominal damages.  See Wright & Miller \n§ 3533.3, n.47 (collecting cases); see also N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of \n27 \n \n\nNew York, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting) (same).  Under this Circuit’s \nprecedent, “even if a plaintiff’s injunctive relief claim has been mooted, the action is not \nmoot if the plaintiff may be ‘entitled to at least nominal damages.’”  Rendelman v. Rouse, \n569 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Covenant Media of S.C., LLC v. City of N. \nCharleston, 493 F.3d 421, 429 n.4 (4th Cir. 2007)).  And the implications are particularly \nimportant in the civil rights context, because such rights are often vindicated through \nnominal damages.  See N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc., 140 S. Ct. at 1535 (Alito, J., \ndissenting) (citing Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) (plurality opinion)); see \nalso Riverside, 477 U.S. at 574 (plurality opinion) (“Regardless of the form of relief he \nactually obtains, a successful civil rights plaintiff often secures important social benefits \nthat are not reflected in nominal or relatively small damages awards.”).6  \nNevertheless,  the  Board  analogizes  to  an  Eleventh  Circuit  en  banc  decision, \nFlanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia v. City of Sandy Springs, 868 F.3d 1248, 1263 \n(11th Cir. 2017).  But Flanigan’s Enterprises is unpersuasive because it is not on point. \nIn Flanigan’s Enterprises, the Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiff-appellants’ \nrequest for declaratory and injunctive relief from a city ordinance became moot when the \nCity repealed that ordinance “unambiguously and unanimously, in open session,” with \n \n6 Additionally, winning nominal damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 allows for a \nrecovery of attorney’s fees under 42  U.S.C. § 1988, thereby allowing plaintiffs  with \ninsufficient funds to hire an attorney at market rate, and with little prospect of a great \nrecovery, to be matched with a civil rights attorney.  See generally Riverside, 477 U.S. at \n576–80  (plurality  opinion)  (discussing  the  importance  of  the  § 1988  framework  for \nvindicating  civil  rights).    Holding that claims  for  nominal  damages  are moot  would \nundermine this framework by discouraging attorneys from taking cases such as Grimm’s.    \n28 \n \n\n“persuasive reasons for doing so.”  868 F.3d at 1263.  The City had “expressly, repeatedly, \nand publicly disavowed any intent to reenact [the challenged] provision,” which it had \n“never enforced in the first place.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit then turned \nto the appellants’ “lone” remaining request, nominal damages.  It explained that, in some \nsituations, nominal damages have a “practical effect” or are the “appropriate remedy”; in \nothers, nominal damages “would serve no purpose other than to affix a judicial seal of \napproval  to  an  outcome  that  has  already  been  realized.”    Id.  at  1264.    Flanigan’s \nEnterprises was “squarely of that last variety,” the court said, because the appellants had \n“already won.”  Id. \nFlanigan’s Enterprises is distinct at every turn.  Whereas the ordinance at issue in \nthat  case  had never  been  enforced,  and  had  been  publicly  retracted, here  the  Board \nunquestionably applied its policy against Grimm.  To this day, the Board and Grimm \n“vigorously contest” the legality of the bathroom policy as applied to Grimm.  See Chafin, \n133 S. Ct. at 1024 (holding that a case was not moot when the parties continued to \n“vigorously contest the question of where their daughter w[ould] be raised”).  Unlike the \nEleventh Circuit in Flanigan’s Enterprise, we are presented with a “live controversy,” Hall \nv. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48 (1969), that is “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \ndecision,” Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990).  As seen by this drawn-\nout litigation, it will only be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  \n \n \n29 \n \n\nB.  Administrative Exhaustion of School Records Decision \nSecond, the Board asserts that Grimm was required to exhaust his administrative \nremedies by requesting a hearing after he learned of the Board’s final decision.  “Where \nrelief is available from an administrative agency, the plaintiff is ordinarily required to \npursue that avenue of redress before proceeding to the courts; and until that recourse is \nexhausted, suit is premature and must be dismissed.”  Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 269 \n(1993).  The Board is correct that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 \n(FERPA), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, under which Grimm requested that his records be amended, \nprovides for a hearing.  See 34 C.F.R. § 99.20(c) (“If the educational agency or institution \ndecides not to amend the record as requested, it shall inform the parent or eligible student \nof its decision and of his or her right to a hearing under § 99.21.”).  When read together \nwith broader agency  principles, the Board  believes that FERPA’s regulatory hearing \nprovision demands exhaustion.  \nIn sharp contrast to a statute like the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), \nwhich demands “proper exhaustion,” see Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 93 (2006), the \nFERPA says nothing about exhausting administrative remedies.  Cf. PLRA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997e(a) (“No action shall be brought . . . until such administrative remedies as are \navailable are exhausted.”).  Facing Congressional silence, rather than an express exhaustion \nprovision, “sound judicial discretion governs.”  McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 \n(1992), superseded on other grounds by statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).   \nEven when considering a different education statute with an explicit exhaustion \nrequirement, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l), \n30 \n \n\nthe  Supreme  Court  held  that  its  exhaustion  requirement  is  not  implicated  when  the \ngravamen of the suit is disability discrimination in violation of other federal laws, rather \nthan a more direct violation of the IDEA itself.  See Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., 137 S. \nCt. 743, 755 (2017).  And here, the “gravamen” of Grimm’s suit is discrimination, rather \nthan technical violations of the FERPA.  See Fry, 137 S. Ct. at 755.7  Grimm is not \ncomplaining that the Board failed to follow the FERPA, but rather that it acted in a \ndiscriminatory manner when it refused to amend his records. \nWe may ask ourselves what benefit a hearing could have provided Grimm, when \nthe Board continues to deny his request in the face of both a court order stating that his sex \nis male and a declaration from the State Registrar affirming the validity of his new birth \ncertificate.  If the FERPA ever implicitly demands such complete exhaustion, it does not \ndo so in a discrimination case such as this one.   \n \n \nIV.  Grimm’s Equal Protection Claim \nHolding that Grimm’s challenges to the bathroom policy are not moot, and that he \nneed not have strictly exhausted his administrative remedies as to his school records, we \nturn to the merits of his claims, beginning with his constitutional claim that both the \n \n7 The Board cites one case that, in its view, suggests that FERPA has an exhaustion \nrequirement.  But that case holds only that the student must at least provide the school with \ndocumentation of a gender change before suing.  See Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of \nCom. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 3d 657, 663 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (rejecting transgender \nstudent’s claims arising out of the school’s failure to amend his records because the student \nhad not presented a court order or birth certificate, and never followed through). \n31 \n \n\nrestroom policy and the failure to amend his school records violated equal protection, as \napplied to him.   \nWe address the Board’s two challenged actions in turn.  In doing so, we review the \ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to Grimm de novo.  See Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 \nF.3d 352, 370 (4th Cir. 2014).  Summary judgment is only appropriate when there is “no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact” and “the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.”  Ret. Comm. of DAK Ams. LLC v. Brewer, 867 F.3d 471, 479 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).  \n \nA.  The Board’s Restroom Policy \nTo analyze Grimm’s as-applied constitutional challenge to the Board’s restroom \npolicy, we must begin with the equal protection framework.  The Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within \nits jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  It is \n“essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The Equal Protection Clause \nprotects us not just from state-imposed classifications, but also from “intentional and \narbitrary discrimination.”  See Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per \ncuriam) (quoting Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota Cty., 260 U.S. 441, 445 (1923)); see also \nJack M. Balkin & Reva B. Siegel, The American Civil Rights Tradition: Anticlassification \nor Antisubordination?, 58 U. Miami L. Rev. 9 (2003) (explaining that the Equal Protection \nClause contains both anticlassification and antisubordination principles).  Put another way, \n32 \n \n\nstate action is unconstitutional when it creates “arbitrary or irrational” distinctions between \nclasses  of  people  out  of  “a  bare  . . .  desire  to  harm  a  politically  unpopular  group.”  \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 446–47 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 \n(1973));  see  also  United  States  v.  Virginia,  518  U.S.  515,  534  (1996)  (sex-based \nclassifications “may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, \nand economic inferiority of women” (citation omitted)). \nWhen considering an equal protection claim, we first determine what level of \nscrutiny applies; then, we ask whether the law or policy at issue survives such scrutiny.  \nFor the reasons that follow, we conclude that heightened scrutiny applies to Grimm’s claim \nbecause the bathroom policy rests on sex-based classifications and because transgender \npeople constitute at least a quasi-suspect class.  Therefore, to withstand judicial scrutiny, \nthe Board’s bathroom policy must be “substantially related to a sufficiently important \ngovernmental interest.”  See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441.  Because we hold that the Board’s \npolicy as applied to Grimm is not substantially related to the important objective of \nprotecting student privacy, we affirm summary judgment to Grimm. \n \n1. \nIn determining what level of scrutiny applies to a plaintiff’s equal protection claim, \nwe look to the basis of the distinction between the classes of persons.  See generally United \nStates v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).  Representing two ends of \nthe scrutiny spectrum, most classifications are generally benign and are upheld so long as \nthey are “rationally related to a legitimate state interest,” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, \n33 \n \n\nwhereas  race-based  classifications  are  “inherently  suspect”  and  must  be  “strictly \nscrutinized,” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 223–24 (1995) (internal \nquotation mark omitted). \nSex is somewhere in the middle, constituting a quasi-suspect class.  Sex8 is only \nquasi-suspect because, although it “frequently bears no relation to the ability to perform or \ncontribute to society,’” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440–41 (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, \n411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality opinion)), the Supreme Court has recognized “inherent \ndifferences” between the biological sexes that might provide appropriate justification for \ndistinctions, see Virginia, 518 U.S. at 534 (citing, as examples of appropriate sex-based \ndistinctions,  “compensat[ing]  women  for  particular  economic  disabilities”  and  \n“promot[ing] equal employment opportunity” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also \nTuan  Anh  Nguyen  v.  I.N.S.,  533  U.S.  53,  73  (2001)  (holding  that  less  burdensome \ncitizenship application requirements for the child of a citizen mother than that of a citizen \nfather withstands intermediate scrutiny, in part because “[t]o fail to acknowledge even our \nmost basic biological differences—such as the fact that a mother must be present at birth \nbut the father need not be—risks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and \nso disserving it”).   \n \n8 We acknowledge that the Supreme Court has, in certain equal protection cases, \nused both the terms “gender” and “sex” interchangeably.  See, e.g., Miss. Univ. for Women \nv. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982); Virginia, 518 U.S. at 515.  Therefore, Grimm has preserved \nan argument that transgender individuals necessarily fall under this line of cases based on \ngender discrimination.  Because we need not reach this question in order to resolve \nGrimm’s appeal, we treat this line of cases on perhaps its narrower terms—that is, as \nreferring to classifications based on biological sex. \n34 \n \n\nBecause sex-based classifications are quasi-suspect, they are subject to a form of \nheightened scrutiny.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440–41.  Specifically, they are subject to \nintermediate scrutiny, meaning that they “fail[] unless [they are] substantially related to a \nsufficiently important governmental interest.”  See id. at 441.  To survive intermediate \nscrutiny,  the  state  must  provide  an  “exceedingly  persuasive  justification”  for  its \nclassification.  See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 534.   \n   \na. \nOn its face, the Board’s policy creates sex-based classifications for restrooms.  It \nstates that the school district will “provide male and female restroom and locker room \nfacilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding \nbiological genders.”  J.A. 775.  The only logical reading is that “corresponding biological \ngenders” refers back to “male and female.”  And, although the Board did not define \n“biological gender,” it has defended its policy by taking the position that it will rely on the \nsex marker on the student’s birth certificate.  We agree with the Seventh and now Eleventh \nCircuits that when a “School District decides which bathroom a student may use based \nupon the sex listed on the student’s birth certificate,” the policy necessarily rests on a sex \nclassification.    See  Whitaker,  858  F.3d  at  1051  (applying  heightened  scrutiny  to  a \ntransgender student’s equal protection claim regarding a bathroom policy); see also Adams \nex. rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cty., No. 18-13592, 2020 WL 4561817, at *5 (11th \nCir. Aug. 7, 2020) (same).  As in Whitaker, such a policy “cannot be stated without \n35 \n \n\nreferencing sex.”  See id.; accord M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 719.  On that ground alone, \nheightened scrutiny should apply.   \nMoreover,  and  as  the  district  court  held,  “Grimm  was  subjected  to  sex \ndiscrimination  because  he  was  viewed  as  failing  to  conform  to  the  sex  stereotype \npropagated by the Policy.”  Grimm, 302 F. Supp. 3d at 750.  Many courts, including the \nSeventh and Eleventh Circuits, have held that various forms of discrimination against \ntransgender  people  constitute  sex-based  discrimination  for  purposes  of  the  Equal \nProtection  Clause  because  such  policies  punish  transgender  persons  for  gender  non-\nconformity, thereby relying on sex stereotypes.  See, e.g., Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 \n(holding that the School District’s bathroom policy “treat[ed] transgender students . . . who \nfail to conform to the sex-based stereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth, \ndifferently”); Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir. 2011) (“Ever since the \nSupreme  Court  began  to  apply  heightened  scrutiny  to  sex-based  classifications,  its \nconsistent  purpose  has  been  to  eliminate  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  gender \nstereotypes.”); Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 573–75; 578 (6th Cir. 2004) (applying \na sex-stereotyping theory, albeit without mentioning a level of scrutiny, and holding that \nthe transgender plaintiff stated a sex discrimination claim in violation of equal protection); \nM.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 719 (holding that a school locker room policy was subject to \nheightened scrutiny because it “classifie[d] [the plaintiff] differently on the basis of his \ntransgender status, and, as a result, subject[ed] him to sex stereotyping”); see also Doe 1 v. \nTrump, 275 F. Supp. 3d 167, 210 (D.D.C. 2017) (military bans on transgender persons \nsubject to heightened scrutiny because they “punish individuals for failing to adhere to \n36 \n \n\ngender stereotypes”), vacated sub nom. Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 755 F. App’x 19 (D.C. Cir. \n2019); Stone v. Trump, 280 F. Supp. 3d 747, 768 (D. Md. 2017) (adopting Doe 1 rationale); \nNorsworthy  v.  Beard,  87  F.  Supp.  3d  1104,  1119  (N.D.  Cal.  2015)  (holding  that \ndiscrimination on the basis of transgender status is subject to intermediate scrutiny in part \nunder sex-stereotyping theory).9  In so holding, these courts have recognized a central tenet \nof equal protection in sex discrimination cases: that states “must not rely on overbroad \ngeneralizations” regarding the sexes.  See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; see also Miss. Univ. \nfor Women, 458 U.S. at 724–25 (“Although the test for determining the validity of a gender-\nbased classification is straightforward, it must be applied free of fixed notions concerning \nthe roles and abilities of males and females.”). \nFor each of these independent reasons, we hold that the Board’s policy constitutes \nsex-based  discrimination  as  to  Grimm  and  is  subject  to  intermediate  scrutiny.    And \nalthough  the  Board  raises  two  related  counterarguments  in  an  effort  to  convince  us \notherwise, we reject them both.   \nFirst, the Board contends that all students are treated the same, regardless of sex, \nbecause the policy applies to everyone equally.  See Reply Br. 16 (noting that any student \nmay use a “private, single-stall restroom,” and “[n]o student is  permitted to  use the \n \n9 As relied on by the Board, one 2015 district court case goes the other way, \nJohnston, 97 F. Supp. 3d at 671, but the same district court later chose not to follow that \ndecision, see Evancho v. Pine–Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 287 (W.D. Pa. \n2017) (“Johnston also acutely recognized that cases involving transgender status implicate \na fast-changing and rapidly-evolving set of issues that must be considered in their own \nfactual contexts.  To be sure, Johnston's prognostication of that reality was profoundly \naccurate.” (citation omitted)). \n37 \n \n\nrestroom of the opposite sex”).  But that is like saying that racially segregated bathrooms \ntreated everyone equally, because everyone was prohibited from using the bathroom of a \ndifferent race.  No one would suppose that also providing a “race neutral” bathroom option \nwould have solved the deeply stigmatizing and discriminatory nature of racial segregation; \nso too here.  Rather, the Board said what it meant: “students with gender identity issues \nshall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility.”  J.A. 775.  The single-stall \nrestrooms were created for “students with gender identity issues.”  And by “students,” the \nBoard apparently meant Grimm, as, per its own deposition witness, it “only ha[d] a sample \nsize of one.”  J.A. 458.  The Board suggests that this purpose insulates its policy from \nintermediate scrutiny, because it shows that the policy “relies solely on transgender status.”  \nSee Opening Br. 46.  But again, how does the Board determine transgender status, if not \nby looking to what it calls “biological gender”? \nSecond, the Board contends that even if the policy necessarily involves sex-based \ndiscrimination, it cannot violate equal protection because Grimm is not similarly situated \nto cisgender boys.  Instead, it asks us to compare Grimm’s treatment under the policy to \nthe treatment of students it would consider to be “biological” girls, because Grimm’s \n“choice of gender identity did not cause biological changes in his body, and Grimm \nremain[ed] biologically female.”  Opening Br. 46.  But embedded in the Board’s framing \nis its own bias: it believes that Grimm’s gender identity is a choice, and it privileges sex-\nassigned-at-birth over Grimm’s medically confirmed, persistent and consistent gender \nidentity.  The policy itself “recognizes that some students question their gender identities,” \nand states that such students have “gender identity issues.”  J.A. 775.  Grimm, however, \n38 \n \n\ndid not question his gender identity at all; he knew he was a boy.  See Adams ex rel. Kasper \nv. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cty., 318 F. Supp. 3d 1293, 1317 (M.D. Fla. 2018) (“There is no \nevidence to suggest that [the transgender plaintiff’s] identity as a boy is any less consistent, \npersistent and insistent than any other boy.”).  The overwhelming thrust of everything in \nthe record—from Grimm’s declaration, to his treatment letter, to the amicus briefs—is that \nGrimm was similarly situated to other boys, but was excluded from using the boys restroom \nfacilities based on his sex-assigned-at-birth.  Adopting the Board’s framing of Grimm’s \nequal protection claim here would only vindicate the Board’s own misconceptions, which \nthemselves reflect “stereotypic notions.”  See Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 725 \n(“Care must be taken in ascertaining whether the [state’s] objective itself reflects archaic \nand stereotypic notions.”).10  \n \nb. \nAlternatively, and as  held by the district court in this case, we  conclude that \nheightened scrutiny applies because transgender people constitute at least a quasi-suspect \nclass.   \nAlthough the Seventh Circuit declined to reach the question of whether heightened \nscrutiny applies to transgender persons in Whitaker, many district courts, including the \n \n10 Our dissenting colleague’s opinion reveals why this is so.  To avoid a conclusion \nthat Grimm was similarly situated to other boys, the dissent fails to “meaningfully reckon \nwith what it means for [Grimm] to be a transgender boy.”  See Adams, 2020 WL 4561817, \nat *2 n.2; see also Dissenting Op. at 93–94.  We have been presented with a strong record \ndocumenting the modern medical understanding of what it means to be transgender, and \nconsidering that evidence is definitively the role of this Court. \n39 \n \n\ndistrict court here, have analyzed the relevant factors for determining suspect class status \nand held that transgender people are at least a quasi-suspect class.  See Evancho v. Pine–\nRichland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 288 (W.D. Pa. 2017) (holding that transgender \npeople constitute a quasi-suspect class); Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, \n139 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (same); Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 873 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (same); M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at \n718–19 (same); Norsworthy, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 1119 (same); F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. \n3d 1131, 1145 (D. Idaho 2018) (same); Flack v. Wis. Dep’t of Health Servs., 328 F. Supp. \n3d 931, 951–53 (W.D. Wis. 2018) (explaining in a ruling on a preliminary injunction why \nheightened scrutiny would likely apply to transgender persons).11  As articulated by one \ndistrict court, “one would be hard-pressed to identify a class of people more discriminated \nagainst historically or otherwise more deserving of the application of heightened scrutiny \nwhen singled out for adverse treatment, than transgender people.”  Flack, 328 F. Supp. 3d \nat 953.  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit recently joined the many district courts in holding that \ntransgender people constitute a quasi-suspect class.  See Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, \n1200 (9th Cir. 2019) (affirming the district court’s reasoning as to why transgender people \nare a quasi-suspect class).  Only one court of appeals decision holding otherwise remains \ngood law, but it reluctantly followed a since-overruled Ninth Circuit opinion.  See Brown \nv. Zavaras, 63 F.3d 967, 971 (10th Cir. 1995) (noting that “[r]ecent research concluding \n \n11  The Eleventh Circuit was not presented with this question in Adams because the \nparties agreed that heightened scrutiny applied to the plaintiff’s  claim based on  that \nCircuit’s precedent in Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1319. See Adams, 2020 WL 4561817, at *4. \n40 \n \n\nthat  sexual  identity  may  be  biological  suggests  reevaluation  of  [Holloway  v.  Arthur \nAndersen & Co. 566 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1977),]” but following it regardless because the \nplaintiff’s allegations were “too conclusory to allow proper analysis”).   \nEngaging  with  the  suspect  class  test,  it  is  apparent  that  transgender  persons \nconstitute a quasi-suspect class.  We consider four factors to determine whether a group of \npeople constitutes a suspect or quasi-suspect class.  First, we consider whether the class \nhas historically been subject to discrimination.  Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987).  Second, we determine if the class has a defining characteristic that bears a relation \nto its ability to perform or contribute to society.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440–41.  Third, we \nlook to whether the class may be defined as a discrete group by obvious, immutable, or \ndistinguishing characteristics.  Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602.  And fourth, we consider whether \nthe class is a minority lacking political power.  Id.  Each factor is readily satisfied here. \nFirst, take historical discrimination.  Discrimination against transgender people \ntakes many forms.  Like the district court, we provide but a few examples to illustrate the \nbroader picture.  See Grimm, 302 F. Supp. 3d at 749 (“[T]here is no doubt that transgender \nindividuals historically have been subjected to discrimination on the basis of their gender \nidentity, including high rates of violence and discrimination in education, employment, \nhousing, and healthcare access.” (collecting cases)).  As explained in the Brief of the \nMedical Amici, being transgender was pathologized for many years.  As recently as the \nDSM-3 and DSM-4, one could receive a diagnosis of “transsexualism” or “gender identity \ndisorder,” “indicat[ing] that the clinical problem was the discordant gender identity.”  See \nJohn W. Barnhill, Introduction, in DSM-5 Clinical Cases 237–38 (John W. Barnhill ed., \n41 \n \n\n2014).  Whereas “homosexuality” was removed from the DSM in 1973, “gender identity \ndisorder” was not removed until the DSM-5 was published in 2013.  See Kevin M. Barry \net al., A Bare Desire to Harm: Transgender People and the Equal Protection Clause, 57 \nB.C. L. Rev. 507, 509–10, 517 (2016).  What is more, even though being transgender was \nmarked as a mental illness, coverage for transgender persons was excluded from the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) after a floor debate in which two senators \nreferred to these diagnoses as “sexual behavior disorders.”  See Barry et al., supra, at 510; \nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b)(1).  The following year, Congress added an identical \nexclusion to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, “stripping transgender people of civil rights \nprotections they had enjoyed for nearly twenty years.”  Barry et al., supra, at 556; see also \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-973, at 158 (1992). \nThe  transgender  community  also  suffers  from  high  rates  of  employment \ndiscrimination,  economic  instability,  and  homelessness.    According  to  the  National \nTransgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS),12 people who are transgender are twice as \nlikely as the general population to have experienced unemployment.  When employed, 97% \nof NTDS respondents reported experiencing some form of mistreatment at work, or “hiding \ntheir gender transition to avoid such treatment.”  Barry et al., supra, at 552.  NTDS \nrespondents were “four times more likely than the general population to have a household \n \n12 The NTDS is a major national survey on transgender discrimination.  Along with \nits successor, the USTS, the NTDS has been relied upon by many amici to this case, as \nwell as other courts.  See, e.g., Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (citing to the NTDS); M.A.B., \n286 F. Supp. 3d at 720 (citing to both the NTDS and the USTS); Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d \nat 139 (relying on the NTDS). \n42 \n \n\nincome of less than $10,000 per year,” and two and a half times more likely to have \nexperienced homelessness.  Id. \nThat is not all.  Transgender people frequently experience harassment in places such \nas schools (78%), medical settings (28%), and retail stores (37%), and they also experience \nphysical assault in places such as schools (35%) and places of public accommodation (8%).  \nSee id. at 553.  Indeed, transgender people are more likely to be the victim of violent crimes.  \nId.  So, in 2009, Congress expanded federal protections against hate crimes to include \ncrimes based on gender identity.  Id.  at 555.  In so doing, the House Judiciary Committee \nrecognized the “extreme bias against gender nonconformity” and the “particularly violent” \ncrimes perpetrated against transgender persons.  See id.   \nOf course, current measures and policies continue to target transgender persons for \ndifferential treatment.  Without opining on the legality of such measures, we note that \npolicies precluding transgender persons from military service, even after the repeal of \n“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” see Gary J. Gates & Jody L. Herman, Transgender Military \nService in the United States 1 (2014), have recently been re-implemented as to most \ntransgender service members.  And this year, the Governor of Idaho signed into law a bill \nthat would ban transgender individuals from changing the gender marker on their birth \ncertificates, as Virginia law allowed Grimm to do.  Further still, the Department of Health \nand  Human  Services  recently  issued  a  final  rule  redefining  “sex  discrimination”  for \npurposes of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to encompass only biological sex, \nand not gender identity.  The list surely goes on. \n43 \n \n\nNext, we turn to the second factor—whether the class has a defining characteristic \nthat “bears [a] relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.’”  Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 440–41 (quoting Frontiero, 441 U.S. at 677).  Being transgender bears no such relation.  \nSeventeen of our foremost medical, mental health, and public health organizations agree \nthat being transgender “implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general \nsocial or vocational capabilities.”  See Br. of Medical Amici 6 (quoting Am. Psychiatric \nAss’n, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant \nIndividuals  1  (2012)).    Although  some  transgender  individuals  experience  gender \ndysphoria, and that could cause some level of impairment, not all transgender persons have \ngender dysphoria, and gender dysphoria is treatable.  See id.  “Importantly, ‘transgender’ \nand ‘impairment’ are not synonymous.”  Barry et al., supra, at 558.   \nThat leaves the third and fourth factors.  As to the third factor, transgender people \nconstitute a discrete group with immutable characteristics: Recall that gender identity is \nformulated for most people at a very early age, and, as our medical amici explain, being \ntransgender is not a choice.  Rather, it is as natural and immutable as being cisgender.  Br. \nof Medical Amici 7.  But unlike being cisgender, being transgender marks the group for \ndifferent treatment.   \nFourth and finally, transgender people constitute a minority lacking political power.  \nComprising approximately 0.6% of the adult population in the United States, transgender \nindividuals are certainly a minority.  Even considering the low percentage of the population \nthat  is  transgender,  transgender  persons  are  underrepresented  in  every  branch  of \ngovernment.  It was not until 2010 that the first openly transgender judges took their place \n44 \n \n\non their states’ benches, see First Two Openly Transgender Judges in the U.S. Appointed \nLast  Month,  Women’s  Law  Project  (Dec.  7,  2010), \nhttps://www.womenslawproject.org/2010/12/07/first-two-openly-transgender-judges-in-\nthe-u-s-appointed-last-month/, and we know of no openly transgender federal judges.  \nThere is a similar dearth of openly transgender persons serving in the executive and \nlegislative branches.  In 2017, nine openly transgender individuals were elected to office—\nmore than doubling the total number of transgender individuals in any elected office across \nthe country.  See Brooke Sopelsa, Meet 2017’s Newly Elected Transgender Officials, NBC \nNews (Dec. 28, 2017, 9:06 AM EST), https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/meet-\n2017-s-newly-elected-transgender-officials-n832826;  see  also  Logan  S.  Casey, \nTransgender Candidates, https://www.loganscasey.com/trans-candidates-project.  And the \nexamples of discrimination cited under the first factor affirm what we intuitively know: \nTransgender people constitute a minority that has not yet been able to meaningfully \nvindicate their rights through the political process. \nThe Board does not, and truly cannot, contend that transgender people do not \nconstitute a quasi-suspect class under these four factors.  Instead, it counsels judicial \nmodesty, suggesting that we are admonished not to name  new suspect classes.  See \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 441–42 (“[W]here individuals in the group affected by a law have \ndistinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the State has the authority to implement, \nthe courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our \nrespect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices as to whether, \nhow, and to what extent those interests should be pursued.”); see also Johnston, 97 F. Supp. \n45 \n \n\n3d at 668–69.  But no hard-and-fast rule prevents this Court from concluding that a quasi-\nsuspect  class  exits,  nor  have  Cleburne’s  dicta  prevented  many  other  courts  from  so \nconcluding.  \nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Board’s restroom policy constitutes sex-\nbased  discrimination  and, independently,  that  transgender  persons  constitute  a  quasi-\nsuspect class.   \n2. \n  Whether  because  the  policy  constitutes  sex-based  discrimination  or  because \ntransgender persons are a quasi-suspect class, we apply heightened scrutiny to hold that the \nBoard’s policy is not substantially related to its important interest in protecting students’ \nprivacy.13 \nNo one questions that students have a privacy interest in their body when they go to \nthe bathroom.  But the Board ignores the reality of how a transgender child uses the \nbathroom: “by entering a stall and closing the door.”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052; see also \nAdams, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1296, 1314 (“When he goes into a restroom, [the transgender \nstudent] enters a stall, closes the door, relieves himself, comes out of the stall, washes his \nhands, and leaves.”).  Grimm used the boys restrooms for seven weeks without incident.  \nWhen the community became aware that he was doing so, privacy in the boys restrooms \nactually increased, because the Board installed privacy strips and screens between the \nurinals.  Given these additional precautions, the Board’s Rule 30(b)(6) deposition witness \n \n13 Grimm argues on appeal that he wins even under rational basis review.  In light \nof our holding above, we need not analyze his claim under that level of review.   \n46 \n \n\ncould not identify any other privacy concern.  The Board does not present any evidence \nthat a transgender student, let alone Grimm, is likely to be a peeping tom, rather than \nminding  their  own  business  like  any  other  student.    Put  another  way,  the  record \ndemonstrates that bodily privacy of cisgender boys using the boys restrooms did not \nincrease when Grimm was banned from those restrooms.  Therefore, the Board’s policy \nwas not substantially related to its purported goal. \nThe insubstantiality of the Board’s fears has been borne out in school districts across \nthe country, including other school districts in Virginia.  Nearly half of Virginia’s public-\nschool students attend schools prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on gender \nidentity.  See Br. of Virginia School Board Amici 4.  Although community members \nespoused similar fears at school board meetings before the anti-discrimination measures, \nnone of those fears have materialized.  Id. at 17–19.  Those Virginia school boards have \nhad no difficulty implementing trans-inclusive bathroom policies and explain that they \n“have seen none of the negative consequences predicted by opponents of such policies.”  \nId. at 5.   \nThe same can be said across the country.  See Br. of School Administrator Amici \n18–24  (explaining that  in  amici’s states,  the  concerns  raised  by  the  Board  have  not \nmaterialized).  One school administrator in Kentucky, who was previously against allowing \ntransgender students to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender, explained that his \nexperience  with  shifting  the  policy  demonstrated  that  all  the  concerns  were \n“philosophical.”  Id. at 17.  In these administrators’ experiences, “showing respect for each \nstudent’s gender identity supports the dignity and worth of all students by affording them \n47 \n \n\nequal opportunities to participate and learn.”  Id. at 32.  And the National PTA, GLSEN, \nAmerican  School  Counselor  Association,  and  National  Association  of  School \nPsychologists similarly assure us that the experiences of schools and school districts across \nthe country “put the lie to supposed legitimate justifications for restroom discrimination: \npreventing students who pretend to be transgender from obtaining access to opposite-\ngender restrooms and protecting privacy.”  Br. of Education Association Amici 6. \nWe thus agree with the district court’s apt conclusion that “the Board’s privacy \nargument ‘is based upon sheer conjecture and abstraction.’”  Grimm, 400 F. Supp. 3d at \n461 (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052).  The Board cites to no incident, either in \nGloucester County or elsewhere.  It ignores the growing number of school districts across \nthe country who are successfully allowing transgender students such as Grimm to use the \nbathroom matching their gender identity, without incident.  And it ignores its own seven-\nweek experience with doing the same in Gloucester County High School.  Notably, both \nthe Third and Ninth Circuits have now rejected privacy-related challenges brought by \ncisgender students to the shared use of restrooms with transgender students of the opposite \nbiological sex.  See Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe ex rel. \nDoe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518 (3rd Cir. 2018).  And before this opinion \nwas filed, the Eleventh Circuit, applying heightened scrutiny to a transgender student’s \nequal  protection  challenge  to  his  high  school’s  bathroom  policy,  similarly  held  that \napplication of the policy did not withstand such scrutiny due, in part, to the hypothetical \nnature of the asserted privacy concerns.  See Adams, 2020 WL 4561817, at *4–5, 7. \n48 \n \n\nMoreover, we conclude that the Board’s policy is “marked by misconception and \nprejudice” against Grimm.  See Tuan Anh Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73.  The Board’s proposed \npolicy was concocted amidst a flurry of emails from apparently concerned community \nmembers and adopted in the context of two heated Board meetings filled with vitriolic, off-\nthe-cuff comments, such as referring to Grimm as a “freak.”  Parents threatened to vote out \nthe Board members if they allowed Grimm to continue to use the boys restrooms.  One \nwould be hard-pressed to look at the record and think that the Board sought to understand \nGrimm’s transgender status or his medical need to socially transition, as identified by his \ntreating physician.  Rather, in a moment when he was finally able to affirm his gender, the \nBoard  treated  Grimm  as  “questioning”  his  identity  and  lumped  his  in  with  what  it \nconsidered to be “gender identity issues.”   \nBy  relying  on  so-called  “biological  gender,”  the  Board  successfully  excluded \nGrimm from the boys restrooms.  But it did not create a policy that it could apply to other \nstudents, such as students who had fully transitioned but had not yet changed their sex on \ntheir birth certificate.  As demonstrated by the record and amici such as interACT, the \nBoard’s policy is not readily applicable to other students who, for whatever reason, do not \nhave genitalia that match the binary sex listed on their birth certificate—let alone that \nmatches their gender identity.  See Br. for Amicus Curiae interACT: Advocates for Intersex \nYouth in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 20–23.  Instead, the Board reacted to what it considered a \nproblem, Grimm’s presence, by isolating him from his peers.  \n \n49 \n \n\nB.  The Board’s Failure to Amend Grimm’s School Records \n   Having held that the Board’s bathroom policy violated Grimm’s equal protection \nrights, we easily conclude that the Board’s continued refusal to update his school records \nsimilarly violates those rights.14  Unlike students whose gender matches their sex-assigned-\nat-birth, Grimm is unable to obtain a transcript indicating that he is male.  The Board’s \ndecision is not substantially related to its important interest in maintaining accurate records \nbecause Grimm’s legal gender in the state of Virginia is male, not female.   \nThe  Board’s  only  rebuttal  is  that  Grimm  did  not  provide  a  lawfully  obtained \namended birth certificate.  Recall that Grimm received a state-court order changing his \ngender to “male,” and he then presented the school with his amended birth certificate.  The \nBoard complains that the copy said “VOID,” that it did not say the word “amended,” and \nthat the Gloucester County Circuit Court granted Grimm’s motion to change his sex to \nmale based on chest reconstruction surgery.  As found by the district court, however: “It is \nobvious from the face of the amended birth certificate that the photocopy presented to the \nBoard was marked ‘void’ because it was a copy of a document printed on security paper, \nnot because it was fabricated.”  Grimm, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 458 n.6.  Moreover, while the \nBoard may disagree with the Gloucester County Circuit Court’s order granting Grimm’s \nmotion to change his sex to male because it believes that chest reconstruction does not \n \n14 The dissent does not address Grimm’s school records, presumably because it \nwould hold that Grimm is not similarly situated to other boys—full stop.  Yet Virginia \nrecognized Grimm as male and amended his birth certificate.  Although preserving sex-\nassigned-at-birth  separated  restrooms  may  rouse  more  sentiment,  the  less-contentious \nschool  records  issue  sheds  light  on  why  application  of  such  a  restroom  policy  to \ntransgender students is problematic. \n50 \n \n\nclassify as gender reassignment surgery under Virginia law, we must give full faith and \ncredit to that state court’s order, which cannot be collaterally attacked in this appeal.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1738.  And in the face of the declaration of State Registrar and Director of the \nDivision of Vital Records assuring that she issued Grimm a valid amended birth certificate, \nwe grow weary of the Board’s repeated arguments that it received anything less than an \nofficial document.   \n \n*  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment \nto Grimm on his equal protection claim. \n \n \nV.  Grimm’s Title IX Claim \nWe next address Grimm’s claim that the Board’s restroom policy and refusal to \namend his school records also violated Title IX.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person . . . \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  To grant summary judgment to Grimm on his \nTitle IX claim, we must find (1) that he was excluded from participation in an education \nprogram “on the basis of sex”; (2) that the educational institution was receiving federal \nfinancial assistance at the time; and (3) that improper discrimination caused him harm.   See \nPreston v. Va. ex rel. New River Cmty. Coll., 31 F.3d 203, 206 (4th Cir. 1994).  There is \nno question that the Board received federal funding or that restrooms are part of the \n51 \n \n\neducation program.  At issue in this case is whether the Board acted “on the basis of sex,” \nand if so, whether that was unlawful discrimination that harmed Grimm. \n \n \nA.  The Board’s Restroom Policy \nWe first address the restroom policy.  After the Supreme Court’s recent decision in \nBostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), we have little difficulty holding that a \nbathroom policy precluding Grimm from using the boys restrooms discriminated against \nhim “on the basis of sex.”  Although Bostock interprets Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1), it guides our evaluation of claims under Title IX.  See \nJennings v. Univ. of N.C., 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007); cf. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable \nSch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 258 (2009) (“Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI . . . and \npassed Title IX with the explicit understanding that it would be interpreted as Title VI \nwas.” (citation omitted)).  In Bostock, the Supreme Court held that discrimination against \na person for being transgender is discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  As the Supreme \nCourt noted, “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or \ntransgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”  Bostock, 140 S. \nCt. at 1741.  That is because the discriminator is necessarily referring to the individual’s \nsex to determine incongruence between sex and gender, making sex a but-for cause for the \ndiscriminator’s actions.  See id. at 1741–42.  As explained above in the equal protection \ndiscussion,  the  Board  could  not  exclude  Grimm  from  the  boys  bathrooms  without \nreferencing his “biological gender” under the policy, which it has defined as the sex marker \non his birth certificate.  Even if the Board’s primary motivation in implementing or \n52 \n \n\napplying the policy was to exclude Grimm because he is transgender, his sex remains a \nbut-for cause for the Board’s actions.  Therefore, the Board’s policy excluded Grimm from \nthe boys restrooms “on the basis of sex.”15  \nWe similarly have no difficulty holding that Grimm was harmed.  As the district \ncourt found: \nIn his Declaration, Mr. Grimm described under oath feeling stigmatized and \nisolated by having to use separate restroom facilities.  His  walk to the \nrestroom felt like a “walk of shame.”  He avoided using the restroom as much \nas possible and developed painful urinary tract infections that distracted him \nfrom his class work.  This stress “was unbearable” and the resulting suicidal \nthoughts he suffered led to his hospitalization at Virginia Commonwealth \nUniversity Medical Center Critical Care Hospital.   \n \nGrimm, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 458 (citations omitted).  Grimm also “broke down sobbing” \nwhen a restroom was unavailable after school, and he could not attend football games \nwithout worrying about where he would use the restroom.  See id. at 459.   \n \n15  We  pause  to  note  another  theory  under  which  Grimm  may  have  been \ndiscriminated “on the basis of sex.”  In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court \nheld that sex stereotyping constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender for purposes of \nTitle VII.  See 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989) (“In the specific context of sex stereotyping, an \nemployer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she \nmust not be, has acted on the basis of gender.”).  Various circuits have applied Price \nWaterhouse to Title VII gender stereotyping claims in the LGBTQ+ context, although we \nhave not.  Most notably, in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College, the Seventh Circuit \napplied the logic of Price Waterhouse and held in an en banc opinion that a lesbian woman \nwho was fired could state a Title VII gender-stereotyping claim.  See 853 F.3d 339, 351–\n52 (7th Cir. 2017) (en banc).  The district court similarly relied on Price Waterhouse below.  \nGrimm, 302 F. Supp. at 750.  For the reasons discussed above in the equal protection \nsection of our opinion, we agree that the policy punished Grimm for not conforming to his \nsex-assigned-at-birth.  But having had the benefit of Bostock’s guidance, we need not \naddress whether Grimm’s treatment was also “on the basis of sex” for purposes of Title IX \nunder a Price Waterhouse sex-stereotyping theory.   \n53 \n \n\nThe  Board  does  not  provide  evidence  contradicting  Grimm’s  or  his  mother’s \ndeclarations.  Rather, it has quibbled with the amount of harm Grimm felt, asserting below, \nfor example, that he needed a medical expert to prove urinary tract infections.  But in a \nnominal damages case, Grimm’s harm need not be precisely calculated.  For summary \njudgment purposes, it matters only that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether the bathroom policy harmed Grimm.  There is no question that Grimm suffered \nlegally cognizable harm for at least two reasons.   \nFirst, on a practical level, the physical locations of the alternative restrooms were \ninconvenient and caused Grimm harm.  The nurse’s room was far from his classes, as were \nthe three single-user restrooms.  The distance caused him to be late for class or away from \nclass for longer than students and teachers perceived as normal.  And when he attended \nafter-school events, he had to be driven away just to use the restroom. \nSecond,  in  a  country  with  a  history  of  racial  segregation,  we  know  that \n“[s]egregation  not  only  makes  for  physical  inconveniences,  but  it  does  something \nspiritually to an individual.”  Martin Luther King, Jr., “Some Things We Must Do,” \nAddress Delivered at the Second Annual Institute on Nonviolence and Social Change at \nHolt Street Baptist Church (Dec. 5, 1957); see also Br. of Amicus Curiae NAACP Legal \nDef. & Educ. Fund, Inc. in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 7 (outlining the harms and erroneous \nrationales of racial segregation).  The stigma of being forced to use a separate restroom is \nlikewise sufficient to constitute harm under Title IX, as it “invite[s] more scrutiny and \nattention” from other students, “very publicly brand[ing] all transgender students with a \nscarlet ‘T’.”  Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 530 (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045); see also \n54 \n \n\nid. (rejecting the suggestion that transgender students be offered single-stall restrooms, \nrather than be allowed to use the regular restrooms matching their gender identity).  Even \nGrimm’s high school principal “understood [Grimm’s] perception” that the policy sent the \nfollowing message: Gavin was not welcome.  J.A. 405–06.  Although the principal assumed \nsome  students  may  have  used  that  restroom,  Grimm never  saw  anyone  else  use  the \nrestrooms created for students with “gender identity issues.”  The resulting emotional and \ndignitary harm to Grimm is legally cognizable under Title IX.  See Adams, 2020 WL \n4561817, at *13, 16 (holding that a transgender student’s “psychological and dignitary \nharm” caused by a school bathroom policy was legally cognizable under Title IX). \nHaving determined that Grimm was harmed, we finally turn to the heart of the Title \nIX question in this case: whether the policy unlawfully discriminated against Grimm.  \nBostock expressly does not answer this “sex-separated restroom” question.  140 S. Ct. at \n1753.  In the Title IX context, discrimination “mean[s] treating that individual worse than \nothers who are similarly situated.”  Id. at 1740 (citing Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. \nWhite, 548 U.S. 53, 59 (2006)).  In light of our equal protection discussion above, this \nshould sound familiar: Grimm was treated worse than students with whom he was similarly \nsituated because he alone could not use the restroom corresponding with his gender.  Unlike \nthe other boys, he had to use either the girls restroom or a single-stall option.  In that sense, \nhe was treated worse than similarly situated students. \nNevertheless,  the  Board  emphasizes  a  Department  of  Education  implementing \nregulation, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which interprets Title IX to allow for “separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” so long as they are “comparable” to each \n55 \n \n\nother.  But Grimm does not challenge sex-separated restrooms; he challenges the Board’s \ndiscriminatory exclusion of himself from the sex-separated restroom matching his gender \nidentity.  See also Adams, 2020 WL 4561817, at *14 (holding that § 106.33 did not \npreclude a transgender student’s Title IX claim, because he was not challenging sex-\nseparated restrooms, but “simply seeking access to the boys’ restroom as a transgender \nboy.”).  And the implementing regulation cannot override the statutory prohibition against \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.  All it suggests is that the act of creating sex-separated \nrestrooms in and of itself is not discriminatory—not that, in applying bathroom policies to \nstudents like Grimm, the Board may rely on its own discriminatory notions of what “sex” \nmeans.16  See Adams, 2020 WL 4561817, at *15 (holding that “nothing in Bostock or the \nlanguage  of  § 106.33  justifie[d]  the  School  Board’s  discrimination”  against  a  male \ntransgender student seeking access to the boys restrooms).17   \n \n16 So too for the more generic Title IX provision allowing for sex-separated living \nfacilities.    See  20  U.S.C.  § 1686  (Title  IX  shall  not  “be  construed  to  prohibit  any \neducational institution” to which it applies “from maintaining separate living facilities for \nthe different sexes.”).  Again, this is a broad statement that sex-separated living facilities \nare not unlawful—not that schools may act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner when \ndividing students into those sex-separated facilities.  In any event, because 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33 is more specific to bathrooms, it is where the parties have focused their attention. \n \n17  The  dissent  suggests  that  Grimm  should  have  challenged  Title  IX  as \nunconstitutional, because Grimm’s use of the boys restrooms would somehow upend sex-\nseparated restrooms in schools.  See Dissenting Op. at 90.  But Grimm does not think that \nsex-separated restrooms are unconstitutional, and neither do we.  The dissent’s feared loss \nof sex-separated restrooms has not been borne out in any of the many school districts that \nallow  transgender  students  to  use  the  sex-separated  restroom  matching  their  gender \nidentity.  So it cannot be the physical loss of sex-separated restrooms that the dissent \nlaments, but some emotional, intangible loss wrought by the mere presence of transgender \npersons.  This type of argument calls to mind recent arguments against gay marriage, to \n(Continued) \n56 \n \n\nAs explained above, Grimm consistently and persistently identified as male.  He had \nbeen clinically diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and his treatment provider identified \nusing the boys restrooms as part of the appropriate treatment.  Rather than contend with \nGrimm’s  serious  medical  need,  the  Board  relied  on  its  own  invented  classification, \n“biological gender,” for which it turned to the sex on his birth certificate.  And even when \nGrimm provided the school with his amended birth certificate, the Board still denied him \naccess to the boys restrooms.  \nFor these reasons, we hold that the Board’s application of its restroom policy against \nGrimm violated Title IX.18 \n \n \n \nthe effect that allowing gay people to marry would “harm marriage as an institution.”  See \nObergefell  v.  Hodges,  135  S.  Ct.  2584,  2606  (2015).    With  no  “foundation  for  the \nconclusion” that such “harmful outcomes” would occur, see id., we similarly reject this \ninstitutional-harm type argument. \n \n18 Noting that Title IX was passed under the Spending Clause, the Board also asserts \nthat, if ambiguous, we must construe Title IX to allow application of its bathroom policy \nto Grimm in order to give the Board fair notice.  See generally Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  But Bostock forecloses that “on the basis of \nsex” is ambiguous as to discrimination against transgender persons, and notes that Title \nVII “has repeatedly produced unexpected applications, at least in the view of those on the \nreceiving end of them.”  See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (“Congress’s key drafting \nchoices—to focus on discrimination against individuals and not merely between groups \nand to hold employers liable whenever sex is a but-for cause of the plaintiff’s injuries—\nvirtually guaranteed that unexpected applications would emerge over time.”).  So too Title \nIX.  And the Board knew or should have known that the separate facilities regulation did \nnot override the broader statutory protection against discrimination.  We reject the Board’s \nPennhurst argument. \n57 \n \n\nB.  The Board’s Failure to Amend Grimm’s School Records  \n  Applying the same framework to the Board’s refusal to update Grimm’s school \nrecords, we hold that it too violated Title IX.  Again, the Board based its decision not to \nupdate Grimm’s school records on his sex—specifically, his sex as listed on his original \nbirth certificate, and as it presupposed him to be.  This decision harmed Grimm because \nwhen he applies to four-year universities, he will be asked for a transcript with a sex marker \nthat is incorrect and does not match his other documentation.  And this discrimination is \nunlawful because it treats him worse than other similarly situated students, whose records \nreflect their correct sex.  \n  Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment on Grimm’s \nTitle IX claim, and the relief granted, in full.   \n \n \nVI.  Conclusion \n  Grimm’s four years of high school were shaped by his fight to use the restroom that \nmatched  his  consistent  and  persistent  gender  identity.    In  the  face  of  adults  who \nmisgendered him and called him names, he spoke with conviction at two Board meetings.  \nThe solution was apparent: allow Grimm to use the boys restrooms, as he had been doing \nwithout incident.  But instead, the Board implemented a policy that treated Grimm as \n“questioning” his identity and having “issues,” and it sent him to special bathrooms that \nmight as well have said “Gavin” on the sign.  It did so while increasing privacy in the boys \nbathrooms, after which its own deposition witness could not cite a remaining privacy \nconcern.  We are left without doubt that the Board acted to protect cisgender boys from \n58 \n \n\nGavin’s mere presence—a special kind of discrimination against a child that he will no \ndoubt carry with him for life. \n  The Board did so despite advances in the medical community’s understanding of \nthe nature of being transgender and the importance of gender affirmation.  It did so after a \nmajor nationwide survey, the NTDS, put stark numbers to the harmful discrimination faced \nby transgender people in many aspects of their lives, including in school. \nIt also did so while schools across Virginia and across the country were successfully \nimplementing trans-inclusive bathroom policies, again, without incident.  Those schools’ \nexperiences, as outlined in three amicus briefs, demonstrate that hypothetical fears such as \nthe  “predator  myth”  were  merely  that—hypothetical.    Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  those \nschools also discovered that their biggest opponents were not students, but adults.  See Br. \nof School Administrator Amici 10–11.  One administrator noted: \nAs to the students, I am most impressed.  They are very understanding and \naccepting of their classmates.  It feels like the adult community is struggling \nwith it more.  \n \nId. at 10.  As another explained, “Young people are pretty savvy and comfortable, and can \nunderstand and empathize with someone who just wants to use the bathroom.”  Id.   \n  The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the \nburgeoning values of our bright youth, rather than preserve the prejudices of the past. \nCompare Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), and Bowers v. Hardwick, \n478 U.S. 186 (1986), with Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), and \nObergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).  How shallow a promise of equal protection \n59 \n \n\nthat would not protect Grimm from the fantastical fears and unfounded prejudices of his \nadult community.  \nIt is time to move forward.  The district court’s judgment is \nAFFIRMED. \n60 \n \n\nWYNN, Circuit Judge, concurring: \n \nI fully concur in Judge Floyd’s opinion and write separately to emphasize several \nparticularly  troublesome  aspects  of  the  Board’s  policy.  In  particular,  the  Board’s \nclassification on the basis of “biological gender”—defined in this appeal as the sex marker \non a student’s birth certificate—is arbitrary and provides no consistent reason to assign \ntransgender students to bathrooms on a binary male/female basis. Rather, the Board’s use \nof “biological gender” to classify students has the effect of shunting individuals like \nGrimm—who may not use the boys’ bathrooms because of their “biological gender,” and \nwho cannot use the girls’ bathrooms because of their gender identity—to a third category \nof bathroom altogether: the “alternative appropriate private facilit[ies]” established in the \npolicy for “students with gender identity issues.” \nThat  is  indistinguishable  from  the  sort  of  separate-but-equal  treatment  that  is \nanathema under our jurisprudence. No less than the recent historical practice of segregating \nBlack  and  white  restrooms,  schools,  and  other  public  accommodations,  the  unequal \ntreatment enabled by the Board’s policy produces a vicious and ineradicable stigma. The \nresult is to deeply and indelibly scar the most vulnerable among us—children who simply \nwish to be treated as equals at one of the most fraught developmental moments in their \nlives—by labeling them as unfit for equal participation in our society. And for what gain? \nThe Board has persisted in offering hypothetical and pretextual concerns that have failed \nto manifest, either in this case or in myriad others like it across our nation. I am left to \nconclude that the policy instead discriminates against transgender students out of a bare \ndislike or fear of those “others” who are all too often marginalized in our society for the \n61 \n \n\nmere fact that they are different. As such, the policy grossly offends the Constitution’s \nbasic guarantee of equal protection under the law. \nI. \nA. \nFirst, the Board’s policy provides no consistent basis for assigning transgender \nstudents—who often possess a mix of male and female physical characteristics—to a \nparticular bathroom. The policy, which was drafted by a Board member without consulting \nmedical professionals, purports to classify students based on their “biological gender.” J.A. \n775. As the district court noted, this term has no standard meaning (to say nothing of \nwidespread acceptance) in the medical field. See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 400 \nF. Supp. 3d 444, 457 (E.D. Va. 2019) (citing Wylie C. Hembree et al., Endocrine Treatment \nof  Gender-dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent  Persons:  An  Endocrine  Society  Clinical \nPractice  Guideline,  102(11),  J.  CLIN.  ENDOCRINOLOGY  &  METABOLISM  3869,  3875 \n(2017)).  Rather,  “biological  gender,”  on  its  face,  conflates  two  medical  concepts:  a \nperson’s biological sex (a set of physical traits) and gender (a deeply held sense of self). \nId. \nGiven that the Board seemingly created the concept of “biological gender” sua \nsponte, it comes as no surprise that it has struggled to define the term in a way that provides \nany consistent reason to assign a given transgender student to a male or female restroom. \n62 \n \n\nBroadly,  the  Board  claims  that  “biological  gender”  is  defined  solely  in  terms  of \nphysiological characteristics.1 \nThat suggests that the Board can identify some set of physical characteristics that \nfully identify someone as “male” or  “female”—and thus neatly  partition transgender \nstudents  into  those  two  categories.  Yet  the  Board  has  offered  no  set  of  physical \ncharacteristics  determinative  of  its  “biological  gender”  classification  in  the  five-year \npendency of this case.  \nNor could it, given that transgender individuals often defy binary categorization on \nthe  basis  of  physical  characteristics  alone.  For  instance,  although  Grimm  was  born \nphysically female and had female genitals during his time at Gloucester High, he also had \nphysical features commonly associated with the male sex: he lacked breasts (due to his \nchest reconstruction surgery); had facial hair, a deepened voice, and a more masculine \nappearance (due to hormone therapy); and presented as male through his haircut. The \nBoard  conveniently  ignores  all  these  facts,  other  than  to  claim  that  Grimm’s  chest \nreconstruction surgery “did not create any biological changes in Grimm, but instead, only \na physical change.” Opening Br. at 46. \nRather than address this reality, the Board has instead narrowed its definition of \n“biological gender” to refer to the sex marker on a student’s birth certificate—which, \nunless updated during a transgender individual’s transition, merely tells the Board what \n \n1 I note that the Board’s use of the term “gender” in “biological gender,” along with the \npolicy’s reference to students with “gender identity issues,” suggests that Grimm’s gender \nidentity  played  a  part  in  the  Board’s  bathroom  designation,  despite  the  Board’s \nprotestations to the contrary. J.A. 775. \n63 \n \n\nphysical sex characteristics a person was born with. But, as this case shows, a person’s \nbirth sex is not dispositive of their actual physiology. \nMoreover, by focusing on an individual’s birth certificate, the Board ensures the \npolicy  lacks  a  basic  consistency:  it  fails  to  treat  even  transgender  students  alike. \nSpecifically, the policy targets transgender students whose birth certificates do not match \ntheir outward physical characteristics while ignoring those transgender students whose \nbirth certificates are consistent with their outward physiology.  \nConsider a student physically identical to Grimm in every respect—that is, a student \nwho  appeared  outwardly  male,  but  who  had  female  genitals.  If,  unlike  Grimm,  this \nhypothetical student had obtained a birth certificate identifying him as male prior to \nenrolling at Gloucester High, then that student would have been able to use the boys’ \nrestrooms under the Board’s current interpretation of its own policy. It is arbitrary that this \nhypothetical transgender student would not be subject to the policy, whereas Grimm would. \nSee Adams By & Through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., No. 18-13592, 2020 WL \n4561817,  at  *5  (11th  Cir.  Aug.  7,  2020)  (“To  pass  muster  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, a governmental gender classification must ‘be reasonable, not arbitrary.’” \n(quoting Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971) (quotation marks omitted)). \nSuch a student would, of course, have female genitals. But genital characteristics \nare immaterial if, as the Board claims, it is solely concerned with the sex marker on a \nstudent’s  birth  certificate.  However,  the  record  shows  that  the  Board  was  not  only \nconcerned with birth certificates below.  \n64 \n \n\nApparently taking issue with the fact that Grimm’s genitals did not match his birth \ncertificate, the Board attempted to extend its sex-assigned-at-birth definition of “biological \ngender” in its summary judgment briefing at the district court. The Board claimed that if a \nstudent were using the restroom associated with the sex listed on their birth certificate, but \nthe  school  learned  that  the  student  had  some  as-yet-unspecified  set  of  anatomical \ncharacteristics of the opposite sex, it would require the student to switch bathrooms on the \nbasis of those physiological differences. \nThe Board wisely abandoned that argument on appeal, given its inability to specify \nwhat set of physiological characteristics suffices to push an individual across its imagined \nline of demarcation between male and female classifications. But its shifting definitions of \n“biological  gender”  suggest  that  the  policy  is  ends-driven  and  motivated  more  by \ndiscomfort with the presence of someone who appeared as a boy (but nonetheless had \nfemale genitals) using the boys’ bathroom than concerns for a person’s designation at birth.  \nB. \nThat suggestion is bolstered by another disturbing inconsistency in the policy: it \nproduces the very privacy harms it purportedly seeks to avoid. Despite appearing wholly \nmale except for his genitals, Grimm could have used the girls’ restroom under the policy. \nFemale students would thus have found themselves in a private situation in front of \nsomeone with the physiology of the opposite biological sex—the exact harm to male \nstudents posited by the Board and my dissenting colleague, Judge Niemeyer. See Niemeyer \nDis. Op. at 88-89, 93. \n65 \n \n\nSpecifically, the Board claims the policy protects the privacy interests of students \nwho do not wish to be exposed to, or in a state of undress in front of, those with physical \ncharacteristics of the opposite sex. That is undoubtedly a long-recognized and important \ngovernment interest, as Judge Niemeyer points out. Niemeyer Dis. Op. at 88-89. But, as \nJudge Floyd notes, the Board can identify no instance of such harms to the privacy interests \nof  its  students—a  result  consistent  with  the  experiences  of  numerous  school  boards \nnationwide. Maj. Op. at 46-48. \nThat  is  unsurprising  because,  as  a  matter  of  common  sense,  any  individual’s \nappropriate use of a public bathroom does not involve exposure to nudity—an observation \nthat is particularly true given the privacy enhancements installed in the bathrooms at \nGloucester High. See Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of \nEduc., 858 F.3d 1034, 1052 (7th Cir. 2017) (“Common sense tells us that the communal \nrestroom is a place where individuals act in a discreet manner to protect their privacy and \nthose who have true privacy concerns are able to utilize a stall.”). \nJudge Niemeyer in dissent suggests that the “mere presence” of someone with \nfemale genitals in a male bathroom would create an untenable intrusion on male privacy \ninterests. Niemeyer Dis. Op. at 89. That assertion is debatable at the least, in the context of \nboth male and female bathrooms. And it echoes the sort of discomfort historically used to \njustify exclusion of Black, gay, and lesbian individuals from equal participation in our \nsociety,  as  discussed  infra.  But  it  is  ultimately  beside  the  point,  because  the  Board \nidentified only three scenarios of concern in which boys would have felt unduly exposed \nto Grimm: when they used the stalls, when they used the urinals, and when they opened \n66 \n \n\ntheir pants to tuck in their shirts. The Board has identified no instances where such exposure \noccurred. \nCrucially,  even  if  were  we  to  accept  the  Board’s  contention  that  the  alleged \ninfringements on student bodily privacy were in fact present, then the policy would, on \nbalance, harm student privacy interests more than it helped them. Unlike his clothed \ngenitals, Grimm’s male characteristics—no breasts, masculine features and voice timbre, \nfacial hair, and a male haircut—would have been readily apparent to any person using the \ngirls’ restroom. Put simply, Grimm’s entire outward physical appearance was male. As \nsuch, there can be no dispute that had he used the girls’ restroom, female students would \nhave suffered a similar, if not greater, intrusion on bodily privacy than that the Board \nascribes to its male students. The Board’s stated privacy interests thus cannot be said to be \nan “exceedingly persuasive” justification of the policy. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. \n515, 532 (1996). \nFurther, if the Board’s concern were truly that individuals might be exposed to those \nwith  differing  physiology,  it  would  presumably  have  policies  in  place  to  address \ndifferences  between  pre-pubescent  and  post-pubescent  students,  as  well  as  intersex \nindividuals who possess some mix of male and female physical sex characteristics and who \ncomprise a greater fraction of the population than transgender individuals. See Whitaker, \n858 F.3d at 1052-53; Br. for Amicus Curiae interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth in \nSupp. of Pl.-Appellee 5 (noting that 2% of all children born worldwide have variations in \nsex organs, chromosomes, and hormones that do not fit within binary anatomical gender \nclassifications); Maj. Op. at 7 (noting that .6% of the United States adult population is \n67 \n \n\ntransgender).  That  the  Board’s  policy  does  not  address  those  circumstances  further \nsuggests  that  its  privacy  justification  is  a  post-hoc  rationalization  based  on  mere \nhypotheticals. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. \nC. \n  One final note. Under the Board’s policy, Grimm should have been able to use the \nboys’ restroom if he had provided an updated birth certificate listing him as male. Of \ncourse, he did just that. But the Board baldly refused to apply its own policy, instead \nassembling a variety of post-hoc administrative justifications for its noncompliance—\njustifications that were ultimately meritless. See Maj. Op. at 30-31. \nII. \nThe above problems notwithstanding, the Board audaciously invites us to ignore the \npolicy’s poorly formulated, arbitrary character, claiming that “[e]very student can use a \nrestroom associated with their physiology, whether they are boys or girls. If students \nchoose not to use the restroom associated with their physiology, they can use a private, \nsingle-stall restroom.” Opening Br. at 44. But that choice is no choice at all because, its \nabove-described  physiological  misunderstandings  and  omissions  aside,  the  Board \ncompletely misses the reality of what it means to be a transgender boy. \nAs Judge Floyd thoroughly notes, historical experience and decades of scientific \ninquiry  have  established  that  transgender  individuals  have  an  innate  conception  of \nthemselves as belonging to one gender. Maj. Op. at 7-14. A transgender person’s awareness \nof themselves as male or female is no less foundational to their essential personhood and \nsense of self than it is for those born with female genitals to identify as female, or for those \n68 \n \n\nborn with male genitals to identify as male. History demonstrates that this self-conception \nis unshakeable indeed.  Transgender  individuals  have  persisted  despite the  significant \nharms  that  arose  from  living  in  societies  that  did  not  recognize  them:  cultural \nmarginalization and disregard at best, and horrific oppression and lethal violence at worst.  \nSo, despite the Board’s contention that there is no problem because Grimm could \nhave used the girls’ bathrooms or the single-stall bathrooms, we must take a careful and \npractical look at the options he realistically faced. Grimm was of course barred from the \nboys’ restrooms because of his Board-defined “biological gender.” And despite the Board’s \nassurances, he effectively could not use the girls’ restrooms. His gender identity has always \nbeen male. He could no more easily use the girls’ restrooms than a cisgender boy.2 The \nBoard pointedly ignores this basic fact.  \nSo, Grimm was effectively left with one option: the single-stall restrooms. But he \ndid not use those restrooms at all because doing so “made [him] feel even more stigmatized \nand isolated than using the nurse’s office” to which he had been previously relegated. \nGavin Grimm Decl. ¶ 47. Specifically, “everyone knew that they were installed for [him] \nin particular, so that other boys would not have to share the same restroom as [him].” Id. \nIndeed, the Board does not controvert Grimm’s assertion that no other students used the \nsingle-stall restrooms.  \n \n2 Grimm had, of course, used girls’ restrooms before his transition. But that fact says \nnothing about the harm he suffered from doing so. Grimm suffered from gender dysphoria \nas a result of living as a girl (including use of girls’ bathrooms) despite identifying as a \nboy.  \n69 \n \n\nThis problem is all too familiar. Forced segregation of restrooms and schools along \nracial lines—a blight on this country’s history—occurred well within living memory. See \nBr. of Amicus Curiae NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc. in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee 7-\n8 (hereinafter “Br. of NAACP”) (describing various laws passed to segregate restroom \nfacilities and schools on the basis of race). Such segregation was infamously justified on \nthe ground that no harm could inhere if separate but equal facilities were provided to \nAfrican American schoolchildren. We now know that to be untrue: it is axiomatic that \ndiscriminating against students on the basis of race “generates a feeling of inferiority as to \ntheir status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever \nto be undone.” Brown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954).  \nI see little distinction between the message sent to Black children denied equal \ntreatment in education under the doctrine of “separate but equal” and transgender children \nrelegated to the “alternative appropriate private facilit[ies]” provided for by the Board’s \npolicy. The import is the same: “the affirmation that the very being of a people is inferior.” \nMartin Luther King, Jr., “The Other America,” Remarks Given at Stanford University \n(Apr. 14, 1967) (transcript available at https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/the-other-\namerica-speech-transcript-martin-luther-king-jr);  see  also  Doe  by  &  through  Doe  v. \nBoyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 530 (3rd Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2636 \n(2019) (holding that a policy forcing transgender students to use separate single-user \nfacilities “would very publicly brand all transgender students with a scarlet ‘T,’ and they \nshould not have to endure that as the price of attending their public school”).  \n70 \n \n\nJudge Niemeyer in dissent notes that Title IX and equal protection permit separate \nbut equal accommodations in schools on a male/female basis. Niemeyer Dis. Op. at 93-94. \nBut  that  observation  says  nothing  about  what  happened  in  this  case:  separation  of \ntransgender students from their cisgender counterparts through a policy that ensures that \ntransgender students may use neither male nor female bathrooms due to the incongruence \nbetween their gender identity and their sex-assigned-at-birth. That segregation generates \nharmful stigma, which was exacerbated in this case by the fact that the facilities were \nseparate, but not even equal—there were no single-stall restrooms at football games, and \nthe single-stall restrooms in the school building were located much farther from Grimm’s \nclasses than the boys’ and girls’ restrooms. \nMoreover, it is important to note that the harm arising from the policy’s message—\nthat transgender students like Grimm should exist only at the margins of society, even when \nit comes to basic necessities like bathrooms—although foreign to the experiences of many, \nis not hypothetical. Nor does the policy merely engender discomfort or embarrassment for \ntransgender students. Instead, the pain is overwhelming, unceasing, and existential. In an \nexperience all too common for transgender individuals (particularly children), early in his \njunior year at Gloucester High, Grimm was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts resulting \nfrom being in an environment of “unbearable” stress where “every single day, five days a \nweek” he felt “unsafe, anxious, and disrespected.” Gavin Grimm Decl. ¶ 54. \nFurthermore,  putting  aside  the  specific  harm  to  Grimm,  the  Board’s  policy \nperpetuates a harmful and false stereotype about transgender individuals; namely, the \n“transgender predator” myth, which claims that students (usually male) will pretend to be \n71 \n \n\ntransgender in order to gain access to the bathrooms of the opposite sex—thus jeopardizing \nstudent safety. Indeed, the policy expresses concern that the presence of transgender \nstudents in school bathrooms endangers students. Although not relied upon by the Board \non appeal, one of the policy’s stated purposes is to “provide a safe learning environment \nfor all students.” J.A. 775. \n The  “transgender  predator”  myth  echoes  similar  arguments  used  to  justify \nsegregation along racial lines. In the 1950s, segregationists spread false rumors that Black \nwomen would spread venereal diseases to toilet seats, and that Black men would sexually \nprey upon white women if public swimming pools were integrated. See Br. of NAACP 13-\n14, 16-17. Although history eventually proved the lie of such claims, the injustice was \nsevere.  \nEven more recently, privacy concerns similar to those championed by the Board \nwere invoked by opponents of gay and lesbian equality. These opponents argued that such \nindividuals, especially gay men, must not be allowed to come into contact with young \nchildren  or adolescents. They justified  such claims by pointing either to a  supposed \nuncontrollable, predatory sexual attraction among gay men toward children, or to an \ninsidious desire to convert young people to an immoral (which is to say, non-heterosexual) \nlifestyle. See id. at 21-22 (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 602 (2003) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (“Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual \nconduct  as  .  .  .  scoutmasters  for  their  children  [or]  as  teachers  in  their  children’s \nschools[.]”)).  \n72 \n \n\nThe  “transgender  predator”  myth—although  often  couched  in  the  language  of \nensuring student privacy and safety—is no less odious, no less unfounded, and no less \nharmful than these race-based or sexual-orientation-based scare tactics. As one of our sister \nCircuits noted during the era of racial segregation: “[t]he law can never afford to bend in \nthis direction again. The Constitution of the United States recognizes that every individual \n. . . is considered equal before the law. As long as this principle is viable, full equality of \neducational opportunity must prevail over theoretical sociological and genetical arguments \nwhich attempt to persuade to the contrary.” Haney v. Cnty. Bd. of Educ. of Sevier Cnty., \n410 F.2d 920, 926 (8th Cir. 1969). \nIII. \n  In sum, the picture that emerges from this case is damning.  \nThe Board drafted a policy so arbitrary that it cannot provide consistent treatment \namong the very individuals it discriminates against. In so doing, the Board pursued shifting \nand ends-driven definitions of “biological gender” that guaranteed a particular outcome: \nthat one student would be unable to use the boys’ restroom. The policy bears an eerie \nsimilarity to stigmatic discrimination in the separate-but-equal context—which produces \ndeeply corrosive, irreversible harm across a human life. Against that injury to Grimm, the \nBoard offers a set of purported privacy injuries that have not occurred, while ignoring \nconcomitant greater harms that would have resulted were Grimm to have followed the \npolicy and used female school restrooms. And most tellingly, when Grimm attempted to \ncomply with the policy by submitting an updated birth certificate, the Board resorted to \nprocedural roadblocks. \n73 \n \n\n   In light of this history, I have little difficulty concluding that the Board’s policy is \northogonal to its stated justifications. Far from ensuring student privacy, it has been applied \nto  marginalize  and  demean  Grimm  for  the  mere  fact  that  he,  like other  transgender \nindividuals, is different from most. Even worse, it did so to a child at school.  \nCommon experience teaches that high school is a challenging environment, in \nwhich every child perceives significant pressure to belong within their peer group while \nalso defining their own personal identity and sense of self. Even the most trivial differences \nfrom others may take on outsized significance to an adolescent. How harrowing it must be \nfor transgender individuals like Grimm to navigate that fraught setting while facing an \nunceasing daily reminder that they are not wanted, and that circumstances for which they \nare blameless render them members of a second class.  \n  Of course, deriding those who are different—whether due to discomfort or dislike—\nis not new. But the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection prohibits the law from \ncountenancing  such  discrimination.  “The  Constitution  cannot  control  such  [private] \nprejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the \nlaw, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.” Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 \nU.S. 429, 433 (1984); see also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 447 \n(1985) (holding that policies enacted with “a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular \ngroup” cannot be upheld under equal protection (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, \n413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973))).  \n  For that reason, I disagree with Judge Niemeyer’s assertion that the panel majority \nattempts to “effect policy rather than simply apply law.” Niemeyer Dis. Op. at 95. That \n74 \n \n\nargument is meritless because “[t]he Nation’s courts are open to injured individuals who \ncome to  them  to  vindicate  their  own  direct, personal  stake in  our  basic  charter.  An \nindividual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if \nthe broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act.” Obergefell v. \nHodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2605 (2015). Ensuring the Constitution’s mandate of equal \nprotection is satisfied for marginalized and minority groups, separate from the “vicissitudes \nof political controversy,” is one of our most vital and solemn duties. Id. at 2606 (quoting \nW. Va. Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943)). \n  Discrimination  like  that  faced  by  Grimm  has  reared  its  ugly  head  throughout \nAmerican history. Yet, for most Americans, time has rendered it an embarrassment to the \nlegacies of the individuals inflicting it. With that observation, I join in the thorough and \nwell-reasoned opinion of my colleague, Judge Floyd. \n75 \n \n\nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \n  Gavin Grimm, a transgender male, commenced this action in 2015 while a student \nattending Gloucester High School in Gloucester, Virginia, to require the school to permit \nhim to use the male restrooms.  The High School provided male restrooms and female \nrestrooms  and,  under  school  policy,  “limited  [those  restrooms]  to  the  corresponding \nbiological  genders.”    It  also  provided  unisex  restrooms  and  made  them  available  to \neveryone,  with  the  particular  goal  of  accommodating  transgender  students.    In  his \ncomplaint, Grimm contended that the High School’s policy discriminated against him \n“based on his gender,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, and “on the basis of sex,” in violation of Title IX.  He sought among other \nthings  injunctive  relief  requiring  the  High  School  “to  allow  [him]  to  use  the  boys’ \nrestrooms at school.”  After graduating from the High School, Grimm filed a second \namended complaint, seeking only declaratory relief and nominal damages. \n  Contrary to Grimm’s claim, Title IX and its regulations explicitly authorize the \npolicy followed by the High School.  While the law prohibits discrimination on the basis \nof sex in the provision of educational benefits, it allows schools to provide “separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, including “toilet, locker room, and \nshower facilities,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Gloucester High School followed these provisions \nprecisely, going yet further by providing unisex restrooms for those not wishing to use the \nrestrooms designated on the basis of sex.  Moreover, in complying with Title IX, which \nGrimm  has  not  challenged  as  unconstitutional,  the  High  School  did  not  deliberately \ndiscriminate against him in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \n76 \n \n\nAmendment.  To the contrary, the High School’s classifications for restroom usage — \nwhich accord with longstanding and widespread practice — were appropriately justified \nby the needs of individual privacy, as has been recognized by law.  At bottom, Gloucester \nHigh School reasonably provided separate restrooms for its male and female students and \naccommodated transgender students by also providing unisex restrooms that any student \ncould use.  The law requires no more of it. \n  The majority opinion, pursuing the public policy that it deems best, rules that \nseparating restrooms on the basis of biological sex is discriminatory.  In doing so, it \noverlooks  altogether and  therefore  does  not  address  the reasons  for  such separation.  \nRather, it blithely orders that the High School allow both transgender males and biological \nmales to use the same restrooms, thus abolishing any separation of restrooms on the basis \nof biological sex.  Indeed, its ruling that male includes transgender males and likewise that \nfemale includes transgender females renders on a larger scale any separation on the basis \nof sex nonsensical.  In effect, the majority opinion does no more than express disagreement \nwith Title IX and its underlying policies, which is not, of course, the role of courts tasked \nwith deciding cases and controversies. \n  I  cast  no  doubt  on  the  genuineness  of  Gavin  Grimm’s  circumstances,  and  I \nempathize with his adverse experiences.  But judicial reasoning must not become an \noutcome-driven enterprise prompted by feelings of sympathy and personal views of the \nbest policy.  The judiciary’s role is simply to construe the law.  And the law, both statutory \nand constitutional, prohibits discrimination only with respect to those who are similarly \nsituated.  Here, Grimm was born a biological female and identifies as a male, and therefore \n77 \n \n\nhis circumstances are different from the circumstances of students who were born as \nbiological males.  For purposes of restroom usage, he was not similarly situated to students \nwho were born as biological males.   \n  Accordingly, I would conclude that Grimm’s complaint failed to state a claim on \nwhich relief can be granted. \n \nI \n \n  At birth, Grimm was identified as female, and there was concededly no ambiguity \nabout his sex.  Thus, when it came time to enroll him in the Gloucester County School \nSystem, Grimm’s parents indicated that he was female.   \n  Beginning at an early age, however, Grimm “saw [himself] as a boy” and “did not \nwant to be perceived as feminine in any way.”  At around the age of 12, he started \npresenting himself as a boy.  He got a traditional male haircut, wore clothing exclusively \nfrom the boys’ section of stores, and eventually began using a compression garment to \nflatten his developing breasts.  Around the time of his 15th birthday, in the spring of 2014, \nGrimm came out to his parents as a transgender boy and, at his request, began therapy with \na psychologist.  His psychologist diagnosed him with “gender dysphoria,” a condition of \nclinically significant distress experienced by some transgender people resulting from the \nincongruence between the gender with which they identify and their sex as identified at \nbirth.  Soon thereafter, Grimm obtained a court order legally changing his name from the \nfemale name he was given at birth to Gavin Elliot Grimm.   \n78 \n \n\nIn advance of his 10th grade year, Grimm and his mother met with a guidance \ncounselor at the High School to explain that Grimm was transgender and intended, as part \nof his treatment for gender dysphoria, to socially transition at school.  Both Grimm and his \nmother found the school counselor to be supportive.  The High School changed its records \nto reflect Grimm’s new name, and Grimm and the school counselor agreed that Grimm \nwould send an email to his teachers explaining that he was to be addressed by his new male \nname and referred to by male pronouns.  Grimm chose to continue completing his physical \neducation classes through an online program so he did not need to use the school’s locker \nrooms.  And with respect to restrooms, he and the school counselor agreed that he could \nuse a private restroom in the nurse’s office. \n  As the school year began, however, Grimm found that using the separate restroom \nwas stigmatizing as well as inconvenient, causing him at times to be late for classes.  After \na few weeks, he expressed his concerns to the Principal and asked for permission to use \nthe male restrooms instead.  The Principal gave Grimm permission to do so.  But within a \nfew days, school officials began receiving complaints from parents, and a student met with \nthe Principal to express his concerns.  These members of the school community felt \nstrongly that allowing a student with female anatomical features to use the male restrooms \nwould infringe on the privacy interests of the male students. \n  In response to this input from the community, the Gloucester County School Board \nconducted public meetings, after which it adopted the following policy: \nWhereas the [Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”)] recognizes that \nsome students question their gender identities, and  \n79 \n \n\nWhereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and \nguidance from parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and  \nWhereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all \nstudents and to protect the privacy of all students, therefore  \nIt shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and \nlocker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be \nlimited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender \nidentity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility.   \nFollowing adoption of the policy, the Principal advised Grimm that he was no longer \npermitted to use the High School’s male restrooms.  And about a week later, the school \ncompleted construction of three single-stall, unisex restrooms that were made available to \nall students.   \n  Grimm felt stigmatized by the new policy and chose not to use the new unisex \nrestrooms.  He also felt uncomfortable using the female restrooms.  As a result, he tried to \navoid the use of restrooms at school, and when he could not avoid doing so, he used the \nrestroom in the nurse’s office.  Nonetheless, he felt that by doing so, he called attention to \nhis transgender status, making him uncomfortable. \n  At  the  end  of  Grimm’s  11th  grade  year,  when  he  was  17  years  old,  Grimm \nunderwent a chest reconstruction surgery as part of his treatment for gender dysphoria.  He \nalso continued hormone therapy, which he had begun more than a year earlier and which \ndeepened his voice, caused him to grow facial hair, and gave him a more masculine \nappearance overall. \n  Near the start of his 12th grade year in 2016, the Gloucester County Circuit Court \ngranted Grimm’s petition for an order directing the State Registrar to amend his birth \n80 \n \n\ncertificate.  Pursuant to that order, the Registrar issued a birth certificate to Grimm that \nlisted his sex as male.  Thereafter, Grimm requested that the High School change the gender \nlisted on his school records to conform to his new birth certificate.  Pursuant to the advice \nof counsel, the School Board advised Grimm that it had decided not to change the official \nschool records.  Grimm graduated from the High School in June 2017. \n*  *  * \n  In June 2015, at the end of his 10th grade year, Grimm commenced this action \nagainst the Gloucester County School Board, alleging that the School Board’s policy of \nassigning students to male and female restrooms based on their biological sex rather than \ntheir gender identity violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.  \nAmong other things, he sought a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the \nSchool Board to allow him to use the male restrooms at the school.   \nThe district court granted the School Board’s motion to dismiss Grimm’s Title IX \nclaim for failure to state a claim, relying primarily on a regulation implementing the statute \nthat  expressly  permits  schools  to  provide  “separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and  shower \nfacilities on the basis of sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  The court also denied Grimm’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.   \n  On appeal from the denial of the injunction, we reversed the district court’s order \nand remanded the case.  See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709 \n(4th Cir. 2016).  We reasoned that the Title IX regulation permitting schools to provide \nseparate restrooms and other similar facilities for male and female students was ambiguous \n81 \n \n\nwith respect to “how a school should determine whether a transgender individual is a male \nor female for the purpose of access to [these] sex-segregated” facilities.  Id. at 720.  We \nthen relied on a guidance document issued by the U.S. Department of Education stating \nthat schools were generally required to “treat transgender students consistent with their \ngender identity,” id. at 718, and concluded that the interpretation was “entitled to Auer \ndeference and . . . controlling weight,” id. at 723.  In addition, we vacated the district court’s \norder denying a preliminary injunction, concluding that the court had used the wrong \nevidentiary standard in evaluating Grimm’s motion.  Id. at 724–26. \n  The School Board filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, as \nwell as a motion for a stay of our judgment.  During the same period, the district court, \nbased on our analysis, granted Grimm’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  The Supreme \nCourt, however, stayed the district court’s preliminary injunction, see 136 S. Ct. 2442 \n(Aug. 3, 2016), and it subsequently granted the School Board’s certiorari petition, see 137 \nS. Ct. 369 (Oct. 28, 2016).   \n  While the case was pending before the Supreme Court, a new Administration \nrescinded the previously issued guidance document regarding transgender students, which \nprompted the Supreme Court to vacate our April 2016 decision and to remand the case to \nus for further consideration.  See 137 S. Ct. 1239 (Mar. 6, 2017).  We, in turn, granted an \nunopposed motion to vacate the district court’s preliminary injunction.  See 853 F.3d 729 \n(4th Cir. 2017).   \nAfter Grimm graduated from high school, he withdrew his request for a preliminary \ninjunction and filed an amended complaint that continued to challenge the legality of the \n82 \n \n\nSchool Board’s restroom policy as applied to transgender students, seeking a permanent \ninjunction, declaratory relief, and nominal damages.  But after the district court requested \nsupplemental briefing regarding mootness in light of Grimm’s graduation, Grimm agreed \nto dismiss his requests for prospective relief.  He argued, however, that his graduation did \nnot moot his challenge to the legality of the School Board’s restroom policy because he \nwas seeking only a retrospective remedy in the form of nominal damages and declaratory \nrelief.  The district court agreed.   \n  Thereafter, in a memorandum opinion and order dated May 22, 2018, the district \ncourt denied the School Board’s motion to dismiss Grimm’s amended complaint for failure \nto state a claim, concluding that Grimm had plausibly alleged that, by excluding him from \nthe set of restrooms that corresponded  to his gender  identity, the School  Board  had \nsubjected him to discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX, and had also \ndiscriminated against him in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Grimm v. Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd., 302 F. Supp. 3d 730 (E.D. Va. 2018).   \n  Roughly nine months later, the district court granted Grimm’s motion to file a \nsecond amended complaint, which, for the first time, alleged that the School Board’s \ndecision not to change the gender listed on Grimm’s school records from female to male \nalso constituted a violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.   \n  After completing discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. \nBy order dated August 9, 2019, the district court granted Grimm’s motion and denied the \nSchool Board’s motion.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 400 F. Supp. 3d 444 (E.D. \nVa. 2019).  For relief, the court (1) entered a declaratory judgment “that the Board’s policy \n83 \n \n\nviolated Mr. Grimm’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment . . . and Title IX . . . on the \nday the policy was first issued and throughout the remainder of his time as a student at \nGloucester High School;” (2) entered a declaratory judgment “that the Board’s refusal to \nupdate Mr. Grimm’s official school transcript to conform to the ‘male’ designation on his \nbirth  certificate  violated  and  continues  to  violate  his  rights  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment . . . and Title IX”; (3) awarded Grimm nominal damages “in the amount of \none  dollar”;  (4)  entered  a  permanent  injunction  “requiring  the  Board  to  update  Mr. \nGrimm’s official school records to conform to the male designation on his updated birth \ncertificate”; and (5) awarded Grimm “reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988.”   \nFrom the district court’s order, the School Board filed this appeal.   \nII \n  At the heart of his claim, Grimm contends that in denying him, as a transgender \nmale, permission to use the male restrooms because those restrooms were designated for \nbiologically male students, Gloucester High School discriminated against him “on the basis \nof sex,” in violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.  This claim does not \nchallenge the High School’s provision of separate restrooms but rather asserts that treating \ntransgender males differently than biological males in permitting access to those restrooms \nconstitutes  illegal  discrimination.    This  argument  thus  rests  on  the  proposition  that \ntransgender males and biological males are similarly situated with respect to using male \nrestrooms.   \n84 \n \n\nThe School Board, however, determined that the physical differences between \ntransgender males and biological males were material with respect to the use of restrooms \nand locker rooms, and accordingly it provided unisex restrooms in addition to its male and \nfemale restrooms to accommodate transgender persons such as Grimm.  In having done so, \nthe School Board maintains that it complied fully with Title IX and its implementing \nregulations, which, while prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in any education \nprogram or activity, nonetheless expressly allow educational institutions receiving federal \nassistance to provide separate restrooms for the different sexes.   \nI agree with the School Board’s position.  Any requirement that schools treat male, \nfemale, and transgender students differently from the way the High School treated them \nwould be a matter for Congress to address.  But, until then, the High School comported \nwith what both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause require.  I begin with Title IX.   \n \nIII \n  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).  But the statute contains several exceptions to its nondiscrimination provision, \none of which specifies that “[n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this \nchapter, nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution \nreceiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nsexes.”  Id. § 1686 (emphasis added).  And the applicable regulations give further detail, \n85 \n \n\npermitting schools to provide “separate housing on the basis of sex,” as long as the housing \nis “[p]roportionate” and “[c]omparable,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.32(b), and “separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” so long as the facilities “provided for \nstudents of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other \nsex,” id. § 106.33.  We must therefore determine what it means to provide separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex in a situation where a student’s gender \nidentity diverges from the sex manifested by the student’s biological characteristics.   \nAs several sources make clear, the term “sex” in this context must be understood as \nreferring to the traditional biological indicators that distinguish a male from a female, not \nthe person’s internal sense of being male or female, or their outward presentation of that \ninternally felt sense. \n  Title IX was enacted in 1972, and its implementing regulations were promulgated \nshortly thereafter.  And during that period of time, virtually every dictionary definition of \n“sex” referred to the physiological distinctions between males and females — particularly \nwith  respect  to  their  reproductive  functions.    See,  e.g.,  The  Random  House  College \nDictionary 1206 (rev. ed. 1980) (“either the male or female division of a species, esp. as \ndifferentiated with reference to the reproductive functions”); Webster’s New Collegiate \nDictionary  1054  (1979)  (“the  sum  of  the  structural,  functional,  and  behavioral \ncharacteristics of living beings that subserve reproduction by two interacting parents and \nthat distinguish males and females”); American Heritage Dictionary 1187 (1976) (“The \nproperty or quality by which organisms are classified according to their reproductive \nfunctions”); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1971) (“the sum of the \n86 \n \n\nmorphological, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserves \nbiparental reproduction with its concomitant genetic segregation and recombination which \nunderlie most evolutionary change . . .”); The American College Dictionary 1109 (1970) \n(“the sum of the anatomical and physiological differences with reference to which the male \nand the female are distinguished . . .”).  Indeed, even today, the word “sex” continues to be \ndefined based on the physiological distinctions between males and females. See, e.g., \nWebster’s New World College Dictionary 1331 (5th ed. 2014) (“either of the two divisions, \nmale or female, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their \nreproductive functions”); The American Heritage Dictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011) (“Either \nof the two divisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms are classified \non the basis of their reproductive organs and functions”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate \nDictionary 1140 (11th ed. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of individuals that occur \nin many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male esp. on the basis \nof their reproductive organs and structures”). \n  Given this uniformity in dictionary definitions, it is no surprise that, in the context \nof interpreting Title VII’s nondiscrimination provision enacted in 1964, the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decision in Bostock v. Clayton County relied on this same understanding of \nthe word “sex.”  To be sure, the Bostock Court determined that its resolution of the parties’ \ndispute did not require it to determine definitely the meaning of the term.  See Bostock, 140 \nS. Ct. 1731, 1739 (2020).  But its analysis proceeded on the assumption that, in 1964, the \nterm sex “referr[ed] only to biological distinctions between male and female” and did not \ninclude “norms concerning gender identity.”  Id.   \n87 \n \n\n  Moreover, that the word “sex” in Title IX refers to biological characteristics, not \ngender identity, becomes all the more plain when one considers the privacy concerns that \nexplain why, in the first place, Title IX and its regulations allow schools to provide separate \nliving facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities “on the basis of sex.”  See \n20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b), 106.33.  To state the obvious, what bathroom, \nlocker room, shower, and living facilities all have in common is that they are places where \npeople are, at some point, in a state of partial or complete undress to engage in matters of \nhighly personal hygiene.  An individual has a legitimate and important interest in bodily \nprivacy that is implicated when his or her nude or partially nude body is exposed to others.  \nAnd  this  privacy  interest  is  significantly  heightened  when  persons  of  the  opposite \nbiological sex are present, as courts have long recognized.  See, e.g., Doe v. Luzerne Cty., \n660 F.3d 169, 176–77 (3d Cir. 2011) (recognizing that an individual has “a constitutionally \nprotected privacy interest in his or her partially clothed body” and that this “reasonable \nexpectation of privacy” exists “particularly while in the presence of members of the \nopposite sex”); Brannum v. Overton Cty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(explaining that “the constitutional right to privacy . . . includes the right to shield one’s \nbody from exposure to viewing by the opposite sex”); Sepulveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d \n1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992) (explaining that “[t]he right to bodily privacy is fundamental” \nand that “common sense, decency, and [state] regulations” require recognizing it in a \nparolee’s right not to be observed by an officer of the opposite sex while producing a urine \nsample); Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir. 1981) (recognizing that, even though \ninmates in prison “surrender many rights of privacy,” their “special sense of privacy in \n88 \n \n\ntheir genitals” should not be violated through exposure unless “reasonably necessary” and \nexplaining that the “involuntary exposure of [genitals] in the presence of people of the \nother sex may be especially demeaning and humiliating”).   Moreover, these  privacy \ninterests are broader than the risks of actual bodily exposure.  They include the intrusion \ncreated by mere presence.  In short, we want to be alone — to have our privacy — when \nwe “shit, shower, shave, shampoo, and shine.” \nIn light of the privacy interests that arise from the physical differences between the \nsexes,  it  has  been  commonplace  and  universally  accepted  —  across  societies  and \nthroughout history — to separate on the basis of sex those public restrooms, locker rooms, \nand shower facilities that are designed to be used by multiple people at a time.  Indeed, \nboth the Supreme Court and our court have previously indicated that it is this type of \nphysiological privacy concern that has led to the establishment of such sex-separated \nfacilities.  See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 550 n.19 (1996) (recognizing \nthat “[p]hysical differences between men and women” are “enduring” and render “the two \nsexes . . . not fungible” and acknowledging, when ordering an all-male Virginia college to \nadmit  female  students,  that  such  a  remedy  “would  undoubtedly  require  alterations \nnecessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex” (cleaned up)); \nFaulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting “society’s undisputed approval \nof separate public rest rooms for men and women based on privacy concerns”). \nIn short, the physical differences between males and females and the resulting need \nfor privacy is what the exceptions in Title IX are all about. \n89 \n \n\n  The issue in this case arises from the fact that Grimm is a transgender male who was \nborn a biological female.  Thus, we must determine in this context what it means to provide \nhim separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex.  Grimm does not \nchallenge the constitutionality of Title IX or the legitimacy of its regulations, nor does he \nchallenge the statute’s underlying policy interests.  He argues simply that because he \nidentifies as male, he must be allowed to use the male restrooms and that denying him that \npermission discriminates against him on the basis of his sex. \n  Grimm’s argument, however, is facially untenable.  While he accepts the fact that \nTitle IX authorizes the separation of restrooms — indeed, he seeks to use the male \nrestrooms so separated from female restrooms — the implementation of his position would \nallow him to use restrooms contrary to the basis for separation.  Gloucester High School \nmaintains  male  restrooms,  female  restrooms, unisex  restrooms, and under  its policy, \nGrimm would be entitled to use either the female or the unisex restrooms.  But requiring \nthe school to allow him, a biological female who identifies as male, to use the male \nrestroom compromises the separation as explicitly authorized by Title IX. \n  Seeking to overcome this logical barrier, the majority maintains that the School \nBoard applied “its own discriminatory notions of what ‘sex’ means.”  Ante at 56.  But the \nSchool Board did no such thing.  In implementing its policy, it relied on the commonly \naccepted definition of the word “sex” as referring to the anatomical and physiological \ndifferences between males and females and concluded that, for purposes of access to its \nsex-separated facilities, Grimm’s sex remained female during the time he was a student at \nGloucester High School. \n90 \n \n\n  Not to  be persuaded,  the majority further states that the regulation permitting \nschools to provide separate toilets on the basis of sex “cannot override the statutory \nprohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Ante at 56.  But strikingly, this \noverlooks the fact that Congress expressly provided in the statute that nothing in its \nprohibition  against  discrimination  “shall  be  construed  to  prohibit”  schools  “from \nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  The \nmajority’s oversight can only be taken as a way to reach conclusions on how schools should \ntreat transgender students, rather than a determination of what the statute requires of them. \n  In short, Gloucester High School did not deny Grimm suitable restrooms.  It created \nthree new unisex restrooms that allowed him, as well as the other students, the privacy \nprotected by separating bathrooms on the basis of sex. \n \nIV \n \n  Grimm also contends that, even if the School Board did not discriminate against \nhim on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX, it discriminated against him in violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  He does so without arguing \nthat Title IX violates the Equal Protection Clause in allowing educational institutions to \nseparate restrooms on the basis of sex. \n  The Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall “deny to any person within \nits jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  As long \nrecognized by the Supreme Court, the Clause is “essentially a direction that all persons \nsimilarly situated should be treated alike.”  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., \n91 \n \n\n473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (emphasis added).  In this manner, the provision “simply keeps \ngovernmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant \nrespects alike.”  Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992) (emphasis added).  As such, a \nplaintiff asserting a violation of the Equal Protection Clause must “demonstrate that he has \nbeen treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and that the unequal \ntreatment  was  the  result  of  intentional  or  purposeful  discrimination.”    Morrison  v. \nGarraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); see also Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam) (noting that the Equal Protection Clause “secure[s] every \nperson within the State’s jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination” \n(cleaned up)).   \n  In general, a state-created classification will be “presumed to be valid and will be \nsustained if [it] is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.”  City of Cleburne, 473 \nU.S. at 440.  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that legislative classifications \nbased on sex “call for a heightened standard of review.”  Id.  Thus, when state actors treat \npeople differently on the basis of sex, they must show “that the challenged classification \nserves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 \n(cleaned up).  “The justification must be genuine,” and it may not “rely on overbroad \ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.”  \nId.  Nonetheless, “[t]o fail to acknowledge even our most basic biological differences . . . \nrisks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it.”  Tuan Anh \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001).   \n92 \n \n\n  Here, Grimm appears to acknowledge that a public school may, consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause, establish one set of restrooms for its male students and another \nset for its female students, as long as the two sets of facilities are comparable — a “separate \nbut equal” arrangement that would obviously be unconstitutional if the factor used to assign \nstudents to restrooms was instead race.  And the reason it is constitutional for a school to \nprovide separate restrooms for its male and female students — but not, for example, to its \nBlack and White students — is because there are biological differences between the two \nsexes that are relevant with respect to restroom use in a way that a person’s skin color is \ndemonstrably not.  As noted above, all individuals possess a privacy interest when using \nrestrooms or other spaces in which they remove clothes and engage in personal hygiene, \nand this privacy interest is heightened when persons of the opposite sex are present.  \nIndeed,  this  privacy  interest  is  heightened  yet  further  when  children  use  communal \nrestrooms and similar spaces, because children, as the School Board notes, “are still \ndeveloping, both emotionally and physically.” \n  It is thus plain that a public school may lawfully establish, consistent with the \nConstitution, separate restrooms for its male and female students in order to protect bodily \nprivacy concerns that arise from the anatomical differences between the two sexes.  In light \nof this rationale, Grimm cannot claim that he was discriminated against when he was \ndenied access to the male restrooms because he was not, in fact, similarly situated to the \nbiologically male students who used those restrooms.  While he no doubt identifies as male \nand also has taken the first steps to transition his body, at all times relevant to the events in \nthis case, he remained anatomically different from males.   Because such anatomical \n93 \n \n\ndifferences are at the root of why communal restrooms are generally separated on the basis \nof sex, I conclude that by adopting a policy pursuant to which Grimm was not permitted to \nuse male student restrooms, the School Board did not “treat[] differently persons who are \nin all relevant respects alike,” Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10 (emphasis added), and therefore \ndid not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  And there is no claim or evidence in the record \nthat Grimm was treated differently from any other transgender student. \n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority imputes to the School Board an \nillegal bias based solely on the decision it made to separate restrooms.  It reasons that “[t]he \noverwhelming thrust of everything in the record . . . is that Grimm was similarly situated \nto other boys” with respect to the use of restroom facilities, and it further asserts that, by \n“privileg[ing] sex-assigned-at-birth over Grimm’s medically confirmed, persistent and \nconsistent gender identify,” the School Board revealed “its own bias.”  Ante at 38–39.  But \nin employing such an analysis, the majority fails to address why it is permissible for schools \nto provide separate restrooms to their male and female students to begin with.  Such \nconsideration  would  have  demonstrated  that  it  was  not  “bias”  for  a  school  to  have \nconcluded that, in assigning a student to either the male or female restrooms, the student’s \nbiological sex was relevant.   \nAt bottom, I conclude that the School Board, in denying Grimm the use of male \nrestrooms, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. \n*  *  * \n \n94 \n \n\n  The  majority  opinion  devotes  over  20  pages  to  its  discussion  of  Grimm’s \ntransgender status, both at a physical and psychological level.  Yet, the mere fact that it felt \nnecessary to do so reveals its effort to effect policy rather than simply apply law. \n  I readily accept the facts of Grimm’s sex status and gender identity and his felt need \nto be treated with dignity.  Affording all persons the respect owed to them by virtue of their \nhumanity is a core value underlying our civil society.  At the same time, our role as a court \nis limited.  We are commissioned to apply the law and must leave it to Congress to \ndetermine policy.  In this instance, the School Board offered its students male and female \nrestrooms, legitimately separating them on the basis of sex.  It also provided safe and \nprivate unisex restrooms that Grimm, along with all other students, could use.  These \nofferings fully complied with both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.   \nAccordingly, I would reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss Grimm’s \ncomplaint.  \n \n95 \n ",

Civil No.4:15.cv-54\nGLOUCESTER COUNTY SCHOOL\nBOARD,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nCurrently pending before this Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amended\nComplaint for Failure to State a Claim, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6). ECF No. 118. For the reasons stated herein, the Court defers ruling on the Motion to\nDismiss insofarasDefendant argues that Plaintiffhas failed tostate aclaim for reliefpursuant to\nRule 12(b)(6). Instead, the parties are directed to file supplemental briefing on the question of\nmootness.\n1. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffGavin Grimm, atransgender male teenager, commenced this action against the\nGloucester County School Board in July 2015, alleging that the School Board's policy of\nassigning students to restrooms based on their biological sex violated Title IX ofthe Education\nAmendments of 1972, 20U.S.C. § 1681(a) and the Equal Protection Clause ofthe Fourteenth\nAmendmentto the United States Constitution. In September2015, anotherjudge of this Court\nissued aMemorandum Opinion and Order that (1) dismissed Grimm's claim under Title IX for\nfailure tostate aclaim, and (2) denied his Motion for aPreliminary Injunction based on alleged\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 2 of 7 PageID# 1170\nviolations of TitleIX andthe Equal Protection Clause. G.G. exrel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty.\nSch.Bd., 132F. Supp.3d 736, 753(E.D.Va.2015).\nAn interlocutory appeal of those decisions followed, which led to an appellate review\nprocess by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States\nSupreme Court that lasted nearly two years. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., No. 15-2056,\nslip op. at5-6 (4th Cir. Aug. 2,2017). Duringthis time, the districtcourt case was re-assignedto\nthe undersigned. In August 2017, the Fourth Circuit was again presented with the parties'\noriginal appeal oftheSeptember2015 Memorandum Opinion and Order. Id. at6.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal, a potential mootness issue arose when Plaintiff\ngraduated high school. On August 2, 2017, the Fourth Circuit issued an Order remanding the\ncase tothis Court for a finding onthe question ofmootness and todevelop a factual record on\nthis issue. Id. at 6-8. This Court ordered the parties to submit a Joint Position Statement\nproposing procedures for developing this factual record and conducting proceedings on remand.\nECFNo. 108.\nIntheir Joint Position Statement, theparties advised thatthey hadfiled a stipulation to\nvoluntarily dismiss the Plaintiff's interlocutory appeal regarding the Preliminary Injunction.\nECF No. 111. Because ofthis, they believed that \"there will be no need for additional fact-\nfinding to determine whether the motion for preliminary injunction has become moot.\" Id.\nInstead, parties suggested that this Court grant PlaintiffsMotion toAmend the Complaint and\nsetaschedule allowing Defendanttofile amotiontodismiss. ECFNos. 109, 111.\nThis Court considered the Joint Position Statement, the record, and the history of the\nlitigation, and granted the Consent Motion, allowing the parties to proceed with briefing in\naccordancewiththeirproposed schedule. ECFNo. 112.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 3 of 7 PageID# 1171\nII. ANALYSIS\nRegardless ofwhether a controversy overtheneedforapreliminary injunction remains,\nthethreshold jurisdictional question of whether Plaintiffs graduation from highschool mooted\nthe entire case remains before this Court. See North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 245-46\n(1971) (\"Mootness is a jurisdictional question because the Court is not empowered to decide\nmoot questions orabstractpropositions.\") (internal citations andquotationmarks omitted).\nDefendant'srecentMotion to Dismissalludesbrieflytothe mootnessissue. SeeECFNo.\n118 at 36. Although not expressly framed as anargument sounding in mootness, Defendant\nquestions whether ajusticiable claim remains after Plaintiffs graduation from high school and\nhis concomitanttransitionfrom studentto alumni status. Id. This questionimplicates whether\n\"an actual controversy\" remains among the parties to this case and is, therefore, a question of\nmootness. SeePreiserv.Newkirk,422 U.S. 395,401-02(1975).\nAlthough Defendant purports to raise the issue under Rule 12(b)(6), generally parties\nmust raise mootness issues bymoving todismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), which permits challenges\non the basis ofsubject-matterjurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The Courtconstrues the\nMotion asone broughtpursuanttoRule 12(b)(1)tothe extent itraises whetherthis case presents\najusticiable controversy. See Mims v. Kemp, 516 F.2d 21, 22 (4th Cir. 1975); see also KCE\nProperties, Inc. v. HolyMackerel, Inc., No. 4:16cv42, 2017 WL 376151, at*2 (E.D. Va. 2017).\nEven if Defendant's Motion to Dismiss did not raise mootness, the Court would raise it sua\nsponte as litigants cannot concede mootness. See Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475\nU.S. 534, 541 (1986). Furthermore, Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 12(h)(3) requires this Court\ntodismisstheactionifit\"determines atany timethatitlacks subject-matterjurisdiction.\"\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 4 of 7 PageID# 1172\nBecause constitutional mootness is a jurisdictional issue, the Court has a \"special\nobligation\" to resolve thequestion satisfactorily andcannot proceed until it is assured thatthis\ncase presents a live controversy. See Bender^ 475 U.S. at541 (holding thatevery federal court\nhas a \"special obligation\" to satisfy itselfof its own jurisdiction, even though theparties are\nprepared to concede it). Accordingly, this Court must first besatisfied that it has jurisdiction\nover this case bymaking adetermination astomootness before itisable toproceed tothemerits\nofthiscase. TheCourtdefersconsiderationofall othermatterspendingsupplementalbriefingin\naccordance with the directives providedherein.\nIII. ISSUES FORSUPPLEMENTALBRIEFING\nParties shall fully briefthe issue ofwhether either ofPlaintiffsclaims are moot, inlight\nof: (1) Plaintiff Gavin Grimm's graduation from Gloucester High School and status as an\nalumnus ofGloucester High School, and (2) the Gloucester School Board's (a) stated school\nbathroom policy and (b) the functional—that is, application/enforcement ofthe school\nbathroom policy to non-students (including, but not limited to, alumni).^ Specifically, the new\nbriefingmustaddress, butisnotlimited to,thefollowing issues:\n(a) Whether the mootness question presented here implicates constitutional or\nprudential mootness, or some combination of both doctrines. See, e.g., S-1 v.\nSpongier, 832 F.2d 294, 297 (4th Cir. 1987) (discussing both constitutional and\nprudential mootness).\n(b) The evidentiary framework applied to Rule 12(b)(1) motions and the burden of\nprooftoestablishmootnessatthisstage intheproceedings.\n' Counsel shallbriefthemootness issuesbeforetheCourtcomprehensively. Arguments fromotherfilings,\nifany,shouldnotbeincorporatedbyreference.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 5 of 7 PageID# 1173\n(c) Whether this case implicates any of the recognized exceptions to the mootness\ndoctrine.\n1. Specifically, theparties should consider whether Defendant's representations\nthattheSchool Boardpolicynolonger applies to Plaintiff(bothasamatterof\nstated policy and asamatter ofenforcement) amounts tovoluntary cessation,\nsee, e.g.. Friends ofthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw EnvironmentalServices (TOC),\nInc., 528 U.S. 167,189-94 (2000);\n2. Ifthese representations amount toavoluntary cessation argument, the parties\nshould address whether Defendant's unsworn statements meet its burden to\nmake it \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not\nreasonably be expected to recur.\" United States v. Concentrated Phosphate\nExportAss% 393U.S. 199, 203(1968).\n(d) Both parties shall summarize and attach evidence that establishes the facts\nunderlyingthe mootness issue, including, butnotlimitedto, the following:\n1. Whetherthe GloucesterSchool Board's bathroom use policy applies to non-\nstudents, including, butnotlimitedto,alumni;\n2. Whether the policy would be enforced as tonon-students, including, but not\nlimited to, alumni;\n3. Ifthe policy isenforcedastonon-students, howitisenforced;\n4. Whetheranyotherpolicy governs non-students' bathroom use;\n5. Whetheranyinformal practice governs non-students' bathroom use;\n^Parties are advised that iffactual disputesarise as tothese questions, the parties must presentevidenceas\ntothesedisputes. SeeinfraSectionIVforguidanceastoadditionaldiscoveryprocedures.\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 6 of 7 PageID# 1174\n6. Whether non-students' bathroom use is managedthrough ad hoc decisions. If\nso:\ni. Who makes those decisions;\nii. On what basisthe decision-makerresolves the issue;\n7. WhetherPlaintiffintendsto visit GloucesterHighSchoolasan alumnus;and\n8. Whether, if Plaintiff visits and uses Gloucester High School's bathrooms,\nwhatpolicies, ifany, applytohim, and how suchpolicies would beenforced.\nIV. BRIEFING PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE\nDefendantshall file itsSupplemental Memorandumno laterthan sixtycalendardays after\nthe date of the entry of this Order. Plaintiff shall file its Response no later than twenty-one\ncalendar days after service ofthe Defendant's Memorandum. Defendant may file a Reply no\nlater than seven calendar days after the service ofthe Response. Briefs shall not exceed thirty-\nfive pages,excludingexhibits.\nBecause the mootness inquiry is jurisdictional in nature and applies to the case as a\nwhole, the parties may wish to request limited jurisdictional discovery. See Careflrst of\nMaryland, Inc. v. Carefirst Pregnancy Centers, Inc., 334 F.3d 390, 402-03 (4th Cir. 2003).\nWhen considering ajurisdictional issue such as mootness, the trial court is not limited to the\npleadings, and \"may consider evidence by affidavit, depositions or live testimony without\nconverting the proceeding toone for summaryjudgment.. .[ujnlike the procedure ina 12(b)(6)\nmotion.\" Adams v. Bain, 697F.2d 1213, 1219 (4thCir. 1982) (citing Mims v. Kemp, 516F.2d\n21, 22 (4th Cir. 1974)). Discovery may beuseful todevelop the factual record upon which the\nmootness issue will be resolved. Before undertaking any jurisdictional discovery, the party\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00054-AWA-DEM   Document 123   Filed 10/26/17   Page 7 of 7 PageID# 1175\nseeking to undertake discovery is ORDERED to file a motion forjurisdictional discovery no\nlaterthanfourteen calendardaysafterthedateoftheentryofthisOrder.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe parties are ORDERED to file supplemental briefing on mootness pursuant to the\ndirectives herein.\nAruling on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State aClaim (ECF No. 118) is\nDEFERRED pending resolution ofthemootness issue.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nArendaCSWrigh't Allen\nUnited States DistrictJudge\nOctober 2017\nNorfolk, Virginia",

Exec. Order No. 12,250, 45 Fed. \nReg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, 1980); 28 C.F.R. 0.51.  DOJ may file federal actions in Title \nIX cases where DOJ provides financial assistance to recipients or where ED refers \na matter to DOJ.  42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 517, the United States \nfiled a Statement of Interest in the district court in this case to protect its interest in \nthe proper interpretation of Title IX and its implementing regulations.  The United \nStates files this brief pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a).       \n  STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES   \nWe address the following question: \nWhether a school district violates Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” when it bars a student from accessing the restrooms that \ncorrespond to his gender identity because he is transgender. \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 11 of 40\n    - 3 - \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n1.  Background \n  A transgender person is someone whose gender identity (i.e., internal sense \nof being male or female) differs from the sex assigned to that person at birth.  \nSomeone who was designated male at birth but identifies as female is a transgender \ngirl or woman; someone who was designated female at birth but identifies as male \nis a transgender boy or man.  Gender dysphoria is a medical diagnosis given to \nindividuals who experience an ongoing “marked difference between” their \n“expressed/experienced gender and the gender others would assign” them.  \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Gender Dysphoria, at 1 (2013), http://dsm5.org/ \ndocuments/gender dysphoria fact sheet.pdf.  \nTo alleviate the psychological stress that this disconnect creates, transgender \nindividuals often undertake some level of gender transition to bring external \nmanifestations of gender into conformity with internal gender identity.  The \nclinical basis for gender transition, and the protocol for transitioning, are well-\nestablished.  Since the 1970s, the World Professional Association for Transgender \nHealth (WPATH), an internationally recognized organization devoted to the study \nand treatment of gender-identity-related issues, has published “Standards of Care,” \nwhich set forth recommendations for the treatment of gender dysphoria and the \nresearch supporting those recommendations.  WPATH, Standards of Care for the \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 12 of 40\n    - 4 - \nHealth of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People (7th ed. \n2012) (WPATH Standards), http://www.wpath.org/uploaded_files/140/files/ \nStandards Of Care, V7 Full Book.pdf. \nA critical stage of gender transition is the “real-life experience,” during \nwhich a transgender person experiences living full-time as the gender to which he \nor she is transitioning.  See O’Donnabhain v. Commissioner, 134 T.C. 34, 38 \n(2010).  This experience necessarily includes using the sex-segregated facilities \n(e.g., restrooms) corresponding with that gender.  See WPATH Standards, at 61 \n(“During this time, patients should present consistently, on a day-to-day basis and \nacross all settings of life, in their desired gender role.”).   \nFor individuals for whom genital surgery is appropriate, the WPATH \nStandards require that they live full-time in their new gender for at least one year.  \nWPATH Standards at 21, 58, 60-61.  Contrary to popular misconception, however, \nthe majority of transgender people do not have genital surgery.  See Jaime M. \nGrant et al., Injustice At Every Turn:  A Report of the National Transgender \nDiscrimination Survey, National Center for Transgender Equality and National \nGay and Lesbian Task Force, at 2, 26 (2011), http://www.thetaskforce.org/ \ndownloads/reports/ntds_full.pdf (NCTE Survey) (survey of 6450 transgender and \ngender non-conforming adults revealed that just 33% of respondents had surgically \ntransitioned).  Determinations about medical care must be made by physicians and \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 13 of 40\n    - 5 - \ntheir patients on an individualized basis.  WPATH Standards at 5, 8-9, 58, 97.  For \nsome, health-related conditions make invasive surgical procedures too risky; for \nothers, the high cost of surgical procedures, which are often excluded from \ninsurance coverage, poses an insurmountable barrier.  See id. at 58.  Moreover, and \nof special salience to the operation of Title IX, sex reassignment surgery is \ngenerally unavailable to transgender children under age 18.  See WPATH \nStandards at 21, 104-106. \n2.  Statement Of Facts \nG.G., a 16-year-old transgender boy, is a junior at Gloucester High School in \nGloucester County, Virginia.  Although G.G. was designated female at birth, in \nApril 2014, a psychologist diagnosed him with gender dysphoria and started him \non a course of treatment, which included a full social gender transition.  JA29.  As \npart of that transition, G.G. legally changed his name to a traditionally male name, \nchanged the gender marker on his driver’s license to male, is referred to by male \npronouns, uses men’s restrooms when not at school, and began hormone treatment, \nwhich has deepened his voice, increased his facial hair, and given him a more \nmasculine appearance.  JA29-30, 60.   \nIn August 2014, at the start of his sophomore year, G.G. and his mother \ninformed Gloucester High School officials about his gender transition and name \nchange.  JA30.  School officials changed his name in his school records and \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 14 of 40\n    - 6 - \ninstructed G.G. to email his teachers to explain his transition and request that they \nrefer to him by his new name and male pronouns.  JA30.  Although G.G. initially \nagreed to use a separate restroom in the nurse’s office, he soon found this option \nstigmatizing and inconvenient, as well as unnecessary, as his teachers and peers \ngenerally respected that he is a boy.  JA30-31.  Accordingly, upon G.G.’s request, \nthe school permitted him to begin using the boys’ restrooms, which he did for \nseven weeks without incident.  JA31.   \nIn November 2014, however, some adults in the community learned that \nG.G. was using the boys’ restroom and demanded that the Gloucester County \nSchool Board (GCSB) bar him from doing so.  JA15.  On December 9, 2014, after \ntwo public meetings, GCSB enacted a policy limiting students to restrooms \ncorresponding to their “biological genders” and requiring students with “gender \nidentity issues” to use “an alternative appropriate private facility.”  JA16. \nThe next day, G.G.’s principal informed him that, due to GCSB’s new \npolicy, he could no longer use the boys’ restroom and would be disciplined if he \nattempted to do so.  JA32.  Although the school subsequently installed three \nunisex, single-stall restrooms,1 G.G. found using these restrooms even more \n                                           \n1  The school also made several privacy-related improvements to its \ncommunal restrooms, including raising the doors and walls around the stalls and \ninstalling partitions between the urinals in the boys’ restrooms.  JA17, 143-144.  \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 15 of 40\n    - 7 - \nstigmatizing than using the nurse’s restroom.  JA32.  Therefore, for the rest of his \nsophomore year, G.G. tried to avoid using the restroom altogether while at school, \nleading him to develop painful urinary tract infections.  JA32-33. \n3.  Procedural History \n \nOn June 11, 2015, G.G. sued GCSB alleging that its policy violated Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause.  JA9-24.  G.G. also filed a motion for a \npreliminary injunction to enjoin GCSB from enforcing the policy and thereby \npermit him to resume using the boys’ restrooms when school started in September.   \nJA25-27.  The United States filed a Statement of Interest in support of G.G.’s \npreliminary injunction motion.  JA4-5.  On July 7, 2015, GCSB filed a motion to \ndismiss G.G.’s complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6).  JA5.   \nAt a July 27, 2015, hearing to address both motions, the court announced \nthat it was dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim based solely on the fact that ED’s Title \nIX regulations permit schools to provide separate boys’ and girls’ restrooms.  \nJA114-116.  The court stated that it would allow G.G.’s equal protection claim to \nproceed but postponed ruling on his preliminary injunction motion.  JA129-131.  \nOn September 4, 2015, the district court denied G.G.’s preliminary \ninjunction motion (JA137-138), and on September 17, 2015, it issued its \nmemorandum opinion (JA139-164).  As to Title IX, the court stated that it need not \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 16 of 40\n    - 8 - \ndecide whether Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination includes transgender \ndiscrimination because, in its view, G.G.’s Title IX claim “is precluded by” 34 \nC.F.R. 106.33, ED’s regulation authorizing sex-segregated restrooms.  JA149.   \nARGUMENT \nWHERE A SCHOOL PROVIDES SEPARATE RESTROOMS FOR BOYS \nAND GIRLS, BARRING A STUDENT FROM THE RESTROOMS THAT \nCORRESPOND TO HIS OR HER GENDER IDENTITY BECAUSE THE \nSTUDENT IS TRANSGENDER CONSTITUTES UNLAWFUL SEX \nDISCRIMINATION UNDER TITLE IX \nA.   GCSB’s Restroom Policy Violates Title IX \n \nTitle IX provides that no person shall “be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity” receiving federal financial assistance “on the basis of sex.”  \n20 U.S.C. 1681(a).  Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Price Waterhouse v. \nHopkins, it is well-established that discrimination on the basis of “sex” is not \nlimited to preferring males over females (or vice versa) but includes differential \ntreatment based on any “sex-based consideration[].”  490 U.S. 228, 242 (1989) \n(plurality).  \nHere, GCSB’s restroom policy denies G.G. a benefit that all of his peers \nenjoy—access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity—because, unlike \nthem, his birth-assigned sex does not align with his gender identity.  The policy \nsubjects G.G. to differential treatment, and the basis for that treatment—the \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 17 of 40\n    - 9 - \ndivergence between his gender identity and what GCSB deemed his “biological \ngender”—is unquestionably a “sex-based consideration[].”  Price Waterhouse, 490 \nU.S. at 242 (plurality).  GCSB’s generalized assertions of safety and privacy \ncannot override Title IX’s guarantee of equal educational opportunity.  \nAccordingly, G.G. established a likelihood of success on his claim that GCSB’s \npolicy violates Title IX.    \n1.  Treating A Transgender Student Differently From Other Students \nBecause He Is Transgender Constitutes Differential Treatment On \nThe Basis Of Sex   \n \nGCSB’s restroom policy denies G.G. a benefit that every other student at his \nschool enjoys:  access to restrooms that are consistent with his or her gender \nidentity.  Whereas the policy permits non-transgender students to use the restrooms \nthat correspond to their gender identity (because their gender identity and \n“biological gender” are aligned), it prohibits G.G. from doing so because, although \nhe identifies and presents as male, the school deems his “biological gender” to be \nfemale.  Indeed, prohibiting G.G. from using the boys’ restrooms was precisely \nGCSB’s purpose in enacting the policy.   \nTreating a student differently from other students because his birth-assigned \nsex diverges from his gender identity constitutes differential treatment “on the \nbasis of sex” under Title IX.  Although federal courts initially construed \nprohibitions on sex discrimination narrowly—as prohibiting only discrimination \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 18 of 40\n    - 10 - \nbased on one’s biological status as male or female, see, e.g., Ulane v. Eastern \nAirlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1084-1085 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. \n1017 (1985)—the Supreme Court “eviscerated” that approach in Price \nWaterhouse.  Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2004).  There, the \nCourt held that an accounting firm violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq., when it denied a female senior manager partnership \nbecause she was considered “macho,” “aggressive,” and not “feminine[]” enough.  \nPrice Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 235 (plurality) (citations omitted).  In doing so, \nPrice Waterhouse rejected the notion that “sex” discrimination occurs only in \nsituations in which an employer prefers a man over a woman (or vice versa); \nrather, a prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses any differential treatment \nbased on a consideration “related to the sex of” the individual.2  Schwenk v. \nHartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1202 (9th Cir. 2000). \nA transgender person’s transgender status is unquestionably related to his \nsex:  indeed, the very definition of being “transgender” is that one’s gender identity \ndoes not match one’s “biological” or birth-assigned sex.  See Glenn v. Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011) (recognizing “a congruence between \n                                           \n2  Although Price Waterhouse arose under Title VII, this court and others \n“look to case law interpreting Title VII  *  *  *  for guidance in evaluating a claim \nbrought under Title IX.”  Jennings v. University of N.C., 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th \nCir.), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 887 (2007); see also JA146. \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 19 of 40\n    - 11 - \ndiscriminating against transgender  *  *  *  individuals and discrimination on the \nbasis of gender-based behavioral norms”); see also Finkle v. Howard Cnty., 12 F. \nSupp. 3d 780, 788 (D. Md. 2014); Rumble v. Fairview Health Servs., No. 14-CV-\n2037, 2015 WL 1197415, at *2 (D. Minn. Mar. 16, 2015).  Thus, discrimination \nagainst a transgender person based on the divergence between his gender identity \nand birth-assigned sex denies that person an opportunity or benefit based on a \nconsideration “related to” sex.  Schwenk, 204 F.3d at 1202.   \nWhether viewed as discrimination based on the divergence between G.G.’s \ngender identity and “biological” sex or discrimination due to gender transition, \nGCSB’s policy “literally discriminat[es] ‘because of . . . sex.’”  Schroer v. \nBillington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 308 (D.D.C. 2008).  As the Schroer court \nexplained, firing an employee because she converts from Christianity to Judaism \n“would be a clear case of discrimination ‘because of religion,’” even if the \nemployer “harbors no bias toward either Christians or Jews but only ‘converts,’” \nbecause “[n]o court would take seriously the notion that ‘converts’ are not covered \nby the statute.”  Id. at 306.  By the same logic, the court concluded, discrimination \nagainst a person because he has “changed” his sex, i.e., he is presenting as a \ndifferent sex from the one he was assigned at birth, would be “a clear case” of \ndiscrimination because of sex.  Ibid.      \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 20 of 40\n    - 12 - \nFollowing the reasoning of Price Waterhouse, Glenn, and Schroer, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has concluded that “intentional \ndiscrimination against a transgender individual because that person is transgender \nis, by definition, discrimination ‘based on . . . sex’” in violation of Title VII.  Macy \nv. Department of Justice, No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995, at *11 (EEOC Apr. \n20, 2012).  Although Macy involved an employer’s refusal to hire a transgender \nindividual, in Lusardi, the EEOC applied Macy’s holding to a claim involving a \nrestriction on a transgender employee’s restroom access akin to the restriction \nGCSB placed on G.G.  As here, it was undisputed that Lusardi’s transgender status \n“was the motivation for [the employer’s] decision to prevent [her] from using the \ncommon women’s restroom.”  Lusardi v.

It may well be that the Congresses that enacted Title VII in 1964 and \nTitle IX in 1972 did not have transgender individuals in mind.  But the same can be \nsaid for other conduct that is now recognized as prohibited sex discrimination \nunder those statutes.  See, e.g., Oncale v.

As the Supreme Court explained in Oncale, “male-on-male sexual \nharassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was \nconcerned with when it enacted Title VII.”  Id. at 79.  Nonetheless, the Court \nemphasized that “statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover \nreasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather \nthan the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”  Ibid.  \nExcluding from the statute’s purview conduct that falls within its plain text simply \nbecause Congress may not have contemplated it “is no longer a tenable approach to \nstatutory construction.”  Schroer, 577 F.

Where A School Provides Sex-Segregated Restrooms, Denying A \nStudent Access To The Restrooms Consistent With His Or Her Gender \nIdentity Denies That Student Equal Educational Opportunity  \n \nJust as “[e]qual access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of \nemployment,” Lusardi, 2015 WL 1607756, at *9, so too is it a basic condition of \nfull and equal participation in a school’s educational programs and activities.  See \n20 U.S.C. 1687(2)(B) (defining “program[s] or activit[ies]” to mean “all of the \noperations” of a school).  Prohibiting a transgender male student from using boys’ \nrestrooms, when other non-transgender male students face no such restriction, \ndeprives him not only of equal educational opportunity but also “of equal status, \nrespect, and dignity.”  Lusardi, 2015 WL 1607756, at *10.   \nUnder GCSB’s policy, G.G. may only use either the girls’ restroom or a \nseparate “unisex” restroom.  That other students may choose to use the unisex \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 23 of 40\n    - 15 - \nrestroom does not change the fact that this policy, which was directed at G.G., not \nonly denies G.G.’s “very identity” as a boy, Lusardi, 2015 WL 1607756, at *10, \nbut also singles him out in a way that is humiliating and stigmatizing.  For \nexample, even when there is a boys’ restroom next to his classroom or locker, G.G. \nmust seek out a unisex restroom in a different part of the school.  See JA32.  In \nplacing this restriction on G.G., GCSB essentially labels him as “other.”          \nThe only other “option” made available to G.G.—using the girls’ restroom \n—is illusory.  It is unrealistic to suggest that a student like G.G., who identifies and \npresents as a boy and whom the school treats as a boy in every other respect, could \nwalk into a girls’ restroom without creating a situation that is disruptive to his \nfemale classmates and humiliating to him.3  Not surprisingly, students put in such \nan untenable position often try to avoid using the restroom all day—putting them at \nrisk for urinary tract infections and other health problems (see JA33)—rather than \nuse a facility that either conflicts with their gender identity or physically and \nsymbolically marks them “as some type of ‘other.’”  JA32.  In other words, \ndenying a transgender boy access to the boys’ restroom is often much more than a \n                                           \n3  Indeed, even before he began masculinizing hormone treatment, G.G.’s \nfemale classmates, perceiving him to be a boy, reacted negatively to his presence \nin the girls’ restroom.  JA32.   \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 24 of 40\n    - 16 - \nmere inconvenience or limitation on his ability to use the restroom—it can be an \neffective denial of a restroom altogether.     \nAs a result of such a policy, transgender students like G.G. are denied the \nability to participate fully in and take advantage of their school’s educational \nprograms.  No one could reasonably expect a student to make it through an entire \nschool day without access to a restroom; any student who attempted to do so would \nlikely experience discomfort and anxiety affecting his ability to concentrate during \nclass, further diminishing his educational experience.  See JA32-33.  And even if a \nstudent could avoid using the restroom during regular school hours, such a \nrestriction would still limit his ability to participate in after-school extracurricular \nactivities that are important to a child’s intellectual, social, and emotional \ndevelopment.4   \nJust as an employee is denied equal employment opportunity if he is denied \naccess to an on-site restroom that co-workers of his same gender may use, see \n                                           \n4  And even if a transgender student were willing to use a unisex restroom, \nthe number and location of such restroom(s) may be such that a transgender \nstudent at a large school would have difficulty reaching the “authorized” restroom \nin the allotted time between classes.  See, e.g., JA32 (G.G.’s affidavit stating that \nonly one of the unisex restrooms is “located anywhere near the restrooms used by \nother students” and that none of the unisex restrooms is “located near [his] \nclasses”).  A student in such situation may feel as though he needed to limit his \nmovement over the course of the day to ensure proximity to an “authorized” \nrestroom, to avoid being late to class or, even worse, having an accident that would \nhumiliate and stigmatize him further. \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 25 of 40\n    - 17 - \nLusardi, 2015 WL 1607756, at *9,5 so too is a student denied equal educational \nopportunity when restrictions of these kinds are placed on his ability to use the \nrestroom.  It is for this reason that the Department of Education—the agency with \nprimary enforcement authority over Title IX—has concluded that, although \nrecipients may provide separate restrooms for boys and girls, when a school does \nso, it must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.  Doing \nso is the only way to ensure that the school’s provision of sex-segregated restrooms \ncomplies with Title IX’s mandate not to subject any student to discrimination on \nthe basis of sex.6       \n                                           \n5  The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) guidelines require agencies to provide employees access \nto adequate sanitary facilities.

General Invocations Of Privacy And Safety Do Not Override Title \nIX’s Prohibition Against Sex Discrimination \n  \nAlthough GCSB claims that its policy “seeks to provide a safe learning \nenvironment for all students and to protect the privacy of all students” (JA142), \nsuch asserted concerns do not justify barring G.G. from accessing the restrooms \nconsistent with his gender identity.  While a school certainly may take steps \ndesigned to ensure the safety of its students, general invocations of “safety” \nprovide no basis for denying a student access to the gender-identity appropriate \nrestroom.  To the extent GCSB claims to be concerned about other students’ \nsafety, it has not provided any factual basis for concluding that G.G.’s use of the \nboys’ restroom poses a safety risk to any student.  A school cannot deny a \ntransgender boy educational opportunities based on a blanket and unfounded \n                                           \n(…continued) \ngender identity, not by the sex assigned at birth.

In many \ncases, a transgender student’s classmates do not even know he is transgender; \nrequiring him to use either a restroom contrary to his gender identity or a separate \nunisex restroom thus functions to “out” him, putting the student at increased risk of \nharm.  See NCTE Survey at 154, p. 4, supra (noting that “outing” a person as \ntransgender “presents the possibility for disrespect, harassment, discrimination or \nviolence”).  Where the student is already “out” publicly—as G.G. was here, largely \ndue to the public hearings putting his transgender status front-and-center—the \nschool can, and should, monitor other students’ treatment of him and put measures \nin place to ensure that he not suffer sex-based harassment in the restroom or \nanywhere else.  See Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 650 (1999) \n(school violates Title IX when it is deliberately indifferent to known student-on-\nstudent sexual harassment).  The appropriate solution, in other words, is to \nmonitor, prevent, and punish the students doing the harassing, not to deny the \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 28 of 40\n    - 20 - \nvulnerable student an equal educational opportunity in the name of protecting \nhim.7    \nLikewise, however commendable an interest in student privacy may be in \nthe abstract, general appeals to “privacy” cannot justify denying transgender \nstudents the right to use gender-identity appropriate restrooms.  With regard to its \nexisting restrooms, a school can take—and, in fact, Gloucester High School has \ntaken—measures to enhance privacy, such as “adding or expanding partitions \nbetween urinals in male restrooms,” and “adding privacy strips to the doors of \nstalls in all restrooms.”  JA17.  If a school wishes to accommodate students who \nare particularly modest, it may create—and, in fact, Gloucester High School has \ncreated—additional single-user restroom options.  JA19.  What it cannot do in the \nname of “privacy” is exclude a male student from the boys’ restroom and require \nhim to use a separate restroom because he was assigned a different sex at birth than \nother boys.  The desire to accommodate other students’ (or their parents’) \ndiscomfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages one class of \nstudents on the basis of sex.  Macy, 2012 WL 1435995, at *10 & n.15; cf. Cruzan \nv. Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 294 F.3d 981, 983-984 (8th Cir. 2002) (dismissing \n                                           \n7  It goes without saying that if a student is being harassed in the restroom \nbecause of his religion or his disability, the appropriate solution is to restrict and \npunish the harasser, not to single out the victim of harassment and require him to \nuse a separate bathroom.              \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 29 of 40\n    - 21 - \nfemale employee’s claim alleging that transgender female co-worker’s use of \nwomen’s restroom created hostile work environment). \nGCSB’s claim that it has “had a long-standing practice” of restricting \nrestroom use by “biological sex” to “respect the safety and privacy of all students” \n(Doc. 32, at 6 (brief in support of motion to dismiss); see also Doc. 46, at 3 (reply \nto appellant’s response to motion to dismiss)), is belied by the fact that it needed to \nenact a formal policy establishing such a restriction.  Indeed, the reality is that, in \nthe context of restrooms outside the home, people generally use the facilities that \nare appropriate for them based on their gender identity and expression; nobody is \nstationed at the door asking for a birth certificate or the results of a chromosome \ntest, or checking to see what genitals the people entering the facility have.  It is \nonly in response to transgender people gaining more visibility that schools and \nother entities have begun to depart from that practice and demand that restroom \naccess be based on “birth” or “biological” sex.  And even then, as this case \nsuggests, employers and educational institutions appear to enforce such bathroom \npolicies predicated on “birth” or “biological” sex against only those individuals \nwho have self-identified as transgender or been outed by others.         \nIn short, although promoting safety and privacy are legitimate goals in the \nabstract, neither of these rationales can justify a policy that denies G.G.—and other \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 30 of 40\n    - 22 - \nstudents like him—not just access to the gender-appropriate restroom but, more \nfundamentally, an equal opportunity at an education.   \nB.   The Department Of Education’s Title IX Regulations Do Not Permit Schools \nTo Enact Discriminatory Restroom Policies Like GCSB’s \n \nContrary to the district court’s conclusion, ED’s Title IX regulations do not \n“preclude[]” G.G.’s Title IX claim.  JA149.  The regulation in question states only \nthat a school “may provide separate toilet  *  *  *  facilities on the basis of sex” \nunder Title IX, as long as the “facilities provided for students of one sex” are \n“comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. \n106.33.  It is silent on the question at issue here:  whether, once a school has \nprovided separate boys’ and girls’ restrooms pursuant to Section 106.33, it may \nprohibit a male student from accessing the boys’ restrooms because he is \ntransgender.8   \nThe district court’s conclusion that Section 106.33 “clearly” permits \nGCSB’s restroom policy (JA152) directly contradicts the interpretation of the \nDepartment of Education—the agency that promulgated the regulation.  ED \n                                           \n8  G.G. does not challenge the existence of male and female restrooms, \nAppellant’s Br. 31, and for good reason.  ED has concluded that the mere act of \nproviding separate restroom facilities for males and females does not violate Title \nIX (as long as the facilities are comparable), see 34 C.F.R. 106.33, which is \nreasonable because such segregation does not disadvantage or stigmatize any \nstudent but simply comports with a historical practice when using multi-user \nrestroom facilities outside the home.  See also Appellant’s Br. 36-37.     \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 31 of 40\n    - 23 - \ninterprets Section 106.33 to mean that recipients may provide separate restrooms \nfor boys and girls.  Section 106.33 does not, in ED’s view, give schools the \nauthority to decide that only those males who were assigned the male sex at birth \ncan use the boys’ restroom.  To the contrary, ED has stated explicitly that although \n“[t]he Department’s Title IX regulations permit schools to provide sex-segregated \nrestrooms,” when a school elects to do so, it “generally must treat transgender \nstudents consistent with their gender identity” so as not to violate Title IX.  JA55 \n(Letter from James A. Ferg-Cadima, OCR Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nPolicy (Jan. 7, 2015)); see also OCR Single-Sex Q&A at 25 (same guidance for \nclasses and activities).9   \nThat interpretation is consistent with how ED has enforced Title IX in this \ncontext.  ED has reached voluntary resolution with two school districts that had \nimposed restrictions on transgender students’ restroom access similar to GCSB’s \npolicy; the agreements provide that those districts will treat transgender students \nconsistent with their gender identity in all aspects of their education, including \n                                           \n9  ED’s guidance does not limit a school’s ability to accommodate a \ntransitioning student’s voluntary request to phase in his access to restrooms of his \nnew gender, as was done here.  Absent such a request, however, schools must treat \na transitioning student consistent with his gender identity. \n   \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 32 of 40\n    - 24 - \ntheir restroom access.10  ED has also, in conjunction with DOJ’s Civil Rights \nDivision, filed two Statements of Interest and the instant amicus brief asserting \nthat, although recipients may provide separate boys’ and girls’ restrooms pursuant \nto Section 106.33, a recipient violates Title IX when it prohibits transgender \nstudents from using restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  See Doc. 38; \nStatement of Interest of the United States, Tooley v. Van Buren Pub. Sch., No. \n2:14-CV-13466 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 20, 2015).  Thus, ED plainly does not interpret \nSection 106.33 to permit schools to enact policies like GCSB’s.  \nWhere there is dispute about the meaning of a regulation, the agency’s \ninterpretation is “controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the \nregulation.”  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  That “deferential standard,” ibid., is certainly met \nhere.11  ED interprets its regulation as clarifying that schools may provide separate \n                                           \n10  Resolution Agreement Between the United States and Downey Unified \nSchool District (Oct. 8, 2014), http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-\nreleases/downey-school-district-agreement.pdf; Resolution Agreement Between \nthe United States and Arcadia Unified School District (July 24, 2013), \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crt/about/edu/documents/arcadiaagree.pdf.   \n \n11  Auer deference is owed to agency interpretations expressed in amicus \nbriefs and Statements of Interest filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 517, see Auer, 519 \nU.S. at 462 (amicus brief); M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 735 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(Statement of Interest), as well as those issued “through an informal process” like \n(continued…) \n \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 33 of 40\n    - 25 - \nrestrooms for boys and girls without running afoul of Title IX.  That is the most \nnatural reading of the regulatory language.  See 34 C.F.R. 106.33 (“A recipient \nmay provide separate toilet  *  *  *  facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities \nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for \nstudents of the other sex.”) (emphasis added).  Because the regulation is silent on \nwhat the phrases “students of one sex” and “students of the other sex” mean in the \ncontext of transgender students, ED has provided guidance on that question.  ED \ninterprets the regulation as requiring schools to treat students consistent with their \ngender identity because doing so ensures that transgender students are not denied \nequal educational opportunity for the reasons described above.  ED’s interpretation \nis a reasonable one, and is thus entitled to deference.  See Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. \nMcCoy, 562 U.S. 195, 207 (2011) (where regulation is silent as to the “crucial \ninterpretive question,” court must look to the agency’s “own interpretation of the \nregulation”); Humanoids Group v. Rogan, 375 F.3d 301, 306 (4th Cir. 2004) \n(deferring to agency interpretation of how its trademark regulation should apply in \nsituation not explicitly addressed by regulation’s language).     \n                                           \n(…continued) \nan “opinion letter,” D.L. v.

Rev. Stat. Ann. Tit. 20-a, \n§ 6501 (2013).  In Doe v. Regional School Unit 26, 86 A.3d 600 (Me. 2014), the \nMaine Supreme Court concluded that this statute “does not mandate, or even \nsuggest, the manner in which transgender students should be permitted to use sex-\nseparated facilities.”  Id. at 605-606.  Thus, the court concluded, an elementary \nschool could not rely on the statute to justify its decision to bar a transgender girl \nfrom the girls’ restroom.  Id. at 606.  As the court explained, although the statute \nrequires schools to provide “separate bathrooms for each sex,” it “does not—and \nschool officials cannot—dictate the use of the bathrooms in a way that \ndiscriminates against students in violation of” the State’s nondiscrimination law.  \nIbid.  ED reasonably reached the same conclusion with regard to 34 C.F.R. 106.33.   \nThe district court’s conclusion that Section 106.33’s plain language supports \nonly the court’s interpretation and therefore “is not ambiguous” (JA152), does not \nwithstand scrutiny.12  The district court’s strained reading—that by using the term \n“on the basis of sex,” Section 106.33 authorizes schools to use whatever sex-based \ncriterion they wish to determine who qualifies as a boy or girl for restroom use—\ndivorces the phrase from the context in which it appears.  In contrast to Title IX’s \n                                           \n12  Whether a regulation is ambiguous is a legal question that this Court \ndetermines de novo.  Humanoids, 375 F.3d at 306.  \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 35 of 40\n    - 27 - \nstatutory language banning sex-based discrimination, the phrase “on the basis of \nsex” in the context of Section 106.33 most naturally refers to the commonplace, \nand long-accepted, practice of providing separate male and female restrooms.  It \nwould be incongruous for the Department of Education, in a regulation \nimplementing Title IX’s antidiscrimination provision, to have given schools free \nrein to use whatever sex-based criterion they want in determining who gets to use \neach restroom.  Certainly a school that has created separate restrooms for boys and \ngirls could not decide that only students who dress, speak, and act sufficiently \nmasculine count as boys entitled to use the boys’ restroom, or that only students \nwho wear dresses, have long hair, and act sufficiently feminine may use the girls’ \nrestroom.  To do so would engage in precisely the sort of sex stereotyping that \nPrice Waterhouse forbids.  Yet, the district court’s interpretation of Section 106.33 \nwould seem to allow just that.  That is not a sensible reading. \nBut even if the district court’s interpretation of Section 106.33 were \nplausible, that does not render ED’s reading incorrect; at most it would mean that \nthe regulation is ambiguous.  This is not a case like Christensen v. Harris County, \nwhich involved a regulation whose plain language precluded the agency’s \ninterpretation.  529 U.S. 576, 587-588 (2000) (regulation’s use of “may” instead of \n“must” made regulation permissive, thus foreclosing agency’s interpretation setting \nforth a mandatory requirement).  Here, Section 106.33’s language does not “clearly \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 36 of 40\n    - 28 - \npreclude[]” ED’s interpretation; indeed, as explained, ED’s interpretation is the \nbest reading of its own regulation.  Humanoids, 375 F.3d at 306.  But to the extent \nthere is any ambiguity, this Court must give “binding deference” to ED’s \nreasonable interpretation of its own regulation.  Kentuckians for the \nCommonwealth, Inc. v. Rivenburgh, 317 F.3d 425, 439 (4th Cir. 2003).      \nThe district court’s suggestion that ED arrived at its interpretation “for the \npurposes of litigation” is inaccurate.  JA153.  ED is “not a party to this case”; it \nadvances its interpretation of Section 106.33, both below and on appeal, as an \namicus curiae, just as the Department of Labor did in Auer.  Chase Bank, 562 U.S. \nat 209.  Thus, its position “is in no sense a ‘post hoc rationalizatio[n]’ advanced by \nan agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack.”  Auer, 519 U.S. at \n462 (quoting Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 212 (1988)).  To \nthe contrary, the interpretation of Section 106.33 that ED advances here “is entirely \nconsistent with its past views,” as expressed in the agreements it has reached with \nschool districts, in its guidance on single-sex activities, in OCR’s 2014 letter, and \nin its Statement of Interest in Tooley.  Chase Bank, 562 U.S. at 210.   \nThe district court’s characterization of ED’s interpretation as “newfound” \n(JA153) is also misplaced.  Section 106.33’s application to the context of \ntransgender students’ restroom access “did not arise until recently.”  Talk Am., Inc. \nv. Michigan Bell Tel. Co., 131 S. Ct. 2254, 2263 (2011) (according Auer deference \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 37 of 40\n    - 29 - \nto agency’s new interpretation of its “longstanding” regulations).  For most of its \nexistence, there was no dispute about Section 106.33’s meaning; it was understood \nsimply to mean what it says, i.e., that Title IX recipients can provide separate boys’ \nand girls’ facilities.  It is only in recent years, as schools have confronted the \nreality that some students’ gender identities do not align with their birth-assigned \nsex, that schools have begun citing Section 106.33 as justification for enacting new \npolicies restricting transgender students to facilities based on their “birth” or \n“biological” sex.  It is to those “newfound” policies that ED’s interpretation of the \nregulation responds.  Providing guidance on how its regulations apply in new \ncontexts is precisely the role of a federal agency.      \nED has reasonably concluded that, although Section 106.33 permits schools \nto provide separate boys’ and girls’ restrooms, when a school elects to do so, it \nmust permit students to use the restrooms that are consistent with their gender \nidentity.  Because ED’s interpretation of its own regulation controls, the district \ncourt erred in dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim on the ground that Section 106.33 \nauthorizes GCSB’s restroom policy.                \n\nAppeal: 15-2056      Doc: 25-1            Filed: 10/28/2015      Pg: 38 of 40\n    - 30 - \nCONCLUSION \n   GCSB’s restroom policy singles G.G. out and treats him differently from all \nother students because the sex he was assigned at birth does not align with his \ngender identity.  Because that policy is “literally discrimination ‘because of . . . \nsex,’” Schroer, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 308, G.G. established a likelihood of success on \nhis Title IX claim, and the district court thus erred in dismissing it.    \n               \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJAMES COLE, JR.

Under  this  Court’s \ncases,  if  Congress  wishes  to  impose  conditions  on \nStates  in  exchange  for  federal  funds,  it  must \nunambiguously  express  those  requirements  in  the \nstatutory language, such that States would not be \nsurprised  by  their  obligations.  But  as  both \nRespondent  and  the  court  of  appeals  have \nacknowledged, the view that Title IX requires States \nto permit access to sex-separated facilities based on \ngender  identity  is  indisputably  “new”  and  “novel.” \nApp. 23a; BIO 22, 31.  \nFor more than forty years, States have accepted \nfederal education funding on the understanding that \nTitle  IX  left  to  them  and  local  school  boards  the \ndiscretion to determine that the physical differences \nbetween  males  and  females  warrant  separate \nrestroom facilities.1 Title IX provides that “nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any \neducational  institution  receiving  funds  .  .  .  from \nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different \n                                            \n1 Amici are the States of West Virginia, Alabama, Arizona, \nArkansas,  Georgia,  Idaho,  Kansas,  Louisiana,  Michigan, \nMississippi,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Ohio,  Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and \nWisconsin and the Governors of Kentucky and Maine. Pursuant \nto Supreme Court Rule 37, the parties consent to the filing of \nthis brief. This brief was authored and funded entirely by amici \ncuriae and their counsel.  \n \n\n2 \nsexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, including “separate toilet, \nlocker  room,  and  shower  facilities  on  the  basis  of \nsex,” so long as the facilities are  “comparable,” 34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.33.  When  the  statute  was  passed  in \n1972, the term “sex” was widely understood to refer \nto the physiological distinctions between males and \nfemales. Pet. Br. 7–9, 26–34.  \nDisrupting  this  settled  understanding,  the \nDepartment issued an unpublished opinion letter in \n2015—in  the  context  of  this  very  dispute—that \nintroduced a new Title IX obligation on the States. \nThe  Department  claimed  that  Title  IX  makes  it \ndiscriminatory for  a  school  to  separate  male  and \nfemale bathrooms, unless each student is allowed to \nselect  either  bathroom  in  accordance  with  that \nstudent’s gender identity. Compounding that error, \nthe  court  of  appeals  below  afforded  this  informal \nopinion  letter  controlling  deference  under  this \nCourt’s  decision  in Auer v. Robbins,  519  U.S.  452 \n(1997). \nAs recipients of grants subject to Title IX, and as \nthe home to political subdivisions that receive grants \nsubject  to  Title  IX,  amici  States  have  direct \ninstitutional and economic interests in enforcing the \nSpending Clause’s structural limits on federal power. \nUnder the Respondent and Department’s newfound \ncondition, States would be forced either to relinquish \ncontrol  over  policies  designed  to  protect  student \nprivacy and safety or else forfeit their entire share of \n$55.8 billion in annual federal school funds.2 Thus, \n                                            \n2 For a list of state laws affecting the local management of \nschools that would need to be modified or abandoned in light of \nthe new interpretation of Title IX, see App. 194a–197a n.8; \n \n \n\n3 \nwhen the Department attempted to apply its novel \nview  of  Title  IX  even  more  broadly  in  a  guidance \nletter issued after the decision of the court of appeals \nin this case, many States challenged the position and \nobtained an injunction.3   \nMore  generally,  the  decision  in  this  case  will \nhave consequences for all Spending Clause regimes. \nIf  the  federal  government  may  change  States’ \nobligations decades after they first agree to receive \nfunds, the federal government will have the power to \nleverage  the  States’  longstanding  reliance  on  such \nfunds  into  accepting  any  number  of  conditions. \nUnder the decision below, little would prevent the \nfederal government from imposing novel conditions \non the States in a variety of other contexts.  \nThe decisions must be reversed. \n                                                                                          \nStates PI Mot., Texas v.

United States, slip op., No. 7:16-cv-054 at *4 (N.D. Tex. \nOct. 18, 2016).  \n \n \n\n4 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Invoking its power under the Spending Clause, \nCongress  enacted  Title  IX  in  1972  to  further  the \nimportant public policy of eradicating discrimination \nagainst women in higher education. In exchange for \nStates’  agreement  to  abide  by  Title  IX’s  anti-\ndiscrimination  mandate  and  waive  their  sovereign \nimmunity  from  suit  for  non-compliance,  Congress \noffered  States  federal  financial  assistance  for \neducation programs. \nCongress’s power under the Spending Clause has \nlimits,  however,  including  that  Congress  must \nclearly indicate in its statute any conditions on the \nStates’ acceptance of federal funds. Neither Congress \nnor any agency charged with administering Title IX \ncan threaten the States with loss of  federal funds \nsimply because it believes the States to have acted in \na manner inconsistent with the statute. Rather, the \nStates’  obligations  are  limited  to  those \n“unambiguously” set forth on the face of the statute. \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman,  451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \nThis  clear-statement  requirement  furthers \nimportant federalism principles. It ensures that the \nStates’ representatives in Congress, particularly in \nthe  Senate,  deliberate  and  resolve  the  specific \nconditions at issue before imposing national policy on \nthe States. It also ensures that States have full and \nfair  notice  of  their  obligations  before  they  decide \nwhether  to  accept  federal  funds  and  subject \nthemselves to suit.   \nIn this case, the statute not only lacks a clear \nstatement  supporting  the  Respondent  and \n \n \n\n5 \nDepartment’s view, it unambiguously forecloses that \ninterpretation. As Petitioner explains at length (Pet. \nBr.  26–41),  Title  IX  expressly  permits  States  and \nschools  to  separate  students  into  different  living \nfacilities based on “sex,” a term widely understood \nwhen  Title  IX  was  enacted  as  referring  to  the \nphysiological distinction between males and females.  \nBut even if there were some debate on this point, \nthis  Court  need  not  definitively  resolve  it.  It  is \nenough  that  the  States  did  not  have  clear, \nunmistakable notice that they would be required to \npermit students to access restrooms based on their \ngender  identity.  The  court  of  appeals  and \nRespondent  have  both  acknowledged  that  this \ninterpretation is “novel.” Supra p.1.  \nThat  alone  requires  reversing  the  decisions \nbelow.  This  Court’s  cases  make  clear  that  States \ncannot be required to comply with obligations they \ncould  not  anticipate  from  the  enacted  statutory \nlanguage. Moreover, to allow such a post hoc change \nto States’ obligations would also violate the Spending \nClause’s prohibition on undue coercion by the federal \ngovernment. Given the billions of dollars of federal \neducation funding on which States have long relied, \nStates would not have any real choice but to accept \nthe Department’s new command. \nII.  Respondent  cannot  avoid  the  Spending \nClause’s  clear-statement  requirement  by  claiming \ndeference for the Department’s faulty view of Title IX \nand its regulations.  \nThe deference principles in Auer v. Robbins, 519 \nU.S.  452  (1997),  fundamentally  conflict  with  the \n \n \n\n6 \nSpending Clause’s clear-statement requirement. On \none  hand  is  a  judge-made  theory  that  affords \ncontrolling weight to an agency’s interpretation of an \nambiguous regulation. On the other, the Constitution \nrequires  Congress  to  speak  explicitly  when  it \nimposes grant conditions and alters the traditional \nbalance  of  power  between  the  federal  government \nand the States.  \nIn this clash between interpretive principles, the \nConstitution  must  prevail.  The  doctrine  of Auer \ndeference should not apply to statutes enacted under \nthe  Spending  Clause.  That  is  particularly  true \nwhere, as here, the Department seeks to place new \ngrant  conditions  on  the  States  via  an  informal \nopinion letter that it did not even properly subject to \npublic notice and comment.  \nARGUMENT \nThis Court granted review in this case to decide \ntwo questions: (1) whether Auer deference is due to \nthe  Department’s  informal  view  that  Title  IX \nrequires schools to open their restrooms to students \non the basis of gender identity; and (2) regardless of \ndeference, whether Respondent and the Department \nhave  correctly  interpreted  Title  IX  and  its \nregulations.  \nLike Petitioner, amici States have reversed the \norder of these two questions in this brief. Part I of \nthis  brief  explains  that  the  Spending  Clause \nprohibits the new condition that Respondent and the \nDepartment seek to read into Title IX. Part II shows \nwhy  this  Court’s  Spending  Clause  jurisprudence \nleaves no room for Auer deference. There are logical \nand  practical  reasons  for  the  reversed  order,  as \n \n \n\n7 \nPetitioner  explains.  At  a  minimum,  the  reversal \nreflects  the  reality  that  a  new  Administration \nassumes  office  in  ten  days.  That  Administration \ncould take actions that affect the deference question \nbut  not  the  controversy  between  Petitioner  and \nRespondent over the interpretation of the word “sex,” \nwhich this Court  has determined  is independently \nworthy of review and has consequences for numerous \npending cases involving the States in federal court.4  \nI.  The  Spending  Clause  Prohibits  The  New \nCondition  That  Respondents  and  The \nDepartment Seek To Read Into Title IX. \nPetitioner correctly explains at length why this \nCourt  should  interpret  Title  IX,  applying  general \nprinciples  of  statutory  construction,  as  allowing \nStates  to  provide  separate  restroom  facilities  to \nstudents based on physiological sex. Pet. Br. 24–41. \nAmici  States  concur  with  Petitioner’s  textual \nanalysis and adopt it herein by reference.  \nBut even if there were some ambiguity on this \npoint,  there  is  no  doubt  that  States  cannot  be \n                                            \n4 See, e.g., Carcaño v. McCrory,  No.  1:16-cv-236,  2016  WL \n4508192 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 26, 2016), appeal pending, No. 16-1989 \n(4th  Cir.); Students & Parents for Privacy v.

Sept.  22,  2016); Privacy \nMatters v. United States,  No.  16-cv-03015  (D.  Minn.)  (filed \nSept.  7,  2016);  Women’s Liberation Front v. U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice,  1:16-cv-915  (D.N.M.)

(filed Sept. 5, 2014); see also supra p.3 n.3 (listing \nadditional State-initiated cases).  \n \n \n\n8 \nrequired to comply with the new condition advanced \nby Respondent and the Department. The Spending \nClause to the U.S. Constitution precludes the federal \ngovernment from imposing an obligation on States, \nas  a  condition  of  receipt  of  federal  funds,  that \nCongress  did  not  make  clear  in  the  statutory \nlanguage.  Pennhurst  State  Sch.  &  Hosp.  v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 24–25 (1981). This clear-\nstatement rule bars the newfound view that Title IX \nrequires  States  to  permit  a  student  to  choose  a \nrestroom  consistent  with  the  student’s  gender \nidentity. \nA.  Congress Must Provide Adequate Notice Of \nAll Conditions Attached To Federal Funds In \nThe Text Of A Statute Enacted Under The \nSpending Clause. \nTo protect the residual sovereignty of the States \nthat  the  Framers  deemed  essential  to  our  federal \nsystem, this Court has required that any conditions \nimposed on States pursuant to the Spending Clause \nbe clearly and unmistakably stated. \n1.  Reflecting  their  concern  with  protecting  the \nStates’ residual sovereignty from federal intrusion, \nthe Framers included several structural safeguards \nin the Constitution. As James Wilson explained, “‘it \nwas a favorite object in the Convention’ to provide for \nthe  security  of  the  States  against  federal \nencroachment and . . . the structure of the federal \ngovernment  itself  served  that  end.” Garcia v. San \nAntonio Metro. Transit Auth.,  469  U.S.  528,  551 \n(1985)  (quoting  2  Debates  in  the  Several  State \nConventions  on  the  Adoption  of  the  Federal \nConstitution 438–39 (J. Elliot 2d. ed. 1876)). Thus, \n \n \n\n9 \n“the preservation of the States, and the maintenance \nof their governments, are as much within the design \nand care of the Constitution as the preservation of \nthe . . . National government.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n501 U.S. 452, 457 (1991) (quoting Texas v. White, 7 \nWall. 700, 725 (1869)).  \nNumerous  safeguards  are  found  in  Article  I \nalone. Foremost, Article I protects state control over \nlocal  matters  by  limiting  Congress’s  authority  to \nspecified,  enumerated  powers. Garcia,  469  U.S.  at \n550.  Article  I  also  requires  each  bill  to  win  the \napproval of the Senate, “where each State receive[s] \nequal representation.” Id. at 551. This allows a group \nof Senators who represent a majority of the States, \nbut only a minority of the population, to block federal \naction  by  rejecting  or  refusing  to  vote  on  federal \nlegislation and appropriations.5 And Article I further \nrequires each law to win the approval of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President (or the override of \na  Presidential  veto),  which  prevents  the  federal \ngovernment from displacing any state law without \nthe agreement of those who represent at least half \nthe States. U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 3.  \nCritically,  in  protecting  the  States,  these \nstructural principles serve to “protect the individual \nas well.” Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 \n(2011). By providing protections for the sovereignty \nof the States, the Constitution secures “‘the liberties \nthat  derive’”  to  individual  citizens  “‘from  the \ndiffusion of sovereign power.’” New York v. United \n                                            \n5 Herbert Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: \nThe Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the \nNational Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543, 547–48 (1954). \n \n \n\n10 \nStates, 505 U.S. 144, 181 (1992) (internal quotation \nomitted). As James Madison explained, by dividing \npower “between two distinct governments, and then \nthe  portion  allotted  to  each  subdivided  among \ndistinct  and  separate  departments,”  “a  double \nsecurity  arises  to  the  rights  of  the  people”:  the \n“different governments will control each other, at the \nsame  time  that  each  will  be  controlled  by  itself.” \nGarcia, 469 U.S. at 582 (quoting The Federalist No. \n51  (James  Madison)).  “Just  as  the  separation  and \nindependence  of  the  coordinate  branches  of  the \nFederal  Government  serve  to  prevent  the \naccumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a \nhealthy balance of power between the States and the \nFederal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny \nand abuse from either front.” Gregory, 501 U.S. at \n458.  \n2.  Given  the  constitutional  imperative  to \npreserve the balance of power between the federal \ngovernment  and  the  States,  this  Court  has  long \ninterpreted federal statutes “against the backdrop” of \nthe federal-state relationship. Bond v. United States, \n134 S. Ct. 2077, 2088 (2014) (citation omitted). This \nCourt  presumes,  as  “a  time-honored  rule,”6  that \nCongress  will  enact  statutes  “consistent  with \nprinciples  of  federalism  inherent  in  our \nconstitutional structure,” absent a plain statement to \nthe contrary, Bond, 134 S. Ct. at 2088. Put another \nway,  this  Court  has  long  required  that  it  be \n                                            \n6 Amy Coney Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, \n90  B.U.  L.  Rev.  109,  143–150,  173  (2010)  (cataloguing  the \nhistory  of  the  canon  requiring  a  clear  statement  before \ninterpreting  a  federal  law  to  override  state  sovereign \nimmunity).  \n \n \n\n11 \n“absolutely  certain,” Gregory v. Ashcroft,  501  U.S. \n452,  464  (1991),  before  it  will  find  that  Congress \ndisplaced the States in any particular case.  \nThis approach ensures that Congress “has in fact \nfaced,  and  intended  to  bring  into  issue,”  the \nparticular  disruption  of  State  authority  at  issue. \nUnited States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971). As \nthis Court has explained, if courts instead were to \n“‘give  the  state-displacing  weight  of  federal  law to \nmere congressional ambiguity,’” there would be every \nincentive for Congress to “‘evade the [constitutional] \nprocedure[s]  for  lawmaking  [that]  protect  states’ \ninterests.”  Gregory,  501  U.S.  at  464  (quoting  L. \nTribe, American Constitutional Law § 6-25, p. 480 \n(2d  ed.  1988)).  If  Congress  were  not  required  to \nexplain  clearly  its  intent  to  displace  or  bind  the \nStates, its members would invariably “pass the buck \nto  the  agencies  with  vaguely  worded  statutes,” \nwhenever “hard decisions ha[d] to be made.”7 After \nall, on “most hard issues our representatives quite \nshrewdly  prefer  not  to  have  to  stand  up  and  be \ncounted  but  rather  to  let  some  executive-branch \nbureaucrat, or perhaps some independent regulatory \ncommission, ‘take the inevitable political heat.’”8 \n3. This presumption has manifested in the form \nof  several  clear-statement  rules  of  statutory \ninterpretation. For example, to displace a traditional \nsphere  of  state  authority  or  preempt  state  law, \nCongress  “must  make  its  intention  to  do  so \n                                            \n7 122 Cong. Rec. H10,685 (daily ed. Sept. 21, 1976) (statement \nof  Rep.  Levitas)  quoted  in  John  Hart  Ely,  Democracy  and \nDistrust: A Theory of Judicial Review 131–32 (1980) \n8 Ely, supra n. 7 at 131–32.  \n \n \n\n12 \n‘unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.’” \nGregory, 501 U.S. at 460 (citation omitted). Without \na “clear and manifest” statement, this Court will not \nread a statute to preempt “the historic police powers \nof the States,” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 \nU.S.  218,  230  (1947),  or  to  permit  an  agency  to \nregulate  a  matter  in  “areas  of  traditional  state \nresponsibility,” Bond, 134 S. Ct. at 2089.   \nSimilarly,  to  abrogate  the  States’  historic \nimmunity from suit, Congress must state its intent \n“expressly  and  unequivocally  in  the  text  of  the \nrelevant statute.” Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, \n290–91 (2011). Congress has the power to abrogate \nstate  sovereign  immunity  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  as  well  as  the  power  to  make  the \nStates’ waiver of sovereign immunity a condition to \nreceipt of federal funds. But before this Court will \nfind that Congress has done so, it will ask whether \nCongress has made abundantly clear its intent to do \nso. Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, \n242 (1985). \nRelevant  here,  a  clear-statement  requirement \nalso applies to statutes enacted under the Spending \nClause. To ensure that the federal government does \nnot use federal funds to coerce States into carrying \nout federal policy, this Court has treated Spending \nClause statutes “much in the nature of a contract: in \nreturn for federal funds, the States agree to comply \nwith federally imposed conditions.” Pennhurst State \nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). \nThis puts an important limit on Congress’s power, by \nrequiring that “the State voluntarily and knowingly \naccepts the terms of the ‘contract.’” Ibid. And there \ncan “be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware \n \n \n\n13 \nof the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is \nexpected of it,” unless Congress speaks clearly. Ibid.  \nThe “crucial inquiry” for a court interpreting a \nspending  statute,  therefore,  is  “whether  Congress \nspoke so clearly that [the court] can fairly say that \nthe State could make an informed choice.” Id. at 25. \nCongress  may  not  “surpris[e]  participating  States \nwith post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Ibid. \n“[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the \ngrant  of  federal  moneys,”  it  “must  do  so \nunambiguously”—and not leave a State’s obligations \nunder the Act indeterminate. Id. at 17. This is “a \nparticularly  strict  standard.”  Port Auth. Trans-\nHudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 305 (1990) \n(citations  omitted).  As  a  result,  courts  “must \ninterpret  Spending  Clause  legislation  narrowly,  in \norder to avoid saddling the States with obligations \nthat they did not anticipate.” Cedar Rapids Cmty. \nSch. Dist. v. Garret F. ex rel. Charlene F., 526 U.S. \n66, 84 (1999) (Thomas & Kennedy, JJ., dissenting).  \nIn  setting  forth  a  condition,  the  statutory  text \nmust be clear at the time of enactment. As this Court \nhas  said,  the  law  must  be  viewed  “from  the \nperspective of a state official who is engaged in the \nprocess of deciding whether the State should accept \n[the] funds and the obligations that go with those \nfunds.” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \nMurphy,  548  U.S.  291,  296  (2006).  Following  this \nCourt’s settled rules of statutory interpretation, such \nan official would discern those obligations based on \nthe meaning of the statutory language at the time \nCongress passed the law. See Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 \nU.S. 379, 388 (2009) (“We begin with the ordinary \nmeaning of the word ‘now,’ as understood when the \n \n \n\n14 \nIRA  was  enacted”); Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp. \nPrograms, Dep’t of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, \n512  U.S.  267,  272  (1994)  (“[W]e  must  seek  to \nascertain the ordinary meaning of ‘burden of proof’ in \n1946,  the  year  the  APA  was  enacted.”); Perrin v. \nUnited States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979) (“[W]e look to \nthe  ordinary  meaning  of  the  term  ‘bribery’  at  the \ntime Congress enacted the statute in 1961”).  \nB.   Title IX Does Not Provide Sufficiently Clear \nNotice  That  States  Must  Give  Students \nRestroom  Access  Consistent  With  Their \nGender Identity. \n1. This Court has “repeatedly treated Title IX as \nlegislation enacted pursuant to Congress’ authority \nunder  the  Spending  Clause.”  Davis Next Friend \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. \n629, 640 (1999). Title IX intrudes on an “area[] of \ntraditional state responsibility,” Bond, 134 S. Ct. at \n2089,  namely  the  control  of  schools,  which  is \n“perhaps the most important function of state and \nlocal governments,” Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 309 \n(1988)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Indeed, \n“[n]o  single  tradition  in  public  education  is  more \ndeeply rooted than local control over the operation of \nschools.”  Milliken v. Bradley,  418  U.S.  717,  741 \n(1974). Under Congress’s Spending Power, Title IX \ndisplaces  this  traditional  state  authority  by \nconditioning “an offer of federal funding on a promise \nby the recipient not to discriminate.” Gebser v. Lago \nVista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 286 (1998).  \nAccordingly,  state  obligations  under  Title  IX \nmust  be  unambiguously  set  forth  in  the  statute. \nBecause  it  is  a  Spending  Clause  statute,  grant \n \n \n\n15 \nrecipients subject to Title IX are only responsible for \nconditions  expressed  in  the  “clear  terms”  of  the \nstatute  itself,  Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. \nMonroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 642 (1999). \nIn addition, because the statute intrudes on an area \n“where  States  historically  have  been  sovereign,” \nUnited States v. Lopez,  514  U.S.  549,  564  (1995), \nCongress  must  speak  clearly  where  it  seeks  to \nregulate. \nThis Court’s Title IX cases are consistent with \nthis  requirement.  For  example,  in  North Haven \nBoard of Education v. Bell, this  Court  considered \nwhether  Title  IX  “prohibit[s]  federally  funded \neducation programs from discriminating on the basis \nof gender with respect to employment.” 456 U.S. 512, \n514  (1982).  This  Court  held  that  Title  IX  does \nprohibit  employment  discrimination  because \n“[e]mployees  who  directly  participate  in  federal \nprograms or who directly benefit from federal grants, \nloans, or contracts clearly fall within the first two \nprotective categories described in § 901(a).” Id. at 520 \n(emphasis added). This Court went on to find that \nthe legislative history, among other things, “confirms \nCongress’ desire to ban employment discrimination \nin  federally  financed  education  programs.”  Id.  at \n530–31. \nSimilarly, even in a line of cases concerning the \nscope  of  the  implied  private  right  of  action  under \nTitle IX, this Court has consistently acknowledged \nthe requirement that States have clear notice of the \nscope of their liability. Because the cases concerned \nan implied private  right  of  action  found  in  a  pre-\nPennhurst  case, Cannon v. University of Chicago, \n441  U.S.  677,  717  (1979),  which  this  Court  has \n \n \n\n16 \ndeclined to reconsider, this Court could not demand \nclarity  from  any  particular  statutory  terms.  See \nGebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, \n285  (1998)  (“Because  Congress  did  not  expressly \ncreate a private right of action under Title IX, the \nstatutory text does not shed light on Congress’ intent \nwith  respect  to  the  scope  of  available  remedies.”). \nNevertheless,  this  Court  has  repeatedly  reiterated \nthat “Title IX’s contractual nature has implications \nfor  our  construction  of  the  scope  of  available \nremedies.” Id. at 287; see also Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 \n(“Because  we  have  repeatedly  treated  Title  IX  as \nlegislation enacted pursuant to Congress’ authority \nunder  the  Spending  Clause,  .  .  .  private  damages \nactions are available only where recipients of federal \nfunding had adequate notice that they could be liable \nfor the conduct at issue.”). \nThus,  in  Gebser, this  Court  held  that  private \nsuits  based  on  the  implied  right  of  action  cannot \nimpose monetary liability for sexual harassment by a \nteacher  unless  the  school  has  actual  notice  of  the \nconduct. 524 U.S. at 292–93. The Court determined \nthat it would not satisfy the clear-statement rule to \nhold a school liable in such cases “on principles of \nconstructive notice or respondeat superior” because \nthe  school  was  likely  “unaware  of  the \ndiscrimination.” Id. at 287. The Court found support \nin Title IX’s plain text, noting that an enforcement of \nTitle  IX  by  the  federal  government—which  is \nprovided for expressly in the statute—”operates on \nan  assumption  of  actual  notice  to  officials  of  the \nfunding recipient.” Id. at 288. \n2.  Applying  this  clear-statement  rule  to  the \nstatutory language that all parties agree is at issue \n \n \n\n17 \nin  this  case,  it  is  plain  that  Respondent  and  the \nfederal  government  cannot  impose  their  novel \ncondition on the States.  \n For  decades,  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulation have been widely understood to include an \nexpress  provision  authorizing  States  to  provide \nseparate restrooms based on physiological sex. The \nlaw promises States that they may decide at the local \nlevel whether to “maintain[] separate living facilities \nfor the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, including \n“separate toilet, locker rooms, and shower facilities \non  the  basis  of  sex,”  so  long  as  the  facilities  are \n“comparable” for students of both sexes, 34 C.F.R. § \n106.33.  At the  time  of  Title  IX’s passage  in 1972, \ndictionaries  defined  sex  as  a  biological  category \nbased  principally  on  physical  anatomy,  App.  53a–\n55a, and this physiological understanding prevailed \nin  every  prior  case  to  consider  the  question  of \nrestrooms.9  \nDisregarding  this  settled  understanding, \nRespondent  and  the  Department  now  argue  that \nTitle IX actually requires States to provide students \naccess  to  restrooms  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity.  But  that  cannot  be  squared  with  the \nSpending Clause’s clear-statement rule. There is no \nplausible argument that this exemption in Title IX \nunmistakably requires  what  Respondent  and  the \ngovernment  suggest.  If  anything,  Congress  has \ndecided in clear terms to permit States to provide \nseparate facilities by physiological sex. Pet. Br. 7–9, \n                                            \n9 State Amici Br., G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, \nNo. 15-2056, 2015 WL 7749913 at *7–8, 14 & n.1 (4th Cir. Nov. \n30, 2015) (surveying cases). \n \n \n\n18 \n24–41.  Thus,  even  Respondent  has  admitted  that \nwhen  Title  IX  was  enacted,  “few  would  have \nconceived”  that  States  would  face  the  question  of \nbathroom  access  based  on  gender  identity.  BIO  1. \nAnd the Fourth Circuit has done so, too, conceding \nthat Respondent and the Department’s position was \nnot “intuitive” in light of the statute’s text. App. 23a; \nsee also Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n451 U.S. 1, 25 (1981) (noting that it “strains credulity \nto  argue  that  participating  States  should  have \nknown  of  their  ‘obligations’  .  .  .  when  .  .  .  the \ngovernmental  agency  responsible  for  the \nadministration of the Act . . . has never understood \n[the  statutory  provision]  to  impose  conditions  on \nparticipating States”). \nAccordingly,  the  decisions  below  must  be \nreversed. While restroom access in schools may be an \nimportant and evolving public policy question, States \nand  local  school  boards  cannot  be  required  under \nTitle  IX  to  give  students  access  based  on  gender \nidentity because Congress has not “sp[oken] directly” \nto the issue. Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n524 U.S. 274, 292 (1998). In fact, this Court need not \neven determine the best or most plausible reading of \nTitle  IX’s  reference  to  “sex”  may  be,  though \nPetitioner  does  show  persuasively  that  the  term \nrefers  to  physiological  sex.  It  is  enough  that  the \nstatute does not unmistakably require the position \nadvanced by Respondent and the Department. Under \nthis Court’s case law, the States cannot be said to \nhave agreed to any such obligation as a condition of \nreceiving federal funds. \nTo permit the decisions below to stand would be \nwrong  not  only  for  this  case,  but  would  have \n \n \n\n19 \nconsequences for Spending Clause legislation more \nbroadly.  Allowing  this  intrusion  into  state \nsovereignty to go unchecked will encourage federal \ncourts and agencies to introduce new conditions in \nother  Spending  Clause  statutes  to  impose  other \npolicy  changes  that  Congress  could  not  approve \nthrough  ordinary  political  channels.  Indeed,  the \nfederal government has already begun similar efforts \nto  expand  the  definition  of  sex  relating  to \nhealthcare.10  \n3.  Respondent  has  previously  offered  three \narguments  why  the  Spending  Clause’s  clear-\nstatement  rule  does  not  apply  to  constrain  the \ninterpretation of Title IX advanced here. None has \nmerit.   \nFirst,  Respondent  has  alleged  that  any \nconsideration of the clear-statement rule was waived \nin this case, BIO 28, but that is untrue. The question \nat issue is the proper interpretation of the word “sex” \nin  Title  IX  and  its  supporting  regulations.  The \nSpending  Clause  clear-statement  rule  is  merely  a \ntool of statutory construction to be used in resolving \nthat  question.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman,  451  U.S.  1,  24  (1981).  It  is  no  more \nwaivable  than  any  other  principle  of  statutory \ninterpretation, such as ejusdem generis or exclusio \nunius est expressio alterius.   \n                                            \n10 See Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, \n81 Fed. Reg. 31,376 (May 18, 2016) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. \npt.  92),  preliminarily  enjoined  by  Franciscan Alliance v. \nBurwell, slip op., No. 7:16-cv-00108 at *32–34 (N.D. Tex. Dec. \n31, 2016).   \n \n \n\n20 \nMoreover,  even  if  the  Spending  Clause  clear-\nstatement  rule  is  considered  a  distinct  legal \nargument,  this  Court  will  not  deem  waived  any \n“particular legal theories advanced by the parties” to \nresolve a question under review. U.S. Nat’l Bank of \nOr. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, \n446 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \ngrant  of  a  question  for  review  includes  the \nconsideration  of  any  theory  “predicate  to  an \nintelligent resolution” of the question presented, and \n“fairly  included  therein,”  such  as  a  particular \nargument  as to  the  meaning  of  a  statute. Ohio v. \nRobinette, 519 U.S. 33, 38 (1996) (quoting inter alia \nSup. Ct. R. 14.1(a)). After all, “[p]arties cannot waive \nthe correct interpretation of the law simply by failing \nto invoke it.” Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, \n135  S.  Ct.  2076,  2101  n.2  (2015)  (Thomas,  J., \nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in \npart) (citing, e.g., EEOC v. FLRA, 476 U.S. 19, 23 \n(1986) (per curiam)); see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, \n519 U.S. 61, 75 n.13 (1996).  \nIn  any  event,  Respondent  can  hardly  argue \ninadequate notice. Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 \nU.S.  460,  469–70  (2000).  The  States  raised  this \nspecific argument about the clear-statement rule in \ndepth  in  their  briefs  before  the  Fourth  Circuit  at \nboth the panel and petition for en banc stages, as \nwell as before this Court at the petition stage (as did  \nPetitioner).11   \n                                            \n11 See Pet. at 36–37; State Amici Br., Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. \nv. G.G., No. 16-273, 2016 WL 5543363 (U.S. Sept. 27, 2016) \n(petition for certiorari); State Amici Br., G.G. v. Gloucester Cty. \nSch. Bd., No. 15-2056, 2015 WL 7749913 at *8 (4th Cir. Nov. 30, \n \n \n\n21 \nSecond, Respondent has argued that the clear-\nstatement  rule  does  not  apply  to  “requests  for \ninjunctive  relief,”  but  rather  “merely  [to]  the \navailability of ‘money damages.’” BIO 28–29 (quoting \nDavis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. \nof Educ.,  526  U.S.  629, 639  (1999),  and Gebser v. \nLago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist.,  524  U.S.  274,  287 \n(1998).   \nBut neither Davis nor Gebser held that the clear-\nstatement rule is inapplicable to claims for injunctive \nrelief. Those cases concerned only the availability of \nmoney  damages  for  certain  claims  of  sexual \nharassment brought under the implied private right \nof  action.  See Davis,  526  U.S.  at  639  (“We  must \ndetermine whether a district’s failure to respond to \nstudent-on-student  harassment  in  its  schools  can \nsupport a private suit for money damages.”); Gebser, \n524 U.S. at 277 (“The question in this case is when a \nschool district may be held liable in damages in an \nimplied right of action under Title IX . . . for the \nsexual  harassment  of  a  student  by  one  of  the \ndistrict’s teachers.”). Neither case had occasion for \nthe Court to reach the question of the applicability of \nthe  clear-statement  rule  to  injunctive  relief,  and \nneither did so. \nMoreover,  the  rationale  behind  the  Spending \nClause clear-statement rule applies equally to claims \nfor  injunctive  and  monetary  relief.  In  both \ncircumstances, Congress seeks to “impose a condition \non the grant of federal moneys,” and therefore “must \ndo so unambiguously,” so that a court “can fairly say \n                                                                                          \n2015) (panel); State Amici Br., id., 2016 WL 2765036 at *4–5 \n(4th Cir. May 10, 2016) (petition for rehearing en banc). \n \n \n\n22 \nthat  the  State  [had]  ma[d]e  an  informed  choice.” \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman,  451 \nU.S. 1, 17, 25 (1981). If that canon prohibits a court \nfrom  awarding  money  damages  when  a  statute  is \nunclear,  it  certainly  prohibits  imposition  of  costly \nnew  compliance  conditions  via  injunction—such  as \nmonitoring  restroom  access  or  modifying  existing \nfacilities. \nRegardless,  Respondent  does  seek  money \ndamages in this case, and, therefore, cannot escape \napplication  of  the  clear-statement  rule  on  this \nground. BIO 11 n.10.  \nThird, Respondent has alleged that “Title IX puts \nrecipients  on  notice  of  liability  for  all  forms  of \nintentional  discrimination  for  purposes  of \nPennhurst,”  arguing  that  the  federal  government \n“need  not  ‘prospectively  resolve  every  possible \nambiguity concerning particular applications’ of the \nstatute  and  regulations.”  BIO  28–29  (quoting \nBennett v. Kentucky Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, \n669 (1985)). This, too, is unavailing.  \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  this  argument  entirely \nmisses the point. Even if it is true that States are on \nnotice  of  liability  under  Title  IX  for  “all  forms  of \nintentional discrimination” on the basis of sex, that \ndoes not answer the critical question: the meaning of \n“sex.” \nAnd to the extent Respondent is suggesting that \nthe case law permits Congress to impose conditions \nthrough broad or vague terms to be interpreted on a \ncase-by-case basis, that is simply incorrect. A clear \nstatement is necessary both to make a statute apply \n \n \n\n23 \nto the States and to show that the statute applies in \nthe particular manner claimed. E.g., Arlington Cent. \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Edu. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 \n(2006); Gregory v. Ashcroft,  501  U.S.  452,  460–70 \n(1991). After all, a chief purpose of a clear-statement \nrule  is  to  ensure  that  Congress  has  “specifically \nconsidered” an issue and “intentionally legislated on \nthe matter.” Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 290–\n91 (2011).  \nCongress may not through loose draftsmanship \nput  “upon  the  States  a  burden  of  unspecified \nproportions and weight, to be revealed only through \ncase-by-case adjudication in the courts.” Bd. of Educ. \nof Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist., Westchester \nCty. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 190 n.11 (1982). If a \nstatute does not spell out a new obligation plainly, it \n“may not be implied” later on by a court. Sossamon, \n563 U.S. at 284, 290–91. A statute that merely uses \nbroad  or  general  terms,  under  which  a  particular \nobligation on the States is a permissible or plausible \ninference,  lacks  the  necessary  clarity. Dellmuth v. \nMuth, 491 U.S. 223, 232 (1989).  \nFor example, in Sossamon v. Texas, this Court \nheld that Congress had not plainly authorized money \ndamages  against  the  States  under  the  Religious \nLand  Use  and  Institutionalized  Persons  Act—even \nthough the statute provided for “appropriate relief” \nagainst  the  States. 563  U.S.  at  288.  Noting  the \nexistence of “plausible arguments” both ways as to \nthe  meaning  of  the  term  “appropriate  relief,”  this \nCourt  held  that  the  term  was  not  “so  free  from \nambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by \nreceiving  federal  funds,  have  unequivocally \nexpressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity \n \n \n\n24 \nto suits for damages.” Ibid. Accordingly, the Court \n“strictly  constru[ed]”  the  statute  “in  favor  of  the \nsovereign—as we must.” Ibid.  \nOther cases interpreting the Spending Clause or \napplying similar federalism canons prove the same \npoint.  For  instance,  in Pennhurst,  this Court  held \nthat Congress did not provide States clear notice of \ntheir  obligations  under  the  Developmentally \nDisabled  Assistance  and  Bill  of  Rights  Act—even \nthough the Act said that the disabled have a right to \nappropriate  treatment  from  States,  a  broad  right \nthat  arguably  included  some  form  of  specific \nobligation  by  States.  451  U.S.  1,  13,  25  (1981). \nSimilarly,  in Gregory v. Ashcroft,  this  Court  held \nthat  Congress  had  not  specifically  included  state \njudges  in  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment \nAct—even though the Act covered state “appointee[s] \non  the  policymaking  level,”  a  category  that  could \nplausibly be read to include state judges. 501 U.S. \n452,  467  (1991).  Likewise,  in  Arlington Central \nSchool District Board of Education v. Murphy, this \nCourt held that Congress, under the Individuals with \nDisabilities  Education  Act  (IDEA),  had  not  given \nclear notice of its intent to provide for the recovery of \nexpert witness fees against States—even though the \nstatute provided for the recovery of attorney’s fees \n“as part of the costs” of a case, a category arguably \nambiguous  enough  to  include  expert  witness  fees. \n548 U.S. 291, 296–300 (2006) (citation omitted). So, \ntoo, in Bond v. United States, this Court held that \nCongress in a federal criminal law did not provide “a \nclear statement that Congress meant the statute to \nreach  local  criminal  conduct”  and  intrude  upon \ntraditional state criminal jurisdiction—even though \nthe law included an extremely broad prohibition on \n \n \n\n25 \nany use of a chemical weapon, a definition arguably \nbroad enough to include applying harmful chemicals \nto the property of another person. 134 S. Ct. 2077, \n2090 (2014). \nRespondent’s  reliance  on  Bennett v. Kentucky \nDepartment of Education,  for  the  proposition  that \nagencies  may  resolve  how  a  broadly-worded \nstatutory  condition  in  a  Spending  Clause  statute \nshould be applied is misplaced. BIO 29 (citing 470 \nU.S.  656,  669  (1985)).  In  that  case,  this  Court \ndeemed  the  language  at  issue  under  Title I \nunambiguous and found it unnecessary to decide how \nto handle cases of potential ambiguity. Id. at 666, \n670. But this Court made clear, at minimum, that \nthe  States  have  not  “guaranteed  that  their \nperformance  under  the  grant  agreements  would \nsatisfy whatever interpretation of the terms might \nlater be adopted by the Secretary.” Id. at 670. That is \nwhat  Respondent  seeks  to  do  here,  by  imposing  a \ngrant condition on the States articulated for the first \ntime decades after the States first accepted Title IX \nfunds. Nothing in Bennett suggests that a State can \nbe held to conditions or obligations of which it did not \nhave notice. \nNor do the Title IX cases cited by Respondent \nstand  for  such  a  proposition.  In  both,  this  Court \nreaffirmed  not  only  that  Title  IX  is  a  Spending \nClause  statute,  but  also  that  a  funding  recipient \nmust  have  “adequate  notice”  of  the  conditions \nimposed.  See Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. \nMonroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999); \nJackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, \n181–82 (2005).  \n \n \n\n26 \nC.  Were  This  Court  To  Expansively  Interpret \nTitle IX, States Would Be Unconstitutionally \nCoerced  Into  Accepting  New  Grant \nConditions Long After the Receipt of Funds. \nBeyond  violating  the  clear-statement  rule, \nRespondent  and  the  Department’s  new  condition \nraises  a  second,  independent  problem  under  the \nSpending  Clause:  unconstitutional  coercion.  The \n“Constitution  has  never  been  understood  to  confer \nupon Congress the ability to require the States to \ngovern  according  to  Congress’  instructions.”  New \nYork v. United States,  505  U.S.  144,  162  (1992). \nThus, this Court reaffirmed just four years ago that \n“Congress  may  use  its  spending  power  to  create \nincentives for States to act in accordance with federal \npolicies,” but “when ‘pressure turns to compulsion,’ \nthe  legislation  runs  contrary  to  our  system  of \nfederalism.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, \n132 S. Ct. 2566, 2602 (2012) (Roberts, C.J.) (internal \ncitation omitted). \nRespondent and the Department’s view of the law \nwould exert through Title IX a “power akin to undue \ninfluence.” Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. \n548, 590 (1937). States would face a choice between \ngiving up their reserved power to set policies for the \nuse of school facilities or the entirety of their federal \neducation funding on which they have come to rely \nfor decades. This “financial ‘inducement’” is “much \nmore  than  ‘relatively  mild  encouragement.’”  Nat’l \nFed’n of Indep. Bus., 132 S. Ct. at 2604. Like the \nthreatened  loss  of  all  Medicaid  funding  on  which \nStates  had  long  relied  in  National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the threatened loss of 100% of \na  State’s  federal  education  funding  based  on  a \n \n \n\n27 \nnewfound  condition  “is  economic  dragooning  that \nleaves  the  States  with  no  real  option  but  to \nacquiesce.” Id. at 2605.  \nThe import of federal funding to local education \ncan hardly be overstated. School districts throughout \nthe  country  share  nearly  $56  billion  in  annual \nfunding  that  the  federal  government  directs  to \neducation.12 These funds amount to an average of 9.3 \npercent of total spending on public elementary and \nsecondary education nationwide, roughly $1,000 per \npupil.13  West  Virginia’s  public  elementary  and \nsecondary schools receive an average of $380,192,000 \nin federal funds annually, $1,343 per pupil, which \namounts to about 10.7 percent of the State’s total \nrevenue  for  public  elementary  and  secondary \nschools.14  In  some  States,  like  Arizona,  Kentucky, \nTennessee, and Texas, the numbers reach higher and \ncomprise  nearly  20%  of  the  total  school  budget.15 \nMuch of the money goes to poor and special-needs \nchildren.16 It is difficult to imagine a clearer instance \n                                            \n12 Not counting funds paid directly to state education agencies, \nor funds paid for non-elementary and secondary programs, the \nnational amount of direct federal funding to public elementary \nand  secondary  schools  alone  exceeds  $55,862,552,000  on \naverage annually.

See Com. of Va., Dep’t of Educ. \nv. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 570 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) \n(Luttig,  J.)  (describing  the  threat  of  withholding \neducation funding as raising a “Tenth Amendment \nclaim of the highest order”).  \nII.  Auer  Deference  Has  No  Application  In  This \nCase. \nRespondent  cannot  escape  the  requirements  of \nthe  Spending  Clause  by  claiming  deference  under \nAuer  v.  Robbins  to  the  Department’s  informal \nopinion  letter.  519  U.S.  452  (1997).  The  Auer \ndoctrine,  under  which  a  court  affords  controlling \ndeference  to  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  an \nambiguous  regulation,  cannot  be  squared  with \njudicial enforcement of the Spending Clause’s clear-\nstatement rule, which requires that Congress speak \nunequivocally in statutory text if it intends to place a \nbinding  condition  on  the  States’  receipt  of  federal \nfunds.  Indeed,  while  Pennhurst  requires  clear \nstatutory  notice  at  the  time  of  enactment,  the \nDepartment adopted its interpretation in this case \nonly after the school board had allegedly violated the \nstatute. See Pet. Br. 13. It is fundamentally unfair, \nand  indeed,  impermissibly  retroactive,  to  impose \nregulatory  obligations  on  States  in  this  manner. \nBowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 \n(1988). \n                                                                                          \nteachers  for  disabled  students,  Individuals  with  Disabilities \nEducation Act, Pub. L. 101-476, 104 Stat. 1142 (1990).  \n \n \n\n29 \nA.  Because  Statutes  Enacted  Under  The \nSpending  Clause  Must  Clearly  Articulate \nThe  States’  Obligations,  Agencies  Cannot \nReceive  Controlling  Deference  For \nInterpretations of Their Own Rules.  \nWhatever  place  Auer  deference  may  have  in \nother  contexts,  it  can have  no  role  in interpreting \nstatutes enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause. \nUnder  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  unrestrained \nunderstanding of Auer, a court provides controlling \ndeference to an agency’s preferred interpretation of a \nrule  without  first  discerning  either  whether \nCongress spoke clearly to the question at issue or \nwhether Congress intended to delegate interpretive \nauthority on that question to the agency. Pet. Br. 44–\n49, 55–58. Moreover, that interpretation can occur, \nas  here,  decades  after  the  regulation  itself  or  the \nunderlying statute was enacted.  \nThis  approach  to  regulation  is  fundamentally \ninconsistent  with  the  Spending  Clause  clear-\nstatement  rule  and  the  federalism  principles \nmotivating  that  rule.  As  explained  earlier,  when \nCongress places conditions on the States’ receipt of \nfederal funds, it must make those conditions explicit \nin the text of the statute at the time of enactment. \nLike  this  Court’s  other  clear-statement  federalism \ncanons, this rule is designed to ensure that courts \nare  “absolutely  certain,” Gregory v. Ashcroft,  501 \nU.S. 452,  464 (1991), before finding that Congress \ndisplaced the States in any particular case. The core \nprinciple in Auer—that a court need not inquire at \nall  into  congressional  intent—cannot  be  reconciled \nwith that requirement.  \n \n \n\n30 \nAuer deference also should not apply in Spending \nClause cases because of its  retroactive effect. This \nCourt has applied a clear-statement rule to Spending \nClause  cases  in  part  because  Spending  Clause \nlegislation is treated much like a contract. To ensure \nthat States have knowingly and voluntarily decided \nwhether  to  accept  certain  costly  obligations  in \nexchange for receipt of federal funds, this Court has \nrequired that Congress state those conditions clearly \non the face of the statute. But Auer presumes that \ndeference  is  owed  to  agency  interpretations \nregardless of when the interpretation is made, which \neffectively  allows  an  agency  to  “modify  past \nagreements  with  recipients  by  unilaterally  issuing \nguidelines.” Rosa H. v. San Elizario Indep. Sch. Dist., \n106  F.3d  648,  658  (5th  Cir.  1997).  This  is \nfundamentally  unfair,  contrary  to  this  Court’s \nrepeated  statements  that  States  must  have  plain \nnotice  of  their  obligations  when  accepting  federal \nfunds,  and  should  not  be  permitted.  Indeed, \nretroactive  regulatory  power does  not  exist in any \ncircumstances  absent  a  clear  statement  from \nCongress.  Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.,  488 \nU.S. 204, 208 (1988). \n \nIn this clash of interpretive principles, the one \nrooted  in  the  Constitution—the  federalism  clear-\nstatement rule—must prevail.17 Even in the context \nof Chevron deference, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984), this \n                                            \n17 For scholarship on this topic, see, e.g., Abbe R. Gluck, Our \n(National) Federalism, 123 Yale L.J. 1996, 2028 (2014); Nina A. \nMendelson, Chevron and Preemption, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 737, \n742, 799–800 (2004); Peter J. Smith, Pennhurst, Chevron, and \nthe Spending Power, 110 Yale L.J. 1187, 1189–91 (2001).   \n \n \n\n31 \nCourt has applied clear-statement rules, rather than \ndefer to a contrary agency position, when necessary \n“to  avoid  the  significant  constitutional  and \nfederalism  questions  raised  by  [an  agency’s] \ninterpretation.” Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. \n(SWANCC) v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 U.S. \n159,  172–74  (2001).    In  Gregory v. Ashcroft,  for \ninstance,  this  Court  relied  on  Pennhurst,  and \nrejected  a  contrary  agency  interpretation, when  it \ndeclined to extend the protections of the federal Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act to state judges. \n501 U.S. at 470. The Court reasoned that the Act’s \nreference to “appointee[s] on the policymaking level” \nwas “at least ambiguous” as applied to state judges \n“in  light  of  the  ADEA’s  clear  exclusion  of  most \nimportant  public  officials.”  Ibid.  This  Court  thus \nconcluded that, absent clearer language, it would not \npresume  that  Congress  intended  to  intrude  on \nStates’ traditional authority over the judiciary. See \nibid. In so doing, the Court declined to afford any \ndeference to the EEOC’s competing interpretation of \nthe statute, over a dissent urging that the agency’s \nposition be accorded Chevron deference. See Gregory, \n501 U.S. at 493 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).18  \n                                            \n18 Federal circuit courts have also read this Court’s opinions as \naffording interpretive precedence to clear-statement rules over \nagency deference. E.g., Sch. Dist. of City of Pontiac v. Sec’y of \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 277 (6th Cir. 2009); Rosa H. \nv. San Elizario Indep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 648, 658 (5th Cir. \n1997); Com. of Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 567 \n(4th Cir. 1997) (en banc); Doe v. Bd. of Educ. of Oak Park & \nRiver Forest High Sch. Dist. 200, 115 F.3d 1273, 1278–79 (7th \nCir. 1997); see also Carter v. Welles-Bowen Realty, Inc., 736 \nF.3d  722,  731,  734  (6th  Cir.  2013)  (Sutton,  J.,  concurring); \nHarris v. James, 127 F.3d 993, 1009 (11th Cir. 1997).   \n \n \n\n32 \nAmici are not aware of any case in which this \nCourt  has  ever  applied  Auer  deference  when \ninterpreting  a  statute  subject  to  a  clear-statement \nrule, including under Title IX. This case should not \nbe the first. Instead, this Court should resolve the \ntension between Auer and the clear-statement rule \nby  reaffirming  that  the  Constitution’s  clear-\nstatement rule takes precedence over the judge-made \ntheory of Auer deference. \nB.  This Court Need Not Address Whether Any \nOther Controlling Deference Is Appropriate \nIn Spending Clause Cases. \nWhile SWANCC and Gregory suggest that there \nmay be circumstances where a clear-statement rule \ntrumps  even Chevron deference,  that  issue  is  not \npresented  in  this  case,  and  should  not  deter  this \nCourt from addressing the tension between Auer and \nthe  Spending  Clause  clear-statement  rule.  For \nChevron deference to apply, a court must first assure \nitself that Congress explicitly intended to delegate \ninterpretive  authority  to  an  agency,  and  that  the \nagency acted with the degree of formality required by \nCongress  under  the  implementing  statute  and  the \nAPA—which  in  the  case  of  rules  requires,  at \nminimum,  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  comment. \nSee United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229–\n34 (2001)). These protections, which help ensure that \nStates have a meaningful role in both the legislative \nand  rulemaking  processes  before  courts  defer  to  a \nregulatory interpretation, are not satisfied here.  \nTo  begin  with,  there  is  no  indication  that \nCongress  intended  to  delegate  to  the  agency \ninterpretive authority over the statutory language at \n \n \n\n33 \nissue.  The  Department  has  purported  to  interpret \nthe term “sex”—a plain English word that appears \nboth in Title IX and in the implementing rule—to \nrequire schools to permit students to access intimate \nareas  consistent  with  their  gender  identity.  But \nthere  is  no  evidence  that  Congress  considered  the \nterm “sex” ambiguous or intended to delegate to the \nDepartment the authority to interpret it; nor is there \nany  reason  to  believe  the  Department  has  any \nspecial expertise in elucidating the meaning of that \nword.  What  is  more,  the  word  the  Department \npurports to interpret appears in an explicit statutory \nsafe  harbor.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that \nCongress intended that safe harbor to be a font of \nadditional liability for States to arise whenever the \nDepartment changed its view of the meaning of the \nword “sex.” And finally, given the Pennhurst clear-\nstatement rule, this Court should not strain to locate \na source of congressional delegation in this Spending \nClause statute where one does not exist. \nEven if there were a clear congressional mandate \nin Title IX for the Department to interpret the term \n“sex,” the Department’s opinion letter still would not \ntrigger Chevron deference,  because  it  failed  to  act \nwith the requisite formality required by Title IX and \nthe APA. As Petitioner explains, Title IX provides \nthat the Department can only bind regulated parties \nwith  the  force  of  law  if  the  Department  issues  a \n“rule, regulation, or order” that is approved by the \nPresident. Pet. Br. 61–62 (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1682). \nAnd  under  the  APA,  rules  can  only  be  enacted \nfollowing  notice  and  an  opportunity  for  public \ncomment.  See 5  U.S.C.  §  553.  These  are  clear \ninstructions  on  the  conditions  under  which  the \nDepartment could issue a binding regulation under \n \n \n\n34 \nTitle IX—procedures that the States were aware of \nwhen  they  first  agreed  to  accept  funds  under  the \nstatute. The Department’s letter failed to meet those \nrequirements  and  thus  cannot  have  any  force  or \neffect on the States. \nTo be sure, the Department did issue a formal \nrule concerning restroom access that provides that \nfunding  recipients  “may  provide  separate  toilet, \nlocker  room,  and  shower  facilities  on  the  basis  of \nsex.” 34 C.F.R. § § 106.33 (emphasis added). But that \nrule does not purport to interpret the term “sex” in \nTitle IX; it merely parrots the statutory language. If \nthe Department hoped to obtain any deference for its \ninterpretation of the term “sex” in Title IX, it would \nneed first to comply with Title IX’s procedures for \nvalid rulemaking—which it has not done here. \nThese protections are vitally important, because \n“[u]nlike  Congress,  administrative  agencies  are \nclearly  not  designed  to  represent  the  interests  of \nStates.” Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, \n908 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Because agencies \nare  not  subject  to  structural  checks  that  provide \n“adequate protection against agency failure to take \nfederalism concerns seriously,” the only way in which \nStates can influence regulatory action is through the \nAPA’s  “opportunities  for  state  notification  and \nparticipation  created  by  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedures and amplified by substantive \nrequirements  of  agency  explanation  and  reasoned \ndecisionmaking.” Gillian E. Metzger, Administrative \nLaw As the New Federalism,  57  Duke  L.J.  2023, \n2083–84  (2008).  Uncritical  deference  to  informal \nopinion  letters  robs  the  States  of  this  role  in  the \n \n \n\n35 \nrulemaking  process—and  deprives  States  of  any \nsemblance of notice to guide their future actions. \n* * * \nUltimately,  Respondent  seeks  to  prohibit  the \nStates from doing what Title IX promises the States \nthey  may  do:  decide  at  the  local  level  whether  to \nseparate  school  facilities  by  physiological  sex. \nReinterpreting Title IX to mean the opposite of what \nit says, decades after funds were accepted, coerces \nthe States into accepting conditions that they could \nnot possibly have voluntarily or knowingly accepted \nat the time they first opted into the Title IX regime. \nThe  Spending  Clause  to  the  U.S.  Constitution \nprohibits that result.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe decisions below should be reversed. \n   \n \n \n\n36 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPatrick Morrisey \n Attorney General \n \nElbert Lin \n Solicitor General \n  Counsel of Record \n \nThomas M.
