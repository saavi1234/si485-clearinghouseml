Under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 federal agencies dis-\npensing funds are charged with the responsibility of insuring non-\ndiscrimination in the programs they administer. Specifically, each\nagency is directed \"to effectuate the provisions of [Title VI] * * *\nby issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.\"\nIf recipients fail to comply with these requirements, the responsible\nfederal agency is authorized to secure compliance by terminating\nfinancial assistance or by \"any other means authorized by law.\"\nPursuant to these statutory obligations, virtually all federal agencies\nhave adopted regulations that prohibit recipients from engaging in\npractices that have the effect of discriminating on the ground of\n\n-2-\n1/\nrace, color or national origin.(cid:9) Wilmington Medical Center's (WMC)\nargument (Br. 13 n. 9) that Title VI prohibits only purposeful dis-\ncrimination is inconsistent with this federal position and if\naccepted, could impede effective enforcement of \nTitle VI.\nThe United States also has a substantial interest in the\nresolution of the question whether Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1973 prohibits only intentional discrimination against the\nhandicapped.

The Court's decision\nin this case could affect the validity of these regulations.\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\nThe United States will address the following two questions:\n1. Whether Title VI authorizes federal agencies to adopt\nregulations that prohibit practices which are discriminatory in\neffect, but not in purpose.\n2. Whether a violation of Section 504 can be established\nwithout proof of intentional discrimination.\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the exception of the discussion in the footnote below,\nthe United States' brief addresses only the questions whether\na violation of Title VI and Section 504 can be established without\n2/\nproof of discriminatory intent.(cid:9) Appellants have argued that a\nviolation of these statutes can be established without such proof,\nwhile Wilmington Medical Center (WMC) has argued that such proof is\nessential. We agree with appellants that discriminatory intent is\nnot a necessary element of a cause of action under either Title VI\nor Section 504.\n2/ In deciding that Congress intended to apply a lesser degree of\nscrutiny to actions resulting in age discrimination than to those\nresulting in racial discrimination, the district court relied upon\nthe reference in the original Age Discrimination Act to \"unreason-\nable\" age discrimination. The 1978 amendments to the Act removed\nthe word unreasonable from the Act's statement of purpose. See\n42 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 6101. Accordingly, there is no longer any basis\nfor drawing a distinction between what the Age Discrimination Act\nprohibits and what Title VI and Section 504 prohibit.\n\n-4-\nThe district court held that appellants had failed to\nestablish any violations under either an intent standard or an\nimpact standard. It therefore saw no need to decide which\nstandard was the appropriate one. While appellants have not\nchallenged the district court's conclusion that they failed to\ndemonstrate discriminatory intent, they have attacked many of\nthe predicates for the district court's conclusion that WMC\nwould also prevail under an impact standard. Should this\nCourt agree with one or more of their contentions, it will\nhave to decide whether intent is a necessary element of a\ncause of action under Title VI or Section 504. The purpose of\nthis brief is to assist the Court in resolving those questions.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES'\nTITLE VI REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN EFFECTS\nSTANDARD TO BE APPLIED IN THIS CASE\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d,\nprovides that:\nNo person in the United States shall,\non the ground of race, color, or national\norigin, be excluded from participation in,\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected\nto discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Act also requires federal agencies to issue regulations to\nenforce these prohibitions. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. The Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), the predecessor to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), adopted several such\nregulations. One regulation prohibits recipients from using\n\"criteria or methods of administration which have the effect\nof subjecting individuals to discrimination\" or have \"the\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment\nof the objectives of the program.\" 45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(2). Another\nproscribes site selections that have \"the effect of excluding\nindividuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting\nthem to discrimination under any [federally assisted] programs.\"\n45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(3).\nUnder both of these regulations, the recipient's intent is\nirrelevant. A practice with a disparate effect on a group protected\nby Title VI violates the regulations, unless the recipient can\ndemonstrate that the challenged practice is a \"program necessity.\"\nThis requirement is similar to that imposed by provisions of other\n3/\nCivil Rights statutes and involves a showing that (1) the practice\nsubstantially serves one or more of the purposes of the program\nreceiving federal assistance and that (2) there are no less\n3/ Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) (under Title VII,\nemployment practices with a disproportionate impact must be justified\nby business necessity); Board of Education v. Harris 444 U.S. 130, 151\n(1979) (under the Emergency School Aid Act, faculty assignment practices\nwith a disproportionate impact must be justified by educational neces-\nsity). Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 149 (3d Cir.\n1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978) (under Title VIII, a housing\npractice with a disparate effect must be justified by a showing that it\nsubstantially serves a legitimate interest and that no alternative with\nless discriminatory impact would serve that interest equally well.\n\n-6-\ndiscriminatory alternatives that would serve these purposes\n4/\nequally well.\nBecause HHS's regulations incorporate an \"effects standard\"\nrather than an \"intent standard,\" they may prohibit some practices\nthat would not violate the Constitution. See Washington v. Davis,\n426 U.S. 229 (1976). The question we address is whether Title\nVI authorizes such regulations.\nA. Lau v. Nichols establishes the validity of the Department\nof Health and Human Services' regulations\nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568 (1974), the Supreme\nCourt expressly approved the very regulations at issue in this\ncase as a proper interpretation of Title VI and held that under\nTitle VI \"discrimination is barred which has that effect even\n4/ The district court held that WMC had the burden of producing\nevidence but not the burden of persuasion on the issue of program\nnecessity. This holding is incorrect. While the district court\nproperly turned to Title VII for guidance in resolving the issue,\nit failed to recognize that there are two kinds of Title VII\ncases, disparate treatment cases and disproportionate impact\ncases. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15\n(1977). Disparate treatment cases involve claims that an\nemployer treats some people less favorably than others because\nof a personal characteristic such as race. In such cases,\nproof of discriminatory intent is critical. Disproportionate\nimpact cases involve claims that an employment practice, though\nfacially neutral, has a disproportionate impact on a group\nprotected by Title VII and is not justified by business necessity.\nIn these cases, proof of discriminatory intent is not required.\nIn a disparate treatment case, once a prima facie case is shown,\nthe employer need only produce evidence of a non-discriminatory\nreason for its decision. In a disproportionate impact case,\nhowever, the employer has the burden of persuasion on the\nissue of business necessity. Vulcan v. Civil Service Commission,\n490 F.2d 387, 393 (2d Cir. 1973). Because program necessity\nis a justification for a practice that would otherwise violate\nTitle VI and not evidence designed to rebut an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent, the appropriate Title VII analogy is to\nthe disproportionate impact cases, rather than the disparate\ntreatment cases relied upon by the district court. Thus, under\nTitle VI, the recipient has the burden of persuasion and not merely\nthe burden of producing evidence on the issue of program necessity.\n\n- 7 -\n5 /\nthough no purposeful design is present.\" The Court stated that\nTitle VI was an exercise of Congress' power \"to fix the terms\nupon which its money allotments to the State shall be disbursed\"\nand concluded that \"[w]hatever may be the limits of that power,\n* * * they have not been reached here.\" Id. at 569. Lau's\ninterpretation of Title VI is binding on this Court and should\nbe followed in this case.\nWithout any discussion of Lau, Wilmington Medical Center\nasserts that a violation of Title VI cannot be established\nwithout proof of discriminatory purpose. It relies almost exclu-\nsively on the Supreme Court's decisions in Regents of the University\nof California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) and Board of Education\n6/\nv. Harris, 444 U.S. 130 (1979) to support this assertion (cid:9) WMC's\nreliance on Bakke and Harris is misplaced.\nBakke did not purport to overrule Lau; indeed, all nine\njustices cited Lau with approval. 438 U.S. at 303-304 (Powell, J.);\nid. at 342, 350-353 (Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun, JJ.);\nid. at 416-417 and n. 20 (Stevens, J.) Nor is the holding in Bakke\ninconsistent with the holding in Lau.\nBakke involved a medical school admission program that\ncreated an explicit preference for members of certain racial\ngroups.(cid:9) The defendant university did not deny that it intended\n5/ The Court specifically held that a school district's failure\nto attempt to rectify the language deficiency of Chinese speaking\nchildren violated Title VI, even though the school board's failure\nto offer remedial instruction was not motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\n6 /The only other decision relied upon by WMC is Guardians v. Civil\nService Commission, 23 Empl. Prac. Dec. 11 31,153 (D.C. N.Y. 1980)\n(petition for rehearing pending). In that case two district court\njudges sitting by designation concluded that Bakke had overruled Lau.\nFor the reasons discussed above, that conclusion is incorrect and\nshould not be followed.\n\nto treat minority applicants more favorably than white applicants.\nInstead, it sought to justity this preference as a remedy for\npast discrimination.\nAccordingly, the only Title VI issue in Bakke was whether\nTitle VI prohibits all explicit racial preferences, including those\nintended to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Four\njustices interpreted Title VI as a per se ban on all racial\npreferences, regardless of what the Constitution would permit.\nIt was in response to this contention that a majority of the Court\nheld that Title VI permits an explicit use of race so long as\nit is consistent with the Constitution. Mr. Justice Powell stated\nthat \"Title VI must be held to proscribe only those racial class-\nifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the\nFifth Amendment.\" Id. at 287 (emphasis added). And the four\njustices in the Brennan group agreed that \"Title VI goes no further\nin prohibiting the use of race than the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment itself.\" Id. at 325 (emphasis added).\nThus, Bakke involved only the question whether a purposeful\nacknowledged use of race could be justified under Title VI.\nBecause the university conceded that its resort to race was\ndeliberate, the question whether a violation could be established\nwithout proof of such intentional discrimination was not at\nissue. In this situation, Lau continues to state the governing\nprinciple -- practices with a discriminatory effect are pro-\nhibited \"even though no purposeful design is present.\" 414 U.S.\nat 568.\n\n-9-\nWe recognize that the Brennan group appears to have con-\ncluded that Title VI is absolutely coextensive with the Constitution\nand that Lau therefore may have been incorrectly decided. 438 U.S.\nat 352. But the Brennan group also sought to reconcile their\ndecision with Lau. Independent of their conclusion that Title VI\nshould always be interpreted like the Constitution, the Brennan\ngroup rejected a color blind interpretation of Title VI because\nit would be inconsistent with Congress' expressed purpose of\nending the legacy of discrimination against blacks and other\nhistorically disadvantaged groups. Id. at 340, 353, 355.\nAs they put it, a statute \"designed to eliminate discrimination\nagainst racial minorities\" should not be interpreted \"in a\nmanner which would impede efforts to obtain this objective.\"\n7/\nId. at 355.\nMoreover, the fact that some justices have expressed\ndoubts about a decision \"does not make it any less binding upon\n[this Court].\" United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 450\nF.2d 232, 239 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1063 (1972).\nThis Court is simply \"not free to disregard an existing fiat and\nstill live holding of the Supreme Court.\" Ashe v. Swenson, 399 F.2d\n40, 45 (8th Cir. 1968), reversed on other grounds, 397 U.S. 436.\n7 / The Supreme Court applied precisely this principle in holding\nthat Title VII does not prohibit all race conscious affirmative\naction plans. United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 201-202\n(1979).\n\n- 10 -\nHarris did not involve a question under Title VI at all.\nThat case concerned the proper construction of the Emergency\nSchool Aid Act (ESAA), a statute that makes federal aid available\nto local school districts that undertake efforts to reduce\nminority group isolation. The particular provision under\nreview prohibited \"discrimination\" in the assignment of faculty.\nThe Court held that this provision prohibits school districts\nfrom maintaining racially segregated faculties, even if the\nsegregation is not intentional.\nTitle VI was introduced into the case by the school\ndistrict, which argued that Title VI has an intent standard and\nthat ESAA should be interpreted like Title VI. The Court\nspecifically declined to resolve the question of the standard\nof liability under Title VI, however, because it found no\nevidence \"that the two Acts were intended to be coextensive.\"\n444 U.S. at 149.\nThe Court in Harris did not even mention Lau, much less\noverrule it. And the Court's careful reservation of the question\nof the appropriate standard of liability under Title VI makes clear\nthat Bakke did not overrule Lau either.\nWMC's view that Harris supports an intent standard under Title\nVI apparently comes from the Court's observation that (id. at\n150):\n\n- 11 -\nIt does make sense * * * that Congress\nmight impose a stricter standard under\nESAA than under Title VI * * *. A\nviolation of Title VI may result in a\ncut off of all federal funds and it is\nlikely that Congress would wish this\ndrastic result only when the discrimination\nis intentional.\nThis Court should not be guided by this statement for several\nreasons.\nFirst, it is apparent from the Court's brief discussion\nthat it merely presumed that the availability of the fund\ntermination remedy might have prompted Congress to adopt an\nintent standard; the Court did not actually investigate the\n8/\nquestion.\nA careful review of the legislative history leads to\na different conclusion. Thus, opponents of the bill repeatedly\nargued that the fund termination remedy was too drastic and\nthat Title VI showed be defeated for this reason alone. The\n8/(cid:9) Indeed, the only basis for the Court's presumption was\nthat a violation of Title VI would result in a cut off of all\nfederal funds. However, fund termination must \"be limited in\nits effect to a particular program, or part thereof * * *\n[where] noncompliance has been so found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\nSince fund termination under Title VI must be program specific,\nit is arguably no more drastic than a refusal to fund a project\nunder ESAA.\n\n- 12 -\nproponents of the bill did not respond to these attacks with\nassurances that Title VI would only be applied in cases of\nracial animus, however. Instead, they emphasized that the\nstrict procedural safeguards built into Title VI would provide\nadequate protection against the possibility that funds would be\n9/\nterminated without \nsufficient justification.—(cid:9)The logical inference\nis that Congress sought to ameliorate the harshness of the fund\ntermination remedy by guaranteeing procedural fairness and not by\nlimiting Title VI to instances of intentional discrimination.\n9(cid:9) 110 Cong. Rec. 6749 (Sen. Moss); id. at 6544 (Sen. Humphrey);\nI. at 1519 (Rep. Celler); id. at 7066-7067 (Sen. Ribicoff);\nid. at 8345 (Sen. Proxmire); id. at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel).\nSenator Moss pointed out that before federal funds are withdrawn,\n(110 Cong. Rec. 6749):\n[R]egulations giving notice of what conduct\nis required must be drawn up by the agency\nadministering the program. * * * Before such\nregulations become effective, they must\nbe submitted to and approved by the President.\nOnce having become effective, there\nis still a long road to travel before any\nsanction whatsoever is imposed. Formal\naction to compel compliance can only take\nplace after the following has occurred:\nfirst, there must be an unsuccessful attempt\nto obtain voluntary compliance; second, there\nmust be an administrative hearing; third,\na written report of the circumstances and\nthe grounds for such action must be filed\nwith the appropriate committees of the\nHouse and Senate; and fourth, 30 days\nmust have elapsed between such filing and\nthe action denying benefits under a\nFederal program. Finally, even that\n(continued)\n\n- 13 -\nSecond, the dictum in Harris addresses the issue of the\nTitle VI standard only as it applies to fund terminations, while\nthis suit is one for injunctive relief. While we believe that\nproof of intentional discrimination is not required to make out a\nviolation of Title VI in any type of enforcement action, \none\ncourt of appeals has suggested that the dicta in Harris may be\ncompletely inapplicable in suits for injunctive relief. Bryan v.\nKoch, Nos. 80-6085, 80-7401 (2d Cir., July 10, 1980).\nFinally, this Court's obligation is to follow the law as\nit currently stands, regardless of how the Supreme Court may\nultimately decide the issue. Because neither Bakke nor Harris\noverruled Lau, it remains good law and this Court has no authority\n10/\nto disregard it\n / (continued)\naction is by no means final because\nit is subject to judicial review and can\nbe further postponed by judicial action\ngranting temporary relief pending review\nin order to avoid irreparable injury. It\nwould be difficult indeed to concoct any\nadditional safeguards.\nThese procedures are found in 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\n10/ The Supreme Court's recent decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4979 (U.S. July 2, 1980), confirms the propriety of\nfollowing Supreme Court precedent rather than attempting to\npredict how various justices will decide an issue when it\nfinally comes before them. There, the plurality opinion cited\nLau with approval, although two of the justices joining the\nopinion had previously questioned it. Id. at 4987-4988.\n\n- 14 -\nB. The regulations at issue in this case are authorized\nby Title VI\n1. The administrative interpretation of Title VI\nis reasonable\nWe believe that this Court is not free to reexamine Lau.\nHowever, because this Court may disagree, we now address the\nvalidity of the Title VI regulations at issue. In arguing\nthat the regulations are invalid, WMC ignores the critical\npoint that the interpretation of a statute by those charged\nwith its enforcement \"is entitled to great deference,\" and\nshould be followed \"unless these are compelling indications it\nis wrong.\" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434\n(1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965); Red Lion Broad-\ncasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969). This principle\napplies with even greater force here because Congress has\ndelegated HHS and other federal agencies the task of formulating\nlegislative regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.\n11/\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141 (1976). In\nthis situation, the agency's interpretation of the statute\nmust be followed unless it is \"demonstrably irrational.\"\nFord Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 48 U.S.L.W. 4145, 4148\n(U.S. Feb. 20, 1980).\nUnder Title VI, agencies are \"directed to effectuate the\nprovisions of section 2000d * * * by issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. Because\nthe statute expressly provides that non-compliance with the reg-\nulations may lead directly to sanctions (ibid.), the regulations\nare properly classified as legislative rather than merely\ninterpretive. Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S. at 141-142; Chrysler\nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301-302 (1979); see generally,\nK.C. Davis, Administrative Law § 5.03 (3d ed. 1972).\n\n- 15 -\nTo be sure, in some circumstances it is appropriate to\nattach less weight than usual to an agency's interpretation of\na statute. But there is no basis for departing from the usual\nrule here.\nThus, this is not a case where the agency's interpretation\nwas formulated long after passage of the Act. Gilbert, supra, 429\nU.S. at *142. The regulations at issue in this case were first\nadopted in 1964, only several months after Title VI became\neffective. Such contemporaneous regulations are a particularly\nreliable indication of the meaning of the Act. Udall v. Tallman,\nsupra, 380 U.S. at 16; Power Reactor Co. v. Electricians, 367\nU.S. 396, 408 (1961).\nNor is this a case where the administrative interpretation\nis entitled to less weight than usual because it \"conflict[s]\nwith earlier pronouncements of the agency.\" Gilbert, supra,\n429 U.S. at 143; Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 93-\n94 (1973). HHS and its predecessor, HEW, have consistently\ninterpreted the Act as prohibiting acts with a discriminatory\neffect.\nFinally, this is not a case where the agencies enforcing\nthe statute are divided on the proper interpretation of the\nstatute and the principle of agency deference therefore points\n\"in diametrically opposite directions.\" Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S.\nat 145. To the contrary, at least twenty-five federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI have adopted regulations that prohibit\npractices with a discriminatory effect. See note 1, supra.\n\n- 16 -\nAccordingly, the issue is whether this federal position\nis \"demonstrably irrational.\" Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin,\nsupra, 48 U.S.L.W. at 4148. is we demonstrate below, the inter-\npretation of Title VI adopted by the federal agencies is not only\na rational one, but it is the one that is most consistent with\nthe language of the statute and its legislative history.\na. The language of the statute\nThe argument that Title VI was intended to be absolutely\ncoextensive with the Equal Protection Clause and that it\ntherefore prohibits only intentional discrimination is not\nsupported by the language of the statute. The statute\ndoes not protect beneficiaries of federally assisted programs\nagainst \"denials of equal protection.\" Instead, the statutory\nterms provide that no person is to be \"excluded from,\" \"denied\nthe benefits of\" or \"subjected to discrimination under\" any\nfederal program. If Congress had the limited objective of\nprohibiting denials of equal protection and nothing more, it\npresumably would have used equal protection language.\nA comparison between the language of Title VI and other\ntitles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 strongly supports this\nconclusion. Title III of the Act protects an individual from\nbeing \"deprived of * * * his right to the equal protection of the\nlaws * * * by being denied equal utilization of any public\nfacility.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000b. And Title IV of the same Act\nprotects a minor child from \"being deprived by a school board\nof the equal protection of the laws.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6.\n\n- 17 -\nThus, when Congress wanted to incorporate equal protection\nstandards, it used equal protection language. The far more\nexpansive language in Title VI is strong evidence that Congress\ndid not intend to link Title VI to the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\nh. Legislative history\nThe legislative history of Title VI supports the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. Thus, President Kennedy, in his\nmessage to Congress proposing the legislation that ultimately\nbecame Title VI, outlined the broad objectives of the proposal\n(109 Cong. Rec. 1161 (1964))(emphasis added):\nSimple justice requires that public funds,\nto which all taxpayers contribute, not be\nspent in any fashion which encourages,\nentrenches, subsidizes or results in racial\ndiscrimination.\nSenator Humphrey repeated President Kennedy's message in his\nspeech opening the debate on Title VI. 110 Cong. Rec. 6543.\nAnd the statements of other proponents also reflect that Congress\nwas concerned with results of recipients' practices and not simply the\n12/\nmotivation.\n12/ 110 Cong. Rec. 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id. at 2484 (Rep. O'Hara);\nid. at 1519 (Rep. Celler).\n\n- 18 -\nThis emphasis on eliminating discriminatory results\nregardless of motivation was not lost on opponents of the bill.\nFor example, Congressman Robertson complained that under Title VI,\nas under Title VII, \"it would not be necessary to show any willful\npurpose or intentional volition * * *. It would appear to be\nsufficient to show that discrimination does in fact exist.\"\nId. at 8428 (quoting legal memorandum of the National Association\nof Manufacturers). Congressman Willis also complained that the\nbill went beyond constitutional prohibitions (id. at 1623):\nIf people are being denied equal protection\nof the laws under the 14th amendment or if their\nright to vote is being abridged or denied under\nthe 15th amendment * * * and if that is all you\nwant * * * I would support it. But that is\na far cry from the unlimited provisions of this\nbill.\nSupporters of the bill did not dispute these charges.\nThe debate over the failure of Title VI to include a\ndefinition of discrimination furnishes particularly strong\nevidence that Congress did not want to link Title VI to the\nEqual Protection Clause. Much of the opposition to Title VI\ncentered on its failure to define discrimination. Opponents\nrepeatedly argued that the absence of a definition meant that\neach federal agency would have discretion to determine for\n13/\nitself what constituted discrimination.\nIf Congress had intended to incorporate the equal protec-\ntion standard, the sponsors of the bill would very likely have\n13/ 110 Cong. Rec. 1619 (Rep. Abernathy); id. at 1630 (Rep. Dowdy);\nid. at 9083-9084 (Sen. Gore); id. at 10690 (Sen. Thurmond).\n\n- 19 -\nresponded to these charges with assurances that the agencies would be\nlimited to enforcing the equal protection standard of discrimination.\nBut the supporters of the bill did not want to confine the agencies'\ndiscretion in this way. Instead, they thought it \"wise to leave the\nagencies a good deal of discretion as to how they [would] act.\" 110\n14/\nCong. Rec. 6546 (Sen. Humphrey). (cid:9) Accordingly, they refused to equate\ndiscrimination under Title VI with the standard of equal treatment\nincorporated in the Equal Protection Clause.\nThe legislative history also reflects that in enacting Title VI,\nCongress relied primarily on its spending power and not its power to\nenforce equal protection guarantees. 110 Cong. Rec. 1527, 2467 (Rep.\nCeller); id. at 6546 (Sen. Humphrey); id. at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id.\nat 12675-12677 (Sen. Allott). This reliance on the spending power\nstrongly indicates that Congress intended to do more than simply pro-\nhibit violations of the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, one the goals of Title VI was to eliminate federal\ninvolvement in violations of equal protection guarantees. But there\nis no evidence in the legislative history that this was all Congress\n15/\nintended to accomplish.\n14/ Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy made a similar point in his\nUestimony on the bill. Responding to criticism of the bill's failure\nto define discrimination, he stated (ibid.):\nWe are dealing with a large number of programs,\neach with its own special problems * * *(cid:9) What\nis appropriate for one program may not fit another.\n15/ The statements cited in the Brennan group opinion in Bakke (438\nU.S. at 330-333) all show that eliminating federal involvement in con-\nstitutional violations was one objective of Title VI, not that it was\nthe only objective. Moreover, the cited passages all come from general\nremarks that did not focus on the meaning of discrimination under\nTitle VI. As discussed above, when pressed for a definition of dis-\ncrimination, the sponsors refused to provide one.\n\n- 20 -\nc. De facto segregation\nCongress' treatment of de facto segregation under Title VI\nalso supports the federal agencies' construction of Title VI.\nFrom the beginning, Congress has taken specific steps to insure\nthat in the single area of school segregation, federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI would have no authority to go beyond constitu-\ntional requirements. These measures reflect Congress' awareness\nthat Title VI does not by its own terms express a constitutional\nstandard and that any such limitation would require additional\nlanguage.\nFirst, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6, which provides\nthat \"nothing herein shall enpower any official or court of the\nUnited States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial\nbalance in .any school by requiring the transportation of pupils\nor students from one school to another.\" Although that provision\nwas passed as part of Title IV, the legislative history of\nTitle VI reveals that the word \"herein\" refers to the entire\n16/\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, including Title VI.(cid:9) In 1966, Congress\nadded 42 U.S.C. 2000d-5 which provides that \"compliance * * *\nwith a final [desegregation] order * * * of a Federal court * * *\nshall be deemed to be compliance with [Title VI].\" Finally, in\n1970, Congress amended Title VI to include a provision requiring\nuniformity in the treatment \"of segregation by race, whether de\njure or de facto * * * in all regions of the United States\" and\n16/ 110 Cong. Rec. 12715 (Sen. Humphrey).\n\n- 21 -\nexplained that \"[s]uch uniformity refers to one policy applied\nuniformly to de jure segregation wherever found and such other\npolicy as may be provided pursuant to law applied uniformly to\nde facto segregation wherever found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-6(a),(b).\nThus, Congress was plainly aware that the language of\nTitle VI was broader than the constitutional prohibition against\ndenials of equal protection. When it wanted to confine Title\nVI to constitutional standards, as in the area of school segregation,\nit did so explicitly.\nd. Subsequent legislation\nSince the passage of Title VI, Congress has enacted several\nstatutes modeled on Title VI, including Section 504 of the Rehabili-\ntation Act (29 U.S.C. 794), Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681), the Revenue Sharing Act (31 U.S.C. 1242),\nthe Age Discrimination Act (42 U.S.C. 6106) and the Local Public\nWorks Capital Development and Investment Act (42 U.S.C. 6709).\nEach of these statutes was passed after the federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI had adopted regulations with an effects standard\nand the latter two provisions were passed after the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Lau. If Congress thought that either the agencies\nor the Supreme Court had misconstrued Title VI, it presumably\nwould have taken steps to make sure that such \"mistakes\" would\nnot be repeated in the future. Not only did Congress fail to take\nsuch action, but in some cases it affirmatively indicated that\nthese statutes should be construed in accordance with existing\n\n- 22 -\n17/\ninterpretations of Title VI.(cid:9) This implicit approval of the\nagencies' Title VI regulations significantly undermines WMC's\nclaim that the agencies have misinterpreted Title VI. See\nRed Lion Broadcasting, supra, 395 U.S. at 380-381.\nIn sum, the language of the statute, its history,\namendments to the Act, and subsequent legislation patterned on\nTitle VI all fully support the reasonableness of the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. WMC's invitation to invalidate the\nregulations should be rejected.\n2. The agency regulations are also valid because they are\nreasonably related to the goal of preventing intentional\ndiscrimination\nEven if this Court concludes that the only reasonable\ninterpretation of Title VI is that it incorporates the constitutional\nstandard, that would not end the matter. An agency that has\nbeen delegated rule making power has broad discretion to create\nnew obligations that are not created by the statute itself. The\nonly limitation on this power is that the new obligations must\nbe \"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\"\nMourning v. Family Publications Service, 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973).\nBecause HHS and the other federal agencies enforcing Title VI have\nbeen delegated law making power (see page 14, supra), their regulations\nmust be judged by these standards.\n17/ For example, \"the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed\nthat it would be interpreted and enforced in the same manner as\nTitle VI.\" Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 678\n(1979). And the Public Works Act expressly provides that it\nshould \"be enforced through agency provisions and rules similar\nto those already established, with respect to racial and other\ndiscrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of\n1964.\"(cid:9) 42 U.S.C. 6709.\n\n- 23 -\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Mourning illustrates the\nbreadth of this power. Mourning involved the question whether\na Federal Reserve Board regulation was consistent with the Truth\nin Lending Act. The Act requires the disclosure of certain\ncontract information whenever a finance charge is imposed.\n15 U.S.C. 1631. The regulation goes beyond the Act and requires\ndisclosure whenever a finance charge is imposed or whenever\npayment is to be made in more than four installments. 12 C.F.R.\n226.2(k). The regulation was designed to discourage creditors\nfrom attempting to hide the finance charge in the cash price,\na problem that was felt to be particularly acute in transactions\ninvolving more than four payments.\nAlthough the lower court thought that the regulation was\ninvalid because it included transactions not covered by the Act,\nthe Supreme Court disagreed. The Court specifically explained\nthat (411 U.S. at 374):\nWhere, as here, the transactions or conduct\nwhich Congress seeks to administer occur\nin myriad and changing forms, a require-\nment that a line be drawn which insures\nthat not one blameless individual will\nbe subject to the provisions of an act\nwould unreasonably encumber effective\nadministration and permit many clear\nviolators to escape regulation entirely.\nThe same principle applies here. Even assuming Title VI\nprohibits only acts of intentional discrimination, an agency\nenforcing Title VI is not limited to conducting a case by case\ninquiry into the intent of the recipient. Such an approach\nwould allow many violations to escape detection since even\n\n- 24 -\nunder the best of circumstances, evidence of discriminatory\nintent may be extremely difficult to uncover. An agency may\ntherefore forego a direct inquiry into intent and establish a\nrule that is easier to administer and that reduces the danger\nthat violations will escape detection.\nHHS's regulations serve this function. Under the agency's\nregulations the demand for a proper justification is activated\nby evidence that a practice has a substantially disproportionate\nimpact on a group that has historically been subjected to discrimi-\nnation. Such evidence is often indicative of discriminatory\nintent. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252 (1977). When a recipient is unable to show that\nthe practice is manifestly related to the purposes of the\nprogram receiving assistance, the danger that discrimination is\nbeing practiced increases since normally a recipient will want\nto choose procedures that effectively carry out the purposes\nof its program. Finally, the presence of alternatives that\nwould serve these purposes equally well indicates that the\npurported reason for the practice may be a mask for intentional\ndiscrimination. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405,\n425 (1975). Thus, although the agency regulations do not\nrequire a finding of intentional discrimination, they are well\nadapted to rooting out violations of the Constitution.\n\n- 25 -\nAs in Mourning, it is no objection that the regulations\nwill apply in some situations in which intentional discrimination\nis not being practiced. An agency should be free to adopt\n\"prophylactic measure[s] * * * in order to discourage evasion\"\nof the Act's requirements. Mourning, supra, 411 U.S. at 377.\nCongressional legislation enforcing the Civil Rights\nAmendments strongly supports the reasonableness of the agency's\napproach here. For example, the Voting Rights Act of 1965\nprohibits covered jurisdictions from making any change that\nwill have a disparate effect on minority voters, although the\nFifteenth Amendment may prohibit only intentional discrimination.\nSimilarly, Title VII prohibits public employers from using\nemployment practices with a discriminatory effect, unless\njustified by business necessity, while the Fourteenth Amendment\nprohibits only intentional discrimination. The Supreme Court\nexpressly upheld the Voting Rights Act on the ground that\nCongress could reasonably conclude that changes with a disparate\neffect created a sufficient risk of purposeful discrimination\nto warrant prophylactic relief. City of Rome v. United States,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4463,.4469 (U.S. April 22, 1980). The lower courts\nhave sustained Title VII on similar'grounds. E.g., United States\nv. City of Chicago, 573 F.2d 416, 420-424 (7th Cir. 1978). As\nthe Court's decision in Mourning makes clear, the principle\ninvolved in these cases \"applies to administrative agencies as\nwell as to legislatures.\" 411 U.S. at 374.\n\n- 26 -\nII\nA VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 CAN BE ESTABLISHED\nWITHOUT PROOF OF DISCRIMINATORY INTENT\nWMC also argues that a violation of Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 cannot be established without proof\nof intentional discrimination against handicapped individuals.\nThis argument is incorrect.\nSection 504 provides that\n[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped indivi-\ndual * * * shall, solely by reason of his\nhandicap, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\nThe language of the statute thus prohibits all discrimination against\nqualified handicapped individuals, without limitation. Nothing\nin the language of Section 504 suggests that it reaches only inten-\ntional discrimination.\nMoreover, there is no evidence in the legislative history\nthat Congress was concerned only with intentional discrimination\nagainst the handicapped. To the contrary, the legislative history\nreflects that Congress was aware that intentional discrimination\nwas only a small part of the problem that the handicapped encounter.\nCongress knew that the more widespread and intransigent problem\nwas that decisions had been made, facilities had been constructed\nand programs had been designed without any consideration of the\nhandicapped.\n\n- 27 -\nThus, in a report calling for a White House Conference on\nthe Handicapped, issued the same day as the Senate Report accompany-\ning the 1973 Act, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare\nemphasized that the handicapped suffer not only from intentional\ndiscrimination but also from indifference to their needs. S. Rep.\nNo. 93-319, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973). The report specifically\nexplained that handicapped persons are (id. at 2-3)\nall too often excluded from schools and\neducational programs, barred from employment\nor * * * underemployed because of archaic\nattitudes toward the handicapped, denied\naccess to transportation, buildings and\nhousing because of architectural barriers\nand lack of planning, and * * * discriminated\nagainst by our public laws. * * * Too often\nour programing for, and thinking about, the\nhandicapped fails because of lack of know-\nledge. Too often we find that we automatically\nmake the assumption that nothing can be done.\nThe Senate report accompanying the 1973 Act likewise makes\nclear that Congress' primary concern in enacting Section 504 was\nto insure that handicapped persons would have access to federally\nassisted programs. That report specifically \"proclaims a policy\nof non-discrimination against otherwise qualified handicapped\nindividuals with respect to participation in or access to any\nprogram which is in receipt of Federal financial assistance.\"\nS. Rep. No. 93-318, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 50 (1973).\n\n- 28 -\nConsistent with Congress' overriding concern that\nthe handicapped not be denied access to federally assisted programs,\nHEW, the agency charged with responsibility for coordinating federal\nenforcement of Section 504, adopted regulations that describe the\nnature of the recipients' obligations under Section 504. These\nregulations require recipients to \"operate each program or\nactivity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to handicapped persons.\" 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(a). In addition, the regulations provide specific examples\nof the kinds of modifications recipients must undertake in order to\nmake their programs accessible to the handicapped. 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(b). A recipient may not avoid its obligations under these\nsections by showing that it does not intend to discriminate against\nhandicapped persons. The obligation to insure program accessibility\napplies irrespective of the intent of the recipient. Indeed, in\naddition to the specific requirement of program accessibility, the\nregulations contain a general prohibition against any practice that\nhas \"the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to dis-\ncrimination on the basis of handicap\" or that has \"the purpose or\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of\n\n- 29 -\nthe objectives of the recipient's program.\" 45 C.F.R. 84.4(4).\nThese \nregulations provide an authoritative guide in construing\n18/\nSection 504. See page 14, supra.\nNothing in the Supreme Court's decision in Southeastern\nCommunity College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), undercuts the\nforce of these regulations or indicates that Section 504 reaches\nonly intentional discrimination. To the contrary, the Court\nexpressly relied upon the agency regulations in resolving the\nissue before it and indicated that HEW (now HHS) would have broad\nlatitute to go beyond prohibiting intentional discrimination in\nenforcing Section 504. Id. at 406-407, 412-413.\nIn Davis, a professional nursing school rejected an applicant\nfor its program whose hearing disability prevented her from safely\nparticipating in the clinical part of the program. In holding that\nthe school had not violated Section 504, the Court derived support\nfrom HEW's regulations which provide that an \"otherwise qualified\"\nhandicapped person is one who is able to meet all essential\nqualifications. Id. at 406-407.\n18/ Because the regulations require recipients to make modifica-\ntions that may be costly, HEW submitted them to Congress with an\nexplicit request that Congress evaluate them to make sure that\nintent. \nthey were consistent with congressional  Congress did not\nexpress any disatisfaction with the agency's approach. Instead,\nit sought to assist recipients by assuming some of the costs of\ncompliance. Thus, the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973 include a provision that authorizes grants to state units\nfor the purpose of providing \"such information and technical\nassistance (including support personnel such as interpreters for\nthe deaf) as may be necessary to assist those entities in complying\nwith the Act, particularly the requirements of Section 504.\"\n29 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 775.\n\n- 30 -\nAlthough the applicant argued that HEW's regulations\nrequired the school to modify its program  enable her to \nto  par-\nticipate, the Court concluded that the regulations did not\nmandate the kind of modifications she sought. Thus, the evidence\nin the record indicated that the applicant could safely participate\nin the clinical program only by receiving close individual atten-\ntion from a nursing instructor, yet the regulations exclude such\n\"personalized services\" from the kinds of auxiliary aids a school\nmust provide. Id. at 409.\nThe Court also rejected the suggestion that the college was\nrequired to eliminate clinical training as a prerequisite to\ncompletion of its program. The Court found that a clinical program\nwas an essential part of the curriculum and that without it a\nstudent would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training\na nurse normally receives. Id. at 409-410. The Court held that\nthe agency regulations do not require a recipient to waive such\nessential requirements. Ibid.\nThis does not mean that under Section 504 and the regulations\na recipient may simply adopt a neutral stance and fail to consider\nways to make its program accessible to the handicapped. The Court\nin Davis expressly indicated that recipients must adopt program\nmodifications when that is necessary to prevent discrimination\nagainst the handicapped and that HEW (now HHS) would continue to\nhave a significant role in identifying when \"a refusal to accommodate\n\n- 31 -\nthe needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against\nthe handicapped.\" Id. at 413. Nothing in Davis suggests that\nHHS may require accommodations only in cases of intentional dis-\ncrimination.\nThe Fifth Circuit's recent decision in Camenish v. University\nof \nTexas, 616 F.2d 127 (1980), demonstrates the importance of the\nagency regulations in construing Section 504 and confirms that\nSection 504 does not require proof of discriminatory intent. In\nthat case, the defendant university refused to provide a deaf\ngraduate student with a sign language interpreter. The plaintiff\ndid not claim that the university's refusal to provide an inter-\npreter reflected an intent to exclude handicapped persons from its\nprogram. Indeed, since the university was willing to allow the\nplaintiff to continue in its program if he provided his own inter-\npreter, and would have provided an interpreter itself if plaintiff\nmet the established criteria for financial assistance, any such\nclaim would have been difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, the\ncourt held that the university's failure to provide an interpreter\nviolated Section 504.\nThe University had argued that under Davis, its failure to\nprovide an interpreter could not constitute discrimination under\nSection 504. The Fifth Circuit disagreed. The court pointed out\nthat unlike the situation in Davis, where the applicant was not\n\"otherwise qualified\" because her handicap prevented her from ever\n\n- 32 -\nrealizing the principle benefits of the program, Camenish could\n\"obviously perform well in his profession.\" Id. at 133. More-\nover, the court emphasized that while Davis had sought personalized\nservices not contemplated by the regulations, the interpretive\nservices requested by Camenisch were expressly required by HEW's\nregulation.\nThus, Camenish fully supports the agency's view that a\nrecipient must adopt appropriate modifications to permit participa-\ntion by otherwise qualified handicapped persons and that such\nmodifications must be undertaken, whether or not the recipient's\nfailure to include the handicapped is motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nIn sum, the issue under Section 504 is whether the recipient\nhas taken appropriate steps to make its program accessible to the\nhandicapped. In making this determination, a court should be\nguided by the regulations adopted by HEW. WMC's effort to limit\nthe issue to whether its decisions are infected with an intent to\ndiscriminate against handicapped persons should be rejected.\n\n- 33 -\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court should hold that a violation of Title VI and\nSection 504 can be established without proof of discriminatory\npurpose.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDREW S.

Under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 federal agencies dis-\npensing funds are charged with the responsibility of insuring non-\ndiscrimination in the programs they administer. Specifically, each\nagency is directed \"to effectuate the provisions of [Title VI] * * *\nby issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.\"\nIf recipients fail to comply with these requirements, the responsible\nfederal agency is authorized to secure compliance by terminating\nfinancial assistance or by \"any other means authorized by law.\"\nPursuant to these statutory obligations, virtually all federal agencies\nhave adopted regulations that prohibit recipients from engaging in\npractices that have the effect of discriminating on the ground of\n\n-2-\n1/\nrace, color or national origin.(cid:9) Wilmington Medical Center's (WMC)\nargument (Br. 13 n. 9) that Title VI prohibits only purposeful dis-\ncrimination is inconsistent with this federal position and if\naccepted, could impede effective enforcement of \nTitle VI.\nThe United States also has a substantial interest in the\nresolution of the question whether Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1973 prohibits only intentional discrimination against the\nhandicapped. Executive Order 11914, 3 C.F.R. 117 (1976 Comp.),\nreprinted in 29 U.S.C. 794 note (1976 ed.) directed the Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to issue guidelines for\ndetermining what constitutes discrimination within the meaning\nof Section 504.

The Court's decision\nin this case could affect the validity of these regulations.\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\nThe United States will address the following two questions:\n1. Whether Title VI authorizes federal agencies to adopt\nregulations that prohibit practices which are discriminatory in\neffect, but not in purpose.\n2. Whether a violation of Section 504 can be established\nwithout proof of intentional discrimination.\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the exception of the discussion in the footnote below,\nthe United States' brief addresses only the questions whether\na violation of Title VI and Section 504 can be established without\n2/\nproof of discriminatory intent.(cid:9) Appellants have argued that a\nviolation of these statutes can be established without such proof,\nwhile Wilmington Medical Center (WMC) has argued that such proof is\nessential. We agree with appellants that discriminatory intent is\nnot a necessary element of a cause of action under either Title VI\nor Section 504.\n2/ In deciding that Congress intended to apply a lesser degree of\nscrutiny to actions resulting in age discrimination than to those\nresulting in racial discrimination, the district court relied upon\nthe reference in the original Age Discrimination Act to \"unreason-\nable\" age discrimination. The 1978 amendments to the Act removed\nthe word unreasonable from the Act's statement of purpose. See\n42 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 6101. Accordingly, there is no longer any basis\nfor drawing a distinction between what the Age Discrimination Act\nprohibits and what Title VI and Section 504 prohibit.\n\n-4-\nThe district court held that appellants had failed to\nestablish any violations under either an intent standard or an\nimpact standard. It therefore saw no need to decide which\nstandard was the appropriate one. While appellants have not\nchallenged the district court's conclusion that they failed to\ndemonstrate discriminatory intent, they have attacked many of\nthe predicates for the district court's conclusion that WMC\nwould also prevail under an impact standard. Should this\nCourt agree with one or more of their contentions, it will\nhave to decide whether intent is a necessary element of a\ncause of action under Title VI or Section 504. The purpose of\nthis brief is to assist the Court in resolving those questions.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES'\nTITLE VI REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN EFFECTS\nSTANDARD TO BE APPLIED IN THIS CASE\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d,\nprovides that:\nNo person in the United States shall,\non the ground of race, color, or national\norigin, be excluded from participation in,\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected\nto discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Act also requires federal agencies to issue regulations to\nenforce these prohibitions. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. The Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), the predecessor to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), adopted several such\nregulations. One regulation prohibits recipients from using\n\"criteria or methods of administration which have the effect\nof subjecting individuals to discrimination\" or have \"the\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment\nof the objectives of the program.\" 45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(2). Another\nproscribes site selections that have \"the effect of excluding\nindividuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting\nthem to discrimination under any [federally assisted] programs.\"\n45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(3).\nUnder both of these regulations, the recipient's intent is\nirrelevant. A practice with a disparate effect on a group protected\nby Title VI violates the regulations, unless the recipient can\ndemonstrate that the challenged practice is a \"program necessity.\"\nThis requirement is similar to that imposed by provisions of other\n3/\nCivil Rights statutes and involves a showing that (1) the practice\nsubstantially serves one or more of the purposes of the program\nreceiving federal assistance and that (2) there are no less\n3/ Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) (under Title VII,\nemployment practices with a disproportionate impact must be justified\nby business necessity); Board of Education v. Harris 444 U.S. 130, 151\n(1979) (under the Emergency School Aid Act, faculty assignment practices\nwith a disproportionate impact must be justified by educational neces-\nsity). Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 149 (3d Cir.\n1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978) (under Title VIII, a housing\npractice with a disparate effect must be justified by a showing that it\nsubstantially serves a legitimate interest and that no alternative with\nless discriminatory impact would serve that interest equally well.\n\n-6-\ndiscriminatory alternatives that would serve these purposes\n4/\nequally well.\nBecause HHS's regulations incorporate an \"effects standard\"\nrather than an \"intent standard,\" they may prohibit some practices\nthat would not violate the Constitution. See Washington v. Davis,\n426 U.S. 229 (1976). The question we address is whether Title\nVI authorizes such regulations.\nA. Lau v. Nichols establishes the validity of the Department\nof Health and Human Services' regulations\nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568 (1974), the Supreme\nCourt expressly approved the very regulations at issue in this\ncase as a proper interpretation of Title VI and held that under\nTitle VI \"discrimination is barred which has that effect even\n4/ The district court held that WMC had the burden of producing\nevidence but not the burden of persuasion on the issue of program\nnecessity. This holding is incorrect. While the district court\nproperly turned to Title VII for guidance in resolving the issue,\nit failed to recognize that there are two kinds of Title VII\ncases, disparate treatment cases and disproportionate impact\ncases. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15\n(1977). Disparate treatment cases involve claims that an\nemployer treats some people less favorably than others because\nof a personal characteristic such as race. In such cases,\nproof of discriminatory intent is critical. Disproportionate\nimpact cases involve claims that an employment practice, though\nfacially neutral, has a disproportionate impact on a group\nprotected by Title VII and is not justified by business necessity.\nIn these cases, proof of discriminatory intent is not required.\nIn a disparate treatment case, once a prima facie case is shown,\nthe employer need only produce evidence of a non-discriminatory\nreason for its decision. In a disproportionate impact case,\nhowever, the employer has the burden of persuasion on the\nissue of business necessity. Vulcan v. Civil Service Commission,\n490 F.2d 387, 393 (2d Cir. 1973). Because program necessity\nis a justification for a practice that would otherwise violate\nTitle VI and not evidence designed to rebut an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent, the appropriate Title VII analogy is to\nthe disproportionate impact cases, rather than the disparate\ntreatment cases relied upon by the district court. Thus, under\nTitle VI, the recipient has the burden of persuasion and not merely\nthe burden of producing evidence on the issue of program necessity.\n\n- 7 -\n5 /\nthough no purposeful design is present.\" The Court stated that\nTitle VI was an exercise of Congress' power \"to fix the terms\nupon which its money allotments to the State shall be disbursed\"\nand concluded that \"[w]hatever may be the limits of that power,\n* * * they have not been reached here.\" Id. at 569. Lau's\ninterpretation of Title VI is binding on this Court and should\nbe followed in this case.\nWithout any discussion of Lau, Wilmington Medical Center\nasserts that a violation of Title VI cannot be established\nwithout proof of discriminatory purpose. It relies almost exclu-\nsively on the Supreme Court's decisions in Regents of the University\nof California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) and Board of Education\n6/\nv. Harris, 444 U.S. 130 (1979) to support this assertion (cid:9) WMC's\nreliance on Bakke and Harris is misplaced.\nBakke did not purport to overrule Lau; indeed, all nine\njustices cited Lau with approval. 438 U.S. at 303-304 (Powell, J.);\nid. at 342, 350-353 (Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun, JJ.);\nid. at 416-417 and n. 20 (Stevens, J.) Nor is the holding in Bakke\ninconsistent with the holding in Lau.\nBakke involved a medical school admission program that\ncreated an explicit preference for members of certain racial\ngroups.(cid:9) The defendant university did not deny that it intended\n5/ The Court specifically held that a school district's failure\nto attempt to rectify the language deficiency of Chinese speaking\nchildren violated Title VI, even though the school board's failure\nto offer remedial instruction was not motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\n6 /The only other decision relied upon by WMC is Guardians v. Civil\nService Commission, 23 Empl. Prac. Dec. 11 31,153 (D.C. N.Y. 1980)\n(petition for rehearing pending). In that case two district court\njudges sitting by designation concluded that Bakke had overruled Lau.\nFor the reasons discussed above, that conclusion is incorrect and\nshould not be followed.\n\nto treat minority applicants more favorably than white applicants.\nInstead, it sought to justity this preference as a remedy for\npast discrimination.\nAccordingly, the only Title VI issue in Bakke was whether\nTitle VI prohibits all explicit racial preferences, including those\nintended to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Four\njustices interpreted Title VI as a per se ban on all racial\npreferences, regardless of what the Constitution would permit.\nIt was in response to this contention that a majority of the Court\nheld that Title VI permits an explicit use of race so long as\nit is consistent with the Constitution. Mr. Justice Powell stated\nthat \"Title VI must be held to proscribe only those racial class-\nifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the\nFifth Amendment.\" Id. at 287 (emphasis added). And the four\njustices in the Brennan group agreed that \"Title VI goes no further\nin prohibiting the use of race than the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment itself.\" Id. at 325 (emphasis added).\nThus, Bakke involved only the question whether a purposeful\nacknowledged use of race could be justified under Title VI.\nBecause the university conceded that its resort to race was\ndeliberate, the question whether a violation could be established\nwithout proof of such intentional discrimination was not at\nissue. In this situation, Lau continues to state the governing\nprinciple -- practices with a discriminatory effect are pro-\nhibited \"even though no purposeful design is present.\" 414 U.S.\nat 568.\n\n-9-\nWe recognize that the Brennan group appears to have con-\ncluded that Title VI is absolutely coextensive with the Constitution\nand that Lau therefore may have been incorrectly decided. 438 U.S.\nat 352. But the Brennan group also sought to reconcile their\ndecision with Lau. Independent of their conclusion that Title VI\nshould always be interpreted like the Constitution, the Brennan\ngroup rejected a color blind interpretation of Title VI because\nit would be inconsistent with Congress' expressed purpose of\nending the legacy of discrimination against blacks and other\nhistorically disadvantaged groups. Id. at 340, 353, 355.\nAs they put it, a statute \"designed to eliminate discrimination\nagainst racial minorities\" should not be interpreted \"in a\nmanner which would impede efforts to obtain this objective.\"\n7/\nId. at 355.\nMoreover, the fact that some justices have expressed\ndoubts about a decision \"does not make it any less binding upon\n[this Court].\" United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 450\nF.2d 232, 239 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1063 (1972).\nThis Court is simply \"not free to disregard an existing fiat and\nstill live holding of the Supreme Court.\" Ashe v. Swenson, 399 F.2d\n40, 45 (8th Cir. 1968), reversed on other grounds, 397 U.S. 436.\n7 / The Supreme Court applied precisely this principle in holding\nthat Title VII does not prohibit all race conscious affirmative\naction plans. United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 201-202\n(1979).\n\n- 10 -\nHarris did not involve a question under Title VI at all.\nThat case concerned the proper construction of the Emergency\nSchool Aid Act (ESAA), a statute that makes federal aid available\nto local school districts that undertake efforts to reduce\nminority group isolation. The particular provision under\nreview prohibited \"discrimination\" in the assignment of faculty.\nThe Court held that this provision prohibits school districts\nfrom maintaining racially segregated faculties, even if the\nsegregation is not intentional.\nTitle VI was introduced into the case by the school\ndistrict, which argued that Title VI has an intent standard and\nthat ESAA should be interpreted like Title VI. The Court\nspecifically declined to resolve the question of the standard\nof liability under Title VI, however, because it found no\nevidence \"that the two Acts were intended to be coextensive.\"\n444 U.S. at 149.\nThe Court in Harris did not even mention Lau, much less\noverrule it. And the Court's careful reservation of the question\nof the appropriate standard of liability under Title VI makes clear\nthat Bakke did not overrule Lau either.\nWMC's view that Harris supports an intent standard under Title\nVI apparently comes from the Court's observation that (id. at\n150):\n\n- 11 -\nIt does make sense * * * that Congress\nmight impose a stricter standard under\nESAA than under Title VI * * *. A\nviolation of Title VI may result in a\ncut off of all federal funds and it is\nlikely that Congress would wish this\ndrastic result only when the discrimination\nis intentional.\nThis Court should not be guided by this statement for several\nreasons.\nFirst, it is apparent from the Court's brief discussion\nthat it merely presumed that the availability of the fund\ntermination remedy might have prompted Congress to adopt an\nintent standard; the Court did not actually investigate the\n8/\nquestion.\nA careful review of the legislative history leads to\na different conclusion. Thus, opponents of the bill repeatedly\nargued that the fund termination remedy was too drastic and\nthat Title VI showed be defeated for this reason alone. The\n8/(cid:9) Indeed, the only basis for the Court's presumption was\nthat a violation of Title VI would result in a cut off of all\nfederal funds. However, fund termination must \"be limited in\nits effect to a particular program, or part thereof * * *\n[where] noncompliance has been so found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\nSince fund termination under Title VI must be program specific,\nit is arguably no more drastic than a refusal to fund a project\nunder ESAA.\n\n- 12 -\nproponents of the bill did not respond to these attacks with\nassurances that Title VI would only be applied in cases of\nracial animus, however. Instead, they emphasized that the\nstrict procedural safeguards built into Title VI would provide\nadequate protection against the possibility that funds would be\n9/\nterminated without \nsufficient justification.—(cid:9)The logical inference\nis that Congress sought to ameliorate the harshness of the fund\ntermination remedy by guaranteeing procedural fairness and not by\nlimiting Title VI to instances of intentional discrimination.\n9(cid:9) 110 Cong. Rec. 6749 (Sen. Moss); id. at 6544 (Sen. Humphrey);\nI. at 1519 (Rep. Celler); id. at 7066-7067 (Sen. Ribicoff);\nid. at 8345 (Sen. Proxmire); id. at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel).\nSenator Moss pointed out that before federal funds are withdrawn,\n(110 Cong. Rec. 6749):\n[R]egulations giving notice of what conduct\nis required must be drawn up by the agency\nadministering the program. * * * Before such\nregulations become effective, they must\nbe submitted to and approved by the President.\nOnce having become effective, there\nis still a long road to travel before any\nsanction whatsoever is imposed. Formal\naction to compel compliance can only take\nplace after the following has occurred:\nfirst, there must be an unsuccessful attempt\nto obtain voluntary compliance; second, there\nmust be an administrative hearing; third,\na written report of the circumstances and\nthe grounds for such action must be filed\nwith the appropriate committees of the\nHouse and Senate; and fourth, 30 days\nmust have elapsed between such filing and\nthe action denying benefits under a\nFederal program. Finally, even that\n(continued)\n\n- 13 -\nSecond, the dictum in Harris addresses the issue of the\nTitle VI standard only as it applies to fund terminations, while\nthis suit is one for injunctive relief. While we believe that\nproof of intentional discrimination is not required to make out a\nviolation of Title VI in any type of enforcement action, \none\ncourt of appeals has suggested that the dicta in Harris may be\ncompletely inapplicable in suits for injunctive relief. Bryan v.\nKoch, Nos. 80-6085, 80-7401 (2d Cir., July 10, 1980).\nFinally, this Court's obligation is to follow the law as\nit currently stands, regardless of how the Supreme Court may\nultimately decide the issue. Because neither Bakke nor Harris\noverruled Lau, it remains good law and this Court has no authority\n10/\nto disregard it\n / (continued)\naction is by no means final because\nit is subject to judicial review and can\nbe further postponed by judicial action\ngranting temporary relief pending review\nin order to avoid irreparable injury. It\nwould be difficult indeed to concoct any\nadditional safeguards.\nThese procedures are found in 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\n10/ The Supreme Court's recent decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4979 (U.S. July 2, 1980), confirms the propriety of\nfollowing Supreme Court precedent rather than attempting to\npredict how various justices will decide an issue when it\nfinally comes before them. There, the plurality opinion cited\nLau with approval, although two of the justices joining the\nopinion had previously questioned it. Id. at 4987-4988.\n\n- 14 -\nB. The regulations at issue in this case are authorized\nby Title VI\n1. The administrative interpretation of Title VI\nis reasonable\nWe believe that this Court is not free to reexamine Lau.\nHowever, because this Court may disagree, we now address the\nvalidity of the Title VI regulations at issue. In arguing\nthat the regulations are invalid, WMC ignores the critical\npoint that the interpretation of a statute by those charged\nwith its enforcement \"is entitled to great deference,\" and\nshould be followed \"unless these are compelling indications it\nis wrong.\" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434\n(1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965); Red Lion Broad-\ncasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969). This principle\napplies with even greater force here because Congress has\ndelegated HHS and other federal agencies the task of formulating\nlegislative regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.\n11/\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141 (1976). In\nthis situation, the agency's interpretation of the statute\nmust be followed unless it is \"demonstrably irrational.\"\nFord Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 48 U.S.L.W. 4145, 4148\n(U.S. Feb. 20, 1980).\nUnder Title VI, agencies are \"directed to effectuate the\nprovisions of section 2000d * * * by issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. Because\nthe statute expressly provides that non-compliance with the reg-\nulations may lead directly to sanctions (ibid.), the regulations\nare properly classified as legislative rather than merely\ninterpretive. Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S. at 141-142; Chrysler\nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301-302 (1979); see generally,\nK.C. Davis, Administrative Law § 5.03 (3d ed. 1972).\n\n- 15 -\nTo be sure, in some circumstances it is appropriate to\nattach less weight than usual to an agency's interpretation of\na statute. But there is no basis for departing from the usual\nrule here.\nThus, this is not a case where the agency's interpretation\nwas formulated long after passage of the Act. Gilbert, supra, 429\nU.S. at *142. The regulations at issue in this case were first\nadopted in 1964, only several months after Title VI became\neffective. Such contemporaneous regulations are a particularly\nreliable indication of the meaning of the Act. Udall v. Tallman,\nsupra, 380 U.S. at 16; Power Reactor Co. v. Electricians, 367\nU.S. 396, 408 (1961).\nNor is this a case where the administrative interpretation\nis entitled to less weight than usual because it \"conflict[s]\nwith earlier pronouncements of the agency.\" Gilbert, supra,\n429 U.S. at 143; Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 93-\n94 (1973). HHS and its predecessor, HEW, have consistently\ninterpreted the Act as prohibiting acts with a discriminatory\neffect.\nFinally, this is not a case where the agencies enforcing\nthe statute are divided on the proper interpretation of the\nstatute and the principle of agency deference therefore points\n\"in diametrically opposite directions.\" Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S.\nat 145. To the contrary, at least twenty-five federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI have adopted regulations that prohibit\npractices with a discriminatory effect. See note 1, supra.\n\n- 16 -\nAccordingly, the issue is whether this federal position\nis \"demonstrably irrational.\" Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin,\nsupra, 48 U.S.L.W. at 4148. is we demonstrate below, the inter-\npretation of Title VI adopted by the federal agencies is not only\na rational one, but it is the one that is most consistent with\nthe language of the statute and its legislative history.\na. The language of the statute\nThe argument that Title VI was intended to be absolutely\ncoextensive with the Equal Protection Clause and that it\ntherefore prohibits only intentional discrimination is not\nsupported by the language of the statute. The statute\ndoes not protect beneficiaries of federally assisted programs\nagainst \"denials of equal protection.\" Instead, the statutory\nterms provide that no person is to be \"excluded from,\" \"denied\nthe benefits of\" or \"subjected to discrimination under\" any\nfederal program. If Congress had the limited objective of\nprohibiting denials of equal protection and nothing more, it\npresumably would have used equal protection language.\nA comparison between the language of Title VI and other\ntitles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 strongly supports this\nconclusion. Title III of the Act protects an individual from\nbeing \"deprived of * * * his right to the equal protection of the\nlaws * * * by being denied equal utilization of any public\nfacility.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000b. And Title IV of the same Act\nprotects a minor child from \"being deprived by a school board\nof the equal protection of the laws.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6.\n\n- 17 -\nThus, when Congress wanted to incorporate equal protection\nstandards, it used equal protection language. The far more\nexpansive language in Title VI is strong evidence that Congress\ndid not intend to link Title VI to the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\nh. Legislative history\nThe legislative history of Title VI supports the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. Thus, President Kennedy, in his\nmessage to Congress proposing the legislation that ultimately\nbecame Title VI, outlined the broad objectives of the proposal\n(109 Cong. Rec. 1161 (1964))(emphasis added):\nSimple justice requires that public funds,\nto which all taxpayers contribute, not be\nspent in any fashion which encourages,\nentrenches, subsidizes or results in racial\ndiscrimination.\nSenator Humphrey repeated President Kennedy's message in his\nspeech opening the debate on Title VI. 110 Cong. Rec. 6543.\nAnd the statements of other proponents also reflect that Congress\nwas concerned with results of recipients' practices and not simply the\n12/\nmotivation.\n12/ 110 Cong. Rec. 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id. at 2484 (Rep. O'Hara);\nid. at 1519 (Rep. Celler).\n\n- 18 -\nThis emphasis on eliminating discriminatory results\nregardless of motivation was not lost on opponents of the bill.\nFor example, Congressman Robertson complained that under Title VI,\nas under Title VII, \"it would not be necessary to show any willful\npurpose or intentional volition * * *. It would appear to be\nsufficient to show that discrimination does in fact exist.\"\nId. at 8428 (quoting legal memorandum of the National Association\nof Manufacturers). Congressman Willis also complained that the\nbill went beyond constitutional prohibitions (id. at 1623):\nIf people are being denied equal protection\nof the laws under the 14th amendment or if their\nright to vote is being abridged or denied under\nthe 15th amendment * * * and if that is all you\nwant * * * I would support it. But that is\na far cry from the unlimited provisions of this\nbill.\nSupporters of the bill did not dispute these charges.\nThe debate over the failure of Title VI to include a\ndefinition of discrimination furnishes particularly strong\nevidence that Congress did not want to link Title VI to the\nEqual Protection Clause. Much of the opposition to Title VI\ncentered on its failure to define discrimination. Opponents\nrepeatedly argued that the absence of a definition meant that\neach federal agency would have discretion to determine for\n13/\nitself what constituted discrimination.\nIf Congress had intended to incorporate the equal protec-\ntion standard, the sponsors of the bill would very likely have\n13/ 110 Cong. Rec. 1619 (Rep. Abernathy); id. at 1630 (Rep. Dowdy);\nid. at 9083-9084 (Sen. Gore); id. at 10690 (Sen. Thurmond).\n\n- 19 -\nresponded to these charges with assurances that the agencies would be\nlimited to enforcing the equal protection standard of discrimination.\nBut the supporters of the bill did not want to confine the agencies'\ndiscretion in this way. Instead, they thought it \"wise to leave the\nagencies a good deal of discretion as to how they [would] act.\" 110\n14/\nCong. Rec. 6546 (Sen. Humphrey). (cid:9) Accordingly, they refused to equate\ndiscrimination under Title VI with the standard of equal treatment\nincorporated in the Equal Protection Clause.\nThe legislative history also reflects that in enacting Title VI,\nCongress relied primarily on its spending power and not its power to\nenforce equal protection guarantees. 110 Cong. Rec. 1527, 2467 (Rep.\nCeller); id. at 6546 (Sen. Humphrey); id. at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id.\nat 12675-12677 (Sen. Allott). This reliance on the spending power\nstrongly indicates that Congress intended to do more than simply pro-\nhibit violations of the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, one the goals of Title VI was to eliminate federal\ninvolvement in violations of equal protection guarantees. But there\nis no evidence in the legislative history that this was all Congress\n15/\nintended to accomplish.\n14/ Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy made a similar point in his\nUestimony on the bill. Responding to criticism of the bill's failure\nto define discrimination, he stated (ibid.):\nWe are dealing with a large number of programs,\neach with its own special problems * * *(cid:9) What\nis appropriate for one program may not fit another.\n15/ The statements cited in the Brennan group opinion in Bakke (438\nU.S. at 330-333) all show that eliminating federal involvement in con-\nstitutional violations was one objective of Title VI, not that it was\nthe only objective. Moreover, the cited passages all come from general\nremarks that did not focus on the meaning of discrimination under\nTitle VI. As discussed above, when pressed for a definition of dis-\ncrimination, the sponsors refused to provide one.\n\n- 20 -\nc. De facto segregation\nCongress' treatment of de facto segregation under Title VI\nalso supports the federal agencies' construction of Title VI.\nFrom the beginning, Congress has taken specific steps to insure\nthat in the single area of school segregation, federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI would have no authority to go beyond constitu-\ntional requirements. These measures reflect Congress' awareness\nthat Title VI does not by its own terms express a constitutional\nstandard and that any such limitation would require additional\nlanguage.\nFirst, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6, which provides\nthat \"nothing herein shall enpower any official or court of the\nUnited States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial\nbalance in .any school by requiring the transportation of pupils\nor students from one school to another.\" Although that provision\nwas passed as part of Title IV, the legislative history of\nTitle VI reveals that the word \"herein\" refers to the entire\n16/\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, including Title VI.(cid:9) In 1966, Congress\nadded 42 U.S.C. 2000d-5 which provides that \"compliance * * *\nwith a final [desegregation] order * * * of a Federal court * * *\nshall be deemed to be compliance with [Title VI].\" Finally, in\n1970, Congress amended Title VI to include a provision requiring\nuniformity in the treatment \"of segregation by race, whether de\njure or de facto * * * in all regions of the United States\" and\n16/ 110 Cong. Rec. 12715 (Sen. Humphrey).\n\n- 21 -\nexplained that \"[s]uch uniformity refers to one policy applied\nuniformly to de jure segregation wherever found and such other\npolicy as may be provided pursuant to law applied uniformly to\nde facto segregation wherever found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-6(a),(b).\nThus, Congress was plainly aware that the language of\nTitle VI was broader than the constitutional prohibition against\ndenials of equal protection. When it wanted to confine Title\nVI to constitutional standards, as in the area of school segregation,\nit did so explicitly.\nd. Subsequent legislation\nSince the passage of Title VI, Congress has enacted several\nstatutes modeled on Title VI, including Section 504 of the Rehabili-\ntation Act (29 U.S.C. 794), Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681), the Revenue Sharing Act (31 U.S.C. 1242),\nthe Age Discrimination Act (42 U.S.C. 6106) and the Local Public\nWorks Capital Development and Investment Act (42 U.S.C. 6709).\nEach of these statutes was passed after the federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI had adopted regulations with an effects standard\nand the latter two provisions were passed after the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Lau. If Congress thought that either the agencies\nor the Supreme Court had misconstrued Title VI, it presumably\nwould have taken steps to make sure that such \"mistakes\" would\nnot be repeated in the future. Not only did Congress fail to take\nsuch action, but in some cases it affirmatively indicated that\nthese statutes should be construed in accordance with existing\n\n- 22 -\n17/\ninterpretations of Title VI.(cid:9) This implicit approval of the\nagencies' Title VI regulations significantly undermines WMC's\nclaim that the agencies have misinterpreted Title VI. See\nRed Lion Broadcasting, supra, 395 U.S. at 380-381.\nIn sum, the language of the statute, its history,\namendments to the Act, and subsequent legislation patterned on\nTitle VI all fully support the reasonableness of the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. WMC's invitation to invalidate the\nregulations should be rejected.\n2. The agency regulations are also valid because they are\nreasonably related to the goal of preventing intentional\ndiscrimination\nEven if this Court concludes that the only reasonable\ninterpretation of Title VI is that it incorporates the constitutional\nstandard, that would not end the matter. An agency that has\nbeen delegated rule making power has broad discretion to create\nnew obligations that are not created by the statute itself. The\nonly limitation on this power is that the new obligations must\nbe \"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\"\nMourning v. Family Publications Service, 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973).\nBecause HHS and the other federal agencies enforcing Title VI have\nbeen delegated law making power (see page 14, supra), their regulations\nmust be judged by these standards.\n17/ For example, \"the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed\nthat it would be interpreted and enforced in the same manner as\nTitle VI.\" Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 678\n(1979). And the Public Works Act expressly provides that it\nshould \"be enforced through agency provisions and rules similar\nto those already established, with respect to racial and other\ndiscrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of\n1964.\"(cid:9) 42 U.S.C. 6709.\n\n- 23 -\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Mourning illustrates the\nbreadth of this power. Mourning involved the question whether\na Federal Reserve Board regulation was consistent with the Truth\nin Lending Act. The Act requires the disclosure of certain\ncontract information whenever a finance charge is imposed.\n15 U.S.C. 1631. The regulation goes beyond the Act and requires\ndisclosure whenever a finance charge is imposed or whenever\npayment is to be made in more than four installments. 12 C.F.R.\n226.2(k). The regulation was designed to discourage creditors\nfrom attempting to hide the finance charge in the cash price,\na problem that was felt to be particularly acute in transactions\ninvolving more than four payments.\nAlthough the lower court thought that the regulation was\ninvalid because it included transactions not covered by the Act,\nthe Supreme Court disagreed. The Court specifically explained\nthat (411 U.S. at 374):\nWhere, as here, the transactions or conduct\nwhich Congress seeks to administer occur\nin myriad and changing forms, a require-\nment that a line be drawn which insures\nthat not one blameless individual will\nbe subject to the provisions of an act\nwould unreasonably encumber effective\nadministration and permit many clear\nviolators to escape regulation entirely.\nThe same principle applies here. Even assuming Title VI\nprohibits only acts of intentional discrimination, an agency\nenforcing Title VI is not limited to conducting a case by case\ninquiry into the intent of the recipient. Such an approach\nwould allow many violations to escape detection since even\n\n- 24 -\nunder the best of circumstances, evidence of discriminatory\nintent may be extremely difficult to uncover. An agency may\ntherefore forego a direct inquiry into intent and establish a\nrule that is easier to administer and that reduces the danger\nthat violations will escape detection.\nHHS's regulations serve this function. Under the agency's\nregulations the demand for a proper justification is activated\nby evidence that a practice has a substantially disproportionate\nimpact on a group that has historically been subjected to discrimi-\nnation. Such evidence is often indicative of discriminatory\nintent. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252 (1977). When a recipient is unable to show that\nthe practice is manifestly related to the purposes of the\nprogram receiving assistance, the danger that discrimination is\nbeing practiced increases since normally a recipient will want\nto choose procedures that effectively carry out the purposes\nof its program. Finally, the presence of alternatives that\nwould serve these purposes equally well indicates that the\npurported reason for the practice may be a mask for intentional\ndiscrimination. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405,\n425 (1975). Thus, although the agency regulations do not\nrequire a finding of intentional discrimination, they are well\nadapted to rooting out violations of the Constitution.\n\n- 25 -\nAs in Mourning, it is no objection that the regulations\nwill apply in some situations in which intentional discrimination\nis not being practiced. An agency should be free to adopt\n\"prophylactic measure[s] * * * in order to discourage evasion\"\nof the Act's requirements. Mourning, supra, 411 U.S. at 377.\nCongressional legislation enforcing the Civil Rights\nAmendments strongly supports the reasonableness of the agency's\napproach here. For example, the Voting Rights Act of 1965\nprohibits covered jurisdictions from making any change that\nwill have a disparate effect on minority voters, although the\nFifteenth Amendment may prohibit only intentional discrimination.\nSimilarly, Title VII prohibits public employers from using\nemployment practices with a discriminatory effect, unless\njustified by business necessity, while the Fourteenth Amendment\nprohibits only intentional discrimination. The Supreme Court\nexpressly upheld the Voting Rights Act on the ground that\nCongress could reasonably conclude that changes with a disparate\neffect created a sufficient risk of purposeful discrimination\nto warrant prophylactic relief. City of Rome v. United States,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4463,.4469 (U.S. April 22, 1980). The lower courts\nhave sustained Title VII on similar'grounds. E.g., United States\nv. City of Chicago, 573 F.2d 416, 420-424 (7th Cir. 1978). As\nthe Court's decision in Mourning makes clear, the principle\ninvolved in these cases \"applies to administrative agencies as\nwell as to legislatures.\" 411 U.S. at 374.\n\n- 26 -\nII\nA VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 CAN BE ESTABLISHED\nWITHOUT PROOF OF DISCRIMINATORY INTENT\nWMC also argues that a violation of Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 cannot be established without proof\nof intentional discrimination against handicapped individuals.\nThis argument is incorrect.\nSection 504 provides that\n[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped indivi-\ndual * * * shall, solely by reason of his\nhandicap, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\nThe language of the statute thus prohibits all discrimination against\nqualified handicapped individuals, without limitation. Nothing\nin the language of Section 504 suggests that it reaches only inten-\ntional discrimination.\nMoreover, there is no evidence in the legislative history\nthat Congress was concerned only with intentional discrimination\nagainst the handicapped. To the contrary, the legislative history\nreflects that Congress was aware that intentional discrimination\nwas only a small part of the problem that the handicapped encounter.\nCongress knew that the more widespread and intransigent problem\nwas that decisions had been made, facilities had been constructed\nand programs had been designed without any consideration of the\nhandicapped.\n\n- 27 -\nThus, in a report calling for a White House Conference on\nthe Handicapped, issued the same day as the Senate Report accompany-\ning the 1973 Act, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare\nemphasized that the handicapped suffer not only from intentional\ndiscrimination but also from indifference to their needs. S. Rep.\nNo. 93-319, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973). The report specifically\nexplained that handicapped persons are (id. at 2-3)\nall too often excluded from schools and\neducational programs, barred from employment\nor * * * underemployed because of archaic\nattitudes toward the handicapped, denied\naccess to transportation, buildings and\nhousing because of architectural barriers\nand lack of planning, and * * * discriminated\nagainst by our public laws. * * * Too often\nour programing for, and thinking about, the\nhandicapped fails because of lack of know-\nledge. Too often we find that we automatically\nmake the assumption that nothing can be done.\nThe Senate report accompanying the 1973 Act likewise makes\nclear that Congress' primary concern in enacting Section 504 was\nto insure that handicapped persons would have access to federally\nassisted programs. That report specifically \"proclaims a policy\nof non-discrimination against otherwise qualified handicapped\nindividuals with respect to participation in or access to any\nprogram which is in receipt of Federal financial assistance.\"\nS. Rep. No. 93-318, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 50 (1973).\n\n- 28 -\nConsistent with Congress' overriding concern that\nthe handicapped not be denied access to federally assisted programs,\nHEW, the agency charged with responsibility for coordinating federal\nenforcement of Section 504, adopted regulations that describe the\nnature of the recipients' obligations under Section 504. These\nregulations require recipients to \"operate each program or\nactivity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to handicapped persons.\" 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(a). In addition, the regulations provide specific examples\nof the kinds of modifications recipients must undertake in order to\nmake their programs accessible to the handicapped. 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(b). A recipient may not avoid its obligations under these\nsections by showing that it does not intend to discriminate against\nhandicapped persons. The obligation to insure program accessibility\napplies irrespective of the intent of the recipient. Indeed, in\naddition to the specific requirement of program accessibility, the\nregulations contain a general prohibition against any practice that\nhas \"the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to dis-\ncrimination on the basis of handicap\" or that has \"the purpose or\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of\n\n- 29 -\nthe objectives of the recipient's program.\" 45 C.F.R. 84.4(4).\nThese \nregulations provide an authoritative guide in construing\n18/\nSection 504. See page 14, supra.\nNothing in the Supreme Court's decision in Southeastern\nCommunity College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), undercuts the\nforce of these regulations or indicates that Section 504 reaches\nonly intentional discrimination. To the contrary, the Court\nexpressly relied upon the agency regulations in resolving the\nissue before it and indicated that HEW (now HHS) would have broad\nlatitute to go beyond prohibiting intentional discrimination in\nenforcing Section 504. Id. at 406-407, 412-413.\nIn Davis, a professional nursing school rejected an applicant\nfor its program whose hearing disability prevented her from safely\nparticipating in the clinical part of the program. In holding that\nthe school had not violated Section 504, the Court derived support\nfrom HEW's regulations which provide that an \"otherwise qualified\"\nhandicapped person is one who is able to meet all essential\nqualifications. Id. at 406-407.\n18/ Because the regulations require recipients to make modifica-\ntions that may be costly, HEW submitted them to Congress with an\nexplicit request that Congress evaluate them to make sure that\nintent. \nthey were consistent with congressional  Congress did not\nexpress any disatisfaction with the agency's approach. Instead,\nit sought to assist recipients by assuming some of the costs of\ncompliance. Thus, the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973 include a provision that authorizes grants to state units\nfor the purpose of providing \"such information and technical\nassistance (including support personnel such as interpreters for\nthe deaf) as may be necessary to assist those entities in complying\nwith the Act, particularly the requirements of Section 504.\"\n29 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 775.\n\n- 30 -\nAlthough the applicant argued that HEW's regulations\nrequired the school to modify its program  enable her to \nto  par-\nticipate, the Court concluded that the regulations did not\nmandate the kind of modifications she sought. Thus, the evidence\nin the record indicated that the applicant could safely participate\nin the clinical program only by receiving close individual atten-\ntion from a nursing instructor, yet the regulations exclude such\n\"personalized services\" from the kinds of auxiliary aids a school\nmust provide. Id. at 409.\nThe Court also rejected the suggestion that the college was\nrequired to eliminate clinical training as a prerequisite to\ncompletion of its program. The Court found that a clinical program\nwas an essential part of the curriculum and that without it a\nstudent would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training\na nurse normally receives. Id. at 409-410. The Court held that\nthe agency regulations do not require a recipient to waive such\nessential requirements. Ibid.\nThis does not mean that under Section 504 and the regulations\na recipient may simply adopt a neutral stance and fail to consider\nways to make its program accessible to the handicapped. The Court\nin Davis expressly indicated that recipients must adopt program\nmodifications when that is necessary to prevent discrimination\nagainst the handicapped and that HEW (now HHS) would continue to\nhave a significant role in identifying when \"a refusal to accommodate\n\n- 31 -\nthe needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against\nthe handicapped.\" Id. at 413. Nothing in Davis suggests that\nHHS may require accommodations only in cases of intentional dis-\ncrimination.\nThe Fifth Circuit's recent decision in Camenish v. University\nof \nTexas, 616 F.2d 127 (1980), demonstrates the importance of the\nagency regulations in construing Section 504 and confirms that\nSection 504 does not require proof of discriminatory intent. In\nthat case, the defendant university refused to provide a deaf\ngraduate student with a sign language interpreter. The plaintiff\ndid not claim that the university's refusal to provide an inter-\npreter reflected an intent to exclude handicapped persons from its\nprogram. Indeed, since the university was willing to allow the\nplaintiff to continue in its program if he provided his own inter-\npreter, and would have provided an interpreter itself if plaintiff\nmet the established criteria for financial assistance, any such\nclaim would have been difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, the\ncourt held that the university's failure to provide an interpreter\nviolated Section 504.\nThe University had argued that under Davis, its failure to\nprovide an interpreter could not constitute discrimination under\nSection 504. The Fifth Circuit disagreed. The court pointed out\nthat unlike the situation in Davis, where the applicant was not\n\"otherwise qualified\" because her handicap prevented her from ever\n\n- 32 -\nrealizing the principle benefits of the program, Camenish could\n\"obviously perform well in his profession.\" Id. at 133. More-\nover, the court emphasized that while Davis had sought personalized\nservices not contemplated by the regulations, the interpretive\nservices requested by Camenisch were expressly required by HEW's\nregulation.\nThus, Camenish fully supports the agency's view that a\nrecipient must adopt appropriate modifications to permit participa-\ntion by otherwise qualified handicapped persons and that such\nmodifications must be undertaken, whether or not the recipient's\nfailure to include the handicapped is motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nIn sum, the issue under Section 504 is whether the recipient\nhas taken appropriate steps to make its program accessible to the\nhandicapped. In making this determination, a court should be\nguided by the regulations adopted by HEW. WMC's effort to limit\nthe issue to whether its decisions are infected with an intent to\ndiscriminate against handicapped persons should be rejected.\n\n- 33 -\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court should hold that a violation of Title VI and\nSection 504 can be established without proof of discriminatory\npurpose.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDREW S.

Under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 federal agencies dis-\npensing funds are charged with the responsibility of insuring non-\ndiscrimination in the programs they administer. Specifically, each\nagency is directed \"to effectuate the provisions of [Title VI] * * *\nby issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.\"\nIf recipients fail to comply with these requirements, the responsible\nfederal agency is authorized to secure compliance by terminating\nfinancial assistance or by \"any other means authorized by law.\"\nPursuant to these statutory obligations, virtually all federal agencies\nhave adopted regulations that prohibit recipients from engaging in\npractices that have the effect of discriminating on the ground of\n\n-2-\n1/\nrace, color or national origin.(cid:9) Wilmington Medical Center's (WMC)\nargument (Br. 13 n. 9) that Title VI prohibits only purposeful dis-\ncrimination is inconsistent with this federal position and if\naccepted, could impede effective enforcement of \nTitle VI.\nThe United States also has a substantial interest in the\nresolution of the question whether Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1973 prohibits only intentional discrimination against the\nhandicapped. Executive Order 11914, 3 C.F.R. 117 (1976 Comp.),\nreprinted in 29 U.S.C. 794 note (1976 ed.) directed the Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to issue guidelines for\ndetermining what constitutes discrimination within the meaning\nof Section 504. In the exercise of this responsibility, HEW\n1(cid:9) The sole exception is the Small Business Administration,\n13 C.F.R. 112. All the other agency regulations prohibit\ndiscriminatory effects.

See 45 C.F.R. Parts 84 and 85. These\nregulations require federal recipients to operate their programs so\nthat they are accessible to the handicapped. The Court's decision\nin this case could affect the validity of these regulations.\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\nThe United States will address the following two questions:\n1. Whether Title VI authorizes federal agencies to adopt\nregulations that prohibit practices which are discriminatory in\neffect, but not in purpose.\n2. Whether a violation of Section 504 can be established\nwithout proof of intentional discrimination.\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the exception of the discussion in the footnote below,\nthe United States' brief addresses only the questions whether\na violation of Title VI and Section 504 can be established without\n2/\nproof of discriminatory intent.(cid:9) Appellants have argued that a\nviolation of these statutes can be established without such proof,\nwhile Wilmington Medical Center (WMC) has argued that such proof is\nessential. We agree with appellants that discriminatory intent is\nnot a necessary element of a cause of action under either Title VI\nor Section 504.\n2/ In deciding that Congress intended to apply a lesser degree of\nscrutiny to actions resulting in age discrimination than to those\nresulting in racial discrimination, the district court relied upon\nthe reference in the original Age Discrimination Act to \"unreason-\nable\" age discrimination. The 1978 amendments to the Act removed\nthe word unreasonable from the Act's statement of purpose. See\n42 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 6101. Accordingly, there is no longer any basis\nfor drawing a distinction between what the Age Discrimination Act\nprohibits and what Title VI and Section 504 prohibit.\n\n-4-\nThe district court held that appellants had failed to\nestablish any violations under either an intent standard or an\nimpact standard. It therefore saw no need to decide which\nstandard was the appropriate one. While appellants have not\nchallenged the district court's conclusion that they failed to\ndemonstrate discriminatory intent, they have attacked many of\nthe predicates for the district court's conclusion that WMC\nwould also prevail under an impact standard. Should this\nCourt agree with one or more of their contentions, it will\nhave to decide whether intent is a necessary element of a\ncause of action under Title VI or Section 504. The purpose of\nthis brief is to assist the Court in resolving those questions.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES'\nTITLE VI REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN EFFECTS\nSTANDARD TO BE APPLIED IN THIS CASE\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d,\nprovides that:\nNo person in the United States shall,\non the ground of race, color, or national\norigin, be excluded from participation in,\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected\nto discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Act also requires federal agencies to issue regulations to\nenforce these prohibitions. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. The Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), the predecessor to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), adopted several such\nregulations. One regulation prohibits recipients from using\n\"criteria or methods of administration which have the effect\nof subjecting individuals to discrimination\" or have \"the\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment\nof the objectives of the program.\" 45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(2). Another\nproscribes site selections that have \"the effect of excluding\nindividuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting\nthem to discrimination under any [federally assisted] programs.\"\n45 C.F.R. 80.3(b)(3).\nUnder both of these regulations, the recipient's intent is\nirrelevant. A practice with a disparate effect on a group protected\nby Title VI violates the regulations, unless the recipient can\ndemonstrate that the challenged practice is a \"program necessity.\"\nThis requirement is similar to that imposed by provisions of other\n3/\nCivil Rights statutes and involves a showing that (1) the practice\nsubstantially serves one or more of the purposes of the program\nreceiving federal assistance and that (2) there are no less\n3/ Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) (under Title VII,\nemployment practices with a disproportionate impact must be justified\nby business necessity); Board of Education v. Harris 444 U.S. 130, 151\n(1979) (under the Emergency School Aid Act, faculty assignment practices\nwith a disproportionate impact must be justified by educational neces-\nsity). Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 149 (3d Cir.\n1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978) (under Title VIII, a housing\npractice with a disparate effect must be justified by a showing that it\nsubstantially serves a legitimate interest and that no alternative with\nless discriminatory impact would serve that interest equally well.\n\n-6-\ndiscriminatory alternatives that would serve these purposes\n4/\nequally well.\nBecause HHS's regulations incorporate an \"effects standard\"\nrather than an \"intent standard,\" they may prohibit some practices\nthat would not violate the Constitution. See Washington v. Davis,\n426 U.S. 229 (1976). The question we address is whether Title\nVI authorizes such regulations.\nA. Lau v. Nichols establishes the validity of the Department\nof Health and Human Services' regulations\nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568 (1974), the Supreme\nCourt expressly approved the very regulations at issue in this\ncase as a proper interpretation of Title VI and held that under\nTitle VI \"discrimination is barred which has that effect even\n4/ The district court held that WMC had the burden of producing\nevidence but not the burden of persuasion on the issue of program\nnecessity. This holding is incorrect. While the district court\nproperly turned to Title VII for guidance in resolving the issue,\nit failed to recognize that there are two kinds of Title VII\ncases, disparate treatment cases and disproportionate impact\ncases. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15\n(1977). Disparate treatment cases involve claims that an\nemployer treats some people less favorably than others because\nof a personal characteristic such as race. In such cases,\nproof of discriminatory intent is critical. Disproportionate\nimpact cases involve claims that an employment practice, though\nfacially neutral, has a disproportionate impact on a group\nprotected by Title VII and is not justified by business necessity.\nIn these cases, proof of discriminatory intent is not required.\nIn a disparate treatment case, once a prima facie case is shown,\nthe employer need only produce evidence of a non-discriminatory\nreason for its decision. In a disproportionate impact case,\nhowever, the employer has the burden of persuasion on the\nissue of business necessity. Vulcan v. Civil Service Commission,\n490 F.2d 387, 393 (2d Cir. 1973). Because program necessity\nis a justification for a practice that would otherwise violate\nTitle VI and not evidence designed to rebut an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent, the appropriate Title VII analogy is to\nthe disproportionate impact cases, rather than the disparate\ntreatment cases relied upon by the district court. Thus, under\nTitle VI, the recipient has the burden of persuasion and not merely\nthe burden of producing evidence on the issue of program necessity.\n\n- 7 -\n5 /\nthough no purposeful design is present.\" The Court stated that\nTitle VI was an exercise of Congress' power \"to fix the terms\nupon which its money allotments to the State shall be disbursed\"\nand concluded that \"[w]hatever may be the limits of that power,\n* * * they have not been reached here.\" Id. at 569. Lau's\ninterpretation of Title VI is binding on this Court and should\nbe followed in this case.\nWithout any discussion of Lau, Wilmington Medical Center\nasserts that a violation of Title VI cannot be established\nwithout proof of discriminatory purpose. It relies almost exclu-\nsively on the Supreme Court's decisions in Regents of the University\nof California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) and Board of Education\n6/\nv. Harris, 444 U.S. 130 (1979) to support this assertion (cid:9) WMC's\nreliance on Bakke and Harris is misplaced.\nBakke did not purport to overrule Lau; indeed, all nine\njustices cited Lau with approval. 438 U.S. at 303-304 (Powell, J.);\nid. at 342, 350-353 (Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun, JJ.);\nid. at 416-417 and n. 20 (Stevens, J.) Nor is the holding in Bakke\ninconsistent with the holding in Lau.\nBakke involved a medical school admission program that\ncreated an explicit preference for members of certain racial\ngroups.(cid:9) The defendant university did not deny that it intended\n5/ The Court specifically held that a school district's failure\nto attempt to rectify the language deficiency of Chinese speaking\nchildren violated Title VI, even though the school board's failure\nto offer remedial instruction was not motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\n6 /The only other decision relied upon by WMC is Guardians v. Civil\nService Commission, 23 Empl. Prac. Dec. 11 31,153 (D.C. N.Y. 1980)\n(petition for rehearing pending). In that case two district court\njudges sitting by designation concluded that Bakke had overruled Lau.\nFor the reasons discussed above, that conclusion is incorrect and\nshould not be followed.\n\nto treat minority applicants more favorably than white applicants.\nInstead, it sought to justity this preference as a remedy for\npast discrimination.\nAccordingly, the only Title VI issue in Bakke was whether\nTitle VI prohibits all explicit racial preferences, including those\nintended to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Four\njustices interpreted Title VI as a per se ban on all racial\npreferences, regardless of what the Constitution would permit.\nIt was in response to this contention that a majority of the Court\nheld that Title VI permits an explicit use of race so long as\nit is consistent with the Constitution. Mr. Justice Powell stated\nthat \"Title VI must be held to proscribe only those racial class-\nifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the\nFifth Amendment.\" Id. at 287 (emphasis added). And the four\njustices in the Brennan group agreed that \"Title VI goes no further\nin prohibiting the use of race than the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment itself.\" Id. at 325 (emphasis added).\nThus, Bakke involved only the question whether a purposeful\nacknowledged use of race could be justified under Title VI.\nBecause the university conceded that its resort to race was\ndeliberate, the question whether a violation could be established\nwithout proof of such intentional discrimination was not at\nissue. In this situation, Lau continues to state the governing\nprinciple -- practices with a discriminatory effect are pro-\nhibited \"even though no purposeful design is present.\" 414 U.S.\nat 568.\n\n-9-\nWe recognize that the Brennan group appears to have con-\ncluded that Title VI is absolutely coextensive with the Constitution\nand that Lau therefore may have been incorrectly decided. 438 U.S.\nat 352. But the Brennan group also sought to reconcile their\ndecision with Lau. Independent of their conclusion that Title VI\nshould always be interpreted like the Constitution, the Brennan\ngroup rejected a color blind interpretation of Title VI because\nit would be inconsistent with Congress' expressed purpose of\nending the legacy of discrimination against blacks and other\nhistorically disadvantaged groups. Id. at 340, 353, 355.\nAs they put it, a statute \"designed to eliminate discrimination\nagainst racial minorities\" should not be interpreted \"in a\nmanner which would impede efforts to obtain this objective.\"\n7/\nId. at 355.\nMoreover, the fact that some justices have expressed\ndoubts about a decision \"does not make it any less binding upon\n[this Court].\" United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 450\nF.2d 232, 239 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1063 (1972).\nThis Court is simply \"not free to disregard an existing fiat and\nstill live holding of the Supreme Court.\" Ashe v. Swenson, 399 F.2d\n40, 45 (8th Cir. 1968), reversed on other grounds, 397 U.S. 436.\n7 / The Supreme Court applied precisely this principle in holding\nthat Title VII does not prohibit all race conscious affirmative\naction plans. United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 201-202\n(1979).\n\n- 10 -\nHarris did not involve a question under Title VI at all.\nThat case concerned the proper construction of the Emergency\nSchool Aid Act (ESAA), a statute that makes federal aid available\nto local school districts that undertake efforts to reduce\nminority group isolation. The particular provision under\nreview prohibited \"discrimination\" in the assignment of faculty.\nThe Court held that this provision prohibits school districts\nfrom maintaining racially segregated faculties, even if the\nsegregation is not intentional.\nTitle VI was introduced into the case by the school\ndistrict, which argued that Title VI has an intent standard and\nthat ESAA should be interpreted like Title VI. The Court\nspecifically declined to resolve the question of the standard\nof liability under Title VI, however, because it found no\nevidence \"that the two Acts were intended to be coextensive.\"\n444 U.S. at 149.\nThe Court in Harris did not even mention Lau, much less\noverrule it. And the Court's careful reservation of the question\nof the appropriate standard of liability under Title VI makes clear\nthat Bakke did not overrule Lau either.\nWMC's view that Harris supports an intent standard under Title\nVI apparently comes from the Court's observation that (id. at\n150):\n\n- 11 -\nIt does make sense * * * that Congress\nmight impose a stricter standard under\nESAA than under Title VI * * *. A\nviolation of Title VI may result in a\ncut off of all federal funds and it is\nlikely that Congress would wish this\ndrastic result only when the discrimination\nis intentional.\nThis Court should not be guided by this statement for several\nreasons.\nFirst, it is apparent from the Court's brief discussion\nthat it merely presumed that the availability of the fund\ntermination remedy might have prompted Congress to adopt an\nintent standard; the Court did not actually investigate the\n8/\nquestion.\nA careful review of the legislative history leads to\na different conclusion. Thus, opponents of the bill repeatedly\nargued that the fund termination remedy was too drastic and\nthat Title VI showed be defeated for this reason alone. The\n8/(cid:9) Indeed, the only basis for the Court's presumption was\nthat a violation of Title VI would result in a cut off of all\nfederal funds. However, fund termination must \"be limited in\nits effect to a particular program, or part thereof * * *\n[where] noncompliance has been so found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\nSince fund termination under Title VI must be program specific,\nit is arguably no more drastic than a refusal to fund a project\nunder ESAA.\n\n- 12 -\nproponents of the bill did not respond to these attacks with\nassurances that Title VI would only be applied in cases of\nracial animus, however. Instead, they emphasized that the\nstrict procedural safeguards built into Title VI would provide\nadequate protection against the possibility that funds would be\n9/\nterminated without \nsufficient justification.—(cid:9)The logical inference\nis that Congress sought to ameliorate the harshness of the fund\ntermination remedy by guaranteeing procedural fairness and not by\nlimiting Title VI to instances of intentional discrimination.\n9(cid:9) 110 Cong. Rec. 6749 (Sen. Moss); id. at 6544 (Sen. Humphrey);\nI. at 1519 (Rep. Celler); id. at 7066-7067 (Sen. Ribicoff);\nid. at 8345 (Sen. Proxmire); id. at 6562 (Sen.

Rec. 6749):\n[R]egulations giving notice of what conduct\nis required must be drawn up by the agency\nadministering the program. * * * Before such\nregulations become effective, they must\nbe submitted to and approved by the President.\nOnce having become effective, there\nis still a long road to travel before any\nsanction whatsoever is imposed. Formal\naction to compel compliance can only take\nplace after the following has occurred:\nfirst, there must be an unsuccessful attempt\nto obtain voluntary compliance; second, there\nmust be an administrative hearing; third,\na written report of the circumstances and\nthe grounds for such action must be filed\nwith the appropriate committees of the\nHouse and Senate; and fourth, 30 days\nmust have elapsed between such filing and\nthe action denying benefits under a\nFederal program. Finally, even that\n(continued)\n\n- 13 -\nSecond, the dictum in Harris addresses the issue of the\nTitle VI standard only as it applies to fund terminations, while\nthis suit is one for injunctive relief. While we believe that\nproof of intentional discrimination is not required to make out a\nviolation of Title VI in any type of enforcement action, \none\ncourt of appeals has suggested that the dicta in Harris may be\ncompletely inapplicable in suits for injunctive relief. Bryan v.\nKoch, Nos. 80-6085, 80-7401 (2d Cir., July 10, 1980).\nFinally, this Court's obligation is to follow the law as\nit currently stands, regardless of how the Supreme Court may\nultimately decide the issue. Because neither Bakke nor Harris\noverruled Lau, it remains good law and this Court has no authority\n10/\nto disregard it\n / (continued)\naction is by no means final because\nit is subject to judicial review and can\nbe further postponed by judicial action\ngranting temporary relief pending review\nin order to avoid irreparable injury. It\nwould be difficult indeed to concoct any\nadditional safeguards.\nThese procedures are found in 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.\n10/ The Supreme Court's recent decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4979 (U.S. July 2, 1980), confirms the propriety of\nfollowing Supreme Court precedent rather than attempting to\npredict how various justices will decide an issue when it\nfinally comes before them. There, the plurality opinion cited\nLau with approval, although two of the justices joining the\nopinion had previously questioned it. Id. at 4987-4988.\n\n- 14 -\nB. The regulations at issue in this case are authorized\nby Title VI\n1. The administrative interpretation of Title VI\nis reasonable\nWe believe that this Court is not free to reexamine Lau.\nHowever, because this Court may disagree, we now address the\nvalidity of the Title VI regulations at issue. In arguing\nthat the regulations are invalid, WMC ignores the critical\npoint that the interpretation of a statute by those charged\nwith its enforcement \"is entitled to great deference,\" and\nshould be followed \"unless these are compelling indications it\nis wrong.\" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434\n(1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965); Red Lion Broad-\ncasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969). This principle\napplies with even greater force here because Congress has\ndelegated HHS and other federal agencies the task of formulating\nlegislative regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.\n11/\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141 (1976). In\nthis situation, the agency's interpretation of the statute\nmust be followed unless it is \"demonstrably irrational.\"\nFord Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 48 U.S.L.W. 4145, 4148\n(U.S. Feb. 20, 1980).\nUnder Title VI, agencies are \"directed to effectuate the\nprovisions of section 2000d * * * by issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. Because\nthe statute expressly provides that non-compliance with the reg-\nulations may lead directly to sanctions (ibid.), the regulations\nare properly classified as legislative rather than merely\ninterpretive. Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S. at 141-142; Chrysler\nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301-302 (1979); see generally,\nK.C. Davis, Administrative Law § 5.03 (3d ed. 1972).\n\n- 15 -\nTo be sure, in some circumstances it is appropriate to\nattach less weight than usual to an agency's interpretation of\na statute. But there is no basis for departing from the usual\nrule here.\nThus, this is not a case where the agency's interpretation\nwas formulated long after passage of the Act. Gilbert, supra, 429\nU.S. at *142. The regulations at issue in this case were first\nadopted in 1964, only several months after Title VI became\neffective. Such contemporaneous regulations are a particularly\nreliable indication of the meaning of the Act. Udall v. Tallman,\nsupra, 380 U.S. at 16; Power Reactor Co. v. Electricians, 367\nU.S. 396, 408 (1961).\nNor is this a case where the administrative interpretation\nis entitled to less weight than usual because it \"conflict[s]\nwith earlier pronouncements of the agency.\" Gilbert, supra,\n429 U.S. at 143; Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 93-\n94 (1973). HHS and its predecessor, HEW, have consistently\ninterpreted the Act as prohibiting acts with a discriminatory\neffect.\nFinally, this is not a case where the agencies enforcing\nthe statute are divided on the proper interpretation of the\nstatute and the principle of agency deference therefore points\n\"in diametrically opposite directions.\" Gilbert, supra, 429 U.S.\nat 145. To the contrary, at least twenty-five federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI have adopted regulations that prohibit\npractices with a discriminatory effect. See note 1, supra.\n\n- 16 -\nAccordingly, the issue is whether this federal position\nis \"demonstrably irrational.\" Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin,\nsupra, 48 U.S.L.W. at 4148. is we demonstrate below, the inter-\npretation of Title VI adopted by the federal agencies is not only\na rational one, but it is the one that is most consistent with\nthe language of the statute and its legislative history.\na. The language of the statute\nThe argument that Title VI was intended to be absolutely\ncoextensive with the Equal Protection Clause and that it\ntherefore prohibits only intentional discrimination is not\nsupported by the language of the statute. The statute\ndoes not protect beneficiaries of federally assisted programs\nagainst \"denials of equal protection.\" Instead, the statutory\nterms provide that no person is to be \"excluded from,\" \"denied\nthe benefits of\" or \"subjected to discrimination under\" any\nfederal program. If Congress had the limited objective of\nprohibiting denials of equal protection and nothing more, it\npresumably would have used equal protection language.\nA comparison between the language of Title VI and other\ntitles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 strongly supports this\nconclusion. Title III of the Act protects an individual from\nbeing \"deprived of * * * his right to the equal protection of the\nlaws * * * by being denied equal utilization of any public\nfacility.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000b. And Title IV of the same Act\nprotects a minor child from \"being deprived by a school board\nof the equal protection of the laws.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6.\n\n- 17 -\nThus, when Congress wanted to incorporate equal protection\nstandards, it used equal protection language. The far more\nexpansive language in Title VI is strong evidence that Congress\ndid not intend to link Title VI to the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\nh. Legislative history\nThe legislative history of Title VI supports the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. Thus, President Kennedy, in his\nmessage to Congress proposing the legislation that ultimately\nbecame Title VI, outlined the broad objectives of the proposal\n(109 Cong. Rec. 1161 (1964))(emphasis added):\nSimple justice requires that public funds,\nto which all taxpayers contribute, not be\nspent in any fashion which encourages,\nentrenches, subsidizes or results in racial\ndiscrimination.\nSenator Humphrey repeated President Kennedy's message in his\nspeech opening the debate on Title VI. 110 Cong. Rec. 6543.\nAnd the statements of other proponents also reflect that Congress\nwas concerned with results of recipients' practices and not simply the\n12/\nmotivation.\n12/ 110 Cong. Rec. 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id. at 2484 (Rep. O'Hara);\nid. at 1519 (Rep. Celler).\n\n- 18 -\nThis emphasis on eliminating discriminatory results\nregardless of motivation was not lost on opponents of the bill.\nFor example, Congressman Robertson complained that under Title VI,\nas under Title VII, \"it would not be necessary to show any willful\npurpose or intentional volition * * *. It would appear to be\nsufficient to show that discrimination does in fact exist.\"\nId. at 8428 (quoting legal memorandum of the National Association\nof Manufacturers). Congressman Willis also complained that the\nbill went beyond constitutional prohibitions (id. at 1623):\nIf people are being denied equal protection\nof the laws under the 14th amendment or if their\nright to vote is being abridged or denied under\nthe 15th amendment * * * and if that is all you\nwant * * * I would support it. But that is\na far cry from the unlimited provisions of this\nbill.\nSupporters of the bill did not dispute these charges.\nThe debate over the failure of Title VI to include a\ndefinition of discrimination furnishes particularly strong\nevidence that Congress did not want to link Title VI to the\nEqual Protection Clause. Much of the opposition to Title VI\ncentered on its failure to define discrimination. Opponents\nrepeatedly argued that the absence of a definition meant that\neach federal agency would have discretion to determine for\n13/\nitself what constituted discrimination.\nIf Congress had intended to incorporate the equal protec-\ntion standard, the sponsors of the bill would very likely have\n13/ 110 Cong. Rec. 1619 (Rep. Abernathy); id. at 1630 (Rep. Dowdy);\nid. at 9083-9084 (Sen. Gore); id. at 10690 (Sen. Thurmond).\n\n- 19 -\nresponded to these charges with assurances that the agencies would be\nlimited to enforcing the equal protection standard of discrimination.\nBut the supporters of the bill did not want to confine the agencies'\ndiscretion in this way. Instead, they thought it \"wise to leave the\nagencies a good deal of discretion as to how they [would] act.\" 110\n14/\nCong. Rec. 6546 (Sen. Humphrey). (cid:9) Accordingly, they refused to equate\ndiscrimination under Title VI with the standard of equal treatment\nincorporated in the Equal Protection Clause.\nThe legislative history also reflects that in enacting Title VI,\nCongress relied primarily on its spending power and not its power to\nenforce equal protection guarantees. 110 Cong. Rec. 1527, 2467 (Rep.\nCeller); id. at 6546 (Sen. Humphrey); id. at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id.\nat 12675-12677 (Sen. Allott). This reliance on the spending power\nstrongly indicates that Congress intended to do more than simply pro-\nhibit violations of the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, one the goals of Title VI was to eliminate federal\ninvolvement in violations of equal protection guarantees. But there\nis no evidence in the legislative history that this was all Congress\n15/\nintended to accomplish.\n14/ Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy made a similar point in his\nUestimony on the bill. Responding to criticism of the bill's failure\nto define discrimination, he stated (ibid.):\nWe are dealing with a large number of programs,\neach with its own special problems * * *(cid:9) What\nis appropriate for one program may not fit another.\n15/ The statements cited in the Brennan group opinion in Bakke (438\nU.S. at 330-333) all show that eliminating federal involvement in con-\nstitutional violations was one objective of Title VI, not that it was\nthe only objective. Moreover, the cited passages all come from general\nremarks that did not focus on the meaning of discrimination under\nTitle VI. As discussed above, when pressed for a definition of dis-\ncrimination, the sponsors refused to provide one.\n\n- 20 -\nc. De facto segregation\nCongress' treatment of de facto segregation under Title VI\nalso supports the federal agencies' construction of Title VI.\nFrom the beginning, Congress has taken specific steps to insure\nthat in the single area of school segregation, federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI would have no authority to go beyond constitu-\ntional requirements. These measures reflect Congress' awareness\nthat Title VI does not by its own terms express a constitutional\nstandard and that any such limitation would require additional\nlanguage.\nFirst, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6, which provides\nthat \"nothing herein shall enpower any official or court of the\nUnited States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial\nbalance in .any school by requiring the transportation of pupils\nor students from one school to another.\" Although that provision\nwas passed as part of Title IV, the legislative history of\nTitle VI reveals that the word \"herein\" refers to the entire\n16/\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, including Title VI.(cid:9) In 1966, Congress\nadded 42 U.S.C. 2000d-5 which provides that \"compliance * * *\nwith a final [desegregation] order * * * of a Federal court * * *\nshall be deemed to be compliance with [Title VI].\" Finally, in\n1970, Congress amended Title VI to include a provision requiring\nuniformity in the treatment \"of segregation by race, whether de\njure or de facto * * * in all regions of the United States\" and\n16/ 110 Cong. Rec. 12715 (Sen. Humphrey).\n\n- 21 -\nexplained that \"[s]uch uniformity refers to one policy applied\nuniformly to de jure segregation wherever found and such other\npolicy as may be provided pursuant to law applied uniformly to\nde facto segregation wherever found.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-6(a),(b).\nThus, Congress was plainly aware that the language of\nTitle VI was broader than the constitutional prohibition against\ndenials of equal protection. When it wanted to confine Title\nVI to constitutional standards, as in the area of school segregation,\nit did so explicitly.\nd. Subsequent legislation\nSince the passage of Title VI, Congress has enacted several\nstatutes modeled on Title VI, including Section 504 of the Rehabili-\ntation Act (29 U.S.C. 794), Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681), the Revenue Sharing Act (31 U.S.C. 1242),\nthe Age Discrimination Act (42 U.S.C. 6106) and the Local Public\nWorks Capital Development and Investment Act (42 U.S.C. 6709).\nEach of these statutes was passed after the federal agencies\nenforcing Title VI had adopted regulations with an effects standard\nand the latter two provisions were passed after the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Lau. If Congress thought that either the agencies\nor the Supreme Court had misconstrued Title VI, it presumably\nwould have taken steps to make sure that such \"mistakes\" would\nnot be repeated in the future. Not only did Congress fail to take\nsuch action, but in some cases it affirmatively indicated that\nthese statutes should be construed in accordance with existing\n\n- 22 -\n17/\ninterpretations of Title VI.(cid:9) This implicit approval of the\nagencies' Title VI regulations significantly undermines WMC's\nclaim that the agencies have misinterpreted Title VI. See\nRed Lion Broadcasting, supra, 395 U.S. at 380-381.\nIn sum, the language of the statute, its history,\namendments to the Act, and subsequent legislation patterned on\nTitle VI all fully support the reasonableness of the agency\nconstruction of Title VI. WMC's invitation to invalidate the\nregulations should be rejected.\n2. The agency regulations are also valid because they are\nreasonably related to the goal of preventing intentional\ndiscrimination\nEven if this Court concludes that the only reasonable\ninterpretation of Title VI is that it incorporates the constitutional\nstandard, that would not end the matter. An agency that has\nbeen delegated rule making power has broad discretion to create\nnew obligations that are not created by the statute itself. The\nonly limitation on this power is that the new obligations must\nbe \"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\"\nMourning v. Family Publications Service, 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973).\nBecause HHS and the other federal agencies enforcing Title VI have\nbeen delegated law making power (see page 14, supra), their regulations\nmust be judged by these standards.\n17/ For example, \"the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed\nthat it would be interpreted and enforced in the same manner as\nTitle VI.\" Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 678\n(1979). And the Public Works Act expressly provides that it\nshould \"be enforced through agency provisions and rules similar\nto those already established, with respect to racial and other\ndiscrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of\n1964.\"(cid:9) 42 U.S.C. 6709.\n\n- 23 -\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Mourning illustrates the\nbreadth of this power. Mourning involved the question whether\na Federal Reserve Board regulation was consistent with the Truth\nin Lending Act. The Act requires the disclosure of certain\ncontract information whenever a finance charge is imposed.\n15 U.S.C. 1631. The regulation goes beyond the Act and requires\ndisclosure whenever a finance charge is imposed or whenever\npayment is to be made in more than four installments. 12 C.F.R.\n226.2(k). The regulation was designed to discourage creditors\nfrom attempting to hide the finance charge in the cash price,\na problem that was felt to be particularly acute in transactions\ninvolving more than four payments.\nAlthough the lower court thought that the regulation was\ninvalid because it included transactions not covered by the Act,\nthe Supreme Court disagreed. The Court specifically explained\nthat (411 U.S. at 374):\nWhere, as here, the transactions or conduct\nwhich Congress seeks to administer occur\nin myriad and changing forms, a require-\nment that a line be drawn which insures\nthat not one blameless individual will\nbe subject to the provisions of an act\nwould unreasonably encumber effective\nadministration and permit many clear\nviolators to escape regulation entirely.\nThe same principle applies here. Even assuming Title VI\nprohibits only acts of intentional discrimination, an agency\nenforcing Title VI is not limited to conducting a case by case\ninquiry into the intent of the recipient. Such an approach\nwould allow many violations to escape detection since even\n\n- 24 -\nunder the best of circumstances, evidence of discriminatory\nintent may be extremely difficult to uncover. An agency may\ntherefore forego a direct inquiry into intent and establish a\nrule that is easier to administer and that reduces the danger\nthat violations will escape detection.\nHHS's regulations serve this function. Under the agency's\nregulations the demand for a proper justification is activated\nby evidence that a practice has a substantially disproportionate\nimpact on a group that has historically been subjected to discrimi-\nnation. Such evidence is often indicative of discriminatory\nintent. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252 (1977). When a recipient is unable to show that\nthe practice is manifestly related to the purposes of the\nprogram receiving assistance, the danger that discrimination is\nbeing practiced increases since normally a recipient will want\nto choose procedures that effectively carry out the purposes\nof its program. Finally, the presence of alternatives that\nwould serve these purposes equally well indicates that the\npurported reason for the practice may be a mask for intentional\ndiscrimination. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405,\n425 (1975). Thus, although the agency regulations do not\nrequire a finding of intentional discrimination, they are well\nadapted to rooting out violations of the Constitution.\n\n- 25 -\nAs in Mourning, it is no objection that the regulations\nwill apply in some situations in which intentional discrimination\nis not being practiced. An agency should be free to adopt\n\"prophylactic measure[s] * * * in order to discourage evasion\"\nof the Act's requirements. Mourning, supra, 411 U.S. at 377.\nCongressional legislation enforcing the Civil Rights\nAmendments strongly supports the reasonableness of the agency's\napproach here. For example, the Voting Rights Act of 1965\nprohibits covered jurisdictions from making any change that\nwill have a disparate effect on minority voters, although the\nFifteenth Amendment may prohibit only intentional discrimination.\nSimilarly, Title VII prohibits public employers from using\nemployment practices with a discriminatory effect, unless\njustified by business necessity, while the Fourteenth Amendment\nprohibits only intentional discrimination. The Supreme Court\nexpressly upheld the Voting Rights Act on the ground that\nCongress could reasonably conclude that changes with a disparate\neffect created a sufficient risk of purposeful discrimination\nto warrant prophylactic relief. City of Rome v. United States,\n48 U.S.L.W. 4463,.4469 (U.S. April 22, 1980). The lower courts\nhave sustained Title VII on similar'grounds. E.g., United States\nv. City of Chicago, 573 F.2d 416, 420-424 (7th Cir. 1978). As\nthe Court's decision in Mourning makes clear, the principle\ninvolved in these cases \"applies to administrative agencies as\nwell as to legislatures.\" 411 U.S. at 374.\n\n- 26 -\nII\nA VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 CAN BE ESTABLISHED\nWITHOUT PROOF OF DISCRIMINATORY INTENT\nWMC also argues that a violation of Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 cannot be established without proof\nof intentional discrimination against handicapped individuals.\nThis argument is incorrect.\nSection 504 provides that\n[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped indivi-\ndual * * * shall, solely by reason of his\nhandicap, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.\nThe language of the statute thus prohibits all discrimination against\nqualified handicapped individuals, without limitation. Nothing\nin the language of Section 504 suggests that it reaches only inten-\ntional discrimination.\nMoreover, there is no evidence in the legislative history\nthat Congress was concerned only with intentional discrimination\nagainst the handicapped. To the contrary, the legislative history\nreflects that Congress was aware that intentional discrimination\nwas only a small part of the problem that the handicapped encounter.\nCongress knew that the more widespread and intransigent problem\nwas that decisions had been made, facilities had been constructed\nand programs had been designed without any consideration of the\nhandicapped.\n\n- 27 -\nThus, in a report calling for a White House Conference on\nthe Handicapped, issued the same day as the Senate Report accompany-\ning the 1973 Act, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare\nemphasized that the handicapped suffer not only from intentional\ndiscrimination but also from indifference to their needs. S. Rep.\nNo. 93-319, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973). The report specifically\nexplained that handicapped persons are (id. at 2-3)\nall too often excluded from schools and\neducational programs, barred from employment\nor * * * underemployed because of archaic\nattitudes toward the handicapped, denied\naccess to transportation, buildings and\nhousing because of architectural barriers\nand lack of planning, and * * * discriminated\nagainst by our public laws. * * * Too often\nour programing for, and thinking about, the\nhandicapped fails because of lack of know-\nledge. Too often we find that we automatically\nmake the assumption that nothing can be done.\nThe Senate report accompanying the 1973 Act likewise makes\nclear that Congress' primary concern in enacting Section 504 was\nto insure that handicapped persons would have access to federally\nassisted programs. That report specifically \"proclaims a policy\nof non-discrimination against otherwise qualified handicapped\nindividuals with respect to participation in or access to any\nprogram which is in receipt of Federal financial assistance.\"\nS. Rep. No. 93-318, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 50 (1973).\n\n- 28 -\nConsistent with Congress' overriding concern that\nthe handicapped not be denied access to federally assisted programs,\nHEW, the agency charged with responsibility for coordinating federal\nenforcement of Section 504, adopted regulations that describe the\nnature of the recipients' obligations under Section 504. These\nregulations require recipients to \"operate each program or\nactivity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to handicapped persons.\" 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(a). In addition, the regulations provide specific examples\nof the kinds of modifications recipients must undertake in order to\nmake their programs accessible to the handicapped. 45 C.F.R.\n84.22(b). A recipient may not avoid its obligations under these\nsections by showing that it does not intend to discriminate against\nhandicapped persons. The obligation to insure program accessibility\napplies irrespective of the intent of the recipient. Indeed, in\naddition to the specific requirement of program accessibility, the\nregulations contain a general prohibition against any practice that\nhas \"the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to dis-\ncrimination on the basis of handicap\" or that has \"the purpose or\neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of\n\n- 29 -\nthe objectives of the recipient's program.\" 45 C.F.R. 84.4(4).\nThese \nregulations provide an authoritative guide in construing\n18/\nSection 504. See page 14, supra.\nNothing in the Supreme Court's decision in Southeastern\nCommunity College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), undercuts the\nforce of these regulations or indicates that Section 504 reaches\nonly intentional discrimination. To the contrary, the Court\nexpressly relied upon the agency regulations in resolving the\nissue before it and indicated that HEW (now HHS) would have broad\nlatitute to go beyond prohibiting intentional discrimination in\nenforcing Section 504. Id. at 406-407, 412-413.\nIn Davis, a professional nursing school rejected an applicant\nfor its program whose hearing disability prevented her from safely\nparticipating in the clinical part of the program. In holding that\nthe school had not violated Section 504, the Court derived support\nfrom HEW's regulations which provide that an \"otherwise qualified\"\nhandicapped person is one who is able to meet all essential\nqualifications. Id. at 406-407.\n18/ Because the regulations require recipients to make modifica-\ntions that may be costly, HEW submitted them to Congress with an\nexplicit request that Congress evaluate them to make sure that\nintent. \nthey were consistent with congressional  Congress did not\nexpress any disatisfaction with the agency's approach. Instead,\nit sought to assist recipients by assuming some of the costs of\ncompliance. Thus, the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973 include a provision that authorizes grants to state units\nfor the purpose of providing \"such information and technical\nassistance (including support personnel such as interpreters for\nthe deaf) as may be necessary to assist those entities in complying\nwith the Act, particularly the requirements of Section 504.\"\n29 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 775.\n\n- 30 -\nAlthough the applicant argued that HEW's regulations\nrequired the school to modify its program  enable her to \nto  par-\nticipate, the Court concluded that the regulations did not\nmandate the kind of modifications she sought. Thus, the evidence\nin the record indicated that the applicant could safely participate\nin the clinical program only by receiving close individual atten-\ntion from a nursing instructor, yet the regulations exclude such\n\"personalized services\" from the kinds of auxiliary aids a school\nmust provide. Id. at 409.\nThe Court also rejected the suggestion that the college was\nrequired to eliminate clinical training as a prerequisite to\ncompletion of its program. The Court found that a clinical program\nwas an essential part of the curriculum and that without it a\nstudent would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training\na nurse normally receives. Id. at 409-410. The Court held that\nthe agency regulations do not require a recipient to waive such\nessential requirements. Ibid.\nThis does not mean that under Section 504 and the regulations\na recipient may simply adopt a neutral stance and fail to consider\nways to make its program accessible to the handicapped. The Court\nin Davis expressly indicated that recipients must adopt program\nmodifications when that is necessary to prevent discrimination\nagainst the handicapped and that HEW (now HHS) would continue to\nhave a significant role in identifying when \"a refusal to accommodate\n\n- 31 -\nthe needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against\nthe handicapped.\" Id. at 413. Nothing in Davis suggests that\nHHS may require accommodations only in cases of intentional dis-\ncrimination.\nThe Fifth Circuit's recent decision in Camenish v. University\nof \nTexas, 616 F.2d 127 (1980), demonstrates the importance of the\nagency regulations in construing Section 504 and confirms that\nSection 504 does not require proof of discriminatory intent. In\nthat case, the defendant university refused to provide a deaf\ngraduate student with a sign language interpreter. The plaintiff\ndid not claim that the university's refusal to provide an inter-\npreter reflected an intent to exclude handicapped persons from its\nprogram. Indeed, since the university was willing to allow the\nplaintiff to continue in its program if he provided his own inter-\npreter, and would have provided an interpreter itself if plaintiff\nmet the established criteria for financial assistance, any such\nclaim would have been difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, the\ncourt held that the university's failure to provide an interpreter\nviolated Section 504.\nThe University had argued that under Davis, its failure to\nprovide an interpreter could not constitute discrimination under\nSection 504. The Fifth Circuit disagreed. The court pointed out\nthat unlike the situation in Davis, where the applicant was not\n\"otherwise qualified\" because her handicap prevented her from ever\n\n- 32 -\nrealizing the principle benefits of the program, Camenish could\n\"obviously perform well in his profession.\" Id. at 133. More-\nover, the court emphasized that while Davis had sought personalized\nservices not contemplated by the regulations, the interpretive\nservices requested by Camenisch were expressly required by HEW's\nregulation.\nThus, Camenish fully supports the agency's view that a\nrecipient must adopt appropriate modifications to permit participa-\ntion by otherwise qualified handicapped persons and that such\nmodifications must be undertaken, whether or not the recipient's\nfailure to include the handicapped is motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nIn sum, the issue under Section 504 is whether the recipient\nhas taken appropriate steps to make its program accessible to the\nhandicapped. In making this determination, a court should be\nguided by the regulations adopted by HEW. WMC's effort to limit\nthe issue to whether its decisions are infected with an intent to\ndiscriminate against handicapped persons should be rejected.\n\n- 33 -\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court should hold that a violation of Title VI and\nSection 504 can be established without proof of discriminatory\npurpose.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDREW S.

Section 1122. \n \n28  Ad.Rec. Ex. SM-4 at SM-998 to 1001. The HPC had held public hearings during the course of its review on May 3, 4 \n  and 5, 1976. \n \n29  Docket Item 23, Trivits Affidavit; Docket Item 66A, Exs. 3 & 4. \n \n \n30  Section 1122(d). The Secretary’s role at this point is purely ministerial: if he finds that (1) neither the designated \n  planning agency nor the areawide planning group were given notice by the hospital of its proposed capital \nexpenditure “at least 60 days prior to obligation for such expenditure,” section 1122(d)(1)(A), or (2) the designated \nplanning agency had notified the hospital that its capital expenditure proposal was not consistent with the criteria \nand standards developed by the agency or the State, then the Secretary is Required to reduce the hospital’s \nmedicare payments by the “amount which is attributable to depreciation, interest on borrowed funds, . . . or other \nexpenses related to such capital expenditure.” Section 1122(d)(1)(B). \nSection 1122(d)(2), however, authorizes the Secretary to allow full or partial federal reimbursement even though \nthe local agency has rejected the hospital’s application, if, after review by an advisory council, the Secretary finds \n41 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \nthat reducing or withholding reimbursement “would discourage the operation or expansion of (a hospital) which has \ndemonstrated to his satisfaction proof of capability to provide comprehensive health care services . . . efficiently, \neffectively, and economically, . . ..” This source of potential discretionary authority is not implicated here because \nPlan Omega was approved by the local planning agencies. \n \n31  Docket Item 23 (Trivits Affidavit). \n \n \n32  Conversely, section 1122 certification is not a guarantee that a hospital will receive medicare funds. Rather, it \n  “merely eliminates one possible ground for the reduction, but not the elimination, of medicare payments.” NAACP \nv. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., 436 F.Supp. 1194, 1198 n.13 (D.Del.1977). \n \n33  The pendency of this action functions as a de facto injunction, thwarting WMC’s efforts to market its bonds and to \n  commence construction. \n \n34  Docket Item 52, First Amended Complaint par. 22. Plaintiffs also alleged that the residual Delaware Division facility \n  will be staffed primarily by interns and residents, while the proposed Stanton Division will be staffed principally with \nboard certified specialists. Id. par. 23. Thus, plaintiffs basically maintain that those persons who use the residual \nWilmington facility will be provided hospital services qualitatively different from the services provided to others \nusing the Stanton hospital. \n \n35  Id. par. 21. \n \n \n36  Id. par. 29. \n \n \n37  Id. pars. 23-26, 28, 30-31. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Secretary had failed to file a detailed statement on the \n  environmental impact of WMC’s proposed hospital relocation as allegedly required by the National Environmental \nPolicy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. s 4321 Et seq. In an earlier opinion, however, the Court granted summary \njudgment  in  favor  of  the  Secretary  on  the  NEPA  claim,  holding  that  the  Secretary’s  limited  role  in  the \nimplementation of Plan Omega under the provisions of section 1122 does not constitute “major Federal action” \nnecessitating preparation of an environmental impact statement. NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., 436 \nF.Supp. 1194 (D.Del.1977). That ruling is presently on appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \n38  45 C.F.R. s 80.7(b). Regulations for effectuating the rights guaranteed by Section 504 became effective June 3, 1977. \n  42 Fed.Reg. 22675 (May 4, 1977) (45 C.F.R. Part 84). In s 84.61 of those regulations the Secretary adopted the Title \nVI complaint and enforcement procedures for use in implementing Section 504. See 42 Fed.Reg. 22695-702. \n42 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \n \n39  NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., 426 F.Supp. 919, 924 (D.Del.1977). The Court recognized the general rule \n  that “the failure to seek administrative redress of Title VI and (Section) 504 grievances would require dismissal of a \nsuit brought under Title VI and (Section) 504 in a federal court.” Id. (citations omitted). The Secretary’s regulations, \nhowever,  call  for  a  Title  VI  investigation  “whenever  a  compliance  review,  report,  complaint,  or  Any  other \ninformation indicates a possible failure to comply with (the Secretary’s Title VI regulations).” 45 C.F.R. s 80.7(c) \n(emphasis added). Manifestly, when the complaint filed in this case was served upon the Secretary he received \nsufficient “information” to initiate a Title VI investigation. \nThe Court also rejected plaintiffs’ request that the exhaustion requirement be waived in this particular proceeding \nbased on their contention that efforts to seek administrative review of their claim would have been futile because of \nthe paucity of personnel resources available to the Secretary to process Title VI and Section 504 complaints. 426 \nF.Supp. at 924-25. It was clear, however, that if the Secretary later exhibited an inability or unwillingness to conduct \nhis review in a timely fashion the Court would seriously consider granting plaintiffs’ request and proceed to consider \nthe legality of Plan Omega without the benefit of an administrative record. Id. at 925. \n \n40  Id. at 925 (citations omitted). \n \n \n41  “(T)he Court is confronted with two separate, but closely related, questions. The first question involves whether \n  Plan Omega will have a discriminatory impact; the second question requires a detailed consideration of the \nrelationship between (section) 1122 and Title VI and (Section) 504. The need for prompt resolution of the first \nquestion is readily apparent. If the Stanton hospital will eventually be built, minimization of cost is a goal which all \nparties can support. If the Stanton hospital will not be built because of a finding of discriminatory effect, alternate \nsolutions may then be quickly developed because it appears that at least two of WMC’s three hospitals are running \nsome risk of loss of accreditation. The broader, second question, which deserves full consideration and timely \ndisposition, does not warrant an expedited review and deserves mature reflection on the consequences and \nramifications of any decision by the Court. Accordingly, it is the Court’s view that the issues directly related to Plan \nOmega must be resolved separately.” Id. at 924. \n \n42  Docket Item 82 (Report To The Court Concerning Investigation Of Plan Omega With Respect To Alleged Title VI \n  Violations). \n \n43  Id. at 3. \n \n \n44  The Secretary had filed a report on May 4, 1977, indicating that an additional two months would be required to \n  complete the investigative phase of this litigation.

The report stated: \n“The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in \naccordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action ‘committed to agency discretion,’ which \nmight otherwise be carried over into section 603.

Thus,  Federal  agencies  and \ndepartments should cooperate in developing standards and policies so that there is a uniform, consistent Federal \napproach to these sections. The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, because of that \nDepartment’s experience in dealing with handicapped persons and with the elimination of discrimination in other \nareas, should assume responsibility for coordinating the section 504 enforcement effort and for establishing a \ncoordinating mechanism with the Secretary of the Department of Labor to ensure a consistent approach to the \nimplementation of sections 503 and 504. The conferees fully expect that H.E.W.‘s section 504 regulations should be \ncompleted by the close of this year. Delay beyond this point would be most unfortunate since the Act (P.L. 93-112) \nwas enacted over one year ago September 26, 1973. \nThe conferees noted, and the committee reiterates, that Executive Order No. 11758, section 2, delegates to the \nSecretary  of  Labor  the  responsibility  for  carrying  out  the  responsibilities  embodied  in  section  503  of  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, and a similar delegation of responsibility to the Secretary of HEW is urged to carry out on \na Government-wide basis those responsibilities embodied in section 504.“ \n1974 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News p. 6391. \n \n78  42 Fed.Reg. 22676-94 (May 4, 1977).

News pp. 6390-91. \n \n \n83  At one point, the plaintiffs appeared to rely upon Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U.S. 840, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 1956, 48 \n  L.Ed.2d 416 (1976) as establishing their right to a De novo trial. (Docket Item 181 at 12). In Chandler, however, the \nSupreme Court considered the question whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which amended \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to extend its protection to federal employees, accorded the latter the same \nright to a trial De novo of employment discrimination claims as “private sector” employees enjoy under Title VII. The \nCourt answered in the affirmative, noting that the plain language of the 1972 amendment as well as its legislative \nhistory indicated Congress’ intent to extend to federal employees a right to De novo judicial trial of their Title VII \ncomplaints rather than mere judicial review of employing agency determinations. Id. at 852, 862. Obviously, judicial \nconstruction of an amendment to Title VII is not very supportive in the context of Title VI and Section 504. \nFurthermore, the precedential value of Chandler in the instant case is completely undercut by the fact that the \nlanguage of Title VI and Section 504 and their respective legislative histories belie any intent by Congress to \nauthorize, implicitly or explicitly, a judicial trial De novo. \n \n48 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \n84  The jurisdictional statement in the Lau plaintiffs’ complaint read: \n \n“Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C. s 1331 and by 28 U.S.C. s 1343(3)(4), Which provide original \njurisdiction in suits authorized by 42 U.S.C. s 1983.” Plaintiffs’ Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, Lau v. \nNichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (emphasis added), Quoted in Cannon v. University of \nChicago, 559 F.2d 1063, 1083 n.7 (C.A. 7, 1976). \n \n85  The Secretary’s final Section 504 regulations became effective about six months after the Lloyd opinion was handed \n  down. See note 78 Supra. \nThe Third Circuit was recently presented the question whether Section 504 impliedly authorizes a private judicial \nremedy, but declined to answer it. Gurmankin v. Costanzo, 556 F.2d 184 (C.A. 3, 1977). \n \n86  The Secretary contemplates no further administrative proceedings under Title VI or Section 504 concerning Plan \n  Omega and, therefore, the signing of the contract of assurances constitutes final departmental action. See Docket \nItems 170 at 2; 171 at 1; 173 at 2, par. A; 174 at 3. Furthermore, no statute expressly precludes judicial review, and \nthe terms of Title VI and Section 504 are not so broad that there is no law to apply. See 5 U.S.C. s 701(a)(1), (2); \nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct 814 (1971). \n \n87  In addition, Overton Park instructs reviewing courts to consider whether the agency acted within the scope of its \n  authority and discretion and whether the agency followed its own procedural regulations. 401 U.S. at 415-16, 91 \nS.Ct. 814. It is clear in this case, and no party disputes, that the Secretary acted within his authority in seeking to \nbring Plan Omega into compliance with the statutes and that he followed the procedures prescribed in his \nregulations. \n \n88  Docket Item 218A (Wolfe Report), B (Manheim Report), C (Pollack Affidavit), D (Bayard Affidavit), E (Rose Affidavit); \n  Docket Items 207 (Chachkin Deposition), 221A-C (Redman Deposition), 222 (Middleton Deposition). The Court notes \nthat Docket Items 218G (Wood & Tower Report) and F (Margulies Letter to Rose) are included in the certified \nadministrative record and, therefore, properly may be considered on review. \n \n89  Docket Item 217, Memorandum of Points and Authorities, at 23. \n \n \n90  Similarly, the Court will not consider the affidavit of James P. Tyler, Director of Finance for the WMC, submitted by \n  WMC in support of its cross-motion for summary judgment. (Docket Item 232). \n \n91  Actually, the record indicates that HEW did consult with Dr. Montague Brown, a health expert, and a number of his \n  associates in the Health Administration Graduate Program at Duke University and with Dr. Steven Lipson of the \nDepartment of Community Medicine at Georgetown University.

No. 40 at 29. \n \n92  Investigative Report at 198-202. \n \n \n93  It is noteworthy that already by 1968 WMC had focused on three kinds of options: (1) it could seek to develop a \n  large hospital facility in the city and establish a smaller one in the county, (2) it could build or establish two hospitals \nof equal size in both the city and the county, or (3) it could build a large hospital in the county while retaining a \nsmaller one in the city. All three plans thus included the building of a suburban hospital of some magnitude, ranging \nfrom a 200 bed community hospital to Plan Omega’s 800 bed concept. In the course of his investigation into Plan \nOmega, the Secretary considered WMC’s claims regarding the availability of alternative plans and sites as well as the \nnature of WMC’s reasons for rejecting them. Furthermore, the record indicates that, based on his review, the \nSecretary believed Plan Omega offered “considerably less risk” of a discriminatory impact than the discarded \nprograms, Provided certain conditions were accepted and met by WMC. Investigative Report at 198-202, 206. \n \n94  Contrary to the plaintiffs, the Court reads Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, supra, As supporting the Secretary’s \n  decision Not to investigate other proposals. In that case, Judge Garth outlined the parameters of a district court’s \ndiscretion in determining whether a defendant has carried its burden of rebutting a Prima facie Title VIII case. \nAlthough the defendant there had offered no justification for its discriminatory actions, the Court recognized that if \na defendant (in this instance WMC) comes forward with evidence showing that no other alternative course of action \ncan be adopted, the burden shifts to the plaintiff (in this case the Secretary) to demonstrate that other practices are \navailable. 564 F.2d at 149 n. 37. On the other hand, paraphrasing Judge Garth, “(WMC’s) failure to offer proof of \njustification renders fruitless consideration of any other factors . . . in determining whether (the Secretary’s Prima \nfacie Case (has) been overcome. . . . If the (Title VI) Prima facie case is not rebutted, a violation is proved. The \nquestion of remedy then remains.” Id. at 149-50. \n \n95  Present admission data supplied by WMC in the following medical services show a disproportionately low incidence \n  of minority patients and minority patient days spent in private versus clinical categories: \n  Number of Patients  Number of Days \n   \n  ------------------  -------------- \n   \n  Private  Service  Private  Service \n50 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \n       \n  -------  -------  -------  ------- \n       \nMedical Service  (White)  (Nonwhite)  (White)  (Nonwhite)  (White)  (Nonwhite)  (White)  (Nonwhite) \n                 \n---------------                 \n \n                 \nNeurology  130  5  0  0  1291  51  0  0 \n                 \n                 \nCardiovascular  716  84  37  24    Not Available   \n           \n(represents                 \n \ndischarge data)                 \n \n                 \nNephrology  62  10  0  0  772  146  0  0 \n                 \n                 \nNeurosurgery  268  29  21  11  3894  185  418  185 \n                 \n96   It is clear, however, that the Secretary’s regulations require an investigation whenever there is reason to suspect a \n  possible failure to comply with the civil rights laws in question. 45 C.F.R. s 80.7(c).

The Wood & Tower report, which includes a cost analysis of Plan \n  Omega and alternative proposals, contains the following observation: \nIf the maximum project cost (for Plan Omega) is $75,000,000 and if the number of beds at completion must be in \nthe vicinity of 1,000, the Medical Center’s construction program must be modified to incorporate more renovation \nof existing facilities and much less new construction. Even if only 540 new beds were built, the total project cost \nwould be $70,000,000. This would leave only $5,000,000. for all other necessary renovation to 460 beds (at the \nDelaware Division). Although renovation costs are much less per bed, $5,000,000. would not be sufficient for the \n51 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \nrequired renovation.

No. 2 at 2-3. \n \n \n101  About 30% Of all persons in New Castle County live within two and one-half miles of WMC’s present location, while \n  6% Live within a comparable distance of the proposed Stanton location. Investigative Report at 19, 20. Of course, as \nthe  distance  from  the  two  locations  increases,  the  disparity  diminishes.  For  example,  95%  Of  the  county’s \npopulation resides within ten miles of the Delaware Division as compared to 88% Residing within the same distance \nfrom the proposed Southwest Division. Id. at 70. \n \n102  Id. \n \n \n103  Because of the recognized relationship between the aging process and physical disabilities leading to increased \n  hospitalization,  the  areas  of  population  concentrated  by  age  were  calculated  to  ascertain  the  potential \ndisadvantages to the elderly posed by the relocation. The elderly were defined as including persons aged 60 and \nolder. Investigative Report at 25-26. \n \n104  HEW was unable to obtain data showing the incidence of handicapped persons by zip code; instead, it relied on data \n  which indicate the number of disabled workers receiving social security disability payments for purposes of \ncalculating population concentration by handicap. Id. at 31. \n \n105  Using either the “concentric circle method” or the “quadrant method,” HEW was able to ascertain the distribution \n  of the various social and ethnic populations in question as well as the proximity of those populations to the \nDelaware Division and to the proposed Southwest Division. \nSimply stated, the concentric circle method of analysis entails drawing a series of concentric circles, all the points of \nwhich are equidistant from the center, with the focal point being either the Delaware Division or the Southwest \nDivision. Then, using census data, one can determine how many persons live within the radius of a given number of \nmiles of either location. The quadrant method entails dividing New Castle County into four separate quadrants with \nthe City of Wilmington serving as the focal point. The four quadrants, Viz., Northwest (Greenville); Northeast \n(Brandywine); Southwest (Stanton, Middletown, Elsmere); and Southeast (New Castle), are then associated with \ntheir appropriate zip code zones. From this, the population of each quadrant is calculated; the difference between \nthe four quadrant population and the total county population is then attributed to Wilmington itself.

In measuring the impact of existing modes of transportation on the access \n  problem, the Secretary considered (1) the transportation matrix and (2) the transit services. Based on an analysis of \nthe results of traffic studies conducted by WMC in cooperation with the Delaware Department of Highways and \nTransportation, the Secretary found that by 1980 traffic congestion on the major alternate routes leading to the \nSouthwest Division will pose a major problem in terms of access to that facility. Compounding the problem is the \nfact that private and public transit services are “speculative as to their feasibility” and cannot be considered reliable \nsources  for  patients,  visitors  and  employees  needing  transportation  services  to  reach  the  Delaware  or  the \nSouthwest Divisions.

Reliance on a bus or taxi is basically restricted to the urban center. The data, however, \nuniformly show that compared to the general population a greater percentage of minority and elderly patients, \nvisitors  and  employees  travel  to  the  urban  hospital  as  pedestrians  or  by  public  modes  of  transportation. \nInvestigative Report at 282-301. \n \n119  Docket Item 203, HEW’s Answers to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Set of Interrogatories, Ans.

If  the  data  prove  the \ntransportation system falls below the minimum capacity necessary to ensure the accessibility of all persons to the \nresources offered at either division, the hospital is then obligated to make an appropriate expansion in the system. \nThis amply protects against the plaintiffs’ claim that the plan is insufficient to meet the potential need; if that claim \n56 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \nis ultimately proven accurate, OCR’s quarterly review will lead to an appropriate modification. \n \n125  See Letter of Findings at 8-9. \n \n \n126  See Investigative Report at 282-86. \n \n \n127  Id. at 239-40, 334.

Id. par. 11(b). \n \n160  Contract at 15-16, par. 12. Specifically, WMC is required to exert its best efforts to cause any trust agreement \n  entered into by the Delaware Health Facilities Authority in connection with the financing of Plan Omega to require \nthe trustees thereunder to place the 2.8 million dollars in a separate account, “the principal of which is to be \nexpended only in payment of costs incurred in the renovation of the Delaware Division to the end that such \nrenovation shall remain financially feasible and shall be effected.” Alternatively, WMC may “create out of WMC \nfunds an escrow fund” in the requisite amount to be spent solely on the renovation project. Id. pars. 12(a) and (b). \n \n161  Id. par. 12(d) (emphasis added). The contract further provides that a failure to complete the renovation within the \n  three-year period “shall be deemed to be a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” Id. \n \n162  See Contract par. 7(n), Ex. B; Docket Item 20C, Ex. S-12. \n \n \n163  For a detailed list of each item WMC proposes to renovate at the Delaware Division under Plan Omega, see Exhibit \n \n62 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \nB-1 to WMC’s Supplemental Section 1122 Application, Docket Item 185, Ex. S3-1. \n \n164  Also, the record indicates that the Secretary was aware of the fact that specific renovation projects had been \n  effected at the Delaware Division before the contract of assurances was executed. These and other proposed \nrenovations  were  to  be  financed  from  funds  available  under  WMC’s  Annual  Construction  Project  Forecast. \nMoreover, WMC has averred that monies in excess of the 2.8 million dollars set aside under the contract for \nadditional renovations will be obtained from unrestricted investment funds, See Docket Item 185 at 11-12 and Ex. \nS3-1, and there is no evidence of record which would discredit that averment. \n \n165  The record includes a report, apparently prepared by the Wilmington Division of Community Affairs, which shows \n  that in 1975 approximately 70 percent of WMC’s employees lived in Wilmington or to the north of the city and, \nhence, closer to the present urban location than to the proposed Southwest location. Moreover, about two-thirds of \nWMC’s unskilled and para-professional employees in the lower wage brackets, I. e., earning less than $8,000 per \nyear, reside in or near the city. The report concluded by suggesting that the “present effective relationship between \nthe (urban) labor market and the (Wilmington) Medical Center will deteriorate if the place of actual work is moved \n(to the Southwest location).” Ad.Rec. Ex. C-49 at C-751, 757. It is arguable, however, that the hospital-provided \ntransportation system will effectively offset the relative inaccessibility of the proposed Southwest location and, \ntherefore, preserve employment opportunities for the city’s labor force. \n \n166  Investigative Report at 124-25. \n \n \n167  Id. at 125. \n \n \n168  Contract at 16, par. 13. \n \n \n169  Id. at 13, par. 9 & Ex.

The transportation assurance also obligates WMC to expand the hours of its shuttle system in \n  order to accommodate those of its employees whose shifts begin or end during the late evening or early morning \nhours. Id. The plaintiffs’ repeated contention that the contract fails to provide transportation for employees on \nweekends and during evening hours is thus plainly refuted by its terms. \n \n171  See 45 C.F.R. s 80.8(a)(1) & (2); Docket Item 231 at 91-92. The plaintiffs’ assertion that HEW’s only remedy for \n  breach of the contract is to cut off federal funds is plainly false. The regulations contemplate reference to the \nDepartment of Justice for appropriate action including a proceeding for specific performance. This obviously \ncomports with the Congressional desire to end discrimination, rather than to end federal assistance. See e. g., 110 \n63 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v...., 453 F.Supp. 280 (1978)   \n \n \nCong.Rec. 13130 (remarks of Senator Ribicoff). \n \n172  Performance of the assurances in the contract is intended to and will directly benefit the minority and handicapped \n  persons represented by the plaintiffs. Thus, those persons are third party beneficiaries of the contract and may sue \nfor specific performance of it, even though they are not named in the contract.

WMC, Inc., 453 F.Supp. 330 (D.Del.1978), \n  which rejected the plaintiffs’ claims that HEW’s failure to provide the plaintiffs a hearing during its administrative \ninvestigation of possible Title VI and Section 504 violations contravened the due process clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. These due process claims had first been raised by the plaintiffs in their second amended complaint, \nfiled November 22, 1977. (D.I. 197). Although both the June 21 and the April 7 opinions were appealed to the Third \nCircuit together, the Court of Appeals, because of its finding that the plaintiffs had a right to a trial de novo under \nTitle VI and Section 504, found it unnecessary to decide the due process issue. \nIn a later opinion, handed down in a different but related action, this Court also rejected various challenges \n35 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nmounted against HEW’s approval of Omega under Section 1122.

See, generally, 45 C.F.R. ss 80, 84, and 90. While the relief requested \nin the present case and the nature of the evidence presented would allow this Court only to enjoin a particular \ncourse of action, HEW, on the other hand, can impose a wide range of affirmative remedies. Moreover, HEW has a \ngreat  deal  of  flexibility  to  vary  any  requirements  if  changing  circumstances  would  so  warrant.  Indeed,  the \ninstitutional competence of HEW is much greater for this essentially administrative task than that possessed by a \ncourt. See, Atlantis Community, Inc. v. Adams, 453 F.Supp. 825 (D.Colo.1978). Although the role of the courts has \nexpanded greatly in recent years, this expansion has not and should not lead to the eclipse of the administrative \nfunctions of the executive branch. In the instant case, as is generally true, the appropriate function of the court \nshould be to review administrative action carried out by the executive branch, not to undertake that administrative \nfunction itself. See, Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 408, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1872). \n \n87  In NAACP v. WMC, Inc., 453 F.Supp. 280, 310-330 (D.Del.1978), this Court had occasion to describe the terms of the \n  Supplemental Agreement in detail. \n \n88  PX 2, P 7. \n \n \n89  PX 2, P 12. Failure to complete renovations within the three year period will constitute a prima facie violation of the \n  civil rights acts. This categorical obligation differs somewhat from other obligations imposed by the contract in that \nsince the term “renovation” is totally undefined, there is uncertainty as to the exact nature of the obligation. WMC \nhas taken the position that it is required only to renovate those areas relating to patient care in such a way as to \nmake the Delaware Division equal to the Southwest Division in its capacity to deliver such care. It further contends \nthat all such renovations can be completed with the expenditure of the $2.8 million which it must set aside. The \nplaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the two divisions must be made equal in all respects, even where a \nrenovation in the Delaware Division would not be cost effective and, in the judgment of plaintiffs’ own expert, ought \nnot be made. The Court believes that a rule of reason should prevail and that the renovations intended are those \n42 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nthat will assure equal ability to deliver patient care in surroundings that are equally safe and pleasant. \n \n90  PX 2, PP 10 and 11. \n \n \n91  PX 2, P 1. \n \n \n92  PX 2, P 4. \n \n \n93  PX 2, P 2. \n \n \n94  PX 2, P 8. \n \n \n95  PX 2, P 6. \n \n \n96  PX 2, P 13. \n \n \n97  PX 2, P 3. \n \n \n98  Tr. 112. \n \n \n99  Tr. 114-115; Dr. Brown admitted that projecting population changes in Delaware because of its small geographical \n  area is difficult.

An examination of some statistics \nreadily reveals why the plaintiffs’ extrapolation cannot be made. According to PX 176, the elderly population of New \nCastle County is 38,530 while the rest of the population numbers 460,963. (PX 176, Table P-1). This works out to a \nratio of 11.96 non-elderly to 1 elderly person. Even if an elderly person were six times as likely as a non-elderly \nperson to be handicapped, only one third of the handicapped population would be composed of elderly people. \nSince 66% of the elderly population lives in the Wilmington/Elsmere area and the northern suburbs (D.I. 408, pp. \n36-37), plaintiffs have shown only that at least 22% of the handicapped live in areas closer to the Delaware Division. \nEven if the elderly were 10 times more likely to be handicapped, plaintiffs would have shown only that 30% of the \nhandicapped live closer to the Delaware Division. Table 14 of DX 3 contains statistics showing the distribution of \nmobility limitations among different age groups. From these figures, one can derive the facts that only 31% of those \nwho are limited in activity are elderly, 29.8% of those limited in amount or kind of major activity are elderly, and \n53.6% of those unable to carry on major activity are elderly. Thus, given the 66% figure, plaintiffs have succeeded \nonly in showing that 20.7%, 19.7%, and 35.4%, of those categories, respectively, live nearer to the Delaware Division \nthan to the Southwest Division. \n \n117  PX 45d. \n \n \n118  PX 176, Table P-1. \n \n \n119  PX 176, Table P-4. \n \n \n120  PX 323, p. 37. \n \n \n121  DX 25, Table (D). \n \n \n122  PX 323, p. 37; Tr. 2157. \n \n \n123  PX 323, p. 37. \n \n \n45 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n124  DX 25, Table (D). \n \n \n125  See, location on PX 299. \n \n \n126  97% of WMC’s inpatients arrive by private vehicle (DX 25, Table (D)). \n \n \n127  PX 45c. \n \n \n128  PX 201. \n \n \n129  PX 45c. \n \n \n130  PX 301, Table 4. \n \n \n131  Its routes are shown on the map, PX 305. \n \n \n132  Pretrial Order, Appendix A, P 4(b).

The Court has, of course, found otherwise. Many of the opinions were \npremised on misunderstandings of WMC’s present situation and of its plans for Omega. \n \n149  The location of obstetric and pediatric inpatient services at the Southwest Division is the “catch-22” of the Omega \n  Plan. Given the heavy minority utilization of these services, their location in the Delaware Division would contribute \n47 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nconsiderably to the racial identifiability of that division. Such racial identifiability can best be avoided by locating \nthose services in the suburbs. However, this solution results in the location of those services most needed by the \ninner city population in the location farthest away from that population. Plaintiffs contend that because of this, \nOmega is inherently flawed and could only be made nondiscriminatory by a different allocation of bed numbers. \nDefendants claim that other measures which have and will be taken not only obviate the problems but will result in \na marked improvement of care. \n \n150  Supra. \n \n \n151  PX 43; Tr. 620. \n \n \n152  Tr. 714-715, 718-719, 725, 727-733. \n \n \n153  Tr. 849. \n \n \n154  Tr. 848. \n \n \n155  Tr. 867. \n \n \n156  Tr. 861-863, 894. \n \n \n157  Tr. 862-863. \n \n \n158  Tr. 867-876. While this description is framed in terms of comparisons between minorities and whites, it would be \n  more accurate to frame it in terms of comparisons between economic classes. The characteristics attributed to \nwhites are actually those of the well-to-do while those attributed to minorities are actually those of the poor. If one \ncompared minority and white groups from identical socio-economic niches, the differences in infant mortality rates \nwould be practically no different with the exception that even then minority infants would be somewhat more likely \nto be classified as premature. (Tr. 714, 718-719). Because minorities are more likely than whites to be poor, \ndifferences caused by socio-economic factors appear as differences between the races. \nOne might question whether impacts for which poverty is primarily responsible can be considered adverse impacts \nunder Title VI. The short answer to this is that in the United States, both now and at the time Title VI was passed, \npoverty and minority status were deemed so closely correlated as to be almost indistinguishable. Thus actions \n48 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nadversely impacting the poor will almost invariably adversely impact upon minority groups. The fact that the \ndisparate impact is caused by socio-economic differences between the races rather than genetic ones is irrelevant. \n \n159  Tr. 864. \n \n \n160  PX 288, Table 14; PX 293; PX 294. \n \n \n161  Tr. 718. \n \n \n162  PX 297. \n \n \n163  See, discussion supra. \n \n \n164  PX 288, Table 11; Tr. 716. \n \n \n165  PX 288, Table 11; Tr. 716-717. \n \n \n166  PX 4e. \n \n \n167  PX 414, Table M, revised. \n \n \n168  PX 84, p. 88. \n \n \n169  PX 289; Tr. 721-726. \n \n \n170  PX 4e; Tr. 743-744. \n \n \n49 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n171  Tr. 1943-1945, 2049-2053, 2158, 2208-2209, 2212-2215, 2272-2278, 2325-2328, 2383-2385; DX 6. \n \n \n172  Although plaintiffs argue their racial identifiability point in the section of their brief dealing with discriminatory \n  intent, racial identifiability can be itself a discriminatory impact as well as evidence of intent to discriminate.

No intent is required. 45 C.F.R. s 80.3(b)(1) specifies \nthat recipients of federal funds may not: \n(i) deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; \n(ii) provide any service . . . or other benefit to an individual which is different, or as provided in a different \nmanner, from that provided to others under the program; \n(iii) subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service . . \n. or other benefit under the program; \n(iv) restrict the individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving \nany service . . . or other benefit under the program. \n50 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n45 C.F.R. s 80.3(b)(2) provides: \n(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services . . . or facilities which will be provided under any such program \n. . . or the situations in which, such services . . . or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class \nof individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not . . . utilize criteria or \nmethods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, \ncolor, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin. \n45 C.F.R. s 80.3(b)(3) provides: \n(3) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the \neffect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any \nprograms to which this regulation applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or \neffect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation. \nOn July 5, 1973, every federal agency published amendments to their regulations, in part, to ensure that each \nagency had a provision similar to 45 C.F.R. s 80.3(b)(3), prohibiting site location decisions having disparate impacts \nupon minorities. \nHEW’s implementing regulations for Section 504 also apply a disparate impact standard. See, 45 C.F.R. s 84.4. These \nregulations apply specifically to site location decisions. See, 45 C.F.R. s 84.4(b)(5). \nWhile HEW’s Section 6102 regulations are not quite as explicit, they clearly apply to actions taken without \ndiscriminatory intent.

The majority in \nHarris expressly reserved the question of whether Title VI employs an impact standard. Even the dissent in Harris \ndoes not unambiguously reject the impact test. While they would have had the court hold that the notion of \ndiscrimination embodied in Title VI and all parallel statutes is the same as that embodied in the Fourteenth \nAmendment, and hence requires a showing of intent, they also intimated that intent may be determined by use of \nan impact test. They suggested that the Title VII test, the original impact test, is merely a “procedural mechanism . . . \ndesigned to provide a means of inferring an employer’s motive in the absence of direct evidence.” 100 S.Ct. at 381, \nn. 10. See, Perry, Michael, “The Disproportionate Impact Theory of Racial Discrimination,” 125 U.Penn.L.Rev. 540 \n(1977). \n51 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n \n181  In finding that WMC had no intent to discriminate, the Court has been guided by the discussion of that issue in \n  Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 141-145 (C.A.3, 1977), cert. denied, Whitman Area Improv. Council \nv. Resident Advisory Board, 435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978). In Rizzo, the circuit court enumerated \nseveral factors that should be considered in making a determination of whether or not a given action was taken with \nan “invidious discriminatory purpose.” In addition to any direct evidence of intent, the reviewing court should \nconsider: \n(1) discriminatory impact; \n(2) the historical background of the attacked decision; \n(3) the “sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision”; \n(4) departures from “normal procedural sequences”; and \n(5) departures from normal substantive criteria. \nId. at 143. \nHaving carefully considered these factors and having carefully examined the record, the Court is convinced that the \nevidence is overwhelming that WMC not only lacked an intent to discriminate but was actually motivated by \nconcern for the welfare of its urban and minority patients during the planning of Omega. \nFirst, the record is utterly devoid of any direct evidence of discrimination. While plaintiffs point to a few isolated \nstatements made in the course of the ten-year planning effort, the Court finds that those statements fail to show \nany discriminatory purpose. To the contrary, one such statement shows that WMC was aware of the necessity for \nplanning for the special health care needs of the inner city poor. (See, PX 31h, pp. 3-4). Others, when read in \ncontext, fail to show any intent to discriminate. (See, PX 33e, p. 4). \nSecondly, the Court has found that Omega as amended by the Supplemental Agreement will have minimal \ndiscriminatory impacts at best. The discriminatory impacts of Omega without the Supplemental Agreement might \nhave been greater. HEW found that without the Agreement, WMC would have been in violation of Title VI. \nHowever, any inference of intent to discriminate that may be raised by this fact is dissipated by the fact that WMC \nquickly and voluntarily entered into a burdensome contract of assurances that HEW found would eliminate any \ndiscriminatory effects. \nThe historical background of the decision to implement Omega also fails to show any intent to discriminate. WMC \nengaged in a ten-year planning process in which it investigated almost 50 different plans or variations thereof. (Tr. \n1580-1606; DX 7). Many of those plans were developed and analyzed at high cost by professional hospital planning \nconsultants. (Tr. 1380-1384). WMC’s Board of Directors, in making its decisions, paid careful attention to the \nconclusions  of  these  experts,  as  well  as  the  recommendations  of  WMC’s  Medical-Dental  staff  and  WMC’s \nadministration. (See, generally, testimony of Joseph Dallas, Tr. 1371-1384, and testimony of John Fulenwider, Tr. \n1550-1574). The plans actually studied included plans placing the bulk of beds in the city, plans placing the bulk of \nbeds in the suburbs, and plans dividing beds evenly between the city and the suburbs. The number of plans in each \nof the three categories is roughly equal. (See, DX 7). Moreover, at one time or another, the administration \nadvocated the implementation of at least one plan falling into each category. Health care planning expert Richard \nJames Coffey, after examining the history of WMC’s planning effort, concluded that that effort was identical to his \nown model of a perfect, rational hospital planning process in all respects but three. He found it departed from his \nmodel in that: (1) WMC put an artificial constraint upon itself by committing itself to the maintenance of at least one \n52 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nfacility in the city; (2) WMC failed to evaluate all alternatives at the same time; and (3) WMC engaged in an overly \nlong planning process. (Tr. 1994-2011). One of the deviations from the ideal planning process mentioned by Dr. \nCoffey was, in part, the result of WMC’s concern for continuing to provide service in the city for the city’s minority \npopulations. The other two factors do not show an intent to discriminate. The length of the planning process is \nexplained both by changes in demographic projections which necessitated changes in WMC’s planning goals (Tr. \n1411, 1565-1566) and by the fact that WMC deemed it necessary to give in-depth consideration to a plan proposed \nby the City of Wilmington which would have located the bulk of WMC’s facilities in the city. (Tr. 1380-1382). The \nfailure to compare all plans at one time is explainable in light of the fact that most other plans had been considered \nexhaustively over a number of years at great cost and had been rejected at the time of investigation as impractical. \nThe reasons for rejection seemed to the Board members to apply still at the time Omega was presented. (Tr. 1449, \n1504, 2486, 2034). Plaintiffs appear to argue that WMC’s awareness and consideration of the demographic \ncharacteristics of New Castle County indicates racially motivated decision-making. All witnesses, both those of the \nplaintiffs and those of the defendant, agreed that it is essential to consider demographic characteristics especially \nthe location of minority populations in hospital planning. (See, e. g., Plaintiffs’ Post Trial Opening Brief, D.I. 408, p. \n193). Thus, the history of WMC’s planning effort gives absolutely no indication of an intent to discriminate. \nExamination of the “sequence of events leading up to the challenged decisions” and any possible “departures from \n‘normal procedural sequences’ ” fails to show any intent to discriminate. Upon examining the procedures employed \nby WMC, Dr. Coffey found them normal with the three exceptions noted earlier. (Tr. 1994-2011). The Court has \nfound that these exceptions were due to factors unrelated to discrimination. The plaintiffs have made much of the \nfact that Omega itself was developed in approximately a month’s time. The Court does not find this unusual in light \nof the explanation given by Oliver Deehan, WMC’s in-house planner. The plan was developed as a result of an \nintense effort, carried out in conjunction with outside expert architects, and was built upon the data developed by \nthe many earlier plans. (Tr. 1709-1714,1803-1804). Thus, these two criteria reveal no intent to discriminate. \nThe final criteria mentioned in Rizzo is “departures from normal substantive criteria.” This factor is similar to \ndefendant’s  burden  of  proof  in  an  impact  test  need  for  the  discriminatory  plan  and  unavailability  of  less \ndiscriminatory alternatives. This Court has found infra that Omega is a response to legitimate health care objectives \nand that no alternatives other than Omega have been demonstrated which could meet those objectives. Thus, the \nCourt has found no significant departures from normal substantive criteria. \nOverall, the Court finds the evidence of lack of discriminatory intent or purpose overwhelming. While plaintiffs have \naddressed other pieces of evidence which, they contend, point to discriminatory intent, the Court finds their \ncontentions without merit. \n \n182  In the foregoing discussion the Court has adopted the reasoning found in the dissent in Sweeney. A close reading of \n  the case reveals that the dissenters and the majority were in agreement that the shifting burden was the burden of \ngoing forward. The difference between the two groups lay only in their interpretations of the language used by the \nlower court. This interpretation of Sweeney was apparently adopted by the Third Circuit in Kunda v. Muhlenberg \nCollege, supra. \n \n183  Title VI, itself, could be applied to a wide range of entities and to an equally diverse range of decisions. For that \n  reason, the nature of the justification required might vary in other cases. \n \n53 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n184  For example, WMC selected Omega from among the almost fifty alternatives with which it was presented. \n \n \n185  The availability of feasible alternatives is itself, of course, a means of showing that the asserted needs are only \n  pretexts. \n \n186  “The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in sections 90.14 \n  and 90.15 is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.” 45 C.F.R. s 90.16. \n \n187  See also, HEW responses to comments on its regulations, 44 Fed.Reg. 33782-33783 (June 12, 1979). \n \n \n188  Tr. 164-395. \n \n \n189  The plaintiffs in their briefs have also asserted that the mere fact that minorities will have to use the shuttle bus will \n  be a burden because it will cause the users to be exposed to contagious diseases. This is unsupported on the record. \nThere is no evidence showing that a person riding the shuttle will face a greater risk of contagion than does a person \nriding a DART bus to and from the Delaware Division today. \n \n190  PX 2, P 1. \n \n \n191  Tr. 2631-2632. \n \n \n192  Tr. 2647. \n \n \n193  Tr. 2642-2647. \n \n \n194  Although a separate analysis was not done for the elderly, the impact upon the elderly should mirror the impact \n  upon minorities, since elderly distribution and lack of access to transportation mirrors those characteristics in the \nminority population. \n \n195  PX 239, 240, 243, 245, 246, 248, 249, 250, and 251. \n \n54 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n \n196  The plaintiffs focus only upon those individuals whose position will be changed by Omega because they will have to \n  use hospital beds located at the Southwest Division rather than the city. While in many cases this emphasis might be \nproper, in this case, it distorts the picture. Omega is, in a large part, a reaction to the reality that major population \nshifts to the southwest have occurred within the county. Therefore, in order to serve the overall population best, \nsome beds must be located in the suburbs. All parties agree on that point. However, if one measures only those \naffected by the move, even a relocation of 200 beds, which the plaintiffs advocate, would have a discriminatory \nimpact. In a relocation of 200 beds, conceivably some inner city blacks would have to travel to Stanton. The impact \non the small number affected would appear as a disparate impact. \n \n197  Blacks are much more heavily represented among clinic users than they are among inpatients. \n \n \n198  This should be done for another reason, as well. The effects of increased travel time will be felt differently by the \n  different categories of users. Visitors will be much more likely to be deterred from traveling to a hospital by an \nincrease in travel time than will those seeking medical care. There are similar differences between those who seek \nprimary care at clinics and those referred by a physician to a medical facility or those seeking inpatient care. \nAccording to WMC’s expert Dr. Thorpe, the patient seeking primary clinical care is more likely to be deterred by \nincreases in travel time. (Tr. 2273-2275, 2293-2294). \nThe error of lumping all categories of users together is illustrated by the fact that if this approach were adopted \nwhen measuring racial identifiability, the Delaware Division would be racially identifiable under Omega even if it had \nno minority inpatients. (On Table S in DX 25, Mr. Tyler presented the number of daily clinic users broken down by \nrace. If one uses that number and assumes that all 250 beds were filled with whites, one would get a minority \npresence of 31%. This actually understates the percentage that would be derived, since inpatient occupancy is \nactually only approximately 85% (Tr. 595) and since Mr. Tyler derived his daily figure incorrectly. He divided the total \nnumber of clinic visitors during the 90-day study by 90 rather than by the number of weekdays. Clinics are held only \non weekdays.) \n \n199  All tables and figures are taken from DX 25 and restate Table T found therein. The methodology used is the same as \n  that described by Mr. Tyler. Where two numbers are given, this reflects the fact that Dr. Manheim often stated his \nnumbers in ranges to reflect uncertainty. When such ranges are given the lower numbers for one racial group \ncorrelate with the lower numbers for the other racial groups. This correlation extends throughout the range of \nnumbers.

Plaintiffs have not \nshown any such funds. Title VI has been construed to apply to employment practices where discrimination in \nemployment affects the programs for which funds have been given.

While Dr. Hardy testified that the increase in travel time necessary to reach the specialty OB clinics \n  would also delay the initiation of care, the Court finds otherwise. Care would, in all cases, be initiated at the general \nOB clinics at the Delaware Division and then, if a woman’s condition warranted it, her doctor would refer her to a \nspecialty clinic. Since all general OB clinics will be located at the Delaware Division, there should be no delays in the \ninitiation of care. \n \n208  See, Facts, supra. \n \n \n209  See, the Facts section of this opinion, supra. \n \n \n210  Tr. 530-532. \n \n \n211  The witness did testify that a majority of DAST trips either originated or ended in Wilmington. This, however, is \n  apparently because so many of the county’s businesses and services are located there and not because the \nhandicapped are concentrated in the area.

(D.I. 408 at 49-50). The basis for these contentions is pure speculation and the Court does not find them \ncredible.  As  noted  earlier,  the  Court  finds  that  WMC  will  abide  by  the  Supplemental  Agreement  since \nnon-compliance will automatically invoke the same penalties that this Court could now impose. \n58 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n \n214  The Supplemental Agreement, of course, requires that minority inpatient utilization of the Delaware Division not \n  exceed 25%. However, since only 13% of New Castle County’s population is minority, it is entirely possible that a \ndisproportionately high number of minority inpatients (any number greater than 13%) could be located at the \nDelaware Division without that Division being deemed racially identifiable. \n \n215  PX 45a, p. 48; see also, PX 23a. \n \n \n216  Plaintiffs adduced testimony that this would occur even if the minority presence at the Delaware Division remains \n  below 25%. (Tr. 592). \n \n217  PX 52b, P 37(a). \n \n \n218  This has not been established by the testimony. During the day, white suburbanites commute into Wilmington to \n  work. Any emergencies, such as heart attacks, that occur in that population during the day would be treated in the \nDelaware Division. (Tr. 1458). Plaintiffs’ experts based all admission and use projections upon the racial living \npatterns only. (DX 3, p. 24). Because Emergency Room admissions will depend upon where the emergency occurs \nand not upon where the patient lives, the Court cannot find that plaintiffs have established that the Delaware \nDivision Emergency Room will be used disproportionately by minorities. \n \n219  Tr. 1274-1275. \n \n \n220  Tr. 1384-1385. \n \n \n221  Tr. 1457-1458. \n \n \n222  In DX 14, Mr. Deehan, WMC’s planner, presented the following list of projects authorized, completed and/or in \n  progress between 1969 and 1979 relating to the Delaware Division.

Their expert, Mr. Juster, testified at length that sprinklers would not really be necessary and they often did \nnot accomplish what they were supposed to accomplish in any case. Only upon prompting by counsel did Mr. Juster \n“guess” that sprinklers “might” be necessary to make the Delaware Division equal to the Southwest Division. Given \nthe weakness of his reply when contrasted to his cogent, unprompted earlier discussion and given the fact that \nsprinklers have been or are being installed in the areas where they are important for safety, the Court concludes \nthat complete sprinklering is not necessary to make the Delaware Division equal to the Southwest Division.

In fact, at least $9 to $10 million in unrestricted funds will be available to pay for renovations \n  outright. That would mean that at least $5 million would be available for any office space renovation even if these \nunrestricted funds were used exclusively for the renovation of the patient care related spaces. If more money were \nneeded, that could be supplied by the excess depreciation that would be generated by the new Southwest Division \nin the early years of Omega. \n65 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \nIn fact, the Court has found that the total cost of renovating the Delaware Division, exclusive of financing, will be \napproximately $14 million. If one multiplies the cost of the items which WMC is now completing by the project cost \nfigure of 1.37 used by Mr. Juster (Tr. 3306-3326), one can derive the amount of that total figure represented by \nprojects now underway. That figure is approximately $3.8 million. Thus, only approximately $10.2 million (including \nthe $2.8 million that must be set aside at the beginning of Omega under the Supplemental Agreement) in additional \nfunds will be necessary to complete all renovations. The sources identified by Mr. Tyler could readily meet those \nneeds. \n \n230  For example, plaintiffs presented strong evidence that Mr. Tyler overestimated patient days and hence revenues \n  under Omega. (Tr. 3204-3214; PX 14, Table K). \n \n231  Tr. 2401-2421. \n \n \n232  Tr. 1334-1337, 3046. His testimony that the Delaware Division would be inferior was apparently based on the \n  assumption that only $2.8 million would be expended for renovations. (Tr. 1260). \n \n233  Of course, the Court has also found that some of the work which Mr. Juster included in his cost estimate will be \n  unnecessary. \n \n234  Tr. 1716-1717. \n \n \n235  Tr. 2247; see also, Facts, supra. \n \n \n236  Tr. 2224-2225. \n \n \n237  PX 2, Ex.

Of course, if they did not, WMC would be required to take more stringent, perhaps compulsory \n  measures. \n \n244  See, DX 13. \n \n \n245  This contention is typical of many of the dire predictions which plaintiffs have developed for this case. Starting with \n  a single fact which, in itself, is plausible, plaintiffs build a scenario, on the basis of conjecture, which is wholly \nimplausible. For example, here, the plaintiffs have shown that doctors and patients will tend to prefer a newer, \nmore sophisticated hospital. This is perfectly plausible and supported by credible evidence. However, at this point \nplaintiffs, and occasionally their experts, depart from reality and develop the incredible forecast of doctors scurrying \nfrom the Delaware Division like rats from a sinking ship. Plaintiffs assume that because of the general preference for \na new hospital, doctors will flaunt the Supplemental Agreement and neither the WMC administration nor HEW will \nintervene. Moreover, plaintiffs ignore the pull of other hospitals which will remain in the city and the historical \npatterns relating to the location of doctors offices. \nBy repeating this pattern many times, plaintiffs have managed to construct predictions in which the Delaware \nDivision under Omega would be a truly substandard ghetto hospital. However, when subjected to scrutiny, this \npicture has an extremely limited basis in fact. If the actual facts which plaintiffs have developed are considered \nalone, their case appears to have very little substance. However, because they have forecast such horrendous \nconsequences, the Court is required to consider each of them with the consequence that even this opinion may give \nthe impression that, overall, minorities will be disadvantaged by Omega. The Court, after careful consideration of \nthe facts and examination of the record as a whole disagrees emphatically. \n \n246  Tr. 1935-1941. \n \n \n247  Tr. 1943-1945, 2208-2209. \n \n \n248  Tr. 1943-1945, 2208-2209. \n \n \n249  Tr. 1943-1945. \n \n67 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n \n250  Tr. 1974. \n \n \n251  Tr. 2377.

This would seem to apply to cases where a lesser benefit is \nconferred on minorities than is conferred on whites. However, a violation could be found only when the benefit is \n“substantially” less. Indeed, it is almost impossible to imagine an act which would have an absolutely equal effect \nupon all the different groups into which a society may be divided. \n \n259  Tr. 2135-2137. \n \n \n68 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n260  Tr. 2156. \n \n \n261  Tr. 906-907. \n \n \n262  Tr. 2158. \n \n \n263  Tr. 1973-1974. \n \n \n264  Tr. 2052-2053, 2158. \n \n \n265  Tr. 937-947. \n \n \n266  Tr. 2141-2144. \n \n \n267  Tr. 862-864, 867, 894.

(Tr. \n1580-1606; DX 7). The Court need not and could not examine all less discriminatory alternatives.

Those spaces could then not be used to house office space or outpatient areas, which are located \nthere under Omega at a cost considerably lower than the cost of placing them in new construction. \n \n339  PX 1, p. 6-15. \n \n \n340  Id. \n \n \n341  Although  plaintiffs  produced  other,  lower  estimates,  including  a  preliminary  estimate  made  by  Metcalf  and \n  Associates before their more detailed study, the Court finds that the scopes of the studies producing these \nestimates were so limited as to make the estimates unreliable. \n \n342  Tr. 3301-3302. \n \n \n343  Tr. 1487-1497, 1994-1995, 3266-3268, 3344-3347. \n \n \n344  PX 1, p. 6-14; Tr. 1487-1497. The Court has found Omega to be inherently less costly for a slightly different reason \n  from that expressed in the foregoing sources. The Court finds Omega less costly because it requires less costly types \nof renovations. The sources just cited believed it to be less costly because of a misguided belief that renovation \nwould be inherently more costly. \n \n75 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v...., 491 F.Supp. 290 (1980)   \n \n \n345  Tr. 3030-3050. \n \n \n346  Mr. Juster’s estimates are found in his two reports, PX 317 and PX 411.

At the Southwest division, the following services would be provided: gastroenterology, nephrology, \n24 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R.

The Delaware division will exclusively house the psychiatry, ear, eye, \nand nose, and dentistry specialties. The primary care clinics will be consolidated and located exclusively at the \nDelaware division. \n \n3  The district court held that HEW’s decision was not arbitrary or capricious, NAACP v. The Medical Center, Inc., 453 \n  F.Supp. 280 (D.Del.1978), and that the plaintiffs had no private cause of action under Title VI or the Rehabilitation \nAct. We reversed the latter action, 599 F.2d 1247 (3d Cir. 1979). \n \n4  In addition, pediatric inpatient services are offered at the St. Francis and Riverside hospitals in Wilmington proper. \n \n \n5  The antidiscrimination provision of Title VI states: \n \n“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” \n42 U.S.C. s 2000d (1976). \n \n6  Whether intent or impact is sufficient to state a claim under Title VI and the issues surrounding hospital closings and \n  relocations have been the subject of scholarly commentary. See, e. g., Note, The Prima Facie Case and Remedies in \nTitle VI Hospital Relocation Cases, 65 Cornell L.Rev. 689 (1980); Note, Maintaining Health Care in the Inner City: Title \nVI and Hospital Relocations, 55 N.Y.U.L.

Medical Center, Inc.: The Evidentiary \nHearing Under Title VI, 24 St. Louis U.L.J. 579 (1980). \n \n7  But see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 648 F.2d 1164 (7th Cir. 1981), where it was held that disproportionate \n  impact alone does not establish a violation of Title VI. In Guardians Ass’n of New York City Police Dep’t, Inc. v. Civil \nService Commission, 633 F.2d 232, 254 (2d Cir. 1980), a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nconcluded that only intentional discrimination is actionable under Title VI. An earlier panel of the same court \ndisagreed, however, citing Lau’s impact test as authority after Bakke. Board of Education v. Califano, 584 F.2d 576, \n589 (2d Cir. 1978), aff’d on other grounds, Board of Education v. Harris, 444 U.S. 130, 100 S.Ct. 363, 62 L.Ed.2d 275 \n(1979). Still other panels have either acknowledged that Bakke did not expressly overrule Lau, see Parent Ass’n of \n25 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R.

Koch, 627 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1980). \n \n8  See, e. g., 7 C.F.R. s 15.3 (1980) (Agriculture Dep’t); 14 C.F.R. s 1250.103-1 (1981) (NASA); 18 C.F.R. s 1302.3 (1980) \n  (Tennessee Valley Authority); 45 C.F.R. s 1010.10-2 (1980) (Community Services Administration); 49 C.F.R. s 21.5 \n(1980) (Transportation Dep’t). \n \n9  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides: \n \n“No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, as defined in section \n706(7) of this title, shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance....” \n29 U.S.C. s 794 (Supp. II 1978). \nSection 303 of the Age Discrimination Act provides: \n“Pursuant to regulations prescribed under section 6103 of this title, and except as provided by \nsection 6103(b) and section 6103(c) of this title, no person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under, any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” \n42 U.S.C. s 6102 (1976). \n \n10  Over 87% of the minority residents and 76.3% of the elderly residents of New Castle County live in the northeast \n  area. Elderly and minority families near the Delaware facility are more likely than other families in the area to be \nwithout a car. 491 F.Supp. at 302-03. \n \n11  The district court, relying on 42 U.S.C. s 2000d-3, did not consider the impact of Omega on minority service \n  employees. The plaintiffs had contended that these employees would be assigned in a discriminatory fashion and \nthat this would exacerbate the racial identifiability of the Delaware division caused by discriminatory patient \nassignments. The argument was never made, however, that assignment of employees would itself result in racial \nidentifiability violative of Title VI. Given our affirmance of the district court’s finding that patient assignment would \nnot result in racial identifiability, it is not necessary to consider plaintiffs’ other argument. \n26 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R. Fed. 539 \n \n \n12  Judge Higginbotham would hold that plaintiffs did establish a prima facie case. \n \n \n13  The distinction between establishing a prima facie case and prevailing on the ultimate issue is discussed in IX J. \n  Wigmore, Evidence s 2487 (3d ed. 1940). There Professor Wigmore quotes extensively from Speas v. Merchants’ \nBank & Trust Co., 188 N.C. 524, 125 S.E. 398 (1924): \n“A ‘prima facie’ case ... does not change the burden of proof. It only stands until its weight is \nmet by evidence to the contrary ... (A) ‘prima facie’ case ... need not be overcome by a \npreponderance of the evidence, or by evidence of greater weight; but the evidence needs \nonly to be balanced, put in equipoise ...; and if this be done, the burden of the evidence has \nbeen met and the duty of producing further evidence shifts back to the party having the \nburden of proof.” \n \n14  As the Supreme Court noted in Teamsters v. United States, supra, 431 U.S. at 358, 97 S.Ct. at 1866. \n \n“The importance of McDonnell Douglas lies, not in its specification of the discrete elements of \nproof there required, but in its recognition of the general principle that any Title VII plaintiff \nmust carry the initial burden of offering evidence adequate to create an inference that an \nemployment decision was based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under the Act.” \n \n15  In Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra, the Court commented that the factual issues and therefore \n  the “character of the evidence presented” differ in effects cases but did not give any indication that a different \nburden would be imposed on the defendant. 450 U.S. at 252, at n.5, 101 S.Ct. at 1093 n.5. \n \n16  See generally, Hillman, Teamsters, California Brewers, and Beyond: Seniority Systems and Allocation of the Burden \n  of Proving Bona Fides, 54 St. John’s L.Rev. 706, 711-16 (1980). \n27 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R. Fed. 539 \n \n \n17  In intent cases, if the reasons put forth by the defendant are not his real ones and in fact mask his plan to \n  discriminate, the plaintiff may show the pretext. In impact cases, where no intent is alleged, the pretext may \nsometimes consist of a defendant’s assertion of a bona fide interest in order to conceal another nondiscriminatory \nreason for not adopting a less discriminatory plan. In other situations, business justification may be the only reason \nfor the decision. It nevertheless remains open to the plaintiff to show that other devices exist which also serve the \ndefendant’s legitimate interest but which do not manifest a similarly prejudicial effect. Indeed, “(s)uch a showing \nwould be evidence that the (defendant) was using its (device) merely ... as a ‘pretext’ for discrimination.” Albemarle \nPaper Co. v. Moody, supra 422 U.S. at 425, 95 S.Ct. at 2375. It may also be substantive evidence to support plaintiff’s \ncase. \n \n18  Judges Higginbotham and Sloviter would adopt the standard used by the district court that the discriminatory \n  impacts must be “justified by bona fide needs which could not be accomplished by any less discriminatory plan.” \n491 F.Supp. at 343. \n \n19  The record contains ample evidence supporting justification for such disparate effects as may exist as well as \n  demonstrating that other impacts asserted by plaintiffs will not take place. \n \n1  For a history and critique of health care planning, see Rosenblatt, Health Care Reform and Administrative Law: A \n  Structural Approach, 88 Yale L.J. 243 (1978). \n \n2  The majority and I agree with the district court that the plaintiffs did not establish a prima facie case with respect to \n  the handicapped under section 504. See maj. op. supra at 1331, 1332. \n \n3  The broad spectrum of federally funded programs in which Title VI challenges occur may account for the divergent \n  resolutions of the intent vs. impact question among and within the circuits. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 648 \nF.2d 1104 (7th Cir. 1981) (based on belief that a violation of Title VI requires an intentional discriminatory act, the \ncourt adopted the intent standard for Title IX); Guardians Association of the New York City Police Dept., Inc., etc. v. \nCivil Service Commission of the City of New York, 633 F.2d 232 (2d Cir. 1980) (intent required for Title VI); Bryan v. \nKoch, 627 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1980) (unnecessary to decide whether intent or effects standard applies to Title VI); \nBoard of Education v.

Failure to complete said renovation within said period \nshall be deemed to be a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nThe Supplemental Agreement does not, however, describe the nature or scope of the renovations, as the court itself \nconceded. 491 F.Supp. at 301 n.89. \n \n9  Paragraph (14) provides: \n \nThis agreement shall be subject to amendment from time to time by written instrument executed by the parties, \nto reflect such changes in systems for delivery of hospital care and of changing community needs. \n \n10  See NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., 453 F.Supp. 280, 453 F.Supp. 330 (D.Del.1978), rev’d, 599 F.2d 1247 \n  (3d Cir. 1979). The plaintiffs’ contentions, which the panel remanded for consideration, included inter alia “that the \nmodified plan was based on erroneous and inadequate findings....” 599 F.2d at 1250. \nIn their brief on this appeal, plaintiffs point to inadequacies in the HEW investigation which, they claim, undermine \nthe credibility of its acceptance of the Supplemental Agreement. HEW’s chief investigator admitted, for instance, \nthat the agency had not considered total patient days in accepting the patient assignment plan and thus did not \nconsider the over-occupancy consequence prior to its acceptance of Plan Omega. It was also conceded that no \nhealth experts were consulted or involved in the drafting or revision of the letter of findings or the negotiations \nleading to the Supplemental Agreement (Joint Appendix (JA) 1243-6, 1250). \n \n11  In a related context, the Court of Appeals in Bryan v. Koch, 627 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1980), implied that plaintiffs \n  challenging the shutdown of a municipal hospital had established a prima facie case of disparate impact where the \nCity’s estimates for alternative care “rest on projections made without sufficient assurance....” 627 F.2d at 617. \nAccordingly, the panel found it “appropriate” to complete an assessment of the plaintiffs’ Title VI claim by examining \n32 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R. Fed. 539 \n \nthe justification advanced by the City for closing the hospital. \n \n12  See note 1 supra. \n \n \n13  The court assumed, of course, that this would be financially feasible. See Part I(B)(2)(i) supra. \n \n \n14  Under Paragraph (6) of the Agreement, a division will be deemed racially identifiable if it shows “in excess of 25% \n  minority inpatient utilization” based upon patient days. \n \n15  However, reliance on the monitoring and enforcement capability of HEW, now HHS, may be unrealistic. See Wing, \n  Title VI and Health Facilities, 30 Hast.L.J. 137 (1978). \n \n16  See Part I(B)(2)(ii) supra. \n \n \n17  Maj. op. pp. 1336-1337. \n \n \n18  The district court assumed that this was the legal standard for justification of disparate impact. 491 F.Supp. at 340. A \n  plurality of this court, relying on Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972), hint that \nany inquiry into alternatives at all may be inappropriate in Title VI cases. However, at the time that case was \ndecided, the contours of Title VI’s obligations had not been litigated, 406 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 1746 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and the Court treated analysis under that statute and the fourteenth \namendment as being equivalent. 406 U.S. at 549-50 n.19, 92 S.Ct. at 1733 n.19. Subsequently, it handed down its \nlandmark opinion in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), deciding that Title VI, by itself, \nbarred disparate effects. Since the announcement in Lau that Title VI can require affirmative action, the question of \nhow much has remained open and is not controlled by Jefferson v. Hackney. \n \n19  The effect of this was to short-circuit the process of reasonable accommodation which Title VI is designed to foster. \n  Recognition by the trial court of such specific, discrete impacts as the absence of a high risk prenatal clinic at the \nDelaware Division and consideration of plaintiffs’ evidence of financial infeasibility might well have elicited from \nWMC more reassuring revenue projections or prompted it to fine-tune Plan Omega in ways which would remove or \nsufficiently mitigate the problems identified, without necessitating the inquiry into justification and the merits of \nReverse Omega or some alternative site. Indeed, WMC might have decided to rebut the prima facie case by \nadjusting the mix of services at their preferred site, for example, or by replacing generalized promises of adequate \nshuttle transportation with specific allocations of funds for expanded service or a concrete contingency plan \nsatisfying plaintiffs’ concerns. \n33 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R. Fed. 539 \n \n \n20  The opinion of the court contends that the district court did make findings with respect to the financial feasibility of \n  the Delaware Division renovations. That contention misses the point. It is clear that the district court refused to \ndecide the broader question on which renovation depends: i. e., whether Plan Omega taken as a whole is financially \nsound. \n \n21  The majority suggest that any financial inquiry is too speculative; yet they are willing to speculate, without any \n  supporting evidence presented at trial, that the bond market will arrest a flawed project or that bondholders will \nabide by the terms of the Supplemental Agreement in the event a shortage of revenue befalls the project and \nthreatens their security interest. On the other hand, if such optimism should prove unfounded, and a racially \nidentifiable hospital of inferior quality ensues, the only sanction available to federal authorities at that point will be \na cutoff of further funding. This does not help matters when the hospital is already financially strapped. Nor is there \nany assurance that the effects of a cut-off would be felt equally by the Stanton and Delaware Divisions. \n \n22  In Burdine the question for decision was the nature of an employer’s burden in an intent case. The Court began its \n  analysis by saying: \nIn McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), we set forth the basic \nallocations of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment. 5 \n5 We have recognized that the factual issues, and therefore the character of the evidence presented, differ when \nthe plaintiff claims that a facially neutral employment policy has a discriminatory impact on protected classes. \n(citations omitted). \n49 U.S.L.W. at 4215. The footnote w uld seem superfluous were it not construed as a signal that the evidence and \nthe issues in an impact case may warrant a different burden of proof analysis. \nNor is a unitary burden for all Title VII cases established by the other Supreme Court precedents. The footnote in \nNew York Transit Authority v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 587 n.31, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 1366 n.31, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979), did no \nmore than reaffirm the decision in Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 \n(1975), which in turn does not speak with the clarity attributed to it by the majority. Albermarle Paper Co. assigns \nplaintiffs, at most, the burden of proof on the existence of less discriminatory alternatives, an inquiry which is \nrelevant only to the extent that the defendant has first persuasively shown that it has compelling needs and that its \nproposed plan will feasibly meet those needs. But even that construction of Albermarle Paper Co. would be too \nbroad. The opinion can be read as simply acknowledging that plaintiffs who failed to prove a Griggs-type violation, \ncould  nonetheless  still  attempt  to  succeed  on  an  intent  theory  if  they  were  prepared  to  prove  that  less \ndiscriminatory alternatives existed and that, therefore, defendant’s justification was merely pretextual. 422 U.S. at \n425, 95 S.Ct. at 2375. This use of alternatives as circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus is standard in \nintentional discrimination cases. See Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 578, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2950, 57 \nL.Ed.2d 957 (1978). In contrast, the existence of alternatives to Plan Omega revealed in this litigation was not urged \nas evidence of pretext, but went directly to the question of whether the disparate impact of WMC’s proposed \nrelocation could be mitigated and, therefore, federal benefits better distributed. That is purely an impact issue and, \nas such, should remain part of the defendant’s burden of justification. \n \n34 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n For Advancement of Colored People v...., 657 F.2d 1322 (1981)   \n69 A.L.R. Fed. 539 \n \n23  Elsewhere, the court seemed to appreciate the distinction, but the net effect of its ambiguous focus on pretext is to \n  cast doubt on the court’s treatment of the evidence. Hopefully, the opinion of this court has at least relegated the \nconcept of “pretext” to its proper place. See Maj. op. p. 1336 n.17. \n \n24  Cf. Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Co., 421 F.2d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 1970) (Equal Pay Act) (“In cases such as this, where the \n  justification for the differential rests on economic benefit, the company has peculiarly within its knowledge the \nmeans of proof, and the burden therefore is one which cannot be satisfied by general or conclusory assertions.”) \n \n25  The difficulty of this task was at one point acknowledged by the district court. Although WMC submitted projections \n  for Reverse Omega which showed it to be more costly than Omega, plaintiffs argued that the cost differential was \ndue to the fact that the two plans did not contemplate equivalent facilities and services. In support of their \ncontention, plaintiffs’ key expert witness attempted to construct an estimate of what the Plan Omega hospitals \nwould cost if they were to match the hospitals Reverse Omega would create. Indeed, the court found that WMC \nnever had attempted to develop a plan for Reverse Omega using the same parameters that were used for Omega. \n491 F.Supp. at 343. Therefore, in order to properly compare the two plans, plaintiffs’ witness had to create an \n“Imaginary Omega.” However, the court found the expert’s projections unreliable, acknowledging, though, that this \nwas because “in devising his estimates, (the expert) relied upon documents that were never designed for the \npurpose of making the comparison he was attempting.” 491 F.Supp. at 344. \nA comparison among alternate plans using equivalent parameters would seem critical to proper determination of \nwhether defendants’ chosen alternative was unavoidable despite its disproportionate adverse effects. Assigning the \nburden of justification to the recipient of federal funds will help ensure that documents permitting such comparison \nare placed before the court. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n ",

The United States  Appellants brought this action under Title VI of the Civil \nDistrict  Court  for  the  District  of  Delaware,  James  L.  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  s  2000d  (1976),  and \nLatchum, Chief Judge, ruled that plaintiffs did not have a  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. s \nprivate cause of action under certain federal statutes, and  794 (1976), contending that a proposed health facility \nthey appealed.

At oral argument counsel committed \n  themselves to expediting the remaining discovery and to compressing the time required to try the merits of \nappellants’ claims. In light of what has already been accomplished by way of discovery, and in reliance on the \nrepresentations of counsel, we are confident that there will be no delays in bringing this case to an early final \ndecision. These observations are in no way intended to control the district court’s discretion in structuring or \nlimiting discovery or other pretrial procedures. \n \n3  The district court granted class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., and the class was designated as \n  follows: \n1. All black and Puerto Rican residents of Wilmington and other areas of New Castle County who are better served \nby the existing locations of the Wilmington Medical Center Incorporated (“Medical Center”); \n2. All handicapped residents of Wilmington and other areas of New Castle County who are better served by the \nexisting locations of the Medical Center. \n453 F.Supp. 280, 284 (D.Del.1978). \n \n4  WMC is the recipient of federal support which accounts for approximately 35% Of its total budget. WMC is sued \n  because it chose an allegedly discriminatory relocation site. The other defendants are all participants in the review \nprocess established by s 1122 of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. s 1320a-1 (1976), which is intended to screen \ncapital expenditure proposals for unnecessary expansion. They are charged with violating Title VI and section 504 \nbecause they allegedly officially sanctioned a discriminatory proposal by approving it during the course of the \nsection 1122 review. The inclusion of BCHP and HPC raises the issue of whether the rights guaranteed by Title VI and \nsection 504 can be violated by state agencies, even those which are supported in part by federal money, that are \nsimply engaged in the review contemplated by section 1122. The district court, in its opinion on the motion to \n7 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \ndismiss, reserved this question. (426 F.Supp. 919, 924). The issue was mooted by the district court’s eventual \ndisposition of the case, but may have to be reopened on remand. \n \n5  Under Plan Omega, two of WMC’s three inner-city divisions would be closed, and the third would be scaled down. \n  Presently, WMC maintains 1,104 beds, which constitute nearly 75% Of the acute care beds available in Wilmington \nand its metropolitan area. As a result of the proposed closing of city divisions under Plan Omega, WMC’s inner-city \nbed capacity would fall from 1,104 beds to 250 beds. A new facility, consisting of 800 beds, would be constructed at \na suburban site located about 8 miles southwest of the City. \nPlaintiffs assert, Inter alia, that WMC’s remaining inner-city division will become a “ghetto” hospital, that transferred \nacute care services will be virtually inaccessible, that a segregated dual hospital system will be created, and that the \nstaffing of the inner-city division will suffer qualitatively. \n \n6  HEW does not generally conduct Title VI and section 504 compliance reviews of health facility relocations. It is \n  engaged in several such reviews at present, all under court order. HEW has candidly admitted its inexperience and \ninadequate staffing in this area. Whether HEW has the resources necessary to engage in compliance review is not \ncritical to this appeal, however, since the plaintiffs now claim, and we agree (See n. 10 Infra ), that recourse to the \nadministrative remedy is not in any event a prerequisite to the assertion of the plaintiffs’ private cause of action. \nSee Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, —— n. 41, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1962, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \n \n7  The district court observed that failure to exhaust administrative remedies normally requires dismissal of the suit. \n  However, HEW regulations call for a Title VI investigation “whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any \nother information indicates a possible failure to comply” 45 C.F.R. s 80.7(c) (1978). Since the Complaint served by \nthe plaintiffs was sufficient “information” to require a Title VI investigation, the court directed HEW to initiate a \ncompliance review. 426 F.Supp. 919, 924 (D.Del.1977). \n \n8  The decision on the due process claim is separately reported at 453 F.Supp. 330 (D.Del.1978). \n \n \n9  In Gurmankin v. Costanzo, 556 F.2d 184 (3d Cir. 1977) we discussed, but were not compelled to decide, the question \n  of whether a private cause of action exists under section 504 and Title VI. Judge Rosenn has collected the authorities \nwhich hold that such a cause of action does exist under section 504. Doe v. Colautti, 592 F.2d 704 at 708 n. 8 (3d Cir. \n1979), Amended (Feb. 23, 1979). The question is now squarely before us. \n \n10  Since we hold that there exists a private cause of action under section 601 of Title VI which may be asserted without \n  preliminary recourse to agency remedial procedures, we need not reach the issue of what the appropriate agency \nprocedures would be in the absence of such a private action, (i. e., whether there is a right to a due process \nevidentiary hearing, whether there is a right to supplement the administrative record on review, and what the \nstandard of review of agency action is). \n8 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \nFurther, appellants may be aggrieved persons who have the right to seek judicial review of HEW’s determination \nthat Plan Omega complies with Title VI and section 504. We do not foreclose that right. However, since we are \nremanding the issue of Plan Omega’s compliance for a full trial on the merits, we will not review HEW’s approval of \nthe Plan, or the district court’s affirmance of that approval, at this time. Nor must we now decide whether \nappellants are aggrieved persons within the meaning of section 603 of Title VI. \n \n11  As noted in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 420-421 n. 28, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2815 n. 28, 57 \n  L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (Opinion of Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist): \n. . . (T)he principle embodied in s 601 involves Personal Federal rights that administrative procedures would not, for \nthe most part, be able to protect. The analogy to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, is clear. Both that Act \nand Title VI are broadly phrased in terms of personal rights (“no person shall be denied . . .”); both Acts were drafted \nwith broad remedial purposes in mind; and the effectiveness of both Acts would be “severely hampered” without \nthe existence of a private remedy to supplement administrative procedures. See Allen v. State Board of Elections, \n393 U.S. 544, 556, 89 S.Ct. 817, 826, 22 L.Ed.2d 1. In Allen, of course, (the Supreme) Court implied a private right of \naction under the Voting Rights Act. (emphasis in original). \n \n12  Section 602 provides, in relevant part: \n \nEach Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any program or \nactivity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed \nto effectuate the provisions of section 2000d of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, \nregulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the \nstatute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken. . . . Compliance with any \nrequirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to \ncontinue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding \non the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, . . . or (2) by any other \nmeans authorized by law: Provided, however, That no such action shall be taken until the department or agency \nconcerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has \ndetermined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. . . . \n \n13  Section 603 provides: \n \nAny department or agency action taken pursuant to section 2000d-1 of this title shall be subject to such judicial \nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by such department or agency on other \ngrounds. In the case of action, not otherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or refusing to grant or to \ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed pursuant to section \n2000d-1 of this title, any person aggrieved (including any State or political subdivision thereof and any agency of \neither) may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with section 1009 of Title 5, and such action shall not \nbe deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of that section. \n \n14  For example, Representative Celler observed during the congressional debate on Title VI: \n \n9 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \nThe bill would offer assurance that hospitals financed by Federal money would not deny adequate care to Negroes. . \n. . It would, in short, assure the existing right to equal treatment in the enjoyment of federal funds. \n110 Cong.Rec. 1519 (1964). \n \n15  “Further, Title VI provides very clearly that the person or the agency which is denied the money, if it desires, can go \n  to the courts . . . and that court can determine whether or not the cutoff is in accord with law and whether or not it \nwas properly done under this statute. Nowhere in this section do you find a comparable right of legal action for a \nperson who feels he has been denied his rights to participate in the benefits of Federal funds. Nowhere. Only those \nwho have been cut off can go to court and present their claim.” 110 Cong.Rec. 2467 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Gill). \n \n16  “. . . (T)he agency aggrieved, which would usually be a state or local government authority which had been recipient \n  of Federal assistance, could secure judicial review of the action taken by the Federal administrator in discontinuing \nor withholding financial assistance. . . . (A) good case could be made that a remedy is provided for the State or local \nofficial who is practicing discrimination, but none is provided for the victim of the discrimination.” Id. at 6562 \n(remarks of Sen. Kuchel). \n \n17  “Parenthetically, while we favored the inclusion of the right to sue on the part of the agency, the State, or the \n  facility which was deprived of Federal funds, we also favored the inclusion of a provision granting the right to sue to \nthe person suffering from discrimination. This was not included in the bill. However, both the Senator from \nConnecticut and I are grateful that our other suggestions were adopted by the Justice Department.” Id. at 7065 \n(remarks of Sen. Keating). \n \n18  WMC has also argued that congressional intent to deny a cause of action is demonstrated by the fact that Congress \n  did create such rights under Titles II and VII. According to WMC, the failure to do so under Title VI would at least \ncreate a “presumption” that no private action was intended for violations of Title VI. However, under both Title II \nand Title VII Congress provided for rights of action so that the exercise of those rights could be expressly conditioned \nby certain procedural limitations. The explicit creation of a cause of action so that it may be tied to procedural \nprerequisites is entirely consistent with the absence of an express provision for a cause of action under Title VI, and \ndoes not give rise to any “presumption” that such an action was denied. \n \n19  As Senator Ribicoff observed: “The principle of nondiscrimination is so undeniably sound that to my knowledge \n  there has not been one word said in opposition to this principle during the debate on this bill.” 110 Cong.Rec. 7064 \n(1964). \n \n20  Members of the House Committee which considered Title VI concluded that, “The policy underlying the enactment \n  of Title VI is so fundamentally correct that there is little need for an additional statement in its behalf. Section 601 \nconcisely announces this policy . . . .” H.R.Rep.No. 914, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 2 U.S.Code Cong. & \nAdmin.News, pp. 2355, 2391, 2510 (1964). In this regard, Senator Case observed, “I am very frank to state that \n10 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \nSection 601, which is a statement of substantive right (repeating the statute) means exactly what it is. It does not \nprovide a method of enforcement, by itself; but I suggest that it is complete.” 110 Cong.Rec. 5255 (1964). \nSimilarly, in a colloquy between Senators Humphrey and Talmadge, the undisputed nature of the underlying right \nwas made clear: \nSen. Humphrey: The Constitution requires that citizens of the United States be treated as citizens of the United \nStates. \nSen. Talmadge: That right is enforceable in every court of the land, and the Senator from Minnesota knows it. \nSen. Humphrey: That is correct. The existing law of the land is stated in Section 601. \nId. at 5254. \n \n21  110 Cong.Rec. 2463 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Whitener); Id. at 2464 (remarks of Rep.

Byrd). \n \n \n26  As Senator Case emphatically stated, “I wish to make clear that the words and provisions of section 601 and the \n  substantive rights established and stated in that section are not limited by the limiting words of section 602.” 110 \nCong.Rec. 5254 (1964). See Id. at 6562 (remarks of Senator Kuchel); Id. at 5254 (remarks of Senator Humphrey). \nThere were two concerns embodied in section 601 that discrimination existed and that such discrimination was \nbeing funded by the United States government. (See, e. g., 110 Cong.Rec. 2468 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Rodino)). \nThat congressional debate focused on the second issue should not obscure the fact that, while not incidental, the \nfunding issue was subordinate to the broader principle being established. \n11 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \n \n27  Within the legislative scheme, a beneficiary may trigger an agency investigation under section 602, and may, under \n  appropriate circumstances, petition for review of an agency determination. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 \nU.S. 677, —— n. 41, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1962, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). But a beneficiary may not otherwise sue an agency \nunder section 601 to compel termination of funds. Additionally, we now hold that a beneficiary may sue a recipient \nof federal funding under section 601 for a judicial declaration that the recipient’s conduct is in violation of section \n601. Such an action would allow the beneficiary to vindicate his section 601 rights without invoking the executive’s \npower to terminate funds. (If the trial court finds that the recipient is violating section 601, it may order the \nrecipient to cease the discriminatory practice. Alternatively, the recipient may decline federal funding and escape \nTitle VI’s jurisdictional predicate.) \nIt follows that the beneficiary may not sue the administrative agency under section 601. If the beneficiary were \nallowed to do so, it would be able to circumvent the limitations of sections 602 and 603, and would be in a position \nto, in essence, compel funding termination which is an impermissible result. This conclusion is in harmony with our \nanalysis of the legislative scheme. It does no harm to beneficiaries’ rights, as complete relief can be awarded \nwithout the agency being a party to the private suit, and complete discovery can be undertaken, since the agency \nhas no more relevant information to impart than does the funding recipient, who is a party. \n \n28  Much of the dispute turned on whether President Kennedy had actually favored or opposed Congress granting the \n  President wide discretion to order funding termination. See 110 Cong.Rec. 2463 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Whitener); \nId. at 2464 (remarks of Rep. Poff); Id. 5253 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey); Id. 6048 (remarks of Sen. Talmadge); Id. at \n5090 (remarks of Sen. Robertson). \n \n29  110 Cong.Rec. 2468 (1964) (Rep. Celler, identifying the need to “clarify and confirm” the executive power); Id. at \n  7067-68 (remarks of Sen. Pastore). \n \n30  The application of this principle to Title VI was addressed by four members of the Supreme Court in Bakke. Justice \n  Stevens (joined by Justices Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist) quoted with approval the Amicus brief submitted by the \ngovernment, in which the government argued: \n“(T)he grant of an injunction or a declaratory judgment in a private action would not be inconsistent with the \nadministrative program established by section 602. . . . A declaratory judgment or injunction against future \ndiscrimination would not raise the possibility that funds would be terminated, and it would not involve bringing the \nforces of the Executive Branch to bear on state programs; it therefore would not implicate the concern that led to \nthe limitations contained in Section 602.” \nSupplemental Brief at 30 n.25, Quoted in, Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 288 n. 26, 98 \nS.Ct. 2733, 2748, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978). \n \n31  See, e. g., Civil Rights Attorneys’ Fee Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. s 1988 (1976) (explicitly including actions under \n  Title VI); Section 718 of the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. s 1617 (1978) (explicitly including actions \nunder Title VI as they pertain to elementary and secondary education, where the legal proceeding is “necessary to \n12 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \nbring about compliance”). \n \n32  The Civil Rights Attorneys’ Fee Award Act of 1976 was enacted after several reported decisions (Lau v. Nichols, 414 \n  U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974); Bossier Parish School Board v. Lemon, 370 F.2d 847 (5th Cir.), Cert. \ndenied, 388 U.S. 911, 87 S.Ct. 2116, 18 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1967)) had held or assumed that Title VI provided a private \ncause of action. While the Attorneys’ Fee Act was not intended to create any new causes of action, it is unlikely that \nCongress would have explicitly included Title VI unless it approved such actions. \n \n33  The executive agencies have also adopted the position that Title VI creates a private cause of action. In the Amicus \n  brief in Bakke; in recent oral argument before the Supreme Court in Cannon v. University of Chicago, No. 77-926, \nJanuary 9, 1979, Reported in 47 U.S.L.W. 3471 (January 16, 1979); and in the HEW brief before this Court, the \nargument has been consistently advanced that Title VI provides a private cause of action for enforcement of \nstatutory rights. We attach importance to this position because it indicates that a private cause is consistent in \npractice with an administrative remedy, and, hence, with the legislative scheme. \n \n34  The Court stated: “We do not reach the Equal Protection Clause argument which has been advanced but Rely solely \n  on Section 601 . . . to reverse the Court of Appeals. 414 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. at 788. (emphasis added) \n \n35  The Supreme Court noted that: \n \nTitle IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Except for the substitution of the word “sex” in \nTitle IX to replace the words “race, color, or national origin” in Title VI, the two statutes use identical language to \ndescribe the benefited class. Both statutes provide the same administrative mechanism for terminating federal \nfinancial support for institutions engaged in prohibited discrimination. \n—- U.S. ——, 99 S.Ct. 1956 (footnotes omitted). \n \n36  “Neither statute expressly mentions a private remedy for the person excluded from participation in a federally \n  funded program. The drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed that it would be interpreted and applied as Title VI had \nbeen during the preceding eight years.” Id. (footnotes omitted). \n \n37  —- U.S. ——, 99 S.Ct. 1946. E. g. Bossier Parish School Board v. Lemon, 370 F.2d 847 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 388 U.S. \n  911, 87 S.Ct. 2116, 18 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1967). \n \n38  47 U.S.L.W. 4554. E. g., Allen v. Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 556, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969); Sullivan v. \n  Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 238, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969). \n13 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \n \n39  —- U.S. at ——, 99 S.Ct. 1946 n. 25, 26, 27. \n \n \n40  —- U.S. at ——, 99 S.Ct. 1946. \n \n \n41  —- U.S. at ——, 99 S.Ct. 1946. \n \n \n42  —- U.S. at ——, 99 S.Ct. 1946. \n \n \n43  “We have no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI \n  and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of the prohibited \ndiscrimination.” —- U.S. ——, 99 S.Ct. at 1961 (footnotes omitted). \n \n44  This is especially so because of the manner in which the respondents in Cannon cast their argument. Proceeding \n  from the premise that Title IX and Title VI should receive the same construction, they challenged the construction of \nTitle VI by which a private right of action is implied. While the Supreme Court noted that this argument did not \naddress the question of what Congress believed Title VI to mean, (which was the controlling issue), the Court went \non to discuss the respondent’s challenges on the merits. 47 U.S.L.W. at 4557. The Court concluded that the express \nprovision for private actions under Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not preclude the inference that \nsuch an action was intended under Title VI as well. Id. Further, the Court rejected the argument that comments of \nRepresentative  Gill,  and  Senators  Kuchel  and  Keating,  during  Congressional  debate,  indicated  an  explicit \nCongressional intent to deny a private right of action. Id. at 4558, 4559. Thus, the Supreme Court has rejected two \ncontentions which were central to WMC’s argument on appeal. \n \n45  Justice White, the sole Justice in Bakke to deny the existence of a private right of action, questioned the practical \n  effect of finding such a cause: \nIf private suits to enjoin conduct allegedly violative of s 601 were permitted, recipients of federal funds would be \npresented  with  the  choice  of  either  ending  what  the  court,  rather  than  the  agency,  determined  to  be  a \ndiscriminatory practice within the meaning of Title VI or refusing federal funds and thereby escaping from the \nstatute’s jurisdictional predicate. This is precisely the same choice which would confront recipients if suit was \nbrought to cut off funds. Both types of actions would equally jeopardize the administrative processes so carefully \nstructured into the law. \n46 U.S.L.W. at 4927 (footnote omitted). However, the administrative process provided in section 602 was not \nintended to insulate a federal funding recipient from making hard choices as to whether it would accept funding \ntermination as a cost of continuing to discriminate. Rather, the section 602 limit was intended to protect the \nrecipient from making such choices at the insistence of an unfettered federal grant making agency. If under the \nthreat of a private suit, a recipient were to decide to Decline federal money (or more likely to cease discriminatory \n14 \n \n\n \n \nNational Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Medical..., 599 F.2d 1247 (1979)   \n \n \npractices) the rights established by section 601 would be vindicated without the exercise of federal executive power, \nand the concern which prompted Congress to enact sections 602 and 603 would not arise. \n \n46  Section 504 provides: \n \nNo otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, as defined in section 706(6) of this title, shall, \nsolely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n \n47  As the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee noted, “Section 504 was patterned after, and is almost identical \n  to,  the  antidiscrimination  language  of  section  601  (of  Title  VI).  .  .  .  The  section  therefore  constitutes  the \nestablishment of a broad government policy that programs receiving Federal financial assistance shall be operated \nwithout discrimination on the basis of handicap.” S.Rep.No. 93-1297, 93 Cong., 2d Sess. 39-40, Reprinted in 4 \nU.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 6373, 6390 (1974). \n \n48  The  1974  Amendments  were  enacted  to  clarify  the  1973  Act,  and  should  be  accorded  great  weight  when \n  interpreting Congressional intent. See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FTC, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 \nL.Ed.2d 371 (1969). \nIt should be noted that the fact that Congress intentionally modelled Section 504 after Title VI and the fact that its \nhistory shows an explicit intent to include a private cause of action strengthens our conclusion that a private cause \nof action was contemplated as a natural part of Title VI as well. \n \n49  As noted in footnote 27, HEW cannot be a defendant in the suit on the private cause of action. To the extent that it \n  has been named as a defendant and treated as a defendant for the purposes of the private suit, the action against it \nshould be dismissed. HEW remains a party to the petition for judicial review, but that action will, under our \ndisposition (see fn. 10), be reserved pending the outcome of the trial on the merits on remand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n ",
