    "summary": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n<p>This case is part of the Clearinghouse's special collection on the Attica Uprising. In September of 1971, incarcerated people in New York's Attica Correctional Facility took control of the prison and took several staff members hostage. The uprising ended when state police violently stormed the prison, killing over 40 incarcerated people and staff members. Attica was one of the most significant events in the American prisoners' rights movement and drew public attention to poor conditions in prisons across the country. The uprising, retaking, and their aftermaths spawned numerous lawsuits, many of which are included in this special collection.</p>\r\n<p>This case concerns damages for the incarcerated people injured or killed during the retaking and reprisals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Complaint</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a class action concerning liability and damages for the violence committed against incarcerated people at Attica during the retaking and reprisals. The class included all incarcerated people who were in D-Yard during the retaking. The complaint was initially filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 13, 1974, but then was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, where Attica is located. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 11, 1975. The case was assigned to District Judge John Elfvin.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and &sect; 1985(3), alleging violations of the Due Process and Equal Protections Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiffs also alleged a conspiracy to violate these amendments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint included eleven causes of action, which the court broke down into three main categories. The first category was allegations concerning the plan to retake the prison, including the failure to plan for medical care (&ldquo;plan claims&rdquo;). The second was the reprisals after the retaking (&ldquo;reprisals claims&rdquo;), which included the failure to provide medical care to those injured. The third was the prosecution of people involved in the uprising (&ldquo;prosecution claims&rdquo;). The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages of more than $4 billion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants included Governor Nelson Rockefeller, the Commissioner of Corrections Russell Oswald, the Superintendent of Attica Vincent Mancusi, the Assistant Deputy Superintendent of Attica Karl Pfeil, and state police Major John Monahan, as well as other state prison and law enforcement officials. The defendants were sued in their individual capacity. The court denied the defendants&rsquo; early motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Phase: Class Certification</strong></p>\r\n<p>The court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for class certification on October 30, 1979. The class included &ldquo;all persons who were on September 13, 1971 inmates of the Attica Correctional Facility, Wyoming County, N.Y., and who were present in D-yard of Attica on such date.&rdquo; Approximately 1,281 people were part of the class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 1979, the court narrowed the prosecution claim. In the same order, the court dismissed Mancusi and Pfeil from the plan claims and Pfeil from the prosecution claim.</p>\r\n<p>Leading up to April 1980, the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel, Bob Cantor, a Manhattan criminal defense attorney, sought to withdraw from the case because he felt he was unable to adequately represent the class. According to Heather Ann Thompson, this was because of the magnitude of the case and the fact that he was working from Manhattan. <em>Blood in the Water</em>, 462. On April 21, 1980, the court ordered the parties to begin discovery, but the plaintiffs failed to do so. 88 F.R.D. 244.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By October 1980, the plaintiffs had still not started discovery. So, on October 27, 1980, the court said the case would be dismissed for failure to prosecute unless the plaintiffs began discovery within 120 days. In the same order, the court concluded Cantor was unable to adequately represent the class because he failed to begin discovery, so he was allowed to withdraw. 88 F.R.D. 244. Since the plaintiffs no longer had counsel, the court revoked the class certification order without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to recertify the class once they had adequate representation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, the plaintiffs obtained new counsel, Elizabeth Fink, who was part of the Attica Brothers Legal Defense efforts. The Attica Brothers Legal Defense were the attorneys who represented incarcerated people at Attica charged with crimes committed during the uprising. Later, attorneys Michael Deutsch, Joe Heath, Danny Meyers, and Dennis Cunningham, who also had prior experience with Attica litigation, joined the plaintiffs&rsquo; team. With new counsel, the plaintiffs began discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs waited to recertify the class until they had the evidence they wanted from discovery, which took several years. After various subpoenas and attempts by defendants to get protective orders to avoid having to answer requests to admit, 91 F.R.D. 590, the plaintiffs completed their discovery. Fink was even able to read the Meyer Report (referenced in <a href=\"../../../../case/13661/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matter of Carey</a>) because the records clerk in the office accidentally allowed her to view it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once the plaintiffs had their complete discovery materials, they moved to recertify the class. The court granted the motion for recertification on June 24, 1985. The class remained the same: those in D-yard during the retaking. In response, the defendants moved to decertify the class, which the court denied on April 3, 1987. 1987 WL 8948. In the same opinion, the court denied the defendants&rsquo; request to dismiss the reprisals and prosecution claims, finding that the previous litigation concerning an injunction to stop reprisals and to require officials to prosecute state police (<a href=\"../../../../case/15208/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inmates of Attica v. Rockefeller</a>), did not collaterally estop the claims. 1987 WL 8948.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Phase: Pretrial Motions</strong></p>\r\n<p>After April 3, 1987, all defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On September 28, 1988, the court granted the governor&rsquo;s estate&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment. 1988 WL 103346. The court found that because the governor was not present at the retaking, he did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment or violate due process, and there was insufficient evidence he engaged in a conspiracy to do so. The court found the governor was also entitled to qualified immunity because ordering the retaking did not violate clearly established law.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the decision. On December 15, 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 885 F.2d 1060. The panel included Circuit Judges Jon Newman and Roger Miner and District Judge Robert Ward. Circuit Judge Miner wrote the opinion. The court agreed the governor&rsquo;s involvement in the retaking was insufficient to establish liability under &sect; 1983, that there was no basis for supervisor liability, and that the governor was entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, the governor&rsquo;s estate was dismissed from the case.</p>\r\n<p>On June 26, 1990, the court denied Oswald, Mancusi, and Pfeil&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, finding they were not entitled to qualified immunity. However, the court did dismiss Mancusi and Oswald from the prosecution claim because of insufficient evidence. 1990 WL 97729.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oswald, Mancusi, and Pfeil appealed. On February 17, 1991, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 926 F.2d 235. The panel included Circuit Judges Jon Newman, Irving Kaufman, and Joseph McLaughlin. Circuit Judge Newman wrote the opinion. The court held the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity except for the plan claims pertaining to medical care and the reprisals claim. The court found there was sufficient evidence to show the defendants knew about the reprisals even though they did not participate in them. The Supreme Court denied the defendants&rsquo; petition for certiorari on October 7, 1991.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendant Monahan&rsquo;s estate also moved for dismissal based on qualified immunity. The court dismissed Monahan from the prosecution claim, but otherwise denied the motion. 1990 WL 130555.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Trial &amp; Aftermath</strong></p>\r\n<p>Prior to trial, the court decided to bifurcate the case into two phases: one for liability and one for damages. After the court resolved the defendants&rsquo; pretrial motions, the remaining claims for the liability trial were: 1) the plan claim against Commissioner of Corrections Oswald for failure to plan for medical treatment after the retaking, 2) the plan claim against Major Monahan for supervising the state police during the retaking and failing to provide medical care, and 3) the reprisals claims against Oswald, Superintendent Mancusi, and Assistant Deputy Superintendent Pfeil for failing to stop the reprisals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties took those claims to trial in 1991. The trial ran from late 1991 until January 9, 1992. The jury was instructed to determine 1) whether reprisals had occurred and 2) which defendants caused the reprisals. The jury issued its verdict February 4, 1992, finding there had been reprisals and an unconstitutional failure to provide medical care after the retaking. The jury could not reach unanimous verdicts for the reprisals claim against Oswald or Mancusi or the plan claims against Monahan and Oswald, meaning a retrial would be needed to establish liability.</p>\r\n<p>However, the jury did return a verdict against Pfeil, finding he was liable for the reprisals because he condoned them. The verdict sheet asked the jury, if they found there were reprisals, did the plaintiffs prove that Pfeil was &ldquo;liable to the plaintiffs or any of them for any injury&hellip;resulting from such reprisals.&rdquo; Prior to trial, Oswald and Pfeil&rsquo;s counsel had objected to this language in the verdict sheet, arguing the language &ldquo;plaintiffs or any of them&rdquo; was insufficient to establish class-wide liability. They would later raise the same challenge on appeal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After the jury returned its verdict, all defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law. The court denied Pfeil&rsquo;s motion on January 16, 1993, finding there was no error in jury instructions, the verdicts were not based on evidence outside the record, and that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find Pfeil liable. 1993 WL 22829. The court similarly denied Mancusi and Oswald&rsquo;s motions on January 19, 1993, and Monahan&rsquo;s motion on February 22, 1993. 1993 WL 22818.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Damages Phase: Pre-Trial Negotiations</strong></p>\r\n<p>After post-trial litigation was complete, the parties moved on to resolving damages against Pfeil, as he was the only defendant found liable. According to Thompson, Fink wanted to pursue settlement negotiations, so she contacted Judge Elfvin&rsquo;s boss, Chief Judge Michael Telesca, to broker the settlement. Telesca suggested Magistrate Judge Edmund Maxwell, who oversaw the liability trial, handle the negotiations. <em>Blood in the Water</em>, 483. On April 8, 1992, the court transferred the case to Maxwell to handle settlement negotiations. However, negotiations broke down and ended in November 1992.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, the parties had to proceed with the damages phase of trial against Pfeil. The plaintiffs only pursued damages against Pfeil because he was the only defendant found liable, which was sufficient for the plaintiffs to obtain damages. Also, the state would be paying the damages regardless. In January 1993, the court encouraged the plaintiffs to &ldquo;focus on their claims against Pfeil in order to facilitate the fashioning of an appealable final judgment.&rdquo; 186 F.3d 252. For the next year and a half, the parties considered various subclasses and selected &ldquo;typical&rdquo; plaintiffs to try to expedite determining damage amounts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In August 1994, the court scheduled the liability trials. However, the defendants refused to stipulate that Pfeil was liable for the entire class given the language in the verdict sheet saying &ldquo;plaintiffs or any of them.&rdquo; So, the damage trials were postponed. On November 17, 1994, the court advised Pfeil that an interlocutory appeal was the appropriate method to resolve the question of class-wide liability, but Pfeil wanted to wait until the damage trials to appeal so he could argue he was not liable at the damage trial. So, the plaintiffs tried to secure a ruling on class-wide liability they could appeal. However, the court refused to grant that ruling on May 2, 1995. The same day, the court proposed to decertify the class and hold individual trials for each plaintiff. According to Thompson, this was because Elfvin was tired of the plaintiffs pressuring him to quickly resolve damages, so he instead threatened to make them hold separate trials. <em>Blood in the Water</em>, 480.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the court&rsquo;s effort to decertify the class, the plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus from the Second Circuit. The writ was denied without prejudice on June 30, 1995 as long as the court immediately scheduled the damage trials. In response, Elfvin rescheduled the trials. However, Elfvin said he would allow Pfeil to challenge his liability for individual plaintiffs at the damage trials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, on June 6, 1995, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend their complaint to secure liability against Mancusi and Monahan based on what they argued was proved at trial. The court reasoned that neither claim was specifically tried and that amendment would prejudice Mancusi and Monahan. 1995 WL 353159. So, the damages trial continued only against Pfeil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on Elfvin&rsquo;s statement that Pfeil would be allowed to challenge his liability at the damages trial, the plaintiffs moved the Second Circuit to reconsider the writ of mandamus. The plaintiffs were concerned that Pfeil would have another chance to argue he was not liable, which would violate the Seventh Amendment by letting the damage jury reconsider the liability jury's finding. Before the Second Circuit could rule on that, Elfvin changed his position. Elfvin stated that prima facie, the trial verdict &ldquo;must be construed as imposing an all-encompassing responsibility upon Pfeil but allowing him to tender, but not necessarily to adduce, evidence that some particular hurt or deprivation from reprisals was so &lsquo;out-of-the-mainstream&rsquo; ... as to be beyond Pfeil's responsibility.&rdquo; On November 16, 1995, the Second Circuit denied the motion for reconsideration of the mandamus petition. Pfeil later challenged the liability finding in his appeal after the damage trials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court then moved forward with the damages trials. The parties selected two plaintiffs who would be representative of the high-end and low-end of damages. The high-end damages trial included the plaintiff Smith, who was one of the leaders of the uprising and one of the most severely injured. The second plaintiff was selected because his injuries were typical of most class-members. In both trials, the jury was instructed to accept as true that reprisals had occurred and that Pfeil was liable for the injuries caused by the reprisals. However, the jury was told they must determine what specific acts counted as reprisals in assessing damages for the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s trial was held from May 29 to June 4, 1997. The jury awarded $4 million in monetary damages. The second trial was held from June 23 to June 26, 1997. The jury awarded $75,000 in monetary damages. The court denied Pfeil&rsquo;s motion to set aside both verdicts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Phase: Post-Trial Motions and Appeals</strong></p>\r\n<p>After both verdicts, Pfeil moved for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial, which the court denied on October 2, 1997. 1997 WL 613232. The court found the jury instructions were proper, that Pfeil was liable for his &ldquo;knowing and wanton failure to protect inmates&rdquo; from reprisals, that any erroneously admitted evidence was harmless error, and that the awards were not too large. The court then granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motions for entry of partial final judgments on November 4, 1997. 1997 WL 736690. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pfeil then appealed the judgments against him, both the damage determinations and the liability finding. On August 3, 1999, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. 186 F.3d 252. The panel included Chief Judge Ralph Winter, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler, and District Judge Peter Dorcey. Chief Judge Winter wrote the opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court held the jury instructions in the liability trial were permissible because they correctly stated that Pfeil could be held liable for being deliberately indifferent to the reprisals. However, the court found the liability verdict did not establish class-wide liability based on the quoted language above. On its face, the verdict sheet did not require findings sufficient to establish class-wide liability. Accordingly, the court reversed the damage awards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next, the court found the bifurcated trial violated the Seventh Amendment because it enabled the damage juries to reexamine issues decided by the liability jury, namely what specific acts counted as reprisals. Finally, the court ordered the district court to reconsider if the case should be a class action since retrial seemed inevitable. The court said common issues of law and fact did not appear to predominate over individual ones.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Final Settlement Discussions and Distribution of Funds</strong></p>\r\n<p>After the Second Circuit&rsquo;s reversal, the parties entered into settlement discussions with the help of Judge Telesca. The parties submitted a proposed settlement agreement on January 4, 2000 in which the state agreed to put $8 million in a damages fund to be apportioned by the court. However, the state did not admit liability. The state also agreed to put $4 million in a fund for attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Telesca then took over the case. On February 14, 2000, the court held a fairness hearing for class members to share their opinions on the settlement offer. The court issued a preliminary approval of the settlement agreement on February 15, 2000. Class members were ordered to submit claim forms to participate in the settlement. The court received 581 claims. 200 class members testified about their claims from May to August 2000. Ultimately, the court found there were 502 valid claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court issued a final approval and plan for distribution of the settlement on August 28, 2000. 113 F.Supp.2d 441. The court held that the settlement was fair and equitable. In dividing up the settlement, the court created five categories of class members, ranging from those who were moderately injured, to those who were killed. The court established a sliding scale for damages from $6,500 to $125,000. The appendix of the opinion included a summary of all the claims and the violence endured.</p>\r\n<p>The court then dismissed the case with prejudice and ordered the clerk to direct the distribution of the funds once the time for appeal of the decision expired. Some class members attempted to appeal, but such appeals were withdrawn with prejudice on December 19, 2000. The case is now closed.</p>",

See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra; \nMitchell  v.

In Mitchell, the defendant was no longer Attorney General at \nthe time the Complaint was filed.) Therefore, it is irrelevant that the late Governor can no longer be subjected to \nsuch interferences as discovery and trial; his estate is thus entitled to such defense if it is established as a matter of \nlaw. \n \n \n \n7 \n \n\n \n \nAl-Jundi v.

Judgment respecting Pfeil’s liability for \nthese reprisals must also await trial.   \n  \nFinally as to the third section of the Amended Complaint, \nFootnotes \n \n1  Plaintiffs Durham, Lundy, Hicks, McNeil, Santos and Barkley have been dismissed for lack of standing. Memorandum \n  and Order, dated October 30, 1979, at p. 21. Plaintiff Barnes has recently been added by consolidation of a related \nsuit. See Barnes v. State of New York, CIV–73–442E (W.D.N.Y. January 8, 1990). He had sued certain defendants \nwhich are not parties to this action—viz., The State of New York, Paul D. McGinnis and The State Corrections \nCommittee. The claims against these defendants are deemed to have been abandoned. Concerning the status of the \nvarious captioned defendants herein, see fn. 6 hereinbelow. \n \n2  Both this Court’s decision and the appellate decision affirming such contain detailed background discussions. \n \n \n3  Eleven hostages were rescued, one of whom later died of inmate-inflicted wounds. \n \n \n4  The Amended Complaint is labelled by the plaintiffs simply “COMPLAINT–CLASS ACTION,” but was their second \n  pleading herein, filed of right, and has been construed and regarded by this Court as their Amended Complaint. See \nMemorandum and Order, dated October 30, 1979, at p. 2 fn. 2 & p. 4 fn. 3. \n \n5  So far as can be ascertained, all counts relate to all defendants, although certain counts identify certain defendants \n5 \n \n\n \n \nAl-Jundi v. Estate of Rockefeller, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1990)   \n \n \n  by name as being among others. Several counts reference identical constitutional and/or statutory provisions, and \nthe first count, aside from its substantive claim or claims, makes jurisdictional allegations, and identifies the parties \nand “facts” common to all counts. Finally the lattermost counts are largely one-sentence reallegations-by-reference \nof earlier paragraphs labelled with different asserted causes of action. \n \n6  As for the other defendants, the estate of the late Governor Rockefeller had been substituted in his stead upon his \n  death in 1979, and the estate was eventually dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity and the Governor’s lack \nof personal involvement in the events. Al–Jundi v. Estate of Rockefeller, supra. Dunbar was dismissed for the \nplaintiff’s failure to substitute his estate following his death in 1975. Memorandum and Order, dated October 30, \n1979, at pp. 7–8. Van Eekeren, Miller, Vincent, Hurd, Carney, Williams, Moochler, Malovich, Quick, Shurter, Gellert, \nElbet, Kruk, Dillon, Halloran, Crouse, Dwyer, Zelinski, Toray, Connell, Muthig, Parr, Patterson, McCarthy, Ellis and \nByre were all dismissed for lack of service upon them of the Amended Complaint. Id., at pp. 7, 14. New York Deputy \nAttorney General Fischer was dismissed on the basis of prosecutorial immunity. Id., at pp. 28–29 and Order, dated \nApril 23, 1980. Baker was dismissed without opposition. Order, dated October 20, 1980. O’Hara was dismissed for \nlack of allegations of personal involvement. Memorandum and Order, dated October 30, 1979, at p. 40. And the \ndefendants Doe were all dismissed for the plaintiff’s failure to substitute named defendants within a reasonable \nperiod of time. Id., at p. 15. Aside from the three movants, the only remaining defendant is the late John Monahan, \nwhose estate might or might not be substituted depending on this Court’s resolution of a pending motion. See \nMemorandum and Order, dated June 14, 1990. \n \n7  As an off-shoot of their qualified immunity defenses, each also contends that an action asserting a deprivation of \n  constitutional rights brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cannot lie against them, inasmuch as state officials acting in \ntheir official capacities are not “persons” who may be sued within the contemplation of section 1983. See Will v. \nMichigan Dept. of State Police (“Will”), 490 U.S. ––––, 109 S.Ct. 2304 (1989). This contention, however, is nothing \nmore than a warmed-over version of an Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity defense under a slightly variant \ntheory. And these defendants have already been dismissed from this suit in their official capacities. Memorandum \nand Order, dated October 30, 1979, at pp. 15–16. Nothing in Will or the Eleventh Amendment precludes a section \n1983 suit against state officials in their individual capacities, which is precisely the footing upon which this suit \nagainst these defendants presently stands. \n \n8  These defendants have alternatively requested in limine respecting whether they had acted in their official or \n  individual capacities in their alleged actions. Such requests are frivolous and rest upon a miscomprehension of \nimmunity law. See footnote 7 hereinabove. They are likewise denied. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n6 \n ",

They brought  this action seeking damages \nfor  civil  rights violations,  claiming  that  they  were  injured \nby  law  enforcement  officers  during  and  after  the  retaking  of \nAttica  on  September  13,  1971,  which  ended  a  four-day  riot. \nThe  case  was  commenced  on  September  12,  1974  and  has  a  long, \ncomplex  procedural  history,  including  several  trials  and \nappeals.  On August  12,  1999,  the case was  re-assigned to this \nCourt  for  expedited treatment pursuant  to the  decision of  the \nSecond  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  dated  August  3,  1999. \nFollowing  intensive  negotiations,  the  part~es  presented  a \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 4 of 76\nproposed  Settlement  Agreement  dated  January  4,  2000  which \nprovided  for  the  State  of  New  York  (without  admitting \nliability)  to pay  $8,000,000.00  into a  fund  to be apportioned \nby the Court among the qualified plaintiff class members.  The \nterms  of  the  settlement  require  the  Court  to  determine  the \nindividual  awards  in  proportion  to  the  seriousness  of  the \ninjuries  sustained  by  all  class  members  making  claims.  The \nSettlement  Agreement  also  provides  that  a  separate  fund  be \nestablished  in  the  amount  of  $4,000,000.00  by  the  State  for \ndisbursement to plaintiffs'  class attorneys for legal services \nrendered  during  the past  25  years  in addition  to  those \nrendered in these proceedings.  Allocation of those funds  will \nbe  dealt  with  in a  separate  decision. \nThe  intent of the settlement  is to limit recovery to only \nclass  members  who  were  defined  in  a  1979  Decision  as  those \nAttica  inmates who  were  in D-Yard  on September 13,  1971.  The \nsettlement  is  specific  in  this  regard  and,  therefore,  cannot \ncover  injuries  sustained by inmates who  are  not  class members \neven though  they may have  been  injured elsewhere  at Attica on \nor  after  September  13,  1971.  Nor,  unfortunately,  can  the \nsettlement  benefit  the  families  of  the  deceased  or  injured \n-Page  2-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 5 of 76\nhostages.  A significant benefit of the settlement process was \nto  afford  the  class  members  the  opportunity  to  testify \npublicly  and  to  bring  this  case  to  a  conclusion  without \nestablishing fault or responsibility.  Finality and resolution \nare  thus  achieved  to  the  extent  possible  under  the \ncircumstances  presented to  this  Court . \nA  fairness  hearing  was  held  on  February  14,  2000  which \ngave class members  the opportunity to express their views with \nrespect  to the proposed settlement.  This  Court  then issued a \nDecision  and  Order  dated  February  15,  2000  granting \npreliminary approval  of  the proposed settlement and directing \nthat  notice  of  the  settlement  terms  be  provided  to  class \nmembers  by  regular  mail  and  by  publication.  Class  members \nwere  required  to  file  sworn  claim  forms  by  no  later  than \nJuly 7,  2000  in order to participate in the settlement.  Class \nmembers  were  also  informed  that  each  would  be  given  the \nopportunity to supplement his claim with in-court testimony if \nhe  so  desired.  Class  members  choosing  not  to  testify would \nhave  their  claims  fully  considered on  the  basis  of  the  sworn \nclaim  form  along with any documentary proof  in support  of  the \nclaim. \n-Page  3-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 6 of 76\nPROCEDURE  FOR  EVALUATING  CLAIMS \nThe  settlement  requires  the  Court  to  make  a \nproportionate,  equitable distribution of  the  settlement  fund \namong  the  qualified  class  members.  A  procedure  was \nestablished for  each class member  to make  a  claim and for  the \nCourt  to evaluate the claim and determine its value based upon \nthe  comparative  seriousness  of  the  injuries  sustained.  All \nclaims,  including  the  death  claims,  shall  be  paid  from  the \nsettlement fund which was  initially established in the amount \nof  $8,000,000  paid  into  the  Registry  of  the  Court  subject  to \nthe  Court's  control. \nVerification of  Class  Membership \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that only class members \nare entitled to share in the proceeds  of  the  settlement  fund. \nThe plaintiffs'  class is defined in a  Decision and Order dated \nOctober  31,  1979,  as  ''all  persons  who  were  on  September  13, \n1971  inmates  of  the  Attica  Correctional  Facility,  Wyoming \nCounty,  N.Y.,  and who  were present in D-yard of Attica on such \ndate.\"  Following  the  announcement  of  the  settlement  on \nFebruary  14,  2000,  this  Court  received  581  claims  from \nindividuals  claiming  to be  class members.  It was  critical to \n-Page  4-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 7 of 76\nfirst  verify  the  claimant's  membership  in  the  plaintiffs' \nclass.  The  Court  reviewed Attica prison records  listing the \nname  of  every  inmate  incarcerated at Attica on  September  13, \n1971 and separately identifying those inmates who were present \nin D-Yard on  that  date.  The  Court  also examined  the  inmate's \nindividual  prison  files  produced  by  the  New  York  State \nDepartment  of  Corrections  during  the  discovery phase  of  this \nlitigation to search for any documentary evidence which could \nconfirm whether or not  he was  at Attica and present  in D-Yard \non  September  13,  1971.  If  no  documents  were  found,  then  a \nseparate notice was  sent by  the  Court  to that  claimant  or his \nrepresentative  providing  him  with  an  opportunity  within  one \nmonth  to supplement  his claim with any evidence to refute the \npresumption  that  the  claimant  was  not  present  in  D-Yard  on \nSeptember  13,  1971. \nThose  persons  whose  claims  were  disallowed  or  withdrawn \nare  listed  in Appendix  III  and  are  not  entitled  to  share  in \nthe  settlement  proceeds. \nThe  Claim  Process \nA claim form was made available to each claimant  together \nwith instructions for completing and filing the claim with the \n-Page  5-\n' \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 8 of 76\nCourt by no  later than July 7,  2000.  A small number of claims \nwere  accepted after the July 7,  2000  deadline  from  claimants \nwho  p~ovided a  reasonable  explanation  for  not  filing  sooner. \nEach  claimant  was  to  verify  that  he  was  an  inmate  in  the \nAttica  Correctional  Facility in D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971 \nand  was  injured  as  a  result  of  the  retaking.  Each  was \nrequired  to  describe  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  injuries \nsustained  together  with  any  supporting  medical  information \nwhich  might  be  helpful  to  the  Court.  Once  the  claim  was \nfiled,  each was afforded the opportunity to testify in support \nof  his  claim  in  open  court.  However,  many  chose  not  to \ntestify but instead relied upon their verified claims together \nwith any additional  supporting material.  Appearance  in Court \nwas  not  mandatory  to  prove  the  value  of  a  claim.  Those  who \nchose  to testify gained no  financial advantage over those who \nchose  not  to  testify. \nApproximately 200  plaintiffs chose to testify in support \nof  their  claims  during  the  period  May  through  August,  2000. \nApproximately 160 appeared in person and gave  their testimony \nat  the  Federal  Courthouse  in  Rochester,  New  York.  Many \ntraveled  at  their  own  expense  from  various  locations  in \n-Page  6-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 9 of 76\nNew  York,  and  from  New  Jersey,  South  Carolina,  Ohio, \nPennsylvania,  Florida,  and Minnesota.  With the cooperation of \nthe New York State Department of Corrections,  those plaintiffs \nwho  are  currently  incarcerated  in  various  New  York  prisons \nwere  able  to  give  their  testimony  by  telephone  or  video \nconference  from  the  prison  where  they  are  located.  The \nremaining  incarcerated  plaintiffs  were  transported  by  the \nNew  York  State  Department  of  Corrections  and,  with  the \ncooperation  of  the  U. S.  Marshal  and  the  Immigration  and \nNaturalization  Service,  Court  was  convened  at  the  Federal \nDetention Facility in Batavia,  New  York  on August  2,  2000  and \ntheir testimony was  taken. \nThe  Evaluation Process \nA  distribution  formula  was  adopted  which  equitably \ndistributes  the  settlement  proceeds  among  the  qualified \nclaimants.  Each claim was  evaluated and placed in one of five \ncategories based upon the relative seriousness of the injuries \nsustained.  Those  categories  represent  groups  of  injured \ninmates  ranging  from  those  who  were  least  injured  in \nCategory  I  to  the  death  claims  in  Category V.  The  following \ncategories  were  established based upon  a  discernible  cluster \n-Page  7-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 10 of 76\nof  inmates  having  suffered  a  similar  degree  of  injuries  in \neach category.  This  determination was  made  after hearing all \nclaims and evaluating all injuries sustained by each claimant . \nSome  overlap  was  inevitable  because  the  process  was  not \nscientific and a  mathematical certainty could not be achieved. \nCategory :r  Inmates  in  this  category  were  beaten,  ran  the \ngauntlet,  received physical  injuries,  suffered \nemotional  distress,  nightmares,  etc. ,  or \nexperienced  any  combination  of  these \noccurrences. \nCategory :r:r  Inmates  in  this  category  received beatings \nwhich  resulted  in  broken  bones,  including \nbroken fingers,  broken ribs,  loss of  teeth,  and \ncontinue  to suffer from  emotional  distress. \nCategory :r:r:r  Inmates  in  this  category  received gunshot \nwounds  and/or  were  singled  out  for  special \ntreatment  such  as  being  subjected  to  more \nsevere,  repeated  beatings  which  resulted  in  a \npermanent  disability  and  continuing  emotional \ndistress. \n-Page  8-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 11 of 76\nCategory  IV  Inmates  in this  category received very  severe, \nmultiple  beatings,  were  subjected  to  acts  of \ntorture,  or  were  severely  wounded  by  gunfire. \nThe  injuries were life-threatening and resulted \n1n  serious  permanent  disability,  either \nphysical  or  emotional. \nCategory V  Inmates  in  this  category  died  as  a  result  of \ngunshot  wounds  received during  the  retaking. \nI  found  the  claimants,  for  the most  part,  to be  credible \nand  some  understated  the  extent  of  their  injuries  and  how \nthose  injuries  affected  their  lives.  Many  gave  testimony \nunder  obvious  emotional  strain  finding  it  difficult  to \nrecount  the  events  after  suppressing  memories  for  29  years. \nAnd,  many  remain  casualties  because  of  lingering  physical \nproblems  and  the  inability to  erase memories  of Attica. \nGenerally  their  testimony,  as  to  the  extent  of  their \ninjuries and the treatment they received on September 13, 1971, \nwas  consi stent  with  information  contained  in  \"The  Official \nReport  of  the  New  York  State  Special  Commission  on  Attica,\" \n-Page  9-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 12 of 76\n(The McKay Commission)  and with testimony in a  number of Court \nof  Claims  trials arising out  of  the Attica uprising. \nA  number  of  the  plaintiffs  testified  that  their  sole \nsource  of  income  is  provided  by  public  assistance.  Indeed, \nmany are destitute.  The  awards  the Court  makes  today are not \nintended to be a  substitute for public assistance  for  day-to-\nday  costs  of  living but  rather  to  supplement  such  assistance \nto enhance  the  lives  of  the plaintiffs.  Indeed,  the majority \nof  the  awards  contemplated are  of  a  modest  sum  and  not  large \nenough to be a  substitute for other assistance received by the \nformer  inmate  plaintiffs. \nDISPOSITION  OF  CLAIMS \nTOTAL  CLAIMS  FILED:  581 \n.DUPLICATE  CLAIMS  FILED  - 38 \nDISALLOWED  OR  WITHDRAWN  CLAIMS  - 41 \nTOTAL  VALID  CLAIMS  502 \nBREAKDOWN  BY  CATEGORY  AMOUNT  PER  CLAIM \nCATEGORY  I:  260  $  6,500.00 \nCATEGORY  II:  112  $  10,000 . 00 \nCATEGORY  III:  95  $  31,000.00 \nCATEGORY  IV:  15  $125,000.00 \nCATEGORY  V:  20  $  25,000 . 00 \nSUBTOTAL  502 \nTOTAL  ALLOWABLE  CLAIMS  502 \n-Page  10-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 13 of 76\nHaving  examined  all  claims,  I  determine  that  the  amount \nawarded  to  each  of  the  claimants  is  fair  and  equitable  given \nthe  circumstances  presented  and  the  limited  funds  available \nfor  distribution. \nDEATH  CLAIMS \nAlthough  29  inmates  died  as  a  result  of  gunshot  wounds \ninflicted by  the  authorities  during  and  after  the  retaking, \nonly  2 0  claims  were  made  on  their  behalf  by  their  legal \nrepresentatives.  Their  claims  are  placed  in  a  separate \ncategory  and  are  listed in Appendix  II. \nIn determining  the value  to be  apportioned to  each death \nclaim,  the  Court  is  limited  to  considering only the  deceased \ninmate's  conscious  pain  and  suffering  as  the  measure  of \ndamage.  As  provided in the New  York Estates Powers  and Trusts \nLaw,  §  11-3.3, \n[w] here  an  injury  causes  the  death  of  a \nperson  the  damages  recoverable  for  such \ninjury are limited to those accruing before \ndeath and shall not  include damages  for  or \nby  reason  of  death,  except  that  the \nreasonable  funeral  expenses  of  the \ndecedent,  paid  by  the  estate  or  for  the \npayment of which the estate is responsible, \nshall  be  recoverable  in  such  action.  The \n-Page  11-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 14 of 76\ndamages recovered become part of the estate \nof  the  deceased.  (Emphasis  added.) \nThe  plaintiffs  initially  sought  recovery  for  injuries \nresulting  from  a  variety  of  civil  rights  violations  under \n42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  No  claim was  made  either  in  the  complaint \nor  amended  complaint  for  wrongful  death  of  those  killed. \nTherefore,  in  determining  the  amount  to  be  awarded  to  the \nestates  of  those  inmates  who  died  from  injuries  received \nduring the retaking,  the Court is limited to considerations of \nthe extent of claimant's conscious pain and suffering prior to \ndying.  Factors  such as  the  inmate's  future  earning capacity, \nlife  expectancy  age  and  health,  which  would  normally  be \nI  I \nconsidered  in a  wrongful  death  action  under  New  York  law \n~n \ndetermining  damages,  are  not  relevant  in this  instance.  Put \nsimply,  these  are not  wrongful  death  cases  because  they were \nnot  alleged as  such  in  the  complaint.  These  are  cases  where \nthe severity of  the plaintiffs'  injuries caused death and  the \nmeasure  of  damage  is  the  extent  of  the  conscious  pain  and \nsuffering  endured.  With  only  sparse  records  available \n-Page  12-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 15 of 76\n29  years  after  the  event,  the  task of  determining  the  extent \nof  conscious  pain  and  suffering was  difficult. \nThe  testimony  of  surviving  inmates  who  witnessed  the \nshooting  of  some  of  the  inmates  indicated  that  they  either \ndied quickly or lingered at most  for hours. 1  Most  died in the \nprison  infirmary  or  while  lying  in  D-Yard.  All  died  on \nSeptember 13,  1971 with the exception of William McKinney who \ndied  on  September  15,  1971  at  Meyer  Memorial  Hospital  in \nBuffalo,  New  York. \nBecause the settlement fund consists of a  fixed sum which \n~s to be distributed among both injured inmates who  lived and \nthose  who  died  from  injuries  received on  September  13,  1971, \nconsiderations  of  proportionality are  imperative.  There  are \nonly  so  many  dollars  to  be  apportioned  among  those  who  were \ninjured  and  those  who  died  as  a  result  of  the  injuries \nreceived during the retaking.  Under ideal circumstances with \nunlimited  resources  for  compensation,  many  of  the  inmates \n1The  testimony  of  John  Kabel,  an  Emergency  Medical \nTechnician  present  in  D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971, \ncorroborates  this  view.  His  sworn  affidavit  appears  in \nAppendix  IV  - \\\\Corroborating  Testimony.\" \n-Page  13-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 16 of 76\n(those killed and those who  survived with extensive injuries) \nmight  be  entitled to larger awards. \nAfter  weighing  all  these  factors,  I  determine  that  each \ndeath  claim  shall  be  awarded  $25,000  which  is  to  be  paid  to \nthe  legal  representative  of  the  deceased  inmate's  estate.  I \nalso  determine  that  a  $2,000  enhancement  for  the  two \nadditional  days  of  conscious  pain  and  suffering sustained by \nWilliam  McKinney  is  appropriate  for  a  total  award  to  his \nestate of  $27,000. \nAlthough the amount  awarded to inmates  who were killed is \nless  than  the  amount  awarded  to  those  inmates  who  were \nseverely  injured  and  tortured  or  who  survived  their  gunshot \nwounds,  it reflects  the  limited  period  of  time  the  deceased \ninmates experienced conscious pain and suffering in comparison \nto those inmates who  have  suffered with their injuries for the \npast  29  years  - injuries,  in  many  cases,  which  have  been \nseverely  disabling or extremely painful.  This  determination \nin  no  way  discounts  or  minimizes  the  severity  of  the  pain \nsuffered  by  those  inmates  who  died  as  a  result  of  their \ninjuries,  but  instead attempts  to  fairly apportion a  limited \n-Page  14-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 17 of 76\nsettlement  fund  among  class  members  who  received  a  wide \nvariety of  injuries. \nI  feel the apportionment of the settlement fund among  the \nliving  and  the  dead  is  fair.  Not  perfect  - but  fair. \nA  list of  each death claim and  the  amount  awarded  to  the \nrespective  legal  representative,  together  with a  synopsis  of \neach  claim,  appears  in Appendix  II. \nTESTIMONY \nOn  May  24,  2000,  this  Court  began  hearing  testimony  of \nthe  individual  plaintiffs  which,  for  many,  was  a  highly \nemotional  experience.  They  expressed  gratitude  for  the \nopportunity  to  finally  tell  their  stories.  For  many,  the \nprivilege  of  recounting  their  odyssey  was  of  greater  value \nthan  achieving  compensation.  And  for  some,  time  had  run  out \nand  their stories  were  told by  surviving  family  members. \nThe  recurring  theme  was  that  they  found  themselves  in \nD-Yard  on  September  9,  1971  (the  start of  the riot)  simply by \nbeing  in the wrong  place at  the wrong  time.  Each had his  own \nstory of  how  he  got  there. \n-Page  15-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 18 of 76\nAt  first,  realizing  that  they  were  not  under  the \nimmediate  control  of  the  guards,  a  carnival-like  atmosphere \nprevailed.  But,  they knew  that  this new  found  freedom  would \nnot last.  Each of the inmates was  helpless to end the impasse \nand  some  described  it  as  being  in  \"no  man's  land.\"  They \nwaited  for  something  to  happen  - they  all  knew  it would  not \nend peacefully. \nIt  rained  heavily  the  night  before  the  retaking.  They \nknew  that  Corrections  Officer  Quinn  had  died  and  that \nnegotiations  had  ended.  They  prepared  themselves  for  the \nworst  and,  on  September  13th,  they were  not  disappointed. \nThey  testified  about  hearing  the  whirring  noise  of  the \nhelicopter  that  hovered over D-Yard  in the misty,  gray  early \nmorning  hours  of  September  13,  1971  and  seeing  the  clouds  of \ngas  it  delivered  to  immobilize  the  inmates.  They  heard \nannouncements  over a  bullhorn to  \"raise your  hands  above  your \nhead and  go  to the nearest  officer and you  will  not be  hurt.\" \nUnfortunately,  that  was  not  the  case.  Gunfire  started \nsimultaneously  which  \"sounded  like  it  came  from  automatic \n-Page  16-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 19 of 76\nweapons . \"2  At  first ,  they thought  the gunfire was  with rubber \nbullets  - merely  to  stun them or frighten them.  But,  as  they \nsaw inmates around them being shot,  they knew  that it was  \"for \nreal.\"  Bullets  were  everywhere,  chipping  concrete  from  the \nbarrage  of  gunfire.  They  testified  of  the  helplessness  and \nthe  fear  they felt as  they sought  refuge behind any object  in \nthe  unprotected  courtyard. \nWhen  the  shooting  stopped,  they  were  corralled  and \ndirected by  the  guards  and  troopers  to move  into A-Yard.  As \nthey  entered  A-Yard,  they  were  ordered  to  remove  their \nclothing  and  lie  face  down  in  the  mud.  If  they  moved,  they \nwere  beaten  and,  in  some  instances,  shot  by  the  troopers. \nThey  were  humiliated  as  they  lay  nude,  next  to  each  other, \n2 In a  trial held in the New  York  Court  of  Claims  brought \nby  the  widow  of  a  deceased  hostage,  witnesses  estimated  the \nfiring  lasted  from  4  to  12  minutes  during  which  time \n261  rounds  of  12  gauge  \"0011  buckshot  were  fired  discharging \napproximately 3, 000 lethal pellets.  In addition,  an estimated \n103  rounds were  fired from  .357  caliber,  .38  caliber,  and  .270 \ncaliber weapons.  Jones  v.  State of  New  York,  96  A.D.2d  105, \n107  (4th  Dept .  1983),  appeal  denied,  62  N.Y.2d  605  (1984) . \nAlso,  the  testimony  of  Michael  Smith,  a  former  corrections \nofficer  held  hostage  who  was  shot  four  times  during  the \nretaking,  describes  the  intensity of  the  gunfire .  A  summary \nof  his  testimony  appears  in  Appendix  IV  - \"Corroborating \nTestimony.\" \n-Page  17-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 20 of 76\nface  down  in  the  mud  - beaten  if  they  raised  their  heads. \nThey  were  then  ordered  to  get  up  and  move  single  file  with \ntheir hands  over their heads and ordered to run \"the gauntlet\" \nthrough  the A-Yard  tunnel.  As  the  inmates  ran or crawled  or \nstumbled  in  the  tunnel  leading  to  A-Block  with  their  hands \nbehind  their  heads  and  stripped  of  their  clothing,  the \ncorrections officers hit them with their clubs  - calling them \n\"nigger\"  or  \"nigger  lover  S.O.B.\"  and  other  racial  epithets. \nEach  described  the  viciousness  of  the  beatings  with  vivid \ndetail. \nMany  of  the  plaintiffs  could  not  recall  how  many  times \nthey  were  beaten  while  going  from  D-Yard  to  A-Yard  and \neventually  placed  in  a  single  cell  with  three  or  more \ninmates  - all nude  - all  in need of medical  attention.  While \nin  their  cells,  they  were  beaten,  tortured  with  Russian \nroulette,  and  each  was  eventually  given one  baloney  sandwich \n24  hours  later on  September  14,  1971. \nOne  factor was  common among all plaintiffs:  the treatment \nthey  received  stripped  them  of  their  dignity  and  they  felt \ndehumanized,  \"like  garbage.\"  The  force  used  upon  them  after \n-Page  18-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 21 of 76\nthe  retaking ranged  from  brutal  beatings  and  acts  of  torture \nto killings.  As  one former inmate testified,  \"[i] t  was  all so \nunnecessary  - all  they had  to do  was  to wait  it out  - we  had \nnowhere  to go.\" \nThe  events  of  the  morning  of  September  13,  1971  left \nindelible impressions upon each of the plaintiffs after having \nbeen  subjected  to  indignities  and  unwarranted,  brutal \ntreatment.  Although  they  have  left  Attica,  Attica  has  not \nleft them.  After having been assured that nothing would happen \nto them  if they  followed  orders  and proceeded to  the  nearest \ncorrections officer,  they were nonetheless  shot  at and beaten \nin  the  same  instance.  Many  cannot  shed  their bitterness  of \nthat  betrayal.  In a  report  submitted by Dr.  David J.  Barry, \na  psychiatrist,  he  concluded  that  '' [t] he  tragic,  and  yet \ndevastating,  attack  on  the  inmates  by  the  officers  was  a \npsychological  as  well  as  physical  stressor of  such magnitude \nthat  only  a  few  could  be  expected  to  escape  lasting  adverse \neffects.\" \nThe  events  testified  to  by  the  former  inmates  were \ncorroborated in a  comprehensive report prepared on October 7, \n-Page  19-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 22 of 76\n1975  by Justice Berna~d S.  Meyer,  acting as  Special Assistant \nAttorney  General,  submitted  to  then-Governor  Hugh  L.  Carey. \nJustice Meyer  wrote: \nClearly  the  State  has  dealt  unfairly with \nthe  inmates  and  affirmative  action  is \nnecessary  to  correct  the  situation. \nWhether any individual enforcement official \nwas  justified in  firing  the  shots  he  did, \nwhether  some  of  the  shots  fired  resulted \nfrom  malice,  from  emotion  and  hostility, \nimproper planning by the assault commanders \nor their failure properly to instruct their \nmen,  the  fact  that  39  men  died  and  89  men \nwere  wounded  by  enforcement  official \ngunfire  though  the  inmates  had no  firearms \nmakes  indelibly clear  that  more  force  was \nused  then  was  necessary  to  accomplish  the \nretaking. \nWhether malicious or the unfortunate result \nof  false  rumors  of  throat  slitting  and \ncastration,  it  is  evident  from  testimony \nunder oath that  criminal  acts  of brutality \nto  inmates  occurred during  the  rehousing. \nAnd  concern1ng  the  status  of  criminal  investigations, \nJustice Meyer  reported  that: \n[at  present  writing] ,  four  years \nafter  the  riot,  62  inmates  have  been \ncharged  in  42  indictments  with  1,289 \nseparate  counts  while  but  for  one \nindictment,  for  reckless endangerment,  has \nbeen  handed  up  with  respect  to  a  crime  by \na  State Trooper.  (Emphasis  mine.) \n-Page  20-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 23 of 76\nFollowing  the  report,  Governor  Hugh  L.  Carey,  on \nDecember  21,  1976,  announced  that  he  would  pardon  seven \ninmates  and  commute  the  sentence  of  an  eighth  to  \"close  the \nbook\"  on  the  1971  Attica prison riot because  it was, \nirrefutably  clear  that  the  State,  through \nits highest officials,  failed abysmally in \nupholding  [principles  of  evenhanded \njustice]  in  the  handling  of  the  Attica \ninvestigation  and  prosecution \n[therefore]  equal justice by way of further \nprosecutions  is no  longer possible. \nIn so doing,  the State of New  York was  precluded from pursuing \nany criminal charges against any of the officers who  took part \nin  the  retaking  on  September  13,  1971.  \"Attica  lurks  as  a \ndark  shadow  over  our  system  of  justice,\"  Governor  Carey \nconcluded. \nJust because  it is history does  not mean  it is all in the \npast.  Indeed,  Attica  is  the  ghost  that  has  never  stopped \nhaunting  its  survivors  - including  both  the  inmates  and  the \nfamilies  of  the deceased guards  and prison personnel .  But at \nleast  the  settlement  of  this  case  provides  the  basis  for  the \nformer  inmates  to close  the  book  on  the past  and  to  focus  on \n-Page  21-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 24 of 76\nthe future.  It was  best said by Gene Hitchens as he  concluded \nhis  testimony: \nI'm leaving Attica here  today,  your Honor. \nThis  is  where  Attica  ends  for  me  .  .  I \ndon't  want  to  talk about  it  [anymore].  I \ndon't  want  to  live  it again. \nA list of  the claimants and the amount  to be paid to each \nfrom  the  settlement  fund  is  in  Appendix  I  together  with  a \nsynopsis  of  each  claim. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set forth  in my  February 15,  2000  Order, \nand  this  Decision  and  Order,  I  find  that  the  settlement  is \nfair  and  equitable  considering  all  of  the  circumstances \nsurrounding the history of this case.  I  further find that the \nevaluation and distribution plan is fair and equitable and the \nClerk  of  the  Court  is directed to make  payments  to  the  class \nmembers  as  provided  in this Decision  and  Order. \nThe  Settlement  Agreement  presented  to  this  Court  on \nJanuary  4,  2000  is  approved  and  the  case  is hereby  dismissed \nwith prejudice pursuant  to Rule  23(e)  of  the Federal  Rules  of \nCivil  Procedure.  All  class  members  are  therefore  enjoined \n-Page  22-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 25 of 76\nfrom  instituting  or  prosecuting  any  further  action  or \nproceeding  regarding  the  settled claims. \nThe  Clerk  of  the  Court  is  directed  to  distribute  the \nsettlement proceeds from the Attica Settlement Fund on deposit \nin the  Court  Registry  in the  amount  specified herein  to  each \nclaimant  or  his  legal  representative.  The  Clerk  is  also \ndirected to distribute a  proportionate  share of the  remaining \naccrued  interest  earned  by  the  settlement  fund  to  the \nplaintiffs  less  $75,000  to  be  retained  by  the  Clerk  of  the \nCourt as a  contingency fund to be disbursed as may be provided \nby  the  further  order  of  this  Court.  In  all  cases  where  a \nclaim  has  been  filed  on  behalf  of  a  deceased  class  member, \npayment  shall be made  only to the  legal  representative of  the \ndeceased  plaintiff's  estate.  Legal  representatives  must \nprovide  proof  of  their  appointment  by  a  Court  of  competent \njurisdiction. \nThe  Clerk shall not make  any distribution of  funds  until \nthe  time  for  the  appeal  of  this  Decision  and  Order  has \nexpired.  If  an  appeal  is  taken,  no  distribution  of  funds \nshall be  made  until  the  appellate  process  is  concluded. \n-Page  23-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 26 of 76\nFinally,  this Court retains jurisdiction over enforcement \nof  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  all  the  terms  thereof, \nincluding the distribution of the settlement proceeds  and the \naccrued  interest. \nThe  Clerk of  the Court  is hereby directed to  enter final \njudgment  in accordance  with  this Decision and  Order. \nALL  OF  THE  ABOVE  IS  SO  ORDERED. \nMICHAEIJ1:iELESCA \nUnited States District Judge \nDated:  Rochester,  New  York \nAugust  28,  2000 \n-Page  24-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 27 of 76\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 28 of 76\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755   Filed 08/28/00   Page 29 of 76\nSUMMARY  OF  AWARDS \nCATEGORY  PAGE \nAlejandro,  Abelardo  C.

He  was  eventually released \nafter the uprising  in October  1971. \nFollowing the retaking,  he and other prisoners were ordered to place \ntheir hands  on their heads  and to move  single-file into A-Yard.  Once  in \nA-Yard,  they were forced to crawl through the mud,  still with their hands \non  their  heads.  Because  they  could  not  move  fast  enough,  they  were \ncrushed by other inmates  who  were being pushed  and  beaten by guards  and \ntroopers.  Brosig then removed his hands  from his head so he  could crawl \nfaster.

The  same  trooper  shouted  words  and \ncommands  that Mr.  Skinner  was  unable  to understand and  then pushed him \nface  down  into  a  mud  puddle  and  told  him  not  to  move  or  he  would  be \nkilled.  Mr.  Skinner  feared  that  he  would  drown  and  he  swallowed  large \namounts  of water  through  his  mouth  and nose  but  was  eventually able  to \nmove his face enough sidewards to breathe air through his mouth.  He was \nforced  to run the gauntlet  - naked and barefooted over broken glass and \nwas  beaten  viciously.  He  was  placed  in  a  cell  with  two  other  naked \nprisoners  with no  mattress,  blankets,  or  clothing.

He  suffers  from  lasting pain  in his  left \nshoulder and also suffers from  lasting emotional distress in the form of \nanxiety  attacks,  nightmares,  flashbacks,  visual  and  noise  sensitivity, \nand post  traumatic  stress disorder. \nClaim of Mario Armando  Maldonado \nMr.  Maldonado,  who  is  currently  incarcerated  at  Woodbourne \nCorrectional  Facility,  Woodbourne,  New  York,  and  who  was  an  inmate  at \nAttica,  in D-Yard,  on September 13,  1971,  was  forced to jump off the roof \nof  B-Block  catwalk.  He  sprained  his  ankle  and  sustained  bruises  as  a \nresult of jumping a  distance of eight to ten feet.  He  was  singled out for \nbrutal  treatment  by  corrections  officers  and  State  troopers.  A \ncorrections officer threatened to kill him and pointed a  loaded rifle at \nhim  while  at  the  same  time,  other  corrections  officers  beat  him  with \nclubs.  He  tried  to  escape  from  these  corrections  officers  by  running \ntowards  an  open  door  to A-Yard.  A  State  trooper  fired  his  rifle which \ngrazed  the  lower  part  of  his  back  but  he  states  that  the  result  was \n\"bnlisesn.  He  was  chased by two  corrections officers and an  armed State \ntrooper  as  he  ran  from  A-Block  corridor  to  the  cell  hall  area.  He  was \nassaulted  in  the  top  gallery  of  the  A-Block.  Mr.  Maldonado  did . not \nreceive medical  attention and  is not  currently receiving  treatment. \n-51-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 19 of 90\nCla~ of Samuel  Collier \nMr.  Collier  stated  that  on  September  13,  1971  he  was  beaten  in \nD-Yard while  trying  to help  carry a  man  into A-Yard  and was  knocked  to \nthe  ground,  kicked,  beaten  with  night  sticks,  and  forced  to  strip  in \nA-Yard.  He  ran the gauntlet and was beaten again by corrections officers \nand New  York State Troopers. \nHe  was  placed  in a  cell with  thirty to  forty other  inmates,  where \nhe  was  called up  to  the  bars  and  was  jammed  in the  groin with a  night \nstick. \nMinutes  before  the  assault  began,  he  and  eight  to  ten others  had \nbeen told by Herbert Blyden to stay in front  of the hostages and not  to \nlet harm come  to them.  He  was very afraid but did so.  He  claims that the \nharm  to  the  hostages  came  from  the  authority  forces,  both  during  and \nafter the assault. \nHe  stated that since his release from Attica he has been unable to \nhold a  job.  He  still feels  a  great deal of anger inside and becomes very \nupset when  he  sees  films  or documentaries  about  the ~ttica riot. \nClaim of James  R.  Moore \nMr.  Moore,  who  is  currently  incarcerated  at  Gowanda  Correctional \nFacility,  Gowanda,  New York,  and who was  an inmate at Attica,  in D-Yard, \non  September  13,  1971,  was  struck with  an  object  on  his  right  eye.  He \nsustained  a  laceration  an  inch  below  his  eye  and  this  laceration  has \nresulted in a  slight drooping of his right lower eyelid and upper cheek. \nMr.  Moore received medical attention for his injury and is not currently \nunder  treatment.  He  claims  to  suffer  lasting  emotional  distress  in the \nform  of  flashbacks  and hallucinations. \nClaim of Lawrence Blair Jr. \nMr.  Blair, who  is currently incarcerated at the Clinton Correctional \nFacility  at  Dannemora,  was  an  inmate  at  Attica  and  in  D-Yard  on \nSeptember 13,  1971.

He  suffers  from nightmares  on  occasion. \n-52-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 20 of 90\nof Louis Williams \nCla~ \nMr.  Williams stated that he was  in D-Yard on September 13,  1971 and \nwas beaten with sticks by troopers and guards on his head and knees  and, \nas  a  result,  he  suffers  from  arthritis.  He  claims  to  suffer  from \nemotional distress, sleeplessness,  and drug and alcohol abuse as a  result \nof his  experience  during  the Attica retaking. \nClaim of Allen Barnett \nMr.  Barnett stated that his  eyebrows  were burned off when  tear gas \nwas  dropped  in D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971.  He  was  forced  to run the \ngauntlet  and was  beaten badly with \"big clubs.\"  His  left leg was  badly \ncut when he  fell on  some  glass.  He  has a  permanent  scar on his  leg and \nsuffers from unbearable emotional distress.  In a  telephone interview on \nJuly 18,  2000,  Mr.  Barnett stated that it was difficult for him to travel \nto  Rochester,  New  York  because  of  his  work  responsibilities  and  would \nrely on his  written claim. \nof  Joseph Walker \nCla~ \nHilary Spreche~ brought  a  claim on behalf  of her father,  the  late \nJoseph Walker.  She  claims  that while  her  father was  in D-Yard at Attica \non  September  13,  1971,  he  was  beaten  as  he  was  forced  to  run  the \ngauntlet.  She claims that he suffered pain for many weeks  following  the \nbeatings,  and that he  suffered from  lasting emotional  distress. \nClaim of Larry DeBerry \nOn  June  19,  2000,  Mr.  DeBerry provided testimony in support  of his \nclaim.  He  testified  that  he  dropped  to  the  gr~und when  the  shooting \nstarted and  that  he  was  \"scared  to  death\".  He  received  approximately \n60  blows  in the  corridor  between  D-Yard  and A-Yard.  He  testified that \nhis left leg was  so badly beaten that he  has contracted Paget's disease, \nrequiring an operation,  leaving a  permanent scar eight inches in length. \nHe  still has  severe pain in both knees,  necessitating pain killers .  He \nalso  testified  that,  after being placed  in a  cell,  he  asked  for  water \nand,  instead,  was  given a  cup  of  urine  which he  was  forced  to drink at \ngunpoint. \nMr.  DeBerry has submitted in further support of his claim a  medical \nrecord  from  St.  Vincent's  Hospital and Medical  Center of  New  York  dated \n-53-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 21 of 90\nAugust 14,  ~997.  The report reflects that Mr.  DeBerry was diagnosed with \nPaget's  disease of  the  left leg in 1991  and  notes  that he  had a  gunshot \nwound  in his  left leg.  Mr.  DeBerry  testified that  the report  is wrong \nand  that  he  had  not  been shot  in the  leg but  rather,  he  believes,  his \ncurrent problems  with Paget's disease were  caused by the severe beating \nto his  leg at Attica. \nClaim of Charles Robert  Ristau,  Jr. \nMr.  Ristau  was  an  inmate  at  Attica  and  present  in  D-Yard  on \nSeptember  13,  1971.  Prior  to  the  retaking  on  September  13th,  he  was \nassigned by Herbert X.  Blyden to protect the hostages who  were  gathered \nin D-Yard  from  harm by other inmates.  He  assisted in having one  of the \nhostages removed for medical attention because of a  gall bladder attack. \nOn  September  13,  1971,  a  helicopter  dropped  gas  on  D-Yard,  and  he  saw \nCorrections ·Officer Sam Cunningham get shot  three  times.  He  was  struck \nand  beaten by  troopers  while  in D-Yard.  Then,  as  he  went  from  D-Yard \ninto A-Yard,  he ran a  gauntlet and was  beaten viciously.  He  eventually \nwas  placed  in a  cell  in A-Block with three  other  inmates.  He  received \nnothing  to  eat  for  three  days.  The  whole  episode  has  been  very \nemotionally  disturbing  throughout  the  years.  \"It  was  a  horrible \nexperience  - no  matter  how  far  away  [from  Attica]  I  get  - I  can't \nforget.\" \nClaim of Eddie  Peoples \nEddie Peoples,  age 61,  of Buffalo,  New York,  supplemented his claim \nin a  telephone  conference with the  Court  on August  16,  2000.  He  stated \nthat  he  was  in  D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971  and  was  struck  by  law \nenforcement authorities as he passed through the corridor from D-Yard to \nA-Yard.  Once  in A-Yard he  was  told to strip naked,  lie on  the  ground, \nand crawl.  He  was  struck by law enforcement authorities on his back and \nhis  legs.  He  was  then  forced  to  run  through  the  A-Gauntlet  and \neventually placed in a  cell with other inmates  in C-Block.  He  remained \nthere for  three days  and  was  transferred to Comstock.  He  was  afraid to \nask for  medical  attention - •I'd rather do  the time  - I  was  fearful  for \nmy  life.•  He  is  employed  by  the  Buffalo  Board  of  Education  where  he \n-54-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 22 of 90\nhelps scheduling GED  exams.  As a  result of a  dislocated shoulder,  he has \nnot been able to throw a  ball or raise his right arm above his head.  He \ncomplains  of pain in his  lower back  to this day.  \"I never saw  anything \nlike it - it was  so brutal.  I  don't want  to talk about  it.\" \nClaim of O.V.  Atterberry  (f/k/a O.V.  Harris) \nMr.  Atterberry testified on July 26,  2000  that he was  an  inmate  in \nD-Yard on  September  13,  1971.  He  testified that he  was  forced  to strip \nand  ordered  to  lie  face  down  on  the  ground  and  crawl  until  he  was  told \nto  remain  still.  While  crawling,  he  received brush burns  on  his  chest \nthat  remained  sore  for  five  or  six  days.  Thereafter,  he  periodically \nfelt pain in his chest area,  the cause of which went undiagnosed despite \ntesting and x-rays every six months or so.  In 1993,  the pain became more \nintense  and,  following  more  tests,  he  was  diagnosed  in  1994  with  a \ndeterioration of  the  ribs.  He  claims  that the deterioration was  caused \nby  an  Aspergillus  infection.  Aspergillus  is  a  fungus  which  Mr. \nAtterberry  claims  is  commonly  found  in  the  ground  in rural  areas.  He \nbelieves he  contracted the  fungus  while  crawling  in D-Yard.  He  claims \nthat  the majority of his ribs  on his  left  side  were  removed  due  to  the \ninfection.  In  an  addendum  to  his  claim  form,  he  stated  that  he  was \nforced  to  run  the  gauntlet.  Finally,  he  claims  that  he  has  suffered \nemotional  distress. \nAlthough Mr.  Atterberry has  suffered a  serious  injury,  he  has  not \nprovided  any  evidence  to  support  his  claim  that  he  was  exposed  to  the \nAspergillus  fungus  at  the  Attica  in  1971  or  that  such  exposure  was \nresponsible for the deterioration of his ribs which necessitated surgery \n23 years later,  in 1994.  Mr.  Atterberry indicated in his claim form that \nhe would  supply such medical  evidence  and  later testified in Court  that \nsuch  evidence  would  be  forthcoming.  While  the  Court  is mindful  of  the \ndifficulty Mr.  Atterberry has  faced  in getting those records,  the  Court \nis  also  aware  of  its  responsibility  to  the  class  as  a  whole  to  ensure \nthat  the  settlement  proceeds  are  distributed  equitably,  based  on \nverifiable  claims.  Because  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  Mr. \nAtterberry's  claim  regarding  his  ribs,  I  must  discoun.t  that  claim  and \n-55-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 23 of 90\nbase his award solely on his remaining claims of injuries sustained while \nrunning  the gauntlet and being rehoused,  and emotional  distress.  Based \non those  claims,  I  find  that Category I  is the  appropriate category for \nMr.  Atterberry's  claim. \nClaim of Marion Lucas \nMr.  Lucas  of  Buffalo,  New  York,  who  was  an  inmate  at  Attica  in \nD-Yard,  on September 13,  1971,  stated that his upper torso was  beaten in \nthe staircase leading into A-Yard.  He  was forced to strip and run through \nthe A-Gauntlet where he was  struck on his stomach and upper torso.  He  was \nbeaten with sticks and axe handles as well as threatened with death while \nmoving  towards  the cell area.  After he was  placed in a  cell,  corrections \nofficers threatened his  life and beat him  through  the  bars of his  cell. \nMr.  Lucas  did  not  receive  medical  attention  and  is  not  currently \nreceiving  treatment.  He  suffers  from  severe  back  pain  as  a  result  of \nbeing beaten.  He  claims  to suffer from lasting emotional distress in the \nform of nightmares  and  flashbacks. \nClaim of Vernon Manning \nCharlene Davis  of  Brooklyn,  New  York,  brings  this claim on behalf \nof  her  deceased  uncle,  Vernon  Davis,  who  was  an  inmate  at  Attica,  in \nD-Yard,  on  September  13,  1971.  She  claims  that  he  was  threatened  and \nbeaten in D-Yard and in the stairway leading to A-Yard,  as well as  in the \nA-Gauntlet.

Starkes,  age  52  of  Rochester,  New  York  testified  on \nJune 13,  2000  that he was  in D-Yard on September 13,  1971.  He  testified \nthat the helicopters dropped gas on all of the inmates and he fell to the \nground  and  sought  shelter  from  the  shooting.  He  was  told  to  put  his \nhands  over his head.  A trooper struck him in the ribs with a  baton with \nsuch force  that  it cracked one  of his ribs and punctured his  left lung. \nHe  was  in extreme pain for approximately three months and claims  that he \nsuffered pneumonia as a  result.  He  was  forced to run the gauntlet in the \nA-Yard  corridor and  again was  struck  in the  back,  falling  on glass  and \ncutting his left hand.  Two  inmates helped him into A-block where he was \nplaced in a  cell with three inmates.  He  remained  in the  cell for  three \ndays  without  clothing,  bedding,  or food.  He  refused medical  attention \nbecause he did not trust the authorities.  He  eventually sought treatment \nat  Strong  Memorial  Hospital.  He  still has  nightmares  and  flashbacks . \nDuring  his  testimony,  it was  very difficult  for  him  to  talk about  the \nevents. \nClaim of Joseph King \nJoseph  King,  age  51,  of  Buffalo,  New  York,  testified on  June  13, \n2000  that he  found himself  in D-Yard on September 13,  1971  and heard the \nhelicopters approaching and dropping the gas on the inmates.  At the same \ntime,  he saw troopers  lined up on the C-Tunnel  catwalk with weapons.  He \nsaw an  individual  throwing objects from  the helicopter and  thought  they \nwere  hand grenades.  Bullets were  ricocheting hitting off  the walls  and \nall around him.  The  inmates  were  instructed by  the  retaking  forces  to \n-stand  up  and  follow  instructions.n  He  followed  the  instructions  and \nlaid  face  down  on  the  ground  with  his  eyes  burning  from  the  gas.  An \nofficer hit him with a  rifle butt  in  the  right  shoulder which  caused it \n-101-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 69 of 90\nto  be  dislocated.  He  thought  he  was  going  to  die  because  it was  so \npainful.  He  was  then  hit  again  in  the  back  and  buttocks  as  he  went \nthrough  the  gauntlet  and  was  eventually  locked  in  a  cell  in  A-Block. \nFour days  later,  he  finally received medical  attention.  He  remained  in \nthe cell in pain with no  food,  and with inoperative toilets.  The guards \nyelled at the inmates,  \"We  are going to kill all you niggers before it's \nover.\"  It was not until a  National Guardsman came  on the fourth day that \nMr.  King  was  taken  to  the  infirmary  where  his  shoulder  was  relocated \nwithout  anesthetic  or pain medication.  After his  release  from  prison, \nhe  went  to  Meyer  Memorial  Hospital  for  treatment.  In  support  of  his \nclaim,  Mr.  King  also  submitted  the  report  of  Dr.  David  J.  Barry,  a \npsychiatrist,  who  examined  him  in September  of  1994  and  concluded that \nMr.  King was  suffering from  \"long term adverse effects  .  of  chronic \npost  traumatic stress disorder which is the direct result of  the  sudden \nand unanticipated assault at Attica.\"  Dr.  Barry concluded that he  found \nMr.  King  to  be  \"a  very  credible  historian;  I  don't  believe  he  was \nexaggerating the adverse  impact  of  his  disorder.\" \nClaim of Howard L.

He  was  stranded in D-Yard and  testified that by September  13, \n1971 he was  \"cold,  tired,  and hungry,\"  and  \"wanted to get out\" of D-Yard. \nHe  testified that,  although the inmates were told that no harm would come \nto them  if they put  their hands  on  their heads  and moved  toward A-Yard, \nthose  that  did  move  were  shot  or  beaten.  He  stated  that  when  the \nshooting started,  he had  \"no place to go,  no place to run,\"  and  \"thought \n[he)  was  going  to  die.\"  He  testified that  two  troopers  took  aim at an \ninmate who was  in the trench and that one of the troopers told the inmate \nto get  out  of  the  trench,  while the other  told him to keep his hands  on \nhis head.  Mr.  Partridge testified that when  the inmate  (whom  he  did not \nknow)  followed  the  orders  to get out  of  the  trench,  he  was  shot  in the \nchest  by  the  trooper who  told him  to  keep  his  hands  on his head. \n-102-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 70 of 90\nMr.  Partridge testified that he was  struck with batons  and bats on \nhis  neck  and  lower  back  such  that  he  was  temporarily  paralyzed.

He  claims  that he  was  struck on  the head with \nbatons,  and that his finger is deformed from blocking some of  the blows. \nA bone  in his right elbow is chipped from crawling on his elbows  and his \nskin  was  burned  from  tear gas.  He  claims  he  still has  headaches,  and \nbelieves he  has  loss of hearing  from  the blows  to his head,  although he \nwas  unable to submit  any medical proof in support of that suspicion.

Ms.  Scherfner  appeared on July 12,  2000 \nand  testified  in  support  of  the  claim.  Her  father  was  an  inmate  at \nAttica  on  September  13,  1971  and  was  beaten  by  law  enforcement \nauthorities,  and  received a  hard blow  to the  side of his head.

Ms.  Scherfner testified \nthat her  father  told her that he  was  so  terrified of  what  was  going  on \nduring the riot that he decided to commit  suicide before they killed him. \nHe  also sustained an injury to his ear resulting from a  blow to his head \nwhich  was  later diagnosed as  severe  chronic  otitis media.  This  injury \nmanifested  itself  by  constant  leakage  from  his  ear  and  pain  for  many \nyears  and  an  eventual  partial  hearing  loss  necessitating  corrective \nsurgery. \nMs.  Scherfner  provided  extensive  and  detailed  medical  records \ndocumenting  her  father's  mental  problems  which  he  suffered both before \nand  after  he  was  injured  on  September  13,  1971.  He  suffered  from \nrecurrent  nightmares,  difficulty  in  holding  jobs  for  a  long  period of \ntime,  paranoia, withdrawal,  depression,  fear of crowds,  anxiety,  tension, \ninability. to concentrate,  explosive  outbursts,  feelings  of  inadequacy, \nconfusion,  and  memory  loss.  He  took  a  wide  variety  of  psychiatric \nmedication until he  died. \nA doubt  existed as  to whether Mr.  Doris was  in D-Yard because of a \nstatement  in  his  personal  file  given  to  a  Bureau  of  Criminal \nInvestigation officer on September  18,  1971.  However,  his  presence  in \nD-Yard on September  13,  1971  was  verified by Ronald  Coyne  who  also was \nan  inmate  and  last  saw  him  near  the  D-Block  door  in  D-Yard  when  the \nretaking started.  Mr.  Coyne  related that  information to the  Court  in a \ntelephone  interview on July 25,  2000. \nCla~ of  Smith Carson,  Jr. \nSmith  Carson,  Jr.,  age  53,  of  Buffalo,  New  York,  testified  on \nJuly  10,  2000  with  the  assistance  of his  sister,  Barbara  Carson  Jones, \nbecause of a  speech problem.  Mr.  Carson claims that his four front teeth \nwere  knocked out by State troopers and that he was  traumatized by seeing \nthe shooting and killing going on around him.  He  claims to have suffered \nseizures  (and  continues  to  do  so)  as  a  result  of  injuries  received  at \nAttica.  The  top  of  his  head  reveals  a  number  of  scars  which he  claims \ncame  from  beatings  he  received on  September  13,  1971.  He  continues  to \nreceive medication and treatment for his seizures  (he has been prescribed \n-120-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-1   Filed 08/28/00   Page 88 of 90\nDilantin)  and  is  also  being  treated  for  cancer  of  his  mouth  and  jaw \n(which  is  not  related  to  the  injuries  sustained at Attica)  at  Roswell \nPark Cancer Research Clinic. \nof Frederick E.

The  second  time,  he  was  struck in the \nnose,  his back,  and body generally.  Thumbtacks  that had been strewn on \nthe  floor  became embedded in his  feet  as he  ran across  the  floor of the \ncorridor.  He  was  placed  in a  cell  and  guards  played  Russian  roulette \nwith  him.

He  hid in a  fox hole.  A canister of \nthe  tear  gas  fell  near  him,  causing  him  to  vomit,  his  eyes  to  swell \nclosed,  and  his  lips,  nose,  and  lungs  to  burn  as  if  on  fire.  He  was \nordered out  of  the  hole  and made  to  lie in a  puddle of water.  He  heard \nguards  shout his name.  When  they found him,  he was beaten,  stripped,  and \nmade  to  run  the  gauntlet  through  the  A-Block  corridor and  into  a  cell. \nHe  claims  that he  was  beaten unconscious.

He  testified  that,  during  the  riot,  he  was  asked  to  become  the \nhead of the security team which entailed making sure that the inmates  and \nhostages were safe during negotiations and that people  (outsiders)  coming \ninto  the  yard  would  be  safe  from  harm.  He  testified  that  during  the \nretaking,  prison  officials  accused  him  of  castrating  and  cutting  the \nthroats  of  officers held hostage. \nHe  testified  that  on  Monday,  September  13,  1971,  following  the \nretaking,  he was  ordered to strip.  As he walked through a  doorway,  he was \nstruck to the ground,  wearing only a  sweatshirt.  He  was then beaten with \nbilly clubs,  axe  handles,  and pick handles  on his  arms,  legs,  back,  and \nneck.  His  clothing was  taken,  and he was  forced to lie naked in the cold, \nwet mud.  He  testified that he was  then  identified as one of the  \"leaders\" \nof the revolt and as a  person who  castrated a  corrections officer.  He  was \ntold he  would be  castrated and was  taken  to  a  table where  he  was  forced \nto lie down.  After ten minutes on the table,  a  corrections officer placed \na  football  under  his  chin  and  told him  i f  he  moved  he  would  be  killed. \n(According  to Smith,  this was  done  because  the  guards  believed he  liked \nto play football) .  As  he  lay on  the table,  hot,  spent shell casings  and \ncigarette butts were dropped on him and he tried to flex his body without \nmovement  in an attempt to get the lighted cigarettes to roll  off his body. \nA  corrections  officer  continually  prodded  his  genitals  and  they  were \nstruck numerous  times during the five hours  that he lay on the table.  He \nbelieved  that  he  would  die  because  the  pain  intensified  and  became \nexcruciating and  the  guards  taunted  him  continuously.  He  felt  violated \nand helpless. \nHe  eventually  was  forced  to  get  up  from  the  table,  but  he  fell \nbecause his  legs  had gone  •deadn  from  hanging  over  the edge,  motionless, \nfor  so  long.  He  was  then  taken  to run  the gauntlet where  he  was  beaten \n-174-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 52 of 89\nby 20  to 50  officers,  all armed with batons or axe handles,  on both sides \nof a  corridor littered with broken glass .  After running the gauntlet,  he \nwas  moved  from  one  location  to  another  and  was  continually  beaten  or \nwhipped.  One  of  the  blows  to  the  left  side  of  his  head  caused  it to \n\"split\"  and  he  passed  out.  He  regained  consciousness  and  found  himself \nin a  dark,  empty room.  Officers came  in,  forced him to  lie spread eagle \non  the  floor,  and  told him  that he  would be  castrated.  The  guards  also \nthreatened  him  by playing Russian  roulette using  their weapons.  He  was \nterrified and  \"prayed for  [my]  life.\" \nHe  was  then placed on  a  stretcher,  his  open head wound  was  dressed \nby a  medic  who was  a  New  York National Guardsman and who  pleaded with the \nofficers  to stop beating Mr.  Smith.  He  was  taken to Housing Block Z via \nan elevator,  where he was  dumped on the floor and made  to lie on his back \nwith his feet up  against the side of the elevator.  Once at Housing Block \nZ  he  was  placed  in  a  cell without  clothes  or  a  blanket.  While  in the \ncell,  a  shotgun  barrel was  pointed at his head between his  eyes  and  the \ntrigger  pulled.  He  was  terrified.  He  claims  that  he  began  urinating \nblood but  received no medical  attention.  He  remained nude and without  a \nblanket for  at least two  days. \nUpon  release from prison,  he was  haunted by the memories  of Attica. \nHe  often found himself  angry,  and constantly experienced nightmares.  He \nstarted using drugs as a  response to the anger he felt .  He  went  into drug \nrehabilitation in 1986 and has not used drugs or alcohol since that time. \nHe  became  a  born-again Christian and  testified that he  \"can forgive,  but \n. . .  can't  forget  .  .\"  He  testified that  it was  \"more  important  to me \nthan anything\"  to be given the opportunity to tell his story in Court and \nexplain his role in the uprising,  and what really happened at Attica.  He \ndid  not  cause  any  harm  to  any  hostage  but  instead  was  given  the \nresponsibility  to see  to  it that  no  harm  would  come  to  them.  He  feels \nthat  the  families  of  the  deceased  guards  and  prison  administration \npersonnel should be compensated for their losses as well because  •they got \na  bum  deal.\" \n-175-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 53 of 89\nHe  still experiences nightmares,  flashbacks,  pain in his head,  and \nproblems with his wrists. He  experiences pain on occasion when urinating, \nand testified that sexual acts are very painful for him which has rendered \nhim permanently disabled. \nClaim of Gary Haynes \nGary Haynes  has  submitted a  detailed written account  of his claims \nand testified on May  30,  2000.  He  alleges that because of his  shorthand \nand  typing  skills,  he  was  pressed  into  service  to  transcribe  the  record \nof all negotiations between inmates and authorities during the riot.  Due \nto  his  involvement,  Mr.  Haynes  believes  that  he  was  singled out  by  the \nretaking forces  for particularized treatment as a  \"leader\" of the revolt. \nHe  claims  that,  when  the  retaking  began  on  the  morning  of \nSeptember 13,  1971,  he hid behind a  table when  the shooting started until \nan  officer  found  him,  kicked  him  in  the  ribs  and  told  him  to  get  up, \nleading  him  to  A-Block  Yard.  The  guards  pushed  him  down  the  stairs \nleading into A-Yard.  Once in A-Yard,  he was  told to strip and join a  long \nline  of naked  inmates,  snaking  its way  single-file across  A-Yard  toward \nA-Block  Corridor.  An  officer  identified  him  as  \"a  leader\"  and  he  was \ntaken out of  the  line and verbally threatened.  He  was  then told to lie \non his back on the ground with his knees  bent up  and a  shotgun shell was \nplaced on his right kneecap.  He  was  told that if the shell fell  from his \nknee,  he  would be  killed.  Haynes  submitted a  photograph  (Exhibit  #4)  in \nevidence  showing him lying naked  on the ground  (near  \"Big Black\")  with a \nshotgun  shell  balanced  on  his  knee.  He  remained  in  that  position  from \nmorning until dusk,  being subjected to officers spitting on him,  throwing \nlit cigarettes on him,  swearing at him and threatening  to kill him. \nMr.  Haynes  testified that,  after all of  the other  inmates  had been \nremoved from D-Yard,  a  corrections sergeant sodomized him with the barrel \nof a  shotgun.  Mr.  Haynes  was  then handcuffed and foot-shackled and forced \nto  run  through  A-Corridor  over  broken  glass  and  was  placed  in  Housing \nBlock Z  (•HBZ'\"  or  \"The  Box\"),  where  the  \"leaders\"  were  being housed.  On \nthe  way  to Z-Block,  he  was  forced  to  climb a  stairway  lined with guards \nholding  rifles,  plank  boards,  and  night  sticks  and  was  struck  in  the \nchest,  back,  legs,  arms,  feet and head.  Once he made  it to the top of the \n-176-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 54 of 89\nstairs,  he was kicked so hard in the stomach that he  fell down the stairs \nand was  again forced  to run the gauntlet up  the stairs. \nHe  was  then placed in a  cell  (with no mattress or water)  and when he \nattempted  to urinate,  he  discharged pure  blood  (with extreme pain) .  He \ninformed a  guard of his need for medical  attention but received none  for \nseven days. \nMr.  Haynes  claims  that  he  has  suffered  permanent  damage  to  his \nkidneys  (with resulting complications),  requiring over 60  hospital stays \nfrom September 13,  1971  to date.  In 1990,  he underwent hemodialysis and, \nin 1994,  received a  kidney transplant at the University Medical  Center in \nSyracuse.  He  was  hospitalized  for  56  days  and  underwent  four  surgical \nprocedures  to  correct  his  bladder  function.  He  is  currently  taking \nprescription immuno-suppressants and steroids which he claims have caused \nhim  to  have  side  effects  and  other  maladies  (including  skin  cancer, \nbrittle  bones,  and  torn  muscles).  He  submitted  evidence  of  various \njudgments  against  him  for  unpaid  medical  fees  and  related  expenses \ntotaling over  $15,600.00. \nMr.  Haynes  submitted  a  medical  record  verifying  the  medical \ntreatment  he  received on September 20,  1971.  He  also testified that his \nphysician,  Dr.  Schrader,  has  informed him that the  injuries he  sustained \nat Attica have  contributed to his  current medical  problems. \nClaim of Charles  L.  Williams \nMr.  Williams  testified in support of his claim on May  31,  2000.  He \nclaims that on September 13,  1971,  he was  hit on the  top of his head with \na  rifle butt,  and was  beaten on  his back,  shoulders  and  right  leg while \non  the A-Yard  steps.  He  was  struck across  the  legs  with a  baseball  bat \nand was  forced to run the gauntlet.  He  did not  receive medical attention \nfor  his  injuries  because  none  was  available  at  the  time.  The  blood \nvessels  in his right  leg were  so severely damaged  from  the beatings that \namputation below the knee was  required in 1998.  He  also has problems with \nhis  shoulders  and  suffers  from  post  traumatic  stress  disorder,  alcohol \nabuse,  nightmares,  and  flashbacks.  He  states  that  he  has  been disabled \nfor  ten  years  and  has  received  Social  Security  Disability  benefits. \nMr.  Williams'  principal  concern in giving his  testimony was  to •just  let \n-177-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 55 of 89\nthe  truth be known\"  about  what  happened to  the  inmates  on  September 13, \n1971.  He  states that,  ~[n]o amount  of money  is going  to pay me  for what \nI  went  through.\" \nClaim of James K.  Moss \nOn  June  19,  2000,  Mr.  James  Moss  testified that,  on  September  13, \n1971,  he was  hit with shrapnel from gunfire and was beaten in both D-Yard \nand A-Yard.  He  testified that he was  forced  to  lie face  down  in the mud \nin D-Yard and was beaten and kicked all over his body.  He  testified that \nboth of his hands were broken with a  pick axe handle,  and that he did not \nreceive medical care until he was transferred to Great Meadow Correctional \nFacility.  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  immediate  treatment,  both of  his \nhands  are permanently and significantly deformed and he  is disabled.  He \ntestified  that  he  was  terrorized  in  his  cell  and  was  afraid  to  seek \nmedical attention.  He  claims to still suffer from severe post traumatic \nstress  disorder.  In  summing  up  the  ills of Attica,  Mr.  Moss  told the \nCourt  that  inmates  to be  educated\"  while  in prison. \n~need \nClaim of Nicholas  Goyco  Morales \nMr.  Morales  testified that he was  on the catwalk when  the  shooting \nbegan  and  that  he  witnessed  four  or  five  inmates  getting  shot.  He \ntestified that he was  shot just below the right knee,  and as a  result has \nrestricted movement.  He  stated that when  the troopers  entered the yard, \nhe  saw  a  trooper tell an  inmate not  to move,  and then fatally shoot  that \ninmate.  According  to Morales,  that  inmate's body  landed on him when  he \nwas  shot.  He  testified that he  laid on  the ground  for  a  long period of \ntime before being taken on a  stretcher to receive medical  attention.  He \ntestified  that  when  he  was  lifted on  the  stretcher a  doctor  kicked  the \ninjured  limb  which  was  hanging  off  the  side  of  the  stretcher \n~held \ntogether  only  by  the  skin.\"  His  post-injury  medical  treatment  was \nextensive and involved complicated treatment for infection and gangrene. \nHe  state that,  \"I  have  only one  good  leg out  of  two.\" \nIn addition to suffering physically,  Mr.  Morales  testified that he \nhas also suffered emotionally,  stating that  \"[t)hey killed me  [that day]• \nand  that  • [p] eople  came  in  like  machines  prograrruned  to  destroy  life \nwithout  regard.• \n-178-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 56 of 89\nMr.  Morales  testified  that  in  addition  to  being  shot  on \nSeptember 13,  1971,  he was  also severely burned on September 9th,  when he \nattempted to rescue a  guard that he had locked in the tailor shop  for the \nguard's own  safety.  When  he  realized the building was  on fire,  he  went \nto rescue him,  only to be  burned in the  attempt.  He  testified that  the \nguard fortunately had been able to escape  out a  back entrance or window. \nIn  summarizing  his  experience  at Attica,  Mr.  Morales  said  that  he \nhas wrestled with the legacy of Attica,  but that he  \"cannot find a  way of \nhealing.\"  He  succinctly testified that  \"[t]here is no  cure  for  this.\" \nClaim of  Jerome  Samuel  Rosenberg \nMr.  Rosenberg testified in support of his claim on July 17,  2000 via \nteleconference  call  from  Wende  Correctional  Facility  infirmary. \nMr.  Rosenberg claims that he was  in D-Yard on September 13,  1971 and that \nhe  was  singled  out  as  a  \"leader\"  by  retaking  forces  for  particularly \nbrutal treatment due  to his role as a  member of the negotiating team.  He \nalleges extensive physical injuries and acts of vicious torture.  When he \nwas  in D-Yard,  he  received a  gunshot wound  to his left knee,  burns  to his \neyes and skin from pepper gas,  bruises and abrasions  from severe beatings \nwith clubs  and kicks  from State troopers. \nIn A-Yard,  he  received  a  fractured  skull  from  a  blow  to  his  head \nwith  the  butt  of  a  Thompson  sub-machine  gun  or  semi-automatic  weapon, \nrendering him dazed or unconscious.  He  also stated that every rib in his \nbody  was  broken  from  blows  of  a  gun  butt  and  that  his  lungs  collapsed. \nHe  also asserts that his right elbow was  fractured in A-Yard and that his \nbroken bones have never properly healed.  When  he ran the gauntlet,  he was \nkicked  in the stomach by  a  trooper,  clumps  of  his  hair were  ripped  from \nhis head,  and his  feet  were  severely cut  by  the broken glass. \nHe  claims  that he was  taken  to Housing  Block  Z  or  \"the Box\",  where \nhe was viciously struck in the face with a  heavy tire chain,  resulting in \ndamage  to the optical nerve of his right eye,  neck vertebra injuries,  and \nsevered trigeminal  nerves.  He  claims  that his  left knee  cap  (which  had \npreviously been shot)  was  broken by a  blow from  a  rifle butt.  He  claims \nthat he received more beatings and was  thrown down  three flights of stairs \nby guards  returning him from the infirmary on September 14,  1971.  He  was \n-179-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 57 of 89\ndenied food,  water,  light,  a  mattress,  bedding,  heat,  clothing,  and any \nmedical  attention  for  nearly  48  hours  and  that  he  was  subjected  to \nconstant  death threats. \nMr.  Rosenberg testified that he has suffered permanent injuries such \nas neurological damage,  including a severed trigeminal facial nerve, which \ncauses excruciating pain and requires constant pain medication.  He  claims \nthat he has undergone  five  operations on his head to alleviate the pain, \nall to no  avail,  and that any further surgery would result in paralysis. \nHe  has permanent damage  to the left half of his heart,  which has  resulted \nin several heart attacks  and numerous  angina episodes.  He  has  also had \ncongestive  heart  failure  and  edema.  He  asserts  that  he  has  had  three \nmajor open-heart  operations,  as  well  as  several heart  catherization and \nangioplasty procedures.  He  stated that,  in 1986,  he had a  double by-pass \noperation during which he  died on  the operating  table but  was  revived. \nHe  claims  permanent  damage  to  the  optical  nerve  of  his  right  eye  and \npermanent  scarring  below  the  eye.  He  claims  that  he  had  twelve  teeth \nknocked  out,  requiring  bridgework  and  dentures.  He  claims  to  have  ten \ndeformed  ribs  and  advanced  sclerosis of  the  spine,  as  well  as herniated \ndiscs.  He  asserts  that he  is in constant pain and must  generally use  a \nwheelchair.  He  said that  he  had  collapsed  lungs  which  resulted  in his \ncurrent emphysema  and end-stage  lung disease,  which requires 24-hour use \nof  oxygen.  He  has  had  a  series  of  transient  ischemic  attacks  two \n~nd \nstrokes.  He  claims  to  have  an  inoperable  aortic  aneurysm  which  could \nburst at any time,  causing instant death. \nMr.  Rosenberg also claims to suffer from lasting emotional distress, \nincluding  chronic  post  traumatic  stress  disorder,  which  causes \nhyperactivity and bouts  of  depression. \nClaim of Bernard Stroble \nLinda Borus brings  this claim as the administrator of  the Estate of \nBernard Stroble,  who  died in 1982.  Ms.  Borus  testified on July 18,  2000 \nthat on  September 13,  1971,  while an  inmate at Attica in D-Yard,  Stroble \nwas  shot in the back near his spine,  and in his hands during the retaking. \nHe  was  carried into A-Yard by fellow inmates,  where,  after laying on the \nground for  hours,  he  was  taken by stretcher to  the prison hospital.  He \n-180-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 58 of 89\nlay with 50 or so other prisoners along the wall of the hospital where he \nagain had to wait  for a  doctor to examine him.  Later,  when  taken back to \na  cell block,  he was  dumped off of his  stretcher and beaten by a  group of \napproximately six guards,  including one  who  stuck him repeatedly with a \nscrewdriver.  He  was  put  into a  cell by himself  and was  threatened with \ndeath.  The  next  morning  he  was  taken  to a  hospital,  where  surgery was \nperformed on his hands  to  try to remove  bullets which had  lodged in both \nwrists,  and near his spine.  Ms.  Borus claims that her husband experienced \nphysical  and  emotional pain until he  died in 1982. \nClaim of Akil  al-Jundi  (a/k/a  Herbert Scott Dean) \nMr.  Daniel  Meyers  of  New  York  City  files  this  claim  on  behalf  of \nAkil Al-Jundi,  who  was present in D-Yard at Attica Correctional Facility \non September 13,  1971.  Mr.  Al-Jundi,  who  died August  13,  1997,  was  one \nof the primary leaders of the Muslim inmates who  guarded the hostages and \nkept  them safe during  the  riot.  Mr.  Meyers  claims  that Mr.  Al-Jundi was \nshot  in the  left hand by a  .270  rifle while guarding the hostage  circle. \nThe damage  to his hand was  so serious  that he could see through his hand. \nHe  was  also hit by a  bullet fragment  under his  right  eye.  He  was  forced \nto go down  the A-Steps while being beaten,  was  forcibly stripped,  made to \ncrawl  in the mud  and beaten through the A-Gauntlet.  He  was  then placed on \na  stretcher by National  Guard medics  and placed against  a  fence  outside \nthe hos~ital with about  forty other wounded prisoners on  stretchers. \nWhile  he  was  lying  on  the  ground,  he  saw  corrections  officers \ntorturing another Muslim leader,  James  Richey,  by using their rifles and \nsticks  and  jabbing  them  in Richey's  abdominal  gunshot  wounds.  To  divert \ntheir attention,  Al-Jundi sat up  on his stretcher and began to chant.  The \nofficers turned on him,  dumped him on  the ground and beat him with clubs \nuntil he was  re-housed in a  cell in Housing Block Z.  Still bleeding badly \nseveral hours later, he was  finally transferred to the hospital where his \nhand was  bandaged,  and he was given stitches for a  gash on his head,  along \nwith  two  aspirin.  Two  days  later,  he  was  allowed  to  see  a  surgeon  with \nexpertise in hand reconstruction.  The surgeon performed sixteen major and \nsixteen minor operations  to reconstruct  the hand,  including bone grafts, \nskin  grafts  and  insertion  of  plastic  implant  over  the  hole.  At  the \n-181-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 59 of 89\nsurgeon's  order,  he  was  transferred  to  Meyer  Hospital  on  September  17, \n1971,  where he remained until December.  Just before he was transferred to \nMeyer Memorial Hospital, corrections officers took Mr.  Al-Jundi out of his \ncell,  telling him  that they were  going  to bury him alive.  They  took him \nto a  remote area of the prison and put him in a  big hole,  telling him that \n\"Allah would not help him.\"  They  kept him  in the  hole  torturing him  for \na  long  time  before  finally  taking  him  out  and  releasing him  to  outside \nhospital  care. \nMr.  Al-Jundi' s  face  and  left  hand  were  permanently  scarred  by \ngunshot  injuries.  Use  of  his  left  hand  was  permanently  impaired.  He \nsuffered flashbacks,  nightmares,  severe avoidance problems.  Prior to his \ndeath on August  13,  1997,  Mr.  Al-Jundi acted as the lead plaintiff in the \nAttica case working to obtain damages  for the inmates injured in the riot. \nof James  Rufus  Tatum \nCla~ \nMr.  Robert Tatum,  of Buffalo,  New York files this claim on behalf of \nhis  deceased brother,  James  Rufus  Tatum,  who  was  an  inmate  in D-Yard at \nAttica on September  13,  1971.  He  claims his brother was  shot  in the head \nduring  the  retaking  and  spent  several months  recovering  in Erie  County \nMedical  Center.  He  claims  that  as  a  result  of  the  head  wound  his  late \nbrother suffered from  seizures until his death on September 11,  1988. \nCla~ of Angel Vazquez Villanueva \nMr.  Villanueva,  age  60,  of Hatillo,  Puerto Rico,  was  an  inmate at \nAttica,  in D-Yard,  on  September  13,  1971.  He  supplemented  his  written \nclaim  in  telephone  conversations  on  July  17,  2000  and August  17,  2000. \nBecause he resides in Puerto Rico and has  limited financial resources,  he \nchose  to have  the Court  rely upon his written claim form  supplemented by \ninformation supplied in his  telephone interviews. \nOn  September  13,  1971,  he  was  standing by B-Block corner in D-Yard \nwhen  suddenly State troopers,  wearing gas masks  with rifles,  entered the \nYard.  He  was  shot  four  times  in his  left leg and  thrown  to the ground. \nWhen  on the ground,  he was  shot again in his right leg.  He  was unable  to \nidentify who  shot him because they were wearing gas masks.  He  laid on the \nground  for  a  while and then he was  taken to  the  prison hospital where he \nwas  given  a  blood  transfusion  in  the  hallway  and  some  medication.  He \n-182-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 60 of 89\nremained  in  the  prison  hospital  for  three  to  four  days  and  then  was \ntransferred to Meyer  Memorial  Hospital  in Buffalo where  he  remained  for \nfour months.  He  received operations  to his left leg to repair veins and \narteries.  Bones  were  fractured  by  the  gunshot  wound  and  his  leg  was \nplaced in a  cast.  He  was  in a  body cast from his waist to the bottom of \nhis legs  for about a  month.  He  still has no feeling  in the right leg and \nhe  walks  with great difficulty and pain.  He  is only capable of  sleeping \ntwo  to  three  hours  at  night  because  he  is haunted by  nightmares  of  the \nevent.  He  claims  to suffer from  lasting emotional distress  and  suffered \na  nervous  breakdown.  He  still  is  under  doctor' s  care  for  pain  and \nemotional  distress.  He  can only work  odd  jobs because of his  disability. \nClaim of Willie James  Sullivan \nWillie James Sullivan a/k/a Shareef B.  Thabit,  age 58,  of Ft.  Myers, \nFlorida  testified  in  support  of  his  claim  on  June  28,  2000.  On \nSeptember 13,  1971,  he  was  a  member of  the security team which protected \nnegotiators who  entered D-block.  He  also maintained a  part of a  security \nperimeter  surrounding  the  hostages  in  the  center  of  D-Yard.  The \nhelicopter  came  over  and  dropped  gas  and  he  heard  shooting  from  the \nhelicopter.  He was shot in his back  (right scapula)  and lay on the ground \nin the mud.  A  trooper  came  along and  ordered him  to  stand up  with his \nhands  over  his  head.  Because  of  the  wound,  he  was  unable  to  raise  his \nhand to his head.  A trooper ordered him to remove  a  football helmet  that \nhe was wearing for protection,  and proceeded to kick the helmet off of his \nhead,  leaving  a  permanent  scar on  his  left  forehead.  He  was  one  of  the \nlast wounded  to be  removed  from  D-Yard  to  the  infirmary  and  it was  not \nuntil later in the afternoon of September 13,  1971 that he was  eventually \ntaken  by  ambulance  to  Meyer  Memorial  Hospital  in Buffalo,  New  York.  A \ncorrections  officer  escorted him  and  told him,  \"Nigger,  we' re  going  to \nopen  the  door  on  this  ambulance  and  dump  you  into  the  road  when  we  get \nover the top of the hill so that a  truck can run over you.n  The  ambulance \nthen  stopped,  and  the  officer  opened  the  back  doors.  Mr.  Sullivan \ntestified that  he prayed they would not  dump  him onto  the  road and  that \nthe  ambulance  did  eventually  resume  toward  Buffalo.  He  testified,  •J \nthought  I  was  going  to die but God  saved me.w  Two  bullet fragments  were \n-183-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 61 of 89\nremoved at the hospital,  and it was  determined that the bullet was  fired \nfrom  a  .270  caliber  weapon.  He  developed  an  infection  in  the  wound \nrequiring a  graft.  The  first graft was  rejected and a  second graft was \nplaced on the wound site.  The second graft took place on October 5,  1971. \nPictures  introduced which were  recently  taken reveal  a  large wound  site \nin  the  right  back,  upper  quarter.  \"The  wound  healed  itself,\" \nMr.  Sullivan  testified.  He  is  rmable  to  raise  his  right  arm  to  full \nextension and  is permanently disabled from  the  injury. \nClaim of Edward Kowalczyk \nMr.  Kowalczyk testified at the Batavia Federal Detention Facility in \nBatavia,  New  York  on  August  2,  2000.  He  is  currently  incarcerated  at \nSouthport  Correctional  Facility,  and was  an  inmate  at Attica and  claims \nto  have  received  multiple  grmshot  wounds  on  September  13,  1971.  He \nreceived  a  gunshot  wormd  to  the  left  side  of  his  head  near  his  temple \nwhich  lodged  behind  his  left  ear  and  was  later  surgically  removed.  He \nclaims  to  have  sustained  multiple  gunshot  wounds  to  the  chest,  two  of \nwhich resulted from bullets which went  through his chest and lodged in the \nupper left and right back areas,  and were also later removed.  He  was  also \nshot  in  the  right  leg below  the  knee  and  again  in his  genital  area.  He \nalso sustained a  bullet fragment  in his  right wrist.  In total,  he  claims \nto  have  undergone  surgery  at  least  four  times  for  removal  of \nbullets/bullet fragments.  Mr.  Kowalczyk has submitted medical records from \nMeyer Memorial Hospital showing that he was  admitted on September 13,  1971 \nwith gunshot  wounds  in the  chest,  abdomen,  back,  and base  of  the penis . \nThe  records  reflect that  he  underwent  surgery on September  18,  1971  and \nOctober  20,  1971  for  removal  of  the bullets  from  his back. \nAs  he  lay  waiting  for  hours  for  transportation  to  an  outside \nhospital,  he was  struck by a  corrections officer on the left side of his \nhead with a  club.  He  feels that  the delay in receiving medical  treatment \ncaused many inmates to bleed to death.  Today,  he suffers from insomnia and \nnightmares. \nClaim of Alfred D.  Plummer \nAlfred  D.  Plummer  currently  incarcerated  at  Clinton  Correctional \nFacility,  testified at the Batavia Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, \n-184-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 62 of 89\nNew  York  on  August  2,  2000.  He  was  present  in  D-Yard  at  Attica  on \nSeptember 13,  1971 and initially sustained a  gunshot wound  to his abdomen \nin the corridor between D-Block and A-Yard.  He  was  also shot  in his leg. \nA trooper ordered him to get up and walk out into A-Yard but he was unable \nto  do  so.  The  trooper  assumed  that  he  was  unwilling  to  respond  to his \ncommand when,  in fact,  he was  incapable of walking.  The trooper then shot \nhim in the head with a  handgun.  Two  troopers dragged him into A-Yard and, \nas he was  bouncing down  the steps into A-Yard,  he regained consciousness. \nEach  trooper  had  one  of  his  arms  and  they  were  dragging  him  down  the \nsteps.  He  was  then ·taken  back  to  D-Block  where  one  of  the  doctors  -\nDr.  Williams kicked him and said \"[w]ho's this?\"  The  troopers responded, \n\"(t]hat's  Plummer\"  and  they kicked him.  He  next  regained consciousness \nin the morgue.  He  was  placed there  and given up  for dead.  The  National \nGuard medics  were  examining  each  of  the  bodies  in  the  morgue  and  found \nthat he  and  two  other prisoners were  still alive.  He  was  then  taken to \nMeyer  Memorial  Hospital where  he  underwent  extensive  surgery  for  repair \nto  his  abdomen  and  spine.  He  underwent  a  colostomy  for  damage  to  his \nintestines.  He  underwent  separate surgery for  the removal  of the bullet \nin his brain.  The procedure was described as a  left occipital craniotomy \nwhich was  done on September 13th.  Subsequent surgeries were performed for \nthe removal of the colostomy and for the insertion of a  metal plate in his \nskull to cover the bullet wound  damage  to the skull. \nHe  has  suffered loss  of peripheral vision in his right  eye  and has \ndeveloped  epilepsy  from  the  brain  damage  and  is  taking  Dilantin  daily. \nAll  these  injuries were  imposed upon  him without  any  provocation on his \npart.  He  continues  to have recurring nightmares and of \"being shot in the \nhead at point blank range.\" \nClaim of  Chris  Reed  (a/k/a Oji  Reed) \nMr.  Reed,  of  Renssalaer,  New  York,  provided  testimony on  July 25, \n2000  in  support  of  his  claim.  Mr.  Reed  was  present  in  D-Yard  on \nSeptember  13,  1971  and was  21  years  old at  that  time.  He  received  four \ngunshot  wounds  to his  lower  left leg.  He  testified that a  bullet  in his \nleft  thigh  •exploded  and  took  out  a  big  chunk•  of  his  leg.  Medical \nrecords confirm that he  •sustained  [a]  high velocity wound of the proximal \n-195-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 63 of 89\nleft tibia and fibula with large soft tissue loss.\"  He  testified that he \nwas also shot once in the right foot.  While in D-Yard,  after Mr.  Reed had \nbeen shot,  troopers debated in front of him whether to kill him or let him \nbleed to death.  Some  troopers  jammed  their rifle butts into his  injured \nlegs  and dumped lime onto Mr.  Reed's  face  and  injured legs.  Eventually, \nhe became unconscious  and was  moved  to where  the dead  inmates were kept. \nHe  testified  that,  when  he  awoke,  he  was  \"stacked  up  with  the  dead \nbodies\".  He  was handcuffed behind his back with plastic cuffs.  The lime \nin his face and eyes burned so badly that he tried to rub his face in the \nbloody  mud  puddles  where  he  was  lying.  He  was  eventually  placed  on  a \nstretcher where law enforcement officials jerked on his wounded left leg. \nHe  passed out again from  the pain. \nSubsequently a  cast was  placed on his  leg which only aggravated the \ninjury.  The cast was removed at Attica.  Mr.  Reed testified that he awoke \nto the pain of having  the cast cut off.  He  testified that he  could feel \nthe instrument cutting into his leg and that he screamed in agony but was \ntold to \"shut up\".  He  still has  scars  on his upper thigh from  the cuts. \nHis  left  leg  was  amputated  at  the  knee  on  September  16,  1971,  at \nMeyer  Memorial  Hospital  after  his  leg  became  gangrenous  due  to  the \ninadequate  medical  care  he  received  at Attica.  To  complicate  matters, \nMr.  Reed testified that his mother was  told by the authorities that he was \ndead  and was  called to  the hospital  to identify the body.  He  testified \nthat,  when  she  arrived  and  saw  him  move,  she  immediately  had  a  heart \nattack.  Two  additional surgeries were  later performed to close the stump \non Mr.  Reed's amputated left leg.  He  testified that he has suffered many \nproblems  with the  prosthetic devices  he has  used over the past 28  years. \nMedical records do reflect that his leg amputation has caused several side \neffects,  including chronic painful ulceration in the back of his left knee \narea  and back pain. \nMr.  Reed  continues  to  suffer  from  severe  emotional  distress, \nalthough  he  has  commendably  moved  on  with  his  life  to  graduate  from \ncollege,  marry,  raise  two  sons,  and  currently work  as  a  tax  auditor  for \nthe State of  New  York. \n-186-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 64 of 89\nClaim of Brie Thompson  (a/k/a Cleveland Jomo  Davis) \nMr.  Davis,  who  is currently incarcerated at Deerfield Correctional \nCenter  in  Capron,  Virginia,  claims  that  he  was  an  inmate  at  Attica  on \nSeptember 13,  1971,  and was present in D-Yard.  When  the  shooting began, \nMr.  Davis  was  struck on  his  upper  left  arm  with  a  shotgun  bullet which \n\"ripped  open  the  inside  of  my  left  arm\".  A  fellow  inmate  carried \nMr.  Davis  into D-Corridor,  where  he  remained until  the  troopers  entered \nthe yard.  While  in the  corridor,  and  after having  already been  shot  in \nhis  arm,  Davis  was  shot  six  more  times  in  his  neck  and  back  by  a \ncorrections officer who  shouted  \"  die nigger,  die.\"  He  was  then ordered \nto  crawl  to A-Yard  and  was  kicked  repeatedly  because  he  was  unable  to \ncrawl  \"fast enough\" .  He  was  stripped and dragged to A-Block where he fell \nunconscious. \nWhen he regained consciousness,  Mr.  Davis heard a  National Guardsman \npleading with a  prison doctor to give Davis medical attention.  The doctor \nhowever  said that  there  was  nothing wrong  with Davis  and  that he  should \nbe put back  in his  cell.  After spending a  night  in a  cell,  he  was  taken \nto  a  hospital  room where  the  same  doctor  refused to  treat him.  Another \ndoctor,  however,  finally treated Mr.  Davis's  arm,  but his neck  and back \nwounds  remained  untreated.  Mr.  Davis  has  supplied  medical  records \nindicating his various bullet wounds,  and states that \"0011  buckshot,  .270 \nbullets,  and bullets from mid to high-caliber pistols were taken from his \nbody.  He  was  given little or no pain medication while  in the  hospital, \neven while undergoing  skin graft operations,  in which  skin from his  leg \nwas  removed and grafted onto his  chest and arms.  He  was  then only given \naspirin for his pain. \nAlthough  Mr.  Davis  had  lost  significant  amounts  of  blood  from  the \nwounds  and  surgery,  he  was  not  given  a  transfusion  until  after  the \nsurgery,  when  he  was  transferred to a  non-prison hospital.  He  was  then \ngiven three units  of  what  turned out  to be  the  wrong  blood type,  causing \nfurther adverse reactions.  He  was  returned to Attica where he was  housed \nin the  Special  Housing Unit  and was  denied  further medical  care. \nMany  of  the bullets  in Mr.  Davis's  body  were never  removed  because \nthey are lodged near his spine and kidney,  and removal would require high \n-187-\n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 65 of 89\nrisk surgery.  A benign growth has been discovered in his  lung,  which he \nattributes to scar tissue from a  gunshot wound.  He  continues  to feel pain \nin his left arm and torso.

Because  a  number  of  militant  inmates  were \nprepared to  do  harm  to  the  hostages,  Frank  ''Black\"  Smith,  in \nconjunction with the Muslim  leadership,  implemented a  plan to \nsecure  the  safety of  the  hostages  during  negotiations. \nThis  view  was  corroborated  by  Michael  Smith,  age  51,  a \nformer  corrections  officer  who  was  a  hostage  up  to \nSeptember 13,  1971.  He  testified that he was  taken hostage on \nSeptember  9,  1971  by  a  group  of  inmates  who  were  out  of \ncontrol .  He  described them  as  a  ''wave  of  human  emotion.\"  He \nwas  in  charge  of  the  sheet  metal  shop  and  developed  a  good \nrapport  with  the  inmates  who  worked  under  him  and  they \nprotected him from the militant group.  But  eventually he came \nunder  the control  of  the take-over group and found himself  in \nthe  center of D-Yard  with other hostages.  One  of  the  inmates \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 78 of 89\nproved to be his  life saver.  The  inmate was  Don Noble whom he \nhad befriended and who  worked  in the  sheet metal  shop.  Noble \nprotected  him  on  September  9,  1971  and  would  later save  his \nlife on  September  13,  1971. \nMr.  Smith  was  interviewed  by  the  media  while  being  held \nhostage  along  with  Corrections  Officer  Cunningham.  He \nconveyed  what  the  inmates'  demands  were  for  improved \nconditions  and  reported that he was  not being harmed.  He  was \nblindfolded  most  of  the  time.  Upon  receiving  news  of \nCorrections  Officer  Quinn1 S  death,  the  negotiation  process \nbroke  down  and  a  different  \"mood11  set  in. \nOn  Sunday  night,  September  12,  1971,  the  feeling  was \n\"somber. 11  He  got  a  pen and wrote  a  good-bye  note to his wife \nand  family  on  dollar  bills  which  were  in  his  wallet.  He \ntestified  that  the  hostages  sat  in  a  circle  and  leaned  up \nagainst  each  other  for  support. \nOn  Monday,  September  13,  1971,  he  was  selected,  along \nwith a  few other hostages to be taken up on the A-Yard catwalk \nand a  hostage execution was  arranged.  He  was  taken to the top \nof  the  catwalk  by  three  inmates  and  sat  on  a  chair \nblindfolded.  Inmate  Don  Noble  was  on  his  left  and  held  a \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 79 of 89\nknife to his throat.  As  the Army helicopter hovered over them \nand  dropped  tear gas,  the  shooting  started and  the  inmate  on \nhis  right  was  shot  twice  and  blown  over  the  railing  of  the \ncatwalk.  Don  Noble  pulled  him  to  his  left  and  the  inmate \nimmediately  behind  him  received  a  fatal  volley  of  gunfire. \nNoble  was  shot  and  Michael  Smith  was  shot  four  times  in the \nstomach  and  once  in the  arm.  The  chair on  which  he  had  been \nsitting  disintegrated  from  gunshots.  Mr.  Smith  told  the \nCourt,  \"I  don't know how long the shooting went on.  You  could \nhear people  crying/  people  dying,  and  people  screaming.\" \nHe  never  lost  consciousness  as  he  laid  on  the  catwalk \nuntil a  trooper stood over him pointing a  shotgun at his head. \nHe  was  certain that he was  going to be killed.  A corrections \nofficer saw what  was  going  on  and yelled to the  trooper,  \"he \nis  one  of  us\"  and  then  the  trooper  focused  his  attention  on \nDon  Noble  who  was  still alive.  Michael  Smith  yelled  to  the \ntrooper,  \"he  saved my  life\"  and  the  trooper  spared Noble . \nHe  was  eventually  taken  by  National  Guard  medics  to \nSt.  Jerome's  Hospital  in Batavia  for  an  extensive  period  of \ntreatment  involving  multiple  surgeries.  He  was  eventually \nreleased from  service as  a  corrections  officer because  of his \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 80 of 89\nphysical inability to perform his duties.  He  commented on the \ninaccuracy of  the McKay Report  which claimed that he had been \nmerely  knocked  unconscious  - no  mention  of  his  extensive \ngunshot  wounds  nor  how  they were  obtained.  He  openly  stated \nthat  his  life was  saved while  he  was  held hostage  because  of \nthe  dedicated  efforts  of  the  Muslim  group  at  Attica.  \"In \nfact,  I  can  recall  hearing  one  of  the  Muslim  leaders \ninstructing  one  of  their  men  that  if  anyone  tries  to  break \nthrough  their  [Muslim]  perimeter  to  kill  them  or  die \nprotecting  the hostages.\" \nI  found  Mr.  Smith  to  be  totally  credible  and  he \ncorroborated testimony given by the former Muslim inmates who \nclaimed  they  were  given  unwarranted  \"special  treatment\" \nbecause  they  were  labeled  as  \"leaders\"  when,  in  fact,  they \nwere  protectors. \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 81 of 89\nUNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT \nWESTERN  DISTRICT  OF  NEW  YORK \nAKIL  AL-JUNDI,  on  behalf  of \nhimself  and all others  similarly \nsituated, \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  75-CV-132 \nVINCENT  MANCUSI,  et al, \nDefendants. \nJohn Kabel of Swannanoa,  North Carolina being duly sworn, \ndeposes  and says: \nThat  he  was  an  Emergency  Medical  Technician  (EMT)  from \nSt.  Jerome's Hospital,  Batavia,  New  York and was  present  at Attica \nfrom September 9,  1971  through September 13,  1971.  He,  along with \nother  ambulance  personnel  and  medical  technicians,  provided \nemergency medical  treatment  for  the  injured on September 13,  1971, \nthe date of the retaking.  His orders were to give  treatment  first \nto wounded guards or troopers while wounded or injured inmates were \nleft  unattended.  He  had  been  advised  the  day  before,  Sunday, \nSeptember  12th,  that  the  retaking  would  take  place on  the  morning \nof September 13th and was  given orders  on the priority of  treatment \nand care.  He  was present in D-Yard on the morning of September 13, \n1971  when  tear  gas  was  dropped  by  helicopter  and  the  shooting \nstarted.  He  saw  inmates  being  shot  \"all  over  the  place.\"  While \ntreating a  trooper  for  a  gunshot  wound  in  the  leg,  a  black  inmate \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 82 of 89\nlying on the ground nearby kept asking for assistance.  He was  told \nby  another  trooper  to  be  quiet  that  \"we  are  in  charge  now. 11  The \ninmate  persisted  in  asking  for  assistance  and  Mr.  Kabel  saw  a \ntrooper shoot him a  number of times  in the head with a  handgun.  He \nis unable to identify either the trooper or the inmate.  Only after \nall the guards and other personnel received medical treatment,  were \nthey then permitted to treat wounded  inmates.  He  saw  inmate Frank \nSmith lying on  a  picnic table with a  football  under  his  chin.  He \nsaw  a  guard  with  a  pistol  pointed  at  Smith's  head  threatening  to \nkill  him  if  the  football  fell  away.  He  saw  guards  dropping \nspitballs on Smith and taunting him with threats and racial  slurs. \nHe  saw inmates going through the gauntlet receiving severe beatings \non  their way  to  their cells. \nInmates  who  had  been  shot  and  eventually  died,  either  died \ninstantly or lingered  for  hours  unattended eventually bleeding  to \ndeath. \nZl \nJohn  Kabel  ---=::::: \nSworn  to  before me \nJk \nthis  day of \nAu  2000 \n( \n~t·~~ \nf \njl·:; f'·dm \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 83 of 89\nJames  W.  Nicholson \nJames Nicholson,  age  60,  of Medina,  New York testified on \nJune  21,  2000  and related events  from his vantage point  as  an \ninmate  in  C-Block  on  the  morning  of  September  13,  1971. \nAlthough  he  was  injured  on  September  9,  1971,  he  was  not \nqualified to  share  in  the  settlement  since he  is not  a  class \nmember.  (He  was  not  in D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971. ) \nPrison  records  do  not  reflect  that  Mr.  Nicholson  was \npresent  in D-Yard.  He also testified during the 1991  trial in \nthis litigation,  admitting that he was  not present in the Yard \non September 13,  1971.  He  was  consistent  in that view when he \noffered corroborating testimony in these proceedings.  He does \nnot  share  in  the  settlement  proceeds  and  fully  understands \nwhy. \nHis  testimony  is  helpful  because  he  was  a  former \nSheriff' s  Deputy  from  Niagara  County  and  saw  many  of  his \nformer  fellow  officers preparing  themselves  to. take back  the \nprison on  the morning  of  September 13,  1971.  He  saw  troopers \nclimb to the roof of C-Block using ladders .  Each was  equipped \nwith  a  3 0  caliber  rifle  with  telescopic  lens.  There  were \napproximately a  dozen of  them  and they were  the  sharpshooters \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 84 of 89\nassigned positions  on  top  of  C-Block.  They  had  a  clear shot \nat  the  hostages  lined  up  on  the  catwalk  of  A-Block  and \nelsewhere.  He  was  very  emotional  in describing  the  shooting \nthat  took place and how  \"unnecessary it was.\"  He  had trained \nofficers  in  riot  control  as  a  Sheriff's  Deputy  and  was  a \nformer  Marine  MP  and  felt  that  there  was  no  need  to  use \nbullets .  Tear  gas  would  have  been  sufficient  to  subdue  the \ninmates. \nAfter  the  shooting  subsided,  he  had  a  clear view  of  the \ncourtyard outside  the  infirmary and  saw  the  inmates  lying  on \nstretchers waiting their turn for  treatment.  \"It seemed  like \nthey  laid  there  for  hours\"  and,  indeed,  they  did.  His \ntestimony  corroborates  the  testimony  of  other  witnesses \nconcerning  the  length  of  time  it  took  to  receive  medical \ntreatment  for  those  who  were  seriously  injured. \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 85 of 89\nGene  Hitchens \nGene Anthony Hitchens of Miami,  Florida was  a  22-year old \ninmate  at  Attica  on  September  13,  1971  whose  claim  was \ndisallowed because he was  not physically present  in D-Yard on \nthat  date.  He  knew  in advance  of  his  testimony  that  he  did \nnot  qualify  to  share  in  the  settlement,  yet,  at  his  own \nexpense,  he  traveled  from  Miami  to  testify.  Although he  was \notherwise injured,  he  did not  fit the definition set  forth  in \nthe  terms  of  the  settlement  requiring  that claims  could only \nbe  honored  for  those  who  were  class  members  as  defined  in a \nprevious  Order of the Court  in 1979  as  those  inmates who  were \npresent in D-Yard on September 13,  1971.  But his testimony is \notherwise  relevant  in explaining  the  individual  tragedy  that \nbefell  the  inmates  starting on  September  9,  1971  through  the \nretaking on September  13,  1971  and  thereafter. \nMr.  Hitchens was  housed in cell block \"C\"  and assigned to \nthe  hospital  staff  as  a  hospital  worker  and  as  the  C-Block \nrunner.  As  a  hospital  worker,  he  was  responsible  for  the \nintake  and  discharge  processing  of  inmates  at  the  prison and \nfor  assisting  the  prison  physician  with  the  Monday  through \nFriday  sick call. \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 86 of 89\nOn  September  9,  1971  at  approximately  9:00a.m.,  he  was \ndelivering unit mail  to the A-Block side of what  was  commonly \nknown  to  the  inmate  population  as  Times  Square.  As  he  was \nreturning  from  a  trip to  the  control  center  desk  at A-Block, \nhe  was  ordered  held  by  one  of  the  Times  Square  corrections \nofficers  on  duty  who  was  the  first  to  see  a  large  crowd \nrunning  through  the  hallway.  Almost  halfway  down  the  long \nbreezeway leading to Times  Square,  he  could see a  large group \nof  inmates  running  towards  him  and  the  corrections  officers \npulled him  in front  of  them  as  they rushed  through  the  Times \nSquare  gate  and  had  it locked.  It turns  out  he  was  the  only \ninmate  with  three  corrections  officers  who  made  it past  the \nTimes  Square  checkpoint  seconds  before  the  large  crowd  of \ninmates  arrived. \nHe  saw the officers assigned to Times  Square being rushed \nand  they were  all being overcome  by a  large number  of  inmates \nwho  were  dressed  in athletic gear  carrying  baseball  bats  and \nbrandishing  other menacing  objects.  In  that  instant,  he  was \nno  longer  the  trusted  messenger  who  carried  confidential \ninformation  for  Attica  personnel.  Nor  was  he  remembered  as \nthe  trusted hospital  worker  assisting  inmates  and  physicians \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 87 of 89\nat sick call.  In that instant,  like so many others,  he became \na  target  for  hatred  and  abuse.  He  was  struck  over  his \nshoulder  and  back  by  corrections  officers  with  a  club  and \ndragged  to  a  cell  in C-Block.  Confused,  he  kept  asking  the \nofficer,  \"What  did I  do?  Why  are you  treating me  this way?\" \nFrom  his  cell  he  was  able  to  look  directly  into D-Yard. \nHe  was  ~ulled from  his  cell  on  a  number  of  occasions  and  was \ntold  that  he  would  be  punished  severely for  Officer  Quinn's \ndeath because  \"you were in the exact location of his post when \nall  the  shit  started.\"  He  was  also  accused  of  carrying \nmessages  and helping  the  coordination of  the  inmate  uprising \nand  for  the plans  of  escape  and movement  by  the  inmates.  He \nwas  threatened with severe punishment  in solitary confinement \nif  he  did  not  confess  to  his  role  to  alert  the  rest  of  the \nprison to  the  time  and  date  of  the uprising. \nWhen  the  retaking was  ordered on September 13,  1971,  two \ncorrections  officers  arrived  at  his  cell,  slammed  his  face \nagainst  the  window  bars,  and  ordered  him  to  watch  \"and  see \nwhat  happens  to fucking convicts who didn't obey the rules and \ntry to run  something.\"  He  saw  some  of  the  inmates being shot \nin spite of  the fact  that they were  waving  their hands  high in \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 88 of 89\nthe  air  and  begging  that  their  lives  be  spared.  From  his \ncell,  he  was  forced  to  watch  it all  unfold  in  front  of  him, \nhelpless .  It is that memory  that  has  tortured him  all  these \nyears. \nHe  had  this  to  say  during  his  testimony  about  Officer \nQuinn  - who  eventually  died  from  head  wounds  inflicted  by \ninmates  who  struck him  on  the  head on  September  9,  1971. \nAnd  I  want  to  say  if  anybody  associated \nwith Officer Quinn  is  in this courtroom,  I \nam  so terribly sorry that that man lost his \nlife. \nI've never been in a  position to tell that, \nto  say  that  to  anybody  that  it would  have \nmade  a  difference  to. \nBut  that  man  looked  after  me.  He  looked \nafter  me  and  I  felt  safe  because  of  him, \nand  I  guess  I  was  able  to  hold  on  to  my \nhumanity  because of  his  concern  for  me. \nMr.  Hitchens was  an  impressive witness.  He  is currently \nan associate  in a  program sponsored by the Kellogg  Foundation \nin Miami,  Florida as an outreach program to help children from \ndiverse  backgrounds  take  a  positive  path  with  their  lives. \nMr.  Hitchens  accepted the fact  that he  could not  share  in the \nsettlement fund but wanted the opportunity to testify to state \npublicly  his  relationship  with  Officer  Quinn  and  how \n\nCase 1:75-cv-00132-MAT-JWF   Document 755-2   Filed 08/28/00   Page 89 of 89\nunnecessary the suffering and carnage was.  His testimony gave \nmuch  insight to this Court in describing the atmosphere of  the \nperiod from  the start of  the uprising on September  9th  through \nthe  retaking  on  September  13th  and  highlighting  the  fact  that \nthere were many victims of the Attica episode  - not only those \nwho  unfortunately were  in D-Yard  on  September  13,  1971. \nI'm leaving Attica here  today,  your  Honor. \nThis  is where  Attica  ends  for me.  I'm not \ndragging  it.  I  don't  want  to  talk  about \nit .  I  don't  want  to  live  it again. ",

Upon review, this Court finds that it did properly charge \nthe jury in accordance with the applicable law. The Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, as made \nAttorneys and Law Firms \napplicable  to  state  officials  via  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment thereto, prohibits the infliction of “cruel and \nElizabeth M. Fink, Brooklyn, NY, Michael E. Deutsch, \nunusual punishments.” Estelle v.

The claims therein against prison  emergency and non-emergency situations and erroneously \ndoctors  were  dismissed  because  any  insufficiency  of  referred to the deliberate indifference standard. \nmedical  treatment  amounted,  at  most,  to  medical    \nmalpractice—viz., negligence.

Professional Golfers Ass’n, 85 F.R.D. 552, 566 (N.D.Ga.1979), it is suggested that Fed.R.Civ.P. rule 26(c) \n  protection against “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” might be liberally \ngranted to one not a party to a particular claim, in view of the “party” limitations of Fed.R.Civ.P. rules 33(a), 34(a) \nand 36(a). The court in Naismith declined to extend such protection because the movant had not alleged rule 26(c) \ngrounds for protection in addition to its “party” limitation objections. However, it is clear that the party limitation is \nitself sufficient to support objection under rule 36(a), even absent rule 26(c) grounds. The Advisory Committee notes \non the 1970 amendment to rule 36(a), deleting specified grounds for objections, observed: \n“The existing language describing the available grounds for objection to a request for \nadmission is eliminated as neither necessary nor helpful. The statement that objection may \nbe made to any request which is ‘improper’ adds nothing to the provisions that the party \nserve an answer or objection addressed to each matter and that he state his reasons for \nany objection. None of the other discovery rules sets forth grounds for objection, except so \nfar as all are subject to the general provisions of Rule 26.” \nThis language clearly implies that objections based on the scope of rule 36, including its limitation to parties, are \ncognizable. Considering the ordinary signification of “admissions”-that they are admissible evidence against \nparties opponent-I find defendant Mancusi’s objection well-taken, notwithstanding the contrary analysis in \nNaismith. \n \n2  Conflicting views on this issue were resolved by a 1970 amendment, adding the quoted language.

However,   \n2 \n \n\n \n \nAl-Jundi v. Oswald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1996)   \n \n \nFootnotes \n \n1  The jury was unable to reach unanimity as to the liability of either or both of the other two “reprisal” defendants. \n \n \n2  Some did. For example, one Gilberto Gonzalez was the beneficiary of a Court of Claims judgment in the amount of \n  $143,313, Willie Fuller’s estate $73,702, Donald McCoy $96,720, Peter C. Tarallo’s estate $165,596, Paul K. Kerber’s \nestate $69,445, Melvin DuVall Gray’s estate $822,307, Willie West, Jr.’s estate $1,021,987, James Miles’s estate \n$104,364. There is reliable information to the effect that others of the plaintiff class—and even some of the \nrepresentative plaintiffs—took their causes to the state court. \n \n3  It is pertinent to observe, however, that the bulk of the preparatory work for the retrial of the retaking facet of the \n  case has been done and need not be duplicated. The issues were tried once, albeit to a hung-jury mistrial, and the \nevidence should be repetitive. This is not to minimize the time needed to put all the minutiae back on an organized \nschedule but much less preparatory time should be needed. The trial itself should be of shorter duration than was \nthe earlier full trial although, admittedly, it must consume three or four weeks. \nAs for the trials for reprisal damages—which will follow if the new jury should find for the defendant—plaintiffs’ \ncounsel was prepared to go to trial this past June on behalf of twelve individual members of the class. Again, the \nbulk of the preparatory work need not be repeated. \nIf the new jury finds that there were constitutional transgressions in the planning and/or carrying out of the \nretaking, the earlier-contemplated twelve reprisal-damage trials will be aborted and this court and the attorneys \nfor the responsible defendants will have to go forward on a sequence of myriad trials of individuals’ damages. In \nthat context, however, there will be a justification for another award of interim fees and in a substantial amount. \nAt that point, if reached, the plaintiffs would have achieved another and more significant interim goal—i.e., the \nestablishment of responsibility for damages inflicted by the retaking. \n \n4  This Court has indicated that it probably would act favorably on a motion by Pfeil for an interim certification but \n  such has not been brought; the expectancy is that an appeal will be taken after a jury or juries have reached \ndecisions as to individuals’ damages. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n3 \n ",

Dorsey, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by \n  designation. \n \n1  The verdict sheet also contained questions, identical in form to the foregoing, as to the occurrence of constitutional \n  violations and defendant Pfeil’s liability with respect to the period after plaintiffs had been relocked in their cells. \n \n2  The jury also answered “yes” as to Pfeil’s liability for the period after plaintiffs had been locked into their cells. \n \n \n3  The jury failed to reach verdicts as to defendants Oswald or Mancusi on the failure-to-prevent-reprisals count on \n  which it found Pfeil liable. No defendant was found liable on any other count. On the “failure to provide adequate \nmedical care following the retaking” claim against Oswald, the jury found an Eighth amendment violation but did \nnot hold Oswald responsible. \n \n4  Appellant also argues that the jury instructions on the subjective component of Eighth Amendment liability \n  erroneously distinguished between riot and non-riot circumstances. This distinction was suggested by the decision \nin Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986), where the Court focused on the particular \nproblems presented by a prison disturbance. See id. at 320, 106 S.Ct. 1078 (“Where a prison security measure is \nundertaken to resolve a disturbance,” the question turns on whether force was applied in good faith or “maliciously \nand sadistically.”). In Hudson, the Court eliminated any distinction between “riot” and “normal” circumstances for \nthe purposes of evaluating excessive force claims, even as it denied that its holding effected any change in its Eighth \nAmendment jurisprudence. See Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6–7, 112 S.Ct. 995 (tracing standard to Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d \n1028 (2d Cir.1973)). In essence, the Court declared in Hudson that the necessary mens rea for excessive force claims \nwas fixed, but the amount of force that might reasonably have been necessary remains a function of the \ncircumstances. It is for this reason that the Court denied it was working an innovation in its jurisprudence—the \nriot/non-riot distinction was rejected because the identical inquiry is made when a jury evaluates whether a \nparticular use of force was excessive under the circumstances (with appropriate deference). See id. at 5, 112 S.Ct. \n995 (“What is necessary to establish an ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ ... varies according to the nature \nof the alleged constitutional violation.”). To be sure, the district court’s statement in the instant matter of the \nproper Eighth Amendment standard was imperfect—although it plausibly interpreted Whitley, it failed to anticipate \nHudson, which was decided shortly after the liability-phase trial went to the jury. The charge was harmless, \nhowever, because “reprisals,” as defined, are by definition not in good faith. \n14 \n \n\n \n \nBlyden v. Mancusi, 186 F.3d 252 (1999)   \n \n \n \n5  To be sure, where a supervisor’s liability is predicated on his role in planning the use of force, the appropriate \n  inquiry is that articulated in Hudson. See Al–Jundi, 926 F.2d at 238–39 (granting qualified immunity on claim against \nOswald for his role in plan to retake prison (applying Whitley standard)). No such claim is made against Pfeil, \nhowever. \n \n6  We note that the jury was instructed that it could find Pfeil liable if he, inter alia, “personally engaged in any such \n  reprisals.” While this is, of course, a basis for Eighth Amendment liability, it is anything but clear that plaintiffs \nadduced any evidence to support such a theory. \n \n7  Plaintiffs appear to have been content with the verdict sheet. On its face, however, all that could have been \n  established with finality by a verdict was the non-liability of particular defendants to all members of the class. \n \n8  Meriwether v. Coughlin, 879 F.2d 1037 (2d Cir.1989), was brought as a class action but involved a single trial on \n  liability and damages, and individual verdicts, resembling consolidated rather than class proceedings. \n \n9  This is not a settlement-only class, the case has been vigorously contested, and it does not involve “inventory” \n  plaintiffs. See Amchem, 117 S.Ct. at 2247–48. Further, no plaintiffs are objecting, and there has not been a \nreverse-auction or other coercive settlement. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.
