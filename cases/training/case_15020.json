    "summary": "<p>On February 3, 2015, minors in the custody of the Arizona foster care system filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the Arizona Department of Child Safety, the Arizona Department of Health Services, and the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396). The plaintiffs, represented by Children&rsquo;s Rights, Inc., the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest, and private counsel, sought class certification and both declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated their First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and provisions of the Medicaid Act. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that certain child welfare policies and practices exposed them to physical and emotional harm and unreasonable risk of harm while in the State&rsquo;s care.</p>\r\n<p>Over the preceding several years, Arizona had experienced a dramatic increase in the number of children in state foster care, with that population nearly doubling from 2003 to 2012. The plaintiffs alleged that this growth had been fueled by extensive state budget cuts to important support services that had previously helped keep families together. The plaintiffs alleged that these cuts resulted in problematic policies and institutional issues in Arizona, including: a severe shortage of physical, mental, and behavioral health services available to children in state care; a widespread failure to conduct timely investigations of reports that children had been maltreated while in state custody; and severe and sustained shortage of family foster homes. Allegedly, there was also a widespread failure to engage in basic child welfare practices aimed at maintaining family relationships, such as placing siblings together, placing children with their biological parents on a trial reunification basis, coordinating visits between children and their biological families, and having caseworkers make regular visits with the children&rsquo;s biological parents to monitor progress toward family reunification. Due to these problems, children were frequently placed far from their home communities, were forced to change schools, were separated from their siblings, and did not receive the mental and physical health care that they required.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2015, Judge Roslyn O. Silver denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to abstain and dismiss due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument that the <em>Younger </em>doctrine required abstention in this case because the injunctive relief sought would interfere with the state juvenile court&rsquo;s ability to perform its judicial functions and because the case was related to ongoing proceedings in juvenile court which were quasi-criminal in nature. The court found that the plaintiffs&rsquo; requested relief would &ldquo;not involve or interfere with the interest of the state in enforcing the orders and judgments of state courts&rdquo; and that the ongoing dependency proceedings at issue were not for the purpose of enforcing criminal laws. The court also rejected the defendants&rsquo; invocation of O&rsquo;Shea abstention, which prohibits a federal court from issuing an injunction which &ldquo;would result in an ongoing federal audit of state court proceedings.&rdquo; Finally, the court disagreed with the defendants&rsquo; assertion that <em>Pullman </em>abstention was appropriate, because the plaintiffs had not raised state law claims and the defendants had not presented any state law basis under which the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional claims might be resolved. 156 F. Supp. 3d 1024.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2016, the court ordered that one of the three next friends (in this case, a person representing a minor unable to maintain a lawsuit on his or her own behalf) be dismissed because they were ineligible to be a next friend. 2016 WL 8200450.</p>\r\n<p>After two years of continuous discovery disputes and scheduling delays, Judge Roslyn O. Silver granted class certification for the plaintiffs on September 30, 2017. The class was defined in three parts as:</p>\r\n<p>\"General Class: All children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCS due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect. Non-Kinship Subclass: All members in the General Class who are not placed in the care of an adult relative or person who has a significant relationship with the child. Medicaid Subclass: All members of the General Class who are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services under the federal Medicaid statute.\"</p>\r\n<p>The defendants petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal class certification, which was granted by the appellate court on December 19, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>On January 3, 2018, the defendants moved to stay further action in the case while the class action appeal was decided by the Ninth Circuit. The defendants argued that the district court proceedings should be stayed because discovery for the class action was time-intensive and expensive, and the deadlines for dispositive motions in the district court conflicted with deadlines in the court of appeals. The plaintiffs argued that an indefinite stay would cause irreparable harm to children in foster care.</p>\r\n<p>On February 13, 2018, Judge Silver denied without prejudice the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits. However, on February 27, 2018, the Ninth Circuit granted a motion to stay pending their decision on class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On June 4, 2018, one of the plaintiffs filed a handwritten motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint, requesting the certification of an additional subclass called &ldquo;Plaintiffs with Mental Illnesses,&rdquo; of which he would be a member. Judge Silver denied this motion on September 24, 2018, since a class certification appeal was still pending before the Ninth Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit released its decision on April 26, 2019, affirming two of the certified subclasses and vacating and remanding one. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the General Class and the Non-Kinship Subclass, but vacated and remanded the Medicaid Subclass, finding that the district court failed to make a finding that each member of the class was subject to identical future significant risk of Medicaid violations that would support injunctive relief. 922 F.3d 957.</p>\r\n<p>The parties agreed that the plaintiffs would recertify the Medicaid class and that additional discovery would be needed. On July 31, 2019, the plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for class recertification, and on August 9, 2019, Judge Silver ordered the defendants to pay the costs of additional discovery, which were projected to range from $135,000-$150,000.</p>\r\n<p>On October 11, 2019, Judge Silver granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to recertify the Medicaid subclass.</p>\r\n<p>After this final subclass was created, the defendants in the initial action filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on December 12, 2019. They contested the Ninth Circuit's decision to certify the class and most of the subclasses, stating that the classes, as written, did not have similar injuries across all members of the class. They contested the Ninth Circuit's decision in <em>Parsons v. Ryan</em>&mdash;the basis for upholding the classes at issue here&mdash;that certified a class with disparate injuries because the injuries were caused by the same statewide policy, and urged the Supreme Court to overturn it. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on March 20, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2020, the district court entered an order requiring the plaintiffs to file a motion to dismiss by August 11, 2020, if they intended to dismiss their third cause of action. The plaintiffs&rsquo; third cause of action alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; substantive due process rights by failing to provide timely investigations of reports that the class members had been maltreated while in state custody.</p>\r\n<p>Following extensive discovery, the parties began engaging in settlement talks in June 2020. After multiple negotiation sessions over the course of two months, the parties reached a settlement agreement. The agreement required the defendants to adopt new policies and practices to improve the following areas: 1) behavioral health, 2) physical and dental health, 3) case manager workload, and 4) placement array.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of the improvements to the behavioral health system, the defendants agreed to the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ensure that behavioral health services would be tailored to the child and family and provided in the most appropriate setting, in a timely fashion and in accordance with best practices, while respecting the child&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s cultural heritage;</li>\r\n<li>Provide children in out of home care access to a comprehensive array of behavioral health services, sufficient to ensure that they receive the treatment they need;</li>\r\n<li>Provide children in out of home care with behavioral health services from competent individuals who were adequately trained and supervised, provided in their home and community to the extent possible;</li>\r\n<li>Implement a quality assurance program;</li>\r\n<li>Review behavioral health cases to ensure that the particular needs of children in foster care were met;</li>\r\n<li>Improve its written policies with regard to Child and Family Teams, therapeutic foster care, and children transitioning from higher levels of care; and</li>\r\n<li>Meet specific outcome goals, including a compliance percentage of at least 80% over the course of three years.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In regards to physical and dental health, the defendants agreed to the the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improve tracking of comprehensive medical and dental examinations and other health care services;</li>\r\n<li>Develop and implement a training module for case managers to help them recognize potential developmental disabilities in children;</li>\r\n<li>Regularly measure and report the number and percentage of youth in out-of-home care who receive a comprehensive medical and dental exam, the number and percentage who receive a follow-up medical or dental service, the aggregate percentage of timely well-child examinations, the number and percentage of youth that receive immunizations; and</li>\r\n<li>Meet the specific outcome goal of at least 85% compliance for two consecutive years.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In terms of case manager workload, the defendants agreed to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Measure and monitor on a monthly basis the workload of case managers; and</li>\r\n<li>Perform practice improvement case reviews to monitor the quality of the services provided to children in out-of-home care.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regarding placement array, the defendants agreed to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improve caregiver selection by prioritizing placing children in family-like settings, monitoring caregiver availability, and implementing a standardized placement system;</li>\r\n<li>Develop, refine, and implement long term programs to reduce the use of congregate care;</li>\r\n<li>Employ a recruitment estimator model to identify foster family homes in order to meet the needs of children in out-of-home care;</li>\r\n<li>Measure and monitor on a monthly basis the number and percentage of various placement arrangements, including the rate that siblings were placed together, the rate that children were placed in their home communities, the number and percentages of children placed in congregate care; and</li>\r\n<li>Either reduce the utilization of congregate care to 10.5% or less and maintain that percentage for one year, or develop a practice improvement/corrective plan reasonably designed to achieve congregate care utilization of 10.5% and implement that plan for at least one year.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement also provided that the plaintiffs would continue to monitor the defendants for compliance, with the defendants&rsquo; agreeing to meet the requirements of the settlement by December 31, 2025. It also designated retired Arizona superior court judge Kenneth Fields as a mediator for potential disputes, and awarded attorneys&rsquo; fees to the plaintiffs in the amount of $6,500,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, 2020, the court granted the parties joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. Following the preliminary approval, the court received comments from more than 80 stakeholders, the majority of which were supportive of the agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 2021, the court approved the final settlement agreement and dismissed the case with prejudice. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.</p>",

Tinsley, et al. v. \nFaust, et al., CV-15-00185-PHX-ROS and is dated August 14, 2020, but it will not be \neffective until the date of final approval by the Court. This agreement is between \nDefendants Michael Faust, in his official capacity as director of the Arizona Department of \nChild Safety (โDCSโ), Defendant Jami Snyder in her official capacity as Director of the \nArizona Health Care Cost Containment System (โAHCCCSโ), (Faust and Snyder \ncollectively, โDefendantsโ), and Plaintiff B.K., through her next friend Margaret Tinsley, \nfor herself and those similarly situated. This agreement is conditioned on approval by the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona, as required by Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nRecitals \nPlaintiffs filed this action captioned B.K. ex rel. Tinsley, et al. v. Faust, et al., CV-15-00185-\nPHX-ROS on Feb. 3, 2015, alleging ongoing federal statutory and constitutional violations \nand seeking prospective declarative and injunctive relief concerning the Arizona child \nwelfare and Medicaid systems. The Court subsequently certified one General Class of all \nchildren who are or will be in the legal custody of the Arizona Department of Child Safety \ndue to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect, a Subclass of all children in the General \nClass who are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services \nunder the federal Medicaid statute, and a Subclass of children in the General Class who are \nnot placed in the care of an adult relative or person who has a significant relationship with \nthe child. \nDefendants deny Plaintiffsโ allegations in this action. \nThe Parties wish to amicably resolve this action in a way that addresses the concerns \nidentified in the action and benefits the children and families served by DCS. \nSettlement Provisions \nThe Parties agree as follows: \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 3 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material    To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \n1.  Behavioral Health \n1.1  Principles of the Behavioral Health System. The parties intend through this \nAgreement to further the following principles in the Childrenโs System of Care โ \nVision and Guiding Principles in AHCCCS AMPM Policy Ch. 100: \n(a)  Behavioral health services will be โtailored to the child and family and provided \nin the most appropriate setting, in a timely fashion and in accordance with best \npractices, while respecting the childโs familyโs cultural heritage.โ \n(b)  Consistent with the โ12 Arizona Principles,โ children in out of home care will \nhave โaccess to a comprehensive array of behavioral health services, sufficient to \nensure that they receive the treatment they need,โ and will receive behavioral \nhealth services from โcompetent individuals who are adequately trained and \nsupervised,โ โprovided in their home and community to the extent possible.โ \n1.2  Behavioral Health Quality Assurance Program  \n(a)  Quality Assurance Program. No later than the Integration Date, and \nconsistent with its contractual requirements and continuous improvement and \nsustainability strategy, DCS shall incorporate behavioral health performance \nmeasures as part of its comprehensive quality assurance program and DCS \nContinuous Improvement and Sustainability Strategy. DCS shall develop and \nimplement a scorecard to monitor and inform behavioral health care provided \npursuant to behavioral health service plans of children in out of home care. The \nscorecard will be designed to monitor capacity, process adherence, and outcomes \nin the following areas: (1) the extent to which children in out of home care \nreceive services identified in their behavioral health service plans, (2) the \ntimeliness of the service delivery; and (3) fidelity to the AHCCCS Child and \nFamily Team Practice Tool.  \n  \n(b)  CFT Performance Measures. No later than the Integration Date, and \nconsistent with its contractual requirements and continuous improvement and \nsustainability strategy, DCS shall develop and implement a scorecard to \nmonitor and inform fidelity to the CFT process. The scorecard will measure \nfidelity to the AHCCCS Child and Family Team Practice Tool, including the \nfrequency and timeliness of CFT meetings. As part of measuring and reporting \non fidelity to the CFT process, DCS shall require designated members of its staff \nand/or the contracted managed care organization or its contracted provider to \nperiodically attend a sample of CFT meetings and evaluate CFT practice, \nincluding compliance with the CFT policies DCS shall develop under section 1.4 \nof this agreement. DCS shall not be limited to the AHCCCS Child and Family \nTeam Practice Tool in its evaluation of CFT fidelity, and will develop written \ntraining material to instruct designees on use of any additional tools DCS \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 4 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material    To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \ndevelops for this purpose. \n \n(c)  TFC Performance Measures.  No later than the Integration Date, and \nconsistent with its contractual requirements and continuous improvement and \nsustainability strategy, DCS shall develop and implement a performance \nmeasure or measures to monitor and improve the utilization of therapeutic \nfoster care.  The measure or measures will include the number of DCS children \nin therapeutic foster homes; the number of licensed therapeutic foster homes \nand licensed and available beds; the number of children for whom TFC has been \nauthorized but who have not been placed in a TFC home, and the average \nduration from when the CFT recommended placement in a TFC home until the \nfirst day the child is placed in a TFC home. \n(d)  Monitoring Performance. DCS shall regularly conduct business reviews of \nthe performance measures developed under this section 1.2, and shall utilize the \ndata to continuously improve performance in each of the four Behavioral Health \nQuality Assurance areas. The Parties understand that delivery of services \nassessed using the Behavioral Health Quality Assurance Measures is dynamic \nand that measures and targets reported on scorecards will be improved, \nadjusted, or expanded as circumstances require.  \n1.3  Behavioral Health Case Review.   \n(a)  DCS, with support from its Managed Care Organization, and as part of its \nlarger Quality Management System, shall conduct the Behavioral Health \nClinical Chart Audit required in AHCCCS AMPM 940, and shall further \nenhance  the Clinical Chart Audit tool to account for the particular needs of \nchildren in foster care, including a determination of Yes, No, or Not Applicable \nto the following questions:  \n(1)  Whether the behavioral health assessments, evaluations, service plans, \nand CFTs for Class Members during the period under review were \nconducted in compliance with measurements as defined in the Clinical \nChart Audit tool. \n(2)  Whether the Class Members during the period under review received the \nservices identified in, and in the timeframe contemplated by, their \nbehavioral health service plans. \n(3)  Whether the behavioral health services received by Class Members during \nthe period under review were effective. In evaluating the effectiveness of \nbehavioral health services, the reviewer shall consider whether the \nservices adequately addressed crises; reduced placement disruptions and \nplacements in a more restrictive care setting; reduced symptoms; improved \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 5 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \neducational progress; promoted normal and natural childhood \ndevelopment; and other relevant factors.  \n(4) DCS shall annually compile the results of the audit in a written report\nthat includes the number and percentage of cases reviewed for which the\nanswers were Yes, No, or Not Applicable for each of the categories\nassessed. DCS shall utilize this information to develop its Practice/Quality\nImprovement plan for the following year.\n(5) DCSโs Behavioral Health Clinical Chart Audit shall include a sufficient\nnumber of cases to achieve a 90% confidence level with a 10% margin of\nerror, and shall include subpopulations of children: (i) children having\nhigh needs case managers; (ii) children not having a high needs case\nmanagers; and (iii) children who have been placed with multiple\ncaregivers.\n1.4  Behavioral Health Practice Improvements.

Settlement Agreement in 2001, the AHCCCS\nChild and Family Team Practice Tool, and Section 320 of the AHCCCS Medical\nPolicy Manual, DCS will enhance CFT policies to provide as follows:\n(1) A qualified behavioral health professional, as defined in AHCCCS AMPM\n310-B, must participate in the CFT process.\n(2) The CFT shall consider input from the qualified behavioral health\nprofessional(s) who participate(s) in the CFT, and shall develop a\nbehavioral health services plan that identifies the least restrictive setting\nwhere the childโs behavioral health needs can be met appropriately, and\nincludes the behavioral health services and support most likely to enable\nthe child to thrive in the least restrictive setting.\n(3) CFT facilitators shall be behavioral health providers with the specialized\ntraining and skill set to effectively implement the activities of the CFT\npractice model, as required in the AHCCCS CFT Practice Tool, and must\nbe present at the CFT meeting and lead the CFT;\n(4) The assigned DCS case manager or case managerโs supervisor must attend\nthe CFT meeting in person, by telephone, or electronically, and must be\n4 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 6 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \nknowledgeable about the child at the time of the CFT meeting; \n(5) Reasonably available relevant information about the child, including the\nchildโs behavioral health and medical history, must be provided to CFT\nmeeting participants; and\n(6) If the behavioral health services previously recommended by the CFT were\nnot provided as contemplated by the CFT, the CFT shall determine why\nnot, document efforts that were made to provide the services, and\ndetermine what corrective actions are necessary to ensure the service\ndelivery.\n(b) Therapeutic Foster Care.\n(1) TFC Policies. DCS shall refine and implement written policies relating to\ntherapeutic foster care that must:\n(i) Permit placement of a child in a therapeutic foster home in advance\nof any determination of medical necessity for purposes of Medicaid\nreimbursement when a TFC home meets the childโs needs.\n(ii) Absent a determination of medical necessity for the purpose of\nMedicaid reimbursement, permit a child to remain in a therapeutic\nfoster home as a DCS placement option when it is in the childโs best\ninterest and consistent with the childโs permanency plan.\n(2) TFC Training and Recruitment.  DCS shall update its written training\nand recruitment programs for therapeutic foster families. DCS may do so\ndirectly or indirectly through an agent, contractor, or third party acting\nunder DCSโs control. DCS shall (a) evaluate the skills required of\ntherapeutic foster parents; and (b) revise its recruitment strategy to\nensure sufficient capacity of adequately skilled therapeutic foster home\ncaregivers.\n(3) Mercer Findings and Recommendations.  DCS shall refine and\nimplement, by December 31, 2021, its work plan addressing the\nrecommendations made in the 2018 Mercer report (Therapeutic Foster\nCare /Home Care Training to Home Care Client: Analysis and\nRecommendations Report) to remove barriers to therapeutic foster care.\nThe work plan must include steps for further and ongoing evaluation of\nTFC โnetwork adequacyโ as recommended by Mercer.\n(c) Behavioral Health Services Array.\n(1) DCSโs Network Development Plan shall include a long-term plan for\ncreating and sustaining a network of qualified professionals sufficient to\n5 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 7 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \nassess and treat DCS children who have experienced trauma in varied \nways; resulting in multiple expressions of adaptive behaviors that often \nrequire clinical support and intervention to facilitate optimal functioning \nand long term success, and to provide other specialized services needed by \nchildren in foster care. \n(2) DCS shall work with the Managed Care Organization to develop and\nimplement a long-term plan to assess and build the capacity to provide\ncommunity-based behavioral health services to meet the needs of children\nin foster care.\n(d) Children Transitioning from Higher Levels of Care.

Workload\n3.1  Principles of Case Manager Workload. The parties acknowledge that the \nfundamental principles of monitoring case manager workload include the following \nand that the provisions in this article 3 are in furtherance of these principles:  \n(a) The role of the DCS case manager is critical to ensuring that children are placed\nappropriately; that they are safe; and that the children, their families, and their\ncaregivers receive the services they need for children to thrive.\n(b) Case manager workload must allow case managers sufficient time to do the\nfollowing for each child on their caseload: (1) engage productively with children,\nfamilies, and caregivers; (2) familiarize themselves with the relevant facts and\ncircumstances in their cases; (3) investigate allegations of abuse and neglect\nmade by the child; (4) attend meetings pertinent to case management; (5) ensure\nthe child promptly receives all the medical, dental, developmental, and\nbehavioral health services they need; (6) ensure visitation with parents and\nsiblings consistent with DCS policy; (7) achieve permanency with reasonable\npromptness; and (8) prepare for and attend court hearings.\n3.2  Workload Monitoring.

The case reviews will include the quality of visits by case \nmanagers of children in their placements and parents; the quality of visits between \nsiblings (if separated) and between children and their parents; and whether case \nmanagers are updating the childโs case file with updated behavioral health and \nphysical and dental health care information, including the health care services and \nneeds of the child. \n9 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 11 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \n4. Placement Array\n4.1  Placement Principles. The parties acknowledge that the fundamental principles of \nbuilding and maintaining an adequate placement array for children in out-of-home \ncare include the following and that the provisions in this article 4 are in furtherance \nof those principles: \n(a) The number of available family-like placements should be sufficient to ensure\nthat children can be placed in family settings that are safe, stable, nurturing\nenvironments until the childโs case plan goal is achieved. Children, particularly\nyoung children, are often best served by placement with a family.  Children\nshould be placed in the least restrictive settings. No child should be placed in a\ncongregate or group setting if their needs can be met in a family setting, merely\nbecause no appropriate family home is available.\n(b) The number of available family-like placements also should be sufficient for\nsiblings to be placed together when it is safe to do so and to facilitate\npreservation of a childโs connections to his or her own family and community.\nNo siblings should be separated or placed in congregate or group settings merely\nbecause no appropriate family home is available. No child should be placed far\nfrom home or family merely because no appropriate family home within the\nchildโs community is available.\n4.2  Caregiver Selection. \n(a) Placement in a Family Setting. DCS shall continue to develop, refine, and\nimplement processes to maximize its ability to place Non-Kinship Subclass\nmembers in a family-like setting as the preferred placement. By July 1, 2021,\nDCS shall have in place processes providing that, for placement decisions within\nDCSโs authority:\n(1) DCS shall place Non-Kinship Class Members in a family home in\ncircumstances where the family environment meets the childโs needs;\n(2) When a child is placed in any form of congregate care, the reasons for\ndoing so are documented. The documentation shall include (a) the reasons\nwhy the childโs needs are not best served in a family home or, alternatively\n(b) an indication that the child is being placed in congregate care because\nno appropriate family home is available.\n(3) When a child is placed in congregate care, DCS revisits at regular\nintervals the appropriateness and possibility of moving the child into a\nfamily-like setting;\n(4) A child who enters care within 60 days of a sibling be placed with that\nsibling if it is appropriate to do so; and\n10 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 12 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \n(5) When siblings in DCS care are not placed together, the reasons for not\ndoing so are to be reviewed in clinical supervision.\n(b) Placement Administration. DCSโs centralized placement administration unit\nwill continue to monitor caregiver availability. DCSโs scorecards and\nmanagement system shall measure and monitor on a monthly basis the data\nconcerning the placement of children in out-of-home care.\n(c) Placement Tool. By July 1, 2021, DCS shall develop (and/or enhance, if one\nalready exists) and implement a standardized Placement Tool to help\nstandardize placement decisions. The Placement Tool will identify a childโs most\nappropriate placement setting, regardless of placement availability. In\nparticular, the Placement Tool will facilitate the identification of children for\nwhom a family home would be the most appropriate placement but who are\nplaced in congregate care because no appropriate family home is available. The\nPlacement Tool will also take into account any relevant information in the\nchildโs behavioral health service plan or from the TDM; the policy of placing\nsiblings together if appropriate; and minimization of disruptions to a childโs\neducation, services, and relationships.\n4.3  Long-term Program to Reduce the Use of Congregate Care. DCS shall continue \nto develop, refine, and implement long term processes to reduce the use of congregate \ncare, to identify the resources necessary to place Non-Kinship Subclass members in \nfamily-like settings, and to obtain such resources. By July 1, 2021, DCS shall have in \nplace processes that must include: \n(a) A plan to identify and recruit potential foster parents with the desire and ability\nto care for children who DCS might otherwise place in congregate care, and to\nidentify and develop training and support for these families.\n(b) A plan to identify and recruit foster parents with the desire and ability to care\nfor historically challenging-to-place subpopulations of children, including but\nnot limited to teenagers, sibling groups of four or more children, medically\nfragile children, and LGBTQ+ Youth, as set forth in section 4.4. DCS also shall\nidentify and develop training and support for these families.\n(c) A plan to reduce the numbers and percentages of children placed in congregate\ncare, including a plan to reduce to as close to zero as feasible, the number of\nchildren who are placed in congregate care because an appropriate family home\nis not available.\n4.4  Foster Family Recruitment Estimator Model. DCS shall continue to employ a \nrecruitment estimator model to identify Foster Family Home recruitment targets by \nestimating the number of Foster Family Homes DCS must recruit to meet the needs \nof children in out-of-home care. The model must incorporate the goal of recruiting a \n11 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 13 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \nsurplus of Foster Family Homes to ensure the ability to match children to homes. The \nmodel should also generate recruitment targets for the number of Foster Family \nHomes needed to meet the particular needs of any subpopulations of children whom \nDCS might otherwise place in congregate care. And the model should generate \nrecruitment targets for the number of Foster Family Homes that will need to be \nrecruited to meet the need to place children in their home communities. \n4.5  Performance Measures. DCS shall measure and monitor on a monthly basis: \n(a) The number and percentage of congregate care Bed Days used for each type of\ncongregate care placement utilized by DCS.\n(b) The number and percentages of children placed in congregate care for each type\nof congregate care placement utilized by DCS (excluding BHRFs, BHIFs,\ninpatient psychiatric hospitals, and detention), and the time that children spend\nin such congregate care.\n(c) The number and percentages of children placed in congregate care because no\nappropriate family home is available.\n(d) The rate that siblings are placed together.\n(e) The rate that children are placed in their home communities.\n(f) The number of licensed foster homes to care for Non-Kinship Subclass Members,\nthe number of those homes licensed to care for sibling groups of four or more\nchildren, the number of those homes with licenses restricted to specific children,\nthe number of those homes with licenses restricted to respite care only, and the\nnumber of those homes that are not currently accepting foster children.\n(g) The extent to which DCS successfully met its recruitment targets as determined\nby the Recruitment Estimator and whether the assumptions underlying the\nRecruitment Estimator model were accurate.\n4.6  Placement Outcome. \n(a) DCS shall either:\n(1) Reduce the utilization of congregate care to 10.5% or less, and sustain a\nutilization average of 10.5% or less for 12 months thereafter, or\n(2) If DCS does not achieve and sustain such reduction by December 31, 2022,\nDCS may meet this outcome requirement by satisfying all of the following:\n(i) DCS shall develop a practice improvement/corrective action plan\nreasonably designed to achieve congregate care utilization of 10.5%\nand implement the action plan for at least 12 months, and\n12 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 14 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \n(ii) DCS shall achieve a decrease in the utilization of congregate care in\neach of three consecutive 12-month periods, for any three consecutive\n12-month periods following January 1, 2021.\n(b) Utilization will be measured by the total number of bed days that 0-17 year old\nchildren in out-of-home care spend in DCS licensed congregate care, divided by\nthe total number of bed days for all 0-17 year old children in out-of-home care.\n13 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 529-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 15 of 26\nConfidential Rule 408 Material  To be used for settlement purposes only \nAug. 26, 2020 \n5.

This is a civil rights class action brought by the Named Plaintiffs, children in \n5  Arizona state foster care custody, on behalf of themselves, a general class of children who \n6  are or will be placed in such custody following reports that they have suffered child abuse \n7  or neglect, and certain subclasses of these children. \n8  2.  Plaintiffs are among the Stateโs most vulnerable citizens.  Through no fault \n9  of their own, they find themselves in the legal custody of the State after having already \n10  suffered the trauma of being abused or neglected by their own families.  Plaintiffs seek \n11  declaratory and injunctive relief to end certain child welfare policies and practices \n12  described herein exposing them to yet further physical and emotional harm and \n13  unreasonable risk of harm while in the Stateโs care.   \n14  3.  On May 29, 2014, legislation was enacted giving responsibility for the \n15  stateโs child welfare operations to the state Department of Child Safety (โDCSโ) and \n16  removing such responsibility from the state Department of Economic Security (โDESโ).  \n17  As of May 29, 2014, DCS, which was established as an independent agency, is legally \n18  responsible for managing the stateโs child welfare system. \n19  4.  Plaintiffs name Charles Flanagan, the Director of DCS, as a defendant.  \n20  Defendant Flanagan, who is sued solely in his official capacity, directly and indirectly \n21  controls and is responsible for the policies and practices of DCS, including those set forth \n22  herein.   \n23  5.  Plaintiffs also name William Humble, the Director of the state Department of \n24  Health Services (โDHSโ), as a defendant.  DHS is responsible for providing mental and \n25  behavioral health services to children in Arizona state foster care custody.  Defendant \n26  Humble, who is sued solely in his official capacity, directly and indirectly controls and is \n27  responsible for the policies and practices of DHS, including those set forth herein.   \n28 \n2\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 3 of 51\n1  6.  Over the past several years, while foster care rates across the nation have \n2  been on the decline, Arizona has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of children \n3  in state foster care.  From 2003 to 2012, the number of children in the Stateโs foster care \n4  custody nearly doubled.  More recently, Arizonaโs foster care population grew from \n5  10,207 as of March 31, 2010 to 15,037 as of September 2013, a 47.3% increase.  The \n6  number of children in out-of-home care grew by another 10% from February 2013 to \n7  February 2014.  As of September 30, 2014, there are 16,990 children in state foster care \n8  custody who have been placed in out-of-home care.    \n9  7.  This huge growth in the stateโs foster care population has been fueled by \n10  extensive state budget cuts to important support services that had previously helped keep \n11  families together.  In particular, state funding for DESโs contracts with community-based \n12  providers who offered in-home services to children, aimed at making removal of children \n13  into foster care unnecessary, was cut in half in recent years, from $43 million in fiscal year \n14  2008 to under $22 million in fiscal year 2012.   \n15  8.  These cuts followed the stateโs termination of its Family Builders program in \n16  2004, which had provided family-centered assessments, case management, and services for \n17  families with children deemed to be at low or only potential risk of being abused or \n18  neglected.    \n19  9.  According to the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics \n20  โ[c]uts to DES family support services including child care assistance, housing assistance, \n21  substance-abuse treatment and job training for families has resulted in a 40% increase in \n22  the number of children who needed to be placed in foster care since 2009 and these \n23  children are staying in foster care longer because their parents are not provided with the \n24  services they need.โ \n25  10.  As former Governor Brewer publicly acknowledged in 2014, the Arizona \n26  โchild welfare system is broken, impeded by years of structural and operational failures.โ  \n27  Defendants DCS and DHS (collectively the โDefendantsโ) are legally responsible for \n28  overseeing this โbrokenโ system. \n3\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 4 of 51\n1  11.  Defendants are well aware that the following structural and operational \n2  failures continue to plague the stateโs child welfare system: \n3  โข  A severe shortage in and inaccessibility of physical, mental and \nbehavioral health services available to children in state care.  As a result, \n4  far too many children in state foster care custody do not receive the health \ncare services they desperately need and all children in state care are subject \n5 \nto an unreasonable risk that they will suffer physical and emotional harm and \ndeterioration while in the stateโs care.  \n6 \nโข  A widespread failure to conduct timely investigations of reports that \n7 \nchildren have been maltreated while in state foster care custody.  As a \nresult of the stateโs deficient investigation practices, children in state foster \n8 \ncare custody are placed at an undue risk of suffering physical and emotional \nharm while in state care.    \n9 \nโข  A severe and sustained shortage of family foster homes.  As a result of \n10 \nthis shortage, children in state foster care are emotionally harmed and \nsubjected to an unreasonable risk of harm by being placed far from their \n11 \nfamilies and communities, separated from their siblings, and forced to \nexperience disruptive school changes.    \n12 \nโข  A widespread failure to engage in basic child welfare practices aimed at \n13 \nmaintaining family relationships, such as placing siblings together, \nplacing children with their biological parents on a trial reunification \n14 \nbasis, coordinating visits between children in state foster care and their \nbiological families, and having caseworkers make regular visits with the \n15 \nchildrenโs biological parents to monitor progress toward family \n16  reunification.  These failures subject children in state foster care to an \nunreasonable risk of suffering emotional harm while in state care. Moreover, \n17  as a result of these deficiencies, children are subjected to unreasonable \ndelays in being reunified with their families, causing them to suffer further \n18  emotional harm. \n19  12.  The State has failed to remedy these ongoing failures.  \n20  13.  Moreover, Arizona officials have long been aware of these deficiencies and \n21  harms.  As far back as 2003, the Maricopa County Attorneyโs Office released a report on \n22  the stateโs child welfare system, In Harmโs Way, detailing the systemโs deficiencies.  \n23  Among its findings, the report identified a shortage of foster homes and stated that โ[p]art \n24  of the reason many feel that children stay in a โriskyโ situation is the inability to place them \n25  elsewhere.โ  The report concluded that the stateโs child welfare system was โoverloaded \n26  without the proper resources to ensure the safety of all children.โ \n27  14.  That same year, then Governor Janet Napolitano acknowledged that โ[t]he \n28  system for protecting Arizonaโs children from abuse and neglect, which has been falling \n4\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 5 of 51\n1  apart for years due to poor design and chronic under-funding, is in critical need of repair.โ  \n2  Governor Napolitano convened an โAdvisory Commission on CPS Reformโ that issued an \n3  Action Plan for Reform of Arizonaโs Child Protection System in September 2003 (the \n4  โAction Planโ).  The Action Plan noted several systemic deficiencies in the stateโs child \n5  welfare system, including a shortage of foster homes and limited access to services for \n6  foster children. \n7  15.  In the years since In Harmโs Way and the Action Plan were released, the \n8  child welfare system has continued to suffer from a vast shortage of foster homes and \n9  inadequate access to child services, despite the known harm that these structural \n10  impairments have caused children in state foster care to suffer.     \n11  16.  As a result of the stateโs failure to remedy these problems, plaintiffs have \n12  been, and continue to be, exposed to harm and an unreasonable risk of harm, in violation \n13  of their federal constitutional and statutory rights. \n14  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15  17.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress violations of \n16  the United States Constitution and the provisions of the federal Medicaid Act, including \n17  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and 1396d(r), that \n18  require states to provide early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment (โEPSDTโ) \n19  services.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and \n20  authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202.   \n21  18.  Venue is proper here pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because the claims \n22  arise in this district. \n23  PARTIES \n24  A.  The Named Plaintiffs \n25  B.K. \n26  19.  B.K. is a ten-year-old girl who has spent more than half of her life in state \n27  foster care.  Even though she is only ten, DCSโs permanency goal for her is permanent \n28  foster care, meaning that DCS has concluded that she has little, if any, chance of leaving \n5\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 6 of 51\n1  foster care over the next eight years.  During her time in state foster care, B.K. has been \n2  deprived of needed physical and mental health care, separated from her siblings, deprived \n3  of contact with her mother and siblings, and placed in institutional settings on two different \n4  occasions.  As a result of these experiences, B.K. has been subjected to emotional harm \n5  and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n6  20.  B.K. first entered voluntary state custody in 2005 when she was five months \n7  old.  At that time, B.K.โs mother had a substance abuse problem and could not care for her.  \n8  B.K. remained in the legal custody of the state until September 2006 when she was \n9  returned to her mother. \n10  21.  In 2008, then three-year-old B.K. and her three siblings were removed from \n11  their motherโs home.  Upon assuming their care, the state immediately separated the four \n12  siblings, placing B.K. and her brother in a licensed foster home, and their two sisters in a \n13  second foster home.  In late 2009, the state returned B.K. and her siblings to their motherโs \n14  care. \n15  22.  In 2012, B.K. and her three siblings were again removed from their motherโs \n16  home and placed in state foster care custody.  Upon coming into state care for the third \n17  time, B.K. was diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (โPTSDโ), a mood disorder, \n18  psychosis and anxiety.  An investigation showed that B.K. had been physically abused by \n19  her mother, and had bumps and bruises on her head and behind her ears.   \n20  23.  Despite her fragile emotional state, the state separated B.K. from all of her \n21  siblings, placing her in a group home on โemergency shelterโ status.  Though such \n22  placements are supposed to be short-term, B.K. remained at the group home for more than \n23  two years.   \n24  24.  While at the group home, the state failed to ensure that B.K. obtained the \n25  glasses she needed to see properly.  The state also failed to discover that B.K. was walking \n26  with a limp, and failed to make sure that she received the orthopedic shoes she needed.  \n27  Despite months of complaints from B.K. about a toothache, the state failed to make sure \n28  she saw a dentist while she was living at the group home.    \n6\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 7 of 51\n1  25.  From the time B.K. was placed at the group home in 2012 until early 2014, \n2  the state also failed to ensure that B.K. received consistent counseling and needed mental \n3  health services.  During this time, B.K. was saying that she was hearing voices that were \n4  telling her to hurt other people or that someone would die.  One time she was so scared by \n5  the voices that she called the police.  The state knew that the group home was failing to \n6  arrange for B.K.โs transportation to appointments with health care providers, but failed to \n7  see to it that B.K. received undisrupted services.  The group home also enrolled B.K. in a \n8  specialized school where she was the only girl. \n9  26.  In May 2014, the state finally placed B.K. in a foster home after she had \n10  spent 25 months in the group home.  The state placed her with a man and his great-nephew \n11  who went to the same specialized school as B.K.  The man told the state that he was \n12  concerned about B.K.โs mental health and asked the state to make sure she received an \n13  updated psychological evaluation.  The last complete evaluation had been conducted five \n14  years earlier when B.K. was four.  The updated assessment was never performed.  After \n15  only eight weeks, B.K. was moved to a second foster home with neighbors of the man and \n16  his great-nephew.  After two weeks at this second home, the foster parents packed up \n17  B.K.โs things and dropped her off at a DCS office. \n18  27.  In August 2014, DCS moved B.K. to a shelter.  The move to shelter care \n19  caused B.K. to have to change schools, resulting in educational and social disruption.  \n20  Moreover, the counselor who had been treating B.K. at the group home refused to drive to \n21  see B.K. at the shelter because of the distance involved, and DCS again failed to ensure \n22  that B.K. received transportation to her counseling sessions. \n23  28.  During August 2014, B.K.โs behavioral health coordinator concluded that \n24  B.K. should be placed in a โHome Care Training to Home Care Client Servicesโ \n25  (โHCTCโ) therapeutic foster home.  No such placement was made and B.K. remained in a \n26  shelter until September.  While at the shelter, B.K. had no contact with her mother or three \n27  older siblings, even though her siblings have been returned to their motherโs care.  B.K.โs \n28 \n7\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 8 of 51\n1  mental health deteriorated at the shelter and she threatened to hurt herself and others.  She \n2  was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a week to be stabilized.   \n3  29.  In late September 2014, DCS moved B.K. from the hospital to a non-\n4  therapeutic foster home.  This resulted in another change in schools.  DCS did not ensure \n5  that she had regular contact with her mother or siblings.  \n6  30.  In December 2014, still waiting to be placed in an HCTC home, B.K. had \n7  another psychiatric crisis and threatened suicide.  The state moved her out of the foster \n8  home and admitted her to another psychiatric hospital.  She stayed in the hospital for a \n9  week and a half.   \n10  31.  In late December, months after her providers agreed she needed a therapeutic \n11  foster home, B.K. was finally discharged from the hospital to an HCTC placement.  This \n12  resulted in yet another change in schools.     \n13  C.P.  \n14  32.  C.P. is a seven-year-old boy who has been in state foster care custody since \n15  June 2013.  His current permanency goal is adoption.  During his time in state care, he has \n16  attended eight different schools and has had to live in 11 different placements, including \n17  two stays in shelters and a placement in a foster home where he was physically abused.  \n18  While in state care, he has been separated from his siblings, deprived of visits with them, \n19  and has been deprived of access to both the mental health services and placements he \n20  desperately needs.  As a result of these experiences, C.P. has been subjected to physical \n21  and emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n22  33.  C.P. and his two sisters were taken into state custody after being exposed to \n23  neglect and domestic violence.  They were initially placed in an unlicensed foster home for \n24  four days before being moved to their grandmotherโs home.  During the two-month period \n25  that C.P. was with his grandmother, she repeatedly asked the state for help with C.P.โs \n26  mental health needs, but C.P. did not receive any mental health care services.  Ultimately, \n27  his grandmother asked the state to remove C.P. and his siblings from her home. \n28 \n8\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 9 of 51\n1  34.  The state then separated C.P. and his older sister from their younger sister. \n2  C.P. and his older sister were placed in a Spanish-speaking foster home, even though the \n3  children do not speak Spanish.  The home was almost an hour away from C.P.โs \n4  grandmother and the foster home where C.P.โs younger sister was placed.  Within ten days \n5  of arriving at the Spanish-speaking foster home, C.P. and his older sister were separated \n6  and placed in two different foster homes.   \n7  35.  In early September 2013, the state moved C.P. to yet another foster home.  \n8  After months in foster care, C.P. was belatedly assigned a therapist.  Even then, however, \n9  C.P.โs foster mother refused to take C.P. to his appointments  and the state failed to arrange \n10  for other transportation.  As a result, C.P. did not have a single therapy session during the \n11  four months he lived at the foster home.  \n12  36.  The foster mother was also reported to the state Child Abuse Hotline, to \n13  C.P.โs DES case manager and to the state licensing office, after she placed C.P. in the front \n14  seat of her car without a car seat or booster seat.  DCS did not conduct an investigation of \n15  these reports.  Moreover, the case manager acknowledged that she had made an earlier \n16  report to the Child Abuse Hotline herself when it was discovered that the foster mother had \n17  left C.P. unsupervised with another foster child.  DCS did not investigate that report either.  \n18  37.  In January 2014, C.P. began visiting at another home where his older sister \n19  was living.  When his foster mother failed to pick him up from a visit, the state simply told \n20  the family whom C.P. was visiting to keep him.  C.P. subsequently disclosed that his \n21  former foster mother had hit him with a spoon.  Though the state investigated the reported \n22  abuse, DCS never entered any investigation findings into the agencyโs Childrenโs \n23  Information Library and Data Source (โCHILDSโ) system, nor did the state close the \n24  investigation.  \n25  38.  C.P. started living at the new foster home with his older sister in January \n26  2014.  Shortly thereafter, he became suicidal.  Though he had a crisis stabilization team in \n27  place, it failed to promptly respond to this crisis, and the foster mother called the police \n28  who took C.P. to the hospital.  C.P. did not see his older sister again for nearly a year. \n9\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 10 of 51\n1  39.  C.P. was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a week.  He was diagnosed \n2  with PTSD and his doctors indicated that he needed immediate intensive trauma therapy \n3  and specialized therapy at a therapeutic HCTC home.  C.P.โs stabilization team agreed that \n4  C.P. needed to be placed in a foster home equipped to respond to his needs. Nevertheless, \n5  when C.P. left the hospital, the state took him directly to a shelter.  He spent ten days in \n6  that shelter before being moved to a second shelter, a move that also resulted in C.P. \n7  having to change schools.   \n8  40.  In February 2014, three weeks after arriving at the second shelter, C.P. \n9  became suicidal again, telling staff about his plan to get a knife and hurt himself.  He was \n10  hospitalized for a second time and prescribed psychotropic medication.  He remained in \n11  the hospital for two weeks before being discharged in March 2014.  Again, the doctors at \n12  the psychiatric hospital recommended that C.P. be released to a therapeutic HCTC home.   \n13  41.  Instead, the state placed C.P. in a non-therapeutic foster home.  C.P. had to \n14  switch schools again and was inappropriately placed in first grade instead of kindergarten, \n15  where he should have been enrolled based on his age and school experience.  He stayed in \n16  first grade for a month before anyone realized he was in the wrong grade.   \n17  42.  In April 2014, the state finally placed C.P. in an HCTC home.  \n18  Unfortunately, he was required to switch schools again as a result of this latest placement.  \n19  43.  In December 2014, both of C.P.โs two sisters were adopted.  During the year \n20  before they were adopted, C.P. had only one sibling visit with one of his sisters, even \n21  though his mental health assessments indicate that his sisters are the only people with \n22  whom he has meaningful attachments.  Moreover, he has had no contact with either of \n23  them since they were adopted.  Nor has C.P. received the intensive trauma therapy that was \n24  recommended for him in January 2014.  Because his HCTC placement is temporary, his \n25  providers have decided that he should not receive intensive trauma therapy until he is in a \n26  more stable home.   \n27 \n28 \n10\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 11 of 51\n1  B.T. \n2  44.  B.T. is a fourteen-year-old boy diagnosed with PTSD.  His current \n3  permanency goal is adoption.  During his many years in state foster care custody, he has \n4  been shuffled through numerous institutional settings despite his young age, separated \n5  from his siblings, denied sibling visitation, deprived of much needed mental health care, \n6  and has had to endure repeated educational disruptions.  As a result of these experiences, \n7  B.T. has been subjected to emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n8  45.  In January 2005, B.T. was taken into foster care for the first time, along with \n9  his two older brothers.  B.T. and one of his older brothers were placed together in a group \n10  home, and the other brother was separated and placed in a different group home.   \n11  46.  A month after being taken into state care, B.T. had a psychological \n12  evaluation, which indicated that he needed therapeutic treatment.  He had to wait six \n13  months before his first therapy session. \n14  47.  In June 2005, B.T. was removed from the group home and separated from \n15  the brother with whom he was placed there.  He was moved to a kinship foster home with \n16  a paternal aunt.  By December 2005, B.T. had spent six months in his new home without \n17  any visits with his older brothers.  He did not see his brothers again until January 2006. \n18  48.  In August 2006, B.T.โs aunt told the state that B.T. was not receiving the \n19  counseling that he needed.  She requested that B.T. have an updated psychological \n20  evaluation, but no such evaluation was conducted.  During this same time period, the state \n21  was again failing to provide B.T. with regular visits with one of his brothers. \n22  49.  In September 2006, B.T.โs aunt told the state that she could no longer care \n23  for B.T. since the state was not providing him with the mental health services he needed.  \n24  Rather than providing those services, the state moved B.T. to an emergency receiving \n25  foster home.   \n26  50.  In October 2006, B.T. threatened to kill himself and the foster family with \n27  whom he was temporarily placed.  Despite his mounting mental health issues, B.T. still \n28 \n11\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 12 of 51\n1  was not receiving regular therapy.  The state responded to this latest crisis by removing \n2  B.T. from the home.  B.T., then six years old, was again placed in a group home.   \n3  51.  Shortly thereafter, the state received reports that B.T. was struggling \n4  emotionally in the group home.  Again, an updated psychological evaluation for B.T. was \n5  requested, but the evaluation was not scheduled until December 2006.  The state also failed \n6  during this time to ensure that B.T. received needed counseling.  \n7  52.  B.T.โs evaluation indicated that he needed individual therapy every other \n8  week.  He was also prescribed psychotropic medication.  A psycho-educational evaluation \n9  was recommended, but never conducted. \n10  53.  In January 2008, B.T. was placed in a pre-adoptive home with one of his \n11  brothers.  A month later, the family told the state that B.T. needed more intensive \n12  counseling and a different counselor who could better meet B.T.โs needs.   \n13  54.  In August 2008, both B.T. and his brother were adopted.  In March 2011, \n14  however, they were both taken back into state foster care.  Shortly after this occurred, B.T. \n15  reported that his adoptive father had been beating him with a belt.   \n16  55.  The state immediately separated B.T. from his brother, placing the two boys \n17  in different non-therapeutic group homes.  The group home where B.T. was placed told the \n18  state that B.T. desperately needed counseling.  Despite this, B.T. did not receive any \n19  counseling while at the group home.   \n20  56.  A month after being brought back into state care, B.T. was hospitalized in an \n21  acute care mental health facility for two weeks.  After leaving the hospital, the state \n22  returned B.T. to the group home. \n23  57.  Once back at the group home in May 2011, B.T.โs mental health worsened.  \n24  The state approved B.T. for a therapeutic HCTC placement, but did not have one available \n25  for him.   \n26  58.  Stuck in the group home, B.T. responded by trying to run away.  B.T. spent \n27  the night at a juvenile detention center.  In that one night, his group home filled his open \n28 \n12\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 13 of 51\n1  bed with another child.  As a consequence, the state moved B.T. to a new group home \n2  hours away from his prior placement. \n3  59.  In July 2011, B.T. was moved to an HCTC home, but he was still not \n4  receiving trauma therapy and no psycho-sexual evaluation had been completed, despite \n5  one having been recommended months earlier.  It was not until October 2011 that a \n6  psycho-sexual evaluation was conducted.   \n7  60.  During April 2012, the state began looking for another HCTC placement to \n8  better meet B.T.โs needs.  Unable to find one, it instead moved him to a non-therapeutic \n9  group home/shelter in August 2012.  By October 2012, B.T. reported โI feel like I get \n10  tossed around like a bag of chips.โ  He threatened to kill himself three times while in this \n11  non-therapeutic congregate care placement.  \n12  61.  In November 2012, the shelter told the state that B.T. needed a higher level \n13  of care.  The next month he was moved again, this time to a therapeutic group home.  \n14  While placed there, B.T. continued to express suicidal thoughts.  \n15  62.  In January 2013, B.T. was returned to the same non-therapeutic group \n16  home/shelter that had told the state just two months earlier that B.T. needed a higher level \n17  of care.  B.T. remained at that shelter for a few more weeks before the state moved him \n18  again to a therapeutic group home two hours from his home community.  In May 2013, the \n19  brother with whom B.T. was adopted in 2008 was placed in a pre-adoptive placement with \n20  a family that ultimately adopted him.  B.T. felt defeated and said he thought he would \n21  never get out of the group home.  The following month, B.T. grabbed the steering wheel of \n22  a van driven by group home staff, saying, โI want us all to die.โ  That same day, the stateโs \n23  therapeutic team coordinating B.T.โs behavioral health services reported that โwith a few \n24  exceptions, B.T. is doing well over the last 2 weeks.โ \n25  63.  Following the apparent suicide attempt, B.T.โs treating psychiatrist \n26  recommended that B.T. be placed in a residential treatment facility.  An application was \n27  made the following month.  While that request was pending, the state moved B.T. to \n28 \n13\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 14 of 51\n1  another therapeutic group home far from his home county.  In September 2013, the state \n2  moved B.T. to yet another therapeutic group home. \n3  64.  In March 2014, the state moved B.T. to a non-therapeutic family foster \n4  home, but this placement disrupted after the state failed to provide B.T. with any therapy to \n5  support his transition to a family home.  In July 2014, B.T. was moved to another non-\n6  therapeutic foster home.  By September, B.T. had only had a single therapy session.   \n7  65.   In October, DCS moved B.T. to a shelter where he stayed for more than a \n8  month.  B.T. did not receive any therapy sessions in the placement.  In early November, \n9  his Child and Family Team (โCFTโ) recommended and the state approved B.T. for a \n10  therapeutic HCTC placement.  No such placement was made.  Instead, DCS placed B.T. in \n11  another therapeutic group home.   \n12  66.  Almost every time the state has moved B.T. over the last three and a half \n13  years, he had to go to a new school.   \n14  67.  In December 2014, B.T. threatened to commit suicide while living in the \n15  therapeutic group home.  In January 2015, B.T. was placed in juvenile detention in \n16  Maricopa County following an incident in a prior group home.   \n17  68.  Now 14 years old, B.T. has spent half his life in Arizona foster care custody \n18  and does not expect to find a permanent family.   \n19  A.A. \n20  69.  A.A. is a ten-year-old boy in state foster care currently living in a non-\n21  therapeutic group home.  His current permanency goal is adoption.  He was taken into state \n22  foster care custody most recently in September 2011 with his nine-year-old brother.  \n23  During his time in state care, A.A. has been placed in institutional care; deprived of \n24  necessary physical, dental and mental health care services; separated from his brother and \n25  deprived of sibling visitation; and, has been subject to missed visits by his state child \n26  welfare caseworker.  As a result of these experiences, A.A. has been subjected to \n27  emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n28 \n14\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 15 of 51\n1  70.  A.A. and his younger brother were taken into state foster care custody after \n2  their father committed suicide in mid-2011.  This was their second time in state care.  They \n3  had also been in state foster care custody prior to 2007.  Their motherโs parental rights \n4  were terminated in January 2007. \n5  71.  Following their fatherโs suicide, the state placed A.A. and his brother in an \n6  unlicensed kinship home with an uncle, his wife and their young son.  In November 2011, \n7  A.A.โs brother was removed from the home and placed in a therapeutic group home.  A.A. \n8  remained with his uncleโs family. \n9  72.  During the period from November 2012 to March 2013, the state failed to \n10  arrange for sibling visits between A.A. and his brother, and A.A.โs state caseworker failed \n11  to make monthly visits, as required under state policy.  In February 2013, the state was \n12  ordered to ensure that the boys had visitation with each other twice weekly.  The state was \n13  also ordered to transfer A.A.โs case to the adoption unit to begin the process of finding a \n14  permanent family.  As alleged below, the state failed to comply with that order.  \n15  73.  As of March 2013, A.A. had not had a routine physical or seen a dentist in a \n16  year.   \n17  74.  At a status hearing in April 2013, the juvenile court made a finding of โno \n18  reasonable effortsโ against the state for its failure to arrange for sibling visitation, to help \n19  A.A. progress with his schooling, and to transfer A.A.โs case to the adoption unit.  Despite \n20  this ruling, and despite the fact that A.A. had been free for adoption since he re-entered \n21  care in 2011, the state still failed to transfer A.A.โs case to the adoption unit 13 months \n22  later, in May 2014. \n23  75.  In November 2013, a mental health evaluation was scheduled for A.A. and \n24  his brother.  The appointment could not proceed because the state failed to arrange \n25  transportation for the boys.  As a result, the evaluation had to be re-scheduled for the \n26  following month.  \n27  76.  The evaluation was not completed until February 2014.  The evaluator \n28  concluded that more information was needed with regard to A.A.โs response to his fatherโs \n15\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 16 of 51\n1  suicide before any therapeutic services could be recommended.  Nonetheless, the state \n2  failed to request any further assessments. \n3  77.  In February 2014, A.A. also reported that his aunt and uncle left him for two \n4  to three hours at a time to care for his five-year-old cousin while they delivered \n5  newspapers in the early mornings.  Around the same time, A.A.โs uncle posted a video on \n6  YouTube of himself tasering a 15-year-old child living in the house while another child is \n7  heard crying in the background.  A.A.โs aunt and uncle were also using corporal \n8  punishment to discipline A.A.  While these facts were known to the state, it never \n9  investigated them. \n10  78.  That same month, A.A.โs uncle and aunt announced that they were leaving \n11  the state and would not be taking A.A. with them.  A.A. was thereupon removed from the \n12  uncleโs home and placed in the same foster/adoptive home as his brother, but no services \n13  were put in place for the first three weeks to help A.A. with the transition.  Shortly after \n14  being placed in the foster/adoptive home, A.A. started saying he wanted to die.  \n15  79.  The state subsequently moved A.A. to an emergency respite foster home.  \n16  His brotherโs foster family told the state it was willing to have A.A. return to live with \n17  them, but not until A.A. received the behavioral health services he needed.  Nevertheless, \n18  in April 2014, the state moved A.A. to a non-therapeutic group home out of his home \n19  county and 1ยฝ hours away from his brother.  The state did not arrange visits between the \n20  two boys.  \n21  80.  In May 2014, the juvenile court directed the state to immediately place A.A. \n22  back in his home county.  As A.A. was receiving no therapy or counseling at the time, the \n23  court also ordered the state to provide therapy for A.A. immediately, beginning no later \n24  than the end of the month.  However, in July 2014, DCS again failed to coordinate A.A.โs \n25  transportation and A.A. was unable to go to his scheduled psychological evaluation.   \n26  81.  Despite the May 2014 court order, A.A. remained in a non-therapeutic group \n27  home two hours away from his home community for five months.  During that time he had \n28 \n16\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 17 of 51\n1  to travel nearly two hours each way to obtain needed mental health services.  DCS moved \n2  A.A. to a non-therapeutic group home in his home county in September 2014. \n3  The C-B Siblings \n4  82.  The C-B siblings include two brothers, A.C-B and M.C-B, aged five and \n5  seven, and two sisters, J.C-B and D.C-B, aged three and six, all of whom were taken into \n6  state foster care custody in January 2014.  Their current permanency goal is reunification. \n7  During their time in state care, they have been unnecessarily separated, deprived of needed \n8  mental health care and parental visitation, and the sisters were placed in an inappropriate \n9  institutional setting.  As a result of these experiences, they have been subjected to \n10  emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n11  83.  Because of the traumatizing circumstances that led to their being taken into \n12  foster care, the siblingsโ lawyer requested at the first juvenile court hearing of the case in \n13  January 2014 that the state immediately provide the children with trauma therapy.  As \n14  alleged further below, the state delayed those services for nine months.      \n15  84.  The state initially placed the four siblings with a relative 2ยฝ hours away \n16  from the home from which they were removed.  Because of this distant placement, their \n17  urgent response assessments, required for every child taken into foster care, were delayed, \n18  and the children never received any behavioral health services while in this placement.  \n19  85.  In March 2014, the state removed the children from the relative and placed \n20  them in separate locations.  The state placed seven-year-old M.C-B and five-year-old \n21  A.C-B in a licensed family foster home.  Six-year-old D.C-B and three-year-old J.C-B \n22  were placed in a non-therapeutic group home.  None of the siblings received behavioral \n23  health services while in these placements. \n24  86.  That same month, M.C-B and A.C-Bโs foster parents requested that M.C-B \n25  receive a psychological evaluation.  The evaluation was not conducted for eight months.   \n26  87.  In April 2014, the state moved all four of the C-B siblings to their fatherโs \n27  home.  The childrenโs state child welfare case manager never visited them in the home. \n28  The state also failed to ensure that any of the children received behavioral health services \n17\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 18 of 51\n1  or counseling, even though D.C-B and A.C-B were exhibiting sexualized behaviors \n2  indicative of possible sexual abuse.  Only two weeks after being placed there, the \n3  childrenโs father requested that the state remove them. \n4  88.  In May 2014, the state again split up the siblings, this time into three \n5  different foster homes.  M.C-B and A.C-B were placed in the same foster home where they \n6  had previously been placed.  The state placed each of the girls, D.C-B and J.C-B, in \n7  separate foster homes.    \n8  89.  From the time they were taken into custody to May 2014, none of the \n9  siblings had any visits with their biological mother.   \n10  90.  Following a juvenile court hearing in early June 2014, DCS agreed to ensure \n11  that all four children receive therapy โ not just an intake or enrollment โ with a trauma \n12  therapist by June 20.  DCS also agreed to pay for the services if DHS would not pay.  In \n13  addition, the court directed DCS to provide the children with relational therapy with both \n14  parents.  DCS further agreed to work with the childrenโs father to help meet his \n15  transportation needs in order to facilitate visitation with the children, including providing \n16  him with a gas card.  DCS failed to provide any of these services or supports.    \n17  91.  Consequently, on July 2, 2014, the juvenile court made a โno reasonable \n18  effortsโ finding with regard to DCSโs failure to provide services for the siblings.  The court \n19  called the agencyโs conduct โappalling.โ  \n20  92.  In late July 2014, D.C-B was placed in the same foster home as M.C-B and \n21  A.C-B.  J.C-B remains in a separate foster home.   \n22  93.  In August 2014, eight months after being brought into foster care, the three \n23  eldest siblings finally had their behavioral health evaluations completed.   \n24  94.  In mid-September 2014, nine months after being taken into foster care, \n25  M.C-B and A.C-B had received only one therapy session.  Though their CFT \n26  recommended that they receive weekly therapy sessions, the facility where the therapist is \n27  located can only accommodate therapy sessions every other week.   \n28 \n18\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 19 of 51\n1  95.  By September 2014, D.C-B had received only two sessions with a therapist.  \n2  J.C-B had an intake meeting with her therapist, but her therapy sessions had not yet started.  \n3  96.  In December 2014, the state had only just begun the psychological \n4  evaluation that M.C-Bโs foster parents first requested in March 2014.  In addition, M.C-B \n5  and A.C-B are both struggling in school with attention problems. \n6  J.M.  \n7  97.  J.M. is an eight-year-old boy who was taken into foster care when he was six \n8  years old.  His current permanency goal is adoption.  During his time in state foster care \n9  custody, J.M. has been deprived of needed mental health care, placed in institutions on \n10  numerous occasions, and has had his education repeatedly disrupted.  As a result of these \n11  experiences, J.M. has been subjected to emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable \n12  risk of harm. \n13  98.  J.M. was brought into state foster care in May 2012.  The state initially \n14  placed him in a shelter for five days, then moved him to live with his grandmother.  When \n15  she could not care for him, the state moved J.M. to a group home in a different county.  \n16  J.M. remained there for two months. \n17  99.  In July 2012, the state moved J.M. to an unlicensed kinship home back in his \n18  home community.  J.M. entered first grade that summer.  The state failed to ensure that \n19  J.M. had transportation to and from school.  As a consequence, J.M. missed sixty days of \n20  schooling. \n21  100.  In September 2013, J.M. was moved to another kinship placement two hours \n22  from his home county.  As a result of this placement change, J.M. had to start second grade \n23  at a new school.  The move also resulted in a change in J.M.โs mental health providers, \n24  disrupting his mental health care.  \n25  101.  In October 2013, the state moved J.M. to a licensed family foster home back \n26  in his home county, resulting in yet another school change for J.M.  \n27  102.  In February 2014, the state moved J.M. to a non-therapeutic group home in \n28  another county two hours away.  As a result, he had to enroll at his fourth school in less \n19\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 20 of 51\n1  than two years since being brought into state foster care.  His teachers began developing an \n2  Individualized Education Program (โIEPโ) for him, but it was not finalized or \n3  implemented.  He was also diagnosed with ADHD.  \n4  103.  Between February and June 2014, J.M. had to move among four different \n5  group homes, all two hours from his home community.  During this period, the state took \n6  the position that J.M. could not be placed in an HCTC therapeutic foster home until he had \n7  first received, and exhausted, out-patient counseling.  But each time J.M. was forced to \n8  move to a different group home, he had to start his therapy over again with a new therapist.  \n9  104.  J.M.โs visitation with his mother was also disrupted when he was moved \n10  among these various group homes.  J.M. has no siblings and his mother is his only intimate \n11  family relationship.  She had trouble traveling the two hours by bus to see J.M. at his group \n12  homes and the state refused to coordinate alternative transportation for her.  Instead, the \n13  state required eight-year-old J.M. to travel three hours each way in a transport van for a \n14  two-hour visit with his mother.   \n15  105.  In June 2014, DCS removed J.M. from his most recent group home and \n16  returned him to a shelter.  This placement resulted in another disruption in his education \n17  and mental health treatment.  With each educational disruption, J.M.โs new school has had \n18  to re-start the IEP process of assessment and planning.  DCS has failed to ensure that his \n19  IEP was completed or provided to his new school, which had to be ordered by the juvenile \n20  court.   \n21  106.  Later in June 2014, the state finally approved J.M. for an HCTC placement \n22  after counseling proved inadequate.  However, at that time, there were no HCTC \n23  placements available and J.M. continued to live at the shelter for four months.  In late \n24  October, DCS moved him to a licensed non-therapeutic foster home.  It was not until \n25  November 2014 that his current school concluded the necessary evaluations and finalized \n26  his IEP.  \n27 \n28 \n20\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 21 of 51\n1  J.C. \n2  107.  J.C. is a ten-year-old boy who was taken into state foster care when he was \n3  eight.  His current permanency goal is adoption.  During the 2ยฝ years he has been in \n4  Arizona foster care, J.C. has suffered delays in needed health care treatment after being \n5  diagnosed with PTSD; he has been placed in inappropriate institutional settings; and he has \n6  been shuffled through numerous schools.  He was also physically abused while in state \n7  custody.  As a result of these experiences, J.C. has been subjected to emotional and \n8  physical harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n9  108.  J.C. was brought into state foster care custody in March 2012.  He displayed \n10  behaviors that suggested he had been sexually abused, and was placed in an HCTC home.  \n11  However, in September 2012, he was moved from that home and placed in a non-\n12  therapeutic group home.  Not surprisingly, his mental health immediately deteriorated.  \n13  Among other things, he soiled his pants and banged his head against the wall.  Despite this, \n14  the state kept J.C. in the group home for seven months. \n15  109.  The state moved J.C. back with his father in March 2013, while retaining \n16  legal custody over J.C.  J.C.โs father did not take Jacob to his therapy sessions.  \n17  Nonetheless, the state left J.C. with his father and failed to ensure that J.C. received the \n18  care he needed.   \n19  110.  Two months later, nine-year-old J.C. attempted suicide by taking an \n20  overdose of his psychotropic medication.  He was transported to the emergency room and \n21  admitted to a psychiatric hospital for ten days.  The state then returned him to his fatherโs \n22  home, still retaining legal custody over J.C.   \n23  111.  In March 2014, J.C. disclosed that his father had been physically abusing \n24  him by hitting him with a belt.  The state then removed J.C. from his fatherโs home.  The \n25  abuse was so severe that the police criminally investigated J.C.โs beating.  \n26  112.  After removing him from his father, the state placed J.C. in a non-therapeutic \n27  group home.  As a result of this placement change, J.C. had to change schools and has had \n28  significant problems adjusting.  In July, DCS moved J.C. again, this time to a therapeutic \n21\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 22 of 51\n1  group home in another county, resulting in another school disruption.  In August 2014, \n2  DCS moved J.C. to an HCTC foster home, where he currently lives.  \n3  B.  The Next Friends \n4  113.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Defendant Charles Flanagan is the Director of DCS and is being sued in his \n17  official capacity.  Director Flanagan maintains his principal office at the Department of \n18  Child Safety, 1717 West Jefferson S/C005A, Phoenix, Arizona 85007.  Director Flanagan \n19  is mandated under state law to carry out the purposes of DCS, including the formulation of \n20  policies, plans and programs to effectuate DCSโs missions and purposes.  \n21  117.  Defendant William Humble is the Director of DHS and is being sued in his \n22  official capacity.  Director Humble maintains his principal office at the Department of \n23  Health Services, 150 North 18th Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85007.  Director Humble is \n24  mandated under state law to administer DHS, including the formulation of policies, plans \n25  and programs to provide mental and behavioral health services to children in DCS foster \n26  care custody. \n27 \n28 \n22\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 23 of 51\n1  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION โ VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFSโ SUBSTANTIVE \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n2 \n3  118.  Paragraphs 1-117 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth \n4  herein. \n5  119.  This claim is asserted against defendants Flanagan and Humble in their \n6  official capacities on behalf of a class of children who are or will be in the legal custody of \n7  the Arizona Department of Child Safety due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect \n8  (the โGeneral Classโ). \n9  120.  DCS provides and is legally obligated to provide members of the General \n10  Class with physical and dental health care services through the state Comprehensive \n11  Medical and Dental Program (โCMDPโ).  DCS administers the CMDP. \n12  121.  DHS provides and is legally obligated to provide members of the General \n13  Class with mental and behavioral health services through ADHS Behavioral Health \n14  Services (โBHSโ).  BHS delivers these services through contracts with Regional \n15  Behavioral Health Authorities (โRBHAsโ) across the state. \n16  122.  DCS is also responsible for monitoring the physical, behavioral and \n17  emotional health status and needs of all members of the General Class and coordinating the \n18  physical, behavioral and mental health services provided to those children to ensure that \n19  they receive the health care services they need while in state care.  \n20  123.  Many children in state foster care need such services to help them cope with \n21  the significant trauma to which they were exposed before being removed from their homes. \n22  For example, according to the Arizona Office of the Auditor General, โas of September \n23  2013, approximately 31 percent of the children in out-of-home care aged 13 or older were \n24  clinically diagnosed as emotionally disturbed.โ \n25  124.  DCS and DHS are failing to fulfill their obligations to provide, coordinate \n26  and monitor medical, dental, mental and behavioral health services to members of the \n27  General Class.  As a result, members of the General Class are being harmed and subjected \n28  to an unreasonable risk of harm and deterioration while in DCS state foster care custody. \n23\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 24 of 51\n1  125.  In both its 2011 and 2012 annual reports, Arizonaโs state-wide Citizen \n2  Review Panel (โCRPโ) found that many children in state foster care were not receiving \n3  adequate mental and behavioral health assessments and services.  The CRP โrepeatedly \n4  observed untreated mental health problemsโ among children in state foster care.  It also \n5  found that a โlack of access to comprehensive and timely mental health assessments and \n6  services exacerbated the problems of the childrenโ and resulted in, among other things, \n7  โmultiple disrupted foster and adoptive placements, delays in children obtaining \n8  permanency, and CPS involvement in the next generation of children.โ \n9  126.  Moreover, according to the CRPโs 2012 report, โ[w]hen services were \n10  provided, they were observed to be brief and limited with cases being closed without \n11  observation of sustained behavior changes and few aftercare services in place.  When \n12  children were removed, delays between the time of referral and assessment were observed \n13  to cause even longer delays before intervention was provided.โ  \n14  127.  Similarly, in its 2013 Report, the CRP found that โthe continuum of services \n15  . . . for families is limited.โ  According to the report, โcomprehensive services were lacking \n16  and existing services are unable to maintain long term change in these families.โ   \n17  128.  The CRP is not alone in noting unacceptable shortages and delays in the \n18  provision of needed services.  According to a 2012 report issued by DESโs own consultant, \n19  โ[a]s much as half of the time a child spends in [foster care] is spent waiting on services.โ  \n20  More recently, the Office of the Auditor Generalโs report on DCS policy and practice \n21  recognized the โ[i]nadequate access to behavioral health servicesโ for youth in foster care. \n22  129.  The Arizona Chapter of the Foster Family-Based Treatment Association \n23  (โFFTAโ) has also noted the severe shortage of mental health services delivered by \n24  professional foster homes (also known as โtherapeutic foster homesโ) to children in state \n25  foster care.  These services, referred to in Arizona as โHome Care Training to Home Care \n26  Client Servicesโ (โHCTCโ), are supposed to be available to children in state care who need \n27  therapeutic family-based intervention.  These therapeutic foster homes are administered by \n28 \n24\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 25 of 51\n1  DHS through RBHAs.  DCS pays room and board for children in state foster care placed in \n2  HCTC homes.  \n3  130.  There are currently only about 400 HCTC homes for more than 16,500 \n4  children in state foster care.  Moreover, most of these homes are only licensed for 1 or 2 \n5  placements, severely limiting the number of children for whom these homes are available.  \n6  The severe shortage of HCTC homes places members of the General Class at an \n7  unreasonable risk of deteriorating while in state care.  \n8  131.  The shortage of HCTC providers, coupled with the short-term nature of \n9  HCTC services (DHS has a practice of requiring such services to be re-authorized every 90 \n10  days), also subjects children in state care to emotionally harmful placement instability, as \n11  children are moved out of HCTC homes far too soon after being placed there.  The CRPโs \n12  2013 Report specifically found that the HCTC placement structure โcauses disruption \n13  when a specialized placement is required to meet a childโs needs.โ  This placement \n14  disruption causes children with higher needs to โyo-yoโ up and down in terms of their \n15  behaviors, thereby driving additional placement moves, which results in even further \n16  unnecessary re-traumatization.   \n17  132.  The Arizona Auditor General has also recognized the stateโs practice of \n18  failing to provide โlong-term solutions for children in need of continued supportโ for their \n19  mental health needs.  According to the Auditor Generalโs Report, โ[c]hildren whose \n20  behavioral health improves in therapeutic foster homes may be moved to less restrictive \n21  family settings, but without the same continued support, their behaviors may worsen, \n22  resulting in placement disruptions and subsequent placement in congregate care.โ  \n23  133.  DCS and DHS further abdicate their legal duty to provide care for members \n24  of the General Class by leaving the decision whether children should be placed in HCTC \n25  homes to the six RBHAs that operate throughout the state, rather than allowing that \n26  decision to be made by the childrenโs Child and Family Teams (โCFTsโ).  Making matters \n27  worse, the RBHAs have different processes for determining whether HCTC should be \n28  provided to the children in their geographic regions.  As a result, the availability of HCTC \n25\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 26 of 51\n1  turns in part on the fortuitous circumstance of where the member of the General Class \n2  happens to live at the time HCTC is requested.   \n3  134.  DCS caseworkers also fail to meet their obligation under agency policy to \n4  participate in CFT meetings, including inter-agency meetings with DHS, that are a \n5  prerequisite to members of the General Class receiving behavioral health services.  When \n6  DCS caseworkers do not join CFT meetings, essential information about a childโs needs is \n7  not shared, treatment planning and referrals are held up, and services are delayed.  These \n8  deficiencies expose members of the General Class to an undue risk that they will not \n9  receive the behavioral services they require, leading to a deterioration of the childโs \n10  condition while in state custody. \n11  135.  Remarkably, even former DES Director Carter acknowledged at an \n12  October 17, 2013 meeting of the CPS Oversight Committee that DES does not collect data \n13  in a way that enables the child welfare agency to show that a particular set of family \n14  interventions is effective.  At the same meeting, Ms. Sotomayor, then Assistant Director \n15  for the former DES Division of Children, Youth and Families, agreed that it is unclear \n16  whether a number of services provided by DES โare appropriate or adequateโ for families. \n17  136.  In addition to the lack of adequate mental health services, far too many \n18  children in state foster care fail to receive needed physical health care services.  According \n19  to the stateโs Practice Improvement Case Review (โPICRโ) for 2013, DCS failed to \n20  properly assess and address the childrenโs physical health needs in a third (34%) of the \n21  cases reviewed.  The same review found that 22% of children who had been in foster care \n22  for more than 12 months had not received a comprehensive physical health examination.  \n23  In addition, more than 40% of children who had been in care for less than a year did not \n24  receive an examination within 30 days as required by agency policy.  Based on the same \n25  2013 PICR, DCS had failed to assess and provide necessary services to address the \n26  childrenโs mental health needs in nearly one in five cases reviewed. \n27  137.  Based on the 2012 PICR, the state failed to meet the physical health care \n28  needs of children in state foster care in 49% of the cases reviewed.  \n26\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 27 of 51\n1  138.  Moreover, according to the stateโs own data, during federal fiscal year 2012, \n2  36% of children in state foster care ages three to six did not receive well-care visits \n3  required under the periodicity schedule that the state is required to establish under the \n4  EPSDT provisions of the federal Medicaid Act.  A nearly identical percentage of \n5  adolescents in foster care likewise failed to receive such required health care visits.  \n6  Similar failures in providing such services to these age groups were reported for federal \n7  fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011.  \n8  139.  In addition, according to the stateโs PICR for 2013, 34% of children who had \n9  been in state care for more than six months were found not to have had a dental \n10  examination within the most recent six months.  During 2012, the number of children who \n11  had missed required dentist visits was nearly four in ten. \n12  140.  The inadequacy of the health care services provided to the General Class \n13  subjects these children to harm and/or an unreasonable risk of suffering ongoing physical \n14  and emotional harm and deterioration while in state care. \n15  141.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n16  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n17  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n18  142.  Defendant Flanagan directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n19  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n20  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, \n21  from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial \n22  factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the General Classโs \n23  constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n24  143.  Defendant Humble directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n25  policies and practices regarding the provision of mental and behavioral health services by \n26  DHS.  The foregoing DHS policies and practices fail to satisfy its affirmative duty to \n27  protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, from an unreasonable risk of \n28  emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, \n27\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 28 of 51\n1  the ongoing violation of the General Classโs constitutionally protected liberty and privacy \n2  rights. \n3  144.  The foregoing policies and practices of DCS and DHS described herein \n4  constitute a policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside \n5  the exercise of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the \n6  constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs \n7  and other members of the General Class.  As a result, all members of the General Class \n8  have been harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm, in \n9  deprivation of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n10  Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n11  145.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  the right \n12  of members of the General Class to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of harm \n13  while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n14  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the General Class; the right to \n15  necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the General Class from \n16  deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise while in state care; \n17  and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring of the General Classโs \n18  safety and well-being.  \n19  146.  As of September 30, 2014, there were 16,990 members of the General Class.  \n20  The General Class is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder impracticable. \n21  147.  Named Plaintiffsโ First Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n22  are common to, and typical of, all members of the General Class.  Such common questions \n23  of fact include:  \n24  a.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n25  General Class with legally required medical and dental services necessary to keep \n26  the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent them from \n27  deteriorating physically while in state custody;  \n28 \n28\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 29 of 51\n1  b.  Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n2  General Class with legally required mental and behavioral health services necessary \n3  to keep the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent them from \n4  deteriorating emotionally and psychologically while in state custody; and  \n5  c.   Whether DCS has a practice of failing to coordinate and ensure that \n6  the General Class are provided with the legally required mental and behavioral \n7  health services to keep the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent \n8  them from deteriorating emotionally and psychologically while in state custody. \n9  148.  Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs and DHSโs actions \n10  and inactions violate the General Classโs substantive due process rights to be free from \n11  harm and an unreasonable risk of harm while in state custody. \n12  149.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n13  General Class they seek to represent.  \n14  150.  Named Plaintiffs and the putative General Class are represented by: \n15  a.  Attorneys employed by Coppersmith Brockelman PLC, a private law \n16  firm based in Arizona with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest \n17  litigation, including class action litigation;   \n18  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n19  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n20  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n21  action litigation; and \n22  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n23  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n24  welfare class actions nationally.  \n25  151.  The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n26  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the General Class. \n27 \n28 \n29\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 30 of 51\n1  152.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n2  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n3  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n4  153.  Defendants Flanagan and Humble have acted or failed to act on grounds \n5  generally applicable to the General Class, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n6  Plaintiffsโ counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the General Class. \n7 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION โ VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFSโ RIGHTS \nUNDER THE EPSDT PROVISIONS OF THE MEDICAID ACT  \n8 \n9  154.  Paragraphs 1-153 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth \n10  herein. \n11  155.  This claim is asserted against defendants Flanagan and Humble in their \n12  official capacities on behalf of all members of the General Class who are eligible for \n13  Medicaid (the โMedicaid Subclassโ).  \n14  156.  Medicaid is a joint federal-state program under Title XIX of the Social \n15  Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396, et seq., designed to provide medically necessary physical \n16  and mental health care to, among others, eligible children. \n17  157.  States that choose to participate in the Medicaid program are reimbursed by \n18  the federal government for a portion of the cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  To \n19  receive federal funds, states must comply with the requirements set forth in Title XIX of \n20  the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations.  Among those requirements, \n21  states are required to develop state plans that identify the medical services available to \n22  eligible beneficiaries. \n23  158.  Children in state foster care are eligible beneficiaries of Medicaid services \n24  under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I). \n25  159.  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(a)(4)(B), states are \n26  required to provide EPSDT services to eligible children in state foster care.  The required \n27  screening services are set forth in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1), while ยงยง 1396a(a)(43)(C) and \n28  1396d(r)(5) require states to provide necessary health care, diagnostic services and treatment \n30\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 31 of 51\n1  to correct or ameliorate defects or physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered \n2  by those screening services.   \n3  160.  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1)(A)(i) and 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.58, states are \n4  required to establish periodicity schedules setting forth when the screening services \n5  required under the Medicaid Act must be provided.    \n6  161.  Moreover, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. ยง 435.930(a), states \n7  must provide EPSDT services with reasonable promptness. \n8  162.  The policy underlying the EPSDT mandate is to prevent illness, as well as to \n9  ensure that health problems are comprehensively diagnosed and then treated as soon as \n10  they are detected, before they become more complex and their treatment more costly. \n11  163.  Pursuant to a contract with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment \n12  System (โAHCCCSโ), DCS serves as the statewide administrator responsible for the \n13  provision of physical, dental, vision and hearing health care services, including screening, \n14  diagnostic and treatment services, to members of the Medicaid Subclass.  In that capacity, \n15  DCS is legally obligated to ensure that members of the Medicaid Subclass receive such \n16  medical services.  DCS provides such medical services through CMDP.  \n17  164.  DCS also determines the Medicaid eligibility of every child in state foster \n18  care custody.  \n19  165.  Pursuant to a contract with AHCCCS, DHS serves as the statewide \n20  administrator responsible for the provision of mental and behavioral health care services, \n21  including screening, diagnostic and treatment services, to members of the Medicaid \n22  Subclass.  In that capacity, DHS is legally obligated to ensure that members of the \n23  Medicaid Subclass receive such medical services.  DHS provides such services through \n24  BHS, which, in turn, delivers these services through contracts with RBHAs across the \n25  state. \n26  166.  Under Arizonaโs EPSDT Periodicity Schedule, DCS is required to provide \n27  annual physical examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass who are age three and \n28  older, and more frequent physical examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass \n31\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 32 of 51\n1  under age three.  The stateโs Periodicity Schedule further requires DCS to provide annual \n2  vision screenings to members of the Medicaid Subclass ages 4-6, 8, 10 and 12 years old, \n3  and semi-annual dental examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass who are six \n4  months of age or older. \n5  167.  DCSโs Policy and Procedure Manual further provides that it is the \n6  responsibility of the DCS foster care caseworker to ensure that a child entering foster care \n7  be given a complete medical examination that meets EPSDT requirements within 30 days \n8  after initial placement in out-of-home care. \n9  168.  As for mental and behavioral health services, DHS is required under \n10  Arizonaโs EPSDT Periodicity Schedule to provide members of the Medicaid Subclass age \n11  three and older with annual psychosocial/behavioral assessments.  For members of the \n12  Medicaid Subclass under the age of three, the Periodicity Schedule requires DHS to \n13  provide more frequent psychosocial/behavioral assessments. \n14  169.  Under DHS policy, DHS is also responsible for conducting an Urgent \n15  Response assessment of every child within 24 hours of removal from his or her home to \n16  detect both initial and delayed effects of trauma.   \n17  170.  Defendants have a practice of failing to provide members of the Medicaid \n18  Subclass with the screening, diagnostic and treatment services required under the EPSDT \n19  provisions of the Medicaid Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), \n20  1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and 1396d(r). \n21  171.  Defendants also have a practice of failing to provide such services with \n22  reasonable promptness, in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. ยง 435.930(a). \n23  172.  The foregoing policies and practices of defendant Flanagan, who directly and \n24  indirectly controls and is responsible for the policies and practices of DCS, and defendant \n25  Humble, who directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the policies and \n26  practices of DHS, violate the rights of Named Plaintiffs and the Medicaid Subclass under \n27  the Medicaid Act. \n28 \n32\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 33 of 51\n1  173.  As of September 30, 2014, there were over 10,000 members of the Medicaid \n2  Subclass.  The Medicaid Subclass is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder \n3  impracticable. \n4  174.  Named Plaintiffsโ Second Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law \n5  that are common to, and typical of, all members of the Medicaid Subclass.  Such common \n6  questions of fact include:  \n7  a.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n8  Medicaid Subclass with screening services that comply with the stateโs Periodicity \n9  Schedule;    \n10  b.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n11  Medicaid Subclass with medically necessary diagnostic and treatment services;    \n12  c.   Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n13  Medicaid Class with screening services that comply with the stateโs Periodicity \n14  Schedule; and  \n15  d.  Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n16  Medicaid Subclass with medically necessary diagnostic and treatment services. \n17  175.  Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs and DHSโs actions \n18  and inactions violate the Medicaid Subclassโs rights under the EPSDT provisions of the \n19  federal Medicaid Act.  \n20  176.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n21  Medicaid Subclass they seek to represent.  \n22  177.  Named Plaintiffs and the putative Medicaid Subclass are represented by:  \n23  a.  Attorneys employed by Coppersmith Brockelman PLC, a private law \n24  firm based in Arizona with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest \n25  litigation, including class action litigation;   \n26  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n27  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n28 \n33\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 34 of 51\n1  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n2  action litigation; and \n3  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n4  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n5  welfare class actions nationally.  \n6  178.  The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n7  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Medicaid Subclass. \n8  179.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n9  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n10  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n11  180.  Defendants Flanagan and Humble have acted or failed to act on grounds \n12  generally applicable to the Medicaid Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive \n13  relief.  Plaintiffsโ counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the \n14  Medicaid Subclass. \n15 \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION โ VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFSโ SUBSTANTIVE \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n16 \n17  181.  Paragraphs 1-180 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth \n18  herein. \n19  182.  This claim is asserted on behalf of the General Class against defendant \n20  Flanagan in his official capacity. \n21 \nMembers of the General Class Are Not Receiving Timely Investigations of \nReports That They Have Been Maltreated in State Custody. \n22 \n23  183.  In late 2013, it was publicly disclosed for the first time that the State had \n24  failed to investigate 6,600 reports of alleged child abuse and neglect between 2009 and \n25  2013, choosing instead to simply set those reports aside.  In July 2014, it was disclosed \n26  that in another 14,000 cases, no documentation had been entered in the childโs or familyโs \n27  case file for 60 days or more through April 2014.  \n28 \n34\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 35 of 51\n1  184.  While the legislation passed on May 29, 2014 attempts to address those \n2  enormous backlogs, DCSโs failure to complete child maltreatment investigations in a \n3  timely manner is not limited to those 20,600 reports and cases.  In fact, DCS is also failing \n4  to initiate and complete investigations in a timely manner of reports that children have \n5  been abused or neglected while in state care.  DESโs own consultants acknowledged in \n6  2012 that foster care workers โoften have a backlogโ of new maltreatment reports \n7  involving children in state custody. \n8  185.  According to the stateโs own data, during federal fiscal year 2012, the state \n9  failed to initiate investigations into 36% of all reports that children in state foster care \n10  custody had been abused or neglected, within the time frames required under state policy. \n11  During the six-month period from October 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013, 54% of all \n12  investigations involving children in state care were initiated late.  \n13  186.  State law and agency policy further requires that the outcomes of child \n14  maltreatment investigations be entered into the Stateโs child welfare information database \n15  within 45 days and that investigations be closed within 60 days.  However, according to \n16  state data, during the six-month period from October 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013, the State \n17  failed to meet this 60-day deadline in the large majority of investigations involving \n18  children already in state care, regardless of the level of risk to which members of the \n19  General Class were exposed.  In fact, 72% of investigations into high risk reports involving \n20  a present danger to children in state care were still not closed after 60 days; 73% of \n21  investigations into reports involving an impending danger to children in care were not \n22  closed in a timely manner; 72% of investigations into reports that children in care had been \n23  abused or neglected within the past 30 days were not closed within the required period; \n24  and 78% of investigations were not closed within the required timeframe where the reports \n25  involved children in state care who had been abused or neglected more than 30 days prior, \n26  the date of the last occurrence of abuse or neglect was unknown, or the child was exposed \n27  to an unreasonable risk of harm.   \n28 \n35\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 36 of 51\n1  187.  These widespread delays in initiating and completing investigations into \n2  reported child abuse and neglect subject members of the General Class to an unreasonable \n3  risk of physical and emotional harm while in state care. \n4  188.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n5  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n6  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n7  189.  Defendant Flanagan directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n8  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n9  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, \n10  from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial \n11  factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the General Classโs \n12  constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n13  190.  The foregoing policies and practices of DCS described herein constitute a \n14  policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside the exercise \n15  of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally \n16  protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs and other \n17  members of the General Class.  As a result, all members of the General Class have been \n18  harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm, in deprivation of \n19  their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n20  United States Constitution. \n21  191.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right \n22  of members of the General Class to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of harm \n23  while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n24  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the General Class; the right to \n25  necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the General Class from \n26  deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise while in state care; \n27  and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring of the General Classโs \n28  safety and well-being. \n36\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 37 of 51\n1  192.  As of September 30, 2014, there were 16,990 members of the General Class. \n2  The General Class is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder impracticable. \n3  193.  Named Plaintiffsโ Third Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n4  are common to, and typical of, all members of the General Class.  Such common questions \n5  of fact include whether DCS has a practice of failing to conduct timely investigations into \n6  reports that members of the General Class have been abused or neglected while in state \n7  foster care custody. \n8  194.  Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n9  violate the General Classโs substantive due process rights to be free from harm and an \n10  unreasonable risk of harm while in state custody. \n11  195.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n12  General Class they seek to represent.  \n13  196.  Named Plaintiffs and the putative General Class are represented by: \n14  a.  Attorneys employed by Coppersmith Brockelman PLC, a private law \n15  firm based in Arizona with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest \n16  litigation, including class action litigation;   \n17  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n18  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n19  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n20  action litigation; and  \n21  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n22  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n23  welfare class actions nationally.  \n24  197.  The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n25  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the General Class. \n26  198.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n27  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n28  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n37\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 38 of 51\n1  199.  Defendant Flanagan has acted or failed to act on grounds generally \n2  applicable to the General Class, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffsโ \n3  counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the General Class. \n4 \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFSโ \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n5 \n6  200.  Paragraphs 1-199 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth \n7  herein. \n8  201.  This claim is asserted against Defendant Flanagan in his official capacity on \n9  behalf of all members of the General Class, except those children who are or will be in a \n10  kinship placement (the โNon-Kinship Subclassโ). \n11 \nA.  The Non-Kinship Subclass Suffers from a Severe Shortage of Foster \nHomes. \n12 \n13  202.  The State has failed to provide members of the Non-Kinship Subclass with an \n14  adequate number and array of foster care placements.  The severe shortage of foster care \n15  placements frequently results in the State placing members of the Non-Kinship Subclass in \n16  the first available bed, rather than selecting placements based on the childrenโs needs. \n17  203.  While Arizonaโs population of children in out-of-home care has grown by \n18  56% from September 2009 to March 2014, the number of Arizona foster families has only \n19  increased by 9%, and the percentage of children placed in licensed foster homes has \n20  decreased by 9%, during the same time period.  \n21  204.  As of September 30, 2014, there were 9,418 children in state foster care who \n22  were not placed with relatives or in trial home reunification settings.  Nevertheless, the \n23  State reported that it had licensed only 4,397 foster homes to accept children in state care.  \n24  Moreover, these foster homes provided only 5,669 available spaces that could potentially \n25  match the needs of the children in DCSโs custody.  Even assuming that each of these \n26  spaces matched the needs of the Non-Kinship Class, 3,749 class members would still be \n27  without a foster home.  \n28 \n38\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 39 of 51\n1  205.  A spokeswoman for DCS acknowledged in July 2014 that the department \n2  โdesperately needs more foster families to care for the increased number of children in out-\n3  of-home care.โ   \n4  206.  A recent DCS report stated that โ[h]omes are needed for children of all ages, \n5  however the most significant shortages of homes are for teens, sibling groups, and children \n6  who have complex medical needs.โ  The agency admits that โ[t]here is a significant need \n7  for additional foster and adoptive homes in all areas of Arizona.โ \n8  207.  According to a recent audit by the Arizona Auditor General, the state โhas not \n9  adequately implementedโ performance-based contracting in the contracts it has entered into \n10  with private child placing agencies to recruit foster parents, identify and arrange child \n11  placement options, and supervise and monitor licensed foster parents.  The audit also found \n12  that the state has not developed policies and procedures for monitoring the performance \n13  measures in its contracts, has not used performance measure data to assess contractor \n14  performance, and has not adequately designed the contracts to incentivize performance. \n15  208.  In addition to the inadequate recruiting of new foster homes, a 2012 survey \n16  conducted by Arizona State University noted that programs and financial benefits available \n17  to foster families have been drastically cut in recent years due to severe budget constraints.  \n18  For example, in 2009, the state cut foster family reimbursement rates and allowances for \n19  clothing.  \n20  209.  The scarcity of foster homes in Arizona is a well-known problem.  In 2012, \n21  The Arizona Republic reported that โ[t]he state is in dire need of families to care for \n22  children removed from their homes because of suspected abuse or neglect.  But families \n23  leave the foster care system faster than new ones come in.  Many who leave say itโs not \n24  necessarily the children who have caused them to turn in their license but their frustration \n25  with the systemโs inability to help them.โ   \n26  210.  Defendant Flanagan has also acknowledged to members of the state \n27  legislature that there are many instances when children have slept in agency offices \n28  because the agency did not have a placement for them.  \n39\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 40 of 51\n1  211.  In fact, according to a recent press account, over just a six-day span from \n2  September 28 to October 4, 2014, 36 members of the Non-Kinship Subclass spent at least \n3  one night in DCS office buildings in Maricopa and Pima counties.  Of those 36 children, \n4  10 were between 2 and 5 years old, 11 were between 6 and 12 years old, and 15 were \n5  between 13 and 18 years old. According to Gene Burns, who supervises DCS after-hours \n6  units, โ[i]n the 17 years [he has] been here, the biggest shock to [him] is when [DCS] \n7  bought cribsโ for the young children sleeping at DCSโs offices.  As he acknowledged, \n8  โ[t]his is not the place to put a kid.โ  \n9 \nB.  Because of the Shortage of Foster Homes, Members of the Non-Kinship \nSubclass Are Frequently Placed Far from Their Home Communities. \n10 \n11  212.  DCSโs failure to maintain an adequate array of foster homes harms members \n12  of the Non-Kinship Subclass by causing them to be placed, or putting them at an \n13  unreasonable risk of being placed, far from their home communities.  Such placements \n14  disconnect members of the Non-Kinship Subclass from family, friends and neighbors, and \n15  frequently lead to highly disruptive changes in schooling.  \n16  213.  Only 31% of all children in foster care as of September 30, 2012, for whom \n17  removal and current zip code information was available, were placed within the same zip \n18  code as their homes.  Moreover, nearly half of these children were placed outside their \n19  home city.  \n20  214.  Consultants retained by DES reported that in 2011, almost 60% of children \n21  in state care were placed over an hour from their homes.  As the consultant recognized, \n22  โ[t]his makes parent visits and services difficult and contributes to Ongoing staff driving \n23  more hours and spending more time away from their other cases.โ \n24 \nC.  Because of the Shortage of Foster Homes, Members of the Non-Kinship \nSubclass Are Frequently Separated from Their Siblings. \n25 \n26  215.  For children entering state foster care, siblings can serve as a crucial buffer \n27  against the emotional upheaval of being separated from their parents.  Sibling relationships \n28  can also promote resilience as children navigate the trauma of removal.  In recognition of \n40\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 41 of 51\n1  the importance of maintaining sibling relationships, federal law requires states to make \n2  reasonable efforts to place siblings together, unless contrary to a siblingโs safety or well-\n3  being โ a requirement echoed in Arizona state policy.  \n4  216.  DCSโs failure to maintain an adequate array of foster homes harms members \n5  of the Non-Kinship Subclass by causing them to be separated, or putting them at an \n6  unreasonable risk of being separated, from their siblings.  As of September 30, 2013, the \n7  State failed to place all siblings together in 35% of cases, and failed to place at least two \n8  siblings together in 24% of cases.  Based on information the state submitted to the federal \n9  government in 2012, in nearly 40% of cases when at least two siblings entered out-of-\n10  home care, the State failed to place them together.  The Stateโs performance was nearly as \n11  bad every year from 2008 through 2011.  A DES official acknowledged in 2012 that it had \n12  become more difficult to place siblings in the same home because of the shortage of foster \n13  families and because more children stay in care longer. \n14  217.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n15  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n16  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n17  218.  Defendant Flanagan directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n18  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n19  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the Non-Kinship Subclass, including the Named \n20  Plaintiffs, from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a \n21  substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the Non-\n22  Kinship Subclassโs constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n23  219.  The foregoing policies and practices of DCS described herein constitute a \n24  policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside the exercise \n25  of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally \n26  protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs and other \n27  members of the Non-Kinship Subclass.  As a result, all members of the Non-Kinship \n28  Subclass have been harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of \n41\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 42 of 51\n1  harm, in deprivation of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n2  Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n3  220.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  the right \n4  of members of the Non-Kinship Subclass to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of \n5  harm while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n6  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the Non-Kinship Subclass; the \n7  right to necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the Non-Kinship \n8  Subclass from deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise \n9  while in state care; and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring of the \n10  Non-Kinship Subclassโs safety and well-being.  \n11  221.  As of September 30, 2014, there were 9,454 members of the Non-Kinship \n12  Subclass.  The Non-Kinship Subclass is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder \n13  impracticable. \n14  222.  Named Plaintiffsโ Fourth Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law \n15  that are common to, and typical of, all members of the Non-Kinship Subclass.  Such \n16  common questions of fact include:  \n17  a.  Whether DCS maintains an adequate number and array of foster home \n18  placements for members of the Non-Kinship Subclass; and  \n19  b.  Whether a shortage of foster homes subjects members of the Non-\n20  Kinship Subclass to an unreasonable risk of being placed far from their families, \n21  schools and home communities.  \n22  223.  Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n23  violate the Non-Kinship Subclassโs substantive due process rights to be free from harm \n24  and an unreasonable risk of harm while in state custody. \n25  224.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Non-\n26  Kinship Subclass they seek to represent.  \n27  225.  Named Plaintiffs and the putative Non-Kinship Subclass are represented by: \n28 \n42\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 43 of 51\n1  a.  Attorneys employed by Coppersmith Brockelman PLC, a private law \n2  firm based in Arizona with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest \n3  litigation, including class action litigation;   \n4  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n5  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n6  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n7  action litigation; and \n8  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n9  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n10  welfare class actions nationally.  \n11  226.  The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n12  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Non-Kinship Subclass. \n13  227.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n14  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n15  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n16  228.  Defendant Flanagan has acted or failed to act on grounds generally \n17  applicable to the Non-Kinship Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n18  Plaintiffsโ counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the Non-Kinship \n19  Subclass. \n20 \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFSโ RIGHTS TO \nFAMILY INTEGRITY UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n21 \n22  229.  Paragraphs 1-228 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n23  230.  This claim is asserted against Defendant Flanagan in his official capacity on \n24  behalf of all members of the General Class who have been assigned a permanency goal of \n25  family reunification (the โReunification Subclassโ). \n26  231.  Despite the fact that over 50% of children in state care have a permanency \n27  goal of family reunification, the State is failing to preserve family relationships after \n28  children are removed from their homes.  \n43\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 44 of 51\n1  232.  One of the principal ways that states preserve the family relationships of \n2  children in foster care is to place siblings together when they are removed from their \n3  homes, as required under federal and state law.  In 2012, however, Arizona failed to place \n4  siblings together in nearly 40% of cases when at least two siblings entered out-of-home \n5  care.  As of September 30, 2013, the state failed to place all siblings together in 35% of \n6  cases, and failed to place at least two siblings together in 24% of cases.  \n7  233.  Moreover, as alleged in paragraphs 212-214 above, the state routinely places \n8  children in its care far from their home communities, knowingly interfering with their \n9  ability to maintain connections with their families.    \n10  234.  Another way that states preserve the family relationships of children in foster \n11  care is to place such children, when appropriate, with one or both biological parents on a \n12  โtrial reunificationโ basis, while maintaining legal custody over the child.  Arizona, \n13  however, systematically fails to do so.  As of September 30, 2014, only 0.21% of children \n14  in state custody (36 out of 16,990 children) were placed with their parents on a trial \n15  reunification basis.  \n16  235.  As of September 30, 2013, only 0.29% of children in out-of-home care (23 \n17  of the 7,875 children) who had a permanency goal of family reunification were in a trial \n18  reunification placement.  \n19  236.  Similarly, only 1.6% of the children in care who exited to reunification \n20  during federal fiscal year 2012 (60 out of 3,684) were in a trial home visit placement at the \n21  time of exit.  The national average was 37.5%.  Moreover, only 0.5% of children in \n22  custody during federal fiscal year 2012 (97 out of 21,267) had a most recent placement \n23  type of trial home visit.  The national average was 11.0%.  \n24  237.  When children in state custody are not placed with their families on a trial \n25  reunification basis, DCS is under a legal duty to coordinate contact between these children \n26  and their biological parents, as well as any siblings from whom the child may have been \n27  separated when taken into custody.  The state has recognized that โthere is a strong \n28  correlation between consistent and timely visitation and positive outcomes for children \n44\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 45 of 51\n1  who have been removed from their home.  Regular parent-child visitation, along with CPS \n2  Specialistsโ visits with the child, are both associated with achieving permanency and other \n3  indicators of child well-being.โ   \n4  238.  For 2012, however, the state reported that barely half (51%) of children in \n5  out-of-home care whose cases were reviewed as part of the child welfare agencyโs PICR \n6  had visits with their parents and siblings at a frequency consistent with the childโs safety \n7  and best interests.  During calendar year 2013, a similarly low percentage of children \n8  (56%) whose cases were reviewed in connection with the PICR had adequate visits with \n9  parents and siblings.     \n10  239.  The Stateโs poor performance in coordinating family visits is no surprise \n11  given the long wait lists that children in foster care face before being provided with \n12  transportation to and from, and supervision of, family visits.  As of October 2013, there \n13  were 475 families waiting for such visitation services.  Remarkably, the State does not \n14  even track how long families have been waiting for those services.  \n15  240.  The State further impairs family relationships by routinely failing to comply \n16  with its obligation to make monthly contact with the biological parents of children in state \n17  foster care.  During the six-month period from April 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014, \n18  1,213 out of 2,528 (48.0% of) parents of children in foster care with a case plan goal of \n19  reunification did not receive required visits from a state child welfare caseworker.  \n20  241.  Likewise, during the six-month period from October 1, 2013 through \n21  March 31, 2014, 1,152 out of 2,496 (46.2% of) parents of children in foster care with a \n22  case plan goal of reunification did not receive required visits from a state caseworker.  \n23  242.  DCS recently reported that during 2013, caseworkers made concerted efforts \n24  to have adequate contact with mothers in only 36% of cases reviewed, and with fathers in \n25  only 18% of cases reviewed. \n26  243.  Not surprisingly, given the stateโs failure to make adequate contact with the \n27  biological parents of children in foster care, the agency also systematically fails to involve \n28  those parents in their childrenโs case planning.  During 2013, the state made concerted \n45\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 46 of 51\n1  efforts to actively involve the childโs mother in case planning in only slightly more than \n2  half (54%) of cases reviewed, and to involve the father in little more than a third (36%) of \n3  cases.  According to DCS, โ[c]ase plans are not consistently developed and reassessed \n4  within required timeframes.โ \n5  244.  An all too predictable result of the stateโs failure to preserve family \n6  relationships is that far too few members of the Reunification Subclass are reunified with \n7  their families.  Moreover, when reunification does occur, it takes far too long.  \n8  245.  The amount of time that members of the Reunification Class spend in out-of-\n9  home care before being reunified with their families has also increased over time.  \n10  According to data prepared for the state, the percentage of children who reunified within \n11  90 days decreased from 30% for children who entered state foster care in 2008 to 18% for \n12  children who entered such care in 2012; the percentage of children who reunified within \n13  six months fell from 35% for the 2008 entry group to 23% for the 2012 entry group; and \n14  the percentage of children who reunified within one year fell from 44% for the 2008 entry \n15  group to 37% for the 2012 entry group.    \n16  246.  DCS is aware of its poor performance.  According to a 2014 agency report, \n17  โ[c]ompared to prior years, children are now less likely to exit to reunification, and they \n18  experience longer lengths of stay before reunifying.โ     \n19  247.  The foregoing DCS practices interfere with the right to family integrity held \n20  by members of the Reunification Subclass, and subject them to emotional harm and an \n21  unreasonable risk of emotional harm.  \n22  248.  Defendant Flanagan directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n23  policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing policies and practices fail to satisfy DCSโs \n24  affirmative duty to protect the welfare of the Reunification Subclass, which failure is a \n25  substantial factor leading to, and a proximate cause of, the violation of the constitutionally \n26  protected liberty interests, privacy interests and associational rights of all members of the \n27  Reunification Subclass.  \n28 \n46\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 47 of 51\n1  249.  The foregoing policies and practices of DCS amount to a policy, pattern, \n2  custom and/or practice that is outside the exercise of any professional judgment and \n3  amounts to deliberate indifference to the Reunification Subclassโs constitutional rights.  \n4  As a result, all members of the Reunification Subclass are being deprived, or are at \n5  unreasonable risk of being deprived, of their liberty interests, privacy interests and \n6  associational rights conferred on them by the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment to \n7  the United States Constitution not to be deprived of child-parent or child-sibling family \n8  relationships. \n9  250.  The Reunification Subclass has thousands of members and is therefore \n10  sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder impracticable.  \n11  251.  Named Plaintiffsโ Fifth Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n12  are common to, and typical of, all members of the Reunification Subclass.  Such common \n13  questions of fact include:  \n14  a.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of placing members of the \n15  Reunification Subclass far from their home communities;    \n16  b.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to place members of the \n17  Reunification Subclass in trial home reunification settings;  \n18  c.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to coordinate contact \n19  between members of the Reunification Class and their biological families;   \n20  d.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to make required \n21  monthly contact with the biological parents of members of the Reunification \n22  Subclass; and \n23  e.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to involve the biological \n24  parents of members of the Reunification Subclass in the case planning of those \n25  children. \n26  252.  Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n27  violate the Reunification Subclassโs rights to family integrity, guaranteed by the First, \n28  Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n47\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 48 of 51\n1  253.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n2  Reunification Subclass they seek to represent.  \n3  254.  Named Plaintiffs and the putative Reunification Subclass are represented by: \n4  a.  Attorneys employed by Coppersmith Brockelman PLC, a private law \n5  firm based in Arizona with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest \n6  litigation, including class action litigation;   \n7  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n8  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n9  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n10  action litigation; and \n11  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n12  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n13  welfare class actions nationally.  \n14  255.  The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n15  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Reunification \n16  Subclass. \n17  256.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n18  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n19  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n20  257.  Defendant Flanagan has acted or failed to act on grounds generally \n21  applicable to the Reunification Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n22  Plaintiffsโ counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the Reunification \n23  Subclass. \n24  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25  WHEREFORE, the Named Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n26  A.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \n27  B.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), \n28  Fed. R. Civ.

DCSโs and DHSโs violation of plaintiffsโ substantive rights to be free \n3  from harm and unreasonable risk of harm under the Due Process Clause of the \n4  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;  \n5  2.  DCSโs violation of the Reunification Subclassโs rights to family \n6  integrity under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n7  Constitution; \n8  3.  DCSโs and DHSโs violation of plaintiffsโ rights under 42 U.S.C. \n9  ยงยง 1396a(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and \n10  1396d(r); \n11  D.  Permanently enjoin DCS and DHS from subjecting plaintiffs to practices that \n12  violate their rights; \n13  E.  Order appropriate remedial relief to ensure DCSโs and DHSโs future \n14  compliance with their legal obligations to plaintiffs, including, but not limited to, the \n15  following: \n16  1.  Health Care Services Provided to Children in State Care.  DCS \n17  and DHS shall establish and implement practices to ensure that all members of the \n18  General Class receive the physical, mental and behavioral health services to which \n19  they are entitled under the federal substantive Due Process Clause.  Likewise, DCS \n20  and DHS shall establish and implement practices to ensure that all members of the \n21  Medicaid Subclass receive the physical, mental and behavioral health services to \n22  which they are entitled under the EPSDT provisions of the federal Medicaid Act.  \n23  2.  Availability of Necessary Resources for the Placement of \n24  Children.  DCS shall establish and implement practices to ensure a minimally \n25  adequate capacity and array of placements to meet the placement needs of the Non-\n26  Kinship Class, including foster and HCTC homes. \n27  3.  Family Contact and Visitation.  DCS shall establish and implement \n28  practices providing for minimally adequate visitation between members of the \n49\n{00152017.2 }     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 1   Filed 02/03/15   Page 50 of 51\n1  Reunification Subclass and their biological parents and siblings. DCS shall also \n2  establish and implement practices to adequately provide for siblings in the \n3  Reunification Subclass to be placed together in foster care. \n4  4.  Caseworker Investigations. DCS shall establish and implement \n5  practices providing for minimally adequate investigations into reports that members \n6  of the General Class have been abused or neglected.  \n7  5.

Monitoring/Enforcement.  The provisions of the Court order entered \n12  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) shall be monitored by a neutral expert monitor \n13  appointed by the Court.  In addition, the Court shall have continuing jurisdiction to \n14  oversee compliance with that order; \n15  F.  Award to the Named Plaintiffs the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in \n16  the prosecution of this action, including reasonable attorneysโ fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n17  ยง 1920 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, and Fed. R. of Civ. P. 23(e) and (h); and \n18  G.

(โNamed \n15 \nPlaintiffsโ), minors in the custody of the Arizona foster care system, filed a motion to \n16 \ncertify this matter as a class action with subclasses under Rule 23(b)(2).  (Doc. 234.)  \n17 \nDefendants Gregory McKay and Thomas Betlach opposed.  (Docs. 245, 248.)  And \n18 \nNamed Plaintiffs replied.  (Doc. 254.)  For the following reasons, the Court will grant the \n19 \nmotion for class certification. \n20 \nI.  BACKGROUND \n21 \n  Named Plaintiffs filed this civil rights class action on behalf of children in the \n22 \nArizona foster care custody, claiming the Arizona foster care system violates the U.S. \n23 \nConstitution and the federal Medicaid Act.  (Doc. 37.)  They allege Arizonaโs failure to \n24 \nremedy problems within its system exposed them and all other foster children to harm or \n25 \nunreasonable risk of harm while in the stateโs care, in violation of their federal rights.  \n26 \n(Id.) \n27 \n  A.  Role of Child Welfare Agencies \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 2 of 23\n \n \n \n1    โThe primary purpose of [Arizona Department of Child Safety (โDSCโ)] is to \n2  protect children.โ  A.R.S. ยง 8-451(B).  In Arizona, DSC has significant control over \n3  foster children.  It is charged with placing children in safe living environments and \n4  coordinating with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (โAHCCCSโ) and \n5  others to provide children with court-ordered healthcare and other services aimed at \n6  promoting the safety and well-being of all children.  See A.R.S. ยงยง 8-451(B)(2), (4); 8-\n7  457; 8-512.  If a juvenile court assigns custody of a removed child to DCS, the agency \n8  may subsequently place the child with a parent or relative, in a licensed foster home, \n9  therapeutic foster care, group home, or a residential treatment facility.  A.R.S. ยง 8-\n10  514(A), (B).   \n11    DCS and its subdivisions determine the eligibility and licensing procedures for \n12  foster parents and foster homes, and maintain responsibility for providing training and \n13  supervision  of  such  homes.    A.R.S.  ยงยง  8-503(A)(4)(b)-(h);  8-509;  8-516.    DCS  is \n14  responsible  for  investigating  all  allegations  and  risks  of  harm  involving  children, \n15  including those in foster homes.  See A.R.S. ยงยง 8-503(A)(4)(i); 8-453(A)(19); 8-456.  \n16  And DSC may deny an application, suspend, or revoke a foster parentโs license for \n17  violations of state statutes governing child welfare.  A.R.S. ยง 8-506. \n18    โIf  a  child  [is]  removed  from  the  childโs  home  and  placed  in  out-of-home \n19  placement, guardianship or adoptive placement, the [DCS must] make reasonable efforts \n20  to place that child with the childโs siblings or, if that is not possible, to maintain frequent \n21  visitation or other ongoing contact between the child and the childโs siblings unless a \n22  court determines . . . [either] would be contrary to the childโs or a siblingโs safety or well-\n23  being.โ  A.R.S. ยง 8-513(D).  A child in foster care also has a โright to maintain contact \n24  with friends and other relatives unless the court has determined that contact is not in the \n25  childโs best interests.โ  A.R.S. ยง 8-513(C). \n26    For all children in DCS custody, DCS collaborates with AHCCCS and others to \n27  โprovide comprehensive medical and dental care,โ A.R.S. ยง 8-512(A), and to โdetermine \n28  the  most  efficient  and  effective  way  to  provide  comprehensive  medical,  dental  and \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 3 of 23\n \n \n \n1  behavioral  health  services,  including  behavioral  health  diagnostic,  evaluation  and \n2  treatment services for children who are provided [comprehensive medical and dental] \n3  care [].โ  A.R.S. ยง 8-512(B). \n4    B.  Second Amended Complaint (โSACโ) \n5    The  53-page  SAC  contains  factual  allegations  concerning  the  existence  of \n6  uniform, statewide policies and practices in the foster care system and recounts in detail \n7  the experiences of several Named Plaintiffs who range from three to fourteen years of age \n8  in foster care custody.  (Doc. 37.)  The SAC details how the Named Plaintiffs allegedly \n9  did not receive necessary physical and/or mental healthcare, were separated from siblings \n10  who were also in the foster care system, experienced frequent relocations and school \n11  transfers, and did not receive early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment.  \n12  (Id.)  Many allegedly suffered ill-prepared, neglectful, and abusive foster parents and \n13  inattentive caseworkers.  (Id.) \n14    Named Plaintiffs claim their experiences were caused by a number of โstructural \n15  and  operational  failuresโ  which  expose  all  children  in  the  foster  care  system  to  a \n16  substantial risk of harm that โcontinue[s] to plague the stateโs child welfare system.โ  \n17  (Doc. 37 at 4.)  These failures include (1) severe shortage in physical,  mental,  and \n18  behavioral health services available to children in foster care; (2) widespread failure to \n19  conduct timely investigations of reports that children have been maltreated while in foster \n20  care custody; (3) severe shortage of family foster homes; and (4) widespread failure to \n21  engage in basic child welfare practices for maintaining family relationships.  (Id.) \n22    Two Defendants remain in this matter: (1) Director of the DSC, Gregory McKay, \n23  who  is  responsible  for  managing  the  stateโs  child  welfare  system;  and  (2)  Thomas \n24  Betlach, Director of the AHCCCS, which administers and supervises the stateโs Medicaid \n25  program.    (See  Docs.  37,  188.)    Named  Plaintiffs  maintain  these  individuals  are \n26  responsible for administering the foster care system and they have been aware of but have \n27  failed to address the problems outlined in the SAC.  (Doc. 37 at 4-5.)  Named Plaintiffs \n28  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  for  alleged  violations  of  their  substantive  due \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 4 of 23\n \n \n \n1  process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and their rights under the Medicaid \n2  statute.  (Id. at 24-45.) \n3    C.  Named Plaintiffsโ Motion \n4    Named Plaintiffs seek to certify one general class and two subclasses.  (Doc. 234 \n5  at 11-12.)1  First, Named Plaintiffs seek to assert constitutional claims on behalf of a \n6  general class of children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCS due to a report or \n7  suspicion of abuse or neglect (โGeneral Classโ).  (Id. at 11.)  Second, Named Plaintiffs \n8  seek to assert constitutional claims on behalf of a subclass of all children in the General \n9  Class who are not placed in the care of an adult relative or person who has a significant \n10  relationship with the child (โNon-Kinship Subclassโ).  (Id.)  Third, Named Plaintiffs seek \n11  to assert a statutory claim on behalf of a subclass comprised of all members of the \n12  General Class who are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment \n13  (โEPSDTโ) services under the federal Medicaid statute (โMedicaid Subclassโ).  (Id.)  \n14  This  subclass  alleges  that  AHCCCS,  the  agency  responsible  for  administering  the \n15  Medicaid  program  in  Arizona,  and  DCS,  which  provides  physical  and  dental  care \n16  services for Medicaid eligible children in foster care through an interagency agreement \n17  with  AHCCCS,  violated  the  Medicaid  statute.    (Id.  at  11-12.)    Moreover,  Named \n18  Plaintiffs seek to appoint their counsel as Class Counsel.  (Id. at 44.)  In support of their \n19  motion to certify, Named Plaintiffs submitted nearly ninety exhibits, including expert \n20  reports by multiple specialists in child welfare systems and health care services, excerpts \n21  of deposition transcripts, internal DSC documents and progress assessments, thousands of \n22  pages of documents obtained through discovery, and Named Plaintiffsโ sealed medical \n23  files.  (Docs. 238, 286.) \n24  II.  ANALYSIS \n25  Named Plaintiffsโ certification request is governed by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \n26 \n                                              \n27  1 Named Plaintiffs alleged five causes of action in this lawsuit, and they have since \nvoluntarily dismissed the fifth cause of action.  (Doc. 217.)  For the purposes of this \n28 \nmotion, Plaintiffs only seek to certify a general class and two subclasses with regard to \nthe remaining four. \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 5 of 23\n \n \n \n1  of Civil Procedure.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  Class certification is governed by Federal \n2  Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating they meet Rule \n3  23โs requirements.  Zinser v. Accufix Research Institute, Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th \n4  Cir. 2001).  District courts have broad discretion in determining whether to certify a \n5  class.  Id.   \n6  Under Rule 23(a), a party seeking certification of a class or subclass must satisfy \n7  four prerequisite requirements: (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) \n8  adequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).  If they satisfy the initial \n9  requirements,  Named  Plaintiffsโ  proposed  class  and  subclasses  must  also  satisfy  the \n10  requirements of one of the subsections of Rule 23(b), โwhich defines three different types \n11  of classes.โ  See Leyva v. Medline Ind., Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2013).  Here, \n12  Named Plaintiffs seek to certify their proposed class and subclasses pursuant to Rule \n13  23(b)(2), which requires that โthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n14  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n15  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n16  23(b)(2).   \n17  To determine whether a party has met the requirements of Rule 23, the Supreme \n18  Court in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (โWal-Martโ) explained โRule 23 does not set \n19  forth a mere pleading standard.โ  564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  A plaintiff seeking class \n20  certification must โaffirmatively demonstrate his compliance with [] Rule [23]โthat is, \n21  he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common \n22  questions of law or fact, etc.โ  Id. (emphasis in original).  โSimilarly, a party must \n23  affirmatively prove that he complies with one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b).โ  \n24  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 674 (9th Cir. 2014). \n25  Certification is proper only if โthe trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, \n26  that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.โ  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350-51.  \n27  โAlthough we have cautioned that a courtโs class-certification analysis must be โrigorousโ \n28  and may โentail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffโs underlying claim . . . , \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 6 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Rule  23  grants  courts  no  license  to  engage  in  free-ranging  merits  inquiries  at  the \n2  certification stage.โ  Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds, 568 \n3  U.S. 455, 465-66 (2013) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351).  As the Supreme Court in \n4  Amgen explained, it โtotally misapprehend[s] the essential pointโ of this case law to \n5  suggest that certification is improper unless plaintiffs are able to prove that the common \n6  question โwill be answered in their favor.โ  See id. at 468. \n7  McKay and Betlach offer a variety of arguments against certification.  McKay \n8  argues  Named  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  standing,  Named  Plaintiffs  fail  to  satisfy  the \n9  commonality and typicality requirements under Rule 23(a), and Named Plaintiffsโ request \n10  is an inappropriate injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2).  (Doc. 245 at 3.)  Betlach joins \n11  in  the  challenge  over  whether  Named  Plaintiffs  have  standing.    (Doc.  248  at  3.)  \n12  However, Betlach also argues the lawsuit is moot and opposes Named Plaintiffsโ motion \n13  to  certify  the  Medicaid  Subclass  in  this  case  for  failure  to  meet  the  commonality, \n14  typicality, and Rule 23(b)(2) requirements.  (Doc. 248 at 10-16.)  The Court will address \n15  each argument in turn. \n16    a.  Jurisdictional Issues \n17      1.  Mootness \n18    Betlach2 argues that because four of the named Named Plaintiffs (M.C-B, D.C-B, \n19  A.C-B, and J.M) have been adopted, they are no longer in foster care custody and this \n20  lawsuit should be dismissed as moot.3  (Doc. 245 at 20; Doc. 248 at 14.)  This argument \n                                              \n21 \n2 McKayโs opposition brief also implicitly raises a mootness argument.  (Doc. 245 \n22 \nat 7, 20.)  McKay attests that because the state is already making plans to eliminate the \nsubstantial risk of serious harm, there is no longer an ongoing harm to be enjoined and \n23 \nโthere is no need to order [the state of] Arizona to improve its foster-care system.โ  (Id. at \n20.)  Even though McKay cited to statistics suggesting that the state of Arizonaโs foster \n24 \ncare system has improved since the filing of the lawsuit, these statistics do not establish \nDefendants were not, are not, and will not be in violation of Plaintiffsโ federal rights.  \n25 \nMoreover,  the  merits  of  this  lawsuit  involve  whether  DSCโs  policies  and  practices \nconstitute  ongoing  constitutional  and  statutory  violations.    Thus,  DSCโs  unilateral \n26 \nallegation that DSC is well on its way to fixing each alleged constitutional and statutory \nissue does not render Plaintiffsโ claims moot. \n27 \n3  Betlach  raised  his  mootness  and  standing  arguments  in  the  context  of  the \n28 \ntypicality issue.  (Doc. 248 at 13.)  The Court will engage in a discussion of typicality \nbelow, but because standing and mootness are threshold jurisdictional issues and also \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 7 of 23\n \n \n \n1  is not persuasive.   \n2  Although four of the Named Plaintiffs have been adopted, there are still two \n3  Named  Plaintiffs  who  can  represent  the  class,  B.T.  and  B.K.    Thus,  the  mootness \n4  argument fails at the outset.  But even if all Named Plaintiffs permanently leave the foster \n5  care system, the โcapable of repetition, yet evading reviewโ exception to the mootness \n6  doctrine would apply.  See Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d 1081, 1090-92 (9th Cir. \n7  2011).  Children in the foster care system are inherently transitory.  A child could be \n8  adopted, a child could find a permanent guardian, and a child could also return to the \n9  foster care system if the adoption or guardianship does not work out.  Any of these could \n10  happen before a civil rights class action reaches judgment and because being part of the \n11  foster care system is a significant fact in this litigation, the โcapable of repetition, yet \n12  evading reviewโ exception to the mootness doctrine applies.  Thus, the Court will not \n13  dismiss this lawsuit based on mootness. \n14      2.  Standing \n15  Both McKay and Betlach challenge Named Plaintiffsโ standing.  (Doc. 245 at 3-4; \n16  Doc. 248 at 12-13.)  McKay alleges four of the Named Plaintiffs (M.C.-B., D.C.-B., \n17  A.C.-B., and J.M.) have been adopted, and he argues B.T. and B.K. have not shown \n18  โindividualized harm.โ  (Doc. 245 at 4.)  In opposing the certification of the Medicaid \n19  Subclass, Betlach also argues it is not enough to speculate that each plaintiff is โat riskโ \n20  of a violation when Named Plaintiffs have failed to offer any evidence that any of the \n21  Named Plaintiffs actually suffered an EPSDT violation.  (Doc. 248 at 14.)   \n22  To establish standing, a plaintiff must show he โ(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) \n23  that is fairly traceable to the alleged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be \n24  redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ  Spokeo v. Robbins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n25  (2016).  โTo establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an \n26  invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or \n27  imminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical.โ    Id.  at  1548.    โFor  an  injury  to  be \n28                                                                                                                                                    \ndistinct from typicality, the Court will discuss the jurisdictional arguments first. \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 8 of 23\n \n \n \n1  โparticularized,โ it โmust affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.โโ  Id. \n2  (internal citation omitted).  โA โconcreteโ injury must be โde factoโ; that is, it must \n3  actually exist.โ  Id.  โAlthough tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, . . . \n4  intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.โ  Id. at 1549 (internal citation omitted). \n5  First, McKayโs first standing argument is based on the assertion that four of the \n6  Named Plaintiffs have been adopted.  (Doc. 245 at 4.)  Although other circuit courts have \n7  found that plaintiffs not in foster care custody lack standing to pursue constitutional \n8  claims, see, e.g., 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir. 2003), this \n9  is not a sufficient basis for dismissing the entire lawsuit.  Standing exists if at least one \n10  named plaintiff meets the requirements.  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, \n11  979 (9th Cir. 2011).  Here, even if four of the six Named Plaintiffs have been adopted \n12  since the lawsuit has been filed, two Named Plaintiffs still remain.   \n13  Second,  without  identifying  specifics  to  support  his  argument,  McKay \n14  conclusorily argues the remaining two Named Plaintiffs have not shown โindividualized \n15  harm or that they have not received the services for any of the putative classes seeking \n16  certification.โ  (Doc. 245  at 4.)  However, McKayโs argument overlooks the seven pages \n17  in the SAC dedicated to outlining the injuries B.T. and B.K. personally suffered as well \n18  as  the  many  exhibits  submitted  in  support  of  Named  Plaintiffsโ  motion  which \n19  demonstrate the personal and individual harm they suffered.   \n20  For example, B.K. is a twelve-year-old girl who has spent more than half of her \n21  life in state foster care.  (Doc. 37 at 6.)  She was removed from her motherโs home and \n22  placed in state foster care custody multiple times.  (Id.)  When B.K. came into state care \n23  for a third time, B.K. had bruises on her head from abuse by her mother, and she was \n24  diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, a mood disorder, psychosis, and anxiety.  \n25  (Id.)  The state separated B.K. from all of her siblings and placed her in a group home on \n26  โemergency  shelterโ  status.    (Id.)    Although  this  was  supposed  to  be  a  short-term \n27  placement, B.K. remained in a group home for more than two years.  (Id. at 6-7.)  While \n28  in  state  custody  at  a  group  home,  the  state  child  welfare  agency  failed  to  do  the \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 9 of 23\n \n \n \n1  following: (1) ensure she obtained glasses that she needed to see properly; (2) discover \n2  she was walking with a limp; (3) make sure she received the shoes she needed; (4) make \n3  sure she got to see a dentist for a toothache she had for multiple months; (5) ensure she \n4  received necessary mental health services especially when she said she heard voices were \n5  telling her to hurt people or that someone would die; (6) ensure she would be able to get \n6  to her health appointments; and (7) ensure she received undisrupted services.  (Id. at 7-8.)  \n7  These facts indicate B.K. personally suffered harm from not receiving a variety of health \n8  care services, from being placed in a group home away from her siblings, and from not \n9  receiving the EPDST services in a prompt manner.  Thus, B.K. has shown she suffered \n10  individualized and personal harm sufficient to establish standing for the General Class, \n11  the Non-Kinship Subclass, and the Medicaid Subclass.  \n12    Similarly, B.T. is a sixteen-year-old boy who has spent half his life in Arizonaโs \n13  foster care custody.  (Id. at 11.)  B. T. had been shuffled through multiple institutional \n14  settings,  separated  from  his  sibling  and  denied  sibling  visitation,  and  deprived  of \n15  necessary mental health care.  (Id. at 11-15.)  B.T. also attempted suicide multiple times.  \n16  (Id. at 15.)  A month after being taken into state foster care, B.T. had a psychological \n17  evaluation indicating he needed therapeutic treatment, but he had to wait six months \n18  before his first therapy session.  (Id. at 11.)  A few months after being placed in state \n19  foster care with one of his brothers, B.T. was removed from the group home, separated \n20  from his brother, and placed into a kinship foster home with a paternal aunt.  (Id. at 12.)  \n21  He spent six months in his kinship foster home with a paternal aunt before any visits with \n22  his older brothers.  (Id.)   \n23  Over the course of a decade, B.T. was denied health care services, separated from \n24  his siblings, and denied EPDST services numerous times.  In August 2006, B.T.โs aunt \n25  told the state child welfare agency B.T. was not receiving the counseling he needed and \n26  requested an updated psychological evaluation.  (Id.)  But none was conducted.  (Id.)  \n27  When his aunt told the agency that she could no longer care for B.T. because they were \n28  not providing him with the mental health evaluation and services he needed, the agency \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 10 of 23\n \n \n \n1  moved B.T. to an emergency foster home rather than providing those services.  (Id.)   \n2  In  October  2006,  B.T.  was  temporarily  placed  with  a  foster  family  and  he \n3  threatened to kill himself and his temporary foster family.  (Id.)  Yet, he still did not \n4  receive regular therapy.  (Id.)  Instead the agency only responded by removing the six-\n5  year-old B.T. from the home and placing him in a group home.  (Id.)  The state child \n6  welfare agency received reports that B.T. was struggling emotionally in the group home.  \n7  (Id.)  Even after another psychological evaluation was requested for B.T., the state did \n8  not schedule it until months later and did not provide him with any counseling in the \n9  interim.  (Id.)  An evaluation indicated he needed individual therapy and prescribed \n10  psychotropic medication.  (Id.)  A psycho-educational evaluation was recommended but \n11  never conducted.  (Id.)   \n12  Just a month after B.T. was placed in a pre-adoptive home with one of his brothers \n13  in  January  2008,  the  family  reported  to  the  state  B.T.โs  need  for  more  intensive \n14  counseling and a more suitable counselor.  (Id.)  B.T. and his brother were adopted in \n15  August 2008, but taken back to state foster care in March 2011.  (Id. at 13.)  Shortly after \n16  this happened, B.T. reported his adoptive father had beat him with a belt, and the state \n17  immediately separated B.T. from his brother, placing the two boys in different non-\n18  therapeutic group homes.  (Id.)  The group home reported B.T. needed counseling, but he \n19  did not receive any counseling while at this group home.  (Id.)  Within a month of being \n20  back in the stateโs foster care system, B.T. was hospitalized in an acute care mental health \n21  facility for two weeks, and the state returned B.T. back to the group home after the \n22  hospitalization.    (Id.)    B.T.โs  mental  health  then  worsened,  he  was  approved  for  a \n23  therapeutic Home Care Training to Home Care Client (โHCTCโ) placement, but one was \n24  not available for him.  (Id.)  B.T. then ran away, spent a night at a juvenile detention \n25  center, and then moved to a new group home hours away from his prior placement \n26  because his prior group home had already filled his bed with another child.  (Id.)   \n27  In July 2011, B.T. was moved to a HCTC home, but did not receive trauma \n28  therapy and did not receive a psycho-sexual evaluation until October 2011.  (Id.)  When \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 11 of 23\n \n \n \n1  the state finally began looking for a HCTC placement for B.T. six months later, the state \n2  was unable to find one and moved him to a non-therapeutic group home/shelter in August \n3  2012.  (Id.)  He threatened to kill himself three times while in this non-therapeutic \n4  congregate care placement.  (Id. at 14.)  When the shelter reported to the state that B.T. \n5  needed a higher level of care in November 2012, the state moved him the following \n6  month to a therapeutic group home.  (Id.)  But when B.T.โs suicidal thoughts continued, \n7  the state moved him back to the earlier non-therapeutic group home/shelter in January \n8  2013.  (Id.)   \n9  In June 2013, B.T. had another incident where he grabbed the steering wheel of a \n10  van driven by group home staff and said โI want us all to die.โ  (Id.)  On that same day, \n11  the stateโs therapeutic team overseeing his health services reported the following: โwith a \n12  few exceptions, B.T. is doing well over the last 2 weeks.โ  (Id.)  After this suicide \n13  attempt, B.T.โs psychiatrist recommended he be placed in a residential treatment facility.  \n14  (Id.)    While  the  request  was  pending,  the  state  moved  him  to  the  following:  (1)  a \n15  therapeutic group home far away, (2) another therapeutic group home in September 2013, \n16  (3) a non-therapeutic family foster home in March 2014, (4) a non-therapeutic foster \n17  home in July 2014, (5) a shelter in October 2014, and (6) another therapeutic group home \n18  even though he received approval for a therapeutic HCTC placement in November 2014.  \n19  (Id. at 14-15.)  Up until September 2014, he had one therapy session, and he threatened to \n20  commit suicide again in December 2014.  (Id.) \n21  These facts indicate B.T. personally suffered harm from not receiving a variety of \n22  health care services (including physical and mental health services), from being placed in \n23  a group home away from his siblings, and from not receiving the EPDST services in a \n24  prompt manner.  Thus, B.T. has shown he suffered sufficient personal harm to establish \n25  standing for the General Class, the Non-Kinship Subclass, and the Medicaid Subclass.  \n26  Third, Betlach alleges B.T. and B.K. have not alleged harm as a result of being \n27  deprived of their rights under the Medicaid statute.  (Doc. 248 at 14.)  A district court \n28  โmust determine that at least one named class representative has Article III standing to \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 12 of 23\n \n \n \n1  raise each class subclaim.โ  Prado-Steinman ex rel. Prado v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1279.  \n2  However, as discussed above, B.T. and B.K. presented evidence they personally suffered \n3  harm from not receiving the necessary health care diagnostic services and treatment \n4  necessary to correct physical and mental conditions in a prompt manner.  Thus, B.T. and \n5  B.K. have standing to challenge whether the DSCโs and the AHCCCSโs policies and \n6  practices violate the Medicaid statute, and the Court will not dismiss this case based on \n7  standing. \n8  b.  Class Certification \n9  Defendants McKay and Betlach do not dispute that Named Plaintiffs meet the \n10  requirements of numerosity and adequacy of representation (see Doc. 245 at 1; Doc. \n11  248), and the Court also agrees Named Plaintiffs have satisfied their burdens with regard \n12  to  these  prerequisites.    Defendants  argue  Named  Plaintiffs  have  not  satisfied  the \n13  commonality and typicality prerequisites as well as the requirements under Rule 23(b)(2).  \n14  The Court will analyze each but will focus its analysis on the prerequisites in dispute. \n15      1.  Numerosity under Rule 23(a)(1) \n16     Rule 23(a)(1) requires the proposed class be โso numerous that joinder of all \n17  members is impracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  There is no specific number that \n18  satisfies the numerosity requirement.  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw., Inc. v. Equal Empโt \n19  Opportunity Commโn, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  Here, Named Plaintiffs have produced \n20  evidence indicating that in 2016 there were over 18,000 children in the General Class, \n21  over  10,000  children  in  the  Non-Kinship  Subclass,  and  over  17,000  children  in  the \n22  Medicaid Subclass.  (Doc. 238-1, Ex. 31 at DSC-00132510, Ex. 32 at AH 0000673, Ex. \n23  33 at DSC-00121026.)  Defendants do not contest this issue, and the Court finds this \n24  prerequisite has been satisfied. \n25    2.  Commonality under Rule 23(b)(2) \n26    Rule 23(a)(2) requires there be โquestions of law or fact common to the class.โ  \n27  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This provision requires plaintiffs โdemonstrate that the class \n28  members โhave suffered the same injury,โโ not merely violations of โthe same provision \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 13 of 23\n \n \n \n1  of law.โ  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (internal citation omitted).  Commonality is satisfied \n2  where plaintiffโs claims depend on a โcommon contentionโ that is โcapable of classwide \n3  solutionโwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that \n4  is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โ  Id.  โWhat matters to \n5  class certification . . . is not the raising of common โquestionsโโeven in drovesโbut, \n6  rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive \n7  the resolution of the litigation.โ  Id. (internal citation omitted).  \n8    Post-Wal-Mart, the Ninth Circuit recognized โPlaintiffs need not show that every \n9  question  in  the  case,  or  even  a  preponderance  of  questions,  is  capable of classwide \n10  resolution.โ  Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 544 (9th Cir. 2013).  \n11  โWhere the circumstances of each particular class member vary but retain a common core \n12  of factual or legal issues with the rest of class, commonality exists.โ  Evon v. Law Offices \n13  of  Sidney  Mickell,  688  F.3d  1015,  1029  (9th  Cir.  2012)  (internal  citation  omitted).  \n14  Specifically, members of the proposed class need not share every single fact in common \n15  but  โcommon  questions  may  center  on  โshared  legal  issues  with  divergent  factual \n16  predicates or a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies.โโ  \n17  Jimenez  v.  Allstate  Ins.  Co.,  765  F.3d  1161,  1165  (9th  Cir.  2014)  (internal  citation \n18  omitted).  โTo assess whether the putative class members share a common question, . . . \n19  we must identify the elements of the class membersโ[] case-in-chief.โ  Parsons, 754 F.3d \n20  at 676 (internal citation omitted).   \n21        a.  Claims at Issue for Class Certification \n22    In the Named Plaintiffsโ case, the state functions as the de facto parent of a child \n23  in foster care.  Tamas v. Depโt of Social & Health Servs., 630 F.3d 833, 843 (9th Cir. \n24  2010); see also Taylor ex rel. Walker v. Ledbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 795 (11th Cir. 1987) (en \n25  banc) (โThe stateโs action in assuming the responsibility of finding and keeping the \n26  [foster]  child  in  a  safe  environment  placed  an  obligation  on  the  state  to  insure  the \n27  continuing safety of that environment.โ)  Here, Named Plaintiffs seek to pursue three \n28  constitutional substantive due process claims through the General Class and the Non-\n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 14 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Kinship Subclass.  (Doc. 234 at 11.)  Specifically, DSCโs practices deprived the General \n2  Class of their right to adequate and timely physical, dental, and mental health care (Cause \n3  of Action I) and to timely investigations into allegations of abuse and neglect while in the \n4  stateโs custody (Cause of Action III).  (Id.)  And DSCโs practices deprived the General \n5  Class of their right to placement in a living environment that protects their physical, \n6  mental, and emotional safety, and well-being (Cause of Action IV).  (Id.)  Because these \n7  claims arise as constitutional substantive due process claims, the Court will discuss these \n8  claims together when analyzing the commonality prerequisite.  Further, Named Plaintiffs \n9  also pursue a statutory claim through the Medicaid Subclass, alleging the practices of the \n10  DSC and the AHCCCS deprived the Medicaid Subclass of early and periodic screening, \n11  diagnostic, and treatment services required under the federal Medicaid statute.  (Id.)   \n12         b.  Constitutional Substantive Due Process Claims  \n13    First, to establish a due process claim, state officials must act with such deliberate \n14  indifference to the liberty interest that their actions โshock the conscience.โ  Tamas, 630 \n15  F.3d at 844.  Conduct that โshocks the conscienceโ is โdeliberate indifference to a known \n16  or so obvious as to imply knowledge of danger.โ  Id. (internal citation omitted).  โ[T]he \n17  deliberate indifference standard, as applied to foster children, requires a showing of an \n18  objectively substantial risk of harm and a showing that the officials were subjectively \n19  aware of facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious \n20  harm existed and that either the official actually drew that inference or that a reasonable \n21  official would have been compelled to draw that inference.โ  Id. at 845 (concluding the \n22  โanalysis [in the foster care context] is identical to the subjective deliberate indifference \n23  component [ ] articulated in prisoner cases and includes by implication the objective \n24  component requiring the existence of a substantial risk of serious harmโ). \n25    Here,  Named  Plaintiffs  identified  several  state-wide  practices  affecting  the \n26  proposed  General  Class:  failure  to  provide  timely  access  to  health  care  (including \n27  comprehensive evaluations, timely annual visits, semi-annual preventative dental health \n28  care, adequate health assessments, and complete immunizations); failure to coordinate the \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 15 of 23\n \n \n \n1  delivery of physical and dental care services; ineffective coordination and monitoring of \n2  physical and dental services by DCS; DCSโs overuse of congregate care for children with \n3  unmet  mental  health  needs;  excessive  DCS  caseworker  caseloads;  failure  to  initiate \n4  investigations in a timely manner after reports of abuse; failure to document a timely \n5  โsafety assessmentโ after initiating an investigation; failure to meet deadline for closing \n6  investigations; and delays in important investigative steps.  (Doc. 234 at 26-27.) \n7    Based  on  these  policies  and  practices,  Named  Plaintiffs  assert  that  common \n8  questions capable of resolution on a classwide basis involve questions including whether \n9  DCSโs practices subject the General Class to a substantial risk of harm in violation of \n10  Fourteenth Amendment rights by (1) failing to provide physical and dental health care, \n11  (2) failing to provide mental and behavioral health care, or (3) failing to conduct timely \n12  investigations into reports when children have been abused or neglected while in foster \n13  care.  (Doc. 234 at 17.)   \n14    Named Plaintiffs also identified the following practices affecting the Non-Kinship \n15  Subclass: DCSโs excessive use of emergency shelters and group homes, unnecessary \n16  separation of siblings, and placement of children far from home.  (Doc. 234 at 31-35; \n17  Doc. 254 at 15.)  Based on these practices, Named Plaintiffs contend there are common \n18  questions regarding whether DSCโs practices (1) subject Non-Kinship Subclass members \n19  to a substantial risk of harm in violation of substantive due process; (2) fail to maintain an \n20  adequate number of foster home placements; (3) place children in appropriate settings \n21  (e.g., shelters or congregate placements) resulting in physical and psychological harm; (4) \n22  improperly  separates  children  from  siblings;  and  (5)  place  children  far  from  home \n23  communities making visits from biological family difficult.  (Doc. 234 at 32.) \n24    McKay and Betlach argue that commonality is not met in this action because โthe \n25  diversity of needs of children in care require[s] an individual determination.โ  (Doc. 245 \n26  at  4;  see  also  Doc.  248  at  11.)    While  one  childโs  medical  diagnosis  or  placement \n27  assessment may differ from the next, the deliberate indifference standard involves Named \n28  Plaintiffs showing an objective substantial risk of harm based on the stateโs policies and \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 16 of 23\n \n \n \n1  practices and the officialsโ subjective awareness of their risk.  Specifically, central to \n2  each claim is whether children in state foster care custody are exposed to statewide \n3  practices governing overall conditions of health care services or placement decisions \n4  resulting  in  a  substantial  risk  of  serious  future  harm  to  which  the  defendants  were \n5  deliberately  indifferent.    Here,  Named  Plaintiffs  correctly  identified  that  the  Ninth \n6  Circuitโs opinion in Parsons is instructive for the commonality analysis.   \n7    In  Parsons,  the  Ninth  Circuit  upheld  a  district  courtโs  order  granting  class \n8  certification where plaintiffs sued the Arizona Department of Corrections (โADCโ) for \n9  mass deficiencies and outlined a number of specific, uniform, statewide policies and \n10  practices that exposed all ADC inmates to a substantial risk of harm.  Parsons, 754 F.3d \n11  at 662.  The Ninth Circuit found all ADC inmates were exposed to โspecified statewide \n12  ADC policies and practices that govern the overall conditions of health care services and \n13  confinement,โ and this exposure resulted in โa substantial risk of serious future harm to \n14  which the defendants were deliberately indifferent.โ  Id. at 678.  The Ninth Circuit also \n15  found the identified practices were โthe โglueโ that h[e]ld[] together the putative class . . . \n16  either each of the policies and practices is unlawful as to every inmate or it is not.โ  Id. \n17    Similar to Parsons, the putative class and subclass members here also set forth \n18  numerous common contentions whose truth or falsity can be determined in one stroke:  \n19  whether the specified statewide policies and practices to which they are all subjected by \n20  the DSC expose them to a substantial risk of harm.  Here, Named Plaintiffs identified \n21  several statewide practices that affect the General Class and Non-Kinship Subclass. \n22    The inquiry here does not require the Court to determine the effect of the policies \n23  and practices upon any individual class member (or class members) or to undertake an \n24  individualized determination.  Even if health issues may differ, every child in the DSC \n25  custody is necessarily subject to the same medical, mental health, and dental care policies \n26  and practices of the DSC in the same way that the inmates in Parsons were subjected to \n27  the policies and practices of the ADC.  Any one child could easily fall ill, be injured, \n28  need treatment, require a diagnostic, need emergency care, crack a tooth, or require \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 17 of 23\n \n \n \n1  mental health treatment.  And any child in the foster care system would be subjected to \n2  the DSCโs policies regarding placement decisions.  Thus, every single child in the foster \n3  care system faces a substantial risk of serious harm if DSC policies and practices fail to \n4  adhere to constitutional requirements.  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 679.   \n5         c.  Statutory Claim under the Medicaid Act \n6    Under the Medicaid Act, a state must have a plan for medical assistance that \n7  provides for EPSDT services for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง \n8  1396a(a)(10)(A);  1396d(a)(4)(B);  1396a(a)(43);  1396d(r).    EPSDT  services  refer  to \n9  screening, medical, vision, dental, and hearing services as well as other necessary health \n10  treatment services.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396d(r)(1)-(5); 1396a(a)(43)(C).  Children in state \n11  foster  care  are  eligible  beneficiaries  of  Medicaid  services.    42  U.S.C.  ยง \n12  1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I).4  Thus, Medicaid-eligible children in foster care have a right to \n13  EPSDT services and the state Medicaid agency, such as AHCCCS, has โan obligation to \n14  see  that  the  services  are  provided  when  screening  reveals  that  they  are  medically \n15  necessary for a child.โ  Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1158 \n16  (9th Cir. 2007). \n17    Named  Plaintiffs  identified  several  statewide  practices  affecting  the  proposed \n18  Medicaid  Subclass:  excessive  DCS  caseworker  caseloads,  ineffective  coordination  of \n19  mental and behavioral health care between DCS and AHCCCS contractors, AHCCCS \n20  contractorsโ  incomplete  and  out-of-date  service  plans,  ineffective  coordination  and \n21  monitoring of physical and dental services by DCS, shortage of therapeutic foster care \n22  placements  and  services  maintained  by  AHCCCS  and  DCS,  shortage  of  residential \n23  treatment  center  placements  maintained  by  AHCCCS,  shortage  of  behavioral  health \n24  providers maintained by AHCCCS, and DCSโs overuse of congregate care for children \n                                              \n25 \n4  According  to  the  SAC,  Arizona  has  an  EPSDT  Periodicity  Schedule  which \n26 \ndescribes when certain health examinations and services need to be provided, and DCS \nand AHCCCS have policies requiring examinations and services in specific situations.  \n27 \n(Doc. 37 at 32-34.)  Named Plaintiffs do not appear to challenge the written policies, but \nrather  conclude  through  personal  experiences  and  expert  findings  that  the  DCS  and \n28 \nAHCCCSโs actual practices did not comply with the written policies.  Thus, Named \nPlaintiffs challenge the routine practice of failing to provide statutorily required services.  \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 18 of 23\n \n \n \n1  with unmet mental health needs.  (Doc. 254 at 11; see also Doc. 234 at 13-27.)   \n2    Based on these practices, Named Plaintiffs assert there are common questions as \n3  to  whether  these  practices  by  AHCCCS  and  DCS  (1)  failed  to  provide  timely  and \n4  adequate  access  to  preventative  medical,  dental,  and  mental  health  screening  and \n5  diagnostic services; (2) failed to coordinate care to ensure timely medically necessary \n6  physical, dental, and mental health treatment to address healthcare needs; and (3) failed \n7  to build and maintain an adequate capacity and infrastructure of mental health providers \n8  and  therapeutic  placements  to  assure  that  mental  health  needs  are  timely  addressed.  \n9  (Doc. 234 at 29). \n10    Similar to the constitutional claims, central to the claim here is the question of \n11  whether practices by DSC and AHCCCS failed to adhere to the Medicaid statute.  Even if \n12  a childโs specific medical diagnosis may differ, however, whether the foster care systemโs \n13  practices  establish  a  pattern  of  non-compliance  arise  from  statewide  policies  and \n14  practices by DSC and AHCCCS.   \n15    Betlach argues that with regard to the Medicaid Subclass, Named Plaintiffs failed \n16  to meet the commonality requirement because โthey woefully fail to offer any evidence \n17  that  AHCCCS  has  actually  violated  the  EPSDT  provisions.โ    (Doc.  248  at  11-12.)  \n18  However, โ[m]erits questions may be considered to the extentโbut only to the extentโ\n19  that  they  are  relevant  to  determining  whether  the  Rule  23  prerequisites  for  class \n20  certification are satisfied.โ  Amgen, 568 U.S. at 466; see also Stockwell v. City & Cty. of \n21  San Francisco, 749 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that the opinion in Amgen \n22  demonstrates commonality does not require showing the putative class will prevail on \n23  whatever common questions it identifies); Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, \n24  669 F.3d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 2012) (โ[T]he court should not turn the class certification \n25  proceedings into a dress rehearsal for the trial on the merits.โ); Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983 n.8 \n26  (emphasizing  โwhether  class  members  could  actually  prevail  on  the  merits  of  their \n27  claimsโ is not a proper inquiry in determining โwhether common questions existโ).5  \n                                              \n28 \n5 In any case, Named Plaintiffsโ briefing and expert reports offer reliability and \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 19 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Thus, Named Plaintiffs satisfy the commonality requirement. \n2    3.  Typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) \n3    Rule 23(a)(3) requires that โthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are \n4  typical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P 23(a)(3).  A named \n5  plaintiffโs claims are typical of the class under Rule 23(a)(3) if they are โreasonably \n6  coextensive  with  those  of  the  absent  class  members;  they  need  to  be  substantially \n7  identical.โ  Torres v. Mercer Canyons, Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1141 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation \n8  omitted).  The Ninth Circuit in Parsons stated that this test is met where the named \n9  plaintiffs demonstrate their โinjury is a result of a course of conduct that is not unique to \n10  any of them,โ and they allege that their โinjury follows from the course of conduct at the \n11  center of the class claims.โ  754 F.3d at 685. \n12    Here, B.T. and B.K. are children in DSC custody.  It is alleged that both of them \n13  have been and are exposed to a substantial risk of serious harm by the challenged DSC \n14  and AHCCCS policies and practices.  Thus, the Named Plaintiffs allege โthe same or [a] \n15  similar injuryโ as the rest of the putative class; they allege this injury is a result of a \n16  course of conduct that is not unique to any of them and the injury follows from the cause \n17  of conduct at the center of the class claims.  Since every child in the foster care system \n18  under state custody is highly likely to require medical care and housing placement, each \n19  Named Plaintiff is similarly positioned to all other children with respect to exposure to \n20  the Defendantsโ policies and practices.  In Parsons, the Ninth Circuit explicitly rejected \n21  arguments in this context about how named plaintiffs may have in the past suffered \n22  varying injuries or how they may currently have different health care needs.  Parsons, \n23  754 F.3d at 686.  The Court held Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that their claims be โtypicalโ \n24  of the class and not that they be identically positioned to each other or to every class \n25 \n                                                                                                                                                  \n26 \nsignificant information to show state-wide practices exist.  Although it is not necessary to \nassess the merits of whether Defendants violated the Medicaid Act beyond the question \n27 \nof class certification, Plaintiffs also offer evidence showing DCS and AHCCCS violated \nPlaintiffsโ statutory rights by failing to do the following: (1) detect and treat medical and \n28 \ndental needs, (2) provide annual well-child physicals, (3) provide semi-annual dental \ncheck-ups, and (4) provide timely immunizations.  (Reply at 5-10.) \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 20 of 23\n \n \n \n1  member.  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 985 n.9 (finding that typicality is not defeated by different \n2  factual scenarios when they result in a claim of the same nature).  Thus, Named Plaintiffs \n3  satisfy typicality.  \n4    4.  Adequacy of Representation under Rule 23(a)(4) \n5    Rule 23(a)(4) requires the โrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect \n6  the interestsโ of each of the classes that Named Plaintiffs seek to certify.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n7  23(a)(4).    To  determine  whether  this  prerequisite  is  satisfied,  the  court  asks  two \n8  questions: (1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with \n9  other class members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the \n10  action vigorously on behalf of the class?โ  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, \n11  1020 (9th Cir. 1998).  Here, the Named Plaintiffs and their counsel do not have conflicts \n12  of interest with other class members since Named Plaintiffs seek to improve structural \n13  deficiencies that affect children in DCS custody.  And Named Plaintiffs assert they will \n14  continue to prosecute this action vigorously on behalf of each class member.  Defendants \n15  also do not contest this issue.  Thus, this requirement is satisfied. \n16    5.  Injunctive and Declaratory Relief under Rule 23(b)(2) \n17    Certification under this rule requires that โthe party opposing the class has acted or \n18  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n19  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  Fed. R. \n20  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2)โs primary role is the certification of civil rights cases like \n21  this  one.    Parsons,  754  F.3d  at  688  (stating  Rule  23(b)(2)โs  requirements  are \n22  โunquestionably  satisfiedโ  when  the  putative  class  seeks  โuniform  injunctive  or \n23  declaratory relief from policies or practices that are generally applicable to the class as a \n24  wholeโ).  \n25    Courts have invoked Rule 23(b)(2) to certify classes of foster children seeking \n26  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  for  alleged  widespread  violations  in  the  foster  care \n27  system.  See, e.g., Marisol A. v. Guiliani, 126 F.3d 372, 378 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming \n28  class certification on behalf of a class of Medicaid-eligible foster children); DG ex rel. \n \n- 20 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 21 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2010) (affirming the district courtโs \n2  finding  that  the  proposed  class  satisfied  Rule  23(b)(2)โs  โgenerally  applicableโ  and \n3  cohesiveness requirements). \n4    Defendants argue this requirement has not been met because the remedies sought \n5  by Named Plaintiffs are โtoo abstractโ and are so generic that relief could be afforded to \n6  every class member only if the Court tailored an injunction as to each one.  (Doc. 245 at \n7  7; Doc. 248 at 15.)  However, Named Plaintiffsโ claims challenge Defendantsโ common \n8  set of policies and practices involving health care services and the placement of children \n9  in the foster care system.  And although Betlach contends certification of the Medicaid \n10  Subclass will implicate individualized adjudications, Named Plaintiffs are claiming that \n11  Defendantsโ policies are impermissible under the statuteโnot that a specific plaintiff \n12  should have received a particular diagnosis or treatment instead of another.  See Perez-\n13  Olano v. Gonzalez, 248 F.R.D. 248, 259 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (finding the Rule 23(b)(2) \n14  requirements met when the legality of defendantsโ conduct involved defendantsโ common \n15  set of policies that are applied to a category of in-custody minors).  In other words, the \n16  harm Named Plaintiffs seek to remedy is the โrisk of exposureโ created by subjecting \n17  children in foster care to DSCโs and AHCCCSโs policies and practicesโnot the harm an \n18  individual child suffers from a misdiagnosis.  Thus, this requirement is satisfied. \n19    c.  Appointment of Counsel \n20    Named Plaintiffs seek to appoint Perkins Coie LLP, Arizona Center for Law in the \n21  Public Interest, and Childrenโs Rights, Inc. as class counsel.  (Doc. 37 at 35; Doc. 234 at \n22  44.)  Class counsel must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  Fed. R. \n23  Civ. P. 26(g)(4).  In appointing class counsel, the court must consider: (i) the work \n24  counsel  has  done  in  identifying  or  investigating  potential  claims  in  the  action;  (ii) \n25  counselโs experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of \n26  claims asserted in the action; (iii) counselโs knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the \n27  resources  that  counsel  will  commit  to  representing  the  class.    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n28  26(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv).  The Court may also consider anything else โpertinent to counselโs \n \n- 21 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 22 of 23\n \n \n \n1  ability to fairly adequately represent the interests of the classโ and โmay order potential \n2  class counsel to provide information on any subject pertinent to the appointment and to \n3  propose terms for attorneyโs fees and nontaxable costs.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B)-(C).  \n4  Rule 23(g) also instructs, โ[i]f more than one adequate applicant seeks appointment, the \n5  court must appoint the applicant best able to represent the interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. \n6  Civ. P. 23(g)(2).   \n7    Named Plaintiffs seek the appointment of a law firm and two legal organizations \n8  as class counsel.  (Doc. 234 at 44.)  Despite the strictures of Rule 23(g), given the size of \n9  the proposed class, it is not unreasonable to appoint multiple counsel in this case.  Here, \n10  Plaintiffsโ counsel satisfies the four requirements under Rule 26(g)(4).  First, counsel \n11  conducted an exhaustive investigation the Arizona child welfare system, safety, health, \n12  and well-being of children in DSC custody.  (Doc. 234 at 44.)  Counsel interviewed \n13  dozens  of  stakeholders  across  the  state  and  spent  hundreds  of  hours  obtaining  and \n14  reviewing relevant information.  (Id.)  Second, counsel also have a wealth of experience \n15  in complex litigation and in representing children in the custody of state child welfare \n16  systems.  (Id.)  Third, counsel are well-versed and have extensive experience in the law \n17  and claims at issue here and have handled numerous civil rights lawsuits in federal court.  \n18  (Id.)    Fourth,  counsel  are  prepared  to  continue  funding  this  litigation  through  its \n19  resolution and will continue to dedicate the resources required to zealously represent the \n20  class and subclasses of children.  (Id.; Docs. 235, 236, 237.)  Moreover, McKay and \n21  Betlach do not object to the appointment of counsel.  (See Doc. 245 at 1 n.3.)  Thus, the \n22  Court will appoint Named Plaintiffsโ counsel as class counsel. \n23    Accordingly, \n24    IT IS ORDERED Named Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification (Doc. 234) is \n25  GRANTED in part.  The Court certifies the General Class, the Non-Kinship Subclass, \n26  and the Medicaid Subclass as follows: \n27    General Class: All children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCS due to a \n28  report or suspicion of abuse or neglect. \n \n- 22 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 363   Filed 09/30/17   Page 23 of 23\n \n \n \n1    Non-Kinship Subclass: All members in the General Class who are not placed in \n2  the care of an adult relative or person who has a significant relationship with the child. \n3    Medicaid Subclass: All members of the General Class who are entitled to early \n4  and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services under the federal Medicaid \n5  statute. \n6    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  Named  Plaintiffs  B.K.,  by  her  next  friend \n7  Margaret Tinsley, and B.T. , by his next friend Jennifer Kupiswzewski, are appointed as \n8  Class Representatives for the General Class, the Non-Kinship Subclass, and the Medicaid \n9  Subclass. \n10    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Named Plaintiffsโ request to appoint Perkins Coie \n11  LLP, Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest, and Childrenโs Rights, Inc. as Class \n12  Counsel is GRANTED. \n13    Dated this 29th day of September, 2017. \n14   \n15   \n16 \nHonorable Roslyn O.

The  district  court  certified  a \nGeneral Class of all children who are or will be in the \nDepartment of Child Safetyโs custody due to a report or \nsuspicion of abuse or neglect.  The district court further \ncertified  two  subclasses:    (1)  a  Non-Kinship  Subclass \nconsisting of members in the General class who are not \nplaced in the care of an adult relative or person with a \nsignificant relationship with the child; and (2) a Medicaid \nSubclass consisting of all members of the General class who \nwere entitled to services under the federal Medicaid statute.\n**This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 4 of 49\n4 B.K.V.SNYDER\nAffirming the district courtโs certification of the General \nClass, the panel first held that class representative B.K. had \nstanding to press her due process claims given that she has \nserious medical diagnoses, presented evidence that she has \nnot  received  adequate  medical  care  or  appropriate \nplacements in the past and presented evidence of a risk of \nsimilar future harms.  The panel then held that the district \ncourt did not err or abuse its discretion in its ruling that the \nclass  had  commonality  and  typicality  and  that  uniform \ninjunctive relief was available.  The panel concluded that the \ndistrict  court  properly  grounded  its  commonality \ndetermination in the constitutionality of statewide policies \nand practices that could be properly litigated in a class \nsetting.  Addressing the typicality requirement, the panel \nheld that B.K. had demonstrated with evidence that she was \nsubject to statewide policies and practices that applied to \nevery member of the class.  Finally, the panel held that a \nsingle, indivisible injunction ordering state officials to abate \nthose policies and practices would provide relief to each \nmember of the class, thus satisfying Rule 23(b)(2).\nAffirming the district courtโs certification of the Non-\nKinship Subclass, the panel held that B.K. had standing to \nbring the subclassโs due process claims.  The panel then held \nthat  by  identifying  certain  statewide  practices,  such  as \nexcessive use of emergency shelters and group homes, the \ndistrict  court  satisfied  the  commonality,  typicality,  and \nuniformity of injunctive relief factors.  The panel concluded \nthat the district court would be able to determine whether \ndefendants  have  an  unconstitutional  practice  of  placing \nchildren  in  substantial  risk  of  harm  by  evaluating  these \npractices as a whole, rather than as to each individual class \nmember.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 5 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 5\nAddressing the Medicaid Subclass, the panel held that \nthe materials in the record supported B.K.โs standing.  The \npanel held that the district court abused its discretion by \ncertifying  the  Medicaid  Subclass  based  on  an  apparent \nmisconception of the legal framework for such a claim. The \npanel noted that in the due process context relevant to the \nGeneral and Non-Kinship Subclasses, proving a substantial \nrisk of harm was all that was necessary to prove a claim.  A \nclaim under the Medicaid Act, however, must be based on \nactions that actually violate the Actโs requirements.  The \npanel further determined that the district court failed to make \na factual finding that every subclass member was subject to \nan identical significant risk of a future Medicaid violation \nthat would support injunctive relief. The panel therefore \nvacated the Medicaid Subclass and remanded for further \nproceedings.\nConcurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge Adelman \nconcurred in all parts of the majorityโs opinion except the \nportion addressing the Medicaid Subclass.  Judge Adelman \nstated  that  the  answer  to  the  legal  question  of  whether \nexposure to a risk of harm violates the Medicaid statute did \nnot affect class certification in this case, where the class \nsought only injunctive relief.  Moreover, Judge Adelman \nstated  that  the  district  court  made  findings  of  fact  that \nsupported its decision to certify the Medicaid Subclass, and \nthose findings were not clearly erroneous.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 6 of 49\n6 B.K.V.SNYDER\nCOUNSEL\nRobert L.

In 2015, ten of \nthose children brought an action against the directors of \nthese  agencies  for  alleged  violations  of  the  federal \nConstitution and the Medicaid Act, alleging that Arizonaโs \nstate-wide policies and practices deprived them of required \nmedical services, among other things, and thus subjected \nthem to a substantial risk of harm. Based on these claims, the \ndistrict court certified a class of all children who are or will \nbe in the Department of Child Safetyโs custody, along with \ntwo subclasses. The Director of the Department of Child \nSafety and the Director of the Health Care Cost Containment \nSystem timely sought review of those class certification \ndecisions, and we accepted their interlocutory appeals. We \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 8 of 49\n8 B.K.V.SNYDER\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง1292, and we affirm in \npart, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.\nI.\nA.\nGregory  McKay  is  the  Director  of  the  Arizona \nDepartment of Child Safety (DCS). DCSโs primary purpose \nis to โprotect children,โ by investigating reports of abuse and \nneglect, establishing foster care placements, working with \nlaw enforcement, maintaining permanency, and providing \ntreatment  to  families.  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  (ARS)  ยง8-451. \nPursuant to DCSโs statutory framework, DCS investigates \nreports of threats to child safety and may remove children \nfrom their homes by superior court order, consent of the \nchildโs guardian, or where โclearly necessary to protect the \nchild  because  exigent  circumstances  exist.โ  ARS \nยง8-821(A),  (D).  DCS  may  also  petition  to  commence \ndependency proceedings in Arizona state court by alleging \nthat a child is dependent. ARS ยง8-841(A). On the filing of \nsuch a petition, the Arizona court may issue โtemporary \norders necessary to provide for the safety and welfare of the \nchild,โ ARS ยง8-841(F), and assumes continuing jurisdiction \nโover all matters affecting dependent children,โ In re Appeal \nin Maricopa Cty. Juvenile Action No. JD-6236, 874 P.2d \n1006, 1008 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1994). The court then holds a \ndependency  hearing  to  adjudicate  whether  the  child  is \ndependent. ARS ยง8-844. If the child is dependent, the court \nwill  typically  place  the  child  in  DCSโs  legal  custody, \ntriggering DCSโs legal obligations to the child. See, e.g.,\nOscar F. v. Depโt of Child Safety, 330 P.3d 1023, 1025 (Ariz. \nCt. App. 2014) (โSince the day after the dependency petition \nwas filed, the children have been temporary wards of the \nCourt, committed to the legal care, custody and control of \nDCSโ (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 9 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 9\nJami Snyder is Director of the Arizona Health Care Cost \nContainment  System  (AHCCCS).  AHCCCS  administers \nArizonaโs  Medicaid  program,  which  provides  medical \nservices to various categories of individuals within the state. \nMedicaid is โa cooperative federal-state program through \nwhich the federal government provides financial assistance \nto states so that they can furnish medical care tolow-income \nindividuals.โ Cal. Assโn of Rural Health Clinics v. Douglas,\n738  F.3d  1007,  1010  (9th  Cir.  2013).  Among  those \nindividuals are foster children within the stateโs care. See \n42U.S.C.  ยง1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I).  Medicaid  is  jointly \nfinanced  by  the  federal  and  state  governments  and  is \nadministered by state governments through state โplans,โ \nwhich are approved by the federal Secretary of Health and \nHuman  Services.  Cal.  Assโn  of  Rural  Health  Clinics,\n738F.3d at 1010. Once a state joins the Medicaid system, it \nmust  comply  with  federal  statutory  and  regulatory \nrequirements to ensure that its plan provides all required \nhealthcare services. Id. These requirements may be court-\nenforced  through  a  private  claim  by  eligible  Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, when such a claim exists. Id. at 1013. We refer \nto McKay and Snyder collectively as โthe Directorsโ unless \nthe context otherwise requires, without losing sight of their \nunique  statutory  duties  and  the  distinct  claims  asserted \nagainst each.\nThe  ten  original  plaintiffs  in this  case  were  foster \nchildren  in  Arizonaโs  care.  They  initiated  this  action  in \nFebruary 2015, alleging that the Directors had state-wide \npolicies and practices that violated their rights to due process \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, family integrity under the \nFirst,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments,  and  medical \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 10 of 49\n10 B.K.V.SNYDER\nservices under the Medicaid Act.1 The plaintiffsโ original \ngoal was to maintain a class action with themselves as class \nrepresentatives, but over the next two-plus years of litigation \neight plaintiffs were adopted or otherwise removed from the \nfoster care system, leaving only two at the time of class \ncertification.  Since  class  certification,  moreover,  an \nadditional plaintiff appears to have aged out of the proposed \nclasses.  We  therefore  discuss  plaintiff  B.K.  as  the \nrepresentative class member.2\nB.K. alleges that that she has been deprived of necessary \nhealth care, separated from her siblings, deprived of family \ncontact, and placed in inappropriate care environments. B.K. \nalleges that these deprivations amount to violations of her \nright to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nof  her  right  to  reasonably  prompt  early  and  periodic \nscreening,  diagnostic,  and  treatment  services  (EPSDT \nservices) under the Medicaid Act. B.K. also alleges that \nthese violations are caused by specified state-wide policies \nand practices.\nB.\nIn November 2016, the named plaintiffs sought class \ncertification for a class of all children who are or will be in \nDCSโs custody, along with a subclass of children who, while \nin DCSโs custody, were not placed in the care of an adult \n1 The plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed their family integrity \nclaim.\n2 The record is admittedly vague on this point, but any vagary is \nimmaterial because it does not affect our disposition. On remand, the \ndistrict court remains free to certify, decertify, or amend classes, and the \nparties may resolve which plaintiffs remain adequate class members in \nthat forum. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 11 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 11\nrelative or person with a significant relationship with the \nchild, and a subclass of children eligible for Medicaid. The \nnamed  plaintiffs  supported  their  motion  for  class \ncertification with their complaint; raw data generated by \nDCS to show how DCS was failing to deliver timely health \ncare to foster children; expert reports by Steven Blatt, MD, \nMarci White, MSW, and Arlene Happach, a psychologist, \nwho declared that Arizonaโs foster care system put children\nin grave risk of harm by failing to provide adequate care; and \nindependent investigative reports, deposition testimony, and \nDCS/AHCCCS policy and educational materials. B.K. also \nsupported her claim as class representative with excerpts \nfrom her DCS file that, if interpreted and credited as the \nplaintiffs contended, could tend to show she has been kept in \ninappropriate home settings and has serious unmet mental \nand physical healthcare needs.\nB.K. asserted two due process claims on behalf of the \ngeneral class, one due process claim on behalf of the non-\nkinship subclass, and one Medicaid Act claim on behalf of \nthe Medicaid subclass. The district court analyzed the class \ncertification motion through the lens of these claims. In \nSeptember 2017, the district court certified the following \nclasses:\nGeneral Class: All  children  who  are  or \nwill be in the legal custody \nof DCS due to a report or \nsuspicion  of  abuse  or \nneglect.\nNon-Kinship\nSubclass: All  members  in  the \nGeneral Class who are not \nplaced in the care of an \nadult  relative  or  person \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 12 of 49\n12 B.K.V.SNYDER\nwho  has  a  significant \nrelationship  with  the \nchild.\nMedicaid\nSubclass: All  members  of  the \nGeneral  Class  who  are \nentitled  to  early  and \nperiodic  screening, \ndiagnostic, and treatment \nservices under the federal \nMedicaid statute.\nThe district court reasoned that the due process claims could \nbe litigated class-wide as to the General Class and Non-\nKinship Subclass by answering whether the alleged state-\nwide policies and practices were unconstitutional, following \nour reasoning in Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. \n2014). The district court explained that:\nEven if health issues may differ, every child \nin the [DCS] custody is necessarily subject to \nthe same medical, mental health, and dental \ncare policies and practices of the [DCS] in the \nsame way that the inmates in Parsons were \nsubjected to the policies and practices of the \nADC [Arizona Department of Corrections]. \nAny one child could easily fall ill, be injured, \nneed  treatment,  require  a  diagnostic,  need \nemergency  care,  crack  a  tooth,  or  require \nmental health treatment. And any child in the \nfoster care system would be subjected to the \n[DCS]  policies  regarding  placement \ndecisions.  Thus,  every  single  child  in  the \nfoster care system faces a substantial risk of \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 13 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 13\nserious harm if [DCS] policies and practices \nfail to adhere to constitutional requirements.\nThe district court followed similar reasoning to certify the \nMedicaid Subclass, explaining that:\nSimilar to the constitutional claims, central to \nthe claim here is the question of whether \npractices by [DCS] and AHCCCS failed to \nadhere  to  the  Medicaid  statute.  Even  if  a \nchildโs specific medical diagnosis may differ, \nhowever, whether the foster care systemโs \npractices  establish  a  pattern  of  non-\ncompliance arise from statewide policies and \npractices by [DCS] and AHCCCS.\nThe district court also held that class certification comported \nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1), (3)โ(4) and \n23(b)(2).\nThe Directors timely sought interlocutory review of the \ndistrict  courtโs  class  certification  order,  and  we  stayed \nproceedings in the district court pending our review. The \nonly  issue  on  appeal  is  whether  the  three  classes  were \nproperly certified, including whether the named plaintiffs \nand class members have standing to bring their claims.\nII.\nWe  review  a  district  courtโs  class \ncertification decision for abuse of discretion. \nAn error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.\nAccordingly,  we  first  review  a  class \ncertification  determination  for  legal  error \nunder a de novo standard, and if no legal error \noccurred,  we  will  proceed  to  review  the \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 14 of 49\n14 B.K.V.SNYDER\ndecision for abuse of discretion. A district \ncourt  applying  the  correct  legal  standard \nabuses its discretion only if it (1) relies on an \nimproper  factor,  (2)  omits  a  substantial \nfactor,  or  (3) commits  a  clear  error  of \njudgment  in  weighing  the  correct  mix  of \nfactors. Additionally, we review the district \ncourtโs  findings  of  fact  under  the  clearly \nerroneous standard, meaning we will reverse \nthem  only  if  they  are  (1)  illogical, \n(2)implausible,  or  (3)  without  support in \ninferences  that  may  be  drawn  from  the \nrecord.\nSali v. Corona Regโl Med. Ctr., 909 F.3d 996, 1002 (9th Cir. \n2018) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations \nomitted).\nโWe review the district courtโs factual findings [as to \nstanding] under the clearly erroneous standard and review \nthe district courtโs determination of standing de novo.โ Ellis \nv. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978 (9th Cir. \n2011).\nIII.\nClass actions are governed by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23. Rule 23(b)(2) provides that โ[a] class action \nmay be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . .. the \nparty opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final \ninjunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is\nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ Rule 23(a) in \nturn provides that โmembers of a class may sue or be sued as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only ifโ four \nclass  prerequisites  are  met.  These  four  prerequisites  are \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 15 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 15\ncommonly  known as  (1)  numerosity,  (2) commonality, \n(3)typicality, and (4)adequacy of representation. Gen. Tel. \nCo. of the Nw., Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).\nThe Directors argue that all three classes in this action \nshould not have been certified by the district court. We \nexamine each class in turn.\nA.\nThe district court certified a General Class consisting of \nโ[a]ll children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCS \ndue to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect.โ This class \nalleges that Director McKayhas violated the classโs right to \nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment \nby failing to care adequately for the children in the class. The \nDirectors argue that this class should have failed because the \nclass members lack standing to press their due process claim, \nthe class lacks commonality, the representative plaintiffsโ \nclaims and defenses are not typical of the class, and uniform \ninjunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) is unavailable.\n1.\nWe  begin  our  analysis  with  standing.  Standing  is  a \nโthreshold issueโ and an โessential and unchanging part of \nthe case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.โ Horne v. \nFlores, 557 U.S. 433, 445 (2009) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). โTo establish standing, \na  plaintiff  must present  an  injury  that  is  concrete, \nparticularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the \ndefendantโs  challenged  action;  and  redressable  by  a \nfavorable ruling.โ Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560โ61). The \nDirectors argue that absent class members lack standing \nbecause some class members are adequately receiving care, \nand thus do not have a concrete due process injury. However, \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 16 of 49\n16 B.K.V.SNYDER\nthe Directors misunderstand both the nature of the plaintiffsโ \ndue process claims and the nature of an Article III standing \ninquiry in the context of class certification.\nOf  course,  the  Directors  are  correct  that  class \nrepresentatives  must  have  Article  III  standing,  as  the \nirreducible constitutional minimum of a case or controversy. \nSee In re Zappos.com, Inc., 888 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. \n2018). It was the named plaintiffsโ burden โ as it would be \nany other plaintiffโs โto support each standing element โin \nthe same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears \nthe burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of litigation.โ \nLujan,  504  U.S.  at  561.  โ[T]he  manner  and  degree  of \nevidence required at the preliminary class certification stage \nis not the same as at the successive stages of the litigation โ\ni.e., at trial.โ Sali, 909 F.3d at 1006 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  But  the  Directors  then  confuse  the  standing \nanalysis in a class action for the class certification analysis. \nAs we have previously explained, โonce the named plaintiff \ndemonstrates her individual standing to bring a claim, the \nstanding inquiry is concluded, and the court proceeds to \nconsider  whether  the  Rule  23(a)  prerequisites  for  class \ncertification have been met.โ Melendres v. Arpaio, 784 F.3d \n1254,  1262  (9th  Cir.  2015)  (quoting  1  William  B. \nRubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions ยง2:6 (5th ed. 2011)). \nโ[A]ny issues regarding the relationship between the class \nrepresentative and the passive class members โ such as \ndissimilarity in injuries suffered โare relevant only to class \ncertification,  not  to  standing.โ  Id. (quoting  Newberg  on \nClass Actions ยง 2:6). This does not mean that Article III \nconsiderations are irrelevant to Rule 23, for we are always \nโmindful that the Ruleโs requirements must be interpreted in \nkeeping with Article III constraints.โ Ortiz v. Fibreboard \nCorp.,  527  U.S.  815,  831  (1999)  (alterations  omitted) \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 17 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 17\n(quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, \n612โ13 (1997)). But it does mean that when we measure a \nplaintiffโs standing, regardless of whether the plaintiff sues \nindividually or as class representative, we look concretely at\nthe facts that pertain to that plaintiff. Thus, the relevant \ninquiry here is whether B.K. has standing to bring the two \ndue process claims asserted on behalf of the General Class.\nIn this case, B.K. has standing to press her due process \nclaims, and that concludes the standing inquiry. B.K. has \nserious medical diagnoses that require prompt and adequate \nmedical  care  from  her  custodian,  which  is  the  State  of \nArizona.  She  has  presented  evidence  that  she  has  not \nreceived adequate medical care or appropriate placements in \nthe past as well as evidence that statewide policies and \npractices expose her to a risk of similar future harms. If state \nofficials  failed  and  continue  to  fail  to  provide  her \nโreasonable  safety  and  minimally  adequate  care  and \ntreatment  appropriate  to  [her]  age  and  circumstancesโ \nthrough the deficient statewide policies and practices she \nalleges, the harm to her will have been caused by those \nofficials. See Lipscomb v. Simmons, 962 F.2d 1374, 1379 \n(9th Cir. 1992). If those allegedly deficient policies and \npractices are abated by an injunction, that harm may be \nredressed by a favorable court decision. B.K. therefore has \nstanding to press the due process claims she brings on behalf \nof the General Class.\n2.\nWe next turn to whether B.K. may represent the General \nClass consistent with Rule 23. We begin our analysis with \ncommonality.\nRule 23(a)(2) provides that class members may sue as \nrepresentative parties only if โthere are questions of law or \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 18 of 49\n18 B.K.V.SNYDER\nfact  common  to  the  class.โ  โThat  language  is  easy  to \nmisread,  since  any  competently  crafted  class  complaint \nliterally raises common questions.โ Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011) (alteration and internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Richard Nagareda, Class \nCertification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 97, 131โ32 (2009)). Merely alleging a โviolation of the \nsame provision of lawโ does not satisfy commonality. Id. at \n350. Instead, the plaintiffsโ claims must โโdepend upon a \ncommon contentionโ such that โdetermination of their truth \nor falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity \nof each of the claims in one stroke.โโ Parsons, 754 F.3d \nat 675  (alteration  omitted)  (quoting  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S. \nat 350). โWhat matters to class certification is not the raising \nof common questions โ even in droves โ but, rather the \ncapacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.โ Id. \n(internal quotation marks, alterations, and emphasis omitted) \n(quoting  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  350).  โ[W]here  the \ncircumstances  of  each  particular  class  member  vary  but \nretain a common core of factual or legal issues with the rest \nof the class, commonality exists.โ Id. (quoting Evon v.

Due process requires the state to \nprovide children in its care โreasonable safety and minimally \nadequate  care  and  treatment  appropriate  to  the  age  and \ncircumstances of the child.โ Lipscomb, 962 F.2d at 1379. To \nprevail on a claim for failure to meet this duty, a plaintiff \nmust prove that state officials acted with such deliberate \nindifference to the plaintiffsโ liberty interest that their actions \nโshock the conscience.โ Tamas v. Depโt of Soc. & Health \nServs., 630 F.3d 833, 844 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Brittain \nv. Hansen, 451 F.3d 982, 991 (9th Cir. 2006)). This standard \nrequires proof of two facts: (1) an objectively substantial risk \nof harm, and (2) the officialโs subjective awareness of that \nrisk. Id. at 845. The second part may be proven by showing \n(1)  that  the  official  was  aware  of  facts  from  which  an \ninference of risk may be drawn and that the official made \nthat inference, (2) that the official was aware of facts from \nwhich an inference of  risk may be drawn and that any \nreasonable official would have been compelled to draw that \ninference, or (3)that the risk of harm is obvious. Id.\nBased on the nature of the plaintiffsโ due process claims \nand the scope of the class certified, the district court here did \nnot abuse its discretion by determining that commonality \nexists.  We  have  previously  recognized  in  the  Eighth \nAmendment context that a stateโs policies and practices can \nexpose all persons within its custody to a substantial risk of \nharm,  which  is  the  legal  standard  required  by  this  due \nprocess claim. In Parsons v. Ryan, we held that a class of \nโall prisoners who are now, or will in the future be, subjected \nto the medical, mental health, and dental care policies and \npractices of the ADC [Arizona Department of Corrections]โ \nhad sufficient commonality because โ[t]he putative class ...\nmembers thus all set forth numerous common contentions \nwhose truth or falsity can be determined in one stroke: \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 20 of 49\n20 B.K.V.SNYDER\nwhether the specified statewide policies and practices to \nwhich they are all subjected by ADC expose them to a \nsubstantial risk of harm.โ 754 F.3d at 678. We explicitly \nrejected the reasoning pressed on us by the Directors here: \nthat โplaintiffsโ claims a[re] ultimately little more than a \nconglomeration of many such individual claims, rather than \n... a claim that central policies expose all inmates to a risk \nof harm.โ Id. at 675 n.17. Thus, it did not matter whether \neach individual prisoner had already been harmed by falling \nsick  and  receiving  inadequate  care,  but  whether  every \nprisoner, solely by virtue of being in Arizonaโs prisons, was \nat substantial risk of future harm. Id. at 678. Because every \nprisoner in the class was exposed, โas a result of specified \nstatewide ADC policies and practices that govern the overall \nconditions of health care services and confinement, to a \nsubstantial  risk  of  serious  future  harm  to  which  the \ndefendants are allegedly deliberately indifferent ... every \ninmate suffer[ed] exactly the same constitutional injury.โ Id.\nThe โpolicies and practices [we]re the โglueโ that h[eld] \ntogether the putative class,โ because โeither each of the \npolicies and practices is unlawful as to every inmate or it is \nnot.โ Id.3\nThe  same  reasoning  applies  here.  The  district  court \nproperly  grounded  its  commonality  determination  in  the \nconstitutionality of statewide policies and practices, which is \na โcommon question of law or factโ that can be litigated in \n3 Some of the policies and practices alleged in Parsons included: \nโcreation of lengthy and dangerous delays in receiving care and outright \ndenials of health care; ...a practice of employing insufficient health care \nstaff; ...failure to provide prisoners with care for chronic diseases and \nprotection from infectious diseases; ... denial of medically necessary \nmental health treatment ...and ...denial of basic mental health care to \nsuicidal and self-harming prisoners.โ Parsons, 754 F.3d at 664 (internal \nquotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 21 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 21\nโone stroke.โ See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. Specifically, \nthe  district  court  identified  the  following  โstatewide \npractices affecting the proposed General Classโ: (1)failure \nto  provide  timely  access  to  health  care,  including \ncomprehensive  evaluations,  timely  annual  visits,  semi-\nannual  preventative  dental  health  care,  adequate  health \nassessments, and immunizations; (2) failure to coordinate \nphysical and dental care service delivery; (3) ineffective \ncoordination and monitoring of DCS physical and dental \nservices; (4) overuse of congregate care for children with \nunmet mental needs; (5) excessive caseworker caseloads; \n(6)failure to investigate reports of abuse timely; (7) failure \nto  document  โsafety  assessmentsโ;  (8)failure  to  close \ninvestigations  timely;  and  (9)  investigation  delays.\nRegardless  whether  any  of  these  policies  are  ultimately \nfound unconstitutional such that the plaintiffs prevail on the \nmerits, their constitutionally can properly be litigated in a \nclass setting. Thus, as in Parsons, the statewide policies and \npractices are the โglueโ that holds the class together. See \n754F.3d at 678.\nThe Directors do not seriously dispute the adequacy of \nthe General Class in this regard. At oral argument, counsel \nfor the Directors conceded that they were not challenging the \ndistrict courtโs application of Parsons, but the validity of \nParsons itself. That argument is beyond the scope of this \npanelโs authority and we will not address it. See Miller v. \nGammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899โ900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc) \n(holding that circuit precedent may be overturned only en \nbanc, with exceptions that do not apply here). We therefore \nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by \nconcluding that commonality existed.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 22 of 49\n22 B.K.V.SNYDER\n3.\nWe next address typicality. Rule 23(a)(3) provides that \nclass members may sue as representative parties only if โthe \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \nthe claims or defenses of the class.โ The named plaintiffโs \nrepresentative claims are โtypicalโ if they are โreasonably\ncoextensive with those of absent class members; they need \nnot be substantially identical.โ Parsons, 754 F.3d at 685 \n(quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th \nCir.  1998)).  โThe  test  of  typicality  is  โwhether  other \nmembers have the same orsimilar injury, whether the action \nis  based  on  conduct  which  is  not  unique  to  the  named \nplaintiffs,  and  whether  other  class  members  have  been \ninjured by the same course of conduct.โโ Id. (quoting Hanon \nv. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).\nIn Parsons, we concluded that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  similar  circumstances.  There,  we \nreasoned that (1)โthe named plaintiffs are all inmates in \nADC custodyโ and (2) โ[e]ach declares that he or she is \nbeing exposed, like all other members of the putative class, \nto a substantial risk of serious harm by the challenged ADC \npolicies  and  practices.โ  Id.  Based  on  those  facts,  we \nconcluded that\nThe named plaintiffs thus allege โthe same or \na similar injuryโ as the rest of the putative \nclass; they allege that this injury is a result of \na course of conduct that is not unique to any \nof  them;  and  they  allege  that  the  injury \nfollows from the course of conduct at the \ncenter of the class claims.\nId. (alteration omitted) (quoting Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508).\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 23 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 23\nOnce more, the same reasoning applies here. B.K. is a \nchild in Arizonaโs custody. The members of the General \nClass are children who are or will be in Arizonaโs custody. \nB.K. has demonstrated, not merely through allegations but \nthrough raw data, expert reports, deposition testimony, and \nDCS materials, that she is subject to statewide policies and \npractices that apply equally to every member of the class. By \ndefining her claim based on the risk of harm caused by these \npolicies  โ a  cognizable  constitutional  injury  under  our \nprecedent โB.K. has demonstrated that class members have \nsimilar injuries, based on conduct that is not unique to her, \nand caused by the same injurious course of conduct. See id.\nThe Directors counter that B.K., and in fact any class \nrepresentative,  remains  atypical  because  the  class  is \ninternally  in  conflict.  Citing  typicalityโs  purpose  of \nโassur[ing]  that  the  interest  of  the  named  representative \naligns with the interests of the class,โ Stearns v. Ticketmaster \nCorp., 655 F.3d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Wolin \nv. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., 617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. \n2010)), the Directors argue that class representatives will \nseek to prioritize their own desired reforms to Arizonaโs \nfoster care system at the expense of other possibilities. This \nis not necessarily true, cf. Peralta v. Dillard, 744 F.3d 1076, \n1083 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (โLack of resources is not a \ndefense to a claim for prospective relief because prison \nofficials may be compelled to expand the pool of existing \nresources in order to remedy continuing Eighth Amendment \nviolationsโ),  but  โ even  were  we  to  agree  with  the \nDirectorsโ argument in principal โ it would not be enough \nfor us to deem the district courtโs contrary decision a legal \nerror or โa clear error of judgment.โ See Sali, 909 F.3d at \n1002. B.K.โs claim is reasonably coextensive with absent \nclass membersโ claims, and that is sufficient.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 24 of 49\n24 B.K.V.SNYDER\nThe  district  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  by \ndetermining that the named plaintiffs were typical of the \nclass.\n4.\nFinally, we address uniform injunctive relief. Civil Rule \n23(b)(2) provides that โ[a] class action may be maintained if \n... the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act \non grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ โThe key to the \n(b)(2) class is the โindivisible nature of the injunctive or \ndeclaratory remedy warranted โthe notion that the conduct \nis such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as \nto all of the class members or as to none of them.โโ Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 360 (quoting Nagareda, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. \nat 132). โIn other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a \nsingle injunction or declaratory judgment would provide\nrelief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class \ncertification when each individual class member would be \nentitled to a different injunction.โ Id. (emphasis in original \nomitted).\nIn Parsons, we concluded that the district court did not \nabuse its discretion by certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class when \nthe  plaintiffs  requested  the  defendants  be  ordered  โto \ndevelop  and  implement,  as  soon  as  practical,  a  plan  to \neliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that prisoner \nPlaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class suffer due to \nDefendantsโ inadequate medical, mental health, and dental \ncare.โ 754 F.3d at 687. Rejecting the defendantsโ argument \nthat  every  individual  inmate  required  an  individual \ninjunction, we explained that Rule 23(b)(2)โs requirements \nare โunquestionably satisfied when members of a putative \nclass  seek  uniform  injunctive  or  declaratory  relief  from \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 25 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 25\npolicies or practices that are generally applicable to the class \nas a whole.โ Id. at 688. Thus, because โall members of the \nputative class and subclass [we]re allegedly exposed to a \nsubstantial  risk  of  serious  harm  by  a  specified  set  of \ncentralized  ADC  policies  and  practices  of  uniform  and \nstatewide application,โ the defendants had โacted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class.โ Id. \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).\nOnce  more,  the  same  reasoning  applies  here.  The \nplaintiffs have not brought a concatenation of individual \nclaims that must be redressed through individual injunctions; \nthey have brought unified claims that โa specified set of \ncentralized [DCS] policies and practices of uniform and \nstatewide applicationโ have placed them at a substantial risk \nof harm. See id. A single, indivisible injunction ordering \nstate officials to abate those policies and practices โwould \nprovide relief to each member of the class,โ thus satisfying \nRule 23(b)(2). See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.\nThe Directorsโ arguments to the contrary do not convince \nus. The Directors first argue that no injunction could apply \nto all plaintiffs in the general class because different foster \nchildren face different potential harms, thus having different \ncompeting interests, and thus needing different injunctive \nrelief. But this argument improperly assumes that abating the \nplaintiffsโ specified policies and practices will be an either-\nor  situation  where  only  some  (or  zero)  class  members \nreceive their desired relief. That is incorrect, for two reasons. \nFirst, class certification is not a decision on the merits, and \nthe plaintiffs will only be entitled to injunctive relief if such \nrelief is necessary to redress the constitutional violations \nthey actually prove at trial. Second, even if abating two or \nmore unconstitutional policies is impossible with limited \nfunds, state officials โmay be compelled to expand the pool \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 26 of 49\n26 B.K.V.SNYDER\nof  existing  resources  in  order  to  remedy  continuing \n[constitutional] violations.โ Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1083. For \ninstance, the district court could enjoin DCS to hire more \ncaseworkers in order to meet health care delivery deadlines \nin a manner that ensures the plaintiffs receive timely medical \nevaluations and care. Cf. Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 (โFor \nexample, every inmate in ADC custody is allegedly placed \nat risk of harm by ADCโs policy and practice of failing to \nemploy enough doctors โan injury that can be remedied on \na class-wide basis by an injunction that requires ADC to hire \nmore doctorsโ). Thus, any future lack of resources or other \nfederalism concerns invoked by the prospect of injunctive \nrelief go only to the ultimate scope of the injunction. They \ndo not per se forbid the district court from certifying a \nRule23(b)(2) class.\nThe Directors next argue that the district court erred \nbecause the plaintiffs failed to provide a specific injunction \nthat  could  satisfy  Rule  23(b)(2)  and  Rule  65(d).  This \nargument has no basis in existing law, whether in the text of \nthe Federal Rules or in our precedent. Plaintiffs do not need \nto specify the precise injunctive relief they will ultimately \nseek at the class certification stage. Instead, as we have \nexplained before, Rule 23(b)(2)\nordinarily will be satisfied when plaintiffs \nhave described the general contours of an \ninjunction that would provide relief to the \nwhole class, that is more specific than a bare \ninjunction to follow the law, and that can be \ngiven greater substance and specificity at an \nappropriate  stage  in  the  litigation  through \nfact-finding,  negotiations,  and  expert \ntestimony.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 27 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 27\nParsons, 754 F.3d at 689 n.35. In this case, the โgeneral \ncontours of an injunctionโ are enjoining DCS to abate the \nnine policies identified by the district court as amenable to \nclass-wide litigation. That was enough. A more specific \ninjunction  will  depend  on  further  fact-finding  and  what \nclaims the plaintiffs actually prove through further litigation.\nIn  sum,  the  district  court  did  not  err  or  abuse  its \ndiscretion in its rulings on standing, commonality, typicality, \nand uniform injunctive relief. We affirm the district courtโs \ncertification of the General Class.\nB.\nWe next consider the Non-Kinship Subclass. The district \ncourt certified a class of โ[a]ll members in the General Class \nwho are not placed in the care of an adult relative or person \nwho has a significant relationship with the child.โ As with \nthe General Class, the plaintiffsโ legal theory was that this \nsubclass was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth \nAmendment when  Director McKayโs statewide practices \nand policies placed them at substantial risk of harm.\nWe  begin  our  Non-Kinship  Subclass  inquiry  with \nstanding. Once more, the relevant question is whether B.K. \nhas  standing  to  challenge  the  allegedly  unconstitutional \npolicies and practices affecting the subclass. See Melendres,\n784 F.3d at 1262. Once more, we conclude that B.K. has \nstanding to bring this subclassโs due process claim. B.K. has \nalleged and presented evidence that she has been separated \nfrom her siblings, prevented from seeing her mother, placed \nin an inappropriate group home, and placed in temporary \nhousing for long periods of time. B.K. has also presented \nevidence, as we have previously discussed, that she has \nserious behavioral and medical concerns requiring attention \nfrom her custodian. B.K. has thus alleged and provided \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 28 of 49\n28 B.K.V.SNYDER\nevidence that, as a child in DCS custody, she faces a risk of \nharm from DCS policies and practices that inadequately \nprovide  for  children  who  do  not  have  available  kinship \nplacements.  Consistent  with  โthe  manner  and  degree  of \nevidence required at th[is] ... stage[] of litigationโ to prove \nstanding,  Lujan,  504  U.S.  at  561,  these  allegations  and \nevidence  describe  imminent,  concrete  injuries  โ fairly \ntraceable to the alleged state-wide practices and redressable \nby abatement of those practices. The district court did not err \nby concluding that B.K. has standing.\nThere is little else to add about this subclass that we have \nnot already said about the General Class. The Directorsโ \nbrief  does  not  suggest  a  reason  why  the  Non-Kinship \nSubclass would fail if the General Class succeeds, and we \nโwill  not  manufacture  arguments  for  an  appellant.โ \nGreenwood v. FAA, 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994). We \ntherefore confine our review to whether, under the same \nchallenges articulated in our foregoing discussion of the \nGeneral Class, the district court abused its discretion by \ncertifying the Non-Kinship Subclass.\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion.  The  district  court  identified  the  following \nstatewide  practices  affecting  the  Non-Kinship  Subclass: \n(1)excessive use of emergency shelters and group homes; \n(2)unnecessary separation of siblings; and (3) placement of \nchildren  far  from  home.  As  with  the  General  Class, \ncommonality, typicality, and uniformity of injunctive relief \nwere satisfied by identifying these practices because the \ndistrict court will be able to determine whether the Directors \nhave  an  unconstitutional  practice  of  placing  children  in \nsubstantial risk of harm by evaluating these practices as a \nwhole, rather than as to each individual class member. For \ninstance, if the plaintiffs prove that state officials have a \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 29 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 29\npractice  of  placing  children  in  emergency  shelters  for \nmonths, and that such a practice is unconstitutional, it might \ndeclare  that  practice  unconstitutional.  The  district  court \nmight then enjoin the Directors to take concrete steps to meet \nspecific  placement  deadlines,  such  as  by  expanding  the \nnumber of foster homes. Cf. Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 (โFor \nexample, every inmate in ADC custody is allegedly placed \nat risk of harm by ADCโs policy and practice of failing to \nemploy enough doctors โan injury that can be remedied on \na class-wide basis by an injunction that requires ADC to hire \nmore  doctorsโ). That  demonstrates  the  requisite \ncommonality, typicality, and uniformity of injunctive relief. \nIt does not matter whether, at this โtentative, preliminary, \nand limitedโ phase, see Sali, 909 F.3d at 1004 (internal \nquotation  marks  and  citations  omitted),  proving  the \nunconstitutionality of these practices will be difficult or not. \nIt  also  does  not  matter  whether  crafting  appropriate \ninjunctive  relief  will  be  difficult  or  not.  Those  merits \nquestions,  while  not  irrelevant  to  the  class  certification \ninquiry, do not preclude certification as a matter of law \nunless proving the answer to a common question or crafting \nuniform injunctive relief will be impossible. Otherwise, we \ncommit class certification decisions to the district courtโs \ndiscretion, and we hold there is no โclear error of judgmentโ \nhere that shows an abuse of that discretion. See id. at 1002.\nWe therefore affirm the district courtโs certification of \nthe Non-Kinship Subclass.\nC.\nWe last consider the Medicaid Subclass. The district \ncourt certified a class of โ[a]ll members of the General Class \nwho are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, \nand treatment services under the federal Medicaid statute.โ \nThe Directors argue that this subclass lacks commonality, \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 30 of 49\n30 B.K.V.SNYDER\ntypicality, uniformity of injunctive relief, and that the class \nlacks standing. The Directors also argue that the plaintiffs \nhave failed to prove sufficiently the factual bases for those \nrequirements.\n1.\nOnce again, we begin our analysis with standing. The \nrelevant  question  is  whether  B.K.  has  suffered,  or  will \nimminently  suffer,  a  concrete  injury,  caused  by  the \nDirectorsโ  failure  to  timely  provide  her  with  EPSDT \nservices, and redressable by a favorable court decision. See \nMelendres,  784  F.3d  at  1262.  These  elements  must  be \nsupported by โthe manner and degree of evidence required \nat th[is] successive stage[] of the litigation,โ Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 561, i.e., tentative class certification. At this โtentative, \npreliminary,  and  limitedโ  stage  we  have  held  strictly \nadmissible evidence is not required, see Sali, 909 F.3d at \n1004 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and \nwe have indicated that plaintiffs can meet their evidentiary \nburden in part through allegations when the allegations are \ndetailed and supported by additional materials, seeParsons,\n754 F.3d at 683 (concluding that plaintiffs met evidentiary \nburden  through  โfour  thorough  and  unrebutted  expert \nreports, the detailed allegations in the 74-page complaint, \nhundreds of internal ADC documents, and declarations by \nthe named plaintiffsโ).\nHere, B.K. alleges that she has been โdeprived of needed \nphysical and mental health care,โ including by failures to \nensure that she obtained glasses, to ensure she received \northopedic shoes, to have her seen by a dentist, to provide \nher with psychological evaluations, and to provide her with \ncounseling.  She  also  alleges  that  the  Directors  have  โa \npractice  of  failing  to  provide  members  of  the  Medicaid \nSubclass  with  the  screening,  diagnostic  and  treatment \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 31 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 31\nservices  required  under  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the \nMedicaid Act.โ These allegations, if true, would demonstrate \na concrete injury caused by the failure to receive EPSDT \nservices timely as well as โa sufficient likelihood that [s]he \nwill again be wronged in a similar way,โ which would be \nredressable by an injunction ordering the Directors to abate \nthe policies and/or practices that caused the delivery failure. \nSee Haro v. Sebelius, 747 F.3d 1099, 1108 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Armstrong \nv. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 861 (9th Cir. 2001) (abrogated on \nother  grounds  by  Johnson  v.  California,  543  U.S.  499 \n(2005)) (explaining that for purposes of standing to seek \ninjunctive relief, โthe plaintiff may demonstrate that the \nharm is part of a pattern of officially sanctioned behavior, \nviolative of the plaintiffsโ federal rights,โ and that โwhere \nthe defendants have repeatedly engaged in the injurious acts \nin the past, there is a sufficient possibility that they will \nengage in them in the near futureโ (alterations and quotation \nmarks omitted)). However, at this stage of the litigation \nallegations alone are insufficient to meet B.K.โs burden. We \ntherefore  examine  whether  she  has  submitted  sufficient \nevidence to support her standing to bring this claim.\nThe confidential medical and placement evidence in the \nrecord  is  thin,  but  we  conclude  that  it  is  sufficient  to \ncorroborate the allegations at this stage. B.K.โs allegations \nare supported by materials suggesting that she has in fact \nbeen denied the services she alleges she is entitled to but has \nnot received. B.K. has also submitted evidence suggesting \nthat these practices have continued over time and may occur \nagain. B.K. therefore has standing to bring her Medicaid \nclaim. To the extent the Directors are correct that these facts \nare wrong, that issue may be considered by the district court \non remand. On appeal, however, the materials in the record \nadequately support B.K.โs standing. We therefore proceed to \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 32 of 49\n32 B.K.V.SNYDER\nconsidering whether the Medicaid Subclass was properly \ncertified with B.K. as class representative.\n2.\nWe  begin  our  class  certification  analysis  with \ncommonality.  The  Medicaid  Subclass  poses  different \nquestions from the General Class and Non-Kinship Subclass \nin this regard. Unlike the due process claims, which were \nclearly alleged on a substantial risk of harm theory, the \nfoundation of the plaintiffsโ legal theory for the Medicaid \nclaim was somewhat opaque at class certification, and it \nremains opaque on appeal. In addition, while the ultimate\nsuccess of any Medicaid theory is irrelevant at this stage, \nmerits questions nonetheless matter at class certification to \nthe extent necessary to assess whether Rule 23 has been \nsatisfied.  See  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  351.  We  therefore \ncannot affirm the Medicaid Subclass certification without \nfirst carefully examining the nature of the plaintiffsโ claim \nunder the Medicaid Act.\nAs we explained in our recitation of the facts, Medicaid \nis โa cooperative federal-state program through which the \nfederal government provides financial assistance to states so \nthat  they  can  furnish  medical  care  to  low-income \nindividuals.โ Cal. Assโn of Rural Health Clinics, 738 F.3d at \n1010. States operate Medicaid plans that must conform with \nthe federal Medicaid statutes and regulations, and in certain \ninstances  beneficiaries  can  enforce  those  federal \nrequirements through a private action. Id. at 1010, 1013. One \nof these federal requirements is that state plans must provide \nmedical assistance to children within their care. 42 U.S.C. \nยง1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I).  This  medical  assistance  includes \nEPSDT services, id. ยง1396d(a)(4)(B), which are defined to \ninclude regular screenings, vision services, dental services, \nhearing services, and โ[s]uch other necessary health care, \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 33 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 33\ndiagnostic services,treatment, and other measures described \nin subsection (a) of [section 1396d] to correct or ameliorate \ndefects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions \ndiscovered by the screening services,โ id. ยง1396d(r). States \nmust ensure that EPSDT services provided are โreasonably \neffective,โ and, while they may delegate provision of such \nservices to other organizations, โthe ultimate responsibility \nto ensure treatment remains with the state.โ Katie A., ex rel. \nLudin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1159 (9th Cir. \n2007). States must also ensure that children receive EPSDT \nservices โpromptlyโ and โwithout any delay caused by the \nagencyโs  administrative  procedures.โ  42  C.F.R. \nยง435.930(a).\nIn  their  complaint,  the  plaintiffs  alleged  that  the \nDirectors violated the Medicaid Act by failing to provide \nEPSDT services timely. Although alleged as one claim, there \nare two possible legal theories that could support it. First, the \nplaintiffs  might  demonstrate  that  the  Directors  failed  to \nprovide statutorily mandated EPSDT services. See Katie A.,\n481 F.3d at 1159. Second, the plaintiffs might demonstrate \nthat, even if all required services were eventually provided, \nthe Directors failed to provide the services with reasonable \npromptness. See 42 C.F.R. ยง435.930(a); see also Kessler v. \nBlum,  591  F.  Supp.  1013,  1032โ33  (S.D.N.Y.  1984) \n(certifying  class  based  on  unreasonably  long  delays  in \nproviding services to all New York State residents). The \nplaintiffs here alleged both that the Directors had a practice \nof failing to provide EPSDT services and a practice of failing \nto provide EPSDT services with reasonable promptness, and \nthe district court reasoned that commonality existed because \nit could adjudicate whether Arizonaโs โfoster care systemโs \npractices establish a pattern of non-compliance.โ\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 34 of 49\n34 B.K.V.SNYDER\nWe hold that the district court abused its discretion by \ncertifying  the  Medicaid  Subclass  based  on  an  apparent \nmisconception of the legal framework for such a claim. \nThroughout this litigation, the plaintiffsโ class certification \nargument has rested on a misunderstanding of the Medicaid \nAct.  In  the  Eighth  Amendment  context,  and  in  the  due \nprocess context relevant to the General Class  and Non-\nKinship Subclass, proving a substantial risk of harm is all \nthat is necessary to prove the claim. See Parsons, 784 F.3d \nat 677 (โ[A] prison officialโs deliberate indifference to a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the \nEighth  Amendmentโ  (quotation  marks  and  citation \nomitted)). The same is not true of a claim under the Medicaid \nAct, which must be based on acts or omissions by the state \nthat  actually  violate  the  requirements  imposed  by  the \nMedicaid Act. Yet the plaintiffs have both here and in the \ndistrict court premised their arguments on the reasoning that \nproving risk alone establishes an EPSDT claim. Nothing in \nthe text of the Medicaid Act or its accompanying regulations \nsupports this approach because neither suggests that being at \nrisk of not receiving Medicaid services is itself a Medicaid \nviolation.  The  most  natural  reading  of  the  Act  and  our \nprecedents is that a violation occurs when EPSDT services \nhave failed to be provided in a timely manner. See Katie A.,\n481 F.3d at 1157 (โIn general, the EPSDT provisions require \nonly that the individual services listed in ยง1396d(a) be \nprovidedโ); 42 C.F.R. ยง435.930(a). The plaintiffs have thus \nconflated the commonality analysis for their due process \nclaims with the commonality analysis for their Medicaid \nclaims by erroneously importing the โsubstantial risk of \nharmโ  standard  from  Parsons without  considering  the \ndistinct nature of the Medicaid Act.\nThe district courtโs analysis on this point appears to have \nfollowed the same reasoning as was offered by the plaintiffs. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 35 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 35\nThe district court did discuss commonality in this case by \nreferring to common questions that were tethered to the \nMedicaid Act in particular. But the court identified those \ncommon  questions  as  โwhether  [DCS  and  AHCCCSโs] \npractices ...failed to provide timely and adequate access to \n... services; [] failed to coordinate care to ensure timely \nmedically necessary ...treatment ...;and [] failed to build \nand  maintain  an  adequate  capacity  and  infrastructure  of \nmental  health  providers  and  therapeutic  placements.โ \nWithout further findings on the policies or practices that \ncaused these failures, it is unclear whether the Medicaid \nclaim can be litigated class-wide, because it is not clear \nwhether  these  failures  caused  the  same  deprivations  of \nservices or  risks  of  such  deprivations  across  the  whole \nsubclass,  or  whether  some  categories  of  children  were \ndeprived services while others were not.4The district courtโs \nclass certification order thus rests on a legal error, which \nalways constitutes an abuse ofdiscretion. See Sali, 909 F.3d \nat 1002.\nThe plaintiffs nonetheless contend that class certification \nshould be upheld because a similar, but distinct, risk theory \nsupports the class. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that, \nbecause a plaintiff can have standing to challenge a statutory \nviolation before the violation has occurred, see Cent. Delta \nWater Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 949 (9th Cir. \n2002),  the  class  may  be  certified  based  on  a  common \n4 Relatedly,  it  is  not  clear  that  the  district  court  specifically \nconsidered whether B.K. is typical of those in the Medicaid Subclass, \nand thus whether Rule 23โs typicality requirement is satisfied with \nrespect to the Medicaid claim. The court concluded only that โevery \nchild in the foster care system under state custody is highly likely to \nrequire medical careโ without addressing whether every other child had, \nlike B.K., been denied adequate medical care or was subject to an \nimminent risk of a statutory violation.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 36 of 49\n36 B.K.V.SNYDER\nโsignificant riskโ of an imminent Medicaid violation to all \nclass members, see id. (identifying โsignificant riskโ as the \ncorrect  standard  when  a  plaintiff  challenges  a  future \nstatutory violation). Under this theory, the plaintiffs argue, it \ndoes not matter whether risk proves a completed Medicaid \nviolation because they can obtain injunctive relief based on \nrisk alone.\nAs a conceptual matter, we agree with the plaintiffs that \nRule 23โs commonality requirement can be satisfied in a \nstatutory case by a common risk of a future violation that \nflows  from  the  same  state-wide  policy  or  practice.  As \nexplained above, the relevant question for commonality is \nwhether every child in the Medicaid Subclass is subjected to \nthe  same  state-wide  policy  or  practice  that  violates  the \nMedicaid Act.5 There are two ways that this could occur. \nFirst, the policy or practice could be facially invalid, such as \nby directly contravening the Medicaid Act. This theory has \nnot been presented as the basis for commonality in this case. \nSecond, the policy or practice could expose every child in \nthe subclass to a significant risk of an imminent future \nMedicaid  violation.  Under  this  theory,  the  plaintiffs  are \ncorrect  that  they  may  challenge  the  Medicaid  violation \nbefore it has taken place, so long as the requisite โsignificant \nriskโ exists, so commonality may exist based on a finding \nthat all class members are subjected to the same risk. See id.\nThe  plaintiffsโ  argument  nonetheless  fails,  however, \nbecause the district court did not make factual findings or \n5 By this we do not hold, and our opinion should not be read to \nimply, that the plaintiffs must show that they will prevail on their claim \nof a Medicaid violation at the class certification stage. Rather, they must \nshow only that, if they do prevail on the merits, they will be able to \nprevail class-wide.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 37 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 37\nexercise  its  discretion  based  on  this  understanding  of \ncommonality  when  it  certified  the  Medicaid  Subclass.\nNowhere in its order is there a factual finding that every \nsubclass member was subject to an identical โsignificant \nriskโ  of  a  future  Medicaid  violation  that  would  support \ninjunctive relief. True, we could perhaps infer that such a \nfinding was made because the district court exercised its \ndiscretion to certify the class after correctly explaining that \nโcentral to the claim here is the question of whether practices \nby [DCS] and AHCCCS failed to adhere to the Medicaid \nstatute.โ But we are skeptical we should do so in light of the \nlegal error we have identified, which appears intertwined \nwith the district courtโs decision to certify this subclass. \nMoreover, as an appellate body we cannot presume that the \ndistrict court would have made this finding or exercised its \ndiscretion to certify the class had it considered this legal \ntheory  for  commonality,  and  we  will  not  supplant  its \ndiscretion by making that determination for ourselves. We \ntherefore  vacate  the  Medicaid  Subclass  and  remand  for \nfurther proceedings. 6 We emphasize that, while we have \n6 The partial dissent argues that vacatur is not warranted because \nโerrors of law that do not affect the district courtโsdiscretionary decision \ncan be disregarded.โ The partial dissent thus argues that we should \nuphold the Medicaid Subclass on the alternative risk theory presented by \nthe plaintiffs. But, as we have explained, doing so would substitute the \ndistrict courtโs role in certifying the class with our role in reviewing \ncertification on appeal. The record does not permit us to infer what the \ndistrict  court  must  have  found  as  to  the  Medicaid  Subclass  by \nextrapolation from the General Class.\nThe partial dissent suggests that we can make such an inference \nbecause โB.K. challenges the exact same state-wide policies that create \nthe exact same risk of not receiving the exact same medical services,โ \nand states that the โonly differenceโ between the class claims is that โto \nobtain an injunction under the Medicaid statute, B.K. does not have to \nprove deliberate indifference, as she must to obtain an injunction under \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 38 of 49\n38 B.K.V.SNYDER\nvacated  class  certification  based  on  the  nature  of  the \nlitigation to date, nothing in our opinion should prevent the \ndistrict  court  from  making  new  factual  findings  and \nexercising its discretion to recertify the Medicaid Subclass \non  remand,  if  it  determines  that  such  action  would  be \nappropriate.\nAll parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\nAFFIRMED  in  part,  VACATED  in  part,  and \nREMANDED.\nthe  Due  Process  Clause.โ  The  plaintiffsโ  counsel  did  make  that \nrepresentation about the class claims at oral argument. However, the \nrecord belies counselโs assertion. B.K.โs claim on behalf of the General \nClass challenged those harms cognizable under the due process clause \nfor medical deficiencies and the failure to conduct timely investigations \ninto reports of abuse or neglect, while B.K.โs claim on behalf of the \nMedicaid  Subclass  challenged  those  harms  cognizable  under  the \nMedicaid Act for EPSDT deficiencies. From these divergent claimed \nharms, the district court identified divergent common questions: the \ncommon questions binding the General Class were the constitutionality \nof the Directorsโ failure to provide physical and dental care, failure to \nprovide  mental  and  behavioral  health  care,  and  failure  to  conduct \ninvestigations timely, while the common questions bindingthe Medicaid \nSubclass were the legality of the Directorsโ failure to provide timely and \nadequate access to EPSDT services, failure to coordinate care to ensure \ntimely EPSDT services, and failure to build and maintain an adequate \ncapacity of mental health providers and therapeutic placements. The \nclass claims are thus not the same, and they cannot be treated the same \nfor purposes of class certification. Only a separate class certification \nanalysis, recognizing the difference between the due process claims and \nthe Medicaid claim as we have explained in this opinion, and making \nfactual findings in conformity with that legal framework, will ensure that \nโafter a rigorous analysis, ...the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been \nsatisfied.โ See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S.at 350โ51 (citation omitted).\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 39 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 39\nADELMAN,  District  Judge,  concurring  in  part  and \ndissenting in part:\nI concur in all parts of the majority opinion except for \nPart III.C.2, in which the majority concludes that the district \ncourt  abused  its  discretion  by  certifying  the  Medicaid \nsubclass. According to the majority, the district court abused \nits  discretion  because  it  made  an  error  of  law  when  it \nassumed that a state-wide policy or practice that exposes all \nmembers of the proposed subclass to a substantial risk of not \nreceiving Medicaid services violates the Medicaid statute. \nBut the answer to the legal question of whether exposure to \na risk of harm violates the Medicaid statute does not affect \nclass certification in this case, where the class seeks only \ninjunctive relief. So the district courtโs potential error of law \ndid not affect its application of the Rule 23 standards, and \ntherefore  any  such  error  did  not  result  in  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion. Moreover, the district court made findings of fact \nthat support its decision to certify the Medicaid subclass, and \nthose  findings  are  not  clearly  erroneous.  Accordingly,  I \nwould affirm the district courtโs certification of this subclass.\nI.\nThe majority affirms the district courtโs certification of a \nclass of Arizona foster children who seek to enjoin, under \nthe  Due  Process  Clause,  certain  state-wide  policies  that \nallegedly expose them to a substantial risk of not receiving \ncertain medical services. Oddly, the majority then vacates \nthe district courtโs certification of a subclass of the same \nchildren who seek to enjoin the exact same policies under \nthe Medicaid statute. Under the majorityโs approach, the \ndistrict  court  properly  certified,  under  the  Due  Process \nClause, a class of all foster children who challenge the stateโs \nallegedly  subjecting  them  to  a  substantial  risk  of  not \nreceiving  โtimely  access  to  health  care,  including \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 40 of 49\n40 B.K.V.SNYDER\ncomprehensive  evaluations,  timely  annual  visits,  semi-\nannual  preventative  dental  health  care,  adequate  health \nassessments, and immunizations.โ Maj. op. at 21. Yet the \nmajority concludes that the district court erred in certifying \na subclass of these children who seek to enjoin the same \nconduct under the Medicaid statute, even though Medicaid \nrequires the state to provide them with those very same \nmedical services. See 42 U.S.C. ยง1396d(r) (defining early \nand periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services to \ninclude  regular  health,  dental,  and  vision  screening  and \nappropriate immunizations).\nAccording to the majority, this contradictory result is \nrequired  because  the  district  court  misunderstood  the \ndifference between a claim under the Due Process Clause \nand a claim under the Medicaid statute. Under the Due \nProcess Clause, exposure to a substantial risk of harm is \nitself a violation of law, even if the harm does not ultimately \noccur. Maj. op. at 34. In contrast, under the Medicaid statute, \na violation is not complete until a child is denied required \nmedical  services  (or  fails  to  receive  the  services  at  the \nrequired time). Id.\nI agree with the majority that this is indeed a difference \nbetween a claim under the Due Process Clause and a claim \nunder the Medicaid statute. However, this difference has no \nrelevance to class certification in this case, in which the \nplaintiffs  seek  only  injunctive  relief.  As  the  majority \nacknowledges,  a  plaintiff  may  seek  injunctive  relief  to \nprevent a statutory violation before it occurs. Maj. op. at 36.\nAnd  that  is  exactly  what  the  plaintiffs  are  trying  to \naccomplish with the Medicaid subclass: they are trying to \nprevent Medicaid violations before they occur. The way they \nare trying to do this is by obtaining a single injunction that \nrequires the defendants to do things, such as hire more \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 41 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 41\ncaseworkers, that will ensure that all children receive the \nservices to which they are entitled underMedicaid. Thus, the \nclaims of the Medicaid subclass present common questions \nthat can be answered in one stroke. For example, either \nArizona  employs  enough  caseworkers  to  ensure  that  all \nchildren receive the EPSDT services required by Medicaid, \nor it doesnot; there is no need for a child-by-child inquiry to \ndetermine whether Arizonaโs staffing policies expose all \nchildren in Arizonaโs custody to a substantial risk of not \nreceiving those services. Cf. Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, \n680 (9th Cir. 2014) (โEither ADC employs enough nurses \nand doctors to provide adequate care to all of its inmates or \nit does not do so; there is no need for an inmate-by-inmate \ninquiry to determine whether all inmates in ADC custody are \nexposed  to  a  substantial  risk  of  serious  harm  by  ADC \nstaffing policies.โ). If the plaintiffs prove that Arizona does \nnot employ enough caseworkers, then a single injunction \nrequiring the state to hire more caseworkers will remove the \nsubstantial risk of Medicaid violations.\nThe situation would be different if the members of the \nMedicaid  subclass  sought  damages.  Because  exposing  a \nchild to a risk of not receiving required Medicaid services \ndoes not itself violate the childโs rights under Medicaid, the \nchild could not seek damages until services were delayed or \ndenied. But under the Due Process Clause, the child could \nseek at least nominal damages for a past exposure to a \nsubstantial  risk  of  harm.  Thus,  if  the  district  court  had \ncertified damages classes under both the Due Process Clause \nand the Medicaid statute, the majority would be right to \nvacate  certification  of  the  Medicaid  subclass.  To  award \ndamages under the Medicaid statute, the district court would \nhave to review the facts applicable to each individual class \nmember to determine whether he or she actually sustained a \nMedicaid violationโthere would be no common question \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 42 of 49\n42 B.K.V.SNYDER\nthat could be answered for all class members in one stroke. \nBut  again,  in  this  case,  where  the  plaintiffs  seek  only \ninjunctive relief, there are common questions that can be \nanswered in one stroke: whether the challenged policiesโ\nincluding failing to hire enough caseworkersโsubject all \nchildren in the foster care system to a substantial risk of not \nreceiving required services, such as timely immunizations. \nThus, the difference in what the plaintiffs must show to \nprove violations of the Due Process Clause and the Medicaid \nstatute  is  not  relevant  to  certification  of  the  proposed \ninjunction classes.\nThe majority concludes that vacatur of the Medicaid \nsubclass is required because Ninth Circuit cases hold that \nโan error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.โ Maj. op. \nat 13. The majority reads too much into this language. The \nmajority, in effect, reads this language to mean that if a \ndistrict judge misstates any legal principle in the course of \nstating its reasons  for  a discretionary decision, then the \nappellate court has no choice but to vacate the decision and \nremand for a do-over. But that cannot be what the language \nmeans. Instead, the language must mean that when a district \ncourt errs in its understanding of the legal standards that \ngovern its discretionary decision, the resulting discretionary \ndecision must be viewed as an abuse of discretion.But errors \nof law that do not affect the district courtโs discretionary \ndecision can be disregarded.\nFor example, if in this case the district court wrote that \nthe defendants could be liable under the Due Process Clause \nif the plaintiffs proved that they were negligent, the court \nwould have misstated the law, for, under the Due Process \nClause, the defendants could be liable only if the plaintiffs \nproved deliberate indifference. But this error of law would \nnot have affected the district courtโs discretionary decision \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 43 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 43\nto certify the class. That is so because the mental state for a \ndue-process  violation  is  not  an  element  that  affects \ncommonality or any other class-certification requirementโ\nthe defendantโs mental state is amenable to class-wide proof \nregardless of  whether  it  is  negligence  or  deliberate \nindifference. Thus, even if the district court identified the \nwrong mental state during class certification, it would not \nfollow that the court abused its discretion in certifying a class \nunder the Due Process Clause. Of course, the district court \nwould commit reversible error if it later granted relief to the \nclass based on a negligence theory, but in that case, we \nwould reverse the judgment granting relief to the classโwe \nwould not reverse the district courtโs order certifying the \nclass.\nThe district courtโs supposed legal error in this case is no \ndifferent than the district courtโs legal error in my example. \nBecause the Medicaid subclass does not seek damages, it \ndoes  not  matter  to  class  certification  that  a  Medicaid \nviolation does not occur until services are delayed or denied. \nThus, even if the district court thought that exposure to a risk \nof not receiving services violates the Medicaid statute, it \nwould  not  have  made  an  error  of  law  that  affected  its \napplication of the Rule 23 standards to the facts of this case.\nII.\nThe  majority  acknowledges  that  the  district  court \nidentified  common  questions  that  are  โtethered  to  the \nMedicaid Act in particular.โ Maj. op. at 35. But the majority \nthen faults the district court for failing to make โfurther \nfindingsโ that clarify โwhether [the challenged state-wide \npolicies  and  practices]  caused  the  same  deprivations  of \nservices  or  risks  of  such  deprivations  across  the  whole \nsubclass,  or  whether  some  categories  of  children  were \ndeprived of services while others were not.โ Id. at 35. This\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 44 of 49\n44 B.K.V.SNYDER\nis a curious statement. The majority seems to be saying that \nthe district court failed to find that the challenged policies \nexpose all children in the Medicaid subclass to a substantial \nrisk of not receiving timely access to health care. But that \nflatly contradicts the majorityโs reasons for affirming the \ndistrict courtโs certification of the General Class. There, the \nmajority found that the district court properly certified the \nGeneral  Class  because  the  question  of  whether  the \ndefendants  โfail[ed]  to  provide  timely access  to  health \ncareโโand thus exposed all foster children to a substantial \nrisk of not receiving that health careโcould be answered in \none stroke. Id. at 21. As I noted above, all members of the \nproposed Medicaid subclass are also members of the General \nClass, and the health care at issue in the claims of the General \nClass are services required by the Medicaid statute. Thus, if, \nas the majority concludes, the district court found that the \ndefendantsโ policies and practices expose all children in the \nGeneral Class to a substantial risk of not receiving those \nservices,  then  it  necessarily  also  found  that  those  same \npolicies and practices expose all children in the Medicaid \nsubclass to a substantial risk of not receiving those services. \nTherefore, the district court made the findings necessary to \nsupport its decision to certify the Medicaid subclass.\nThe majority also expresses concern over whether the \ndistrict court made the findings necessary to support its \nconclusion that B.K. is typical of those in the Medicaid \nsubclass. The majority states that the district court failed to \naddress โwhether every other child had, like B.K., been \ndenied adequate medical care or was subject to an imminent \nrisk of a statutory violation.โ Id.at 35n.4. But whether other \nchildren in the class had been denied adequate medical care \nis irrelevant, since the class is not seeking to remedy past \nviolations.  Moreover,  โimminent  risk  of  a  statutory\nviolationโ is a legal concept that governs standing, not class \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 45 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 45\ncertification.  See,  e.g., Lujan  v.  Defenders  of  Wildlife,\n504U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The majority agrees that because \nB.K. has standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of the \nMedicaid subclass, the standing inquiry ends there and there \nis no need to separately consider whether each class member \nhas standing. Maj. op. at 16, 30. Thus, the majority again \ncontradicts its own reasoning when it faults this district court \nfor failing to make findings showing that every child in the \nMedicaid  subclass  is  at  โimminent  riskโ  of  a  Medicaid \nviolation.\nI also struggle to discern how, in the majorityโs view, \nB.K.โs claim for injunctive relief could be โtypicalโ of the \nclaims of all foster children in Arizona for purposes of the \nDue Process Clause but not for purposes of the Medicaid \nstatute. Again, I emphasize that, under both the Due Process \nClause and the Medicaid statute, B.K. challenges the exact \nsame state-wide policies that create the exact same risk of \nnot receiving the exact same medical services. The only \ndifference is that, to obtain an injunction under the Medicaid \nstatute, B.K. does not have to prove deliberate indifference, \nas she must to obtain an injunction under the Due Process \nClause. It is thus logically impossible for B.K.โs claim to be \ntypical of those in the class for purposes of the Due Process \nClause but not for purposes of the Medicaid statute.\nIII.\nThe  majority  agrees  that  โRule  23โs  commonality \nrequirement can be satisfied in a statutory case by a common \nrisk of a future violation that flows from the same state-wide\npolicy or practice.โ Maj. op. at36. In this case, the members \nof the Medicaid subclass allege that they are subject to a \ncommon risk of not receiving required Medicaid services \nthat flows from the same state-wide policies and practices, \nincluding failing to hire enough caseworkers. Yet here the \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 46 of 49\n46 B.K.V.SNYDER\nmajority reasons that we must vacate the district courtโs \ncertification of the Medicaid subclass โbecause the district \ncourt did not make factual findings or exercise its discretion \nbased  on  this  understanding  of  commonality  when  it \ncertified the Medicaid subclass.โ Maj. op. at 36โ37.\nI am not sure what the majority means when it says that \nthe district court did not โexercise its discretion based on this \nunderstanding of commonality.โ The district court exercised \nits discretion to certify a subclass of all children who are \neligible for certain Medicaid services after finding that the \nsubclassโs claim presents a common question that can be \nanswered  for  all  subclass  members  in  one  stroke.  The \nmajority does not conclude that, in making this finding, the \ndistrict court erroneously applied Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes,  564  U.S.  338  (2011),  or  any  other  case  on \ncommonality.  Thus,  the  district  court  had  a  proper \nโunderstanding  of  commonalityโ  when  it  exercised  its \ndiscretionto certify this subclass.\nMoreover, the district court actually made the findings \nof fact necessary to support its finding of commonality for \nthe Medicaid subclass. The court found that the plaintiffs \nwere challenging โseveral statewide practices affecting the \nproposed  Medicaid  Subclass,โ  including  excessive \ncaseworker  caseloads  and  failure  to  properly  coordinate \nservices and monitor service providers. The court also found \nthat the validity of these practices could be determined in one \nstroke and without making individualized inquiries into any \nspecific childโs medical diagnosis or treatment. Thus, the \ndistrict court correctly determined that the subclass could be \ncertified for purposes of seeking injunctive relief against the \nchallenged policies.\nAlthough the majority correctly notes that the district \ncourt did not expressly state that every subclass member is \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 47 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 47\nsubject to an identical โsignificant riskโ of a future Medicaid \nviolation, this does not require that we vacate certification of \nthe subclass. Like โimminent risk,โ โsignificant riskโ is a \nlegal concept that governs standing, not class certification, \nsee Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d \n938, 949 (9th Cir. 2002), and the majority agrees that B.K. \nhas standing to seek injunctive relief against the challenged \nstate-wide policies under the Medicaid statute. The majority \nexpressly states that the district court correctly found that \nB.K.  has  standing  to  seek  injunctive  relief  against  the \ndefendantsโ policies because they expose herto a risk of not \nreceiving adequate medical care in the future. Maj op. 17.\nThus, the majority agrees that the district court made the \nfactual findings necessary to support standing.\nAs for class certification, there is no requirement that the \ndistrict court find that every subclass member is exposed to \nan identical significant risk of a future Medicaid violation. \nWhat the district court must find is that the plaintiffsโ claim\ninvolves an allegationthat all subclass members are exposed \nto a risk of a future Medicaid violation, and that the truth of \nthis allegation can be decided for all subclass members in a \nsingle stroke. See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678 (identifying the \nโcommon contentionsโ as โwhether the specified statewide \npolicies and practicesโ to which the class members are all \nsubjected  โexpose  them  to  a  substantial  risk  of  harmโ). \nObviously, the defendants dispute that their policies are \ndeficient and will try to show during the merits phase of the \ncase that they properly care for all children and therefore \nexpose none of them to a substantial risk of not receiving \nmedical care. The plaintiffs do not have to prove, at the class-\ncertification stage, that the defendantsโ policies are in fact \ndeficient. What the plaintiffs must do at class certification is \nshow that the question of whether the policies are deficient \ncan be resolved on a class-wide basis. And here, the district \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 48 of 49\n48 B.K.V.SNYDER\ncourt found that the plaintiffs did that. The court expressly \nfound that โ[e]ven if health issues may differ, every child in \nthe  [DCS]  custody  is  necessarily  subject  to  the  same \nmedical,  mental  health,  and  dental  care  policies  and \npractices.โ The court noted that โ[a]ny one child could easily \nfall ill, be injured, need treatment, require a diagnostic, need \nemergency care, crack a tooth, or require mental health \ntreatment.โ Thus, the district court found that โevery single \nchild in the foster care system faces a substantial risk of \nserious harmโ if DCS policies fail to ensure the delivery of \nappropriate medical care to children in the system.\nIt is true that the district court made the above findings \nin the context of certifying the General Class. But to repeat: \nevery child in the Medicaid subclass is also a member of the \nGeneral Class, and both classes challenge the exact same \npolicies involving the exact same medical services. Thus, if \nthe challenged policies subject every child in the General \nClass to a substantial risk of not receiving medical services, \nthey necessarily also subject every child in the Medicaid \nsubclass to a substantial risk of not receiving those services. \nTherefore,  the  district  courtโs  fact-finding  supports  its \ncertification of both the General Class and the Medicaid \nsubclass.\nIV.\nIn sum, the district court concluded that the claims of the \nMedicaid subclass involve common contentions that may be \nresolved in one stroke: whether the challenged state-wide \npolicies and practices subject all subclass members to a \nsubstantial risk of not receiving services required by the \nMedicaid statute. In reaching this conclusion, the district \ncourt did not err in applying the commonality standard, base \nits  conclusion  on  clearly  erroneous  findings  of  fact,  or \notherwise abuse its discretion. Accordingly, I respectfully \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 418   Filed 04/26/19   Page 49 of 49\nB.K.V.SNYDER 49\ndissent from the majorityโs vacatur of the district courtโs \ncertification of the Medicaid subclass.",

(Doc. 37 at 2). Defendants moved the Court abstain and dismiss the \n17 \nsecond amended complaint (the โcomplaintโ) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n18 \n12(b)(1) and the Younger and OโShea abstention doctrines. (Doc. 41). \n19 \nBACKGROUND  \n20 \n  According to the complaint, the number of children involved in foster care in \n21 \nArizona has substantially increased since 2003. Consequently, as of September 30, 2014, \n22 \n16,990 children were receiving out-of-home care through Arizonaโs foster care system. \n23 \nThe complaint alleges the increases were precipitated by budget cuts affecting programs \n24 \nwhich provide in-home services to children and support services for families.  \n25 \n  The  complaint  recounts  in  detail  the  experiences  of  the  ten  named  Plaintiffs, \n26 \nchildren ranging from three to fourteen years of age in foster care custody. There are \n27 \nseveral  common  threads  in  their  statements.  All  named  Plaintiffs  allegedly  failed  to \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 2 of 30\n \n \n \n1  receive necessary physical and/or mental healthcare, were separated from siblings who \n2  were also in the foster care system, and experienced frequent relocations and school \n3  transfers. Many allegedly suffered ill-prepared, neglectful, and abusive foster parents and \n4  inattentive caseworkers. As a result, Plaintiffs allegedly became suicidal, including a 9-\n5  year-old  child,  suffered  physical  and  mental  trauma,  and  experienced  significant \n6  educational disruption. \n7    Plaintiffs claim their experiences were caused by a number of โstructural and \n8  operational failures [which] continue to plague the stateโs child welfare system.โ (Doc. \n9  37). These failures include: 1) a shortage of and inaccessibility to physical, mental, and \n10  behavioral  health  services;  2)  widespread  failure  to  conduct  timely  investigations  of \n11  reports that children have been maltreated while in state foster care; 3) a shortage of \n12  family foster homes; and 4) widespread failure to engage in basic child welfare practices \n13  aimed  at  maintaining  family  relationships,  such  as  placing  siblings  together,  placing \n14  children with their biological parents on a trial reunification basis, coordinating visits \n15  between  children  in  state  foster  care  and  their  biological  families,  and  having \n16  caseworkers  make  regular  visits  with  the  biological  parents  of  children  to  monitor \n17  progress toward family reunification. \n18    Defendants are the directors of three state agencies: Defendant Gregory McKay is \n19  Director of the Department of Child Safety (โDCSโ), which is responsible for managing \n20  the stateโs child welfare system; Defendant Cara M. Christ is Director of the Department \n21  of Health Services (โDHSโ), which provides mental and behavioral health services to \n22  children in the state foster care system; and Defendant Thomas J. Betlach is Director of \n23  the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (โAHCCCSโ), which administers and \n24  supervises  the  stateโs  Medicaid  program.  Plaintiffs  maintain  these  individuals  are \n25  responsible for administering the foster care system and they have been aware of but have \n26  failed to address the problems outlined in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \n27  injunctive  relief  for  alleged  violations  of  substantive  due  process  rights  under  the \n28 \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 3 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Fourteenth Amendment;1 rights under the Medicaid Act;2 and the right to family integrity \n2  under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.3 The prayer for relief requests a \n3  permanent injunction barring Defendants from violating their rights, the establishment \n4  and implementation of policies and practices addressing each of the alleged violations, \n5  and appointment of a neutral expert to monitor progress and compliance. \n6    Defendants  move  to  dismiss  the  complaint  because  the  Court  allegedly  lacks \n7  subject  matter  jurisdiction  under  Rule  12(b)(1),  arguing  the  Younger  and  OโShea \n8  abstention  doctrines  apply.  Defendants  maintain  the  foster  childrenโs  ongoing \n9  dependency proceedings in the Arizona juvenile courts preclude the relief sought by \n10  Plaintiffs.  However,  Plaintiffs  argue  their  claims  rest  solely  on  actions  of  the  child \n11  welfare agencies and they are not challenging any aspect of any particular dependency \n12  proceeding. Preliminary background regarding Arizona juvenile courts and agencies is \n13  required. \n14  I. Role of Juvenile Courts \n15    In Arizona, โ[a]ny interested party may file a petition to commence proceedings in \n16  the juvenile court alleging that a child is dependent.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-841. Typically, such a \n17  petition is filed by DCS after an investigation into the childโs living conditions and \n18  removal  of  the  child  from  the  home.  See  A.R.S.  ยงยง  8-222;  8-223.  After  a  child  is \n19  removed, the juvenile court holds a preliminary protective hearing to decide whether the \n20  child should remain in DCSโs temporary custody pending a determination of dependency. \n21  A.R.S. ยง 8-824. The juvenile court then holds a dependency hearing to determine whether \n22  the child is in need of assistance or placement either because the child has no guardian \n23 \n                                              \n24  1 Including, but not limited to, the right to protection from harm and unreasonable \nrisk  of  harm  while  in  state  custody  as  a  result  of  lack  of  medical  care,  failure  to \n25 \ninvestigate mistreatment, and failure to provide adequate foster homes. (See Doc. 37 at \n29). \n26 \n2  Specifically,  the  early  and  periodic  screening,  diagnostic,  and  treatment \n27 \nprovisions. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a, et seq. \n28  3  Plaintiffs  define  the  right  to  family  integrity  as  including  Plaintiffsโ  liberty \ninterests, privacy interests, and associational rights under these amendments. \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 4 of 30\n \n \n \n1  responsible for care or the guardian is unable to provide the necessary care. See A.R.S. ยง \n2  8-844.  If  the  child  is  determined  dependent,  the  juvenile  court  โmay  enter  orders \n3  awarding a dependent child,โ subject to the supervision of DCS, to the care of the parents \n4  or to another member of the childโs family, or to an institution, association, agency (such \n5  as DCS), a school, an independent living program, or to a โreputable citizen of good \n6  moral character.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-845(A). In deciding where to place the child, the juvenile \n7  court must consider the goals of the placement and appropriateness of the case plan. \n8  A.R.S. ยง 8-845(B). The juvenile court is required to seek to reunite families, where \n9  possible, and order a permanency plan that maximizes the childโs contact with siblings, \n10  either through co-placement or frequent visitation, unless doing so would not be in the \n11  childโs best interest. A.R.S. ยง 8-845(C).4 โ[I]f the child has been removed from the home, \n12  the court shall order [DCS] to make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and \n13  the childโs parent.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-846(A).  \n14    After the dependency hearing, the juvenile court reviews the childโs case every six \n15  months. A.R.S. ยง 8-447(A). The periodic review hearings are an opportunity for the \n16  juvenile court to reassess the well-being of the child, monitor progress toward the childโs \n17  goals, and determine if the child continues to be dependent. A.R.S. ยง 8-847(D)-(E) (โAt \n18  [the] periodic review hearing, the [juvenile] court shall consider the health and safety of \n19  the child as a paramount concern. . . . [and] shall determine[] [w]hether [DCS] has \n20  identified  and  assessed  placement  of  the  child  with  a  relative  or  person  who  has  a \n21  significant relationship with the child. . . . [and] [w]hether the [childโs] guardian has \n22  complied with the court order . . . โ).  \n23    At each six-month review, the court also determines whether the childโs guardian \n24  has complied with court orders and whether the child is still dependent. A.R.S. ยง 8-\n25  447(D), (E).  And the court has the authority to โpunish a person for contempt of court \n26  for wilfully [sic] violating, neglecting or refusing to obey or perform any lawful order of \n                                              \n27 \n4 Although the juvenile court ultimately approves and issues the permanency plan \n28 \nin the form of a court order, it appears the plan is created and presented to the court by \nDCS.

Within twelve months of removal \n3  of a child older than three years, the juvenile court must hold a permanency hearing to \n4  determine the โmost appropriate planโ for the childโs permanent guardianship. A.R.S. ยง \n5  8-862.  \n6    The six-month reviews are based on progress reports prepared and submitted by \n7  DCS, which must include:  \n \n8 \n1.  An  assessment  of  the  extent  to  which  the  division  or  agency  is \n9  accomplishing the purpose of foster care for the child as described in the \ncase plan.  \n10 \n2. An assessment of the appropriateness of the case plan.  \n11  3. The length of time the child has been in foster care.  \n4. The number of foster home placements the child has experienced while \n12 \nin foster care and the length of each placement.  \n13 \nA.R.S. ยง 8-516(E). At each six-month review, the juvenile court also receives findings \n14 \nand recommendations from a local foster care review board; and the court must address \n15  these findings and recommendations on the record.5 A.R.S. ยง 8-515.03. \n16 \nII. Role of Child Welfare Agencies \n17 \n  DCSโs โprimary purpose . . . is to protect children.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-451(B).

Legal Standard for Rule 12(b)(1) Motion and Request to Abstain \n8    Plaintiffs  describe  Defendantsโ  motion  as  presenting  a  โfacialโ  rather  than \n9  โfactualโ challenge to the Courtโs jurisdiction. Courthouse News Serv. v. Planet, 750 F.3d \n10  776, 780 (9th Cir. 2014). Defendants do not contest this characterization. Assuming it is \n11  accurate, the Court must accept the allegations in the complaint โas true and draw[] all \n12  reasonable inferences in [Plaintiffsโ] favor.โ  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.d 1117, 1121 (9th \n13  Cir.  2014).  โOnce  challenged,  the  party  asserting  subject  matter  jurisdiction  has  the \n14  burden of proving its existence.โ Rattlesnake Coal. v. E.P.A., 509 F.3d 1095, 1102 n. 1 \n15  (9th Cir. 2007). Therefore, accepting Defendantsโ motion as framed by Plaintiffs, it is \n16  Plaintiffsโ burden to establish abstention is not required or should not be granted.  \n17    Though  not  raised  by  the  parties,  the  Court  notes  that  there  is  debate  about \n18  whether invoking abstention is a challenge to federal jurisdiction.6 Typically this matters \n19  because the party bearing the burden may differ depending on how the challenge is \n20  categorized. For example, unlike a challenge to jurisdiction, the Second Circuit has noted \n21 \n                                              \n22  6 The Ninth Circuit, like the Supreme Court, has alternatively described abstention \nas jurisdictional and not jurisdictional. Compare Canatella v. California, 404 F.3d 1106, \n23 \n1113 (9th Cir. 2005) (โYounger abstention is essentially a jurisdictional doctrine.โ) with \nBenavidez  v.  Eu,  34  F.3d  825,  829  (9th  Cir.  1994)  (โYounger  abstention  is  not \n24 \njurisdictional, but reflects a courtโs prudential decision not to exercise jurisdiction which \nit in fact possesses . . . .โ).  Compare Ohio Civil Rights Commโn v. Dayton Christian Sch., \n25 \nInc., 477 U.S. 619, 626 (1986) (explaining Younger abstention โdoes not arise from lack \nof  jurisdiction  in  the  District  Court,  but  from  strong  policies  counseling  against  the \n26 \nexercise of such jurisdiction where particular kinds of state proceedings have already \nbeen commencedโ) with Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Envโt, 523 U.S. 83, 100 n.3 \n27 \n(1998) (noting Supreme Court has treated Younger abstention as โjurisdictionalโ). See \nalso Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction ยง 13.2, at 828-829 (5th ed. 2007) (noting \n28 \nlack of clarity regarding whether Younger โannounce[d] a constitutional bar to federal \ncourt reliefโ or a prudential one). \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 8 of 30\n \n \n \n1  a defendant bears the burden of establishing one of the prerequisites for abstention.  \n2  Philip Morris, Inc. v. Blumenthal, 123 F.3d 103, 106 (2d Cir. 1997) (placing burden on \n3  the state to establish Younger abstention). In this case, however, determining precisely \n4  who  bears  the  burden  of  proof  is  unnecessary  because  the  result  is  the  same  even \n5  assuming the burden of proof rests solely with Plaintiffs.   \n6  II. Younger and OโShea Abstentions  \n7    The motion to dismiss invokes two closely related abstention doctrines: abstention \n8  under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and abstention under OโShea v. Littleton, \n9  414  U.S.  488  (1974).  These  two  doctrines  will  be  analyzed  separately,  but  the \n10  background for both begins with the recognition that federal courts have a โvirtually \n11  unflaggingโ obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given to them by Congress and the \n12  Constitution. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, \n13  817 (1976) (โAbstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the \n14  rule.โ). Only in unusual instances do principles of comity in relation to state courts \n15  warrant federal court abstention. See generally Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). \n16    A. Background of Younger and Its Progeny \n17    In Younger v. Harris, the Supreme Court held a federal court could not enjoin a \n18  pending state court criminal prosecution absent extraordinary circumstances, namely bad \n19  faith or harassment. 401 U.S. 37, 41, 54 (1971) (โ[N]ational policy forbid[s] federal \n20  courts  [from]  stay[ing]  or  enjoin[ing]  pending  state  court  proceedings  except  under \n21  special circumstances.โ) (emphasis added). The โunderlying reasonโ for the ruling was:  \n \n22 \n[T]he notion of โcomity,โ that is, a proper respect for state functions, a \n23  recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of \nseparate  state  governments,  and  a  continuance  of  the  belief  that  the \n24 \nNational Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are \n25  left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways. \n26   Id. at 44. \n27    Younger doctrine has both expanded and contracted over the years. In Huffman v. \n28  Pursue, Ltd., the Supreme Court extended Younger doctrine to a state civil enforcement \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 9 of 30\n \n \n \n1  proceeding. 420 U.S. 592 (1975). The decision was based, in part, on the Courtโs finding \n2  that  the  state  proceedings  were  โin  important  respects  []  more  akin  to  a  criminal \n3  prosecution than are most civil casesโ because the state was a party to the action and the \n4  nuisance statute involved was closely related to criminal statutes on obscenity.7 Id. at \n5  604-605 (โ[W]hile in this case the District Courtโs injunction has not directly disrupted \n6  Ohioโs criminal justice system, it has disrupted that Stateโs efforts to protect the very \n7  interests which underlie its criminal laws and to obtain compliance with precisely the \n8  standards which are embodied in its criminal laws.โ).8  \n9    The Supreme Court has also classified โthe temporary removal of a child in a \n10  child-abuse contextโ as a state proceeding โin aid of and closely related to criminal \n11  statutes.โ Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 423 (1979) (citing Huffman, 420 U.S. at 604) \n12  (emphasis  added).  In  Moore,  the  Court  characterized  Huffman  as  standing  for  the \n13  proposition that Younger applied to โcivil proceedings in which important state interests \n14  are involved.โ Id. at 423. The importance of a stateโs interest in a particular proceeding \n15  may be due to the stateโs presence as a party; the statute or executive action involved is \n16  โin aid of and closely related to [state] criminal statutesโ; โthe presence of such other \n17  vital  concerns  as  enforcement  of  contempt  proceedingsโ;  โor  the  vindication  of \n18  โimportant state policies such as safeguarding the fiscal integrity of [public assistance] \n19  programs.โโ Id. Even if one of these factors applies, however, the Supreme Court held \n20  abstention is only proper if the plaintiff will be able โto press his claim in the state \n21  courts.โ Id. at 432. \n22    In Juidice v. Vail, the Supreme Court once again clarified and expanded Younger, \n23 \n                                              \n24  7  The  civil  statute  in  question  provided  for  the  closure  of  any  place  which \nexhibited obscene films pursuant to nuisance law, while other state criminal statutes \n25 \nprohibited the dissemination of obscene materials.  Id. at 596, 604. \n26  8 The Supreme Court clarified that Younger abstention applies both to pre- and \npost-trial state court proceedings where a litigant has not yet exhausted state appellate \n27 \nremedies. Id. at 609 (โFederal post-trial intervention, in a fashion designed to annul the \nresults of a state trial, also deprives the States of a function which quite legitimately is \n28 \nleft to them, that of overseeing trial court dispositions of constitutional issues which arise \nin civil litigation over which they have jurisdiction.โ). \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 10 of 30\n \n \n \n1  holding the โprinciples . . . [were] not confined solely to the types of state actions which \n2  were sought to be enjoined in [Younger and Huffman], . . . [but that] the โmore vital \n3  considerationโ . . . [lay] in โthe notion of โcomity,โ . . . [and that] [t]hese principles apply \n4  to a case in which the Stateโs contempt process is involved.โ 430 U.S. 327, 334-335 \n5  (1977). The plaintiffs in Juidice had been held in contempt by state court judges for \n6  disobeying subpoenas to appear at proceedings brought by their creditors in an attempt to \n7  collect a judgment. The debtors brought a class action in federal court seeking to enjoin \n8  enforcement of the statutes granting state courts the power of contempt, arguing the \n9  statutes  violated  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Id.  at  329-330.  In  holding  Younger \n10  precluded the injunction, the Court reasoned: \n \n11 \nA Stateโs interest in the contempt process, through which it vindicates the \n12  regular operation of its judicial system, so long as that system itself affords \nthe opportunity to pursue federal claims within it, is surely an important \n13 \ninterest. Perhaps it is not quite as important as is the Stateโs interest in the \n14  enforcement of its criminal laws, Younger, [] or even its interest in the \nmaintenance  of  a  quasi-criminal  proceeding  such  as  was  involved  in \n15 \nHuffman[].  But  we  think  it  is  of  sufficiently  great  import  to  require \n16  application of the principles of those cases. The contempt power lies at the \ncore of the administration of a Stateโs judicial system. \n17 \n \n18  Id. at 335. \n  The Supreme Court later summarized Younger jurisprudence as applying to three \n19 \ntypes  of  cases:  1)  criminal  proceedings;  2)  quasi-criminal  proceedings;  and  3) \n20 \nโproceedings involving certain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courtsโ \n21 \nability to perform their judicial functions.โ New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of \n22 \nCity of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 368 (1989) (NOPSI).  \n23 \n  But in NOPSI, the Supreme Court emphasized a limitation of the Younger doctrine \n24 \nmaterial to this case: It does not โrequire[] abstention in deference to a state judicial \n25 \nproceeding  reviewing  legislative  or  executive  action.  [As]  [s]uch  a  broad  abstention \n26 \nrequirement  would  make  a  mockery  of  the  rule  that  only  exceptional  circumstances \n27 \njustify a federal courtโs refusal to decide a case in deference to the States.โ Id.   \n28 \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 11 of 30\n \n \n \n1    Not long after NOPSI, in Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar \n2  Association, the Court further identified three factors that together warrant abstention: 1) \n3  โan ongoing state judicial proceedingโ; 2) which โimplicate[s] important state interestsโ; \n4  and 3) in which โthere [is] an adequate opportunity . . . to raise constitutional challenges.โ \n5  457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982). For many years, lower courts treated these factors as the \n6  established  test  for  Younger  abstention.  However  very  recently,  in  Sprint \n7  Communications Inc. v. Jacobs, the Supreme Court made clear that the three factors \n8  enumerated in Middlesex are actually additional factors to be considered once a court \n9  establishes the ongoing state proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature. 134 S. Ct. 584, 593 \n10  (2013)  (โDivorced  from  their  quasi-criminal  context,  the  three Middlesex conditions \n11  would  extend Younger to  virtually  all  parallel  state  and  federal  proceedings,  at  least \n12  where a party could identify a plausibly important state interest.โ).  \n13    Thus, Sprint arguably narrowed the application of Younger abstention. In doing so, \n14  the Supreme Court emphasized Younger is โexceptional,โ that federal courts have an \n15  overarching duty to โentertain and resolve on the merits [actions] within the scope of a \n16  jurisdictional grant,โ and the โgeneral ruleโ that โ[t]he pendency of an action in [a] state \n17  court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having \n18  jurisdiction.โ 134 S. Ct. 584, 588 (2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n19  Once  again,  the  Supreme  Court  established  โYounger  extends  [only]  to  []  three \n20  โexceptional circumstancesโโ: 1) ongoing state criminal prosecutions; 2) ongoing state \n21  civil enforcement proceedings; and 3) ongoing state civil proceedings involving certain \n22  orders uniquely in furtherance of state courtsโ ability to perform judicial functions. Id. at \n23  594. \n24    Following Sprint, the Ninth Circuit held Younger abstention is appropriate in civil \n25  cases  โonly  when  the  state  proceedings:  (1)  are  ongoing,  (2)  are  quasi-criminal \n26  enforcement actions or involve a stateโs interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of \n27  its courts, (3) implicate an important state interest, and (4) allow litigants to raise federal \n28  challenges.โ ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 754 F.3d 754, 759 \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 12 of 30\n \n \n \n1  (9th Cir. 2014). Once these threshold requirements are met, the Ninth Circuit considers a \n2  fifth  issue  involving  abstention;  that  is,  whether  โ[t]he  requested  relief  []  seek[s]  to \n3  enjoinโor ha[s] the practical effect of enjoiningโongoing state proceedings.โ Id. at 758.  \n4  Accordingly, while the test for invoking Younger abstention has varied over time, it is \n5  now clearly established that analysis of each factor in relation to the facts alleged in the \n6  complaint is required. \n7    B. Whether Younger Applies to the Present Case \n8    Defendants contend Younger requires abstention in this case pursuant to the two \n9  categories of civil cases to which the doctrine applies. They argue the injunctive relief \n10  Plaintiffs seek would interfere with the state juvenile courtโs ability to perform its judicial \n11  functions and that the case is related to ongoing proceedings in the state juvenile court \n12  which are quasi-criminal in nature. Plaintiffs maintain Younger abstention is not required \n13  because  the  relief  sought  is  โsystemicโ  in  nature  and  targets  state  agencies,  not  the \n14  juvenile court.  \n15      i. There are ongoing state court proceedings. \n16    In order for Younger to apply, Plaintiffs must be involved in an ongoing state court \n17  proceeding.  Defendants  argue  each  named  Plaintiff  and  putative  class  member  is \n18  presently involved in an ongoing, individual juvenile court proceeding. Plaintiffs do not \n19  appear to dispute they are subject to the ongoing oversight of the juvenile courts. This \n20  Court then will assume the juvenile courts ongoing jurisdiction over dependent children \n21  and case-by-case periodic review hearings satisfy the first prong of Younger. See A.R.S. \n22  ยงยง 8-202(G); 8-447.  \n23      ii. The ongoing state court proceedings are not quasi-criminal nor do \n         they involve Arizonaโs interest in enforcing orders of its courts. \n24 \n  The next step is to determine whether the proceedings are either quasi-criminal or \n25 \ninvolve  the  stateโs  interest  in  enforcing  the  orders  of  its  courts.  If  the  state  court \n26 \nproceedings do not fall into either one of these two categories, Younger abstention is not \n27 \nappropriate.  Defendants  argue  the  juvenile  court  proceedings  satisfy  both  categories \n28 \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 13 of 30\n \n \n \n1  while Plaintiffs argue they satisfy neither. \n2        a. Quasi-Criminal \n3    Defendants argue the proceedings are quasi-criminal because the juvenile court \n4  has โsubstantial and continuous exclusive authority in all aspects of child dependency \n5  cases,โ including those involving child abuse. (Doc 49 at 5). Plaintiffs argue the ongoing \n6  state  court  proceedings  are  not  quasi-criminal  because  their  purpose  is  to  review \n7  executive action and not enforce criminal laws. \n8    Defendants primarily rely on Moore v. Sims, in which the Supreme Court held \n9  proceedings ordering the temporary removal of children in the context of alleged child-\n10  abuse were quasi-criminal. 442 U.S. 415, 423 (1979). The Moore Court did not clarify \n11  the reasoning behind this decision other than to state: โthe State [] was a party . . . [and] \n12  the temporary removal of a child in the child-abuse context is, like the public nuisance \n13  statute involved in Huffman, โin aid of and closely related to criminal statutes.โโ Id.  \n14    But in a class action on behalf of Massachusettsโ foster children, Connor B. ex rel. \n15  Vigurs v. Patrick, a district court distinguished Moore, holding: \n16  Defendantsโ argument fails to appreciate that Plaintiffsโ claims relate only \nto  alleged  injuries  suffered  while  in  [Massachusettsโ  Department  of \n17 \nChildren and Families (โDCFโ)] custody. [P]roceedings [whereby juvenile \n18  courts  place  children  in  state  custody  due  to  abuse  or  neglect  by  their \nparents]  are  the  means  by  which  Plaintiffs  enter  DCF  custody,  and \n19 \nPlaintiffs expressly state that they are not challenging any aspect of those \n20  proceedings in this case. \n \n21 \n771 F. Supp. 2d 142, 154 (D. Mass. 2011).  \n22 \n  Like  the  Massachusetts  case,  this  case  does  not  concern  temporary  removal \n23 \nproceedings but rather involves, to some extent, periodic review hearings which take \n24  place once a child is determined dependent and placed in state custody. In Arizona, \n25  proceedings to remove a child from the familial home and periodic reviews while in state \n26  custody are distinct. They are governed by different provisions of state law.9 And the \n27 \n                                              \n28  9  Removal  proceedings  are  governed  by  Chapter  9  and  periodic  reviews  by \nChapter 10 of Title 8, Article 4 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 14 of 30\n \n \n \n1  procedures for affecting the temporary removal of a child in Arizona do not involve a \n2  finding of dependency.10 See A.R.S. ยง 8-821. While the six-month status reviews only \n3  take place if a child has been determined dependent by the juvenile court. See A.R.S. ยง 8-\n4  841 et seq. \n5    Although many of the children in the putative class may have entered the foster \n6  care system amid circumstances of abuse and neglect prohibited by the criminal law, as \n7  in the Massachusetts case, the complaint addresses the experiences children have after \n8  they are determined dependent and placed in state custody, not the proceedings which led \n9  to that custody. In Moore, by contrast, the state court proceeding was an emergency \n10  removal of children due to allegations of abuse. The proceedings had been and were \nongoing because the children had only been removed on a temporary basis, pending \n11 \nfurther findings. The state court proceedings in Moore were not those described here.  \n12 \n  The animating purpose of the ongoing dependency proceedings in this case is to \n13 \nplan for and monitor the development and well-being of children, not to investigate or \n14 \npenalize those who might have contributed to their dependency. A.R.S. ยง 8-847(D) (โAt \n15 \nany periodic review hearing, the court shall consider the health and safety of the child as \n16 \na paramount concernโ). The type of proceedings here employs a conciliatory approach. In \n17 \naddition to representatives from state child welfare agencies, parents,11 relatives, foster \n18 \nparents, shelter care facility personnel, and others are invited to participate in the review \n19 \nproceedings  and  share  their  views  on  the  childโs  best  interest.  A.R.S.  ยง  8-847(B). \n20 \n                                              \n21 \n10 In Arizona, the temporary removal of a child may be affected in one of two \n22 \nways. First, an interested person may petition the juvenile court for an order by stating, \nunder  oath,  โreasonable  grounds  exist  to  believe  that  temporary  custody  is  clearly \n23 \nnecessary  to  protect  the  child  from  suffering  abuse  or  neglect.โ  A.R.S.  ยง  8-821(A). \nSecond, a peace officer, a child welfare investigator, or a child safety worker may take a \n24 \nchild into temporary custody without an order from the juvenile court โif temporary \ncustody is clearly necessary to protect the child because probable cause exists to believe \n25 \nthat the child is: 1. A victim or will imminently become a victim of abuse or neglect[; or] \n2. Suffering serious physical or emotional injury that can only be diagnosed by a medical \n26 \ndoctor or psychologist[; or] 3. Physically injured as a result of living on premises where \ndangerous drugs or narcotic drugs are being manufactured[;] . . . [or] 4. Reported by the \n27 \ndepartment to be a missing child at risk of serious harm.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-821(B). Children \nmay not remain in temporary custody for more than 72 hours. A.R.S. ยง 8-821(F). \n28 \n11 As long as they have not relinquished or had their parental rights terminated. \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 15 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Although the state is a party in the proceedings and is responsible for investigating \n2  childrenโs circumstances and is required to produce a report for the court, the stateโs \n3  investigations  and  reports  are  not  prepared  for  the  primary  or  secondary  purpose  of \n4  enforcing criminal laws. See A.R.S. ยง 8-516(E). In sum, periodic reviews differ from \n5  emergency  removals  like  the  one  at  issue  in  Moore,  where  an  immediate  threat  of \n6  criminal harm warranted the removal of children from the custody of the parents without \n7  a hearing. Rather, the juvenile court reviews here have an indirect relationship to the \n8  enforcement of criminal laws. They do not qualify as quasi-criminal for purposes of \n9  Younger. \n10        b. State Interest in Enforcing State Court Orders and \n          Judgments  \n11 \n12    Even if the state court proceedings satisfactorily establish they are not quasi-\n13  criminal in nature, Younger abstention may apply if the proceedings involve the stateโs \n14  interest  in  enforcing  the  orders  and  judgments  of  its  courts.  Defendants  argue  the \n15  equitable relief Plaintiffs seek would interfere with the juvenile courtsโ determinations of \n16  foster childrenโs placements, visitation, and health care services, as well as its power to \n17  enforce its own orders through contempt proceedings. Defendants cite references in the \n18  complaint to instances in which state agencies have allegedly failed to comply with \n19  juvenile court orders and Defendants maintain: โ[T]he remedy for non-compliance with a \n20  state court judgment is contempt of state court, not a statewide class action in federal \n21  court.โ (Doc. 41 at 21) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs argue this suit does not implicate \n22  orders uniquely in furtherance of the state courtโs ability to perform its judicial functions \n23  because reversal or challenge of court orders is not sought here.  \n24    In order to determine whether this action implicates or would interfere with the \n25  ability of state courts to perform judicial functions, the Court looks to the specific relief \n26  sought in the complaint. See generally Gilbertson v. Albright, 381 F.3d 965 (9th Cir. \n27  2004) (discussing development of Younger from suits involving equitable relief to those \n28  involving declaratory and monetary relief). Plaintiffs seek an order directing Defendants \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 16 of 30\n \n \n \n1  to establish and implement broad and comprehensive practices to ensure:  \n2  1.  โ[Foster children] receive the physical, mental and behavioral health services to \n3  which they are entitledโ pursuant to substantive due process and the Medicaid Act;  \n4  2.  โ[A] minimally adequate capacity and array of [foster care] placementsโ;  \n5  3.  โ[M]inimally adequate visitation between [family] membersโ; \n6  4.  โ[M]inimally adequate investigation into reports . . .

Plaintiffs also seek the appointment of a neutral monitor and the \n10  Courtโs continued oversight over compliance with its order of enforcement. \n11    Plaintiffs  argue  the  complaint  targets  only  executive  functions  of  Defendantsโ \n12  agencies, not the judicial functions of the juvenile courts. Therefore, abstention is not \n13  required  relying  on  NOPSI.  In  NOPSI,  the  Supreme  Court  held  Younger  does  not \n14  โrequire[] abstention in deference to a state judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or \n15  executive action.โ  New  Orleans  Pub.  Serv.,  Inc.  v.  Council  of  City  of  New  Orleans \n16  (NOPSI),  491  U.S.  350,  368  (1989).  Several  district  courts  addressing  the  issue  of \n17  whether a federal foster care class action interferes with ongoing state court dependency \n18  proceedings have similarly relied on NOPSI. See, e.g., M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d \n19  712, 718 (S.D. Tex. 2011). Those courts have generally held complaints seeking relief \n20  from systemic problems in state foster care agencies โaid the ongoing state proceedings \n21  [in juvenile court], [and do] not interfere with them.โ Id. at 720. See also Kenny A. ex rel. \n22  Winn v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 286 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (โAlthough plaintiffs all have \n23  periodic reviews before the state juvenile courts, the declaratory and injunctive relief \n24  plaintiffs seek is not directed at their review hearings, or at Georgiaโs juvenile courts, \n25  juvenile court judges, or juvenile court personnel. Rather, plaintiffs seek relief directed \n26  solely  at  executive  branch  defendants  to  remedy  their  alleged  failures  as  plaintiffsโ \n27  custodians.โ) (emphasis in original); Dwayne B. v. Granholm, No. 06-13548, 2007 WL \n28  1140920, at *6 (E.D. Mich.

The relief sought here is not directed at the juvenile courts. It is directed at \n5  the executive branch.โ).12 \n6    In  fact,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  specifically  recognized  the  absence  of  inherent \n7  interference  from  a  federal  class  action  brought  against  the  director  of  Arizonaโs \n8  executive agency in charge of foster care and proceedings before the Arizona juvenile \n9  court.  In  L.  H.  v.  Jamieson,  a  class  of  juveniles  โadjudged  dependent,  neglected  or \n10  delinquent by Arizona state courts . . . [and] placed in private, child-caring facilitiesโ \n11  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  seeking  additional  funding  for  the  private \n12  agencies caring for them while in state custody. 643 F.2d 1351 (9th Cir. 1981). Reversing \n13  the district courtโs decision to abstain under Younger, the court held โan order that would \n14  require Arizona to spend more money to fund dispositional alternatives for juveniles in \n15  state custodyโ may โaffect pending and ongoing state juvenile proceedingsโ to the extent \n16  of โenrich[ing the variety of dispositional alternatives available to a juvenile court judgeโ \n17  but it would not โhave the wholly disruptive consequences associated with enjoining a \n18  state judicial proceeding.โ Id. at 1354.13 \n19    Defendants also claim the prayer for relief is โartful pleading.โ They insist the \n20  allegations in the complaint tell a different story about the aims of the requested relief \n21 \n                                              \n22  12 Although these cases were decided before Sprint, in applying the Middlesex \nfactors, the courts essentially addressed the question the Supreme Court articulated in \n23 \nSprint: whether the federal suit would interfere โwith pending civil proceedings involving \ncertain orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courtsโ ability to perform their \n24 \njudicial functions.โ Id. at 586 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These \nrulings are relevant and consistent with Sprint because their analysis of interference \n25 \ninvolves  many  of  the  same  factors  considered  in  determining  whether  state  court \nproceedings involve the stateโs interest in and ability to enforce the orders of courts. \n26 \n13 The Court is cognizant the question under this prong of Younger is not whether \n27 \nthe  federal  case  would  โhave  the  wholly  disruptive  consequences  associated  with \nenjoining [the] state judicial proceedingโ but whether the federal suit would interfere with \n28 \nthe functioning of the state court. \n \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 18 of 30\n \n \n \n1  and ask the Court to use those allegations as the basis for an examination under Younger. \n2  Defendants argue Plaintiffs claims of harm coupled with allegations of frequent transfers \n3  between foster homes, placements far from family members, lack of visitation between \n4  children and family members, and more demonstrate the ultimate goal of interfering with \n5  the juvenile courtsโ power over placements, visitation, and health services through a \n6  federal  court  order.  But  this  argument  ignores  the  standard  articulated  in  31  Foster \n7  Children v. Bush, a case Defendants otherwise cite as authority. 329 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. \n8  2003). Again, there the court held a court must โlook to the relief requested and the effect \n9  it would have on the state proceedings,โ not the allegations in the complaint, to determine \n10  whether the federal action would interfere with the state courtโs proceedings. Id. at 1276 \n11  (citing OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 499โ502 (1974)) (plaintiffs in Foster Children \n12  sought a district court-appointed panel with โauthority to implement a systemwide plan to \n13  revamp and reform dependency proceedings in Florida, as well as the appointment of a \n14  permanent  childrenโs  advocate  to  oversee  that  plan.โ).  Furthermore,  although  the \n15  complaint  includes  anecdotal  evidence  from  individual  childrenโs  cases,  these  are \n16  examples of the alleged broader phenomena the complaint describes and for which its \n17  relief is requested.  \n18    Defendants also argue the juvenile court system of today bears no resemblance to \n19  the system in 1981, the year Jamieson was decided. It is alleged the legislature has since \n20  greatly expanded the juvenile courtsโ role in deciding childrenโs placement, visitation, \n21  and health services. But even under todayโs statutes, although the juvenile courts can and \n22  do order DCS, its subdivisions, and related agencies to provide children with placements, \n23  visitation, and healthcare services, they do not have jurisdiction to monitor, or, more \n24  important, control how the agencies are organized to provide these services. In other \n25  words, the juvenile courts rule on individual cases, not how to remedy deficiencies in the \n26  overall administration of foster care. As such, the requested relief would not interfere \n27  with the functioning of the juvenile courts. See M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d 712, 719 \n28  (S.D.  Tex.  2011)  (โPlaintiffs  seek  broad  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  aimed  at \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 19 of 30\n \n \n \n1  improving the Texas foster care system as a whole, not to interrupt, alter, or in any other \n2  manner change a particular state court placement review decision.โ).  \n3    The Court will examine each aspect of Plaintiffsโ requested relief to ensure it \n4  concerns systemic problems not individual cases.14 \n5    Placement: Defendants claim โArizona law mandates that juvenile courts make all \n6  placement decisions for dependent children.โ (Doc. 41 at 8, 16). However, though the \n7  juvenile  court  โmayโ  order  the  placement  of  a  child  following  a  determination  of \n8  dependency, Arizona law permits DCS under some circumstances to place children in \n9  foster  homes  subject  only  to  ratification  by  the  juvenile  court.  See  A.R.S.  ยง  8-514 \n10  (โ[DCS] or a licensed child welfare agency if so authorized in its license may place a \n11  child in a licensed foster home for care or for adoption.โ); Antonio P. v. Arizona Depโt of \n12  Econ. Sec., 218 Ariz. 402, 404 (Ct. App. 2008) (discussing the authority of the juvenile \n13  court to ratify or alter a foster placement). DCS does not need prior court approval to \n14  change a placement unless the change is challenged by a third party. See A.R.S. ยง 8-\n15  515.05 (statute governing challenges by foster parents to removal of foster children from \n16  their care). DCS also determines the eligibility and licensing procedures for foster homes \n17  and is responsible for supervising those homes. A.R.S. ยงยง 8-503(4)(b)-(h); 8-509; 8-516. \n18  DCS may deny an application, suspend, or revoke a foster parentโs license for violations \n19  of state statutes governing child welfare. A.R.S. ยง 8-506.  \n20    The request by Plaintiffs for โpractices to ensure a minimally adequate capacity \n21  and array of placementsโ by DCS does not interfere with the juvenile courtsโ authority or \n                                              \n22 \n14 Defendantsโ reliance on Peterson v. Babbitt, decided two years after Jamieson, \n23 \nis misplaced. 708 F.2d 465 (9th Cir. 1983). In Peterson, a father brought suit in federal \ncourt alleging state child welfare agencies violated his constitutional rights by depriving \n24 \nhim of visitation with his children. Id. Thus, the father was requesting relief from a single \ndecision of the child welfare agencies expressly subject to the juvenile courtโs jurisdiction \n25 \nand  review.  By  contrast,  Plaintiffs  are  not  challenging  particular  decisions  directly \napplicable in the juvenile court. The executive practices Plaintiffs challenge, for example, \n26 \ninclude not having effective systems in place to provide children with necessary care. \nAlthough one could, in the course of a dependency proceeding, ask a juvenile court to \n27 \nreview a specific agency decision regarding an individual child, the role of the court in \nthat specific instance would be to evaluate the constitutionality of the decision but not the \n28 \nconstitutionality of the agencyโs overall operating procedures, which affect all children in \nstate custody.  \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 20 of 30\n \n \n \n1  ability to order initial child placements or to review the adequacy of placements. (Doc. \n2  37). As such, the requested injunctive relief is not aimed at controlling the ultimate \n3  placement of individual children in a foster home. Those individual decisions are within \n4  the  sole  purview  and  oversight  of  the  juvenile  courts.  This  case  focuses  on  DCSโs \n5  processes for acquiring, screening, and licensing foster homes and its provision of enough \n6  foster homes to house children entrusted to its care. The decision of the Court will not \n7  disrupt individual placements or specific foster homes. See Sam M. ex rel. Elliott v. \n8  Chafee, 800 F. Supp. 2d 363, 380 (D.R.I. 2011) (holding โincrease[ing] the array and \n9  types of available placements, are not within the province of the Family Court, although \n10  they would assist in implementing the Family Courtโs orders. [And] [w]ith respect to \n11  those measures, โthe mere possibility of inconsistent results in the future is insufficient to \n12  justify Younger abstention.โโ). \n13    Visitation: Defendants argue because the juvenile courts have โbroad discretionโ \n14  to hear and decide issues of visitation, abstention is required. (Doc. 41 at 9, 17). The \n15  relief  requested  by  Plaintiffs  is  for  โDCS  [to]  establish  .  .  .  practices  providing  for \n16  minimally adequate visitation between [family] members.โ (Doc. 37).  \n17    DCS has an obligation to facilitate visitation between children, their siblings, and \n18  other family members, as long as the juvenile court has not declared it against the best \n19  interest  of  the  child.  A.R.S.  ยง  8-613(C)-(D).  In  keeping  with  this  obligation,  the \n20  permanency plan ordered or approved by the juvenile court at the disposition hearing \n21  must โtake[] into consideration the placement of the child with siblings or [] provide[] for \n22  frequent visitation or contact between siblings unless the court determines that either . . . \n23  would be contrary to the childโs or a siblingโs safety or well-being.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-845(C).  \n24    The complaint does not allege Defendants or the juvenile courts fail to include \n25  family visits in case plans. Rather, it discusses โpoor performance in coordinating family \n26  visitsโ  and  the  โ475  families  waiting  for  such  visitation  services.โ  (Doc.  37  at  46) \n27  (emphasis  added).  Like  systems  for  ensuring  the  availability  of  enough  quality \n28  placements for foster children, creating systems for effectively coordinating visitation for \n \n- 20 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 21 of 30\n \n \n \n1  foster children and their families does not require ordering visitation in individual cases. \n2  An injunctive order addressing the broad-based issues described in the complaint would \n3  focus on the resources available for facilitating visitation already deemed appropriate by \n4  DCS and the juvenile courts.  \n5    Healthcare Services: Defendants likewise argue the juvenile courts have โday-to-\n6  day oversightโ over the health care of foster children and, as such, the request for relief \n7  concerning health care services requires abstention. (Doc. 41 at 9, 17-18). Plaintiffs seek \n8  an order directing DCS, DHS, and AHCCCS to โestablish and implement practices to \n9  ensure that all members of the [putative class] receive the physical, mental and behavioral \n10  health  services  to  which  they  are  entitledโ  under  substantive  due  process  and  the \n11  Medicaid Act. (Doc. 37).  \n12    Defendants are presently obligated to provide foster children with a variety of \n13  healthcare services. And the juvenile courts may order additional services not specifically \n14  required by law, but which address the unique needs of a child serve the purpose of \n15  providing for the safety and best interest of the child. Juvenile courts may, in their \n16  discretion, order the parent, guardian or custodian of a child who โappears to be in need \n17  of medical or surgical careโ to provide treatment for a child. A.R.S. ยง 8-245(A). โIf the \n18  parent, guardian or custodian fails to provide the care as ordered, the juvenile court may \n19  enter an order therefor.โ A.R.S. ยง 8-245(A). The juvenile courts are also responsible for \n20  approving motions for psychiatric assessments and residential treatment services.  A.R.S. \n21  ยง 8-272(F), (D); A.R.S. ยง 8-273(A). DCS, DHS, and AHCCCS are also responsible not \n22  only for complying with orders from the juvenile courts, but also for independently \n23  planning and providing programs and services to protect the health and safety of Arizona \n24  children. See A.R.S. ยง 8-457. Specifically, DCS is obligated to provide โcomprehensive \n25  medical and dental careโ for foster children and to collaborate with DHS and AHCCCS \n26  to  find  the  most  effective  way  of  delivering  that  care  as  well  as  behavioral  health \n27  services. A.R.S. ยง 8-512(A)-(C). The agencies are also responsible for creating a system \n28  for identifying, licensing, and paying healthcare providers. A.R.S. ยง 8-512(D)-(K).  \n \n- 21 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 22 of 30\n \n \n \n1    The requested relief concerns the systems for facilitating the provision of care \n2  already deemed necessary by Defendants and the juvenile courts. DCS and its related \n3  agencies  are  responsible  for  creating  a  system  for  effectively  delivering  care.  This \n4  includes licensing and funding quality healthcare providers in a way that is similar to \n5  DCSโs responsibilities regarding provision of foster homes. Defendants have presented \n6  no evidence the juvenile courts play a specific role in directing or monitoring those \n7  functions.  An  injunction  directed  towards  the  establishment  and  implementation  of \n8  practices to ensure children receive healthcare services to which they are entitled does not \n9  require deciding an entitlement, but rather the delivering of entitled services.  \n10    Investigating  Abuse  and  Caseworker  Contact:  Defendants  make  no  claims \n11  regarding the request for relief aimed at investigating abuse and neglect or providing \n12  greater contact between caseworkers and biological parents, and these provisions involve \n13  no clear conflict or interference with the juvenile courts.  \n14    Power of Contempt: Defendants claim the relief sought targets compliance with \n15  juvenile court orders and as such interferes with the power of contempt and the ability of \n16  the court to enforce its orders. Defendants refer to instances in the complaint in which a \n17  juvenile court found lack of reasonable efforts to comply with orders as evidence that the \n18  requested relief would impose oversight over compliance with juvenile court orders. But \n19  the relief sought does not involve monitoring compliance with individual orders of the \n20  juvenile courts. Rather, the goal of the proposed relief is to oversee macro-level systems, \n21  which may involve overall rates of placement, visitation, and services. Furthermore, the \n22  purpose of the oversight is not to pinpoint individual cases of noncompliance for federal \n23  court intervention, but rather to implement system-wide remedial measures to help cure \n24  alleged chronic, widespread failures.  \n25  Defendants have not pointed to instances in which the juvenile courts have been \n26  involved with rooting out systemic causes of repeated agency failures. Nor do Defendants \n27  cite statutes imposing a duty on the courts to engage in such agency intervention. This \n28  type of federal oversight would not interfere with the functioning of the juvenile courts, \n \n- 22 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 23 of 30\n \n \n \n1  including the power of contempt. See M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d 712, 720 (S.D. Tex. \n2  2011) (โAs this lawsuit focuses on systemic problems and seeks systemic solutions, it \n3  would not โduplicateโ the individualized reviews that occur in the state courts.โ).  \n4    It is worth noting Juidice v. Vail, the case in which the Supreme Court first spoke \n5  of the contempt power of a state court as grounds for Younger abstention, was a direct \n6  challenge to the power of contempt. 430 U.S. 327 (1977). The plaintiffs in Juidice sought \n7  specifically to invalidate a state statute which gave the state court the power of contempt. \n8  The plaintiffs also sought to enjoin pending contempt proceedings. Id. In contrast to \n9  Juidice, the potential interference Defendants posit with respect to the present lawsuit is \n10  hypothetical.15 \n11    Retroactive  Effect:  Defendants  express  concern  that  any  finding  of  past \n12  constitutional  violations  by  DCS,  DHS,  or  AHCCCS  could  result  in  demands  for \n13  reversals or modifications of specific juvenile court orders in 16,990 pending dependency \n14  proceedings. (Doc. 49 at 11). Defendants rely on E.T. v. George, 681 F. Supp. 2d 1151, \n15  1172 (E.D. Cal. 2010). In E.T., a class of dependent children brought an action alleging \n16  attorney and judicial caseloads in dependency courts were excessive and violated federal \n17  and state constitutional and statutory provisions by frustrating โthe ability of the courts to \n18  adjudicate  and  provide  children  with  a  meaningful  opportunity  to  be  heard  and  the \n19  effective, adequate, and competent assistance of counsel.โ Id. The court concluded, โ[t]he \n20  requested declaratory relief call[ed] into question the validity of every decision made in \n21  pending and future dependency court cases before the resolution of this litigationโ and \n22  stated it โ[could not] overlook the practical impact of the proposed declaratory relief on \n23  the 5,100 active dependency court casesโ in which the court predicted parties would seek \n24 \n                                              \n25 \n15  In  those  instances  in  the  complaint  in  which  a  juvenile  court  found \n26 \nnoncompliance with an order, there is no indication the court exercised its power of \ncontempt. (See, e.g., Doc. 37 at 16-17). Rather, the complaint states, in some instances, \n27 \nthe juvenile court merely re-ordered the same relief previously directed. (Doc. 37 at 16-\n17). The Court โcannot overlook the practical impact of the proposed [] relief,โ which, \n28 \nhere, would not interfere with the functioning of the juvenile court. Cf. E.T. v. George, \n681 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1172 (E.D. Cal. 2010). \n \n- 23 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 24 of 30\n \n \n \n1  to invalidate prior decisions by the juvenile court. Id.16  \n2    Unlike E.T., the complaint and requested relief here do not call into question the \n3  validity  of  orders  previously  issued  by  the  juvenile  courts,  nor  the  fairness  of  past \n4  juvenile court proceedings. Plaintiffs do not claim, nor do Defendants argue, the alleged \n5  constitutional  violations  resulted  from  adherence  to  certain  juvenile  court  orders. \n6  Defendants  have  not  shown  how  findings  against  them  would  have  the  effect  of \n7  retroactively invalidating past orders of the juvenile courts. \n8    In sum, the relief sought in each of the areas outlined in the complaint does not \n9  involve or interfere with the interest of the state in enforcing the orders and judgments of \n10  state courts. The Court does note that although the suit clearly involves an important state \n11  interest,17 it does not appear Plaintiffs could raise their classwide claims or pursue the \n12  systemic reforms they seek within the framework of the periodic review hearings in the \n13 \n14 \n                                              \n15  16 The โpractical impactโ of such a declaration was not the primary reason for the \ndecision to abstain under Younger. The decision primarily rested on a finding that โ[the \n16 \nproposed] injunction directed to remedying [violations based upon the amount of time or \nresources spent on juvenile dependency court cases] would require the [federal] court to \n17 \nensure that in each case the child was receiving certain services or procedures that the \ncourt has declared constitutional.โ Id. (emphasis added). \n18 \n17 See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 766 (1982) (โthe State has an urgent \n19 \ninterest in the welfare of [its resident children]โ). See also Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, \n435, 99 S. Ct. 2371, 2383, 60 L. Ed. 2d 994 (1979) (โFamily relations are a traditional \n20 \narea of state concern.โ); Ginsberg v. State of New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968) (โState . . . \nhas an independent interest in the well-being of its youth.โ); Prince v. Commonwealth of \n21 \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944) (state acting to guard the interest in youthโs well-\nbeing); H.C. ex rel. Gordon v. Koppel, 203 F.3d 610, 613 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing Moore \n22 \non  stateโs  interest  in  family  relations).  Some  courts  have  held  a  stateโs  voluntary \nagreement to federal oversight of its foster care system under the Act reduces the comity \n23 \nconcerns out of which this requirement of Younger arose.  M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d \n712, 725 (S.D. Tex. 2011) (โ[G]eneral concerns about comity and federalism underlying \n24 \nYounger are lessened in light of the stateโs submission to federal oversight under the Title \nIV-E foster care program. . . . The voluntary submission to such federal oversight greatly \n25 \nlessens the force of any complaints regarding unwarranted federal intrusion on state \nsovereignty.โ). But the cases do not hold federal oversight negates the stateโs interest \n26 \nentirely. Id. at 721 (โThe mere fact that federal oversight also exists does not lessen the \nimportance of this state interest.โ). Cf. Hudson v. Campbell, 663 F.3d 985, 988 (8th Cir. \n27 \n2011) (holding state had important interest in administering Medicaid program because \nโ[t]he Act โconfers broad discretion on the States to adopt standards for determining the \n28 \nextent  of  medical assistance,  requiring  only  that  such  standards  be  โreasonableโ  and \nโconsistent with the objectivesโ of the Actโโ and program was partially funded by state). \n \n- 24 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 25 of 30\n \n \n \n1  juvenile courts.18 Therefore, even if the relief sought could be construed to interfere with \n2  some ongoing proceedings, Younger abstention is inappropriate given the inadequacy of \n3  those proceedings to adjudicate the relief sought here. \n4    C. OโShea Abstention  \n5    In addition to Younger abstention, Defendants invoke OโShea abstention. OโShea \n6  abstention is an outgrowth of Younger. Under OโShea v. Littleton, a federal court may not \n7  issue an injunction which would result in โan ongoing federal audit of state [court] \n8  proceedings which would indirectly accomplish the kind of interference that Younger v. \n9  Harris . . .  and related cases sought to prevent.โ 414 U.S. 488, 500 (1974).  \n10    OโShea involved an action by a group of residents against a county magistrate and \n11  associate judge of the county circuit court in which the residents alleged a pattern and \n12  practice of illegal bond setting, sentencing, and jury fee practices in criminal cases. 414 \n13  U.S. 488 (1974). The Supreme Court dismissed the case for lack of standing and want of \n14  an actual case or controversy. The Court held none of the named plaintiffs had suffered \n15  the injury specified and the claimed injury was outlined in far too general terms to be \n16  cognizable.  As  an  alternative  holding,  the  Court  stated  that  even  if  the  complaint \n17  presented a case or controversy, \n \n18 \n[The requested] injunction [was] aimed at controlling or preventing the \n19  occurrence of specific events that might take place in the course of future \nstate  criminal  trials[,]  .  .  .  would  contemplate  interruption  of  state \n20 \nproceedings to adjudicate assertions of noncompliance by petitioners[, and \n21  would result in] an ongoing federal audit of state criminal proceedings \nwhich would indirectly accomplish the kind of interference that Younger v. \n22 \n                                              \n23 \n18 As discussed in the previous section, everything about dependency proceedings \n24 \nis tailored to the specific facts and circumstances of a particular childโs life. Nothing in \nthe statutes governing the authority or procedures of the juvenile court envisions or \n25 \nauthorizes the courtโs adjudication of class action cases. See A.R.S. ยงยง 8-841 et seq.; 8-\n221. In fact, Defendants do not argue the class claims this case presents could be brought \n26 \nin the context of an ongoing juvenile dependency proceeding. Rather they argue the \nCourt does not need to analyze this case as a class action because no class has yet been \n27 \ncertified. Crucially, Defendants and the cases on which they rely, 31 Foster Children v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1281 (11th Cir. 2003) and Joseph A. ex rel. Corrine Wolfe v. \n28 \nIngram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1274 (10th Cir. 2002), do not embrace the unique and important \nfunctions of class actions and the relief they can afford. \n \n- 25 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 26 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Harris . . . and related cases sought to prevent. [And a] federal court should \nnot intervene to establish the basis for future intervention that would be so \n2 \nintrusive and unworkable. \n3 \nId. at 500.  \n4 \n5    OโShea abstention is an equitable abstention related to Younger. โIf the equitable \n6  relief requested requires intrusive follow-up into state court proceedings, it constitutes โa \n7  form of the monitoring of the operation of state court functions that is antipathetic to \n8  established principles of comity.โโ E.T. v. George, 681 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1162 (E.D. Cal. \n9  2010) affโd sub nom. E.T. v. Cantil-Sakauye, 682 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting \n10  OโShea, 441 U.S. at 500). \n11    โ[I]nstitutional  reform  injunctions  often  raise  sensitive  federalism  concerns.โ \n12  Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 448 (2009). Those concerns are โheightened when . . . a \n13  federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.โ Id. To \n14  fulfill their obligation of enforcing federal law without overly hamstringing state and \n15  local officials with โoverbroad or outdated [federal injunctive orders]โ the Supreme Court \n16  directed federal courts to take a โflexible approachโ to such orders, ensuring the orders \n17  are  โlimited  to  reasonable  and  necessary  implementations  of  federal  lawโ  and \n18  โresponsibility for discharging the Stateโs obligations is returned promptly to the State \n19  and its officials when the circumstances warrant.โ Id. at 450 (internal quotation marks \n20  and citation omitted). \n21    Defendants claim the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek โnecessarily requires this \n22  Court to create and then monitor, for purposes of enforcement, measurable criteria for \n23  placements,  visitation,  permanency,  health  care,  and  other  facets  of  foster  care  that \n24  juvenile court judges adjudicate,โ and would thus constitute an ongoing federal audit of \n25  juvenile court proceedings. (Doc. 49 at 18). Plaintiffs insist โDefendants can be ordered \n26  to  address  their  harmful  practices  โwithout  an  ongoing  intrusion  into  the  stateโs \n27  administration of justice,โโ and โOโShea does not give federal courts license to turn away \n28  from claims like those asserted in this action.โ (Doc. 42 at 28). \n \n- 26 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 27 of 30\n \n \n \n1    In E.T. v. Cantil-Sakauye, the Ninth Circuit affirmed an abstention decision under \n2  OโShea. 682 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). There, the district court was asked to declare \n3  attorney caseloads in juvenile courts unconstitutional and issue accompanying injunctive \n4  relief. The court concluded: \n5  [T]he court would [] have to consider a myriad of administrative matters \nthat affect the efficiency of the system. Further, in order to enforce any \n6 \nmethod of injunctive relief, the court would be required to act as a receiver \n7  for the Sacramento dependency court system, ensuring that judges were \ngiving  adequate  time  to  each  individualized  case  pursuant  to  the \n8 \nconstitutional and/or statutory dictates established through this proceeding. \n9  Such  involvement  in  any  state  institutional  system  is  daunting,  but  the \nproblems  accompanying  plaintiffsโ  requested  relief  is  increased \n10 \nexponentially when applied to a state judicial system. \n11  E.T. v. George, 681 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1165 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (emphasis added). \n12    The Ninth Circuit distinguished Los Angeles County Bar Association v. Eu, 979 \n13  F.2d 697 (9th Cir. 1992), which involved a challenge to a California statute prescribing \n14  the number of judges in Los Angeles Superior Court. The plaintiffs in that case claimed \n15  the statute led to a shortage of state court judges, which in turn, caused inordinate delays \n16  in civil litigation and deprived litigants of access to the courts. The E.T. court held the \n17  question  in  Los  Angeles  County  Bar  Association  was  โwhether  the  average  time  to \n18  resolution in a case violated [the plaintiffโs] rights.โ E.T., 681 F. Sup. 2d at 1166. By \n19  contrast,  the  court  held  the  question  presented  in  E.T.  was  whether  each  individual \n20  plaintiffโs rights had been violated โbased upon their specific, individual circumstances.โ \n21  Id. \n22    But in Melendres v. Maricopa County, a district court did not abstain in a class \n23  action seeking federal monitoring and sweeping reforms of a state executive agency, the \n24  Maricopa County Sheriffโs Office. No. CV-07-2513-PHX-GMS, 2009 WL 2707241, at \n25  *5 (D. Ariz. Aug. 24, 2009). The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, \n26  arguing in part, that the principles of comity and federalism made adjudication of the \n27  claims in federal court improper. The court referenced OโShea but held: \n28 \n \n \n- 27 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 28 of 30\n \n \n \n1  [P]rinciples of federalism counsel restraint in the granting of injunctive \nrelief against state agencies. At this early stage in the litigation, however, \n2 \nprinciples of federalism do not dictate that the Court should terminate this \n3  case. Just as it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say \nwhat the law is, . . . so too is it emphatically the province and duty of the \n4 \njudiciary to vindicate the law where it has been violated. This principle \n5  requires enjoining constitutional violations that are likely to reoccur, even if \nthe subject of the injunction is a state agency entitled to respect, deference, \n6 \nand latitude in conducting its own affairs. . . . Principles of federalism are \n7  not offended by a court performing this essential functionโโto conclude \notherwise  would  be  to  suggest  that  federal  courts  never  ought  to  be \n8 \nconcerned with the activities of state agencies under any circumstances.โ \n9 \n10  Id. at *5 (citations omitted). Melendres did not involve ongoing state court proceedings, \n11  but the holding is relevant because it clearly outlines the tension between Supreme Court \n12  precedents which, on the one hand, impose a duty on federal courts to adjudicate claims \n13  arising under federal laws, and on the other hand, warn against excessive intrusion into \n14  the operation of state government. The Supreme Court also addressed that tension in \n15  Horne when it discussed the โflexible approachโ federal courts should take to address \n16  widespread violations of federal law by state institutions. 557 U.S. at 450. \n17    The  primary  question  under  OโShea  is  whether  the  proposed  injunctive  relief \n18  would result in an ongoing federal audit of state court proceedings. The complaint here \n19  does not. It is directed towards state agencies. Defendants express concern the obligation \n20  of juvenile courts to oversee these agencies will result in a federal injunction which will \n21  indirectly accomplish the interference Younger aims to avoid. But as discussed, although \n22  the juvenile courts play a significant role in overseeing the care of children within the \n23  custody and care of the Arizona child welfare agencies, the courts are not involved in \n24  adjudicating and remedying the types of claims raised here. \n25    The complaint and proposed relief are distinguishable from E.T. because they are \n26  not directly aimed at the functioning of the juvenile courts.19 Plaintiffs here do not allege \n                                              \n27 \n19 For this reason, the case is also distinguishable from Laurie Q. v. Contra Costa \n28 \nCounty, another case on which Defendants rely. In Laurie Q., a class of special needs \nfoster children sued the county for violations of the Adoption Assistance and Child \n \n- 28 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 29 of 30\n \n \n \n1  any  statutory  or  constitutional  violations  in  the  procedure  or  administration  of  the \n2  juvenile courts. Nor is Plaintiffsโ suit an indictment of the juvenile courts for failing to \n3  address these constitutional issues.  \n4    Further, the failures of child welfare agencies to comply with juvenile court orders \n5  are the result of the broader problems Plaintiffs wish to address. Plaintiffs contend the \n6  absence of proper agency organization and resources results in constitutional violations, \n7  signified by insufficient delivery of services to foster children, including instances of \n8  direct violations of juvenile court orders, and those childrenโs mental and physical health \n9  problems. If appropriate, the success of the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek in this case \n10  will  be  measured  by  composite  statistics  showing  rates  of  placements  and  services, \n11  including those ordered by juvenile courts.  \n12    As the Melendres court held, principles of federalism and comity warrant restraint \n13  and respect when the target of a federal court injunction is a state agency. But this Court, \n14  like that one, is fully capable of practicing such restraint and hewing to the direction \n15  provided by the Supreme Court in Horne for managing the competing requirements of \n16  federal jurisdiction and state sovereignty.  \n17  III. Pullman Abstention \n18    Defendants also claim abstention is appropriate because Plaintiffsโ claims could be \n19  resolved on state law grounds, thus avoiding unwarranted determinations of federal law. \n20  Plaintiffs argue there are no state grounds upon which to decide the issues they raise \n21  since they do not challenge the constitutionality or appropriateness of a state law or \n22  policy. \n23    In Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Company, the Supreme Court held \n24 \n                                                                                                                                                  \n25 \nWelfare Act (โAACWAโ), including failing to prepare compliant case plans. 304 F. \nSupp. 2d 1185 (N.D. Cal. 2004). Because the juvenile court held โultimate authority over \n26 \nthe formulation of the case plans . . . [at] which plaintiffsโ prayer for injunctive relief \n[was] directedโ . . . the court held Younger applied. Id. at 1203-08 (โ[T]he allegations at \n27 \nissue  here  reach  to  the  very  heart  of  the  Juvenile  Courtโs  responsibility  and  core \ncompetency,  viz.,  determining  the  best  program  of  services  and  placement  for  each \n28 \nindividual child.โ). As discussed at length in this order, the relief Plaintiffsโ seek is not \naimed at a core competency of the juvenile court. \n \n- 29 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 51   Filed 09/29/15   Page 30 of 30\n \n \n \n1  that  when  an  unsettled  question  of  state  law  could  be  dispositive  of  a  federal \n2  constitutional claim, the federal court should abstain in order to give the state courts an \n3  opportunity  to  decide  the  underlying  state  law  question,  thus  avoiding  unnecessary \n4  adjudication of constitutional questions. 312 U.S. 496 (1941).  \n5    Plaintiffs  do  not  raise  state  law  claims  in  their  complaint.  Although  it  is  not \n6  necessary for them to raise a state law claim in order to be subject to abstention under \n7  Pullman, Defendants have not provided the Court with a state law basis under which \n8  Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims might be resolved. Cf. Harris Cnty. Commโrs Court v. \n9  Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 81 (1975). Therefore, the Court cannot conclude Pullman abstention \n10  is appropriate. \n11  IV. Summary \n12    Obviously,  as  this  Order  demonstrates,  the  discussion  and  final  decision  of \n13  whether a federal court should entertain suits related to state judicial proceedings can \n14  never be marginalized. But in the end, if the Court abstained here, the effect would be \n15  that Plaintiffs would not be allowed to seek relief in federal court for alleged egregious \n16  broad  and  systemic  federal  constitutional  violations.  That  would  be  a  wrong  result \n17  because based on the allegations in the complaint, this Court could fashion a remedy that \n18  would not impinge upon the decisions made by juvenile courts in specific individual \n19  cases. And of course, this Court will always eschew forays into state judicial proceedings.  \n20    Accordingly, \n21    IT IS ORDERED the motion to abstain and dismiss, (Doc. 41), is DENIED. \n22    Dated this 29th day of September, 2015. \n23   \n24   \n25 \nHonorable Roslyn O.

This is a civil rights class action brought by the Named Plaintiffs, children in \n5  Arizona state foster care custody, on behalf of themselves, a general class of children who \n6  are or will be placed in such custody following reports that they have suffered child abuse \n7  or neglect, and certain subclasses of these children. \n8  2. Plaintiffs are among the Stateโs most vulnerable citizens.  Through no fault of \n9  their own, they find themselves in the legal custody of the State after having already \n10  suffered the trauma of being abused or neglected by their own families.  Plaintiffs seek \n11  declaratory and injunctive relief to end certain child welfare policies and practices \n12  described herein exposing them to yet further physical and emotional harm and \n13  unreasonable risk of harm while in the Stateโs care.   \n14  3. On May 29, 2014, legislation was enacted giving responsibility for the stateโs \n15  child welfare operations to the state Department of Child Safety (โDCSโ) and removing \n16  such responsibility from the state Department of Economic Security (โDESโ).   As of May \n17  29, 2014, DCS, which was established as an independent agency, is legally responsible for \n18  managing  the stateโs child welfare system. \n19  4. Plaintiffs name Gregory McKay, the Director of DCS, as a defendant.  Defendant \n20  McKay, who is sued solely in his official capacity, directly and indirectly controls and is \n21  responsible for the policies and practices of DCS, including those set forth herein.   \n22  5. Plaintiffs also name Cara M. Christ, M.D., the Director of the state Department \n23  of Health Services (โDHSโ),  as a defendant.  DHS is responsible for providing mental and \n24  behavioral health services to children in Arizona state foster care custody.  Defendant \n25  Christ, who is sued solely in her official capacity, directly and indirectly controls and is \n26  responsible for the policies and practices of DHS, including those set forth herein.   \n27  6. Plaintiffs also name Thomas J. Betlach, the Director of the Arizona Health Care \n28  Cost Containment System (โAHCCCSโ),  as a defendant.  AHCCCS is responsible for \n2\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 3 of 53\n1  administering and supervising the Medicaid program in Arizona.  Defendant Betlach, who \n2  is sued solely in his official capacity, directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for \n3  the stateโs compliance with Medicaidโs statutory and regulatory requirements. \n4  7. Over the past several years, while foster care rates across the nation have been on \n5  the decline, Arizona has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of children in state \n6  foster care.  From 2003 to 2012, the number of children in the Stateโs foster care custody \n7  nearly doubled.  More recently, Arizonaโs foster care population grew from 10,207 as of \n8  March 31, 2010 to 15,037 as of September 2013, a 47.3% increase.  The number of \n9  children in out-of-home care grew by another 10% from February 2013 to February 2014.  \n10  As of September 30, 2014, there are 16,990 children in state foster care custody who have \n11  been placed in out-of-home care.    \n12  8. This huge growth in the stateโs foster care population has been fueled by \n13  extensive state budget cuts to important support services that had previously helped keep \n14  families together.  In particular, state funding for DESโs contracts with community-based \n15  providers who offered in-home services to children, aimed at making removal of children \n16  into foster care unnecessary, was cut in half in recent years, from $43 million in fiscal year \n17  2008 to under $22 million in fiscal year 2012.   \n18  9. These cuts followed the stateโs termination of its Family Builders program in \n19  2004, which had provided family-centered assessments, case management, and services for \n20  families with children deemed to be at low or only potential risk of being abused or \n21  neglected.    \n22  10. According to the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics \n23  โ[c]uts to DES family support services including child care assistance, housing assistance, \n24  substance-abuse treatment and job training for families has resulted in a 40% increase in \n25  the number of children who needed to be placed in foster care since 2009 and these \n26  children are staying in foster care longer because their parents are not provided with the \n27  services they need.โ \n28 \n3\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 4 of 53\n1  11. As former Governor Brewer publicly acknowledged  in 2014, the Arizona โchild \n2  welfare system is broken, impeded by years of structural and operational failures.โ  \n3  Defendants DCS and DHS (collectively the โDefendantsโ)  are legally responsible for \n4  overseeing this โbrokenโ system. \n5  12. Defendants are well aware that the following structural and operational failures \n6  continue to plague the stateโs child welfare system: \n7  ๏ท  A severe shortage in and inaccessibility of physical, mental and \nbehavioral health services available to children in state care.  As a result, \n8  far too many children in state foster care custody do not receive the health \ncare services they desperately need and all children in state care are subject \n9 \nto an unreasonable risk that they will suffer physical and emotional harm and \ndeterioration while in the stateโs care.  \n10 \n๏ท  A widespread failure to conduct timely investigations of reports that \n11  children have been maltreated while in state foster care custody.  As a \nresult of the stateโs deficient investigation practices, children in state foster \n12 \ncare custody are placed at an undue risk of suffering physical and emotional \nharm while in state care.    \n13 \n๏ท  A severe and sustained shortage of family foster homes.  As a result of \n14 \nthis shortage, children in state foster care are emotionally harmed and \nsubjected to an unreasonable risk of harm by being placed far from their \n15 \nfamilies and communities, separated from their siblings, and forced to \nexperience disruptive school changes.    \n16 \n๏ท  A widespread failure to engage in basic child welfare practices aimed at \n17 \nmaintaining family relationships, such as placing siblings together, \nplacing children with their biological parents on a trial reunification \n18 \nbasis, coordinating visits between children in state foster care and their \nbiological families, and having caseworkers make regular visits with the \n19 \nchildrenโs biological parents to monitor progress toward family \n20  reunification.  These failures subject children in state foster care to an \nunreasonable risk of suffering emotional harm while in state care. Moreover, \n21  as a result of these deficiencies, children are subjected to unreasonable \ndelays in being reunified with their families, causing them to suffer further \n22  emotional harm. \n23  13. The state child welfare agency and DHS have failed to remedy these ongoing \n24  failures.  \n25  14. Moreover, Arizona officials have long been aware of these deficiencies and \n26  harms.  As far back as 2003, the Maricopa County Attorneyโs Office released a report on \n27  the stateโs child welfare system, In Harmโs Way, detailing the systemโs deficiencies.  \n28  Among its findings, the report identified a shortage of foster homes and stated that โ[p]art \n4\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 5 of 53\n1  of the reason many feel that children stay in a โriskyโ situation is the inability to place them \n2  elsewhere.โ  The report concluded that the stateโs child welfare system was โoverloaded \n3  without the proper resources to ensure the safety of all children.โ \n4  15. That same year, then Governor Janet Napolitano acknowledged that โ[t]he \n5  system for protecting Arizonaโs children from abuse and neglect, which has been falling \n6  apart for years due to poor design and chronic under-funding,  is in critical need of repair.โ  \n7  Governor Napolitano convened an โAdvisory  Commission on CPS Reformโ that issued an \n8  Action Plan for Reform of Arizonaโs Child Protection System in September 2003 (the \n9  โAction Planโ).  The Action Plan noted several systemic deficiencies in the stateโs child \n10  welfare system, including a shortage of foster homes and limited access to services for \n11  foster children. \n12  16. In the years since In Harmโs Way and the Action Plan were released, the child \n13  welfare system has continued to suffer from a vast shortage of foster homes and inadequate \n14  access to child services, despite the known harm that these structural impairments have \n15  caused children in state foster care to suffer.     \n16  17. As a result of the stateโs failure to remedy these problems, plaintiffs have been, \n17  and continue to be, exposed to harm and an unreasonable risk of harm, in violation of their \n18  federal constitutional and statutory rights. \n19  JURISDICTION  AND VENUE \n20  18. This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress violations of the \n21  United States Constitution and the provisions of the federal Medicaid Act, including \n22  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and 1396d(r), that \n23  require states to provide early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment (โEPSDTโ) \n24  services.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and \n25  authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202.   \n26  19. Venue is proper here pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because the claims arise \n27  in this district. \n28   \n5\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 6 of 53\n1  PARTIES \n2  A.  The Named Plaintiffs \n3  B.K. \n4  20. As of February 3, 2015, B.K. is a ten-year-old girl in state foster care with a \n5  permanency goal of permanent foster care, meaning that DCS has concluded that she has \n6  little, if any, chance of leaving foster care over the next eight years.  She has spent more \n7  than half of her life in state foster care.  During her time in state foster care, B.K. has been \n8  deprived of needed physical and mental health care, separated from her siblings, deprived \n9  of contact with her mother and siblings, and placed in institutional settings on two different \n10  occasions.  As a result of these experiences, B.K. has been subjected to emotional harm \n11  and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n12  21. B.K. first entered voluntary state custody in 2005 when she was five months \n13  old.  At that time, B.K.โs mother had a substance abuse problem and could not care for her.  \n14  B.K. remained in the legal custody of the state child welfare agency until September 2006 \n15  when she was returned to her mother. \n16  22. In 2008, then three-year-old B.K. and her three siblings were removed from \n17  their motherโs home.  Upon assuming their care, the state child welfare agency \n18  immediately separated the four siblings, placing B.K. and her brother in a licensed foster \n19  home, and their two sisters in a second foster home.  In late 2009, the state child welfare \n20  agency returned B.K. and her siblings to their motherโs care. \n21  23. In 2012, B.K. and her three siblings were again removed from their motherโs \n22  home and placed in state foster care custody.  Upon coming into state care for the third \n23  time, B.K. was diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (โPTSDโ),  a mood disorder, \n24  psychosis and anxiety.  An investigation showed that B.K. had been physically abused by \n25  her mother, and had bumps and bruises on her head and behind her ears.   \n26  24. Despite her fragile emotional state, the state child welfare agency separated \n27  B.K. from all of her siblings, placing her in a group home on โemergency shelterโ status.  \n28 \n6\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 7 of 53\n1  Though such placements are supposed to be short-term, B.K. remained at the group home \n2  for more than two years.   \n3  25. While at the group home, the state child welfare agency failed to ensure that \n4  B.K. obtained the glasses she needed to see properly.  The state child welfare agency also \n5  failed to discover that B.K. was walking  with a limp, and failed to make sure that she \n6  received the orthopedic shoes she needed.  Despite months of complaints from B.K. about \n7  a toothache, the state child welfare agency failed to make sure she saw a dentist while she \n8  was living at the group home.    \n9  26. From the time B.K. was placed at the group home in 2012 until early 2014, the \n10  state child welfare agency and DHS also failed to ensure that B.K. received consistent \n11  counseling and needed mental health services.  During this time, B.K. was saying that she \n12  was hearing voices that were telling her to hurt other people or that someone would die.  \n13  One time she was so scared by the voices that she called the police.  The state child \n14  welfare agency knew that the group home was failing to arrange for B.K.โs transportation \n15  to appointments with health care providers, but failed to see to it that B.K. received \n16  undisrupted services.  The group home also enrolled B.K. in a specialized school where \n17  she was the only girl. \n18  27. In May 2014, the state child welfare agency finally placed B.K. in a foster home \n19  after she had spent 25 months in the group home.  The state child welfare agency placed \n20  her with a man and his great-nephew who went to the same specialized school as B.K.  \n21  The man told the state child welfare agency that he was concerned about B.K.โs mental \n22  health and asked the state to make sure she received an updated psychological evaluation.  \n23  The last complete evaluation had been conducted five years earlier when B.K. was four.  \n24  The updated assessment was never performed.  After only eight weeks, B.K. was moved to \n25  a second foster home with neighbors of the man and his great-nephew.  After two weeks at \n26  this second home, the foster parents packed up B.K.โs things and dropped her off at a DCS \n27  office. \n28 \n7\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 8 of 53\n1  28. In August 2014, DCS moved B.K. to a shelter.  The move to shelter care caused \n2  B.K. to have to change schools, resulting in educational and social disruption.  Moreover, \n3  the counselor who had been treating B.K. at the group home refused to drive to see B.K. at \n4  the shelter because of the distance involved, and DCS again failed to ensure that B.K. \n5  received transportation to her counseling sessions. \n6  29. During August 2014, B.K.โs behavioral health coordinator concluded that B.K. \n7  should be placed in a โHome Care Training to Home Care Client Servicesโ (โHCTCโ) \n8  therapeutic foster home.  No such placement was made and B.K. remained in a shelter \n9  until September.  While at the shelter, B.K. had no contact with her mother or three older \n10  siblings, even though her siblings have been returned to their motherโs care.  B.K.โs mental \n11  health deteriorated at the shelter and she threatened to hurt herself and others.  She was \n12  admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a week to be stabilized.   \n13  30. In late September 2014, DCS moved B.K. from the hospital to a non-therapeutic \n14  foster home.  This resulted in another change in schools.  DCS did not ensure that she had \n15  regular contact with her mother or siblings.  \n16  31. In December 2014, still waiting to be placed in an HCTC home, B.K. had \n17  another psychiatric crisis and threatened suicide.  The state child welfare agency moved \n18  her out of the foster home and DHS admitted her to another psychiatric hospital.  She \n19  stayed in the hospital for a week and a half.   \n20  32. In late December, months after her providers agreed she needed a therapeutic \n21  foster home, B.K. was finally discharged from the hospital to an HCTC placement.  This \n22  resulted in yet another change in schools.     \n23  C.P.  \n24  33. As of February 3, 2015, C.P. is a seven-year-old boy who has been in state \n25  foster care custody since June 2013, with a permanency goal of adoption.  During his time \n26  in state foster care, he has attended at least eight different schools and has had to live in at \n27  least 11 different placements, including two stays in shelters and a placement in a foster \n28  home where he was physically abused.  While in state foster care, he has been separated \n8\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 9 of 53\n1  from his siblings, deprived of visits with them, and has been deprived of access to both the \n2  mental health services and placements he desperately needs.  As a result of these \n3  experiences, C.P. has been subjected to physical and emotional harm and/or an ongoing \n4  unreasonable risk of harm. \n5  34. C.P. and his two sisters were taken into state foster care custody after being \n6  exposed to neglect and domestic violence.  They were initially placed in an unlicensed \n7  foster home for four days before being moved to their grandmotherโs home.  During the \n8  two-month period that C.P. was with his grandmother, she repeatedly asked the state child \n9  welfare agency for help with C.P.โs mental health needs, but C.P. did not receive any \n10  mental health care services.  Ultimately, his grandmother asked the state child welfare \n11  agency to remove C.P. and his siblings from her home. \n12  35. The state child welfare agency then separated C.P. and his older sister from their \n13  younger sister. C.P. and his older sister were placed in a Spanish-speaking  foster home, \n14  even though the children do not speak Spanish.  The home was almost an hour away from \n15  C.P.โs grandmother and the foster home where C.P.โs younger sister was placed.  Within \n16  ten days of arriving at the Spanish-speaking  foster home, C.P. and his older sister were \n17  separated and placed in two different foster homes.   \n18  36. In early September 2013, the state child welfare agency moved C.P. to yet \n19  another foster home.  After months in foster care, C.P. was belatedly assigned a therapist.  \n20  Even then, however,  C.P.โs foster mother refused to take C.P. to his appointments  and the \n21  state child welfare agency and DHS failed to arrange for other transportation.  As a result, \n22  C.P. did not have a single therapy session during the four months he lived at the foster \n23  home.  \n24  37. The foster mother was also reported to the state Child Abuse Hotline, to C.P.โs \n25  DES case manager and to the state licensing office, after she placed C.P. in the front seat \n26  of her car without a car seat or booster seat.  DCS did not conduct an investigation of these \n27  reports.  Moreover, the case manager acknowledged that she had made an earlier report to \n28 \n9\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 10 of 53\n1  the Child Abuse Hotline herself when it was discovered that the foster mother had left C.P. \n2  unsupervised with another foster child.  DCS did not investigate that report either.  \n3  38. In January 2014, C.P. began visiting at another home where his older sister was \n4  living.  When his foster mother failed to pick him up from a visit, the state child welfare \n5  agency simply told the family whom C.P. was visiting to keep him.  C.P. subsequently \n6  disclosed that his former foster mother had hit him with a spoon.  Though  the state child \n7  welfare agency investigated the reported abuse, DCS never entered any investigation \n8  findings into the agencyโs Childrenโs Information Library and Data Source (โCHILDSโ) \n9  system, nor did the state child welfare agency close the investigation.  \n10  39. C.P. started living at the new foster home with his older sister in January 2014.  \n11  Shortly thereafter, he became suicidal.  Though  he had a crisis stabilization team in place, \n12  it failed to promptly respond to this crisis, and the foster mother called the police who took \n13  C.P. to the hospital.  C.P. did not see his older sister again for nearly a year. \n14  40. C.P. was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a week.  He was diagnosed with \n15  PTSD and his doctors indicated that he needed immediate intensive trauma therapy and \n16  specialized therapy at a therapeutic HCTC home.  C.P.โs stabilization team agreed that \n17  C.P. needed to be placed in a foster home equipped to respond to his needs. Nevertheless, \n18  when C.P. left the hospital, the state child welfare agency took him directly to a shelter.  \n19  He spent ten days in that shelter before being moved to a second shelter, a move that also \n20  resulted in C.P. having  to change schools.   \n21  41. In February 2014, three weeks after arriving at the second shelter, C.P. became \n22  suicidal again, telling staff about his plan to get a knife and hurt himself.  He was \n23  hospitalized for a second time and prescribed psychotropic medication.  He remained in \n24  the hospital for two weeks before being discharged in March 2014.  Again, the doctors at \n25  the psychiatric hospital recommended that C.P. be released to a therapeutic HCTC home.   \n26  42. Instead, the state child welfare agency placed C.P. in a non-therapeutic foster \n27  home.  C.P. had to switch schools again and was inappropriately placed in first grade \n28  instead of kindergarten, where he should have been enrolled based on his age and school \n10\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 11 of 53\n1  experience.  He stayed in first grade for a month before anyone realized he was in the \n2  wrong grade.   \n3  43. In April 2014, the state child welfare agency finally placed C.P. in an HCTC \n4  home.  Unfortunately, he was required to switch schools again as a result of this latest \n5  placement.  \n6  44. In December 2014, both of C.P.โs two sisters were adopted.  During the year \n7  before they were adopted, C.P. had only one sibling visit with one of his sisters, even \n8  though his mental health assessments indicate that his sisters are the only people with \n9  whom he has meaningful attachments.  Moreover, as of February 3, 2015, not only has he \n10  had no contact with either of them since they were adopted, but he has not received the \n11  intensive trauma therapy that was recommended for him in January 2014, and because his \n12  HCTC placement is temporary, his providers have decided that he should not receive \n13  intensive trauma therapy until he is in a more stable home.   \n14  B.T. \n15  45. As of February 3, 2015, B.T. is a fourteen-year-old boy diagnosed with PTSD \n16  who has a permanency goal of adoption. During his many years in state foster care \n17  custody, he has been shuffled through numerous institutional settings despite his young \n18  age, separated from his siblings, denied sibling visitation, deprived of much needed mental \n19  health care, and has had to endure repeated educational disruptions.  As a result of these \n20  experiences, B.T. has been subjected to emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable \n21  risk of harm. \n22  46. In January 2005, B.T. was taken into foster care for the first time, along with his \n23  two older brothers.  B.T. and one of his older brothers were placed together in a group \n24  home, and the other brother was separated and placed in a different group home.   \n25  47. A month after being taken into state foster care, B.T. had a psychological \n26  evaluation, which indicated that he needed therapeutic treatment.  He had to wait six \n27  months before his first therapy session. \n28 \n11\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 12 of 53\n1  48. In June 2005, B.T. was removed from the group home and separated from the \n2  brother with whom he was placed there.  He was moved to a kinship foster home with a \n3  paternal aunt.  By December 2005, B.T. had spent six months in his new home without any \n4  visits with his older brothers.  He did not see his brothers again until January 2006. \n5  49. In August 2006, B.T.โs aunt told the state child welfare agency that B.T. was not \n6  receiving the counseling that he needed.  She requested that B.T. have an updated \n7  psychological evaluation, but no such evaluation was conducted.  During this same time \n8  period, the state child welfare agency was again failing to provide B.T. with regular visits \n9  with one of his brothers. \n10  50. In September 2006, B.T.โs aunt told the state child welfare agency that she \n11  could no longer care for B.T. since the state was not providing him with the mental health \n12  services he needed.  Rather than DHS providing those services, the state child welfare \n13  agency moved B.T. to an emergency receiving foster home.   \n14  51. In October 2006, B.T. threatened to kill himself and the foster family with \n15  whom he was temporarily placed.  Despite his mounting mental health issues, B.T. still \n16  was not receiving regular therapy.  The state child welfare agency responded to this latest \n17  crisis by removing B.T. from the home.  B.T., then six years old, was again placed in a \n18  group home.   \n19  52. Shortly thereafter, the state child welfare agency received reports that B.T. was \n20  struggling emotionally in the group home.  Again, an updated psychological evaluation for \n21  B.T. was requested, but the evaluation was not scheduled until December 2006.  The state \n22  child welfare agency and DHS also failed during this time to ensure that B.T. received \n23  needed counseling.  \n24  53. B.T.โs evaluation indicated that he needed individual therapy every other week.  \n25  He was also prescribed psychotropic medication.  A psycho-educational evaluation was \n26  recommended, but never conducted. \n27 \n28 \n12\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 13 of 53\n1  54. In January 2008, B.T. was placed in a pre-adoptive home with one of his \n2  brothers.  A month later, the family told the state child welfare agency that B.T. needed \n3  more intensive counseling and a different counselor who could better meet B.T.โs needs.   \n4  55. In August 2008, both B.T. and his brother were adopted.  In March 2011, \n5  however, they were both taken back into state foster care.  Shortly after this occurred, B.T. \n6  reported that his adoptive father had been beating him with a belt.   \n7  56. The state child welfare agency immediately separated B.T. from his brother, \n8  placing the two boys in different non-therapeutic group homes.  The group home where \n9  B.T. was placed told the state child welfare agency that B.T. desperately needed \n10  counseling.  Despite this, B.T. did not receive any counseling while at the group home.   \n11  57. A month after being brought back into state foster care, B.T. was hospitalized in \n12  an acute care mental health facility for two weeks.  After leaving the hospital, the state \n13  child welfare agency returned B.T. to the group home. \n14  58. Once back at the group home in May 2011, B.T.โs mental health worsened.  \n15  DHS approved B.T. for a therapeutic HCTC placement, but did not have one available for \n16  him.   \n17  59. Stuck in the group home, B.T. responded by trying to run away.  B.T. spent the \n18  night at a juvenile detention center.  In that one night, his group home filled his open bed \n19  with another child.  As a consequence, the state child welfare agency moved B.T. to a new \n20  group home hours away from his prior placement. \n21  60. In July 2011, B.T. was moved to an HCTC home, but he was still not receiving \n22  trauma therapy and no psycho-sexual evaluation had been completed, despite one having \n23  been recommended months earlier.  It was not until October 2011 that a psycho-sexual \n24  evaluation was conducted.   \n25  61. During April 2012, the state child welfare agency and DHS began looking for \n26  another HCTC placement to better meet B.T.โs needs.  Unable to find one, the state child \n27  welfare agency instead moved him to a non-therapeutic group home/shelter in August \n28  2012.  By October 2012, B.T. reported โI feel like I get tossed around like a bag of chips.โ  \n13\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 14 of 53\n1  He threatened to kill himself three times while in this non-therapeutic congregate care \n2  placement.  \n3  62. In November 2012, the shelter told the state child welfare agency that B.T. \n4  needed a higher level of care.  The next month he was moved again, this time to a \n5  therapeutic group home.  While placed there, B.T. continued to express suicidal thoughts.  \n6  63. In January 2013, B.T. was returned to the same non-therapeutic group \n7  home/shelter that had told the state just two months earlier that B.T. needed a higher level \n8  of care.  B.T. remained at that shelter for a few more weeks before the state child welfare \n9  agency moved him again to a therapeutic group home two hours from his home \n10  community.  In May 2013, the brother with whom B.T. was adopted in 2008 was placed in \n11  a pre-adoptive placement with a family that ultimately adopted him.  B.T. felt defeated and \n12  said he thought he would never get out of the group home.  The following month, B.T. \n13  grabbed the steering wheel of a van driven by group home staff, saying, โI want us all to \n14  die.โ  That same day, the stateโs therapeutic team coordinating B.T.โs behavioral health \n15  services reported that โwith a few exceptions, B.T. is doing well over the last 2 weeks.โ \n16  64. Following the apparent suicide attempt, B.T.โs treating psychiatrist \n17  recommended that B.T. be placed in a residential treatment facility.  An application was \n18  made the following month.  While that request was pending, the state child welfare agency \n19  moved B.T. to another therapeutic group home far from his home county.  In September \n20  2013, the state child welfare agency moved B.T. to yet another therapeutic group home. \n21  65. In March 2014, the state child welfare agency moved B.T. to a non-therapeutic \n22  family foster home, but this placement disrupted after DHS failed to provide B.T. with any \n23  therapy to support his transition to a family home.  In July 2014, B.T. was moved to \n24  another non-therapeutic foster home.  By September, B.T. had only had a single therapy \n25  session.   \n26  66.  In October, DCS moved B.T. to a shelter where he stayed for more than a \n27  month.  B.T. did not receive any therapy sessions in the placement.  In early November, \n28  his Child and Family Team (โCFTโ)  recommended and the state child welfare agency and \n14\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 15 of 53\n1  DHS approved B.T. for a therapeutic HCTC placement.  No such placement was made.  \n2  Instead, DCS placed B.T. in another therapeutic group home.   \n3  67. Almost every time the state child welfare agency has moved B.T. over the last \n4  three and a half years, he had to go to a new school.   \n5  68. In December 2014, B.T. threatened to commit suicide while living in the \n6  therapeutic group home.  In January 2015, B.T. was placed in juvenile detention in \n7  Maricopa County following an incident in a prior group home.   \n8  69. Now 14 years old, B.T. has spent half his life in Arizona foster care custody and \n9  does not expect to find a permanent family.   \n10  A.T. \n11  70. As of February 3, 2015, A.T. is a ten-year-old boy in state foster care living in a \n12  non-therapeutic group home, with a permanency goal of adoption.  He was taken into state \n13  foster care custody most recently in September 2011 with his nine-year-old brother.  \n14  During his time in state foster care, A.T.  has been placed in institutional care; deprived of \n15  necessary physical, dental and mental health care services; separated from his brother and \n16  deprived of sibling visitation; and, has been subject to missed visits by his state child \n17  welfare caseworker.  As a result of these experiences, A.T. has been subjected to emotional \n18  harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n19  71. A.T. and his younger brother were taken into state foster care custody after their \n20  father committed suicide in mid-2011.  This was their second time in state foster care.  \n21  They had also been in state foster care custody prior to 2007.  Their motherโs parental \n22  rights were terminated in January 2007. \n23  72. Following their fatherโs suicide, the state child welfare agency placed A.T. and \n24  his brother in an unlicensed kinship home with an uncle, his wife and their young son.  In \n25  November 2011, A.T.โs  brother was removed from the home and placed in a therapeutic \n26  group home.  A.T. remained with his uncleโs family. \n27  73. During the period from November 2012 to March 2013, the state child welfare \n28  agency failed to arrange for sibling visits between A.T. and his brother, and A.T.โs state \n15\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 16 of 53\n1  caseworker failed to make monthly visits, as required under state policy.  In February \n2  2013, the state child welfare agency was ordered to ensure that the boys had visitation with \n3  each other twice weekly.  The state child welfare agency was also ordered to transfer \n4  A.T.โs  case to the adoption unit to begin the process of finding a permanent family.  As \n5  alleged below, the state child welfare agency failed to comply with that order.  \n6  74. As of March 2013, A.T. had not had a routine physical or seen a dentist in a \n7  year.   \n8  75. At a status hearing in April 2013, the juvenile court made a finding of โno \n9  reasonable effortsโ against the state child welfare agency for its failure to arrange for \n10  sibling visitation, to help A.T. progress with his schooling, and to transfer A.T.โs  case to \n11  the adoption unit.  Despite this ruling, and despite the fact that A.T. had been free for \n12  adoption since he re-entered care in 2011, the state child welfare agency still failed to \n13  transfer A.T.โs  case to the adoption unit 13 months later, in May 2014. \n14  76. In November 2013, a mental health evaluation was scheduled for A.T. and his \n15  brother.  The appointment could not proceed because the state child welfare agency and \n16  DHS failed to arrange transportation for the boys.  As a result, the evaluation had to be re-\n17  scheduled for the following month.  \n18  77. The evaluation was not completed until February 2014.  The evaluator \n19  concluded that more information was needed with regard to A.T.โs  response to his fatherโs \n20  suicide before any therapeutic services could be recommended.  Nonetheless, the state \n21  child welfare agency and DHS failed to request any further assessments. \n22  78. In February 2014, A.T. also reported that his aunt and uncle left him for two to \n23  three hours at a time to care for his five-year-old cousin while they delivered newspapers \n24  in the early mornings.  Around the same time, A.T.โs  uncle posted a video on YouTube  of \n25  himself tasering a 15-year-old child living in the house while another child is heard crying \n26  in the background.   A.T.โs  aunt and uncle were also using corporal punishment to \n27  discipline A.T.  While these facts were known to the state child welfare agency, it never \n28  investigated them. \n16\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 17 of 53\n1  79. That same month, A.T.โs  uncle and aunt announced that they were leaving the \n2  state and would not be taking A.T. with them.  A.T. was thereupon removed from the \n3  uncleโs home and placed in the same foster/adoptive home as his brother, but no services \n4  were put in place for the first three weeks to help A.T. with the transition.  Shortly after \n5  being placed in the foster/adoptive home, A.T. started saying he wanted to die.  \n6  80. The state child welfare agency subsequently moved A.T. to an emergency \n7  respite foster home.  His brotherโs foster family told the state child welfare agency it was \n8  willing to have A.T. return to live with them, but not until A.T. received the behavioral \n9  health services he needed.  Nevertheless, in April 2014, the state child welfare agency \n10  moved A.T. to a non-therapeutic group home out of his home county and 1ยฝ hours away \n11  from his brother.  The state child welfare agency did not arrange visits between the two \n12  boys.  \n13  81. In May 2014, the juvenile court directed the state child welfare agency to \n14  immediately place A.T. back in his home county.  As A.T. was receiving no therapy or \n15  counseling at the time, the court also ordered the state child welfare agency to obtain \n16  therapy for A.T. immediately, beginning no later than the end of the month.  However, in \n17  July 2014, DCS and DHS again failed to coordinate A.T.โs  transportation and A.T. was \n18  unable to go to his scheduled psychological evaluation.   \n19  82. Despite the May 2014 court order, A.T. remained in a non-therapeutic group \n20  home two hours away from his home community for five months.  During that time he had \n21  to travel nearly two hours each way to obtain needed mental health services.  DCS moved \n22  A.T. to a non-therapeutic group home in his home county in September 2014. \n23  The C-B Siblings \n24  83. The C-B siblings include two brothers, A.C-B and M.C-B, and two sisters, J.C-\n25  B and D.C-B, all of whom were taken into state foster care custody in January 2014.  As of \n26  February 3, 2015, A.C-B is six years old, M.C-B is eight years old, J.C-B is three years old \n27  and D.C-B is seven years old. Also as of that date, their permanency goal is reunification. \n28  During their time in state foster care, they have been unnecessarily separated, deprived of \n17\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 18 of 53\n1  needed mental health care and parental visitation, and the sisters were placed in an \n2  inappropriate institutional setting.  As a result of these experiences, they have been \n3  subjected to emotional harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n4  84. Because of the traumatizing circumstances that led to their being taken into \n5  foster care, the siblingsโ lawyer requested at the first juvenile court hearing of the case in \n6  January 2014 that DHS immediately provide the children with trauma therapy.  As alleged \n7  further below, the state child welfare agency and DHS delayed those services for nine \n8  months.      \n9  85. The state child welfare agency initially placed the four siblings with a relative \n10  2ยฝ hours away from the home from which they were removed.  Because of this distant \n11  placement, their urgent response assessments, required for every child taken into foster \n12  care, were delayed, and the children never received any behavioral health services while in \n13  this placement.  \n14  86. In March 2014, the state child welfare agency removed the children from the \n15  relative and placed them in separate locations.  The state child welfare agency placed \n16  eight-year-old M.C-B and five-year-old A.C-B in a licensed family foster home.  Six-year-\n17  old D.C-B and two-year-old J.C-B were placed in a non-therapeutic group home.  None of \n18  the siblings received behavioral health services while in these placements. \n19  87. That same month, M.C-B and A.C-Bโs foster parents requested that M.C-B \n20  receive a psychological evaluation.  The evaluation was not conducted for eight months.   \n21  88. In April 2014, the state child welfare agency moved all four of the C-B siblings \n22  to their fatherโs home.  The childrenโs state child welfare case manager never visited them \n23  in the home. The state child welfare agency and DHS also failed to ensure that any of the \n24  children received behavioral health services or counseling, even though D.C-B and A.C-B \n25  were exhibiting sexualized behaviors indicative of possible sexual abuse.  Only two weeks \n26  after being placed there, the childrenโs father requested that the state child welfare agency \n27  remove them. \n28 \n18\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 19 of 53\n1  89. In May 2014, the state child welfare agency again split up the siblings, this time \n2  into three different foster homes.  M.C-B and A.C-B were placed in the same foster home \n3  where they had previously been placed.  The state child welfare agency placed each of the \n4  girls, D.C-B and J.C-B, in separate foster homes.    \n5  90. From the time they were taken into custody to May 2014, none of the siblings \n6  had any visits with their biological mother.   \n7  91. Following a juvenile court hearing in early June 2014, DCS agreed to ensure \n8  that all four children receive therapy โ not just an intake or enrollment โ with a trauma \n9  therapist by June 20.  DCS also agreed to pay for the services if DHS would not pay.  In \n10  addition, the court directed DCS to provide the children with relational therapy with both \n11  parents.  DCS further agreed to work with the childrenโs father to help meet his \n12  transportation needs in order to facilitate visitation with the children, including providing \n13  him with a gas card.  DCS failed to provide any of these services or supports.    \n14  92. Consequently, on July 2, 2014, the juvenile court made a โno reasonable \n15  effortsโ finding with regard to DCSโs failure to provide services for the siblings.  The court \n16  called the agencyโs conduct โappalling.โ   \n17  93. In late July 2014, D.C-B was placed in the same foster home as M.C-B and \n18  A.C-B.  As of February 3, 2015, J.C-B remains in a separate foster home. \n19  94. In August 2014, eight months after being brought into foster care, the three \n20  eldest siblings finally had their behavioral health evaluations completed.   \n21  95. In mid-September 2014, nine months after being taken into foster care, M.C-B \n22  and A.C-B had received only one therapy session.  Though their CFT recommended that \n23  they receive weekly therapy sessions, the facility where the therapist is located can only \n24  accommodate therapy sessions every other week.   \n25  96. By September 2014, D.C-B had received only two sessions with a therapist.  \n26  J.C-B had an intake meeting with her therapist, but her therapy sessions had not yet started.  \n27 \n28 \n19\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 20 of 53\n1  97. In December 2014, DHS had only just begun the psychological evaluation that \n2  M.C-Bโs foster parents first requested in March 2014.  In addition, M.C-B and A.C-B are \n3  both struggling in school with attention problems. \n4  J.M.  \n5  98. As of February 3, 2015, J.M. is a nine-year-old boy with a permanency goal of \n6  adoption.  He was taken into state foster care when he was six years old.  During his time \n7  in state foster care custody, J.M. has been deprived of needed mental health care, placed in \n8  institutions on numerous occasions, and has had his education repeatedly disrupted.  As a \n9  result of these experiences, J.M. has been subjected to emotional harm and/or an ongoing \n10  unreasonable risk of harm. \n11  99. J.M. was brought into state foster care in May 2012.  The state child welfare \n12  agency initially placed him in a shelter for five days, then moved him to live with his \n13  grandmother.  When she could not care for him, the state child welfare agency moved J.M. \n14  to a group home in a different county.  J.M. remained there for two months. \n15  100. In July 2012, the state child welfare agency moved J.M. to an unlicensed \n16  kinship home back in his home community.  J.M. entered first grade that summer.  The \n17  state child welfare agency failed to ensure that J.M. had transportation to and from school.  \n18  As a consequence, J.M. missed sixty days of schooling. \n19  101. In September 2013, J.M. was moved to another kinship placement two hours \n20  from his home county.  As a result of this placement change, J.M. had to start second grade \n21  at a new school.  The move also resulted in a change in J.M.โs mental health providers, \n22  disrupting his mental health care.  \n23  102. In October 2013, the state child welfare agency moved J.M. to a licensed \n24  family foster home back in his home county, resulting in yet another school change for \n25  J.M.  \n26  103. In February 2014, the state child welfare agency moved J.M. to a non-\n27  therapeutic group home in another county two hours away.  As a result, he had to enroll at \n28  his fourth school in less than two years since being brought into state foster care.  His \n20\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 21 of 53\n1  teachers began developing an Individualized  Education Program (โIEPโ) for him, but it \n2  was not finalized or implemented.  He was also diagnosed with ADHD.   \n3  104. Between February and June 2014, J.M. had to move among four different \n4  group homes, all two hours from his home community.  During this period, DHS took the \n5  position that J.M. could not be placed in an HCTC therapeutic foster home until he had \n6  first received, and exhausted, out-patient counseling.  But each time J.M. was forced to \n7  move to a different group home, he had to start his therapy over again with a new therapist.  \n8  105. J.M.โs visitation with his mother was also disrupted when he was moved \n9  among these various group homes.  J.M. has no siblings and his mother is his only intimate \n10  family relationship.  She had trouble traveling the two hours by bus to see J.M. at his group \n11  homes and the state child welfare agency refused to coordinate alternative transportation \n12  for her.  Instead, the state child welfare agency required eight-year-old J.M. to travel three \n13  hours each way in a transport van for a two-hour visit with his mother.   \n14  106. In June 2014, DCS removed J.M. from his most recent group home and \n15  returned him to a shelter.  This placement resulted in another disruption in his education \n16  and mental health treatment.  With each educational disruption, J.M.โs new school has had \n17  to re-start the IEP process of assessment and planning.  DCS has failed to ensure that his \n18  IEP was completed or provided to his new school, which had to be ordered by the juvenile \n19  court.   \n20  107. Later in June 2014, the state child welfare agency and DHS finally approved \n21  J.M. for an HCTC placement after counseling proved inadequate.  However, at that time, \n22  there were no HCTC placements available and J.M. continued to live at the shelter for four \n23  months.  In late October, DCS moved him to a licensed non-therapeutic foster home.  It \n24  was not until November 2014 that his current school concluded the necessary evaluations \n25  and finalized his IEP.  \n26  J.C. \n27  108. As of February 3, 2015, J.C. is a ten-year-old boy with a permanency goal of \n28  adoption.  He was taken into state foster care when he was eight.  During the 2ยฝ years he \n21\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 22 of 53\n1  has been in Arizona foster care, J.C. has suffered delays in needed health care treatment \n2  after being diagnosed with PTSD; he has been placed in inappropriate institutional \n3  settings; and he has been shuffled through numerous schools.  He was also physically \n4  abused while in state foster care custody.  As a result of these experiences, J.C. has been \n5  subjected to emotional and physical harm and/or an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm. \n6  109. J.C. was brought into state foster care custody in March 2012.  He displayed \n7  behaviors that suggested he had been sexually abused, and was placed in an HCTC home.  \n8  However, in September 2012, he was moved from that home and placed in a non-\n9  therapeutic group home.  Not surprisingly, his mental health immediately deteriorated.  \n10  Among other things, he soiled his pants and banged his head against the wall.  Despite this, \n11  the state child welfare agency kept J.C. in the group home for seven months. \n12  110. The state child welfare agency moved J.C. back with his father in March 2013, \n13  while retaining legal custody over J.C.  J.C.โs father did not take J.C. to his therapy \n14  sessions.  Nonetheless, the state child welfare agency left J.C. with his father and failed to \n15  ensure that J.C. received the care he needed.   \n16  111. Two months later, nine-year-old J.C. attempted suicide by taking an overdose \n17  of his psychotropic medication.  He was transported to the emergency room and admitted \n18  to a psychiatric hospital for ten days.  The state child welfare agency then returned him to \n19  his fatherโs home, still retaining legal custody over J.C.   \n20  112. In March 2014, J.C. disclosed that his father had been physically abusing him \n21  by hitting him with a belt.  The state child welfare agency then removed J.C. from his \n22  fatherโs home.  The abuse was so severe that the police criminally investigated J.C.โs \n23  beating.  \n24  113. After removing him from his father, the state child welfare agency placed J.C. \n25  in a non-therapeutic group home.  As a result of this placement change, J.C. had to change \n26  schools and has had significant problems adjusting.  In July, DCS moved J.C. again, this \n27  time to a therapeutic group home in another county, resulting in another school disruption.  \n28 \n22\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 23 of 53\n1  In August 2014, DCS moved J.C. to an HCTC foster home.  As of February 3, 2015, he is \n2  still living there. \n3  B.  The Next Friends \n4  114. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Jefferson Street, MD 4100, Phoenix, Arizona \n2  85034.  AHCCCS  is charged with administering and supervising Arizonaโs Medicaid \n3  program.  \n4 \nFIRST CAUSE  OF ACTION  โ VIOLATION  OF PLAINTIFFSโ  SUBSTANTIVE \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n5 \n6  120. Paragraphs 1-119 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n7  121. This claim is asserted against defendants McKay and Christ in their official \n8  capacities on behalf of a class of children who are or will be in the legal custody of the \n9  Arizona Department of Child Safety due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect (the \n10  โGeneral Classโ). \n11  122. DCS provides and is legally obligated to provide members of the General \n12  Class with physical and dental health care services through the state Comprehensive \n13  Medical and Dental Program (โCMDPโ).   DCS administers the CMDP. \n14  123. DHS provides and is legally obligated to provide members of the General \n15  Class with mental and behavioral health services through ADHS Behavioral Health \n16  Services (โBHSโ).   BHS delivers these services through contracts with Regional \n17  Behavioral Health Authorities (โRBHAsโ)  across the state. \n18  124. DCS is also responsible for monitoring the physical, behavioral and emotional \n19  health status and needs of all members of the General Class and coordinating the physical, \n20  behavioral and mental health services provided to those children to ensure that they receive \n21  the health care services they need while in state foster care.  \n22  125. Many children in state foster care need such services to help them cope with \n23  the significant trauma to which they were exposed before being removed from their homes. \n24  For example, according to the Arizona Office of the Auditor General, โas of September \n25  2013, approximately 31 percent of the children in out-of-home care aged 13 or older were \n26  clinically diagnosed as emotionally disturbed.โ \n27  126. DCS and DHS are failing to fulfill their obligations to provide, coordinate and \n28  monitor medical, dental, mental and behavioral health services to members of the General \n24\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 25 of 53\n1  Class.  As a result, members of the General Class are being harmed and subjected to an \n2  unreasonable risk of harm and deterioration while in DCS state foster care custody. \n3  127. In both its 2011 and 2012 annual reports, Arizonaโs state-wide Citizen Review \n4  Panel (โCRPโ) found that many children in state foster care were not receiving adequate \n5  mental and behavioral health assessments and services.  The CRP โrepeatedly observed \n6  untreated mental health problemsโ among children in state foster care.  It also found that a \n7  โlack of access to comprehensive and timely mental health assessments and services \n8  exacerbated the problems of the childrenโ and resulted in, among other things, โmultiple \n9  disrupted foster and adoptive placements, delays in children obtaining permanency, and \n10  CPS involvement in the next generation of children.โ \n11  128. Moreover, according to the CRPโs 2012 report, โ[w]hen  services were \n12  provided, they were observed to be brief and limited with cases being closed without \n13  observation of sustained behavior changes and few aftercare services in place.  When \n14  children were removed, delays between the time of referral and assessment were observed \n15  to cause even longer delays before intervention was provided.โ  \n16  129. Similarly, in its 2013 Report, the CRP found that โthe continuum of services . . \n17  . for families is limited.โ  According to the report, โcomprehensive services were lacking \n18  and existing services are unable to maintain long term change in these families.โ   \n19  130. The CRP is not alone in noting unacceptable shortages and delays in the \n20  provision of needed services.  According to a 2012 report issued by DESโs own consultant, \n21  โ[a]s much as half of the time a child spends in [foster care] is spent waiting on services.โ  \n22  More recently, the Office of the Auditor Generalโs report on DCS policy and practice \n23  recognized the โ[i]nadequate  access to behavioral health servicesโ for youth in foster care. \n24  131. The Arizona Chapter of the Foster Family-Based Treatment Association \n25  (โFFTAโ)  has also noted the severe shortage of mental health services delivered by \n26  professional foster homes (also known as โtherapeutic foster homesโ) to children in state \n27  foster care.  These services, referred to in Arizona as โHome Care Training to Home Care \n28  Client Servicesโ (โHCTCโ),  are supposed to be available to children in state foster care \n25\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 26 of 53\n1  who need therapeutic family-based intervention.  These therapeutic foster homes are \n2  administered by DHS through RBHAs.  DCS pays room and board for children in state \n3  foster care placed in HCTC homes.  \n4  132. There are currently only about 400 HCTC homes for more than 16,500 \n5  children in state foster care.  Moreover, most of these homes are only licensed for 1 or 2 \n6  placements, severely limiting the number of children for whom these homes are available.  \n7  The severe shortage of HCTC homes places members of the General Class at an \n8  unreasonable risk of deteriorating while in state foster care.  \n9  133. The shortage of HCTC providers, coupled with the short-term nature of HCTC \n10  services (DHS has a practice of requiring such services to be re-authorized every 90 days), \n11  also subjects children in state foster care to emotionally harmful placement instability, as \n12  children are moved out of HCTC homes far too soon after being placed there.  The CRPโs \n13  2013 Report specifically found that the HCTC placement structure โcauses disruption \n14  when a specialized placement is required to meet a childโs needs.โ  This placement \n15  disruption causes children with higher needs to โyo-yoโ up and down in terms of their \n16  behaviors, thereby driving additional placement moves, which results in even further \n17  unnecessary re-traumatization.   \n18  134. The Arizona Auditor General has also recognized the state child welfare \n19  agencyโs and DHSโs practice of failing to provide โlong-term solutions for children in need \n20  of continued supportโ for their mental health needs.  According to the Auditor Generalโs \n21  Report, โ[c]hildren whose behavioral health improves in therapeutic foster homes may be \n22  moved to less restrictive family settings, but without the same continued support, their \n23  behaviors may worsen, resulting in placement disruptions and subsequent placement in \n24  congregate care.โ  \n25  135. DCS and DHS further abdicate their legal duty to provide care for members of \n26  the General Class by leaving the decision whether children should be placed in HCTC \n27  homes to the six RBHAs that operate throughout the state, rather than allowing that \n28  decision to be made by the childrenโs Child and Family Teams (โCFTsโ).   Making matters \n26\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 27 of 53\n1  worse, the RBHAs have different processes for determining whether HCTC should be \n2  provided to the children in their geographic regions.  As a result, the availability  of HCTC \n3  turns in part on the fortuitous circumstance of where the member of the General Class \n4  happens to live at the time HCTC is requested.   \n5  136. DCS caseworkers also fail to meet their obligation under agency policy to \n6  participate in CFT meetings, including inter-agency meetings with DHS, that are a \n7  prerequisite to members of the General Class receiving behavioral health services.  When \n8  DCS caseworkers do not join CFT meetings, essential information about a childโs needs is \n9  not shared, treatment planning and referrals are held up, and services are delayed.  These \n10  deficiencies expose members of the General Class to an undue risk that they will not \n11  receive the behavioral services they require, leading to a deterioration of the childโs \n12  condition while in state foster care custody. \n13  137. Remarkably, even former DES Director Carter acknowledged at an \n14  October 17, 2013 meeting of the CPS Oversight Committee that DES does not collect data \n15  in a way that enables the child welfare agency to show that a particular set of family \n16  interventions is effective.  At the same meeting, Ms. Sotomayor, then Assistant Director \n17  for the former DES Division of Children, Youth and Families, agreed that it is unclear \n18  whether a number of services provided by DES โare appropriate or adequateโ for families. \n19  138. In addition to the lack of adequate mental health services, far too many \n20  children in state foster care fail to receive needed physical health care services.  According \n21  to the stateโs Practice Improvement Case Review (โPICRโ) for 2013, DCS failed to \n22  properly assess and address the childrenโs physical health needs in a third (34%) of the \n23  cases reviewed.  The same review found that 22% of children who had been in foster care \n24  for more than 12 months had not received a comprehensive physical health examination.  \n25  In addition, more than 40% of children who had been in care for less than a year did not \n26  receive an examination within 30 days as required by agency policy.  Based on the same \n27  2013 PICR, DCS had failed to assess and provide necessary services to address the \n28  childrenโs mental health needs in nearly one in five cases reviewed. \n27\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 28 of 53\n1  139. Based on the 2012 PICR, the state child welfare agency failed to meet the \n2  physical health care needs of children in state foster care in 49% of the cases reviewed.  \n3  140. Moreover, according to the state child welfare agencyโs own data, during \n4  federal fiscal year 2012, 36% of children in state foster care ages three to six did not \n5  receive well-care visits required under the periodicity schedule that the state is required to \n6  establish under the EPSDT provisions of the federal Medicaid Act.  A nearly identical \n7  percentage of adolescents in foster care likewise failed to receive such required health care \n8  visits.  Similar failures in providing such services to these age groups were reported for \n9  federal fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011.  \n10  141. In addition, according to the stateโs PICR for 2013, 34% of children who had \n11  been in state foster care for more than six months were found not to have had a dental \n12  examination within the most recent six months.  During 2012, the number of children who \n13  had missed required dentist visits was nearly four in ten. \n14  142. The inadequacy  of the health care services provided to the General Class \n15  subjects these children to harm and/or an unreasonable risk of suffering ongoing physical \n16  and emotional harm and deterioration while in state foster care. \n17  143. A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n18  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n19  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n20  144. Defendant McKay directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n21  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n22  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, \n23  from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial \n24  factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the General Classโs \n25  constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n26  145. Defendant Christ directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n27  policies and practices regarding the provision of mental and behavioral health services by \n28  DHS.  The foregoing DHS policies and practices fail to satisfy its affirmative duty to \n28\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 29 of 53\n1  protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, from an unreasonable risk of \n2  emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, \n3  the ongoing violation of the General Classโs constitutionally protected liberty and privacy \n4  rights. \n5  146. The foregoing policies and practices of DCS and DHS described herein \n6  constitute a policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside \n7  the exercise of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the \n8  constitutionally protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs \n9  and other members of the General Class.  As a result, all members of the General Class \n10  have been harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm, in \n11  deprivation of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n12  Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n13  147. These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  the right \n14  of members of the General Class to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of harm \n15  while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n16  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the General Class; the right to \n17  necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the General Class from \n18  deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise while in state foster \n19  care; and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring of the General \n20  Classโs safety and well-being.  \n21  148. As of September 30, 2014, there were 16,990 members of the General Class.  \n22  The General Class is sufficiently numerous to make individual  joinder impracticable. \n23  149. Named Plaintiffsโ First Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n24  are common to, and typical of, all members of the General Class.  Such common questions \n25  of fact include:  \n26  a.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n27  General Class with legally required medical and dental services necessary to keep \n28 \n29\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 30 of 53\n1  the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent them from \n2  deteriorating physically while in state foster care custody;  \n3  b.  Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n4  General Class with legally required mental and behavioral health services necessary \n5  to keep the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent them from \n6  deteriorating emotionally and psychologically while in state foster care custody; and  \n7  c.   Whether DCS has a practice of failing to coordinate and ensure that \n8  the General Class are provided with the legally required mental and behavioral \n9  health services to keep the General Class safe and properly cared for, and to prevent \n10  them from deteriorating emotionally and psychologically while in state foster care \n11  custody. \n12  150. Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs and DHSโs actions and \n13  inactions violate the General Classโs substantive due process rights to be free from harm \n14  and an unreasonable risk of harm while in state foster care custody. \n15  151. Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the General \n16  Class they seek to represent.  \n17  152. Named Plaintiffs and the putative General Class are represented by: \n18  a.    Attorneys employed by Perkins Coie LLP, an international law firm \n19  with an office in Phoenix, Arizona, whose attorneys have extensive experience in \n20  complex civil and public interest litigation, including class action litigation; \n21  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n22  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n23  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n24  action litigation; and \n25  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n26  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n27  welfare class actions nationally.  \n28 \n30\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 31 of 53\n1  153. The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n2  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the General Class. \n3  154. Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n4  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n5  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n6  155. Defendants McKay and Christ have acted or failed to act on grounds generally \n7  applicable to the General Class, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffsโ \n8  counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the General Class. \n9 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  โ VIOLATION  OF PLAINTIFFSโ  RIGHTS \nUNDER THE EPSDT PROVISIONS  OF THE MEDICAID  ACT  \n10 \n11  156. Paragraphs 1-155 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n12  157. This claim is asserted against defendants McKay, Christ and Betlach in their \n13  official capacities on behalf of all members of the General Class who are eligible for \n14  Medicaid (the โMedicaid Subclassโ).  \n15  158. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program under Title XIX of the Social \n16  Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396, et seq., designed to provide medically necessary physical \n17  and mental health care to, among others, eligible children. \n18  159. States that choose to participate in the Medicaid program are reimbursed by \n19  the federal government for a portion of the cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  To \n20  receive federal funds, states must comply with the requirements set forth in Title XIX of \n21  the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations.  Among those requirements, \n22  states are required to develop state plans that identify the medical services available to \n23  eligible beneficiaries. \n24  160. Children in state foster care are eligible beneficiaries of Medicaid services \n25  under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I). \n26  161. Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(a)(4)(B), states are \n27  required to provide EPSDT services to eligible children in state foster care.  The required \n28  screening services are set forth in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1), while ยงยง 1396a(a)(43)(C) and \n31\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 32 of 53\n1  1396d(r)(5) require states to provide necessary health care, diagnostic services and treatment \n2  to correct or ameliorate defects or physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered \n3  by those screening services.   \n4  162. Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1)(A)(i) and 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.58, states are \n5  required to establish periodicity schedules setting forth when the screening services \n6  required under the Medicaid Act must be provided.     \n7  163. Moreover, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. ยง 435.930(a), states \n8  must provide EPSDT services with reasonable promptness. \n9  164. The policy underlying the EPSDT mandate is to prevent illness, as well as to \n10  ensure that health problems are comprehensively diagnosed and then treated as soon as \n11  they are detected, before they become more complex and their treatment more costly. \n12  165. Pursuant to a contract with AHCCCS,  DCS serves as the statewide \n13  administrator responsible for the provision of physical, dental, vision and hearing health \n14  care services, including screening, diagnostic and treatment services, to members of the \n15  Medicaid Subclass.   DCS and AHCCCS  are legally obligated to ensure that members of \n16  the Medicaid Subclass receive such medical services.  DCS provides such medical services \n17  through CMDP.  \n18  166. DCS also determines the Medicaid eligibility of every child in state foster care \n19  custody.  \n20  167. Pursuant to a contract with AHCCCS,  DHS serves as the statewide \n21  administrator responsible for the provision of mental and behavioral health care services, \n22  including screening, diagnostic and treatment services, to members of the Medicaid \n23  Subclass.  DHS and AHCCCS  are legally obligated to ensure that members of the \n24  Medicaid Subclass receive such medical services.  DHS provides such services through \n25  BHS, which, in turn, delivers these services through contracts with RBHAs across the \n26  state. \n27  168. Under Arizonaโs EPSDT Periodicity Schedule, DCS is required to provide \n28  annual physical examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass who are age three and \n32\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 33 of 53\n1  older, and more frequent physical examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass \n2  under age three.  The stateโs Periodicity Schedule further requires DCS to provide annual \n3  vision screenings to members of the Medicaid Subclass ages 4-6, 8, 10 and 12 years old, \n4  and semi-annual dental examinations to members of the Medicaid Subclass who are six \n5  months of age or older. \n6  169. DCSโs Policy and Procedure Manual further provides that it is the \n7  responsibility of the DCS foster care caseworker to ensure that a child entering foster care \n8  be given a complete medical examination that meets EPSDT requirements within 30 days \n9  after initial placement in out-of-home care. \n10  170. As for mental and behavioral health services, DHS is required under Arizonaโs \n11  EPSDT Periodicity Schedule to provide members of the Medicaid Subclass age three and \n12  older with annual psychosocial/behavioral assessments.  For members of the Medicaid \n13  Subclass under the age of three, the Periodicity Schedule requires DHS to provide more \n14  frequent psychosocial/behavioral  assessments. \n15  171. Under DHS Policy, DHS is also responsible for conducting an Urgent \n16  Response assessment of every child within 24 hours of removal from his or her home to \n17  detect both initial and delayed effects of trauma.   \n18  172.  AHCCCS  is charged under state statutes and the federal Medicaid Act with \n19  the responsibility to administer and supervise Arizonaโs Medicaid program. \n20  Notwithstanding  its contracts with DCS and DHS, AHCCCS has the authority and \n21  responsibility to determine the stateโs Medicaid eligibility policies and criteria, its service \n22  coverage and its payment policies. AHCCCS  is also responsible for ensuring the stateโs \n23  compliance with federal Medicaid requirements, including the provision of EPSDT \n24  services, and for supervising the compliance of DCS and DHS under their contacts with \n25  AHCCCS.   \n26  173. Defendants McKay, Christ and Betlach have a practice of failing to provide \n27  members of the Medicaid Subclass with the screening, diagnostic and treatment services \n28 \n33\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 34 of 53\n1  required under the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยงยง \n2  1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and 1396d(r). \n3  174. Defendants McKay, Christ and Betlach also have a practice of failing to provide \n4  such services with reasonable promptness, in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8) and 42 \n5  C.F.R. ยง 435.930(a). \n6  175. The foregoing policies and practices of defendant McKay, who directly and \n7  indirectly controls and is responsible for the policies and practices of DCS, defendant \n8  Christ, who directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the policies and practices \n9  of DHS, and defendant Betlach, who is responsible for supervising the compliance of DCS \n10  and DHS under their contracts with AHCCCS  and ensuring their compliance with federal \n11  law, violate the rights of Named Plaintiffs and the Medicaid Subclass under the Medicaid \n12  Act.  \n13  176. As of September 30, 2014, there were over 10,000 members of the Medicaid \n14  Subclass.  The Medicaid Subclass is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder \n15  impracticable.  \n16  177. Named Plaintiffsโ Second Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n17  are common to, and typical of, all members of the Medicaid Subclass.  Such common \n18  questions of fact include:  \n19  a.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n20  Medicaid Subclass with screening services that comply with the stateโs Periodicity \n21  Schedule;    \n22  b.  Whether DCS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n23  Medicaid Subclass with medically necessary diagnostic and treatment services;    \n24  c.   Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n25  Medicaid Class with screening services that comply with the stateโs Periodicity \n26  Schedule; and  \n27  d.  Whether DHS has a practice of failing to provide members of the \n28  Medicaid Subclass with medically necessary diagnostic and treatment services. \n34\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 35 of 53\n1  178. Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs, DHSโs and \n2  AHCCCSโs  actions and inactions violate the Medicaid Subclassโs rights under the EPSDT \n3  provisions of the federal Medicaid Act. \n4  179. Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n5  Medicaid Subclass they seek to represent. \n6  180. Named Plaintiffs and the putative Medicaid Subclass are represented by: \n7  a.

Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n15  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n16  welfare class actions nationally.  \n17  181. The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n18  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Medicaid Subclass. \n19  182.

Defendants McKay, Christ and Betlach have acted or failed to act on grounds \n23  generally applicable to the Medicaid Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive \n24  relief.  According to Director Betlachโs May 17, 2015 motion to intervene in this action, it \n25  is not possible to enter the relief sought in this Cause of Action without AHCCCS  as a \n26  defendant. Plaintiffsโ counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the \n27  Medicaid Subclass. \n28 \n35\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 36 of 53\n1  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION  โ VIOLATION  OF PLAINTIFFSโ  SUBSTANTIVE \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n2 \n184. Paragraphs 1-183 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n3 \n185. This claim is asserted on behalf of the General Class against defendant McKay \n4 \nin his official capacity. \n5 \n6  Members of the General Class Are Not Receiving Timely Investigations of \nReports That They Have Been Maltreated in State Foster Care Custody. \n7 \n186. In late 2013, it was publicly disclosed for the first time that the state child \n8 \nwelfare agency had failed to investigate 6,600 reports of alleged child abuse and neglect \n9 \nbetween 2009 and 2013, choosing instead to simply set those reports aside.  In July 2014, \n10 \nit was disclosed that in another 14,000 cases, no documentation had been entered in the \n11 \nchildโs or familyโs case file for 60 days or more through April 2014.  \n12 \n187. While the legislation passed on May 29, 2014 attempts to address those \n13 \nenormous backlogs, DCSโs failure to complete child maltreatment investigations in a \n14 \ntimely manner is not limited to those 20,600 reports and cases.  In fact, DCS is also failing \n15 \nto initiate and complete investigations in a timely manner of reports that children have \n16 \nbeen abused or neglected while in state foster care.  DESโs own consultants acknowledged \n17 \nin 2012 that foster care workers โoften have a backlogโ of new maltreatment reports \n18 \ninvolving  children in state foster custody. \n19 \n188. According to the state child welfare agencyโs own data, during federal fiscal \n20 \nyear 2012, the state child welfare agency failed to initiate investigations into 36% of all \n21 \nreports that children in state foster care custody had been abused or neglected, within the \n22 \ntime frames required under state policy. During the six-month period from October 1, 2012 \n23 \nthrough March 31, 2013, 54% of all investigations involving  children in state foster care \n24 \nwere initiated late.  \n25 \n189. State law and agency policy further requires that the outcomes of child \n26 \nmaltreatment investigations be entered into the Stateโs child welfare information database \n27 \nwithin 45 days and that investigations be closed within 60 days.  However, according to \n28 \n36\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 37 of 53\n1  state data, during the six-month period from October 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013, the state \n2  child welfare agency failed to meet this 60-day deadline in the large majority of \n3  investigations involving children already in state foster care, regardless of the level of risk \n4  to which members of the General Class were exposed.  In fact, 72% of investigations into \n5  high risk reports involving  a present danger to children in state foster care were still not \n6  closed after 60 days; 73% of investigations into reports involving  an impending danger to \n7  children in care were not closed in a timely manner; 72% of investigations into reports that \n8  children in care had been abused or neglected within the past 30 days were not closed \n9  within the required period; and 78% of investigations were not closed within the required \n10  timeframe where the reports involved children in state foster care who had been abused or \n11  neglected more than 30 days prior, the date of the last occurrence of abuse or neglect was \n12  unknown,  or the child was exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm.   \n13  190. These widespread delays in initiating and completing investigations into \n14  reported child abuse and neglect subject members of the General Class to an unreasonable \n15  risk of physical and emotional harm while in state foster care. \n16  191. A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n17  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n18  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n19  192. Defendant McKay directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n20  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n21  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the General Class, including the Named Plaintiffs, \n22  from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a substantial \n23  factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the General Classโs \n24  constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n25  193. The foregoing policies and practices of DCS described herein constitute a \n26  policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside the exercise \n27  of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally \n28  protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs and other \n37\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 38 of 53\n1  members of the General Class.  As a result, all members of the General Class have been \n2  harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of harm, in deprivation of \n3  their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n4  United States Constitution. \n5  194. These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right of \n6  members of the General Class to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of harm \n7  while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n8  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the General Class; the right to \n9  necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the General Class from \n10  deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise while in state foster \n11  care; and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring of the General \n12  Classโs safety and well-being. \n13  195. As of September 30, 2014, there were 16,990 members of the General Class. \n14  The General Class is sufficiently numerous to make individual  joinder impracticable. \n15  196. Named Plaintiffsโ Third Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n16  are common to, and typical of, all members of the General Class.  Such common questions \n17  of fact include whether DCS has a practice of failing to conduct timely investigations into \n18  reports that members of the General Class have been abused or neglected while in state \n19  foster care custody. \n20  197. Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n21  violate the General Classโs substantive due process rights to be free from harm and an \n22  unreasonable risk of harm while in state foster care custody. \n23  198. Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the General \n24  Class they seek to represent.  \n25  199. Named Plaintiffs and the putative General Class are represented by: \n26  a.    Attorneys employed by Perkins Coie LLP, an international law firm \n27  with an office in Phoenix, Arizona, whose attorneys have extensive experience in \n28  complex civil and public interest litigation, including class action litigation; \n38\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 39 of 53\n1  b.

Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n6  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n7  welfare class actions nationally.  \n8  200. The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n9  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the General Class. \n10  201. Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n11  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n12  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n13  202. Defendant McKay has acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to \n14  the General Class, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffsโ counsel know \n15  of no conflicts between or among members of the General Class. \n16 \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION  โ VIOLATION  OF PLAINTIFFSโ  SUBSTANTIVE \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n17 \n18  203. Paragraphs 1-202 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n19  204. This claim is asserted against Defendant McKay in his official capacity on \n20  behalf of all members of the General Class, except those children who are or will be in a \n21  kinship placement (the โNon-Kinship  Subclassโ). \n22 \nA.  The Non-Kinship Subclass Suffers from a Severe Shortage of Foster \nHomes. \n23 \n24  205. The state child welfare agency has failed to provide members of the Non-\n25  Kinship Subclass with an adequate number and array of foster care placements.  The \n26  severe shortage of foster care placements frequently results in the state child welfare \n27  agency placing members of the Non-Kinship Subclass in the first available bed, rather than \n28  selecting placements based on the childrenโs needs. \n39\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 40 of 53\n1  206. While Arizonaโs population of children in out-of-home care has grown by 56% \n2  from September 2009 to March 2014, the number of Arizona foster families has only \n3  increased by 9%, and the percentage of children placed in licensed foster homes has \n4  decreased by 9%, during the same time period.  \n5  207. As of September 30, 2014, there were 9,418 children in state foster care who \n6  were not placed with relatives or in trial home reunification settings.  Nevertheless, the \n7  state child welfare agency reported that it had licensed only 4,397 foster homes to accept \n8  children in state foster care.  Moreover, these foster homes provided only 5,669 available \n9  spaces that could potentially match the needs of the children in DCSโs custody.  Even \n10  assuming that each of these spaces matched the needs of the Non-Kinship Class, 3,749 \n11  class members would still be without a foster home.  \n12  208. A spokeswoman for DCS acknowledged  in July 2014 that the department \n13  โdesperately needs more foster families to care for the increased number of children in out-\n14  of-home care.โ   \n15  209. A recent DCS report stated that โ[h]omes are needed for children of all ages, \n16  however the most significant shortages of homes are for teens, sibling groups, and children \n17  who have complex medical needs.โ  The agency admits that โ[t]here is a significant need \n18  for additional foster and adoptive homes in all areas of Arizona.โ \n19  210. According to a recent audit by the Arizona Auditor General, the state child \n20  welfare agency โhas not adequately implementedโ performance-based contracting in the \n21  contracts it has entered into with private child placing agencies to recruit foster parents, \n22  identify and arrange child placement options, and supervise and monitor licensed foster \n23  parents.  The audit also found that the state child welfare agency has not developed \n24  policies and procedures for monitoring the performance measures in its contracts, has not \n25  used performance measure data to assess contractor performance, and has not adequately \n26  designed the contracts to incentivize performance. \n27  211. In addition to the inadequate recruiting of new foster homes, a 2012 survey \n28  conducted by Arizona State University noted that programs and financial benefits available \n40\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 41 of 53\n1  to foster families have been drastically cut in recent years due to severe budget constraints.  \n2  For example, in 2009, the state cut foster family reimbursement rates and allowances for \n3  clothing.  \n4  212. The scarcity of foster homes in Arizona is a well-known problem.  In 2012, \n5  The Arizona Republic reported that โ[t]he state is in dire need of families to care for \n6  children removed from their homes because of suspected abuse or neglect.  But families \n7  leave the foster care system faster than new ones come in.  Many who leave say itโs not \n8  necessarily the children who have caused them to turn in their license but their frustration \n9  with the systemโs inability to help them.โ   \n10  213. Former DCS director Charles Flanagan  has also acknowledged to members of \n11  the state legislature that there are many instances when children have slept in agency \n12  offices because the agency did not have a placement for them.  \n13  214. In fact, according to a recent press account, over just a six-day span from \n14  September 28 to October 4, 2014, 36 members of the Non-Kinship Subclass spent at least \n15  one night in DCS office buildings in Maricopa and Pima counties.  Of those 36 children, \n16  10 were between 2 and 5 years old, 11 were between 6 and 12 years old, and 15 were \n17  between 13 and 18 years old. According to Gene Burns, who supervises DCS after-hours \n18  units, โ[i]n the 17 years [he has] been here, the biggest shock to [him] is when [DCS] \n19  bought cribsโ for the young children sleeping at DCSโs offices.  As he acknowledged, \n20  โ[t]his is not the place to put a kid.โ  \n21 \nB.  Because of the Shortage of Foster Homes, Members of the Non-Kinship \nSubclass Are Frequently Placed Far from Their Home Communities. \n22 \n23  215. DCSโs failure to maintain an adequate array of foster homes harms members \n24  of the Non-Kinship Subclass by causing them to be placed, or putting them at an \n25  unreasonable risk of being placed, far from their home communities.  Such placements \n26  disconnect members of the Non-Kinship Subclass from family, friends, and neighbors, and \n27  frequently lead to highly disruptive changes in schooling.  \n28 \n41\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 42 of 53\n1  216. Only 31% of all children in foster care as of September 30, 2012, for whom \n2  removal and current zip code information was available, were placed within the same zip \n3  code as their homes.  Moreover, nearly half of these children were placed outside their \n4  home city.  \n5  217. Consultants retained by DES reported that in 2011, almost 60% of children in \n6  state foster care were placed over an hour from their homes.  As the consultant recognized, \n7  โ[t]his makes parent visits and services difficult and contributes to Ongoing staff driving \n8  more hours and spending more time away from their other cases.โ \n9 \nC.  Because of the Shortage of Foster Homes, Members of the Non-Kinship \nSubclass Are Frequently Separated from Their Siblings. \n10 \n11  218. For children entering state foster care, siblings can serve as a crucial buffer \n12  against the emotional upheaval  of being separated from their parents.  Sibling relationships \n13  can also promote resilience as children navigate the trauma of removal.  In recognition of \n14  the importance of maintaining sibling relationships, federal law requires states to make \n15  reasonable efforts to place siblings together, unless contrary to a siblingโs safety or well-\n16  being โ a requirement echoed in Arizona state policy.  \n17  219. DCSโs failure to maintain an adequate array of foster homes harms members \n18  of the Non-Kinship Subclass by causing them to be separated, or putting them at an \n19  unreasonable risk of being separated, from their siblings.  As of September 30, 2013, the \n20  state child welfare agency failed to place all siblings together in 35% of cases, and failed to \n21  place at least two siblings together in 24% of cases.  Based on information the state child \n22  welfare agency submitted to the federal government in 2012, in nearly 40% of cases when \n23  at least two siblings entered out-of-home care, the state child welfare agency failed to \n24  place them together.  The Sstate child welfare agencyโs performance was nearly as bad \n25  every year from 2008 through 2011.  A DES official acknowledged  in 2012 that it had \n26  become more difficult to place siblings in the same home because of the shortage of foster \n27  families and because more children stay in care longer. \n28 \n42\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 43 of 53\n1  220. A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n2  United States Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it \n3  takes that child into its legal foster care custody. \n4  221. Defendant McKay directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n5  child welfare policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing DCS policies and practices fail \n6  to satisfy its affirmative duty to protect the Non-Kinship Subclass, including the Named \n7  Plaintiffs, from an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm.  These failures are a \n8  substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, the ongoing violation of the Non-\n9  Kinship Subclassโs constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights. \n10  222. The foregoing policies and practices of DCS described herein constitute a \n11  policy, pattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside the exercise \n12  of any professional judgment, and amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally \n13  protected rights and liberty and privacy interests of the Named Plaintiffs and other \n14  members of the Non-Kinship Subclass.  As a result, all members of the Non-Kinship \n15  Subclass have been harmed or are being subjected to an ongoing unreasonable risk of \n16  harm, in deprivation of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n17  Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n18  223. These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  the right \n19  of members of the Non-Kinship Subclass to protection from harm and unreasonable risk of \n20  harm while in state foster care custody; the right to a living environment that protects the \n21  physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being of the Non-Kinship Subclass; the \n22  right to necessary treatment, care and services to prevent members of the Non-Kinship \n23  Subclass from deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise \n24  while in state foster care; and the right to adequate caseworker supervision and monitoring \n25  of the Non-Kinship Subclassโs safety and well-being.  \n26  224. As of September 30, 2014, there were 9,454 members of the Non-Kinship \n27  Subclass.  The Non-Kinship Subclass is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder \n28  impracticable. \n43\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 44 of 53\n1  225. Named Plaintiffsโ Fourth Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n2  are common to, and typical of, all members of the Non-Kinship Subclass.  Such common \n3  questions of fact include:  \n4  a.  Whether DCS maintains an adequate number and array of foster home \n5  placements for members of the Non-Kinship Subclass; and  \n6  b.  Whether a shortage of foster homes subjects members of the Non-\n7  Kinship Subclass to an unreasonable risk of being placed far from their families, \n8  schools and home communities.  \n9  226. Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n10  violate the Non-Kinship Subclassโs substantive due process rights to be free from harm \n11  and an unreasonable risk of harm while in state foster care custody. \n12  227. Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Non-\n13  Kinship Subclass they seek to represent.  \n14  228. Named Plaintiffs and the putative Non-Kinship Subclass are represented by: \n15  a.    Attorneys employed by Perkins Coie LLP, an international law firm \n16  with an office in Phoenix, Arizona, whose attorneys have extensive experience in \n17  complex civil and public interest litigation, including class action litigation; \n18  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n19  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n20  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n21  action litigation; and \n22  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n23  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n24  welfare class actions nationally.  \n25  229. The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n26  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Non-Kinship Subclass. \n27 \n28 \n44\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 45 of 53\n1  230. Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n2  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n3  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n4  231. Defendant McKay has acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to \n5  the Non-Kinship Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffsโ \n6  counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the Non-Kinship Subclass. \n7  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION  โ VIOLATION  OF PLAINTIFFSโ  RIGHTS TO \n8  FAMILY  INTEGRITY  UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n232. Paragraphs 1-231 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n9 \n10  233. This claim is asserted against Defendant McKay in his official capacity on \n11  behalf of all members of the General Class who have been assigned a permanency goal of \n12  family reunification (the โReunification Subclassโ). \n13  234. Despite the fact that over 50% of children in state foster care have a \n14  permanency goal of family reunification, the state child welfare agency is failing to \n15  preserve family relationships after children are removed from their homes.  \n16  235. One of the principal ways that states preserve the family relationships of \n17  children in foster care is to place siblings together when they are removed from their \n18  homes, as required under federal and state law.  In 2012, however, Arizona failed to place \n19  siblings together in nearly 40% of cases when at least two siblings entered out-of-home \ncare.  As of September 30, 2013, the state child welfare agency failed to place all siblings \n20 \n21  together in 35% of cases, and failed to place at least two siblings together in 24% of cases.  \n22  236. Moreover, as alleged in paragraphs  215-217 above, the state child welfare \nagency routinely places children in its care far from their home communities, knowingly \n23 \n24  interfering with their ability to maintain connections with their families.  \n25  237. Another way that states preserve the family relationships of children in foster \n26  care is to place such children, when appropriate, with one or both biological parents on a \n27  โtrial reunificationโ basis, while maintaining legal custody over the child.  Arizona, \n28  however, systematically fails to do so.  As of September 30, 2014, only 0.21% of children \n45\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 46 of 53\n1  in state foster care custody (36 out of 16,990 children) were placed with their parents on a \n2  trial reunification basis.  \n3  238. As of September 30, 2013, only 0.29% of children in out-of-home care (23 of \n4  the 7,875 children) who had a permanency goal of family reunification were in a trial \n5  reunification placement.  \n6  239. Similarly, only 1.6% of the children in care who exited to reunification during \n7  federal fiscal year 2012 (60 out of 3,684) were in a trial home visit placement at the time \n8  of exit.  The national average was 37.5%.  Moreover, only 0.5% of children in custody \n9  during federal fiscal year 2012 (97 out of 21,267) had a most recent placement type of trial \n10  home visit.  The national average was 11.0%.  \n11  240. When children in state foster care custody are not placed with their families on \n12  a trial reunification basis, DCS is under a legal duty to coordinate contact between these \n13  children and their biological parents, as well as any siblings from whom the child may \n14  have been separated when taken into custody.  The state child welfare agency has \n15  recognized that โthere is a strong correlation between consistent and timely visitation and \n16  positive outcomes for children who have been removed from their home.  Regular parent-\n17  child visitation, along with CPS Specialistsโ visits with the child, are both associated with \n18  achieving permanency and other indicators of child well-being.โ   \n19  241. For 2012, however, the state child welfare agency reported that barely half \n20  (51%) of children in out-of-home care whose cases were reviewed as part of the child \n21  welfare agencyโs PICR had visits with their parents and siblings at a frequency consistent \n22  with the childโs safety and best interests.  During calendar year 2013, a similarly low \n23  percentage of children (56%) whose cases were reviewed in connection with the PICR had \n24  adequate visits with parents and siblings.     \n25  242. The state child welfare agencyโs poor performance in coordinating family \n26  visits is no surprise given the long wait lists that children in foster care face before being \n27  provided with transportation to and from, and supervision of, family visits.  As of October \n28  2013, there were 475 families waiting for such visitation services.  Remarkably, the state \n46\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 47 of 53\n1  child welfare agency does not even track how long families have been waiting for those \n2  services.  \n3  243. The state child welfare agency further impairs family relationships by \n4  routinely failing to comply with its obligation to make monthly contact with the biological \n5  parents of children in state foster care.  During the six-month period from April 1, 2014 \n6  through September 30, 2014, 1,213 out of 2,528 (48.0% of) parents of children in foster \n7  care with a case plan goal of reunification did not receive required visits from a state child \n8  welfare caseworker.  \n9  244. Likewise, during the six-month period from October 1, 2013 through \n10  March 31, 2014, 1,152 out of 2,496 (46.2% of) parents of children in foster care with a \n11  case plan goal of reunification did not receive required visits from a state caseworker.  \n12  245. DCS recently reported that during 2013, caseworkers made concerted efforts to \n13  have adequate contact with mothers in only 36% of cases reviewed, and with fathers in \n14  only 18% of cases reviewed. \n15  246. Not surprisingly, given the state child welfare agencyโs failure to make \n16  adequate contact with the biological parents of children in foster care, the agency also \n17  systematically fails to involve those parents in their childrenโs case planning.  During \n18  2013, the state child welfare agency made concerted efforts to actively involve the childโs \n19  mother in case planning in only slightly more than half (54%) of cases reviewed,  and to \n20  involve the father in little more than a third (36%) of cases.  According to DCS, โ[c]ase \n21  plans are not consistently developed and reassessed within required timeframes.โ \n22  247. An all too predictable result of the state child welfare agencyโs failure to \n23  preserve family relationships is that far too few members of the Reunification Subclass are \n24  reunified with their families.  Moreover, when reunification does occur, it takes far too \n25  long.  \n26  248. The amount of time that members of the Reunification Class spend in out-of-\n27  home care before being reunified with their families has also increased over time.  \n28  According to data prepared for the state child welfare agency, the percentage of children \n47\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 48 of 53\n1  who reunified within 90 days decreased from 30% for children who entered state foster \n2  care in 2008 to 18% for children who entered such care in 2012; the percentage of children \n3  who reunified within six months fell from 35% for the 2008 entry group to 23% for the \n4  2012 entry group; and the percentage of children who reunified within one year fell from \n5  44% for the 2008 entry group to 37% for the 2012 entry group.    \n6  249. DCS is aware of its poor performance.  According to a 2014 agency report, \n7  โ[c]ompared  to prior years, children are now less likely to exit to reunification, and they \n8  experience longer lengths of stay before reunifying.โ     \n9  250. The foregoing DCS practices interfere with the right to family integrity held by \n10  members of the Reunification Subclass, and subject them to emotional harm and an \n11  unreasonable risk of emotional harm.  \n12  251. Defendant McKay directly and indirectly controls and is responsible for the \n13  policies and practices of DCS.  The foregoing policies and practices fail to satisfy DCSโs \n14  affirmative duty to protect the welfare of the Reunification Subclass, which failure is a \n15  substantial factor leading to, and a proximate cause of, the violation of the constitutionally \n16  protected liberty interests, privacy interests and associational rights of all members of the \n17  Reunification Subclass.  \n18  252. The foregoing policies and practices of DCS amount to a policy, pattern, \n19  custom and/or practice that is outside the exercise of any professional judgment and \n20  amounts to deliberate indifference to the Reunification Subclassโs constitutional rights.  \n21  As a result, all members of the Reunification Subclass are being deprived, or are at \n22  unreasonable risk of being deprived, of their liberty interests, privacy interests and \n23  associational rights conferred on them by the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment to \n24  the United States Constitution not to be deprived of child-parent or child-sibling family \n25  relationships. \n26  253. The Reunification Subclass has thousands of members and is therefore \n27  sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder impracticable.  \n28 \n48\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 49 of 53\n1  254. Named Plaintiffsโ Fifth Cause of Action raises questions of fact and law that \n2  are common to, and typical of, all members of the Reunification Subclass.  Such common \n3  questions of fact include:  \n4  a.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of placing members of the \n5  Reunification Subclass far from their home communities;    \n6  b.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to place members of the \n7  Reunification Subclass in trial home reunification settings;  \n8  c.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to coordinate contact \n9  between members of the Reunification Class and their biological families;   \n10  d.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to make required \n11  monthly contact with the biological parents of members of the Reunification \n12  Subclass; and \n13  e.  Whether DCS engages in a practice of failing to involve the biological \n14  parents of members of the Reunification Subclass in the case planning of those \n15  children. \n16  255. Such common questions of law include whether DCSโs actions and inactions \n17  violate the Reunification Subclassโs rights to family integrity, guaranteed by the First, \n18  Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n19  256. Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n20  Reunification Subclass they seek to represent.  \n21  257. Named Plaintiffs and the putative Reunification Subclass are represented by: \n22  a.    Attorneys employed by Perkins Coie LLP, an international law firm \n23  with an office in Phoenix, Arizona, whose attorneys have extensive experience in \n24  complex civil and public interest litigation, including class action litigation; \n25  b.  Attorneys employed by the Arizona Center for Law in the Public \n26  Interest, a nonprofit legal organization based in Phoenix whose attorneys also have \n27  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, including class \n28  action litigation; and \n49\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 50 of 53\n1  c.  Attorneys employed by Childrenโs Rights, Inc., a nonprofit legal \n2  organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in child \n3  welfare class actions nationally.  \n4  258. The attorneys and organizations listed above have investigated all claims in \n5  this action and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Reunification \n6  Subclass. \n7  259. Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \n8  sufficiently familiar with the facts of the childโs situation to fairly and adequately represent \n9  the childโs interests in this litigation. \n10  260. Defendant McKay has acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to \n11  the Reunification Subclass, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffsโ \n12  counsel know of no conflicts between or among members of the Reunification Subclass. \n13  PRAYER  FOR RELIEF \n14  WHEREFORE,  the Named Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n15  A.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \n16  B.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), \n17  Fed. R. Civ. P.; \n18  C.  Declare unconstitutional and unlawful pursuant to Rule 57, Fed. R. Civ. P.:   \n19  1.  DCSโs and DHSโs violation of plaintiffsโ substantive rights to be free \n20  from harm and unreasonable risk of harm under the Due Process Clause of the \n21  Fourteenth Amendment  to the United States Constitution;  \n22  2.  DCSโs violation of the Reunification Subclassโs rights to family \n23  integrity under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n24  Constitution; \n25  3.  DCSโs, DHSโs and AHCCCSโs  violation of plaintiffsโ rights under 42 \n26  U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I), 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(a)(4)(B) and \n27  1396d(r); \n28 \n50\n     \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 37   Filed 06/08/15   Page 51 of 53\n1  D.

Health Care Services Provided to Children in State Foster Care.  \n7  DCS and DHS shall establish and implement practices to ensure that all members of \n8  the General Class receive the physical, mental and behavioral health services to \n9  which they are entitled under the federal substantive Due Process Clause.  Likewise, \n10  DCS, DHS and AHCCCS  shall establish and implement practices to ensure that all \n11  members of the Medicaid Subclass receive the physical, mental and behavioral \n12  health services to which they are entitled under the EPSDT provisions of the federal \n13  Medicaid Act.  \n14  2.  Availability of Necessary Resources for the Placement of \n15  Children.  DCS shall establish and implement practices to ensure a minimally \n16  adequate capacity and array of placements to meet the placement needs of the Non-\n17  Kinship Class, including foster and HCTC homes. \n18  3.  Family Contact and Visitation.  DCS shall establish and implement \n19  practices providing for minimally adequate visitation between members of the \n20  Reunification Subclass and their biological parents and siblings. DCS shall also \n21  establish and implement practices to adequately provide for siblings in the \n22  Reunification Subclass to be placed together in foster care. \n23  4.  Caseworker Investigations. DCS shall establish and implement \n24  practices providing for minimally adequate investigations into reports that members \n25  of the General Class have been abused or neglected.  \n26  5.

(โPlaintiffโ or โB.K.โ), a minor in the custody of \n16  the Arizona foster care system, sought certification of this matter as a class action with \n17  subclasses under Rule 23(b)(2). This Court granted certification of the General Class, the \n18  Non-Kinship  Subclass,  and  the  Medicaid  Subclass.  The  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  the \n19  certification  of  the  General  Class  and  the  Non-Kinship  Subclass,  but  vacated  the \n20  certification  of  the  Medicaid  Subclass  and  remanded  to  this  Court  for  further \n21  consideration of the commonality requirement under Rule 23(a). Plaintiff then filed a \n22  motion to certify the Medicaid Subclass under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2). (Doc. 430.) \n23  Defendants opposed. (Doc. 435.) For reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion \n24  for certification of the Medicaid Subclass. \n25  BACKGROUND \n26    Plaintiff filed this civil rights class action on behalf of children in the custody of \n27  the Arizona foster care system, claiming the Arizona foster care system violates the U.S. \n28  Constitution and the Medicaid Act. (Doc. 37.) She alleges Arizonaโs uniform, statewide \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 2 of 32\n \n \n \n1  policies and practices in the foster care system exposed her and all other foster children to \n2  harm or unreasonable risk of harm while in the stateโs care, in violation of federal rights. \n3  (Id.) Of particular relevance here, she alleges the policies and practices of the Arizona \n4  Department of Child Safety (โDCSโ) and the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment \n5  System (โAHCCCSโ) subject foster children to a significant risk of denial of medically \n6  necessary health care. (Id.) \n7    In 2017, this Court originally granted Plaintiffโs motion for class certification and \n8  certified three groups of children: (1) all children who are or will be in the legal custody \n9  of DCS due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect (the โGeneral Classโ); (2) all \n10  members in the General Class who are not placed in the care of an adult relative or \n11  person who has a significant relationship with the child (the โNon-Kinship Subclassโ); \n12  and (3) all members of the General Class who are entitled to early and periodic screening, \n13  diagnostic, and treatment services  under the federal  Medicaid statute (the โMedicaid \n14  Subclassโ).  (Doc.  363.)  Plaintiff  asserted  constitutional  due  process  claims  for  the \n15  General Class and the Non-Kinship Subclass. Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that DCS \n16  violated substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to \n17  care  adequately  for  the  General  Class,  and  by  placing  the  Non-Kinship  Subclass  at \n18  substantial risk of harm. For the Medicaid Subclass, Plaintiff asserted only a Medicaid \n19  Act claim. \n20    Defendants appealed the class certification to the Ninth Circuit. (Docs. 365; 366.) \n21  On April 26, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion affirming the certification of the \n22  General Class, holding this Court โproperly grounded its commonality determination in \n23  the constitutionality of statewide policies and practices,โ which โare the โglueโ that holds \n24  the class together.โ B.K., by next friend Tinsley v. Snyder, 922 F.3d 957, 969 (9th Cir. \n25  2019) (citing Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014)).1 The Ninth Circuit \n                                              \n26  1 The nine statewide practices affecting the General Class are: (1) failure to provide \ntimely access to health care, including comprehensive evaluations, timely annual visits, \n27 \nsemi-annual  preventative  dental  health  care,  adequate  health  assessments, \nand immunizations; (2) failure to coordinate physical and dental care service delivery; (3) \n28 \nineffective coordination and monitoring of DCS physical and dental services; (4) overuse \nof  congregate  care  for  children  with  unmet  mental  needs;  (5)  excessive  caseworker \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 3 of 32\n \n \n \n1  also affirmed the certification of the Non-Kinship Subclass, holding that โ[a]s with the \n2  General Class, commonality, typicality, and uniformity of injunctive relief were satisfied \n3  by  identifying  [three  statewide]  practices  because  the  district  court  will  be  able  to \n4  determine whether [Defendants] have an unconstitutional practice of placing children in \n5  substantial risk of harm by evaluating these practices as a whole, rather than as to each \n6  individual class member.โ 2 Id. at 973.  \n7    The Ninth Circuit reversed the certification of the Medicaid Subclass because \n8  certification of the Medicaid Subclass was โbased on an apparent misconception of the \n9  legal framework for such a claim.โ Id. at 975. The Ninth Circuit formulated two distinct \n10  legal theories that could justify certifying the Medicaid Subclass. First, โwhether every \n11  child in the Medicaid Subclass is subjected to the same state-wide policy or practice that \n12  violates  the  Medicaid  Act.โ  Id.  at  976โ77.  Second,  whether  a  state-wide  โpolicy  or \n13  practice could expose every child in the subclass to a significant risk of an imminent \n14  future Medicaid violation.โ Id. at 977. The Ninth Circuit held โ[u]nder this [second] \n15  theory, the plaintiffs . . . may challenge the Medicaid violation before it has taken place, \n16  so long as the requisite โsignificant riskโ exists, so commonality may exist based on a \n17  finding that all class members are subjected to the same risk.โ Id. \n18    Certification of the Medicaid Subclass was remanded to this Court for further \n19  proceedings based on the Ninth Circuitโs proposed commonality standard, specifically on \n20  the question of whether โevery subclass member was subject to an identical โsignificant \n21  riskโ  of  a  future  Medicaid  violation  that  would  support  injunctive  relief.โ  Id.  Judge \n22  Adelman dissented from the vacatur of the Medicaid Subclass certification order, finding \n23  this  Court  did  not  err  in  applying  Rule  23  standards,  and  noting  that,  at  the  class \n24  certification stage, Plaintiff did not have to prove โthat the defendantsโ policies are in fact \n25 \n                                                                                                                                                  \n26 \ncaseloads;  (6) failure  to investigate reports  of abuse timely; (7) failure to  document \nโsafety assessmentsโ;  (8) failure to close investigations timely;  and (9) investigation \n27 \ndelays. \n2 The three statewide practices affecting the Non-Kinship Sublcass are: (1) excessive use \n28 \nof emergency shelters and group homes; (2) unnecessary separation of siblings; and (3) \nplacement of children far from home. \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 4 of 32\n \n \n \n1  deficient,โ but simply โthat the question of whether the policies are deficient can be \n2  resolved on a class-wide basis.โ Id. at 982 (Adelman, J., concurring in part and dissenting \n3  in part). \n4    On remand, Plaintiff sought leave to seek certification of the Medicaid Subclass \n5  โnot because Defendants violated the Medicaid Act but because each class member is \n6  subject to a significant risk that Defendants will violate the Medicaid Act.โ (Doc. 425 at \n7  2.)3 The Court granted Plaintiffโs request to file this motion. (Doc. 425.) \n8  ANALYSIS \n9    Plaintiff  seeks  to  certify  the  Medicaid  Subclass  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \n10  Procedure 23. Under Rule 23(a), a party seeking certification of a subclass must satisfy \n11  four prerequisite requirements: (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) \n12  adequacy of representation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4). If the initial requirements are \n13  met,  Plaintiffโs  proposed  subclass  must  also  satisfy  the  requirements  of  one  of  the \n14  subsections of Rule 23(b), โwhich defines three different types of classes.โ See Leyva v. \n15  Medline Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2013). Here, Plaintiff seeks to certify the \n16  Medicaid Subclass pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that โthe party opposing the \n17  class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n18  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as \n19  a whole.โ See Fed.

The Medicaid Statute \n7    The  parties  disagree  on  what  the  Medicaid  Act  requires  regarding  early  and \n8  periodic  screening,  diagnostic,  and  treatment  services  (โEPSDTโ),  and  what  would \n9  establish a violation. This fundamental question underlies resolution of all other issues in \n10  the class certification motion. \n11  A. The Relevant Medicaid Statutes \n12  EPSDT services are defined in the Medicaid Act. The statute defines the term \n13  โearly and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment servicesโ to mean five items and \n14  services:  (1) screening services4; (2) vision services; (3) dental services;  (4) hearing \n15  services; and (5) โSuch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and \n16  other  measuresโ as are necessary to โcorrect or ameliorate  defects and physical and \n17 \n                                              \n18  4 Screening services are services: \n(A) which are providedโ \n19 \n(i)  at  intervals  which  meet  reasonable  standards  of  medical  and \ndental  practice,  as  determined  by  the  State  after  consultation  with \n20 \nrecognized medical and dental organizations involved in child health care \nand,  with  respect  to  immunizations  under  subparagraph  (B)(iii),  in \n21 \naccordance with the schedule referred to in section 1396s(c)(2)(B)(i) of this \ntitle for pediatric vaccines, and \n22 \n(ii)  at  such  other  intervals,  indicated  as  medically  necessary,  to \ndetermine  the  existence  of  certain  physical  or  mental  illnesses  or \n23 \nconditions; and \n(B) which shall at a minimum includeโ \n24 \n(i)  a  comprehensive  health  and  developmental  history  (including \nassessment of both physical and mental health development), \n25 \n(ii) a comprehensive unclothed physical exam, \n(iii) appropriate immunizations (according to the schedule referred \n26 \nto in section 1396s(c)(2)(B)(i) of this title for pediatric vaccines) according \nto age and health history, \n27 \n(iv)  laboratory  tests  (including  lead  blood  level  assessment \nappropriate for age and risk factors), and \n28 \n(v) health education (including anticipatory guidance). \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1). \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 6 of 32\n \n \n \n1  mental illnesses and conditions.โ5 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(1)โ(5).

Sections 441.56, the required activities, and 441.58, the \n12  periodicity schedule, are particularly important to the resolution of the class certification \n13  motion. \n14    The required activities include: (a) informing all EPSDT eligible individuals and \n15  their  families  about  the  programโs  details  (ยง 441.56(a))8;  (b)  screening,  or  โperiodic \n16  comprehensive child health assessments,โ which โmust be provided in accordance with \n17  reasonable standards of medical and dental practiceโ (ยง 441.56(b))9; (c) diagnosis and \n18  treatment,  including  immunizations  and  treatment  for  vision,  hearing,  and  dental \n19  problems which would not otherwise be covered by Medicaid if the screening indicates a \n20  need (ยง 441.56(c))10; (d) accountability (ยง 441.56(d)); and (e) timeliness (ยง 441.56(e)).11  \n21 \n                                                                                                                                                  \nchildren described in section 1397hh(e) of this title and \n22 \n(iv) the Stateโs results in attaining the participation goals set for the \nState under section 1396d(r) of this title. \n23 \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(43) (footnote omitted). \n8 Recipients of EPSDT services must be informed, among other things, โThat necessary \n24 \ntransportation and scheduling assistance described in ยง 441.62 of this subpart is available \nto the EPSDT eligible individual upon request.โ ยง 441.56(a)(2)(iv). \n25  9 Periodic comprehensive child health assessments are โregularly scheduled examinations \nand evaluations of the general physical and mental health, growth, development, and \n26 \nnutritional status of infants, children, and youth.โ 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(b)(1). \n10 โIn addition to any diagnostic and treatment services included in the plan, the agency \n27 \nmust provide to eligible EPSDT beneficiaries, the following services, the need for which \nis  indicated  by  screening,  even  if  the  services  are  not  included  in  the  planโ:  โ(1) \n28 \nDiagnosis of and treatment for defects in vision and hearing, including eyeglasses and \nhearing aids; (2) Dental care, at as early an age as necessary, needed for relief of pain and \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 8 of 32\n \n \n \n1    The periodicity schedule must meet โreasonable standards of medical and dental \n2  practiceโ and specify โscreening services applicable at each stage of the beneficiaryโs \n3  life.โ 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.58. Arizona publishes its periodicity schedule for EPSDT services \n4  in the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (โAMPMโ). For children ages 3โ20, Arizona \n5  requires that every child receive an annual well-child physical examination, at which \n6  their blood pressure is taken, their social-emotional health is assessed, they are weighed \n7  and measured, and other procedures are conducted.12 AMPM Policy 430, Exhibit 430-1. \n8  The parties refer to this physical examination somewhat interchangeably as โwell-child \n9  exams,โ โWell-Child Visits,โ โWell-Care Visits,โ and โEPSDT Exams.โ (Docs. 430 at \n10  10, 435 at 9, 392-4 at 19.) In addition, every child must see a dentist every six months, \n11  and receive immunizations and vision and hearing screenings if indicated for their age. \n12  AMPM  Policy  430,  Exhibit  430-1.  The  AMPM  concludes  โThese  are  minimum \n13  requirements.  If at any time other procedures, tests, etc. are medically indicated, the \n14  physician is obligated to perform them.  If a child comes under care for the first time at \n15  any point on the schedule, or if any items are not accomplished at the suggested age, the \n16  schedule should be brought up to date at the earliest possible time.โ13 Id.

To  be  clear,  every  eligible  child  must  receive  a  well-child  physical \n21  examination  each  year,  a  dental  examination  every  six  months,  and  immunizations, \n22  visual, and hearing screening based on their age. Evidence that any eligible child did not \n23  receive EPSDT services is evidence of a Medicaid violation. \n24  B. The Partiesโ Positions \n25    Plaintiffโs  position  is  that  the  word  โprovideโ  in  the  relevant  statutes  means \n26  Defendants are responsible for ensuring that each and every Medicaid-eligible child in \n27  the custody of the Arizona foster care system actually receives EPSDT services, and \n28  moreover receives those services with reasonable promptness. (Doc. 430 at 7, citing the \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 10 of 32\n \n \n \n1  EPSDT Guide at 32.14) This position is summarized as: โIn short, the EPSDT provisions \n2  of Medicaid require that eligible children โget the health care they need when they need it \n3  โ the right care to the right child at the right time in the right setting,โ which is โthe goal \n4  of  the  EPSDT  provision.โโ  (Id.,  citing  the  EPSDT  Guide  at  1.)  Plaintiff  provided \n5  evidence, through expert reports, that โmany foster children have not received mandated \n6  physical and dental EPSDT examinations,โ and alleges that the causes of the problem are \n7  Defendantsโ state-wide policies and practices. (Id. at 9.) \n8    Defendantsโ position is that Arizona is not required to ensure that the children \n9  receive  EPSDT  services;  rather,  Arizona  must  ensure  only  that  EPSDT  services  are \n10  available. (Doc. 435 at 7, 13). Furthermore, Defendants state that if EPSDT services \n11  result in a recommendation for treatment, such treatment is timely if it occurs within six \n12  months. (Id. at 9.) Defendants summarize their position as: โNeither the statute, the rules, \n13  CMS, nor CMSโs EPSDT Guide tasks the states with guaranteeing that children receive \n14  the  services  that  Defendants  make  available.โ  (Id.  at  13.)  Defendants  attempt  to \n15  controvert Plaintiffโs expert reports  by arguing the experts do not  explicitly  cite the \n16  Medicaid standards. (Id. at 7.)  \n17  C. Violations of the Medicaid Act \n18    In interpreting the EPSDT requirements of the Medicaid Act, the Court is guided \n19  by Katie A., ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles County, 481 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007) and the \n20  canons of statutory construction. โA primary canon of statutory interpretation is that the \n21  plain language of a statute should be enforced according to its terms, in light of its \n22  context.โ Wadler v. Bio-Rad Labs., Inc., 916 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n23  ASARCO, LLC v. Celanese Chem. Co., 792 F.3d 1203, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015)).  \n24    States that have chosen to provide Medicaid to their citizens โhave an obligation to \n25  cover every type of health care or service necessary for EPSDT corrective or ameliorative \n26 \n                                              \n14 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, U.S. Depโt of Health & Human Services., \n27 \nEPSDT โ A Guide for States: Coverage in the Medicaid Benefit for Children and \nAdolescents (June 2014), \n28 \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/benefits/downloads/epsdt_coverage_guide.pdf \n(hereinafter โEPSDT Guideโ). \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 11 of 32\n \n \n \n1  purposes,โ and โan obligation to see that the services are provided when screening reveals \n2  that they are medically necessary for a child.โ Katie A., 482 F.3d at 1158 (citing 42 \n3  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1396a(a)(43)(C),  1396d(a)).  In  a  highly  analogous  case  in  the  District  of \n4  Massachusetts addressing the provision of EPSDT services, the court made clear that \n5  under Medicaid, children are owed greater benefits than adults. Rosie D. v. Romney, 410 \n6  F. Supp. 2d 18, 25 (D. Mass. 2006) (โAs broad as the overall Medicaid umbrella is \n7  generally, the initiatives aimed at children are far more expansive.โ). This obligation is \n8  active, not passive, and may require the state to be proactive in arranging for services, \n9  since โthe ultimate responsibility to ensure treatment remains with the state.โ Katie A., \n10  482 F.3d at 1158โ59 (collecting cases); see Rosie D., 410 F. Supp. 2d at 27 (โ[T]he \n11  [Medicaid] Act requires a proactive approach.โ). โ[S]tates do have broader Medicaid \n12  obligations  to  children  than  to  other  populations  of  Medicaid  recipients.โ  Alvarez  v. \n13  Betlach, No. CV 09-558 TUC AWT, 2012 WL 10861543, at *6 (D. Ariz. May 21, 2012), \n14  affโd in part, vacated in part, 572 F. Appโx 519 (9th Cir. 2014). \n15    A  closer  look  at  previous  Ninth  Circuit  caselaw  establishes  Defendantsโ \n16  interpretation of their own obligations is incorrect. The district court in Katie A. held that \n17  state agencies were required to โprovide services to class members, rather than simply \n18  make such services available.โ Katie A., 481 F.3d at 1162 (emphasis added). On appeal, \n19  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  this  interpretation  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  holding  that \n20  โ[r]equiring the State actually to provide EPSDT services that have been found to be \n21  medically necessary is consistent with the language of the Medicaid Act, which requires \n22  that  each  state  plan  โprovide  for  . . .  arranging  for  (directly  or  through  referral  to \n23  appropriate  agencies,  organizations,  or  individuals)  corrective  treatment  the  need  for \n24  which is disclosed by such child health screening services.โโ Id.

Supp. 2d at 26 (โCongressโ \n26  firm  intent  to  ensure  that  Medicaid-eligible  children  actually  receive  services  is \n27  powerfully underlined by provisions in the statute that place explicit duties on states toโ \n28  inform children of the availability of EPSDT services, โprovide or arrange forโ services \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 12 of 32\n \n \n \n1  every  time  they  are  requested,  and  โarrange  for  whatever  corrective  treatments  are \n2  discovered to be needed.โ) (citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(43; 42 C.F.R. ยงยง 441.56(a)(1), \n3  441.61, 441.62) (emphasis added). \n4    The Ninth Circuitโs approach in Katie A. comports with the plain language of the \n5  statute  and  regulations,  which  requires  the  provision  of  EPSDT  services,  not  the \n6  availability  of  services.  See  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396a(a)(43)  (state  Medicaid  plans  โmust \n7  provide forโ. . . such screening servicesโ); 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(b)(1) (AHCCCS โmust \n8  provide . . . screeningโ); 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(c) (AHCCCS โmust provideโ dental, vision, \n9  and hearing services, and immunizations); 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.59 (AHCCCS โmust provide \n10  the screening servicesโ); and A.R.S. ยง 8-512(A) (DCS โshall provide comprehensive \n11  medical and dental careโ).  \n12    The State Medicaid Manual confirms this interpretation, describing the EPSDT \n13  program as โA Comprehensive Child Health Programโ which โconsists of two, mutually \n14  supportive, operational components: assuring the availability and accessibility of required \n15  health care resources and helping Medicaid recipients and their parents or guardians \n16  effectively  use  them.โ  State  Medicaid  Manual  ยง  5010(B).15  The  position  taken  by \n17  Defendants addresses only the first component. \n18  Not only must the state ensure that EPSDT services are provided in the first place, \n19  it โalso must ensure that the EPSDT services provided are reasonably effective.โ Katie A., \n20  481 F.3d at 1159. And as the Ninth Circuit held in this case, โ[t]he most natural reading \n21  of the Act and our precedents is that a violation occurs when EPSDT services have failed \n22  to be provided in a timely manner.โ Tinsley, 922 F.3d at 976.  \n23  Defendants disagree that they are responsible for ensuring that children receive \n24  care, asserting generally that โthere are many reasons, beyond Defendantsโ controlโ why \n25  children in the custody of Arizonaโs foster care system do not receive timely medical care \n26  according  to  AHCCCSโs  own  periodicity  schedule  of  screenings  and  treatments, \n27  including that โsome children do not need services,โ โ[n]ot everyone wants or requests \n                                              \n28  15  Available  for  download  at  https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-\nGuidance/Guidance/Manuals/Paper-Based-Manuals-Items/CMS021927.html. \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 13 of 32\n \n \n \n1  help  that  is  available,โ  and  many  children  โsimply  fail  to  show  for  their  medical \n2  appointments.โ (Doc. 435 at 11.)  \n3  The Court does not find these arguments persuasive. The AHCCCS periodicity \n4  schedule requires an annual well-child physical examination, as well as a dental referral \n5  every six months, and concludes โThese are minimum requirements.โ AMPM Policy 430, \n6  Exhibit  430-1  (emphasis  in  original).  Having  complied  with  the  Medicaid  statute  to \n7  determine the appropriate care intervals which โmeet reasonable standards of medical and \n8  dental  practice,โ  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396d(r)(1),  Defendants  cannot  now  baldly  assert  that \n9  โsome children do not need services.โ (Doc. 435 at 11.) To the contrary, every child \n10  needs  medical  services  at  least  once  per  year.  An  assertion  that  Medicaid-eligible \n11  children do not require any medical services is directly contrary to Congressโ intent and \n12  the plain language of the Medicaid Act. \n13  Nor does the burden lie on a child to request help. The Medicaid Act requires that \n14  state proactively โidentify obstacles to the effective conveyance of informationโ and \n15  mitigate  the  negative  impact  of  such  obstacles;  if  Arizonaโs  โscheme  for  informing \n16  children of their rights is ineffective . . . [Arizona] is not in compliance with the law.โ \n17  Rosie D., 410 F. Supp. 2d at 26โ27. Thus, Arizona may not simply shrug indifferently \n18  when children do not request help, but instead must first affirmatively determine what \n19  obstacles lie between the children and the โhelp that is available,โ and then mitigate those \n20  obstacles. (Doc. 435 at 11.) \n21  Nor is it the childโs fault if a child fails to show up for their medical appointment. \n22  The Court reminds Defendants once again that the members of the Medicaid Subclass are \n23  children.16  The  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  a  minor  child  attends  a  medical \n24 \n                                              \n16 Some members of the Medicaid Subclass are infants and toddlers. Many others are too \n25 \nyoung to take public transit, if public transit is even available to them. Children under the \nage of 15 years and six months may not operate motor vehicles in the state of Arizona. \n26 \nSee  Arizona  Depโt  of  Transportation,  https://azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/driver-\nservices/driver-license-classes-and-types. And even those children who are old enough to \n27 \ndrive  might  not  have  access  to  a  car.  Furthermore,  it  is  simply  common  sense  that \nchildren,  particularly  foster  children,  do  not  have  the  requisite  skills  or  access  to \n28 \nresources  to  make  alternative  transportation  arrangements  or  negotiate  the  obstacles \nsurrounding their medical care alone. \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 14 of 32\n \n \n \n1  appointment rests not with the child, but with the guardian of the child. Furthermore, \n2  Defendants are required to inform children in the Medicaid Subclass โThat necessary \n3  transportation and scheduling assistance described in ยง 441.62 of this subpart is available \n4  to  the  EPSDT  eligible  individual  upon  requestโ  and  Defendants  must  provide  such \n5  assistance. 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(a)(2)(iv). Defendants cite studies which attribute medical \n6  appointment no-shows to a lack of transportation, but if a foster family fails to bring a \n7  child to their appointment because of a lack of transportation, the ultimate responsibility \n8  lies  with  Defendants  for  not  informing  the  family  that  transportation  assistance  is \n9  available and then providing such necessary assistance.17 (Doc. 435 at 11 n.8.) The Court \n10  notes  with  concern  that  Defendantโs  comparison  between  foster  children  missing \n11  pediatrician  appointments  and  patients  at  substance  use  disorder  outpatient  clinics \n12  missing addiction treatment appointments is particularly inapposite. (Id.) \n13  Defendants  assert  that  โPlaintiffsโ  premise  that  Defendants  violate  the  law \n14  whenever a child misses a service is false.โ (Doc. 435 at 12.) But it is Defendantsโ \n15  assertion that is false. The Court holds that the Medicaid Act requires Defendants to \n16  proactively ensure that each child eligible for EPSDT services actually receives such \n17  services in a timely manner. It is not sufficient for Defendants merely to make EPSDT \n18  services available. Therefore, a violation of the Medicaid Act occurs when a child in the \n19  Medicaid Subclass does not receive EPSDT services at all, or does not receive them in a \n20  timely manner. The timeliness of an EPSDT service is determined by whether the child \n21  received the service according to the schedule set forth in the AHCCCS Medicaid Policy \n22  Manual.18 Consistent with 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(e), a child must begin treatment no later \n23  than six months after the screening that established the need for the treatment.  \n24 \n25 \n                                              \n17  The  Court  recognizes  that  even  if  Defendants  provide  transportation,  some  foster \n26 \nfamilies  might  still  miss  the  occasional  medical  appointment.  In  those  instances, \nDefendants  must  make  all  reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  children  receive  the \n27 \nnecessary care as soon as possible. Defendants may not abdicate their responsibility to \nensure that the children actually receive care.  \n28  18 The AHCCCS Medicaid Policy Manual must continue to meet reasonable standards of \nmedical and dental practice. \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 15 of 32\n \n \n \n1  II.  Class Certification \n2    The question remaining for the purpose of class certification is whether there is a \n3  common question of law or fact such that every member of the Medicaid Subclass is \n4  subject to an identical significant risk of an imminent future Medicaid violation that \n5  would support injunctive relief; and if so, if the typicality and Rule 23(b)(2) requirements \n6  have also been met.  \n7  Plaintiff has identified five policies and practices which she alleges โcreate  a \n8  significant  uniform  risk  that  Subclass  members  will  not  receive  necessary  physical, \n9  dental, and behavioral health services, in violation of the Medicaid statute.โ (Doc. 430 at \n10  15.) These practices are: (1) Defendantsโ practice of failing to provide an adequate array \n11  of behavioral health and therapeutic services for members of the Medicaid Subclass; (2) \n12  Defendantsโ practice of failing to coordinate behavioral health services for members of \n13  the Medicaid Subclass; (3) Defendantsโ practice of failing to provide Medicaid Subclass \n14  members  with  timely  mental  health  services;  (4)  Defendantsโ  practice  of  failing  to \n15  provide  members  of  the  Medicaid  Subclass  with  timely  well-child  visits  and \n16  immunizations; and (5) Defendantsโ practice of ineffectively coordinating and monitoring \n17  physical and dental health care. (Id.) \n18  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to prove that โwhat [Plaintiff] call[s] \n19  โpracticesโ actually exist,โ and that Plaintiff โdo[es] not demonstrate that these practices \n20  violate the Medicaid laws that apply to these allegationsโ or that โall children in foster \n21  care are exposed to an identical risk of imminent violation of those laws.โ (Doc. 435 at \n22  4.) \n23  The  Court  will  first  analyze  each  practice,  and  determine  whether  there  is \n24  sufficient factual support for the purposes of class certification to support Plaintiffโs \n25  allegations  each  practice  exists  and  violates  the  Medicaid  Act.  The  Court  will  then \n26  analyze whether there is commonality such that each member of the Medicaid Subclass is \n27  subject to an identical significant risk of future Medicaid violations, and whether the \n28  typicality and Rule 23(b)(2) requirements have been met. \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 16 of 32\n \n \n \n1  A. Defendantsโ Alleged Practices \n2  i.  Array of Services \n3  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have a practice of failing to provide an adequate \n4  array  of  behavioral  health  and  therapeutic  services  for  members  of  the  Medicaid \n5  Subclass. (Doc. 430 at 15.) Plaintiff cites the report of her expert Marci White, who \n6  asserts that one necessary element in this array is the therapeutic foster home. (Doc. 430 \n7  at  11.)  A  therapeutic  foster  home  is  one  that,  after  receiving  its  initial  license  as  a \n8  professional foster home, receives specialized training to provide both a home and care to \n9  children with such critical behavioral health needs that the only other options are more \n10  restrictive  (such  as  a  hospital,  a  residential  treatment  center,  or  a  therapeutic  group \n11  home). (Doc. 238-2 at 277โ278.) Ms. White examined the availability of therapeutic \n12  foster homes and the waitlists for behavioral health services. (Doc. 392-1 at 26โ34.) Ms. \n13  White states that in 2013, there were 425 therapeutic foster homes for approximately \n14  15,000 children, which was characterized at the time by the Arizona Foster Family-based \n15  Treatment  Association  as  a  shortage.  (Id.  at  26โ27.)  According  to  Ms.  White,  the \n16  numbers of therapeutic foster homes continued to drop, from 310 in February 2016 (with \n17  over 19,000 children in care) to fewer than 300 in August 2016 (with 18,287 children in \n18  care), even though more than 1,000 โemotionally disturbed adolescentsโ may need such \n19  homes. (Id. at 27.) Ms. White noted that Defendantsโ deposition testimony โconfirms that \n20  there  are  โ[n]ot  enough  [therapeutic  foster  home]  providers  and  too  many  children \n21  needing that level of care.โโ (Id. at 29.) She concluded that โthere are too few therapeutic \n22  fosterโ homes, and the โshortage of therapeutic foster care in Arizona creates a serious \n23  gap in the array of services available for children in DCS custody.โ  (Id. at 27โ28.) \n24  Defendants, who did not offer their own expert, do not contest these figures. \n25  Defendants respond that allegations regarding practices of providing inadequate \n26  foster home placements and behavioral health services were made with respect to the \n27  General Class and the Non-Kinship Subclass, but that no such allegations were made \n28  with respect to the Medicaid Subclass in the Second Amended Complaint. (Doc. 435 at \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 17 of 32\n \n \n \n1  7.) The Court finds that consideration of these practices with respect to the Medicaid \n2  Subclass is not foreclosed at the class certification stage because Defendants were put on \n3  notice that those specific practices were being challenged, Plaintiff alleged broadly that \n4  Defendants โhave a practice of failing to provide members of the Medicaid Subclass with \n5  the screening, diagnostic and treatment services required under the EPSDT provisions of \n6  the Medicaid Act,โ and Defendants have not established prejudice. Doc. 37 at 33โ34; see \n7  Golden Grain Macaroni Co. v. FTC, 472 F.2d 882, 886 (9th Cir. 1972) (complaint put \n8  defendant โon notice that the specific practices as well as the alleged over-all scheme . . . \n9  were being challengedโ). \n10  Defendants also respond that 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.61 requires them only to make \n11  providers available, and that Katie A. does not require services to be provided in any \n12  particular form. (Doc. 435 at 7โ8.) But Defendants misunderstand the law. While 42 \n13  C.F.R.  ยง 441.61(b)  relates  to  availability,  ยง  441.61(c)  orders  AHCCCS  to  โmake \n14  appropriate use of State health agenciesโ and โother public health [and] mental health \n15  [programs]  . . .  to  ensure  an  effective  child  health  program.โ  42  C.F.R.  ยง  441.61(c) \n16  (emphasis  added).  And  while  the  specific  sentence  of  Katie  A.  cited  by  Defendants \n17  referred to the Ninth Circuitโs decision that it was not necessary to bundle necessary \n18  services as long as a state provided all necessary services separately, the footnote to that \n19  sentence concluded that โif the State fails adequately to provide the component services, \n20  and the effectiveness of those services requires their coordinated delivery, it may be \n21  appropriate to require the State to provide services packaged together in a particular \n22  form.โ Katie A., 482 F.3d at 1157 n.15. Finally, it is obvious that Arizona cannot ensure \n23  an effective child health program if children cannot access healthcare. \n24  As established in section I.C, supra, the Medicaid Act requires Defendants to \n25  ensure that children actually receive medically necessary services. The Court credits Ms. \n26  Whiteโs  decades  of  experience  โwith  the  design,  implementation,  management,  and \n27  monitoring of behavioral health service systems for children involved in the foster care, \n28  mental health, and juvenile justice systems,โ and finds her conclusion that โ[t]he shortage \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 18 of 32\n \n \n \n1  of  therapeutic  foster  care  in  Arizona  creates  a  serious  gap  in  the  array  of  services \n2  available for children in DCS custodyโ to be credible. (Doc. 392-1 at 5, 28.) Accordingly, \n3  the  Court  finds  sufficient  uncontroverted  factual  support  for  purposes  of  class \n4  certification for Plaintiffโs allegation that Defendants have a practice of failing to provide \n5  an  adequate  array  of  behavioral  health  and  therapeutic  services  for  members  of  the \n6  Medicaid Subclass. \n7  ii.  Coordination of Services \n8  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants have two practices related to coordination: a \n9  practice of failing to coordinate behavioral health services for members of the Medicaid \n10  Subclass; and a practice of ineffectively coordinating and monitoring physical and dental \n11  health care. (Doc. 430 at 15.) Defendants respond that while Plaintiff alleged a failure to \n12  coordinate as a violation of due process, Plaintiff did not explicitly allege that Defendants \n13  violated 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.61(c). (Doc. 435 at 8.) \n14  As discussed in Section II.A.i, supra, the Court finds that consideration of these \n15  practices with respect to the Medicaid Subclass is not foreclosed at the class certification \n16  stage because Defendants were put on notice that those specific practices were being \n17  challenged,  Plaintiff  alleged  that  Defendants  have  a  practice  of  โfailing  to  provide \n18  members of the Medicaid Subclass with medically necessary diagnostic and treatment \n19  services,โ and Defendants have not shown prejudice. Doc. 37 at 34; see Golden Grain, \n20  472 F.2d at 886.  \n21  Courts  have  recognized  the  essentiality  of  โcentralized,  knowledgeable,  and \n22  painstaking service coordinationโ in ensuring that children, particularly children with \n23  complex behavioral health needs, actually receive all of the treatment to which they are \n24  entitled under the Medicaid Act. Rosie D., 410 F. Supp. 2d at 31; id. at 32 (noting that \n25  children with complex problems are at risk โthat a lack of coordination among the service \n26  providers will undermine the effectiveness of the treatment that they do receiveโ); see G. \n27  v. Hawaii, 676 F. Supp. 2d 1006, 1017 (D. Haw. 2009) (stating a program intended to \n28  better coordinate services โfurther[ed] the objectives of the Medicaid Actโ).  \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 19 of 32\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff  cites  to  reports  from  their  experts  Ms.  White  and  Arlene  Happach \n2  regarding the essential role DCS case managers (also known as caseworkers) play in \n3  coordinating care. (Doc. 430 at 11โ13.) Specifically, Ms. White stated that the Child and \n4  Family  Team  (CFT)  process  (wherein  the  primary  caregiver,  a  DCS  case  manager \n5  familiar with a childโs needs and treatment history, and other individuals knowledgeable \n6  about a childโs life develop a โbehavioral services plan โto address the behavioral health \n7  treatment needs of the childโโ) โremains broken in Arizona and, as a result, children in \n8  foster care do not get the behavioral health services they need.โ (Doc. 392-1 at 36โ37.) \n9  Ms. White noted several contributing factors, including the failure of case managers to \n10  regularly  participate  in  CFTs;  โevidence  of  insufficient  clinical  oversight  and \n11  involvement in CFTsโ; inadequately trained CFT facilitators; service plans generated \n12  based  not  on  necessary  services  but  on  available  ones;  and  a  lack  of  systematic \n13  monitoring of the process. (Id. at 37.) The regular absence of case managers from the \n14  CFT  process  was  confirmed  through  discovery,  an  absence  which  might  delay  all \n15  behavioral health services requiring DCS consent (including โinpatient psychiatric care \n16  services, residential treatment services, therapeutic group homes,โ and therapeutic foster \n17  homes). (Id. at 38.) \n18  Ms.  Happach  asserted  that  โthe  majority  of  tasks  related  to  placement  and \n19  permanency  are  handled  by  the  case  manager.โ  (Doc.  392-5  at  23.)  She  listed  ten \n20  responsibilities assigned to each case manager by DCS policy, including developing and \n21  monitoring the case plan; โ[e]nsuring that a childโs medical needs are met by arranging \n22  for each child to haveโ medical examinations, immunizations, and all necessary follow-\n23  ups and referrals; โ[e]nsuring that a childโs mental health needs are metโ by taking a child \n24  to intake and assessment appointments, and โ[e]nsuring that appropriate services are \n25  received in a timely mannerโ; and attending CFT meetings. (Id. at 23โ25.) Ms. Happach \n26  stated that in order for a case manager to complete all tasks for all of the children they are \n27  responsible  for,  the  caseload  must  be  manageable.  (Id.  at  25.)  National  guidelines \n28  promulgated by The Child Welfare League of America recommend a caseload of no \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 20 of 32\n \n \n \n1  more  that  12-15  children  in  out-of-home  placements  at  one  time,  while  Arizona \n2  established a โcaseload standardโ of 20 children based on an aggregate time studyโs \n3  finding that a case manager must spend โ120 minutes on placing a child, 120 minutes on \n4  planning and case management, and 360 minutes on court-mandated activities.โ (Id. at \n5  26.) Ms. Happach states that in the first quarter of 2018, โabout half of DCSโs offices had \n6  average out-of-home caseloads of 30 or more.โ (Id. at 27.) \n7  Despite a significant reduction in the number of children in out-of-home care from \n8  16,471 in Q1FY18 to 14,299 in Q4FY19, as of June 2019 many DCS offices continued to \n9  have  extremely  high  caseloads.  Department  of  Child  Safety,  Quarterly  Benchmark \n10  Progress Report Q4 FY2019 at 5โ6 (Sept. 30, 2019).19 For example, out of seven sections \n11  in the Maricopa-East Region with at least one out-of-home child per worker, one section \n12  had a caseload of 22 children per worker and the other six sections had caseloads of 25 or \n13  more (as high as 38 children per worker).  Id. at 6. Similarly, in the Maricopa-West \n14  Region, out of eight sections with at least one out-of-home child per worker, seven \n15  sections had caseloads over 20 children, including six sections with caseloads of 25 or \n16  more, and as high as 32 children per worker. Id. In fact, of the 34 Arizona sections with at \n17  least one out-of-home child per worker, nine sections had caseloads of between one and \n18  20 children, in accordance with Arizonaโs standards; eight sections had caseloads of 21-\n19  24 children; 12 sections had caseloads of 25-29 children; and five sections had caseloads \n20  of over 30 children per worker. Id. This means that 74% of DCS case managers have \n21  caseloads that are not manageable under DCSโs own standard.  \n22  Ms. Happach concluded that overburdened case managers put children at risk, \n23  noting that 75% of the time, case managers โfailed to update their continuous child safety \n24  and risk assessment at the times required by policy,โ and โefforts to assess the physical \n                                              \n25  19  Available  at  https://dcs.az.gov/news-reports/dcs-reports.

Ch. 263 (H.B. 2747) (West). \n \n- 20 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 21 of 32\n \n \n \n1  health needs of children were inadequate in a third of the cases.โ (Doc. 392-5 at 29.)  \n2  The Court credits Plaintiffโs uncontroverted expert opinions that caseworkers are \n3  essential to the proper coordination of physical, dental, and behavioral health care, and \n4  that  an  overloaded  case  manager  with  an  unmanageable  caseload  is  not  properly \n5  coordinating the delivery of such care. The Court also takes judicial notice of the most \n6  recent DCS caseload progress report, which reported 74% of sections had unmanageable \n7  caseloads. Therefore, the Court finds  sufficient factual support for purposes of class \n8  certification  for  Plaintiffโs  allegations  that  Defendants  have  a  practice  of  failing  to \n9  coordinate  behavioral  health  services  for  members  of  the  Medicaid  Subclass,  and  a \n10  practice of ineffectively coordinating and monitoring physical and dental health care. \n11  iii.  Timeliness of Mental Health Services \n12  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have a practice of failing to provide Medicaid \n13  Subclass members with timely mental health services. (Doc. 430 at 15.) Defendants do \n14  not respond specifically to this allegation, but respond to the two โtimelinessโ allegations \n15  (regarding the provision of mental health services, and the provision of well-child visits \n16  and immunizations) collectively. (Doc. 435 at 8โ12.) \n17  To support this allegation, Plaintiff cites to Ms. Whiteโs expert report. (Doc. 430 at \n18  11.) Ms. White devoted several pages of her expert report to her assertion that โChildren \n19  Do Not Receive Timely Mental and Behavioral Health Services Required in Their First \n20  30 Days in Care.โ (Doc. 392-1 at 14โ17.) Ms. White states that after DCS brings a child \n21  into foster care, DCS refers that child to a community-based managed care organization \n22  (known as a Regional Behavioral Health Authority, or โRBHAโ) for a โโRapid Responseโ \n23  to assess the mental and behavioral health needs of the child.โ (Id. at 14.) The RBHA \n24  must conduct the Rapid Response within 72 hours of receiving the referral and forward \n25  the assessment results to DCS. (Id. at 14โ15.) If the Rapid Response assessment identifies \n26  a child as needing mental and behavioral health services, the child is then โreferred for an \n27  โintake appointmentโ or โinitial evaluation and assessmentโ with a RBHA, where the DCS \n28  case worker is supposed to accompany the child.โ (Id. at 15.) The initial assessment \n \n- 21 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 22 of 32\n \n \n \n1  should occur within 7 days of the Rapid Response referral and, if the initial assessment \n2  determines that services are required, the first service must be received within 21 days of \n3  the initial assessment. Id.; A.R.S. ยง 8-512.01.  \n4  Ms.  White  reviewed  โupdated  data  the  RBHAs  reported  to  AHCCCS,โ  and \n5  concluded that in 2016 one of the three RBHAs met the timeliness requirements for under \n6  10% of the foster children it serves, while the other two RBHAs also fell significantly \n7  below the standards. (Doc. 392-1 at 16โ17.) Although Defendants chose not to cite to \n8  their own expert in their response to the class certification motion, their expert Dr. Robert \n9  M.  Freidman  confirmed  the  Rapid  Response  timeline,  and  concluded  that  the  data, \n10  particularly  for  the  seven-day  and  21-day  timelines,  โshows  a  continuing  need  for \n11  improvement.โ (Doc. 393-1 at 16โ17.) Dr. Friedman noted that encounter data from FY \n12  2017 showed that only 56.39% of newly enrolled children received a behavioral health \n13  assessment  within  seven  days,  while  79.67%  received  a  service  within  21  days, \n14  concluding โThis is clearly still a work in progress.โ (Id. at 17.) \n15  Defendants  broadly  challenge  all  of  Plaintiffโs  experts  for  failing  to  cite  a \n16  Medicaid standard. Ms. Whiteโs failure to recite specific statutes does not affect the \n17  reliability of her facts and opinions. The Medicaid Act requires Defendants to provide \n18  screening services necessary โto determine the existence of certain physical or mental \n19  illnesses  or  conditions.โ  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396d(r)(1)(A)(ii).  Arizona  law  requires  these \n20  services to be provided on the schedule Ms. White described.  A.R.S. ยง 8-512.01. If \n21  children do not receive necessary services in a timely manner, the ultimate responsibility \n22  lies  with  Defendants.  Accordingly,  the  Court  credits  Ms.  Whiteโs  report  and  finds \n23  sufficient factual support for purposes of class certification for Plaintiffโs allegation that \n24  Defendants have a practice of failing to provide Medicaid Subclass members with timely \n25  mental health services. \n26  iv.  Timeliness of Well-Child Visits \n27  Finally, Plaintiff alleges Defendants have a practice of failing to provide members \n28  of the Medicaid Subclass with timely well-child visits and immunizations. (Doc. 430 at \n \n- 22 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 23 of 32\n \n \n \n1  15.) Defendants respond that โthe great majority of foster care children get their services \n2  according to the periodicity schedules.โ (Doc. 435 at 11.) \n3  Both  parties  have  provided  statistical  figures  illustrating  what  percentage  of \n4  children in the custody of the Arizona foster care system received the mandated well-\n5  child physical examination in the years 2012 through 2016. An examination of these \n6  statistics supports the conclusion that, in the past, each year approximately one-quarter to \n7  one-third of foster children did not receive their well-child examination. \n8  The AMPM requires that the well-child examination be performed at least one \n9  time  per  year.  Defendants  cite  the  2015-2016  Annual  Report  for  Acute  Care  and \n10  DES/CMDP,  which  calculated  treatment  figures  based  on  a  combination  of \n11  administrative data collected from the automated managed care data system, and data \n12  collected by contractors from medical and/or case management records. (Doc. 435-2 at \n13  79.) For 2012, 63.7% of children ages 3โ6, and 63.8% of adolescents,20 received their \n14  well-care visits. (Id.) Defendantsโ statistics necessarily imply that 36.3% of children ages \n15  3โ6 and 36.2% of adolescents did not receive their well-care visits. For 2013, 71.8% of \n16  children ages 3โ6, and 68.3% of adolescents, received their well-care visits. (Doc. 435-2 \n17  at  79.)  Again,  this  implies  that  in  2013  28.2%  of  children  ages  3โ6  and  31.7%  of \n18  adolescents did not receive such care. The Court finds that 63.7%, 63.8%, 71.8%. or \n19  68.3% is not an โoverwhelming majority.โ (See Doc. 435 at 9.) \n20  Plaintiff cites the expert report of Dr. Steven Blatt, who examined the quarterly \n21  CMDP  EPSDT  Adult  and  performance  Measure  Monitoring  Reports  from  2014โ17. \n22  (Doc. 392-3 at 6โ7.) Dr. Blatt concluded that in 2014, 24%โ29.9% of children ages 3โ6 \n23  and 32.2%โ33.9% of adolescents ages 12โ21 did not receive an annual well-child exam, \n24  depending on the quarter. (Id. at 7.) He concluded that the 2015 figures were 27.3%โ\n25  29.9% for children and 32.5%โ34.1% for adolescents; the 2016 figures were 27.5%โ\n26  29.4% for children and 34.8%โ35.5% for adolescents in Q1, Q3, and Q4 (the Court notes \n27 \n                                              \n20 Defendants do not define the term โadolescents,โ but Plaintiffโs expert Dr. Steven \n28 \nBlatt, citing a similar report, defines โAdolescent Well-Child Visitsโ to include the data \nof children between the ages of 12 and 21. (Doc. 392-3 at 7 n.22.) \n \n- 23 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 24 of 32\n \n \n \n1  that the statistic of 4.1% in Q2 2016 appears to be a typographical error); and the figures \n2  for the first two quarters of 2017 were 26%โ27% for children and 32% for adolescents. \n3  (Id.) The Court notes that these figures change quarterly, and attributes that to the โchurn \n4  in membersโ as some children are reunified or adopted, while other children are enrolled. \n5  (Doc. 238-1 at 128.) \n6  The statistics provided by the parties regarding children who specifically did not \n7  receive well-child visits all fall within the range of 24% to 36.3%. However, the statistics \n8  for EPSDT participation more broadly differ significantly. The Court attributes a portion \n9  of this differential likely to inconsistent definitions. Defendants, who do not define the \n10  term, state that EPSDT participation was 100% in 2012 and 92.6% in 2013; in other \n11  words, 0% of children in 2012 and 7.4% of children in 2013 did not participate. (Doc. \n12  435-2 at 79.) Plaintiffโs expert Dr. Blatt defines the EPSDT Participation Rate as โthe \n13  total number of children in  CMDP who received  at least one  documented initial or \n14  periodic screen during the year, divided by the total number of children who should have \n15  received at least one initial or periodic screen, under the stateโs periodicity schedule.โ \n16  (Doc. 392-3 at 7 n.18.) Dr. Blatt calculated that the โTotal Percent of Children who did \n17  not Participate in EPSDT Well-Child Examsโ was 16.1%โ18.4% in 2014; 17.2%โ19.8% \n18  in 2015; and 22%โ51.7% in 2016. (Id.) \n19  Plaintiffโs expert Dr. Paul Zurek performed an analysis of EPSDT participation \n20  using data only for children who were in foster care between January 1, 2015 and August \n21  18, 2017. (Doc. 392-4 at 4.) That is, all children who were in foster care in 2012-2014, \n22  but were no longer in care on January 1, 2015, were included in Defendantsโ data and Dr. \n23  Blattโs  data  but  not  in  Dr.  Zurekโs  data.  Accordingly,  Dr.  Zurek  had  only  1,345 \n24  observations for 2012, as opposed to 19,472 observations for 2016. (Doc. 392-4 at 26.) \n25  Dr. Zurek found the percentage of mandated EPSDT exams received to be 67.51% in \n26  2012, 68.63% in 2013, 70.09% in 2014, 68.98% in 2015, and 70.81% in 2016. (Id.) This \n27  means that the percentages of children who did not receive EPSDT exams was 32.49% in \n28  2012, 31.37% in 2013, 29.91% in 2014, 31.02% in 2015, and 29.19% in 2016. \n \n- 24 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 25 of 32\n \n \n \n1  The Court finds the statistics provided by both parties to be credible, and attributes \n2  the variations in the figures to the variations in the data sources and methods of analysis. \n3  Defendants  and  Dr.  Blatt  relied  upon  the  regular  reports  produced  by  AHCCCS  in \n4  accordance with 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(43)(D), while Dr. Zurek relied on the raw data \n5  provided by DCS in discovery. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the past, each year \n6  approximately one-quarter to one-third of Medicaid-eligible children in the custody of \n7  Arizonaโs  foster  care  system  did  not  receive  the  EPSDT  well-child  examinations \n8  mandated by the Medicaid Act. In other words, the Court finds sufficient factual support \n9  for purposes of class certification for Plaintiffโs allegation that Defendants have a policy \n10  or practice of failing to provide members of the Medicaid Subclass with timely well-child \n11  visits and immunizations. \n12  In sum, the Court has reviewed the five policies and practices alleged by Plaintiff, \n13  namely failure to provide an adequate array of behavioral health and therapeutic services; \n14  failure to coordinate behavioral health services; ineffective coordination and monitoring \n15  of physical and dental health care; failure to timely provide mental health services; and \n16  failure to timely provide well-child visits and immunizations. In all instances, the Court \n17  finds  sufficient  factual  support  for  the  purposes  of  class  certification  for  Plaintiffโs \n18  allegations these policies and practices create a significant uniform risk that members of \n19  the Medicaid Subclass will not receive necessary physical, dental, and behavioral health \n20  services, in violation of the Medicaid statute.  \n21  B. Significance of risk and imminence of violation \n22  Having found that in the past, approximately one-quarter to one-third of Medicaid-\n23  eligible  children  in  the  custody  of  Arizonaโs  foster  care  system  did  not  receive  the \n24  EPSDT well-child examinations mandated by the Medicaid Act, which constituted a \n25  violation of the Medicaid Act, the Court must determine whether every member of the \n26  Medicaid  Subclass  is  subject  to  an  identical  significant  risk  of  an  imminent  future \n27  Medicaid violation that would support injunctive relief. There is no directly applicable \n28  guidance in the Ninth Circuit as to what level of risk constitutes a significant risk of a \n \n- 25 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 26 of 32\n \n \n \n1  statutory violation, but the Ninth Circuitโs findings in Parsons are instructive.  \n2  The Parsons court noted that every individual in the custody of a state agency โis \n3  necessarily subject to the same  medical,  mental health, and dental care  policies and \n4  practices of [the agency]. And any one of them could easily fall ill, be injured, need to fill \n5  a prescription, require emergency or specialist care, crack a tooth, or require mental \n6  health treatment.โ Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678. Furthermore, the Parsons court found that a \n7  case involving both โuniform statewide practices created and overseen by two individuals \n8  who are charged by law with ultimate responsibility for health careโ and thousands of \n9  individuals โin the custody of a single state agency,โ looking at the question of โwhether \n10  current conditions . . . create a risk of future harm, was a case where โโthe questions of \n11  law are applicable in the same manner to each potential class member.โโ Id. at 681โ682 \n12  (quoting Hughes v. Judd, No. 8:12-CV-568-T-23MAP, 2013 WL 1821077, at *23 (M.D. \n13  Fla. Mar. 27, 2013), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 8:12-CV-568-\n14  T-23MAP, 2013 WL 1810806 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 30, 2013)). \n15  Similar logic applies to โsuits challenging a stateโs provision of social services to \n16  children  in  its  protection.โ  Id.  at  682.  Simply  by  virtue  of  being  in  foster  care,  all \n17  Medicaid Subclass members are subject to the same purportedly deficient practices, and \n18  therefore all Medicaid Subclass members are allegedly exposed to the same risk of harm. \n19  Id. (citing DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1196 (10th Cir. 2010)). The \n20  only real dispute is the magnitude of that risk of harm. \n21  The  Ninth  Circuit  inquired  into  the  imminence  of  harm  when  it  determined \n22  whether  Plaintiff  had  standing  to  bring  a  Medicaid  Act  claim  in  the  first  place, \n23  concluding that she did. Tinsley, 922 F.3d at 973โ74. The Ninth Circuit held that an \n24  allegation โthat the [Defendants] have โa practice of failing to provide members of the \n25  Medicaid Subclass with the screening, diagnostic, and treatment services required under \n26  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Act,โ  . . .  if  true,  would  demonstrate  . . .  โa \n27  sufficient likelihood that [Plaintiff] will again be wronged in a similar way,โ which would \n28  be  redressable  by  an  injunction  ordering  [Defendants]  to  abate  the  policies  and/or \n \n- 26 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 27 of 32\n \n \n \n1  practices that caused the delivery failure.โ Id. at 974 (citing Haro v. Sebelius, 747 F.3d \n2  1099, 1108 (9th Cir. 2014)). The Ninth Circuit further held that at the class certification \n3  stage, a plaintiff can meet their evidentiary burden if the plaintiffโs โallegations are \n4  detailed and supported by additional materials.โ Id. (citing Parsons, 754 F.3d at 683). \n5  In other cases, courts in the Ninth Circuit set the bar for what percentage of a \n6  chance of something occurring constitutes a significant risk to be very low. See generally \n7  Ortiz ex rel. Ortiz v. United States, No. CIV F03-6541 AWISMS, 2007 WL 404899, at \n8  *6 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2007) (โPlaintiff was at significant risk of cerebral palsy, meaning \n9  that there was a 20% chance of cerebral palsy and an 80% chance that Plaintiff was not \n10  going to have cerebral palsy. . .โ); see also Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 712 (9th Cir. \n11  1994) (โAlthough such a slow and painful death will occur in only a comparatively small \n12  percentage of cases, every single hanging involves a significant risk that it will occur.โ). \n13  Plaintiffโs expert Dr. Zurek examined medical records dating back to 7/14/98 for children \n14  who were in foster care from 1/1/15 to 8/18/17, over 19 years of data. (Doc. 392-4 at 20.) \n15  Over that time, 31.52% of children received less than half of the mandated EPSDT \n16  examinations, including 16.26% who did not receive any EPSDT examinations at all. \n17  (Id.) These statistics, and the statistics discussed in Section II.A.iv, supra, are higher than \n18  the percentages courts in the Ninth Circuit have previously held to constitute a significant \n19  risk. \n20  Considering the factual evidence, the caselaw on what constitutes a significant \n21  risk, and the Ninth Circuitโs previous holding in this matter that factual support for the \n22  allegation that Defendants have a โpractice of failing to provide members of the Medicaid \n23  Subclass  with  the  screening,  diagnostic,  and  treatment  services  required  under  the \n24  EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Actโ would demonstrate a likelihood of future harm \n25  that is appropriately redressable by an injunction, Tinsley, 922 F.3d at 974, the Court \n26  finds that the risk that a child in the Medicaid Subclass will not receive timely and \n27  adequate EPSDT services is significant, and that for purposes of class certification there \n28  is a common question whether every member of the Medicaid Subclass is exposed to a \n \n- 27 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 28 of 32\n \n \n \n1  significant risk of an imminent future Medicaid violation. \n2  C. Numerosity and Adequacy \n3    Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff meets the requirements of numerosity and \n4  adequacy of representation. (Doc. 435 at 20.) The Court agrees Plaintiff has satisfied that \n5  burden. (Doc. 363 at 12, 20.) \n6  D. Typicality \n7  Having found commonality, numerosity, and adequacy, the court must analyze \n8  โwhether B.K. is typical of those in the Medicaid Subclassโ and โwhether every other \n9  child had, like B.K., been denied adequate medical care or was subject to an imminent \n10  risk of a statutory violation.โ Tinsley, 922 F.3d at 976 n.4.  \n11  Defendants contend that โthe evidence shows that the Defendants consistently \n12  provided EPSDT services to B.K. when the need arose and nothing suggests she will be \n13  harmed by an imminent Medicaid violation.โ (Doc. 435 at 18โ19.) Defendants argue that \n14  โevery class memberโs claim of inadequate, untimely, or ineffective service would be a \n15  fact-intensive dispute typical of no other class memberโs claim. Plaintiffs thus have not \n16  shown B.K.โs exposure to an identical, class-wide, imminent risk that is typical of other \n17  class members.โ (Doc. 435 at 19.) \n18  The Medicaid Act requires that eligible children receive โSuch other necessary \n19  health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in subsection (a) \n20  to  correct  or  ameliorate  defects  and  physical  and  mental  illnesses  and  conditions \n21  discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the \n22  State plan.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(5). Plaintiff alleges she failed to receive the treatment \n23  necessary to correct or ameliorate a physical condition that had been discovered by the \n24  screening services in a timely manner. Such an allegation, if true, would constitute a \n25  violation of the Medicaid Act. \n26  In June 2013, notes from B.Kโs caseworkers indicate that B.K. was limping. (Doc. \n27  392-2 at 13, 59.) In October 2014, over a year later, B.K.โs therapist noted that B.K.โs \n28  limp had not been addressed. (Id. at 59.) B.K.โs primary care doctor referred her to a \n \n- 28 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 29 of 32\n \n \n \n1  December, 2014 appointment with an orthopedist, but it appears that this appointment did \n2  not take place. (Id.) B.K.โs physical difficulties continued through the summer of 2015, \n3  when another orthopedist appointment was apparently scheduled, though it appears that \n4  appointment did not take place. (Id. at 59โ60.) B.K. did not receive insoles until March, \n5  2016. (Id. at 60.) Even if the first official request for screening services were October \n6  2014, when B.K.โs primary care physician referred her to an orthopedist, rather than June \n7  2013 when the need for healthcare was first identified, the Medicaid Act requires that \n8  B.K. have received treatment no later than April, 2015. Instead, B.K. suffered โdifficulty \n9  walking, pain, and fallsโ for another 11 months until she finally received her insoles. (Id.) \n10  The confidential summary Defendants provided regarding the treatment of B.K.โs feet \n11  confirms she did not receive timely treatment of this condition. (Doc. 437 at 12.) In \n12  addition, Defendantsโ confidential summary of dental health services provided to B.K \n13  establishes she did not receive dental examinations as required under the schedule. (Id. at \n14  10โ11.)  \n15  The  Medicaid  Actโs  requirements  for  EPSDT  services  are  broad,  and  cover \n16  everything  from  the  annual  well-child  visits  discussed  in  Section  II.B.iv,  supra,  to \n17  treatment for a bad foot. The Court has found that in any given year, roughly a quarter to \n18  a third of the Medicaid Subclass does not receive timely and adequate EPSDT services; \n19  and the record supports a finding that Defendants did not โensure timely initiation of \n20  treatment, if required, generally within an outer limit of 6 months after the request for \n21  screening services,โ in violation of 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.56(e), when B.K. did not receive \n22  treatment for her foot problems for over two and a half years. (Doc. 392-2 at 13.) The \n23  record also supports a finding that B.K. did not receive timely dental examinations. (Doc. \n24  437 at 10โ11.) \n25  Accordingly, the Court finds that B.K. is typical of the class. In Parsons, the Ninth \n26  Circuit explicitly rejected arguments in this context about how named plaintiffs may have \n27  in the past suffered varying injuries or how they may currently have different health care \n28  needs. Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686. The Ninth Circuit held Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that \n \n- 29 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 30 of 32\n \n \n \n1  a named plaintiffโs claims be โtypicalโ of the class, not that the named plaintiff be \n2  identically positioned to each other or to every class member. Id. (citing Ellis v. Costco \n3  Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 985 n.9 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding that typicality is not \n4  defeated by different factual scenarios when they result in a claim of the same nature)). \n5  Thus, Plaintiff satisfies typicality, and has exposure to an identical, class-wide, imminent \n6  risk that is typical of other class members. \n7  E. Rule 23(b)(2) \n8  Certification under this rule requires that โthe party opposing the class has acted or \n9  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n10  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ Fed. R. \n11  Civ.  P.  23(b)(2).  Defendant  argues  that  Plaintiff  has  not  identified  a  practice  by \n12  Defendants and shown how it causes denials of medically necessary health care, and \n13  therefore there is no โremediable class-wide Medicaid violation.โ (Doc. 435 at 20.) \n14  As  explored  in  detail  above,  Plaintiff  has  identified  five  practices  which  she \n15  alleges  โcreate  a  significant  uniform  risk  that  Subclass  members  will  not  receive \n16  necessary physical, dental, and behavioral health services, in violation of the Medicaid \n17  statute.โ (Doc. 430 at 15.) \n18  The  Ninth  Circuit,  in  addressing  this  argument  by  Defendants  regarding  the \n19  General Class, dismissed it: \n[Defendants]  next  argue  that  the  district  court  erred  because  the \n20 \nplaintiffs  failed  to  provide  a  specific  injunction  that  could  satisfy Rule \n21  23(b)(2) and Rule  65(d).  This  argument  has  no  basis  in  existing  law, \nwhether in the text of the Federal Rules or in our precedent. Plaintiffs do \n22 \nnot need to specify the precise injunctive relief they will ultimately seek at \n23  the class certification  stage. Instead, as we  have explained before, Rule \n23(b)(2) โordinarily will be satisfied when plaintiffs have described the \n24 \ngeneral contours of an injunction that would provide relief to the whole \n25  class, that is more specific than a bare injunction to follow the law, and that \ncan be given greater substance and specificity at an appropriate stage in the \n26 \nlitigation  through  fact-finding,  negotiations,  and  expert  testimony.โ \n27  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 n.35. . . . A more specific injunction will depend \non further fact-finding and what claims the plaintiffs actually prove through \n28 \nfurther litigation. \n \n- 30 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 31 of 32\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff โseek[s] an injunction on behalf of the Medicaid Subclass to โdevelop and \n2  implement, as soon as practical, a plan to eliminateโ the risk of violation of the Medicaid \n3  statute stemming from Defendantsโ inadequate policies and practices,โ and states that one \n4  aspect of such a plan might be increased hiring of caseworkers. (Doc. 430 at 22, quoting \n5  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 687.) Plaintiff has adequately described the general contours of an \n6  injunction that would provide relief to the whole class. Thus, this requirement is satisfied. \n7  F. Appointment of Counsel \n8  The Court has previously appointed Perkins Coie LLP, Arizona Center for Law in \n9  the Public Interest, and Childrenโs Rights, Inc. as class counsel for the General Class and \n10  the Non-Kinship Subclass. (Doc. 363 at 22.) Class counsel must fairly and adequately \n11  represent the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(4). The Court found in 2017 that \n12  Plaintiffโs counsel satisfied the four requirements under Rule 26(g)(4), and the Court now \n13  finds that Plaintiffโs counselโs diligent litigation over the past two years confirms that \n14  they satisfy the four requirements under Rule 26(g)(4) to represent the Medicaid Subclass \n15  as well. Thus, the Court will appoint Plaintiffโs counsel as counsel for the Medicaid \n16  Subclass. \n17  CONCLUSION \n18    The Court holds for purposes of class certification that there is a common question \n19  whether every member of the Medicaid Subclass is subject to an identical significant risk \n20  of a future Medicaid violation that would support injunctive relief. Because there is no \n21  dispute  as  to  numerosity  or  adequacy,  and  the  Court  holds  B.K.  is  typical,  class \n22  certification is appropriate. \n23    Accordingly,  \n24    IT IS ORDERED Plaintiffโs motion to certify the Medicaid Subclass (Doc. 430) \n25  is GRANTED. The Court certifies the Medicaid Subclass as: All members of the General \n26  Class who are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services \n27  under the federal Medicaid statute. \n28    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED B.K., by her next friend Margaret Tinsley, is \n \n- 31 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 461   Filed 10/11/19   Page 32 of 32\n \n \n \n1  appointed as Class Representative for the Medicaid Subclass. \n2    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Perkins Coie LLP, Arizona Center for Law in the \n3  Public  Interest,  and  Childrenโs  Rights,  Inc.  are  appointed  as  Class  Counsel  for  the \n4  Medicaid Subclass. \n5    Dated this 11th day of October, 2019. \n6   \n7   \n \n8 \nHonorable Roslyn O.

Motion for Class Certification \n2 \nNamed Plaintiff B.K., by her Next Friend and through her attorneys, respectfully \n3 \nmoves the Court for an order pursuant to Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \n4 \nCivil Procedure certifying a subclass of children who are or will be in the legal custody of \n5 \n6  the Arizona Department of Child Safety (โDCSโ) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or \n7 \nneglect and who are entitled to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment \n8 \n(โEPSDTโ) services under the federal Medicaid statute. \n9 \n10  II.  Introduction and Procedural History \n11 \nThis action concerns the policies and practices of DCS and the Arizona Heath \n12 \nCare Cost Containment System (โAHCCCSโ)1 that subject thousands of Arizona children \n13 \n14  in foster care to the denial of medically necessary health care. Defendants have long \n15 \nneglected to address the systemic failures that cause such defects, including inadequate \n16 \naccess to all necessary medical, dental, and behavioral health care services; failure to \n17 \ncoordinate care among the various state agencies and private providers that are required \n18 \n19  to provide necessary care to foster children; inadequate array of therapeutic services; and \n20 \nthe failure to ensure that there are sufficient providers of behavioral health services to \n21 \nmeet the critical needs of foster children. \n22 \n23  In September 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification, \n24 \ncertifying three classes under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2): (1) a general class of children who \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  1 Defendant Gregory McKay is the Director of DCS and defendant Jami Snyder is \nDirector of AHCCCS. Collectively Director McKay and Director Snyder are referenced \n28 \nas โDefendants.โ \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 5 of 24\n \n \n \nare or will be in the legal custody of DCS due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect \n1 \n2 \n(the โGeneral Classโ), (2) a subclass of children in the General Class who are not placed \n3 \nin the care of an adult relative or person who has a significant relationship with the child \n4 \n(the โNon-Kinship Subclassโ), and (3) a subclass comprised of all members of the \n5 \n6  General Class who are entitled to EPSDT services under the federal Medicaid statute (the \n7 \nโMedicaid Subclassโ). (Order, Sept. 29, 2017 (Dkt. No. 363) (โClass Certification \n8 \nOrderโ).) Defendants appealed. \n9 \n10  A Ninth Circuit panel reviewed the grant of class certification and affirmed the \n11 \ncertification of the General Class and the Non-Kinship Subclass, finding that both \n12 \nsatisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2). (Opinion, Apr. 26, 2019 (Dkt. \n13 \nNo. 418) (โNinth Circuit Opinionโ).) However, the panel vacated certification of the \n14 \n15 \nMedicaid Subclass and remanded for further consideration of the commonality \n16 \nrequirement under Rule 23(a). The panel found that the commonality requirement can be \n17 \nsatisfied in this case if there is a โcommon risk of a future violation that flows from the \n18 \n19  same state-wide policy or practiceโ but declined to โsupplant [this Courtโs] discretionโ by \n20 \nmaking a factual finding that every subclass member was subject to such a risk. (Id. at \n21 \n36-37.)2 \n22 \n23    On February 27, 2018, long before issuing its decision on class certification, the \n24 \n                                              \n25  2 Importantly, the panel did not disagree with this Courtโs factual findings. To the \ncontrary, when considering class certification of the General Class, the panel agreed that \n26 \nB.K. had sufficiently demonstrated that she is โsubject to statewide policies and practices \n27  that apply equally to every member of the class.โ (Ninth Circuit Opinion at 23 (holding \nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the named plaintiff \n28 \nwas typical of the General Class).) \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 6 of 24\n \n \n \nNinth Circuit stayed further proceedings in this case in connection with its decision to \n1 \n2 \nhear Defendantsโ interlocutory appeal. (Order, Feb. 27, 2018 (Dkt. No. 412).) In the 14 \n3 \nmonths between Plaintiffsโ original motion for class certification and the staying of \n4 \nfurther proceedings, the parties exchanged additional discovery, including merits expert \n5 \n6  reports. Last month, following its decision on Defendantsโ appeal, the Ninth Circuit lifted \n7 \nthe stay. (Order, June 11, 2019 (Dkt. No. 420).) Plaintiffs thus now bring this motion \n8 \nowing to discovery available as of the day the case was stayed.3  \n9 \n10  This Court should recertify the Medicaid Subclass. DCS and AHCCCS have failed \n11 \nto ensure adequate and timely provision of necessary medical services mandated by the \n12 \nfederal Medicaid statute, creating a significant risk of an imminent future violation of that \n13 \nstatute for youth in the Stateโs foster care system who are eligible for Medicaid. (See \n14 \n15 \nNinth Circuit Opinion at 36.) \n16 \nIII.  Defendantsโ Obligations Under Medicaid \n17 \nApproximately 95% of the children in foster care in Arizona are eligible for \n18 \n19                                                \n3 Much of that discovery was analyzed by Plaintiffsโ experts in their most recent expert \n20 \nreports, which provide further evidence that Defendantsโ practices put the Medicaid \n21  Subclass at risk of being denied required Medicaid services in violation of the statute. \n(See Dkt.

Ludin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1159 \n7 \n(9th Cir. 2007).) EPSDT services include โscreening, medical, vision, dental, and hearing \n8 \nservices as well as other necessary health treatment services.โ (Class Certification Order \n9 \n10  at 17 (citing 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396d(r)(1)-(5); 1396a(a)(43)(C)).) The scope of such services \n11 \nis extremely broad. They include โany medical or remedial services . . . for the maximum \n12 \nreduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of an individual to the best \n13 \npossible functioning level.โ Rosie D. v. Romney, 410 F.Supp.2d 18, 54 (D. Mass. 2006) \n14 \n15 \n(citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(a)(13)). Like all Medicaid services, EPSDT services must be \n16 \nprovided with โreasonable promptness.โ5 In short, the EPSDT provisions of Medicaid \n17 \nrequire that eligible children โget the health care they need when they need it โ the right \n18 \n19  care to the right child at the right time in the right setting,โ which is โthe goal of the \n20 \nEPSDT provision.โ6 \n21 \n22 \n                                              \n23 \n4 (See Dkt.

AHCCCS is \n3 \nresponsible for maintaining a network of behavioral and mental health care providers to \n4 \ntreat Medicaid-eligible foster children as well as maintaining a network of physical and \n5 \n6  dental providers for those children.7 AHCCCS is also responsible for ensuring that \n7 \nchildren are screened for medical needs at appropriate times. And AHCCCS has an \n8 \nโobligation to see that the services are provided when screening reveals that they are \n9 \n10  medically necessary.โ Katie A., 481 F.3d at 1158. \n11 \nDCS, as the state agency that runs Arizonaโs child welfare system, is charged with \n12 \nthe custody and the care of foster children. DCS is required by statute to provide \n13 \ncomprehensive medical and dental services and to determine the most efficient and \n14 \n15 \neffective way to provide medical care and behavioral health treatment to children in \n16 \nfoster care.8 DCS caseworkers are also integral to the process of ensuring that each child \n17 \nreceives necessary health care services. Caseworkers are required to assess a childโs \n18 \n19  physical health and dental needs, and have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that \n20 \nthe children receive the services they need. (Happach Rep. at 21-23.)9 They are \n21 \nresponsible for participating in the development of behavioral health treatment plans and \n22 \n23  monitoring to ensure timely behavioral health services are delivered.

As we show below, these problems result from Defendantsโ failure to \n7 \ncoordinate among various agencies and workers; Defendantsโ failure to maintain an \n8 \nadequate number of service providers, particularly with regard to behavioral health \n9 \n10  services; and overburdened caseworkers who do not have time to attend to the medical \n11 \nneeds of foster children.  \n12 \nThe data confirm that children in foster care do not get the EPSDT services to \n13 \nwhich they are entitled under the Medicaid statute. After conducting an analysis of data \n14 \n15 \nmaintained by DCS, Plaintiffsโ expert Paul Zurek found that many foster children have \n16 \nnot received mandated physical and dental EPSDT examinations. Specifically, more than \n17 \n31% of the children in foster care received 50% or fewer of the EPSDT tests required. \n18 \n19  (Zurek Rep. at 8 & Ex. 4.) In 2016 and 2017, more than one-third of the required EPSDT \n20 \ntests were not provided, and more than 46% of children who entered foster care failed to \n21 \nreceive a well-child examination. (Zurek Supp. at Ex. 2, 10.)10 Paul Zurek also \n22 \n23  determined that many children in foster care experience lengthy delays before receiving \n24 \nnecessary follow-up care identified in EPSDT examinations. (Zurek Rep. at 11-12 & Ex. \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  10 As a part of the screening services required by EPSDT, โ[a]ll infants, children and \nadolescents should receive regular well-child check-ups of their physical and mental \n28 \nhealth, growth, development, and nutritional status.โ EPSDT Guide at 36. \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 10 of 24\n \n \n \n14.) In July 2015, 56% of referrals were not completed after an average of 163 days. (Id.) \n1 \n2 \nPlaintiffsโ expert Dr. Steven Blatt also reviewed Arizonaโs provision of medical \n3 \nand dental care to foster youth and determined that the state failed to provide adequate \n4 \naccess. (See generally Blatt Rep.) The EPSDT requirement covers regular screening \n5 \n6  services designed to identify health and developmental issues as early as possible.11 Yet \n7 \nDr. Blattโs analysis showed that 33% of foster children failed to either receive a required \n8 \nEPSDT exam within 30 days of entering care (for those children who entered care during \n9 \n10  the examination period) or receive an annual well-child exam (for those who were in care \n11 \nduring the entire examination period). (Blatt Rep. at 4.) Furthermore, the evidence \n12 \nindicates that โchildren in foster care did not receive necessary screenings for \n13 \ndevelopmental delays.โ (Id. at 7.) Though EPSDT services cover proper immunizations,12 \n14 \n15 \nDr. Blatt found that for the first two quarters of 2017, less than 30% of eligible two-year-\n16 \nolds received required immunizations. (Blatt Rep. at 9.) Dental care is also among the \n17 \nservices required by EPSDT,13 yet 43% of children in foster care failed to receive a \n18 \n19  required dental exam. (Blatt Rep. at 4.) It is clear that Defendants are โfail[ing] to ensure \n20 \nthat children in foster care receive routine comprehensive medical and dental care as \n21 \nrequired by EPSDT and best practice.โ (Id.) \n22 \n23  Defendants likewise fail to provide children in foster care with the behavioral \n24 \nhealth services required by the Medicaid statute. The EPSDT provision requires periodic \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  11 EPSDT Guide at 4. \n12 EPSDT Guide at 4. \n28 \n13 EPSDT Guide at 13. \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 11 of 24\n \n \n \nmental health screenings for all children enrolled in Medicaid and any treatment or \n1 \n2 \nservice necessary to โcorrect or ameliorateโ mental illnesses and conditions discovered \n3 \nby screening.14 Such treatment for mental health issues may include โhospital and clinic \n4 \nservices, physician services, and services provided by a licensed professional such as a \n5 \n6  psychologist.โ15 Plaintiffsโ expert Marci White reviewed Arizonaโs behavioral and mental \n7 \nhealth provisions to children in foster care and determined that โ[o]n a system-wide basis, \n8 \nchildren are not getting medically necessary services, and Defendants are not keeping \n9 \n10  track of whether children receive those services.โ (White Rep. at 9.)  \n11 \nMs. White concluded that there is an inadequate array of behavioral and mental \n12 \nhealth services for children in foster care, including a lack of therapeutic foster homes. \n13 \n(Id. at 23-25.)16 The inadequate array of services creates barriers to accessing necessary \n14 \n15 \ncare. For example, Ms. White found โdelays in accessing behavioral health services, \n16 \nincluding specialized, trauma based therapy that children in foster care so desperately \n17 \nneed.โ (Id. at 27.) Ms. White characterized the extensive delays in the provision of \n18 \n19  necessary care as โred flags that the behavioral health system in Arizona is highly \n20 \ndysfunctional and does not meet the needs of children in foster care.โ (Id. at 31.) \n21 \nFurthermore, Ms. White found that Defendantsโ failure to coordinate behavioral \n22 \n23 \n                                              \n24 \n14 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(r)(5); EPSDT Guide at 2, 4. \n25  15 EPSDT Guide at 10. \n16 Therapeutic foster homes provide services to children whose โbehavioral health needs \n26 \nare of such a critical nature that in the absence of such services, the child may be placed \n27  in a more restrictive setting, like a hospital, residential treatment center . . . or therapeutic \ngroup home.โ (White Rep. at 23.) Defendants also have a practice of prematurely \n28 \nremoving children from therapeutic foster homes, resulting in further trauma. (Id. at 26.) \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 12 of 24\n \n \n \nhealth services results in children not getting necessary services. (Id. at 33.) She \n1 \n2 \nidentified serious deficiencies in the Child and Family Team (CFT) process, whereby a \n3 \nteam of individuals knowledgeable about the childโs life develop a services plan to \n4 \naddress behavioral needs. (Id.) Ms. White found that the CFT process was hampered by \n5 \n6  insufficient clinical oversight, limited participation of case managers, service plans that \n7 \nare based on services available and not necessary services, and a lack of systematic \n8 \nmonitoring. (Id. at 34.) Even logs maintained by DCS show that there are โsignificant \n9 \n10  gaps in care.โ (Id. at 36.) The logs have frequent entries showing that โservices were \n11 \nunavailable, that necessary coordination was not occurring, and that there were \n12 \nsubstantial delays in receiving services.โ (Id.)  \n13 \nDCSโs overburdened caseworkers further compound these systemic failures. DCS \n14 \n15 \nhas repeatedly acknowledged that its caseworkers are laden with unmanageable \n16 \ncaseloads. (Happach Rep. at 26.) Plaintiffsโ expert Arlene Happach found that Arizonaโs \n17 \nchildren were not receiving adequate quality of care due to inattention to caseload \n18 \n19  standards. (Id. at 27.) Particularly in situations where treatment requires a caseworkerโs \n20 \nconsent, a caseworkerโs inability to participate in the process can create unnecessary \n21 \ndelay. (See White Rep. at 35.) Even a 2016 annual DCS review found that caseworkers \n22 \n23  could not adequately ensure that childrenโs medical needs were met, specifying that \n24 \nโefforts to assess the physical health needs of children were inadequate in a third of the \n25 \ncases and efforts to assess dental health needs were inadequate in 43% of the cases.โ \n26 \n(Happach Rep. at 27.) Plaintiffsโ expert Marci White also found that caseworkersโ \n27 \n28 \nexcessive caseloads are โa significant factor contributing to the failure to provide \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 13 of 24\n \n \n \nnecessary and timely behavioral health services to children in foster care.โ (White Rep. at \n1 \n2 \n39.) These excessive caseloads prevent caseworkers from adequately performing critical \n3 \nroles in obtaining EPSDT services for foster children. \n4 \nIV.  Legal Standard for Class Certification \n5 \n6  To obtain certification, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that: \n \n7 \n(1) their class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;  \n8 \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;  \n9 \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \n10 \ndefenses of the class; and \n11 \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n12  class. \n13  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Upon satisfying these four requirements, the party seeking class \n14 \ncertification must also satisfy one of the sub-sections of Rule 23(b)โin this case, Rule \n15 \n23(b)(2), which requires that โthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n16 \n17  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n18 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]โ A party seeking class \n19 \ncertification must โโaffirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Ruleโthat is, he \n20 \nmust be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common \n21 \n22  questions of law or fact, etc.โโ Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 675 (9th Cir. 2014) \n23 \n(quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011) (emphasis \n24 \nomitted). However, โ[m]erits questions may be considered to the extentโbut only to the \n25 \n26  extentโthat they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class \n27 \ncertification are satisfied.โ Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 133 S. Ct. 1184, \n28 \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 14 of 24\n \n \n \n1195 (2013). Here, substantial evidence demonstrates that plaintiffs are in compliance \n1 \n2  with Rule 23.17 \n3 \n4  V.  The Medicaid Subclass Should Be Recertified \n5 \nA. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Commonality Requirement \n6 \n1.  The Commonality Standard  \n7 \nThe Medicaid Subclass satisfies the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), \n8 \n9  which necessitates that the Subclassโs claims must โdepend upon a common contentionโ \n10 \nwhose resolution โwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each of the claims \n11 \nin one stroke.โ Parsons, 754 F.3d at 675 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); \n12 \n13  see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). In its decision in this case, the Ninth Circuit held that \n14 \ncertification of the Medicaid Subclass would be appropriate upon a showing that the \n15 \nSubclass is subject to policies or practices that allegedly โexpose every child in the \n16 \nsubclass to a significant risk of an imminent future Medicaid violation.โ (Ninth Circuit \n17 \n18 \nOpinion at 36.) The existence of such a policy or practice suffices to demonstrate \n19 \ncommonality because whether the common policy or practice does in fact pose a \n20 \nsignificant risk of an imminent future Medicaid violation is a question whose answer will \n21 \n22  necessarily resolve all the Subclassโs claims in one stroke. (See id. at 36 n.5.)  \n23 \n24 \n                                              \n25  17 In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, the Supreme Court applied โsignificant proofโ as \none way to โbridg[e] the gapโ in proving evidence of systemic discrimination. 131 S.Ct. \n26 \nat 2553. As the Ninth Circuit noted in Parsons, โ[c]ourts have taken different views of \n27  whether Wal-Martโs significant proof standard applies to all class certification decisions \nor only to claims alleging systemic discrimination.โ 754 F.3d at 684 n.29. In any case, \n28 \nPlaintiffs have provided โsignificant proofโ here of compliance with Rule 23. See id. \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 15 of 24\n \n \n \nHere, there is substantial evidence that the Medicaid Subclass is subject to such \n1 \n2 \npractices, including: \n3 \n๏ท  Defendantsโ practice of failing to provide an adequate array of behavioral \n4 \nhealth and therapeutic services for members of the Medicaid Subclass; \n5 \n๏ท  Defendantsโ practice of failing to coordinate behavioral health services for \n6  members of the Medicaid Subclass;  \n7  ๏ท  Defendantsโ practice of failing to provide Medicaid Subclass members with \ntimely mental health services; \n8 \n๏ท  Defendantsโ practice of failing to provide members of the Medicaid \n9 \nSubclass with timely well-child visits and immunizations; and \n10 \n๏ท  Defendantsโ practice of ineffectively coordinating and monitoring physical \n11 \nand dental health care. \n12 \nThese practices create a significant uniform risk that Subclass members will not receive \n13 \nnecessary physical, dental, and behavioral health services, in violation of the Medicaid \n14 \n15  statute. This Court already recognized statewide practices of Defendants that affect the \n16 \nprovision of physical and dental EPSDT services to the Medicaid Subclass, including \n17 \nexcessive DCS caseworker caseloads and ineffective coordination and monitoring of \n18 \nphysical and dental services by DCS. (Class Certification Order at 17.) Furthermore, \n19 \n20  Plaintiffsโ experts have offered considerable evidence that Defendantsโ practices put all \n21 \nMedicaid-eligible foster children at significant risk of being denied necessary physical \n22 \nand dental health care.  \n23 \n24  As illustrated above, Paul Zurek and Dr. Steven Blatt both found that sizeable \n25 \nnumbers of foster children are not receiving mandated EPSDT examinations. (See supra \n26 \n27 \n28 \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 16 of 24\n \n \n \nยง 3.)18 Dr. Blatt concluded that DCS has consistent practices of failing to provide children \n1 \n2 \nwith medical and dental assessments upon entering care, failing to provide regular and \n3 \nroutine preventative care to children in care, and failing to ensure that medical and dental \n4 \nneeds are met throughout childrenโs time in care. (Blatt Rep. at 3.) These practices not \n5 \n6  only create a substantial risk of harm to the Medicaid Subclass, they also put each \n7 \nmember of the Subclass at risk of not receiving appropriate and timely physical and \n8 \ndental care in violation of the EPSDT provision of the Medicaid statute.  \n9 \n10  With respect to behavioral health care, this Court also recognized several practices \n11 \nthat detrimentally affect the provision of mental and behavioral services to children in \n12 \nfoster care, including ineffective coordination of care between DCS and AHCCCS \n13 \ncontractors, AHCCCS contractorsโ incomplete and out-of-date service plans, a shortage \n14 \n15 \nof therapeutic foster care placements and services maintained by AHCCCS and DCS, a \n16 \nshortage of residential treatment center placements maintained by AHCCCS, a shortage \n17 \nof behavioral health providers maintained by AHCCCS, excessive DCS caseworker \n18 \n19  caseloads, and DCSโs overuse of congregate care for children with unmet mental health \n20 \nneeds. (Class Certification Order at 17-18.)  \n21 \nPlaintiffsโ expert Marci White concluded that Defendantsโ failure to ensure \n22 \n23  adequate behavioral health care services for foster children is โsystemicโ and that \n24 \nโ[c]hildren in foster care simply do not get the behavioral health services they need.โ \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n18 As this Court noted, while it is โnot necessary to assess the merits of whether \n27  Defendants violated the Medicaid Act beyond the question of class certification,โ the \nexpert reports โoffer reliability and significant information to show state-wide practices \n28 \nexist.โ (Class Certification Order at 18 n.5.) \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 17 of 24\n \n \n \n(White Rep. at 44.) โDefendants do not maintain the structure and systems essential to \n1 \n2 \nensure that children in foster care receive the services they need when they need them. \n3 \nDefendants do not maintain a sufficient array of behavioral health services for these \n4 \nchildren. Defendants do not coordinate the provision of services.โ (Id.) Such practices \n5 \n6  create a common and significant risk to each member of the Subclass of a future \n7 \nMedicaid violation by failing to ensure the mental and behavioral health care required by \n8 \nthe EPSDT provision. \n9 \n10  B. Named Plaintiff B.K.โs Claims Are Typical \n11 \nUnder Rule 23(a)(3), a plaintiff may represent a class if her โclaims or defensesโ \n12 \nare โtypical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ A named plaintiffโs claims are typical \n13 \nif they are โreasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be \n14 \n15 \nsubstantially identical.โ Parsons, 754 F.3d at 685 (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 \n16 \nF.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998)). \n17 \nB.K. is a 14-year-old girl who has regularly struggled to get access to adequate \n18 \n19  health care, including medically necessary EPSDT services. She suffers from significant \n20 \npsychiatric diagnoses and mental health needs of which Defendants have long been \n21 \naware. (Azzi-Lessing Rep. at 1.) Plaintiffsโ expert Lenette Azzi-Lessing reviewed the \n22 \n23  case file of Named Plaintiff B.K. and determined that Defendants caused harm to her by \n24 \nfailing to provide needed mental, behavioral, and physical health care.  \n25 \nDue to B.K.โs difficult mental health needs, on multiple occasions, caretakers and \n26 \nclinicians recommended that she be placed in a therapeutic foster home, where foster \n27 \n28 \nparents receive additional training and supports to handle particularly troubling \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 18 of 24\n \n \n \nbehaviors. (See Azzi-Lessing Rep. at 11, 13, 18, 39.) Unfortunately, again and again, \n1 \n2 \nsuch placements were not available in a timely manner. (Id.) Ms. Azzi-Lessing concluded \n3 \nthat this failure to provide needed care stemmed from Arizonaโs lack of โan adequate \n4 \narray of placement settings and behavioral health services for children in foster careโ and \n5 \n6  that B.K.โs access to therapeutic programs was โinappropriately restricted.โ (Id. at 40; see \n7 \nalso White Rep. at 43 (noting that as a result of Defendantsโ systemic failures to maintain \n8 \na sufficient array of therapeutic placement alternatives, B.K. did not receive behavioral \n9 \n10  health services at the time she needed them).) B.K. was โplaced in a series of placements \n11 \nthat could not meet her needs,โ and โB.K. disrupted from each one, and each set of \n12 \ndisrupted relationships fueled B.K.โs difficulties in the following placement.โ (Azzi-\n13 \nLessing Rep. at 43.)  \n14 \n15 \nMs. Azzi-Lessing also found that the State repeatedly failed to address B.K.โs \n16 \nmultiple, severe psychiatric disorders. Though at times B.K. received behavioral \n17 \ncoaching, counseling, and other services, โ[t]here is no evidence that these services were \n18 \n19  well coordinated, meaning they were less likely to be effective, and may have, at times, \n20 \nworked at cross purposes.โ (Id. at 42-43.) B.K. also did not receive consistent \n21 \npsychotherapy, and group staff sometimes completely failed to transport her to her \n22 \n23  therapy appointments. (Id. at 53-55.) B.K.โs frequent placement changes exacerbated the \n24 \nissue, such that one therapist expressed concern that she kept โfalling through the \n25 \ncracks.โ (Id. at 55.) One doctor noted the lack of coordination between B.K.โs foster \n26 \nparents, coaches, and her counselor, which he felt hampered the effectiveness of these \n27 \n28 \nservices. (Id. at 54.) Defendantsโ failure to โmaintain a sufficient array of behavioral \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 19 of 24\n \n \n \nhealth servicesโ and โcoordinate the provision of servicesโ resulted in B.K. not receiving \n1 \n2 \nthe behavioral health care she needed. (See White Rep. at 44.)  \n3 \nDefendants also failed to โeffectively manage and coordinate the delivery of \n4 \nphysical . . . health care servicesโ to B.K. (See Blatt Rep. at 2.) For example, it took over \n5 \n6  two and a half years to receive an evaluation by an orthopedist despite a limp, difficulty \n7 \nwalking, pain, and falls. (Azzi-Lessing Rep. at 2, 57.) When she was finally brought to an \n8 \northopedist, B.K. was fitted with orthotic insoles to help her walk correctly. (Id. at 16.)  \n9 \n10  Evidence indicates that B.K.โs injuries stem from policies and practices of \n11 \nDefendants. Every member of the Medicaid Subclass is subject to the same policies and \n12 \npractices that result in delayed or inadequate access to necessary physical, dental, and \n13 \nbehavioral health services. As detailed supra in Section 3, Plaintiffsโ experts Dr. Steven \n14 \n15 \nBlatt and Paul Zurek each found that significant numbers of children in foster care do not \n16 \nreceive necessary EPSDT physical and dental medical care and Plaintiffsโ expert Marci \n17 \nWhite found that Defendants have failed to ensure that children in foster care receive \n18 \n19  necessary mental and behavioral health services. These reports indicate that the practices \n20 \nthat led to failures in care for B.K. broadly reach the Medicaid Subclass as a whole, and \n21 \nsubject each member of the Subclass to the same risk of inadequate and untimely care.19 \n22 \n23                                                \n19 Additionally, the Ninth Circuit found that B.K.โs allegations of Defendantsโ failures to \n24 \nensure adequate physical and mental health care and the medical and placement evidence \n25  in the record were, together, sufficient to support standing. (Ninth Circuit Opinion at 31.) \nThe expanded evidence now in the record and detailed above clearly establishes that B.K. \n26 \nhas experienced significant delays in access to health care, including in obtaining \n27  orthopedic services and appropriate therapeutic treatment. B.K. remains in care, and \ntherefore there is โa sufficient likelihood that [s]he will again be wronged in a similar \n28 \nway.โ See Haro v.

The Medicaid Subclass is clearly sufficiently numerous and the \n8 \nNamed Plaintiff and counsel meet the adequacy of representation standard.  \n9 \nNumerosity is generally satisfied when a proposed class has 40 members. See, \n10 \ne.g., Rannis v. Recchia, 380 F. Appโx 646, 651 (9th Cir. 2010). Based on data made \n11 \n12  available during discovery, there are thousands of children in the Medicaid Subclass.20 \n13 \nThus, plainly, these classes are โso numerous that joinder of all members is \n14 \nimpracticable.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n15 \n16  The adequacy of representation requirement is satisfied where (1) the named \n17 \nplaintiffs and their counsel do not have any conflict of interest with other class members \n18 \nand (2) the named plaintiffs and their counsel will prosecute the action vigorously on \n19 \n20  behalf of the class. Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. B.K. and her counsel โdo not have conflicts \n21 \nof interest with other class members since [B.K.] seek[s] to improve structural \n22 \ndeficiencies that affect children in DCS custody.โ (Class Certification Order at 20); see \n23 \n24 \n                                              \n25  citation omitted). This risk is redressable by an injunction ordering Directors to abate the \npolicies and practices that have caused the inadequate access to health care. See id. at \n26 \n1108-09 (finding that injunctive relief would redress the plaintiffโs injury). \n27  20 (See Dkt. No. 238-1, Ex. 33 at DCS-00121026, CMDP QMPI Strategic Reporting \nCommittee Quarterly Meeting Minutes, August 19, 2014.) \n28 \n \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 21 of 24\n \n \n \nalso Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 378 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding the requirement \n1 \n2 \nsatisfied where plaintiffs sought โbroad based relief which would require the child \n3 \nwelfare system to dramatically improve the quality of all of its servicesโ).21 There can be \n4 \nno doubt that B.K., her counsel, and the Next Friends have already and will continue to \n5 \n6  prosecute this action vigorously on behalf of each class.22 Plaintiffs therefore meet the \n7 \nrequirements of Rule 23(a)(1) and (a)(4). \n8 \n2.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) \n9 \nThis Court previously found that the Medicaid Subclass satisfies Rule 23(b)(2), \n10 \n11  which requires that โthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \n12 \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n13 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ (See Class Certification \n14 \nOrder at 20-21 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).) This requirement is โโunquestionably \n15 \n16 \nsatisfiedโโ when the putative class seeks โuniform injunctive or declaratory relief from \n17 \npolicies or practices that are generally applicable to the class as a whole.โ (Id. at 20 \n18 \n(citing Parsons, 754 F.3d at 688).) The rule will โordinarily be satisfied when plaintiffs \n19 \n20  have described the general contours of an injunction that would provide relief to the \n21 \n                                              \n22 \n21 This Court has already determined that there is no conflict between the Next Friends \n23  and the members of the class. (Dkt. Nos. 156 and 162.)   \n22 The Court has previously appointed Childrenโs Rights, Perkins Coie LLP, and Arizona \n24 \nCenter for Law in the Public Interest as class counsel in this action. (Class Certification \n25  Order at 22.) Plaintiffsโ counsel continue to meet the requirements of Rule 23(g) and should \nbe appointed again to represent the Medicaid Subclass. (See Dkt. No. 235, Declaration of \n26 \nHarry Frischer in Support of Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Nov. 29, 2016; Dkt. \n27  No.  236,  Declaration  of  Joseph  E.  Mais  in  Support  of  Plaintiffsโ  Motion  for  Class \nCertification, Nov. 29, 2016; Dkt. No. 237, Declaration of Anne Ronan in Support of \n28 \nPlaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Nov. 28, 2016.) \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-00185-ROS   Document 430   Filed 07/31/19   Page 22 of 24\n \n \n \nwhole class.โ Parsons at 689 n.35.  \n1 \n2 \nHere, Plaintiffsโ claims โchallenge Defendantsโ common set of policies and \n3 \npractices involving health care services and the placement of children in the foster care \n4 \nsystem.โ (Class Certification Order at 21.) Plaintiffs do not seek individual adjudications \n5 \n6  of each membersโ Medicaid claims, but rather โseek to remedyโ the โโrisk of exposureโ \n7 \ncreated by subjecting children in foster care to [Defendantsโ] policies and practices.โ (Id.) \n8 \nPlaintiffs seek an injunction on behalf of the Medicaid Subclass to โdevelop and \n9 \n10  implement, as soon as practical, a plan to eliminateโ the risk of violation of the Medicaid \n11 \nstatute stemming from Defendantsโ inadequate policies and practices. See Parsons, 754 \n12 \nF.3d at 687 (internal quotations omitted) (holding that the district court did not abuse its \n13 \ndiscretion in determining that plaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(b)(2) where plaintiffs requested \n14 \n15 \nsimilar injunctive relief to reduce a risk of harm and specified issues that any plan should \n16 \nbe required to address). Such classwide injunctive relief may include, among other \n17 \nrequirements, an injunction to hire more caseworkers in order to โmeet health care \n18 \n19  delivery deadlines in a manner that ensures the plaintiffs receive timely medical \n20 \nevaluations and care.โ (Ninth Circuit Opinion at 26.) Thus, Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied.  \n21 \nVI.
