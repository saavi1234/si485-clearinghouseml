Pursuant tb Paragraphs(cid:9) nd 10 of Section 180a of Title\n49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Greyhound is prohibited from and\nafter \nNovember 1, 1961, from maintaining in the terminal, and in other\nterminals throughout Mississippi, any separate facilities for the white\nand Negro races or from displaying in the terminal any sign indicating\nthat any portion of the facilities are separated, allocated, restricted,\nprovided, available, used or otherwise distinguished on the basis of\nrace or color. A violation of these provisions would constitute a\ncriminal offense under I9 U.S.C. 322.\n16. On October 27, 1961, John J. Fraiser, Jr., acting on behalf\nof the State of Mississippi, filed Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court\nof Leflore County for a mandatory injunction to compel compliance by\nGreyhound with the provisions of Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\nOn the same day, Arthur B. Clark, Jr., acting as Judge of the Fourth\nCircuit Court District, ordered the issuance of a writ of injunction in\nCivil Action No. 13283 requiring Greyhound and S. M. Courtney, its agent,\nto maintain on the entrance to one of its waiting rooms in the terminal\na sign reading \"White Waiting Room Intrastate Passengers\" and another\nsign on the entrance of the other waiting room reading \"Colored Waiting\nRoom Intrastate Passengers\" for as long as the waiting room are used by\nintrastate passengers. The writ of injunction further required Grey-\nhound and S. M. Courtney to appear before the Chancery Court of Leflore\nCounty on November 13, 1961, to answer the bill of complaint filed by\nJohn J. Fraiser, Jr. A copy of the writ of injunction is attached\nhereto as an appendix.\n17. The purpose and effect of the writ of injunction referred\nto in the proceding paragraph is to compel Greyhound and S. M. Courtney\nto maintain racially segregated facilities in the terminal and to display\nracial signs in violation of federal law and of the regulations of the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, or in the alternative to abandon the use\nof the terminal for its passengers traveling in interstate commerce.\n-5-\n\n18. Enforcement of the writ of injunction and any further\nprosecution of Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore County\nwill impose an undue and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce\nby moror carrier in and through Greenwood, Mississippi.\n19. In compliance with the order of the Interstate Commerce\nCommission, Greyhound is in the process of removing racial signs from\nits terminal facilities throughout the State of Mississippi. Compliance\nby Greyhound with the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be\nprevented and impeded if the defendants and the classes which they represent\nare permitted to enforce Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\n20. Maintenance of a bus terminal in Greenwood and bus terminals\nelsewhere in Mississippi for the c cl sive use of passengers traveling in\ninterstate commerce and the maintenance of separate terminals for those\ntraveling in intrastate commerce would cause unreasonable expense and\ninconvenience to Greyhound and to its interstate passengers and would\nunduly burden the free flow of interstate commerce.\n21. Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code and the writ of\ninjunction issued in Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore\nCounty on October 27, 1961, are null, void and unconstitutional under\nthe commerce clause of Article 1, Section 8, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution and are in conflict with the provisions of\nU.S.C. 316(d) and 49 C.F.R. 180a.\nLL9 \n22. Unless restrained by order of the Court, John J. Fraiser,\nJr. and Arthur B. Clark, Jr. will prosecute and enforce Action No.\n13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore County, and Greyhound and S. M.\nCourtney will be compelled to comply with the writ of injunction issued\naction \nin that  on October 27, 1961.\n23. The defendants John J. Fraiser, Jr. and the class which he\nrepresents, Parham H. Williams, Jr and the class whiEh'hb represents,\nArthur B. Clark, Jr., Joe T. Patterson and the State of Mississippi will,\n\nunless restrained by order of this court, enforce Section 7787,5 of the\nMississippi Code and will thereby cause immediate and irreparable injury\nto the plaintiffs, consisting of obstruction to and interference with the\nfree flow of interstate commerce and obstruction to and interference with\ncommon carriers in complying with the valid regulations of the Interstate\nCommerce Commission and the statutes of the United States respecting\ninterstate commerce.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that a District Court\nof three judges be convened pursuant to Sections 2281 and 2284 of Title\n28 of the United States Code,. that the Court adjudge and declare Section\n7787.5 of the Mississippi Code to be unconstitutional, null and void as\ncontrary to the provisions of Article 1, Sec. 8, and Article VI of the\nConstitution of the United States and the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution, and that the Court enter an order -\n(a) Enjoining John J.

In discharge of this duty Greyhound\nmaintains in Greenwood a bus terminal (hereinafter referred to as the\nintersection \nterminal) located at the  of Church Street and Main Street\nin Greenwood. Facilities in the terminal include waiting room and\nreception room facilities, rest rooms, eating and drinking facilities\nand ticket sales and baggage handling facilities.\n13. Prior to September 22, 1961, Greyhound maintained in the\nterminal separate facilities for the use of the white and Negro races\nmaintained \nand  signs in the terminal designating which facilities were\nfor the use of each race.\n]1. On September 22, 1961, the Interstate Commerce Commission\nentered its order in a proceeding titled \"Discrimination in Operations\nof Interstate Motor Carriers of Passengers,\" Docket No. MC-C-3358, adding\nSection 180a to Title L9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The\nregulations set forth in Section 180a become effective on November 1,\n1961, and are binding upon Greyhound.\n-It-\n\n15.

A violation of these provisions would constitute a\ncriminal offense under I9 U.S.C. 322.\n16. On October 27, 1961, John J. Fraiser, Jr., acting on behalf\nof the State of Mississippi, filed Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court\nof Leflore County for a mandatory injunction to compel compliance by\nGreyhound with the provisions of Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\nOn the same day, Arthur B.

Compliance\nby Greyhound with the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be\nprevented and impeded if the defendants and the classes which they represent\nare permitted to enforce Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\n20. Maintenance of a bus terminal in Greenwood and bus terminals\nelsewhere in Mississippi for the c cl sive use of passengers traveling in\ninterstate commerce and the maintenance of separate terminals for those\ntraveling in intrastate commerce would cause unreasonable expense and\ninconvenience to Greyhound and to its interstate passengers and would\nunduly burden the free flow of interstate commerce.\n21. Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code and the writ of\ninjunction issued in Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore\nCounty on October 27, 1961, are null, void and unconstitutional under\nthe commerce clause of Article 1, Section 8, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution and are in conflict with the provisions of\nU.S.C. 316(d) and 49 C.F.R. 180a.\nLL9 \n22.

The State of Mississippi is a State of the United States.\nIts principal legislative and executive offices are located in the City\nof Jackson.\n9. Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code provides that in all\npassenger terminals owned, operated, or leased in the State of Missis-\nsippi by a bus company or other carrier of passengers, the owner or\noperator shall maintain a separate waiting or reception room for white\nintrastate passengers and a separate waiting room for colored intrastate\npassengers. The section further requires that the entrance to the white\nwaiting room bear a sign reading \"White Waiting Room, Intrastate\nPassengers,\" and the entrance to the colored waiting room bear a sign\nreading \"Colored Waiting Room, Intrastate Passengers.\" Any bus\ncompany which fails or refuses to comply with these provisions is\nliable in the penal sum of $1,000 per day for each day of such failure\nor refusal, to be recovered by suit filed in the county in which the\nterminal is situated by either the Attorney General of Mississippi, the\nDistrict Attorney of the district or the County Attorney of the county.\nSection 7787.5 further provides that the Attorney General of Mississippi,\nthe District Attorney of the district or the County Attorney of the\ncounty in which the bus terminal is situated may file suit in the\nChancery Court of such county for a mandatory injunction to compel\ncompliance and that the Chancery Court shall have jurisdiction to issue\nan injunction and to hold the bus company in contempt for failing to\ncomply.\n-3-\n\n10. The Greyhound Corporation (hereinafter referred to as\nGreyhound) is a common carrier by motor vehicle within the meaning of\nl9 U.S.C. (a)(]14) engaged in the transportation of passengers in both\ninterstate and intrastate commerce to, from and through Greenwood,\nMississippi. Greyhound holds a certificate of public convenience and\nnecessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing and\nrequiring it to provide such transportation in interstate commerce.\n11. S. M. Courtney is an employee and agent of Greyhound\nresponsible for the supervision and management of the bus terminal.\nHe resides in Mississippi.\n12. Greyhound has a duty under 19 U.S.C. 316(a) to provide\nin \nadequate service, equipment and facilities  connection with the trans-\nportation it provides passengers in interstate commerce to, from and\nthrough Greenwood, Mississippi. In discharge of this duty Greyhound\nmaintains in Greenwood a bus terminal (hereinafter referred to as the\nintersection \nterminal) located at the  of Church Street and Main Street\nin Greenwood. Facilities in the terminal include waiting room and\nreception room facilities, rest rooms, eating and drinking facilities\nand ticket sales and baggage handling facilities.\n13. Prior to September 22, 1961, Greyhound maintained in the\nterminal separate facilities for the use of the white and Negro races\nmaintained \nand  signs in the terminal designating which facilities were\nfor the use of each race.\n]1. On September 22, 1961, the Interstate Commerce Commission\nentered its order in a proceeding titled \"Discrimination in Operations\nof Interstate Motor Carriers of Passengers,\" Docket No. MC-C-3358, adding\nSection 180a to Title L9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The\nregulations set forth in Section 180a become effective on November 1,\n1961, and are binding upon Greyhound.\n-It-\n\n15. Pursuant tb Paragraphs(cid:9) nd 10 of Section 180a of Title\n49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Greyhound is prohibited from and\nafter \nNovember 1, 1961, from maintaining in the terminal, and in other\nterminals throughout Mississippi, any separate facilities for the white\nand Negro races or from displaying in the terminal any sign indicating\nthat any portion of the facilities are separated, allocated, restricted,\nprovided, available, used or otherwise distinguished on the basis of\nrace or color. A violation of these provisions would constitute a\ncriminal offense under I9 U.S.C. 322.\n16. On October 27, 1961, John J. Fraiser, Jr., acting on behalf\nof the State of Mississippi, filed Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court\nof Leflore County for a mandatory injunction to compel compliance by\nGreyhound with the provisions of Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\nOn the same day, Arthur B. Clark, Jr., acting as Judge of the Fourth\nCircuit Court District, ordered the issuance of a writ of injunction in\nCivil Action No. 13283 requiring Greyhound and S. M. Courtney, its agent,\nto maintain on the entrance to one of its waiting rooms in the terminal\na sign reading \"White Waiting Room Intrastate Passengers\" and another\nsign on the entrance of the other waiting room reading \"Colored Waiting\nRoom Intrastate Passengers\" for as long as the waiting room are used by\nintrastate passengers. The writ of injunction further required Grey-\nhound and S. M. Courtney to appear before the Chancery Court of Leflore\nCounty on November 13, 1961, to answer the bill of complaint filed by\nJohn J. Fraiser, Jr. A copy of the writ of injunction is attached\nhereto as an appendix.\n17. The purpose and effect of the writ of injunction referred\nto in the proceding paragraph is to compel Greyhound and S. M. Courtney\nto maintain racially segregated facilities in the terminal and to display\nracial signs in violation of federal law and of the regulations of the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, or in the alternative to abandon the use\nof the terminal for its passengers traveling in interstate commerce.\n-5-\n\n18. Enforcement of the writ of injunction and any further\nprosecution of Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore County\nwill impose an undue and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce\nby moror carrier in and through Greenwood, Mississippi.\n19. In compliance with the order of the Interstate Commerce\nCommission, Greyhound is in the process of removing racial signs from\nits terminal facilities throughout the State of Mississippi. Compliance\nby Greyhound with the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be\nprevented and impeded if the defendants and the classes which they represent\nare permitted to enforce Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code.\n20. Maintenance of a bus terminal in Greenwood and bus terminals\nelsewhere in Mississippi for the c cl sive use of passengers traveling in\ninterstate commerce and the maintenance of separate terminals for those\ntraveling in intrastate commerce would cause unreasonable expense and\ninconvenience to Greyhound and to its interstate passengers and would\nunduly burden the free flow of interstate commerce.\n21. Section 7787.5 of the Mississippi Code and the writ of\ninjunction issued in Action No. 13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore\nCounty on October 27, 1961, are null, void and unconstitutional under\nthe commerce clause of Article 1, Section 8, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution and are in conflict with the provisions of\nU.S.C. 316(d) and 49 C.F.R. 180a.\nLL9 \n22. Unless restrained by order of the Court, John J. Fraiser,\nJr. and Arthur B. Clark, Jr. will prosecute and enforce Action No.\n13283 in the Chancery Court of Leflore County, and Greyhound and S. M.\nCourtney will be compelled to comply with the writ of injunction issued\naction \nin that  on October 27, 1961.\n23. The defendants John J. Fraiser, Jr. and the class which he\nrepresents, Parham H. Williams, Jr and the class whiEh'hb represents,\nArthur B. Clark, Jr., Joe T. Patterson and the State of Mississippi will,\n\nunless restrained by order of this court, enforce Section 7787,5 of the\nMississippi Code and will thereby cause immediate and irreparable injury\nto the plaintiffs, consisting of obstruction to and interference with the\nfree flow of interstate commerce and obstruction to and interference with\ncommon carriers in complying with the valid regulations of the Interstate\nCommerce Commission and the statutes of the United States respecting\ninterstate commerce.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that a District Court\nof three judges be convened pursuant to Sections 2281 and 2284 of Title\n28 of the United States Code,. that the Court adjudge and declare Section\n7787.5 of the Mississippi Code to be unconstitutional, null and void as\ncontrary to the provisions of Article 1, Sec. 8, and Article VI of the\nConstitution of the United States and the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution, and that the Court enter an order -\n(a) Enjoining John J.
