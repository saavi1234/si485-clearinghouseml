CRAIG, Superintendent of\nSchools, Flagler County School\nDistrict, et al.,\nDefendant-Appellant\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court for the\nMiddle District of Florida\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nWhether the district court, based on uncontroverted\nfacts showing racial discrimination by the defendants in\nstudent and faculty assignment, erred in ordering racial\nreporting along with other relief.\n\nSTATEMENT\nThis school desegregation action was commenced\nby the United States on July 10, 1970, pursuant to section\n407 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6 and\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. On August 7,\n1970, a Consent Decree and Order wa.s entered providing a plan\nof desegregation for the Flagler County schools to be imple-\nmented commencing with the 1970-71 school year. On\nSeptember 30, 1971, the defendant school board and superin-\ntendent filed a semi-annual report required by the August 7, 1970\norder but failed to include in the report racial statistics\nof students and faculty at each school and classroom in\nthe district.l / After a series of communications with\nthe attorney for the School Board and the entry of a\nstipulated agreement as to definitions of race for the pur-\npose of racial reporting, the defendants, on December 31,\n1970, filed a report with the court indicating that every\nstudent and faculty member in the Flagler County schools\nwas \"oriental.\"\n11 The Flagler County School District operates three\nschool facilities with a total enrollment of approximately\n1140 students.\n- 2 -\n\nOn February 23, 1971, the United States filed an\nApplication for an Order to Show Cause requesting that\nthe defendants be enjoined from operating segregated class-\nrooms, permitting segregated seating within classrooms,\nand discriminatorily assigning teachers to the Bunnell\nHigh School. The Application also requested that the\ndefendants be required to file a complete report pursuant\nto the August 7, 1970, Consent Decree and Order. A hear-\ning was held on March 18, 1971 and on April 28, 1971 the\nDistrict Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law and the Order from which this appeal was taken. At\nthe March 18 hearing evidence was taken showing, and the\nDistrict Court subsequently found, that the defendants were\noperating racially segregated classrooms at the Flagler\nBeach Elementary School, that students at Flagler Beach\nElementary were assigned to school buses on a racially\nsegregated basis, that in certain classes at Bunnell\nHigh School students were seated in a racially segregated\npattern and that faculty members had been assigned to the\nBunnell High School on a racially discriminatory basis.\nAccordingly, the District Court ordered appropriate relief.\nOn June 2, 1971 the defendants filed a Certificate\nof Compliance which included the racial statistics regarding\nstudents and faculty required in the semi-annual reports\nto the District Court.\n- 3 -\n\nThis appeal was noticed on June 25, 1971, and\nis taken only by the defendant James 0. Craig, superin-\ntendent of the Flagler County School District. The School\nBoard has not appealed the April 28, 1971 order.\nDISCUSSION\nThe transcript of the March 18, 1971, hearing which\nhas been designated by the appellant shows that the find-\niinnggss of the District Court were made on facts in evidence.\nThe facts of racial discrimination by the defendants were\nuncontroverted and are not clearly erroneous.\nThe law requiring maintenance of racial records\nand racial reporting is well settled. United States v.\nJefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.\n1966) affd en bane, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967); United\nStates v. Hinds County School Board, 417 F.2d 852 (5th\nCir. 1969); and Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate\nSchool District, 426 F.2d 1364 (5th Cir. 1970) . The infor-\nmation required by the reporting provision is necessary to\nassess and evaluate the desegregation plan in practice, as\nis demonstrated by the record in this case. Green v. School\nBoard of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968); Swann v.\n- 4 -\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1\n(1971). Accordingly, no error of law appears and an\nopinion in this appeal would have no precedential\nvalue.\nIn N.L.R.B. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\nAmerica, 430 F.2d 966 (5th Cir. 1970) this court estab-\nlished Local Rule 21 which states in part: \"When the\nCourt determines that any one or more of the following\ncircumstances exists and is dispositive of a matter\nsubmitted to the Court for decision: (1) that a judgment\nof the district court is based on findings of fact which\nare not clearly erroneous; ... (4) that no error of law\nappears; and the court also determines that an opinion\nwould have no precedential value, the judgment or order\nmay be affirmed or enforced without opinion.\" The\ninstant appeal presents a situation which is appropriate\nfor disposition under this rule.\n- 5 -\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the\ndistrict court should be summarily affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN L.

Craig, superin-\ntendent of the Flagler County School District. The School\nBoard has not appealed the April 28, 1971 order.\nDISCUSSION\nThe transcript of the March 18, 1971, hearing which\nhas been designated by the appellant shows that the find-\niinnggss of the District Court were made on facts in evidence.\nThe facts of racial discrimination by the defendants were\nuncontroverted and are not clearly erroneous.\nThe law requiring maintenance of racial records\nand racial reporting is well settled. United States v.\nJefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.\n1966) affd en bane, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967); United\nStates v. Hinds County School Board, 417 F.2d 852 (5th\nCir. 1969); and Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate\nSchool District, 426 F.2d 1364 (5th Cir. 1970) . The infor-\nmation required by the reporting provision is necessary to\nassess and evaluate the desegregation plan in practice, as\nis demonstrated by the record in this case. Green v. School\nBoard of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968); Swann v.\n- 4 -\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1\n(1971). Accordingly, no error of law appears and an\nopinion in this appeal would have no precedential\nvalue.\nIn N.L.R.B. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\nAmerica, 430 F.2d 966 (5th Cir. 1970) this court estab-\nlished Local Rule 21 which states in part: \"When the\nCourt determines that any one or more of the following\ncircumstances exists and is dispositive of a matter\nsubmitted to the Court for decision: (1) that a judgment\nof the district court is based on findings of fact which\nare not clearly erroneous; ... (4) that no error of law\nappears; and the court also determines that an opinion\nwould have no precedential value, the judgment or order\nmay be affirmed or enforced without opinion.\" The\ninstant appeal presents a situation which is appropriate\nfor disposition under this rule.\n- 5 -\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the\ndistrict court should be summarily affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN L.

Appellant’s other argument, that he does not know how \nThe  School  Superintendent,  who  was  named  as  a  to  implement  the  District  Court’s  mandate  that \nparty-defendant in the suit below as a matter of form,  discrimination in the system be rooted out completely by \nappeals singly pro se from the District Court’s order.  use of non-discriminatory assignment of students (as the \n His  argument  is  that  he  cannot  enforce  the  District  Trial Court suggests, on the basis of alphabetical order) is \nCourt’s order because it contains no definition of what is  without any redeeming merit. \na Negro and therefore, he contends, the order is vague and    \nuncertain.
