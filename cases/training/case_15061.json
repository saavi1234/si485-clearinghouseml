    "summary": "<p>On May 28, 1982, a group of residents of the St. Louis State School and Hospital (hereinafter \"State School\" or \"Bellefontaine\") filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Governor of Missouri and other state officials. They sought to bring the case on behalf of the class of all persons with mental disabilities in Missouri. The Parents Association of the St. Louis State School and Hospital (hereinafter \"Parents Association\"), a non-profit organization made up of relatives of some residents of the State School, were named as co-plaintiffs. The State School was a state-owned residential facility for persons with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and state law as a result of substandard care and conditions at the State School. As a result, the plaintiffs sought attorneys' fees alongside injunctive and declaratory relief, specifically in the form of improved health and sanitation services; protection from abuse; more adequate care and treatment; and a freeze on staffing and budget cuts. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought to stop Missouri from transferring persons with mental disabilities to smaller-scale residences as part of the state's broader deinstitutionalization plan as an alternative to institutions such as the State School. The case was assigned to Judge Edward Filippine.</p><p>On November 9, 1982, the Acting Chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Arthur Peabody wrote a justification memo to Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division William Bradley Reynolds. In the memo, Peabody advocated to intervene in this case on the basis of supporting the finding that there were constitutional violations but opposing the proposed remedy of stopping Missouri's plan of deinstitutionalization. On November 23, 1982, Assistant Attorney General Reynolds declined to intervene, citing that the plaintiffs in the present case already were litigating the constitutional violations and had adequate legal representation and thus reasoning that the limited resources of the Special Litigation Section to other cases.</p><p>We do not have a docket for this case or other complete records, so our account is necessarily incomplete.  At some point, Judge Filippine issued a preliminary injunction regarding specialized therapies for residents of the State School.</p><p>On or before February 18, 1986, Judge Filippine certified the class. On February 18, 1986, Judge Filippine further ordered that the defendants provide notice of the class and settlement to past and present residents of the State School, that had been renamed to Bellefontaine Habilitation Center.</p><p>On May 23, 1986, the parties reached a settlement and submitted a consent decree for the judge's approval. In the consent decree, the defendants agreed to provide more training for staff; permit guardians of residents to review standards of care and treatment; maintain adequate levels of sanitation and safety; adopt a more stringent relocation procedure; and to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.</p><p>Presumably the court adopted this consent decree. It was scheduled to last at least three years from its approval: \"a minimum of three years and for so long as necessary to ensure that the terms of the decree are being fully implemented.\"  We have no information on how long the term was, in the event. </p><p></p>",

The  specific  issue  here  is  the \nsufficiency  of  the  notice  of  the  settlement  to  the  plaintiff \nclass.  The  parties  have  agreed  that  the  attached notice  is \nappropriate.  Defendants  maintain  a  mailing  list of  the  best \ninformant  (client,  guardian,  parent or  relative)  for  persons \nresiding  in  the  Bellefontaine Habilitation Center.  Similar \ninformation  for  class  members  who  are no  longer  residents  is \navailable  through  the  St.  Louis  Regional  Center.  The  parties \nfurther  agree  that mailing  the notice  to  the  persons  named  in \nthese  lists and  posting  the notice  in  the  Bellefontaine \nHabilitation  Center would  sufficiently  inform  the plaintiff class \nof  the  settlement  and  how  to make  any  objections members  of  the \nclass might  have.  The  Court  finds  that the  attached  notice and \nthe method  of  contacting  class members  are  appropriate. \n\nAccordingly, \nIT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that defendants  shall  ensure  that \non  or  before  February  28,  1986,  the  attached  notice  be  sent  by \nUnited  States mail,  first class,  postage pre-paid,  to  persons \nnamed  in  the  lists maintained  by  the  Bellefontaine Habilitation \nCenter  and  the  St.  Louis  Regional  Center. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  in  addition  the  attached \nnotice be  conspicuously  posted at the Bellefontaine Habilitation \nCenter  for  the period  beginning  on  or  before  February  28,  1986, \nthrough  April  7,  1986. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that defendants  shall  inform  the \nCourt  on  or  before March  7,  1986,  of  the  efforts made  to  comply \nwith  this  order. \nDated  this  I~ .vL  day  of  _j..=.c..~..;~_;;,._..;:r.. ._--bo---'  19 86. \n2 \n\n,..___., \nF  I L  E D \nUNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT \nEASTERN  DISTRICT  OF  MISSOURI,  EASTERN  DIVISION  ~ \nFEB 18  1986 \nPARENTS  ASSOCIATION  OF  THE  ) \nEYVON  MENDENHALL \nST.

Please  read  it carefully  if you  or  a  family  member \nare  or  have  been  a  resident  of  the  Bellefontaine Habilitation \nCenter,  10695  Bellefontaine Road,  St.  Louis,  Missouri  63137,  at \nany  time  subsequent  to May  28,  1982. \nPurpose  of  This  Notice \nAfter  three years  of  litigation,  a  final  settlement agree \nment  has  been  reached  in  this  case.  This  notice  is  to  inform \nyou  of  the  settlement,  tell you  how  to  obtain  more  information, \nand  explain  how  you may  object  to  the  settlement  if you  disagree \nwith  it.  A hearing may  be  held  by  the  United  States District \nCourt  to  consider  objections  to  the  settlement. \nBackground \nThis  lawsuit was  filed  in May,  1982,  in  federal  District \nCourt  in  St.  Louis.  It was  filed  by  clients  of  the  Belle \nfontaine  Habilitation  Center  (then  known  as  the St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and  Hospital),  as well  as  the  Parents  Association  of  the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital,  a  nonprofit  organization  of \nguardians,  parents,  and  other  relatives  of  Bellefontaine  cli \nents. \nThe  class  action  lawsuit  sought  improved  conditions  at the \nhabilitation  center.  The  suit does  not  involve  any  claims  for \nmoney  damages. \nSince  the  suit was  filed,  the parties  have  been  engaged  in \npretrial discovery,  a  process  in  which  each  party  obtains  infor \nmation  from  the  other.  In  August,  1984,  the  federal  court  held \na  hearing  on  the  plaintiffs'  request  for  emergency  relief  in \ncertain  areas.  The  Court granted  part of  that motion,  requiring \nthe  defendants  to provide  expanded  physical  therapy  and  occupa \ntional  therapy  services  at Bellefontaine.  The  parties  completed \nsettlement negotiations  in  October  and  filed  the  proposed  settle \nment  with  the  federal  court  on  October  29,  1985. \n\n\"-....../  ....____ \nPlaintiffs \nThe  named  plaintiffs who  filed  the  lawsuit  represent  a \nclass  of  people.  This  notice  is  particularly directed  to  the \nmembers  of  that  class,  which  consists  of:  (1)  all persons  who \ncurrently are  clients  of  the  Bellefontaine Habilitation  Center; \n(2)  all persons  who,  although  not  currently  residing  at Belle \nfontaine  Habilitation  Center,  were  clients  there  at any  time \nsubsequent  to May  28,  1982,  when  the  lawsuit  was  filed;  and  (3) \nall persons  who  become  clients at Bellefontaine  during  the  time \nthat  any  judgment  or  settlement  is  in  force  and  subject  to  the \nfederal  court's  jurisdiction. \nSummary  of  the  Settlement \nIn  summary,  the parties'  proposed  settlement  provides  as \nfollows: \n(1)  The  defendants  are  committed  to operating  the Belle \nfontaine  Habilitation  Center  in  accordance with  professionally \naccepted  standards.  These  include  the  use  of  individualized \ntreatment  plans  that are  tailored  to  the  specific needs  of  indi \nvidual  clients,  as  well  as  the provision  of  high  quality medical \nand  dental  care  to  all  clients.  The  defendants  are also  com \nmitted  to maintaining  certain minimum  levels  of  staffing,  as \nprescribed  in  federal  regulations  for  the  treatment  of  mentally \nretarded  persons. \n(2)  The  defendants  are  committed  to  take  various measures \nto minimize  the  use  of  potent psychiatric medications  and  physi \ncal  restraint devices.  In  accordance  with  clients'  individual \nized  treatment  plans,  the  def endants  are required  to make  good \nfaith  efforts  to  provide  all  training  programs  and  specialized \ntherapies  that  clients  need. \n(3)  The  defendants  are  committed  to protecting  the  physical \nsafety of  Bellefontaine  clients  by  taking  various  measures  to \nminimize  the  risks  that  clients will  injure  themselves  or  oth \ners,  that  clients will  be  injured  or  neglected  by  staff,  or  that \nclients will  be  subject  to  traffic and  other  hazards  near  the \nBellefontaine grounds.  In  addition,  the defendants  will  in \ncrease  the  fire  safety  of  Bellefontaine's group  home  residences \nby  installing  sprinkler  systems  and making  other  renovations. \n(4)  The  defendants  are  committed  to  recommending  community \nplacement  for  a  Bellefontaine client only  when,  in  the  judgment \nof  qualified professionals,  the new  placement  would  be  more \nappropriate  for  the  client  than  Bellefontaine.  The  settlement \nprovides  for  the  consensual  placement  of  a  client  in  a  community \nfacility on  a  trial basis  to  determine  if  the  placement will \nwork. \nFor  Further  Information \nThis  is  a  summary  of  the  settlement.

In light of\nyour comments, it is apparent that there is a need for further\nclarification.\nFirst, my sense is that perhaps you have overreacted in\nyour characterization of my earlier memorandum. The position\ndsreatmafotircthdethpearreturine hfarormdlyproeuvtioliunses paol\"inceyw.\" policy, or even a\nAs I am sure you appreciate, the Division unfortunately\nhas limited resources, and only a percentage of those resources\nare available for enforcement of CRIPA.

The third\np#l#ai#nt#iffsishalveeftadfoerquainteterrveepnretisoenntaintiopnr,ivabtuet wlahwerseuiwtse hwehelireeve\nthe Department can nonetheless make a meaningful, non-duplicative\ncontribution. This last option would likely be sparingly\nexercised.\n\n628\nTo suggest that this approach siqnals a \"drastic change\"\nfrom the past is suspiciously misleading. Prior to passage of\nCRIPA, the intervention policy was materially the same as today.\nWith the new statute, the initiation of our own S. 10 investigations\nhas from the outset assumed the premier spot. But the Division\nhas continued to intervene in private litigation as warranted\nbased on the legal issues involved and the adequacy of the\nrepresentation by retained counsel. That policy has not even\nundergone minor alteration during my tenure.\nAs for the St. Louis case, it clearly falls into the\n\"third priority\" class. The Special Litigation Section currently\nhas a number of active S. 10 investigations. There are in\naddition cases that are presently in litigation. Many new\nmatters are under consideration for possible action. In these\ncircumstances, I am reluctant to enter an ongoing case as\nintervenor where our contribution will be marginal, at best.\nCounsel for plaintiffs is highly competent and there is no\nsuggestion that funding problems exist that might impede effective\nprosecution.\nwith theWhpiloesityioounr mesepmooursaenddumonsubgegheasltfsofsompela#int#iffs#redgisaargdrineegment\ncommunity placement, that hardly suggests a reason to intervene.\nTo my knowledge, plaintiffs have given no indication that they\nare dissatisfied with their counsels' arguments, or that they\nhaaadrrvvoeagncaaendcdeifofnfeorrtehnethtirevibUeenwihteaodlnf.cSotmaIttmeusnisit,ytoinpinlatmecreyvmevenienewt, othntahneplthaheieinghtoitnfefso'bfeing\nbehalf to argue at cross-purposes on the pretense that we\nsomehow know better than they what is best for them.

Co\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Attorney\nCivil Rights Division Special Litigation Section\nFollowing our mecting of January 25, 1983, which was held\nat my request, you requested a brief memorandum that concisely\nsets forth our objections to Mr. Reynolds' memorandum and\ndetermination dated November 23, 1982, in the above case.\nThat memorandum sets forth a new policy for this Section: that\nwe are not to propose interventions in any cases pursuant to\nour authority under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPrfeoeprrsreotsnhesenteAfdoc\"ltl,owb4iy.n2gJ.coSure.naCss.eoln.1s.9.97Wce, stwrhoennglpylaoinbtjeifcfts toarethi\"sadeneqwuapteolylicy,\nnot jul.stifTiehdis nbeywthpeolipcayssargepereosfenCtsRIPAa.draOsvetirc thcheanpgaestthtwaetlvies\nyaseaprsa,rtytopdlaatien,tiwffe ohravelitiigntaetrvinengedamiincusn,umeinrovuoslvicnagsest,heeither\nrights of institutionalized persons. Our efforts, in terms\nof bringing the resources of the federal government to bear\nto remedy unconstitutional conditions in institutions,\nhave been quite successful in these cases. Many of these\naccomplishments could not have been achieved were it not for\nour involvement. Your sole explanation for this change in\npolicy is the passage of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPtherissonnsewApcot.licyHocwoenvsetri,tuftaers fraonm abbedinicgatiroenquiorefdoubryrethsaptonAsctib,ili\nties under CRIPA. The plain language of the Act specifically\nauthorizes interventions by the United States; indeed, the\nprocedural requirements imposed upon us by Congress for inter\nventions are substantially less than for de novo suits.\n#Co#n#fe#rence42 UR.eSp.orc.t o1n997tbhewAitcht isdp.,ec1if9ic9a7lc.lyAndodtietdionwailtlhy,aptphreoval\nthe 25 suits in which we had intervened prior to the enactment\nof CRIPA. In these cases, the Conference Report stated, \"the\nJustice Department invariably has brought to the litigation\nprocess investigative resources, technical advice, and legal\nexpertise unavailable to private litigants. Courts have been\nopenly appreciative of these efforts.\" Conf. Rep. No. 96-897,\n96th Cong., 2d sess. 8, 9 (1980). Moreover, the legislative\n\n626\nhistory specifically indicates that the intervention authority\nin CRIPA merely \"codifies the authority which the Attorney\nGeneral has been exercising since 1971.\" Id. at lºs. To cease\nthe activities that Congress provided us specific authority\nto continue flies in the face of the purposes of CRIPA.\n2. The new policy is particularly unwise in cases in\nwhehriech. TpAlsainMtri.ffsReynhoalvdes\"Tmmeismfroaramndeudmtherirecoarggnuimzeesn,ts,a asstatteºeTyIehgaivsela\nture is well within its authority to require habilitation and\nplacement of mentally retarded people in lesser restrictive\nspeasttsiendgsjusthtansucinhstaitsuttaiotuntse.. TThheeseMisresqouuirreimleengtisslataurerecohnassistent\nwith those we have supported in numerous cases to date, including\ncases in which such pleadings have specifically been approved\nby Mr. Reynolds. However, plaintiffs here, represented\nby attorney Joel Klein, who is adversary counsel in several\nof our cases, plead in their complaint that state officials\nshould not be permitted, in the exercise of their professional\njudgments, to place mentally retarded people in community\nsettings since such placements are inherently inferior to\ninstitutions; according to plaintiffs' counsel, any attempt\nby state officials to exercise their professional judgments\nin this manner is unconstitutional. We do not understand how\nplaintiffs represented by counsel filing such specious pleadings\ncan be considered \"adequately represented.\" Moreover, we can\nbring a needed balance to the presentation of this case to\nthe court. The lawsuit is unique and important, and may\nreceive some notoriety as a result. We have a definite interest\nin seeing that the law in this area is developed properly.\n3. The Special Litigation Section has adequate resources to\nundertake this Iitigation.TThe Chief of specia TLitigation, Tin\nrecommending approval of this intervention, judged that this\nSection has adequate resources to undertake this litigation.\nCertainly the lawyers in this Section are busy pursuing CRIPA\ninvestigations. However, no one is too busy to undertake an\nadditional case. Moreover, one of the reasons attorneys get\ndiscouraged and leave is the absence of in-court litigation\nexperience. In addition, it would be good experience for some\nof the several new lawyers coming on board shortly to have some\nlive cases to work on in order to give them the experience of\nuwnidllertparkeinclgudedistchoivse,rya,ndexmaamyinriensgultwitinnesthsees,neeatrc.elimYoinuartinoenw policy\nof litigation for the Section, at least for the short term.\nSince you have specifically requested that we keep this\nmemorandum succinct, we have not gone into detail regarding\nany of the above points, but would be pleased to do so at a\nmeeting with you and Mr. Reynolds.",

Civ.  P.  23(e)  without  trial,  adjudication,  or the  admission by \nany  party of  any  allegation or claim made  in this action. \n2.  Full  implementation of this agreement may  depend  upon \nfuture  legislative appropriations.  To  the maximum  extent \npossible with all resources  available to them,  defendants  shall \ncomply  with the  Decree.  Where  necessary,  defendants  agree  that \nthey  shall,  in good  faith,  attempt  to persuade the State \nlegislature to provide  such additional  appropriations  as may  be \nnecessary  to put  into effect all components  of  this Decree. \nHowever,  if any  component  of this  Decree  is not put  into effect \ndue  to the unavailability of necessary  funds,  the defendants \ncannot be  found  to be  in violation of  this  Decree  if they are \nproceeding as  outlined  in this paragraph. \n- 1  -\n\n3.  The  term  \"guardian\"  as  used  in this Consent  Decree \nmeans  legal  guardian  or the parent  of  a  client at the \nBellefontaine Habilitation Center  (Bellefontaine)  under the age \nof  18. \n4.  Various  provisions  of this Decree  prescribe  rights \nthat may  be  invoked  or exercised within  specified periods  of \ntime.  For  example,  paragraph  13  (B)  provides  a  twenty-day period \nduring which  a  parent or other  interested family member  of a \nBellefontaine client for whom  a  community  placement has  been \nrecommended  may  initiate procedures  for  appointment  as  a \nguardian.  Paragraph  15  (B)  prescribes a  fourteen-day  period,  in \nthe  course  of  a  trial visit to  a  community  facility,  when  consent \nfor  such a  placement may  be  withdrawn.  In  the  event  that the \nlast day  of these and  similar time  periods  set forth herein  falls \non  a  weekend  or a  holiday,  the  right  involved may  be  timely \ninvoked  or exercised on  the  next  business  day  following  such \ndate. \nICF/MR  Status \n5.  Bellefontaine  is certified under the Medicaid program \nas  an  \"intermediate care  facility  for  the mentally  retarded\" \n(ICF/MR).  Pursuant  to this certification,  the  state of Missouri \nhas  received millions  of dollars  in  federal  assistance  on  behalf \nof Medicaid-eligible clients at Bellefontaine.  So  long  as \nMissouri participates  in the Medicaid  program  for  ICF/MR \nfacilities,  defendants  agree that they  shall  attempt  in good \n- 2  -\n\n-\nfaith to maintain  ICF/MR  certification for  all buildings, \nservices and  programs  at Bellefontaine that are currently \ncertified under  the  ICF/MR  program  and,  further,  that they shall \ncontinue to make  a  good  faith  effort to obtain  ICF/MR \ncertification for  all group  homes  and  other utilized residential \nfacilities not  currently part of  Bellefontaine's Medicaid \nprovider agreement.  In the  event Missouri  withdraws  from  the \nMedicaid program  for  ICF/MR  facilities,  defendants  agree that \nthey shall make  a  good  faith effort to achieve  accreditation \nunder  the  standards  set forth  by  the Accreditation Counsel  for \nthe Mentally Retarded  and  Developmentally  Disabled  (ACMRDD) . \nHabilitation \n6.  Defendants  shall continue  their current policy of \nproviding treatment  and  habilitation services to Bellefontaine \nclients based  on  an  individualized plan  of care designed  in \naccordance with  recognized  standards by  an  interdisciplinary team \nof qualified mental  retardation professionals.  These  plans  shall \nbe  reviewed  on  a  regular basis and,  at least annually,  parents \nand  legal  guardians  of  Bellefontaine clients shall be  strongly \nencouraged  to participate meaningfully  in the  review process.  As \nappropriate,  individualized treatment plans  shall be modified  to \nreflect clients'  changing  needs  and  their progress,  or lack \nthereof,  with  respect to  identified treatment  objectives. \nDefendants  shall make  a  good  faith  effort to provide the \ntherapies,  treatment,  training and  services deemed  appropriate \n- 3  -\n\nfor  each Bellefontaine client in accordance with hisjher \nindividualized plan. \n7.  Defendants  shall make  a  good  faith  effort to provide \nsufficient pre-service and  in-service training to Developmental \nAssistants  and  other direct care staff assigned to client \nresidences,  including  regular  instruction with  respect  to the \nhabilitation programs  and  objectives  for  the  clients under their \ncare,  to assure that such  staff will  be  able  to  intervene \neffectively when  clients exhibit maladaptive behavior,  and  to \ninteract with  clients  in a  manner  consistent with their \nprogramming  objectives  and  strategies.  Defendants  shall maintain \nan  average  annual  ratio of direct-care staff to clients at a \nlevel  no  lower than  that presently prescribed by  federal  ICF/MR \nregulations.  This  last commitment  shall  apply  irrespective of \nwhether Missouri  andjor  Bellefontaine ceases  to participate  in \nthe Medicaid  provider program  for  ICF/MR  facilities.  In \naddition,  defendants  shall  continue  to provide  Bellefontaine \nclients with  clothing that  is clean,  neat and  seasonable, \nspecifically including coats andjor  other outergarments providing \nadequate protection  from  cold during winter months. \n8.  Defendants  agree  that they  shall  continue  to adhere \nto their policy of not using psychotropic  and  other behavior \nmodifying  drugs  as a  substitute for behavior programming. \nDefendants  will  continue their efforts to  reduce  the  levels of \npsychotropic medication  in use  at Bellefontaine.  Defendants \nshall comply with applicable  Department of  Mental  Health \n- 4  -\n\nregulations  pertaining to psychotropic drug use.  In addition, \nand whether  or not prescribed  by  such  regulations,  defendants \nagree  that all proposed  uses  of psychotropic medications,  other \nthan  for  short-term use  on  an  emergency  basis,  shall be  reviewed \nand  approved,  prior to  implementation,  by  the client's parent  or \nguardian,  and by  an  independent panel  consisting of  Bellefontaine \nstaff other than those who  proposed  the use  of psychotropic \nmedication under  review. \nSpecialized Therapies \n9.  Defendants  and  plaintiffs agree  to  incorporate herein \nthe terms  of the  existing preliminary  injunction,  and  defendants' \nplan  for the  implementation  of  such  injunction,  governing \noccupational  therapy  (OT)  and  physical therapy  (PT)  services at \nBellefontaine.  The  reporting  requirements  of that preliminary \ninjunction shall be  continued  for  three years  from  the date  of \nthis Consent  Decree. \nMedical  Care \n10.  Defendants  will  continue to provide high-quality \nmedical  and  dental  care to every  Bellefontaine client. \nDefendants  shall use  their best  efforts,  including the provision \nof  adequate  staff traini ng,  to mi nimi ze  the  risk of err ors  in the \nadministration of medication to clients.  Except  in emergencies, \ndefendants  shall  consult with,  and  obtain the  consent of, \nclients'  parents  or guardians  in  advance  of providing medical \n- 5  -\n\ntreatment  (other than  routine  care)  to clients at Bellefontaine, \nand  in advance  of  initiating any material  change to a  client's \nmedical  treatment,  including material  changes  in medications  or \nmedication  levels. \nPhysical  Restraints \n11.  Defendants  shall  continue to adhere  to their policy \nof not using physical  restraints or time-out  procedures  as a \nsubstitute  for  appropriate  programming  or  for  the convenience  of \nBellefontaine staff.  Except  in emergencies,  physical  restraints \nand  time-out procedures  shall be  used  only  pursuant  to a  plan of \ncare developed by  the client's interdisciplinary team. \nDefendants  shall  comply with applicable Department  of Mental \nHealth regulations pertaining to physical  restraints and  time-out \nprocedures.  In addition,  and  whether  or not prescribed by  such \nregulations,  all plans  of  care  involving the use  of physical \nrestraints andjor time-out procedures  shall be  reviewed  and \napproved,  prior to  implementation,  by  the  client's parent or \nguardian,  and  by  an  independent  panel  consisting  of \nBellefontaine staff other than  those who  proposed  the use of \nphysical  restraints  andjor time-out procedures  under  review.  As \nused herein,  \"physical  restraint\"  means  any  physical \nintervention,  mechanical  device  or mechanical  restraint used  to \nrestrict the movement  of  a  client or the movement  or normal \nfunction  of  a  portion of  the client's body.  As  used  herein, \n\"time-out\"  is a  behavior modifying  procedure  involving  a \n- 6  -\n\nsignificant exclusion or  removal  of  a  client from  any  positive \nreinforcement  so  as  to  induce  a  discontinuation of undesired \nbehavior.  \"Time-out\"  would  include  any  form  of  seclusion. \nCommunity  Placement \n12.  Defendants  agree  that no  Bellefontaine resident will \nbe  recommended  for  placement  in any  other  facility unless  it has \nbeen determined  by  the  resident's  interdisciplinary team  that \nsuch  a  placement would  be more  appropriate  for  the  client.  The \nteam  shall  take  into account  the  safety of the  resident,  among \nother  factors,  as  a  significant consideration  in determining  the \nappropriateness  of  a  placement.  In making  this  judgment,  the \nteam  shall continue  to give weight  to  the  views  of the  resident \nand  his  parents,  guardians  or other  involved  family  members. \n13.  After  a  recommendation  of  placement  has  been made, \nthe  placement  shall be  implemented  in accordance with  the \nfollowing: \nA.  In  the  case  of  a  client with  a  guardian,  the  placement \nmay  occur  upon  receipt of  the  written consent of the guardian or \nafter the  objection of  the  guardian has  been overruled  through \nthe  procedures  set out  in Section  633.135,  RSMo,  et ~· \nB.  If a  client is recommended  for  placement  and  does  not \nhave  a  guardian,  but does  have  interested parents  or  family \nmembers  known  to the  defendants,  those  parents or  family members \nshall be  notified  and  allowed  twenty  (20)  days  from  the  receipt \n- 7  -\n\nof notice to  initiate guardianship procedures.  such  notification \nshall  include  information describing the  rights  relating to \ncommunity  placement  that are  secured through  guardianship  and \nexplaining to the  interested parents  or  family  members  how  they \nmay  go  about  seeking appointment  as  guardians.  Following  the \ntwenty  (20)  day  period,  defendants  may:  (1)  seek appointment  of  a \nguardian,  (2)  place  the  client by  his consent,  subject to the \nprovisions  of paragraph  13  (C),  below,  or  (3)  place the  client \nover his objection through  the procedures  set forth  in Section \n633.135  RSMo,  et seq. \nC.  A  client without  a  guardian may  consent  to a \nplacement,  provided  he  is capable  of giving valid and  competent \nconsent.  However,  no  Bellefontaine client shall be placed  in \nanother  facility under  these circumstances  unless  he  is first \ndetermined  to be  able  to give valid and  competent  consent by  a \nlicensed psychologist  or psychiatrist. \n14.  Defendants  shall  continue to observe the \nrequirements  of Section  633.145,  RSMo,  with  respect to \n\"transfers\"  of  Bellefontaine clients to other  \"department mental \nretardation  facilities.\"  In the  event that Bellefontaine  is \nadministratively merged,  or  otherwise becomes  affiliated with, \nanother  state-owned  or operated  facility not currently a  part of \nBellefontaine,  the same  rights  and  procedures  as  those prescribed \nin Section  633.145,  RSMo,  shall  apply  to the transfer to such \nother  facility of  a  Bellefontaine client residing at \nBellefontaine at the time  any  such merger  or affiliation is \n- 8  -\n\nimplemented.  Defendants  and plaintiffs may  agree  to alternative \nprocedures  that would  apply  to the  transfer of  a  Bellefontaine \nclient in such  circumstances. \n15.  From  time  to time,  Bellefontaine residents placed  in \ncommunity  facilities may  fail  to make  a  satisfactory adjustment \nto their new  residential  environment.  In order to  facilitate the \nprocess  of  securing  consent  to  appropriate  placements  from \nresidents'  parents and  guardians,  defendants  agree to the \nfollowing: \nA.  Defendants  agree  that they  shall provide  readmission \non  a  priority basis  to any  former  Bellefontaine client for whom, \nin the  judgment  of the St.  Louis  Regional  Center,  a  return to \nBellefontaine  is appropriate. \nB.  Defendants  agree that,  with  respect to  Bellefontaine \nclients whose  placement  in the community  is based  on  the consent \nof the client or his guardian,  the  following  procedures  shall \napply:  the  first twenty-eight  (28)  days  following  transfer of \nthe  client to the  community  facility shall  be  deemed  a  trial \nvisit.  During  the  first fourteen  (14)  days  of this visit,  only \nthe st.  Louis  Regional  Center may  decide  to terminate  the visit. \nDuring  the  following  fourteen  (14)  days,  the person  (client or \nguardian)  who  initially consented to the  client's visit may \nwithdraw his  consent.  If consent  is withdrawn,  the  st.  Louis \nRegional  Center  shall determine  whether  an  appropriate \nalternative placement  in the community  is available  for  the \nclient.  If no  less  restrictive alternative  is available and \n- 9  -\n\nacceptable  to the person withdrawing  consent,  the client shall be \nreturned to Bellefontaine or placed  in a  state owned  and  operated \nfacility,  subject to the  rights  and  procedures  described  in \nparagraph  14  of this Decree.  If consent  is not withdrawn  during \nthe  fourteen  (14)  day  period,  the  trial visit shall become  a \nregular placement.  Nothing  herein  shall prevent defendants  from \nseeking the placement  of  a  client pursuant  to the procedures  set \nforth  in Section  633.135,  RSMo,  et seq.,  over the  objection of  a \nguardian or client. \nc.  Following  the above-referenced twenty-eight  (28)  day \nperiod,  the person or persons who  initially consented to a \nclient's community  placement,  or whose  objection to such \nplacement was  overruled  through  the procedures  set forth  in \nSection  633.135,  RSMo,  et seq.,  may  submit  a  request that the \nclient be  readmitted  to  Bellefontaine.  Defendants  agree  that \nthey will  give  serious  consideration to  such  a  request,  and  that \nthe person  or persons making  the  request  shall  be  given  an \nopportunity,  in a  meeting with  officials of  Bellefontaine andjor \nthe St.  Louis  Regional  Center,  to  set forth  reasons  why \nBellefontaine would  be more  appropriate  for the  affected client \nthan the client's community  placement. \nD.  The  readmission  of  any  Bellefontaine client pursuant \nto  subsections A,  B  and  c,  supra,  shall  not prevent defendants \nfrom  attempting  on  subsequent  occasions  to place such  client in \nthe  same  or alternative community  facilities. \n16.  Defendants  will  retain their present policy of \n- 10  -\n\nplacing Bellefontaine residents  in nursing homes  only  in those \nrare cases  in which  the advanced  age  or physical  infirmities of \nthe  resident make  a  nursing home  the most  appropriate placement. \n17.  Defendants will make  a  good  faith effort to provide, \nthrough  caseworkers  of the St.  Louis  Regional  Center  or \notherwise,  adequate  levels  of monitoring  and  follow-up  for \nBellefontaine clients who  are placed  in community  facilities. \nPhysical  Plant \n18.  Defendants  will,  as  soon  as  practicable,  provide \nsuch  renovations  to the group homes  at Bellefontaine as  are \nnecessary to bring all such  residences  into compliance with the \n''institutional occupancy\"  standards  of the  Life Safety Code. \nClient Injuries \n19.  Recognizing  that some  injuries to clients are \ninevitable at a  facility  like Bellefontaine,  defendants  agree \nthat they  shall make  every effort,  consistent with professionally \naccepted standards of care,  to protect clients against physical \nharm  and  other  forms  of abuse.  It is acknowledged  that certain \nclients at Bellefontaine,  whether due  to maladaptive behaviors  or \nother problems,  pose  a  high  risk of  injury to themselves  or \nothers.  The  composition  of this group  of clients  is subject to \nchange,  as  is the absolute number  of such  clients.  Defendants \nagree that,  so  long  as  such  \"high  risk\"  clients are  resident at \nBellefontaine,  they  shall be provided with  special programming \n- 11  -\n\nand  increased  staffing to protect against  injuries and  to alter \nbehaviors  that lead to  injuries. \n20.  Defendants  agree  that no  more  than  one  Developmental \nAssistant  shall  serve on  each  Board  of  Inquiry of the Resident \nAbuse  Committee  assigned to  investigate allegations  of  staff \nabuse  or neglect.  Defendants  further  agree  that the  Department \nof Mental  Health  shall promptly  respond  to  inquiries regarding \nthe policies and  practices governing  the Resident Abuse \nCommittee,  and  that the  Bellefontaine Superintendent shall \npromptly  respond  to  inquiries  from  parents  or guardians  regarding \nallegations  of  abuse  and  neglect  involving  their relatives.  In \naddition,  the  Bellefontaine Superintendant  shall  seriously \nconsider recommendations  of the Parents Association  regarding the \noperation and makeup  of the Resident Abuse  Committee. \n21.  Defendants  shall continue to make  every effort, \nconsistent with professionally accepted  standards  of care,  to \nassure  that residents  are adequately protected  from  traffic and \nother hazards  on  or near the Bellefontaine grounds. \nParents Association \n22.  At  least four  times  each year,  the Superintendent  of \nBellefontaine shall meet  with the Parents Association of the st. \nLouis  State School  and  Hospital  to discuss  any  issues  of concern \nto the  Parents Association.  In these discussions  the \nSuperintendant shall not  disclose confidential  information \npertaining to  individual  clients.  However,  shortly after such \n- 12  -\n\nmeetings,  the Superintendant shall make  himself available to meet \nindividually with parents of Bellefontaine  clients and  to discuss \nwith them  issues  of  concern pertaining to their relatives at \nBellefontaine. \n23.  Defendants  agree that they will permit  the  Parents \nAssociation's continued operation of a  \"Thrift Shop\"  on  the \nBellefontaine grounds  under terms  and  conditions consistent with \napplicable state statutes and  regulations.  In the  event \ndefendants  and  the Parents Association are unable  to reach \nagreement  on  such terms  and  conditions,  or  in the  event  the \nParents Association decides  to  relocate  its \"Thrift Shop\"  off \nBellefontaine grounds,  defendants  nonetheless  shall permit the \nParents Association to continue to receive donations  of clothing \nand  other articles at the  same  location at Bellefontaine where \nsuch donations  are currently received,  or at such  other location \non  the  Bellefontaine grounds  as  is mutually  acceptable to the \nParents Association  and  defendants  and  consistent with  state \nstatutes and  regulations. \nState and  Federal  Law  Rights \n24.  Nothing  in this consent  decree  shall  be  construed to \nlimit or restrict any  rights accorded by  State or  federal  law to \nBellefontaine clients,  their parents,  or other  interested family \nmembers,  or their legal guardians.  In the  event of  any  change  in \nState or federal  law,  or the enforcement  of  such  laws,  that \nrequires  or effectively requires  the defendants  to act  in a \n- 13  -\n\nmanner  inconsistent with this Decree,  the defendants  may  petition \nthe  Court  for  appropriate modifications  to relevant provisions  of \nthe  Decree. \nImplementation \n25.  For  a  period of three years  from  the date  of this \ndecree,  defendants  shall  report  at least annually  to the  Court \nand  plaintiffs concerning their compliance  with this decree.  The \nCourt  shall  retain jurisdiction over this matter  for  a  minimum  of \nthree years  and  for  so  long as  necessary to ensure  that the  terms \nof the decree  are being  fully  implemented. \nAttorneys'  Fees \n26.  The  parties agree that plaintiffs shall be \nreimbursed  for  attorneys'  fees  and  reasonable  expenses \nattributable to:  (1)  their obtaining certification of this case \nas  a  plaintiff-class action;  and  (2)  to the  Court's preliminary \ndecision regarding the provision of  specialized therapy  services \nto residents  at Bellefontaine.  The  attorneys'  fee  rate shall be \n$75  per hour  for  out-of-court time  and  $95  per hour  for  in-court \ntime.  The  parties agree  that,  so  calculated,  the amount  of  fees \nto be paid to plaintiffs  is $20,000,  and  the  amount  of expenses \nto be  paid to plaintiffs  is $5,000.  The  plaintiffs agree that \nthe defendants  shall not be  liable for  any  additional  attorneys' \nfees,  costs  or expenses  relating to the above-referenced matters \nor other legal  services that have  been  rendered by  plaintiffs' \n- 14  -\n\nattorneys. \nNotice to the  Class \n27.  Notice  of this  settlement will  be  sent to all class \nmembers  and  their guardians  or closest family  members  in a  form \napproved  by  the parties and  the Court.  Defendants  shall be \nresponsible  for  the distribution of this notice  and  any  further \nnotice that may  be  required by  the Court. \n\nFOR  PLAINTIFFS:  FOR  DEFENDANTS: \n(k____ \nN  FiRR  DEPARTMENT  OF  MENTAL  HEALTH \n& \n~ \nPAUL  R.

JURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n1.  This  is an  action brought by. an  organization of \nparents  and  relatives of the mentally retarded and  by mentally \nretarded individuals,  citizens of the  State of Missouri,  to secure \ntheir rights under  the United  States Constitution and  federal \nand  state statutes.  The  action is filed  in plaintiffs'  names \nby  their next best friends,  pursuant to Rule  17,  Federal \nRules  of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs bring this suit on  their \nown  behalf  and on  behalf of a  class of  similarly situated \nmentally retarded persons.  Plaintiffs seek  injunctive, \ndeclaratory and other appropriate relief requiring that \nthey be  provided with adequate care and  treatment,  a  humane \nand decent  living environment,  and protection against \nphysical harm  and  attack. \n2.  This  case  arises under  the Constitution and  laws \nof  the United  States as well  as  the  laws  of Missouri. \nPlaintiffs'  claims  are predicated on  the  Due  Process Clause \nof  the Fourteenth Amendment;  42  U.S.C.  section 1983,  1985, \nand  1986;  section 504  of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29  U.S.C.  794  (1980  Supp.);  and  sections  630.005  et seq. \nof  the Revised Missouri  Statutes,  RSMo.  630.005  et seq. \n(Vernon's).  This Court has  jurisdiction of this matter \nunder  28  u.s.c.  sections  1331,  1343,  2201,  2202;  42  u.s.c. \nsections  1983,  1985,  1986,  1988,  and  principles of pendent \njurisdiction.  The  amount  in controversy exceeds  ten \nthousand dollars  ($10,000.00),  exclusive of  interest and \ncosts.  Venue  appropriately lies in this  judicial district \npursuant to  28  U.S.C.  139l(b). \n3.  Monetary  damages  are inadequate to compensate \nplaintiffs for  the abridgement of their rights and  to protect \nplaintiffs from  further  and  continued  abridgement of their \nrights.  Additivnally,  the actions,  policies,  and  procedures \nchallenged in this suit have  caused,  and will continue  to \ncause,  substantial and  irreparable injury to plaintiffs. \n\n- 3  -\nTOMMY  CRESSEY \n6.  Plaintiff Tommy  Cressey is a  23-year old resident \nof the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital.  Floyd Cressey, \nhis  father  and  next  friend,  resides  at 12640 Meadowdale \nDrive,  St.  Louis,  Missouri. \n7.  Tommy  is profoundly retarded.  He  is also \nepileptic and  hyperactive,  conditions  for which he  now \nreceives medication.  Tommy  is almost  completely helpless \nbecause of  his handicap.  He  is unable  to talk or read and \ncannot dress  himself without assistance.  Tommy  is only \npartly toilet trained. \n8.  Tommy  was  first admitted to the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and  Hsopital  in 1966 when  he was  8  years  old. \nConditions at the  institution at that time were  so deplorable \nthat Tommy  was  withdrawn by his parents only three weeks \nafter admission.  Tommy  was  confined to a  single building \nhousing over  60  retarded children attended by only a  single \nstaff aide.  To maintain discipline,  the aide  tied many \nof  the  children to their beds.  At the end of  his short \nstay Tommy  was  emaciated,  having  lost nearly 20  or  30  pounds \nin only three weeks. \n9.  Tommy  lived at horne  for  the next two  years while \nhis parents  searched for  an  acceptable placement.  In 1968 \narrangements were made  to place Tommy  in the  \"Jer-Lee\" \nnursing horne  in St.  Louis,  a  large facility with about  100 \npatients,  including many mentally retarded persons. \n10.  At  first the Jer-Lee horne  worked  out satisfac \ntorily for  Tommy.  Although the care provided Tommy  was \nmainly  custodial,  the  facility was  at least clean and well \nmanaged.  As  time went on,  however,  the owners  of the \nJer-Lee horne experienced financial difficulties and  conditions \ndeteriorated rapidly.  One  day  the  facility filed  for bank \nruptcy and  all the  residents,  including Tommy,  were  abruptly \nshut out.  Tommy's  parents were  given no  notice that the \n\n- 4  -\nhome  was  on  the verge of closing down.  Because of  inadequate \nmonitoring of  the  facility, the state Department of Mental \nHealth was  also caught by  surprise. \n11.  Tommy,  together with  some  of the other displaced \nresidents,  was  placed temporarily at the Diagnostic Center \nin Hannibal.  The  staff at the Center  immediately  sought \nto place Tommy  in another non-institutional community \nfacility.  However,  Tommy's  parents objected to the inadequate \nfoster homes  and  group homes  that they were  shown,  and  Tommy \nwas  permitted to stay at the Diagnostic Center  for approxi \nmately three years. \n12.  At  the end of that time,  arrangements were made \nto transfer Tommy  to a  new  foster home  in Festus,  Missouri. \nAlthough  skeptical  about  the  suitability of  this placement, \nTommy's  parents consented after receiving repeated assurances \nthat the managers  of the  facility would be  able  to cope with \nTommy.  As  it turned out,  however,  they could not.  Tommy \nhad  to be withdrawn  from  the Festus home  on  the  same  day \nthat he was  transferred there.  Tommy  was  subsequently \nreadmitted to the St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital  and \nhas  been there ever since.  Tommy's  parents are concerned \nthat defendants may  again  seek to place him  in an  inappro \npriate community  facility. \nBUDDY  KONCZAKOWSKI \n13.  Plaintiff Buddy Konczakowski  is a  29-year old \nmentally retarded adult.  Virginia Konczakowski,  his \nmother  and next best friend,  resides at 315  Brockleigh \nStreet,  Florissant, Missouri. \n14.  Buddy  is a  former  resident of the  St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital.  He  is mildly to moderately \nretarded,  toilet trained and partially verbal.  Although \nBuddy  functions  at a  higher  level than many  of  the  resi \ndents at the  State School  and  Hospital,  he  nonetheless \nrequires close supervision and  attention. \n\n·....,_/ \n- 5  -\n15.  Buddy was  admitted  to the  St.  Louis  State School \nand  Hospital  16  years  ago,  at age  13.  Buddy  resided at \nthe  institution continuously until last fall,  when \nofficials decided  to transfer Buddy  to a  community-based \nresidential home.  Buddy's mother was  told that the insti \ntution was  under pressure to  reduce  the  resident popula \ntion by  at least 60  persons  by  July 1982,  and  that Buddy \nhad been  selected as one of  the  residents to be  discharged. \nBuddy's mother opposed  this decision on  the grounds  that a \ntransfer to a  community  home  would be  disruptive and poten \ntially traumatic  for  Buddy. \n16.  In  late October 1981,  Buddy was  transferred by \nthe  St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital  to the Life  Skills \ncommunity  facility in St.  Louis,  a  four-unit  apartment \nbuilding located on Olive  Street.  Buddy was  placed in a \nunit with three other retarded boys.  They were  supervised \nby  a  visiting social worker during the day.  At night \nBuddy  and  the other boys were  unattended,  although a  house \nparent with overall responsibility lived downstairs. \n17.  For  a  brief period,  Buddy  seemed  to adjust \nreasonably well  to his new  environment.  In  late December, \nhowever,  his condition deteriorated rapidly.  Buddy  became \nseriously depressed and,  eventually,  suicidal.  Buddy \nwas  taken to a  private hospital  in  St.  Louis  for observation \nand  treatment.  The  hospital  initially tried to treat Buddy \nwith anti-depressant drugs.  After several weeks,  the doctors \nresorted to the use  of electro-shock therapy. \n18.  In all,  Buddy  received 10  electric shocks  before \nhis mood  began  to stabilize and  he  stopped his  suicidal \nbehavior.  Buddy  remained  at the hospital  for  further ob \nservation for  about  two months.  At  the end of that time, \nBuddy's mother  sought  to have  him readmitted to the \n\n~ \n- 6  -\nSt.  Louis  State  School  and Hospital.  However,  the \nauthorities there  stated that Buddy  could not return as \na  full-time  resident because the institution remained \nunder extreme  pressure to move  people out.  Buddy's \nmother was  told that she would  either have  to care  for \nBuddy  at horne  or consent to his placement  in still \nanother community-based  facility. \n1~.'  Buddy  is currently living at horne  with his \nmother.  Although  she  is unable  to care for Buddy  herself, \nthe Regional  Center and  the  State School  and  Hospital  have \nleft her with no  choice.  If Buddy  is transferred again \nto a  community  facility,  he may  suffer a  further  relapse \nwith potentially devastating consequences.  State officials \nare  aware  of this and  yet refuse to permit Buddy's  readmission \nto the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital. \nPHILIP  GAMACHE \n20.  Plaintiff Philip Gamache  is a  20-year old resident \nof theSt.  Louis  State School  and Hospital.  Mary  Jane \nGamache,  his mother  and next best friend,  resides at \n1735  Del Norte  Street,  St.  Louis,  Missouri. \n21.  Philip has  been at the  St.  Louis  State School \nand Hospital  for  approximately two  years.  He  is profoundly \nretarded and  has  autistic tendencies.  Philip is unable \nto provide even minimal  care for  himself.  He  cannot read \nor speak  at all.  He  also needs  assistance to use  the \nbathroom and to dress or feed  himself. \n22.  Philip lived at horne  until age  11.  In 1973, \nafter having attended a  special education program on  a \nday  basis  for  several years,  Philip was  admitted to the \nDiagnostic Center in Hannibal,  Missouri  for  testing and \nbehavior modification.  The  Diagnostic Center placed \nPhilip in the  first of a  series of community  residential \nfacilities.  ~acn of  these placements proved unsuccessful \nand Philip eventually had  to be  admitted to the  St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital. \n\n'-.../' \n- 7  -\n23.  Philip's first community placement was  a  small \nfoster  home  in Monroe  Count~ about  20  miles  from Hannibal. \nThe  facility was  an  ordinary residential dwelling,  housing \nseveral retarded children.  ThG  couple  in charge of  the \nhome  were  unable  to properly care  for  Philip.  He \ndeveloped behavioral problems  and  refused  to  sleep at \nnight.  Within  six months,  Philip's parents were  told \nthat he  had  to be withdrawn  from  the  facility. \n2 4.  The  State Department of ~len tal Health next \narranged to place Philip in another  foster home  in \nHannibal  comparable  in size to the  first foster home. \nAlthough this facility was  initially promising,  the \ncare  and  conditions deteriorated  when  the home \nwas  relocated to Bowling  Green,  Missouri. \nOn  several occasions Philip came  home  for weekend visits \nwith evidence  that he  had been physically abused,  including \nbruises on  his  legs  and  a  burn on his  shoulder. \n25.  Philip was  subsequently returned to the \nDiagnostic  Center  for  further evaluation and  testing. \nAfter about two  years  the Diagnostic Center again \nsought to place Philip in a  small  residential home. \nPhilip's parents  strongly opposed this decision,  but \nwere  told that they had no  choice in the matter. \nPhilip's parents were  assured that this time  the community \nplacement would  be  carefully screened in advance  and that \nPhilip would  be  closely monitored at the new  facility. \nNonetheless,  this third community placement also proved \nunsuccessful.  Within one week,  Philip was  forced  to leave \nand was  returned to the Diagnostic Ce\"nter  in Hannibal. \n\n- 8  - ....../ \n26.  The  constant shuttling of Philip from one  unstable \ncommunity  environment  to another  led to a  deterioration in \nhis condition.  Philip became  depressed.  He  also resumed \nself-abusive behavior that had  been brought under  control \nin prior years.  Despite these problems,  the Department of \nMental  Health  attempted to place Philip in still another \ncommunity  residential  facility.  This  time,  however,  Philip's \nparents refused and  arrangements were made  to admit Philip \nto the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital.  Philip's parents \ncontinue  to be  concerned  that he will again be  placed in an \ninappropriate community  setting. \nLAURA  RICHERT \n27.  Plaintiff Laura Richert  is a  resident of the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital.  Carol  and  Roger \nRichert,  her parents  and  next best friends,  reside at \n4414  Rosedon  Drive,  Bridgeton,  Missouri. \n28.  Laura  is 22  years old.  She  is profoundly \nretarded and  autistic.  Laura  cannot  read at all and \nhas  only  limited verbal  ability.  She  is given  to radical \nchanges  in weight and mood  and  is currently receiving \nantidepressant drugs  to stabilize her behavior.  Laura \nalso has  a  tendency to abuse  herself,  typically by \nscratching her  arms  until they bleed. \n29.  At  age  9,  Laura was  admitted to the  first of \na  series of  residential  facilities  for  the mentally retarded, \nboth public  and  private.  The  first was  the Regional  Center \nin Kirksville,  Missouri,  where  Laura  stayed  for  approxi \nmately three months.  The  second was  a  large private \ninstitutional facility in Louisiana where  Laura resided \nuntil about 1971. \n\n-..._,_,/ \n- 9  -\n30·  Laura was  subsequently placed  in the Emmaus \nHorne  in St.  Charles,  Missouri,  another  large residential \nfacility for  the mentally retarded.  Laura had  to leave \nthis facility after abo~t two  years  because  it did not \nprovide  the  educational  services to which  she became \nentitled under  state law.  Also,  Laura was  regarded as  a \ndisciplinary problem.  On  several occasions  she  slipped \naway  from  the  residential buildings  and wandered  off the \ngrounds  of the horne. \n31.  Laura was  next transferred to the privately \nowned  Laurel  Haven  residential facility  for  the mentally \nretarded in Ballwin,  Missouri.  There Laura began  to develop \nserious problems.  She  became  self-abusive and with-\ndrawn.  Laura also became  seriously underweight, \nat one  point weighing  as  little as  89  pounds.  Finally, \nthe Regional  Center  in St.  Louis made  arrangements  to have \nLaura  aQ~itted to the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital. \n32.  Laura's  admission  to the  State School  and \nHospital  has  at least brought a  respite  from  the constant \nshuttling from one  community-based  facility to  another. \nHowever,  Laura  still fails to receive the degree of \nsupervision needed  to improve  her condition and  to provide \nadequate protection from  physical abuse.  Because  of  staff \nshortages,  Laura  is frequently  left unattended  for  long \nperiods of time.  On  such occasions  she  abuses  herself \nand  is subject to physical attack by other residents. \nLaura's parents have  observed bruises on Laura's body, \nincluding biternarks  along  the backs  of her  legs. \n33.  Laura's parents believe that the deficiencies \nat the  State School  and  Hospital can be  cured and  that the \nfacility is an  appropriate placement  for  her.  They  are  con \ncerned that she will be  transferred to a  community  facility \nthat is inappropriate to care  for  her basic needs. \n\n- 1 0-\nDAVID  ANDREWS \n34.  ~laintiff David Andrews  is 20  years  old and  a \nresident of the  St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital. \nDavid  has  been  living at the  institution since 1979.  Bernarn \nAndrews,  his  father  and  next best friend,  resides  at 12129 \nWesland  Drive,  Maryland  Heights,  Missouri. \n35.  David  is profoundly retarded and hyperactive. \nHe  has  no verbal  ability at all and  is only partially \ntoilet trained.  David needs  constant attention and  super \nvision.  Without  assistance,  he  cannot  feed or dress  himself. \nHe  also engages  in self-abusive behavior. \n36.  In 1973  David's parents  arranged to have  him \nplaced at Laurel  Haven,  a  large,  privately owned  residental \nfacility in Ballwin,  Missouri.  Laurel  Haven  housed nearly \n100 mentally retarded persons,  most  of  them  less handi \ncapped than David.  David was  a  serious disciplinary problem. \nOn  a  number  of occasions  he  attempted  to run  away,  and he \nfinally had  to be  confined to the infirmary where  he  was \nguarded on  a  regular basis.  After about  5  years,  David's \nparents were  asked to withdraw him  for  further evaluation. \nDavid was  subsequently placed in the  St.  Louis  State School \nand Hospital. \n37.  The  shortage of properly trained personnel at \nthe  State School  and Hospital has  exposed David  to serious \nphysical harm.  On  one  occasion he  suffered serious burns \nbecause of the negligence of an  institution staff aide. \nNevertheless,  David's parents believe that,  with some  improve \nment,  the  State School  and  Hospital would  be  a  satisfactory \nplacement  for  him.  They  are concerned  that the  transfer to \nan  inadequate  community  facility would  cause him harm  and \nfurther deterioration. \nPAT  NORWOOD \n38.  Plaintiff Pat Norwood  is a  25-year old mentally \nretarded woman  and  resident of the  St.  Louis  State School \nand  Hospital.  Lois Qualls,  her  stepmother and  next best \nfriend,  resides  at 2143  Esther  Street,  St.  Louis,  Missouri. \n\n- 11  -\n39.  Pat is moderately retarded.  She  is unable  to read \nand  has  only  limited verbal  ability.  Pat walks  with a  limp \nas  a  result of childhood polio.  She  is also given to wild \nand  sudden  fluctuations  in mood.  Much  of the  time Pat is \nvery passive  and withdrawn.  Then,  without notice,  she can \nbecome  wild and  uncontrollable. \n40.  Pat  lived at home  with her  family  until she was \n17.  During those years  she  attended a  number  of  special \nschools on  a  day basis.  At  home  she  needed constant super \nvision and protection to assure that she did not run  away \nor hurt herself.  At  age  17  Pat suffered a  nervous breakdown \nand was  hospitalized for  a  period of three months.  Her \ncondition deteriorated rapidly and  her  parents  found  that \nthey could no  longer care  for her by  themselves.  Reluctantly, \nthey made  arrangements  to admit Pat to the  St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital. \n41.  At  the  institution Pat.has  suffered from neglect \nand  physical harm.  On  one  occasion,  Pat was  assaulted and \nraped by  three male  retarded residents.  The  incident occurred \nbecause Pat had been  left unattended outside of her  living \nunit.  She was  discovered  lying face  down  on  the ground  and \nunconscious.  On  another occasion,  Pat attempted to run \naway  from  the institution and  became  caught on  a  chain-link \nfence  that partially surrounds  the grounds  of the  State \nSchool  and Hospital.  Pat hung helplessly on  the  fence  for \nmany  hours  until she was  spotted by  a  passing motorist who \nnotified the  institution. \n42.  Despite  these deficiencies,  Laura's parents are \nconcerned  that she will be  transferred to an  even  less adequate \ncommunity  facility which will worsen  her situation. \nDANNY  REISENBECK \n43.  Plaintiff Danny  Reisenbeck  is currently a  resident \nof the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital.  William Reisen \nbeck,  his  father  and  next best friend,  resides at 3160  Leola \nStreet,  St.  Louis,  Missouri. \n\n._../ \n- 12  -\n44.  Danny  is 21  years old.  He  was  diagnosed as  re \ntarded when  he was  nine months  old,  after a  series of  seizures \nthat caused substantial brain damage.  Danny  is profoundly \nretarded with a  mental  age of  a  four-year  old child.  He \nis epileptic and hyperactive,  both conditions  for which \nhe  receives regular medication.  Danny  is unable  to read \nand  has  only  limited verbal ability.  His  hyperactive \ncondition sometimes  results  in extreme  self-destructive \nbehavior. \n45.  Until he was  admitted to the  State School  and \nHospital at age  12,  Danny  attended a  succession of \nschools  and  institutions for  the mentally retarded. \nWhen  Danny was  four years old,  he was  enrolled in a \nspecial pre-school  in the  St.  Louis  area  for  retarded \nchildren.  Because of his disruptive behavior,  however, \nhe  lasted there only about  two weeks.  Danny was  next \nplaced with the  St.  Louis Association  for Retarded \nChildren,  where  he  stayed  for  approximately two  years. \n46.  Subsequently,  Danny was  placed in  a  series \nof  facilities  for  the  retarded,  both public and private. \nDanny was  enrolled on  a  day basis at the Good  Shepard \nSchool  in St.  Louis  and  the New  Hope  Facility for \nretarded children.  From January to September  1973, \nhe  lived at the  Diagnostic Center in Hannibal,  Missouri, \nand  from  September  1973  to April  1975,  he  resided at \nthe Laurel Haven  facility in Ballwin,  Missouri.  Because \nof behavioral problems,  Danny  eventually had to be \nwithdrawn  from each of these schools  and  institutions. \n\n- 13-\n47.  Danny  lived at home  for  brief intervals ~s his \nparents  searched  for  suitable placements.  These were \nextremely difficult times.  Neighbors  complained about \nDanny's  appearance and  behavior and  he was  subjected to \nridicule  from  neighborhood  children.  Danny's  parents \nwere  afraid to  let him out of  their sight  for  even  a  few \nhours.  On  one occasion he  broke  through  the window  of \nhis  second-story room  and  jumped off the  ledge  to the \nground. \n48.  Danny was  admitted  to the St.  Louis  State School \nand Hospital  in 1973.  Danny's  commitment  at least ended \nthe constant and debilitating movement  from  one  residen \ntial facility to another.  However,  Danny  has  not received \nadequate care and protection at the  institution.  On  one \noccasion  shortly after his admission,  Danny  had  to be \ntaken  to a  hospital  for  treatment of a  broken  arm.  His \nparents were  later advised  that the  injury was  caused by \nan  institution staff aide who  had  beaten Danny with a \nbroom handle.  On  numerous  other occasions Danny's  parents \nhave  found  scars and  bruises on  his body. \n49.  While  Danny's  parents are concerned about  these \nproblems,  they nevertheless  think that the  State School  and \nHospital  is an  appropriate placement  for  him  and  fear  that \nhe will be  placed in an  inadequate  community  facility where \nhe will be mistreated. \nIII.  CLASS  ACTION \n50.  Plaintiffs the Parents Association,  Tommy  Cressey, \nBuddy  Konczakowski,  Philip Gamache,  Laura Richert,  David \nAndrews,  Pat Norwood  and  Danny  Reisenbeck  bring this action \non  their own  behalf and on behalf of all mentally retarded \npersons who  are currently residing at the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and  Hospital,  who  may  need  to be  admitted  to the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital .in the  future,  or who \nhave  been residents of the  St.  Louis  State School  and \nHospital at any  time  since 1973. \n\n- 14  -\n51.  Plaintiffs seek  for  themselves  and members  of \nthe class declaratory,  injunctive and  other appropriate \nrelief requiring defendants  to provide  them with adequate \ncare and  treatment and  protection against physical  abuse \nin a  decent and  humane  living environment with  facilities \nand  services that are  adequate  to plaintiffs'  needs. \nSpecifically,  plaintiffs seek relief prohibiting continued \nreductions  in funding  and  staffing levels  for  the  St.  Louis \nState School  and  Hospital.  Plaintiffs also seek relief \nprohibiting their transfer to,  and placement  in,  non \ninstitutional,  community-based  facilities  that fail to \nprovide  the quality and  level of  care offered by  full-\nservice  institutions certified as  intermediate care facilities \nfor  the mentally retarded.  Further,  plaintiffs seek  relief \nrequiring  defendants  to provide  improved  care and  treatment \nto  those members  of  the plaintiff class and  other retarded \npersons who  are currently residents of  such community-based \nfacilities. \n52.  This  is a  proper class action under  rule  23(a)  and \n23(b) (1)  and  (2)  of the Federal  Rules  of Civil Procedure. \nThe  class is so numerous  as  to make  joinder of all members \nimpracticable.  There  are substantial questions of  law and \nfact common  to the entire class,  and  the  claims  of  the \nplaintiffs are typical of  the  class and  predominate over \nany questions  affecting only  individual class members. \nThe  named  plaintiffs will adequately and  fairly represent \nthe  interests of the  class.  In  addition, a  class action is \nsuperior to any other available method  for  the fair and \nefficient adjudication of  this controversy. \n\n- 15  -\n53.  The  questions of  law and  fact common  to the \nentire class and  to the claims of each plaintiff include: \n(a)  Have  the defendants  failed to place \nplaintiffs and  the members  of the plaintiff \nclass in humane  and  safe living environments \nthat are  suitable and  appropriate to their \nmental  and  physical conditions and  provide \nrealistic personal security,  including \nprotection from  assaults or other harms? \n(b)  Have  the defendants  failed to provide \nplaintiffs and members  of  the plaintiff class \nwith such individual treatment as  is appropriate \nto their mental  conditions? \nIV.  DEFENDANTS \nCHRISTOPHER  S.  BOND \n54.  Defendant Christopher s.  Bond  is Governor \nof the  State of Missouri.  Defendant Bond oversees and \nis responsible  for the  activities,  policies,  and practices \nof  all executive departments  and  agencies  in the  state, \nincluding the Missouri  Department of Mental  Health.

Persons  admitted to the  St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital are  screened and  evaluated for \nsuch placement by  the  St.  Louis  Regional  Center.  Residents \nof  the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital who  are discharged \nfrom  the  institution are  referred to the  St.  Louis  Regional \nCenter  for placement  in community-based  noninstitutional \nfacilities.  The  Regional  Centers are also responsible \nfor  the  licensing of all community  residential facilities, \nand  for  the regulation and monitoring of  the  care  and  treat \nment provided by  such  facilities. \n\n- 19  -\nJOS~PH W.  KUNZ \n60.  Defendant Joseph W.  Kunz  is the  Superintendent \nof the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital.  In  this \ncapacity defendant Kunz  has  \"charge,  control and management\" \nof  all aspects of the  institution's activities.  RSMo. \nsection 630.040(1).  Defendant Kunz  is responsible  for \nthe  hiring and  training of  the  staff of the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and Hospital.

FACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \nTHE  ST.  LOUIS  STATE  SCHOOL  AND  HOSPITAL \n61. The  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital  is a \nstate-owned and  operated intermediate care residential \nfacility for  the mentally retarded.  Opened  in 1924, \nthe  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital was  operated \nby  the city of  St.  Louis  until 1948,  when  the properties \nand program responsibilities were  turned over to the \nstate.  The  institution serves mentally retarded state \nresidents  from  St.  Louis  City,  St.  Charles,  Franklin, \nJefferson,  and  St.  Louis  counties.  The  St.  Louis  State \n\n\"'---\n- 20  -\nSchool  and Hospital  is located on a  five hundred acre \nproperty off Bellefontaine Road  in north St.  Louis \nCounty. \n62.  The  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital  is one \nof  five  full-service  institutional facilities for the \nmentally retarded operated by  the state of Missouri.  The \nothers are  the Higginsville State School  and  Hospital, \nthe Marshall  State School  and Hospital,  the Nevada  State \nSchool  and Hospital  and  the St.Louis Developmental  Dis \nabilities Treatment  Center.  These  institutions provide \nservices  for  the mentally retarded in conjunction with \neleven  state~operated Regional  Centers  located throughout \nthe  state.  The  Regional Centers provide diagnostic and \nevaluat;on services prior to placement  in an  institution \nor community  residential  facility.  The  Regional Center \naffiliated with the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nis the  St.  Louis  Regional  Center,  located at 2500  Hampton \nStreet,  St.  Louis,  Missouri.  All persons  admitted to the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and Hospital  are  screened by  the \nRegional  Center to determine  the appropriateness of  institu \ntional placement.  The  Regional  Center  is also responsible \nfor the placement  in private residential facilities of all \nmentally retarded persons  discharged  from the  St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital. \n63.  Upon  information and belief,  full-time mentally \nretarded residents of the  St.  Louis  State School  currently \nnumber  approximately  460.  The  vast majority of these \nresidents  are adults.  Upon  information and belief,  only \nabout  2%  of  the residents at the St.  Louis  State School \nand  Hospital  are below 18  years  of age;  8%  range  in age \n\n- 21  -\nfrom  18  to 20;  71%  range  in age  from  21  to  35;  18%  range \nin age  from  36  to  55;  and only 1%  of the  residents are \n56  years  old or older.  As  of January 1982,  the average \nage  of residents  at the St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nwas  29. \n64.  The  estimated  460  residents  of the St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital  are the most  seriously disabled \nof all mentally retarded persons  in the geographic  area \nserved by  the institution.  Upon  information and  belief, \n44%  of the residents of  the St.  Louis  State School and \nHospital  are diagnosed as  \"profoundly\"  retarded.  Such \npersons  have  IQ  scores below  20  and  generally cannot \naspire to a  mental age  of more  than  2  to 2  1/2 years. \nThe  average  life expectancy  for  a  profoundly retarded \nindividual is 40.  Profoundly retarded persons  rarely, \nif ever,  develop  intelligible speech,  and  up  to 40%  of \nall profoundly retarded individuals  are bedridden or \nsemi-ambulatory. \n65.  Upon  information and  belief,  nearly  40%  of \nthe residents  of the St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nare  \"severely\"  retarded.  Such persons  are only slightly \nless disabled  than profoundly  retarded individuals.  The \nseverely retarded have  IQ  scores between  20  and  35.  They \ngenerally have  a  mental  age  below  3  1/2  to 4  years  and \nare able  to develop only the bare  rudiments  of speech. \nMany  severely and  profoundly retarded persons  are unable \nto control  their urination or bm-.rel  movements;  highly \naggressive behavior  is very common;  and  such  habits  as \npica  (eating of dirt and other objects)  and  coprophagy, \n(eating of  feces)  are often observed. \n\n- 22  -\n66:  Many  of the St.  Louis State School  and Hospital \nresidents,  including many  of  those who  are not profoundly \nor  severely retarded,  suffer  from  seriously disabling \nphysical handicaps  and  behavioral problems.  Upon  information \nand  belief,  approximately  20%  of all residents have  severe \nhearing or visual  handicaps,  or both;  60%  have  little or no \nverbal  ability,  either as  a  consequence  of their retardation \nor because of a  specific speech disorder;  26%  have  a  gross \nmotor disfunction;  and  38%  have  a  major  convulsive disorder. \nG7 . .  The  care and  treatment of these persons,  while \nminimally .adequate  in many  respects,  now  threatens to \nfall below Constitutional and  statutory standards as \ndefendants'  institute major cutbacks  in funding  for  the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital.  Despite rising \ncosts and  increased demand  for the  services of the \ninstitution,  the  state budget for  fiscal year 1982 \nreduces  funding  for  the St.  Louis  State School  and \nHospital by over 10%.  Additionally,  Defendant Bond \nhas  stated that he will recommend  still further cuts  in \nthe  state budget  for  the  St.  Louis  State School  and \nHospital  and other state-run institutions for  the \nmentally retarded during 1983  and  future years. \n68.  The  impact of the budget cuts  is already \nbeing felt.  Staffing levels have  been reduced in all \nareas.  The  ratio of staff to mentally retarded residents \nhas  been permitted to fall below generally recognized \nminimum  standards,  particularly with respect to  \"direct \ncare\"  staff.  Upon  information and  belief,  the  St.  Louis \nState School  and  Hospital currently provides  less than \n80%  of the direct care staff required by  such  standards. \n69.  Educational,  recreational and  habilitation \nprograms  have  been curtailed.  Fewer  than 10%  of the \nresidents at the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nare eligible to participate in the limited educational \n\n- 23  -\n.\"----' \nprogram of  the  Special  School  District facility at the \ninstitution.  The  programs  available to other residents, \nincluding occupational training,  speech therapy,  and \norganized  recreational activities, have  been  cut back \nsharply due  to  funding  and  staff shortages. \n70.  Buildings at the  institution are not  being \nproperly maintained and  necessary capital improvements \nhave been  cancelled or postponed.  A therapeutic pool, \nbuilt at significant expense  several years  ago,  has  been \nclosed by defendants,  thereby depriving plaintiffs of \nan  essential habilitative activity.  Certain of the \nresidential cottages  fail to comply with applicable health, \nsafety and  fire  regulations.  Many  residents have  been moved \nhaphazardly  from  one  dwelling unit to another,  solely to \naccommodate  a  program of an outside vendor of community \nbased residential services.  Mentally  retarded residents \nare permitted to  smoke  in their living quarters,  thereby \nposing a  serious  safety hazard.  Toilet and  bathing \nfacilities are  inadequate  and  in disrepair.  In  some \nwards,  defendants have  permitted potty chairs to be \nlocated in the midst of  sleeping or  living areas,  causing \na  stench of urine to permeate  such areas. \n71.  Medical  services have  been permitted to \ndeteriorate.  In some  instances  serious  injuries and  ill \nnesses  have  gone  undetected and  untreated for  days. \nMedication  is sometimes  administered  in the wrong dosage, \nat irregular intervals,  and  from pharmaceutical  supplies \nthat bear out-of-date markings.  Medically indicated diets \nfor  retarded persons with  special health needs  are  some \ntimes not prescribed.  In  several recent cases,  inadequate \nservices and  procedures have  caused deterioration in the \nmedical  condition of mentally retarded residents. \n\n- 24  - '---' \n72.  Defendants  have  failed to protect plaintiffs \nfrom physical  harm caused by  self-abuse  and  by  assaults \nfrom other mentally retarded residents.  Such behavior \nis occurring with  increasing  frequency  due  to shortages \nof qualified staff and  inadequate  supervision of  residents. \nPhysical  injuries to plaintiffs include bite wounds, \nlacerations of all types,  concussions,  and broken  ribs \nand  limbs.  Plaintiffs have  received burns  from  live cigarettes. \nMentally  retarded residents are also victims of  rapes  and \nother  sexual  assaults. \n73.  Under  the  guise of  \"normalizing\"  residents,  or \nproviding  \"less restrictive\"  care,  defendants  have  failed \nto adequately  supervise  the  activities of plaintiffs. \nRetarded  residents are  frequently  left unattended  for  long \nperiods of time  or are  given  \"passes\"  that permit them to \nroam  freely on  or off the  State  School  and Hospital  grounds. \nDefendants  have  consistently and  repeatedly over-estimated \nthe  capabilities of plaintiffs,  particularly those plaintiffs \nwho  are  severely or profoundly  retarded and multiply \nhandicapped.  In  so doing,  defendants  have  subjected plain \ntiffs to needless  physical  and psychological abuse  and \ndeterioration in their condition. \nCOMMUNITY-BASED  RESIDENTIAL  FACILITIES \n74.  In  recent years defendants  have  embarked on  a \nprogram of  \"deinstitutionalizing\" the  care of mentally \nretarded persons  in Missouri.  Residents of the  St.  Louis \nState  School  and  Hospital,  including  severely and pro \nfoundly  retarded persons,  are being forced out of  the \ninstitution on  a  wholesale basis  for  placement  in various \n\n- 25  - '--\nnon-institutional residential facilities.  At  the  same  time, \npersons  needing institutional care are being denied  a&~ission \nto the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital  and  are being \nforced  into community  facilities. \n75.  This program is now  accelerating as  part of an \neffort to cut costs by  drastically reducing  the  level \nand quality of  services  for  the mentally retarded.  New \nadmissions  to the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nhave  all but come  to a  halt.  Defendants  have  stated \nthat they will reduce  the number  of  residents at the \nState School  and  Hospital  to  400  by July 1982,  and  that \nadditional  substantial reductions will be made  during the \nbalance of  1982  and  in future years.  Upon  information \nand belief,  defendants'  ultimate objective is to close \ndown  the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital and to move \nall,  or  substantially all, of  its residents  into community \nbased facilities. \n76 •.  By  placing ever increasing numbers  of mentally \nretarded persons  in community  residential facilities,  and \nby  shifting scarce financial  resources  from  institutional \ncare to community-based care,  defendants have  committed \nthemselves  to a  policy of providing inadequate care and \nservices to plaintiffs.  The  types of community  residential \nfacilities  in which plaintiffs have been placed are \ninherently unable  to provide the basic  services that men \ntally retarded persons need  to prevent deterioration in \ntheir condition.  This  is particularly true with respect \nto severely,  profoundly and multiply handicapped retarded \npersons,  who  account  for the vast majority of the residents \nremaining at the  St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital,  and \nwho  defendants  now  propose  to transfer to community-based \nfacilities. \n\n'-....... \n- 26  -\n77.  A  substantial number  of  St.  Louis  State School \nand Hospital  residents who  have  been  transferred from  the \ninstitution have  been placed by  defendants  in privately \nowned  and operated nursing homes.  These  plaintiffs fail \nto  receive adequate  habilitation services,  educational \nprograms,  occupational  therapy,  or other specialized \ntraining.  The  nursing homes  to which  plaintiffs have \nbeen transferred,  generaily located in congested urban \nareas,  provide only custodial care with  little or no \nopportunity for  recreation or other organized activity of \ntherapeutic value.  Plaintiffs confined by  defendants  to \nsuch  failities have  been consigned to an  idle existence \nof wandering  aimlessly through empty  hallways,  watching \ntelevision,  or  lying quietly on  their beds. \n78.  The  boarding  homes,  foster homes  and  group \nhomes  in which defendants  are placing mentally retarded \npersons  are  no  better.  These  community-based  facilities \nare more  restrictive than the  institutions they are \ndesigned  to replace.  The  hostility of  surrounding neigh \nborhoods  effectively confines mentally retarded residents \nto their cramped  urban dwellings.  Moreover,  the  small \nsize of most  such residences precludes  the provision of \nspecialized services that can only be  provided on  an \ninstitutional scale.  Foster homes,  boarding homes  and \ngroup homes  do  not provide on-site medical  staff or \norganized education programs  and other habilitation ser \nvices even  remotely  comparable  to those provided at the \nState School  and  Hospital.  At  best,  these  facilities \nprovide only room  and  board.  Those  residents who  are \nnot  sufficiently high-functioning to travel  to  jobs, \n\n- 27  -\nworkshops  or  other centrally located programs  are  simply \nconfined  to their living quarters to  sit quietly by  them \nselves or watch  television. \n7~.  The  community  facilities to which plaintiffs \nare being transferred operate under contracts with the \nState Department of Mental  Health.  Upon  information and \nbelief,  the  facilities are privately owned  and  most are \noperated on  a  for-profit  basis by  corporations or by \nmarried couples  seeking an  additional  source of  income. \nBecause of these  arrangements,  the interests of the owners  and \noperators of community-based  facilities are often adverse \nto the interests of the  retarded persons  assigned to their \ncare.  To  maximize  profits under the contracts with \nthe  state,  community  facilities have  an  incentive to cut \ncorners on  the more  costly and taxing services that many \nretarded individuals require. \n80.  The  community  facilities  in which plaintiffs \nare being placed  fail to provide qualified staff in \nadequate  nlli~bers.  In most  cases  the  staff of these \nfacilities receive  no  special training.  They  are not \nsubject to public oversight or to any meaningful  system of \ncontrols or accountability.  The  community  facilities also \nsuffer  from  enormous  staff 'turnover.  Upon  information \nand  belief,  the duration of employment  for most  staff \nat such  facilities  is less than one year.  Community  resi \ndential  facilities  are  less desirable places of em~loyment \nthan  large institutions because  they provide no  privacy \nfor  staff members,  ~ay substantially lower  salaries,  and \noffer no  opportunities  for career advancement.  The \nconstant introduction of new  and  untrained employees \n\n- 2g  -\nproduces  an  unstable environment  in which  plaintiffs' \ndevelopment  is impaired.  ~ \n81.  The  shortage of qualified personnel at community \nresidential  facilities has  exposed plaintiffs to a \npattern of neglect and abuse.  Plaintiffs are  frequently \nleft unattended  for  long periods of time.  Plaintiffs \nhave  run  away  from  the residences,  abused  themselves, \nand  become  involved  in violent fights  and  sexual  assaults \nwith other retarded residents.  Upon  information and \nbelief,  a  young  female  resident of a  community  horne  re-\ncently died  from  severe burns  received when  a  staff aide \nleft her unattended  to  take  a  bath.  On  n~~erous other \noccasions  plaintiffs have  suffered serious  injuries,  in-\neluding concussions  and  fractured arms  and  legs.  noreover, \ncorporal  punishment  is frequently  resorted to as  a  con \nvenient means  of  regulating the behavior of mentally  retarded \nresidents,  and  as  a  substitute  for  proper care and treatment. \n82.  By  their increased use  of community-based  facilities, \ndefendants  have  deprived plaintiffs of a  stable and  secure \nliving environment,  free  of the debilitating effects of \ndislocation and  disruption.  As more  and more  plaintiffs \nare moved  out of the St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital \nand  into ill-equipped co~~unity facilities,  the  failure \nrate of these placements  has  risen dramatically.  In case \nafter case,  mentally retarded persons  transferred  from  the \ninstitution and  placed in community  homes  have  had  to be \nremoved  from  such  homes  due  to behavioral  and  adjustment \nproblems.  Plaintiffs who  are discharged  from  the St. \nLouis  State School  and Hospital  for  placement in the \ncommunity  are  rarely,  if ever,  located on  a  permanent \nbasis  in a  community  facility.  Instead,  they  are  shunted \nfrom one  facility  to another,  sometimes  lasting no more \nthan  several days  in particular group or  foster homes. \n\n- 29 -\nThis  instability will only worsen  as  defendants  begin \nto discharge  from  the St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospi-\ntal significant numbers  of the most  seriously disabled \nmentally  retarded persons. \n83.  Defendants'  failure to adequately  regulate and \nmonitor community-based  facilities has  contributed to \nthe  instability of these  facilities.  As  privately owned \nbusinesses,  community  residential  facilities frequently \nencounter  financial  difficulties causing  sharp curtail-\nment  in services or abrupt closings.  Many  plaintiffs \nplaced in nursing homes,  group  homes,  and other resi-\ndential  facilities  have  been  precipitously displaced, \nusually with no  notice  to their families,  because  the \nfacilities have  simply gone  out of business.  The  psycho-\nlogical damage  caused plaintiffs by  this  type  of disrup-\ntion in care has  been devastating  in many  instances. \n84.  In  selecting residents of the St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and Hospital  for  transfer to  community  facilities, \ndefendants  have  failed  to  take  into account  the best \ninterests of  such  residents.  Defendants  have  a  strong \nincentive  to  select  for discharge and  transfer those \nresidents of  the St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital who \nare  not eligible for  Medicaid  assistance.  Under Title \nXIX  of  the Social  Security Administration Act,  the  St. \nLouis  State School  and  Hospital  receives  substantial \nfunds  from  the  federal  government,  but only on  behalf of \nthose  institution residents who  are Medicaid-eligible. \nDefendants  also have  a  strong incentive to select for  dis-\ncharge  and  transfer to community  facilities  those  residents \nof the St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital who  are  18  years \nold or  older and  have  no  legal guardians.  Under  state \nlaw defendants  have  considerable discretion  in decisions \n\n- 30  -\nconcerning the placement of  these  individuals,  but that \ndiscretion is more  circumscribed with  respect  to plain \ntiffs who  are minors  or adults  for whom  legal guardians \nhave  been  appointed.  Upon  information and belief,  in \nreducing  the  resident population of the St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and Hospital,  defendants  are selecting for  dis \ncharge and  placement in community  facilities those plain \ntiffs who  are not Medicaid-eligible and/or  those plain \ntiffs who  are 18  years of age  or older and without court \nappointed  legal guardians. \n85.  Those  residents  of  the St.  Louis  State School \nand  Hospital  selected by  defendants  for  discharge and \ntransfer to community-based  facilities are not given \nadequate preparation for placement.  Defendants  fail to \ngive  adequate  assurance of  readmission  to  the St.  Louis \nState School  and Hospital  for  those  plaintiffs who,  because \nof maladjustment or other problems,  are not placed success \nfully  in community  facilities,  Defendants  also fail  to \nprovide  adequate  follow-up  services to facilitate plaintiffs' \ntransition  from  institutional care to community-based  care \nand  to assure  the  suitability and  appropriateness  of indi \nvidual  community  placements. \n86.  Defendants  have  failed  to promulgate  standards \nwhich  adequately  regulate  the care and  services provided \nto plaintiffs in community-based  residential  facilities, \nand have  failed  to enforce  those  regulations  that have \nbeen promulgated.  Although plaintiffs may  only be  trans \nferred  to community  facilities that have  qualified for \nstate operating licenses,  defendants  have  issued such \nlicenses  routinely to community  facilities  in the \nareas  served by  the St.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital, \nirrespective of whether  such  facilities  comply with \nreasonable  care and  treatment standards.  Further,  faci \nlities that have  received  licenses are not au~qua~ely \n\n- 31  -\n.J \nmonitored by  defendants  to assure continued compliance \nwith defendants'  care and  treatment standards.  Upon \ninformation and belief,  many  of the  community  resi-\ndential  facilities to which plaintiffs have  been trans-\nferred have  never been  subject to follow-up  on-site \ninspection by defendants. \nVI.  CAUSES  OF  ACTION \nCOUNT  I:  Fourteenth Amendment  Claim \n87.  The  aforesaid acts and omissions of defendants \nhave deprived plaintiffs of their rights under  the Four-\nteenth Amendment  to: \n(a}  placement in a  decent,  humane  and \nsecure  living environment; \n(b)  adequate care and  treatment,  including \nnecessary medical  and  habilitation services;  and \n(c)  protection against physical assault \nand  abuse. \nCOUNT  II:  Rehabilitation Act Claim \n88.  The  aforesaid acts and  omissions  of defendants \nhave violated plaintiffs'  rights under  section 504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act,  29  U.S.C.  794  (1980  Supp.},  by  dis-\ncriminating against those members  of the plaintiff class \nwho  are,  have  been,  or may  in the  future be placed in \ninadequate community-based residential facilities,  and by \n~ \ndepriving such persons of the  federally-assisted care and \ntreatment programs made  available at the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and Hospital. \n\n- 32  -\nCOUNT  III:  State Law  Claims \n89.  The  aforesaid acts and omissions  of defendants \ndeprive  plaintiffs of  their rights under  state statute, \nRSHo.  630.005  et seq.  These  include,  but  are not  limited \nto,  the right to: \n(a)  humane  care  and  treatment: \n(b)  to the  extent resources  are available, \nmedical  care and  treatment  in accordance \nwith the highest standards accepted  in medical \npractice; \n(c)  safe  and  sanitary housing; \n(d)  prompt  evaluation and  care,  treatment, \nhabilitation or rehabilitation about which \nthe mentally retarded person  is informed \ninsofar as  he  is capable  of understanding: \n(e)  treatment with dignity as  a  human  being; \n(f)  a  nourishing  and well-balanced  and varied \ndiet;  and \n(g)  freedom  from  verbal  and physical  abuse. \nVII.  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs respectfully request that \nthis Court: \n90.  Appoint  the Parents Association or  designated \nmembers  as  guardians  ad  litem for  all adult residents of the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and Hospital who  have  no  legal \nguardians,  and  for  minors  who  are residents of the \ninstitution and have  no  parents or  legal guardians,  and \nempower  such  guardians  ad  litem to exercise  such residents' \nrights under  state law during the pendency of  this  litigation. \n\n- 33  -\n91.  Preliminarily enjoin defendants  from  continuing \nto transfer residents of the St.  Louis  State School  and \nHospital  to community-based  residential  facilities pending \nthis Court's determination of  the  lawfulness of the  care, \nconditions,  and  treatment provided by  such community \nfacilities. \n92.  Enter  a  final  judgment and order certifying \nthe class of  individuals that plaintiffs represent to include \nall persons who  currently reside at the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and  Hospital,  all persons who  have  resided at the \nSt.  Louis  State School  and  Hospital at any  time  since 1973, \nand  all persons who  may  in the  future  require admission \nto the  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital. \n93.  Permanently enjoin defendants  from  implementing \nfurther  reductions  in the  staff levels and  funding  for \nthe  St.  Louis  State School  and Hospital. \n94.  Declare unconstitutional  and  unlawful  under federal  and \nstate law the conditions,  care and  treatment that defen-\ndants  are providing plaintiffs in the  community-based \nresidential facilities in which plaintiffs have  been placed \nand  are currently being placed. \n95.  Permanently enjoin defendants  from  the continued \nuse  of any  community-based  facilities  failing to provide \nplaintiffs with a  decent and humane  living environment, \nadequate care and  treatment,  and  adequate protection \nagainst physical harm and  abuse. \n9~.  Permanently enjoin defendants  from transferring \nprofoundly retarded,  severely retarded,  and  otherwise \nseriously disabled residents of the  St.  Louis  State \nSchool  and Hospital  to community-based  residential  facilities \nthat do  not provide  care  and  services,  including habilitation \nand medical  services,  at the  same  level  as  such  services \nare provided by  institutional intermediate care facilities \ncomplying  in all respects with applicable Constitutional \nand  statutory requirements. \n\n- 34  -\n97.

Harvie Wilkinson III\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division\nArthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nActing Chief\nSpecial Litigation Section\nNº\nFROM: Wm. Bradford Reynolds\nAssistant Attorney Gener\nCivil Rights Division\nSUBJECT: St. Louis State $chool - Proposed S.10 Intervention\nThe described living conditions at State School leave\nlittle doubt that constitutional standards are not being\nfully satisfied with respect to the residents' basic health\nand safety needs for adequate \"food, clothing, shelter and\nmedical care,\" as required by Youngbeº v. Romeo, 10. S. Ct.\n2452, 2458 (1982). The offensive conditions have, however,\nbeen brought to the attention of the federal court in an action\nbrought on behalf of those residents by very capable counsel.\nThat pending litigation appears to raise all the issues\nthat would be advanced by our intervention. It has focused\nthe State's attention on the deplorable conditions to a\nsufficient degree to prompt corrective measures. There are\napparently practical difficulties working against a quick\nsolution to the current staff-to-resident imbalance, but the\nState seems to be seeking ways to deal better with this, as\nwell as the other, problems.\nMy clear sense is that, in these circumstances, federal\nintervention in the lawsuit is neither compelled nor recommended.\nThe limited resources of the Special Litigation Section\ncounsel against intervening in ongoing lawsuits where plaintiffs\nare adequately represented and have properly framed their\nT\nAPP1,0x\n\n623\nlitigation to raise the relevant constitutional issues. Not\nonly is that the case here, but the State appears to have\ncommenced steps in response to the lawsuit that promise\ntimurpnrovoeudr acottnednittiioonnstoatot8htaetre faScchioliotli.esWneotshoyeutld,inthlietrigefaotrieo,n\nthat are more in need of our assistance.\nIn so concluding, I have not ignored the discussion in\nArt's memorandum that highlights differences between the\nparties as to the proper use of community placement as a\npossible corrective measure. That controversy surfaces in\nmost \"mental institution\" cases and has received considerable\ncommentary on both sides of the issue. As one of several\navailable remedial techniques, community placement is, in my\nview, certainly worthy of the court's consideration. I do\nnot, however, see that the federal government has any particular\ninterest in intervening in the lawsuit to join that debate.\nIn this connection, I repeat yet again that, upon the\nfinding of a constitutional violation, the remedy fashioned\nby the court must be designed to redress the unlawful conditions,\nbut not be so intrusive as to displace the State's fundamental\nresponsibility to manage and operate the mental facilities.\nThis suggests that considerable latitude be given to the State\nto devise appropriate relief that will effectively correct\nthe constitutional wrongs. Whether or not that relief includes\ncommunity placement -- and, if so, to what degree -- is a\nmatter best left to the professional judgment of those State\nofficials most experienced in such matters.\nHere, the State is arguing for more community placement,\nwhile plaintiffs are arguing for less. That dispute will\nundoubtedly be fully aired in court, and the proper balance\nwill presumably be struck on the basis of the unconstitutional\nconditions found to exist and the remedial needs suggested in\norder to cure the situation. Nothing has yet been brought to\nmy attention to indicate that the judicial process will be\nunable to make that determination properly without federal\ninput.\nAccordingly, I decline the invitation to authorize\nintervention in the St. Louis State School litigation. Our\nenergies can be more productively directed at other facilities\nwhere we will not be playing a largely duplicative role, but\nwill rather be taking the initiative on our own to redress\nunconstitutional conditions.",
