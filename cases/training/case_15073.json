The City defendants' application for an extension of time to respond to plaintiffs' first request for the production of documents and first set of interrogatories is granted in part and denied in part. I appreciate that there are multiple deadlines coming up in this matter, but I also appreciate that the Law Department is fortunate to have a large number of talented attorneys. According to its web site, the Law Department has approximately 730 attorneys and 690 \"support professionals\" -- far more professional and paraprofessional personnel than most metropolitan law firms. The City defendants' current application does not disclose how many attorneys it currently has assigned to this matter or nor does it explain why it is unable to assign more attorneys to work on this matter. I conclude that the proposed schedule set forth in plaintiffs' June 8 letter is generally reasonable and adopt it with a slight, 7-day adjustment. The City defendants are to respond to the discovery requests to which they are asserting only general objections no later than July 1, 2016 (a 22-day extension). For those discovery request for which the City defendants do not have general objections, the City defendants are to respond no later than July 21, 2016; to the extent that the City defendants are producing documents in response to plaintiffs' discovery requests, the documents are also to be produced by July 21, 2016.

Any reply papers must be filed by February 16, 2016. Such submissions, if any, should address the issues that the submitter believes are pertinent to preliminary approval, bearing in mind that there will be an opportunity for opposition submissions in connection with final approval. City Defendants' request for postponement of their time to respond to the Complaint is denied, as is their request for a blanket stay of discovery concerning the claims against them and of the motion practice concerning the proposed settlement with the State Defendants. The scheduled approved by the Court's January 19, 2016, letter endorsement (Docket Entry No. 94) remains in effect. This Order resolves Docket Entry Numbers 102 and 104. SO ORDERED.

P. 30(b)(3) and (b)(4), that all depositions in this action may be taken via telephone, videoconference, or other remote means, and may be recorded by any reliable audio or audiovisual means. This order does not dispense with the requirements set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(5), including the requirement that (\"[u]nless the parties stipulate otherwise\") the deposition be \"conducted before an officer appointed or designated under Rule 28,\" and that the deponent be placed under oath by that officer. For avoidance of doubt, however, a deposition will be deemed to have been conducted \"before\" an officer so long as that officer attends the deposition via the same remote means (e.g., telephone conference call or video conference) used to connect all other remote participants, and so long as all participants (including the officer) can clearly hear and be heard by all other participants. It is further ORDERED, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4), that all unexpired deadlines for the completion of fact depositions, fact discovery, expert depositions, expert discovery, and/or all discovery are hereby EXTENDED for a period of 30 days, together with all post-discovery deadlines previously set by this Court. Nothing in this Order prevents the parties from seeking to further modify the pretrial schedule in this action in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (or for any other good cause). Prior to seeking such relief, the parties must, as always, meet and confer (via remote means) in a good faith effort to reach agreement on how best to fulfil the goals of Rule 1 while avoiding unnecessary health risks. On receipt of this order, each party is directed to ensure that all other parties in this action are aware of the order, particularly if this action involves a pro se party. SO ORDERED.

CVfiled by The City of New York. It goes without saying that any allegations regarding potential harm to children in foster care are of grave concern. The question here, however, is whether the named Plaintiffs have met their burden to demonstrate (among other things) that there are questions of law or fact common to a class of all children who are or will be in the foster care system of New York City, and that the named Plaintiffs are typical representatives of such a broad class. Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not offered sufficient evidence to satisfy that burden, the motion for class certification is denied. By September 13, 2021, the parties must file a joint letter addressing the next steps in this litigation. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 504, 511, and 515. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Kimba M. Wood on 9/03/2021) (ama) (Entered: 09/03/2021)"

Among other things, it is not clear to me to whom notice should be provided nor is it clear how objections should be received. Presumably, objections and opt-out notices must be submitted in a manner that preserves the anonymity of infant class members. Counsel are directed to confer concerning these issues (and any other related issues) and to submit a joint letter to me concerning these matters no later than November 16, 2015. If the parties are unable to agree on a joint proposal, the joint letter should contain each side's proposal. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman on 10/30/2015) (kgo) (Entered: 10/30/2015)"

          "description": "ORDER denying 260 Letter Motion to Stay. The City Defendants' application to stay discovery is denied. Judge Swain's comments concerning the adequacy of plaintiffs' counsel's investigation of the particular circumstances of the named plaintiff children and counsel's assessment of the named plaintiff children's claims were all made in the context of the motion to approve the settlement with the State Defendants and, in particular, were addressing the issue of whether the settlement was reached after meaningful discovery. Judge Swain was not asked to address whether \"the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions [in the amended complaint were] warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law\" or whether \"the factual contentions [in the amended complaint] have evidentiary support or.. will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery....\" Fed.R.Civ. P. 11 (b) (2), (3). In short, Judge Swain was not assessing whether there was a violation of the Rule 11(b)'s implied certifications, and the City Defendants' attempt to contort her words into a finding of a Rule 11 violation divorces the words from the context in which they were made. Whether counsel's discovery and investigation is sufficient to justify approval of a class action settlement is a different, more demanding inquiry than whether counsel's pre-suit investigation satisfied Rule 11. It is also noteworthy that the City Defendants, who have substantial knowledge of the named plaintiff children's circumstances and the allegations made in the amended complaint, have never even suggested that the amended complaint was so baseless that Rule 11 sanctions were warranted. The fact that the City Defendants never commenced the procedures set forth in Rule 11(c) that must precede a motion for Rule 11 sanctions casts doubt on the veracity of their newly asserted arguments. I appreciate that the City Defendants deny plaintiffs' material allegations. Nevertheless, in the absence of a showing that the allegations in the amended complaint were asserted in bad faith and were utterly baseless in law and fact, there is no basis for the stay of discovery sought by the City Defendants. The annexed application is, therefore, denied. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman on 8/16/2016) Copies Sent By Chambers. (lmb) (Entered: 08/17/2016)"

This order is without prejudice to an application from plaintiffs to take additional depositions or to an application from a defendant for a protective order with respect to a particular deposition or depositions. 2. Provided that plaintiffs include proposed search terms in their document requests, the parties shall meet and confer concerning search terms within 30 days of the date on which a document request is served. 3. In an effort to ensure the prompt resolution of any discovery disputes that may arise in this matter, monthly discovery conferences will be held commencing on August 10, 2017 and at four-week intervals thereafter, i.e. September 7, 2017, October 5, 2017, November 2, 2017, etc. The conferences will commence at 3:00 p.m. Any party wishing to raise an issue at the conference is directed to file a letter describing the issue on the ECF system by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday preceding the conference; such letters shall be limited to a maximum of 1500 words in length and shall include a representation that counsel has had a viva voce conversation -- not merely an exchange of correspondence, emails or faxes -- with the adverse party in a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute without my intervention. Opposition letters shall not be submitted. If no letters are filed prior to the date of a scheduled conference, I shall assume that no discovery issues currently exist and that there is no need for a conference at that time. This Order does not preclude any party from seeking discovery conferences in addition to the regularly scheduled Thursday conferences. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman on 7/21/2017) (rj) (Entered: 07/24/2017)"

Named Plaintiff Children's request to file under seal certain excerpts of 30(b)(6) depositions of certain third-party agencies (the \"Contract Agencies\") is granted temporarily until August 14, 2019, by which date either the Named Plaintiff Children or the Contract Agencies must file a letter motion on ECF seeking leave for the continued sealing of these excerpts. The letter motion, which may be redacted if necessary, must identify any relevant provisions of the Second Amended Protective Order (docket entry no. 391), justify the request in light of the standards set forth in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 11920 (2d Cir. 2006), and state whether the request is on consent and, if not, the substance of any opposing position(s). Unredacted courtesy copies of the letter motion and relevant deposition excerpts with all proposed redactions in highlighted form must be provided to Chambers. If no timely request seeking leave for continued sealing is filed, the excerpts shall be unsealed without further notice. Named Plaintiff Children are directed to serve a copy of this order upon the Contract Agencies no later than July 31, 2019. This Order resolves docket entry no. 437. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Laura Taylor Swain on 7/30/2019) (ama) (Entered: 07/30/2019)"

The third-party agencies must file no later than September 20, 2019, a submission (1) explaining the specific deposition testimony they seek to file under seal, (2) demonstrating why that testimony will \"cause embarrassment and harm,\" \"damage [the agencies'] relationship with ACS,\" or \"damage the trust and security the families have in their foster services,\" and (3) describing how continued sealing or redaction is necessary to preserve higher values beyond the third-party agencies' mere desire not to disclose this information to the public. To the extent that the agencies contend that the supplemental explanatory material includes material that itself meets the high standard for sealing or protection, the statement may be filed on ECF in redacted form with the unredacted version delivered for chambers and served on Named Plaintiff Children. The Court will review and rule on whether that material may remain sealed in conjunction with its ruling on whether the deposition excerpts that are the subject of the Named Plaintiff Childrens application may remain sealed. The temporary sealing of the deposition excerpts is hereby continued until September 23, 2019. If no timely supplemental submission is filed, the excerpts shall be unsealed without further notice. Named Plaintiff Children are directed to serve a copy of this Order upon CHFS and HSVS, and to file a certificate attesting to such service, no later than September 12, 2019. And as set forth herein.

The named plaintiffs moved to represent a class of all children who are now or will be in the foster care custody of the Commissioner of New York City's Administration for Childrens Services and two subclasses. As remedies, they sought injunctive and declaratory relief to redress alleged class-wide injuries caused by deficiencies in the City's administrationand the New York State Office of Children and Family Services' oversightof foster care. The district court (Kimba M. Wood, J.) denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the district court erred in its analysis of the commonality and typicality requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and that remand is required for reconsideration of class certification under the correct legal standard. We agree. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court's order denying class certification and REMAND the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion..

    "summary": "<p>On July 8, 2015, a group of ten children in the foster care system and the Public Advocate of New York filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by private counsel, nonprofit advocacy organization A Better Childhood, and the office of the New York Public Advocate, the plaintiffs brought this action against New York City, the New York City Administration for Children Services (ACS), New York State, and the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS), under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. The case was assigned to Judge Laura Taylor Swain.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged violations of the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq., common law contractual claims, and state social services laws on timely and adequate provision of adoption and foster case management services. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants caused irreparable harm to the plaintiffs by their failure to protect the children in ACS custody from maltreatment, to provide the children with permanent homes and families within a reasonable time, and to provide foster placements and services that ensure the well-being of the children. The complaint also alleged that the defendants failed to remedy the systemic deficiencies plaguing NYC’s child welfare system by the city defendants’ failure to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over contract agencies; the defendants’ failure to ensure an adequately staffed and appropriately trained child welfare workforce, to address deficiency in the processes to make improvements foster placements in NYC, to ensure meaningful case plans and service plans for foster children are developed and implemented, and to ensure timely adjudication of family court proceedings. </p><p>The plaintiffs also moved for class certification along with the complaint. The case proceeded with discovery under U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman. </p><p>On October 20, 2015, the state defendants filed a proposed settlement agreement with the court, requiring a more rigorous monitoring of the city foster care system. The proposed settlement required OFCS to hire a monitor and a research expert to review and assess the operations of NYC Foster Care system including the placement process, the cause of maltreatment of children, the availability and appropriateness of services, and the recruitment of an appropriate and sufficient array of placements for children in the foster care system. </p><p>The monitor would submit quarterly reports to the OCFS who, with ACS, would determine actions necessary to address any findings. The research expert would conduct annual reviews of case record samples of children in the custody of ACS to determine compliance with state and federal laws. If the expert found substantial non-compliance, the expert would write a written individual case report which will be shared with ACS and OCFS who would then be required to work with the voluntary agency in breach of the law to conduct a corrective action. For any corrective action plans, ACS would report to OCFS on a quarterly basis on the status and follow-up measures. </p><p>The settlement was not approved for several months due to procedural complications, including the required fairness hearing. Both the city defendants and various organizations that represent foster children in the family court objected to the settlement, although neither were parties to the action. The city attempted unsuccessfully to have the court stay all proceedings in the case, including the approval of the settlement agreement with the state.</p><p>On April 22, 2016, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain entered an order to preliminarily approve the consent decree subject to the rights of individual class members to challenge the settlement agreement and to show why a final judgment dismissing this case against State Defendants should not be entered following a fairness hearing. In the same opinion, the court conditionally certified the class for purposes of providing notice, but the formal class certification is pending.</p><p>On July 12, 2016, the court granted Parent Advocates and Children's Advocates motion to intervene. 2016 WL 3960558.</p><p>On August 12, 2016, the magistrate judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for final approval of the settlement and vacated the conditional certification of the class. 2016 WL 4367969. First, the judge held that the settlement lacked procedural fairness, because the settlement was drafted a week after the complaint was filed in the absence of any meaningful discovery into the merits of the claims. Second, the court held that the settlement would not save much expense of the litigation, because even if the settlement with the State defendants was approved, the plaintiffs had to continue the litigation with the City defendants. Third, the court heavily weighed on the intervenors' concerns that the consent decree had inadequate provisions. The intervenors expressed their concerns about the consent decree that the roles and objectives of the Research Expert and Monitor were vague, remedies did not address the alleged civil rights violations, and the seven-year covenant not to sue is unprecedented in its duration. Lastly, the judge held that the corrective actions defined in the Consent Decree were not specific enough and therefore the plaintiffs would be able to gain more robust remedies if they were to prevail at trial. </p><p>On September 12, 2016, the district court granted the city defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' AACWA claims premised on 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(10) and 671(a)(22), statutes regulating the state plan for foster care and adoption assistance. In the same opinion and order, the judge dismissed claims asserted against ACS and Commissioner Carrion, without prejudice to the litigation of those claims as against the Defendant City. 2016 WL 4750178.</p><p>On September 27, 2016, Judge Swain denied class certification without prejudice to renewal. She held that here, the request for class certification failed to meet commonality, typicality, and adequate representation. Namely, Judge Swain held that the consistency of plaintiffs’ broad assertions in the amended complaint were questionable in that problems (such as mental health issues, undue length of time in foster care, and lack of successful resolution of obstacles to family reunification) are attributable to faulty management and oversight of the foster care system. Therefore, she held that certification of a broad unitary class of children who are or will be in foster care was not appropriate. </p><p>On November 16, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the case was moot as to six of the nineteen plaintiffs who had since left foster care since those six plaintiffs no longer had a basis to assert claims for equitable relief. On January 25, 2017, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the State of New York and the New York State OCFS from the case.</p><p>On July 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification. The motion has yet to be decided and the case remains pending as of April 15, 2021.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Ten children abused and neglected during their time in New York City's foster care system sued City and State defendants. The plaintiffs' allegations against ACS for its failure to exercise proper oversight over the voluntary foster care agencies were based on state, federal, and constitutional claims. The proposed settlement required OCFS to hire a monitor and a research expert to implement a systemic reform in NYC foster care system. But the City defendants and organizations that represent foster children in the Family Court have objected to the settlement and the city has tried unsuccessfully to have the court stay all proceedings in the case. In April, 2016, the court entered an order to preliminarily approve the settlement, but in August 2016, the court rejected the settlement. In September, the court dismissed the AACWA claims premised on 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(10) and 671(a)(22) and the claims asserted against ACS and Commissioner Carrion, without prejudice to the litigation of those claims as against the Defendant City. Subsequently, the court denied class certification without prejudice to renewal, calling into question the reliability of the facts asserted in the amended complaint were attributable to faulty management of the foster care system. As of April 15, 2021, the case remains ongoing and is pending class certification.",

Plaintiffs assert claims under the First, Ninth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; the Adoption Assistance and Child\nWelfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. (the “AACWA”) (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n(“Section 1983”)); the New York State Social Services Law; and common law contract law\nagainst the City of New York (the “City”), the New York City Administration for Children’s\nServices (“ACS”), ACS Commissioner Gladys Carrion (“Carrion” and, together with the City\nand ACS, the “City Defendants”),1 the New York State Office of Children and Family Services\n(“OCFS”) and OCFS Acting Commissioner Sheila J.

They\nassert constitutional and federal and state statutory claims, including claims under 42 U.S.C.\nsection 1983 to enforce rights purportedly established by certain provisions of the AACWA.\nThe City Defendants now move: (1) to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6), all of Plaintiffs’ claims brought under the AACWA; (2) to dismiss the\nclaims of Plaintiff James, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure to\nstate a claim and, alternatively, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17, on the basis of\nlack of capacity to sue; and (3) to dismiss the action as against Carrion and ACS because they\nare non-suable entities.  (See generally Docket Entry No. 115, City Defendants’ Memorandum of\nLaw in Support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Letitia James, Defendants ACS and Gladys\nCarrion and All Claims Brought Under the AACWA (“City Def.

(See Docket Entry No. 119, Memorandum of Law in Opposition to City\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss (“Pl. Children Opp.”) and Docket Entry No. 120, Memorandum\nof Law in Opposition to City Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.)\nThe Court has reviewed carefully all of the parties’ submissions.  For the reasons\nstated and as explained below, the City Defendants’ motion is granted in part and denied in part.\nDISCUSSION\nWhen deciding a motion brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6) to dismiss a complaint, courts “must accept as true all of the factual allegations set out\nin the Plaintiff’s complaint, draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to\nthe Plaintiff, and construe the complaint liberally.”  Roth v. Jennings, 489 F.3d 499, 510 (2d Cir.\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 4\n\n2007).  In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n(2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to\ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556\nU.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 566).  If the plaintiffs have not “nudged their claims\nacross the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.”  Twombly,\n550 U.S. at 570.  \nHere, the City’s arguments go the legal viability of Plaintiffs’ claims rather than\nthe factual sufficiency of the Amended Complaint.  In particular, they assert that there are no\nprivate rights of action created under the AACWA provisions upon which Plaintiffs rely, and\nthat New York law precludes the assertion of claims against ACS and its Commissioner\n(requiring, instead, that claims be asserted against the City).  Such arguments are properly\nconsidered in the context of motion practice under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Fair v. Verizon Comm’ns,\nInc. 621 F. App’x 52, 53 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (“Determinations that a federal statute\ndoes not provide a private right of action are typically subject to dismissal under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) . . . for failure to state a claim.”); Republic of Iraq v. ABB AG, 678\nF.3d 145, 171 (2d Cir. 2014) (affirming district court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of claim\non grounds that Foreign Corrupt Practices Act does not provide a private right of action); Gupta\nv. Headstrong, Inc., No. 12 CV 6652-RA, 2013 WL 4710388, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2013)\n(“Gupta’s complaint must also be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) because there is no private right of action until administrative\nremedies have been exhausted.”).\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 5\n\nPrivate Right of Action Under the AACWA\nThe City Defendants move to dismiss all of the Plaintiffs’ AACWA claims,\narguing that the statute does not confer a private right of action.  Invoking Section 1983,\nPlaintiffs assert numerous claims in their Third Cause of Action that are rooted, variously, in\nsections 671(a)(10), 671(a)(16), 617(a)(22), 675(1), and 675(5) of the AAWCA.  None of the\ncited sections makes explicit provision for any private right of action.  Plaintiffs contend,\nhowever, that they create federal statutory rights that are enforceable as against the defendant\nstate and municipal authorities through Section 1983.\nIn Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980), the Supreme Court held that Section\n1983 protects certain rights that are conferred by federal statutes.  See Blessing v. Freestone, 520\nU.S. 329, 340 (1997).  A plaintiff asserting a statute-based Section 1983 claim “must assert the\nviolation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”  Id.  “To determine whether a\nfederal statute creates a privately enforceable right, courts must consider three factors: (1)\n‘Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff’; (2) ‘the\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and\namorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence’; and (3) ‘the statute must\nunambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States.’”  Walker v. Eggleston, No. 04 CV\n369-WHP, 2005 WL 639584, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2005) (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at\n340-41); see also Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002) (“A court’s role in discerning\nwhether personal rights exist in the § 1983 context . . . require[s] a determination as to whether\nor not Congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries.”).  “In\ndetermining whether a private right of action exists, ‘the ultimate issue is whether Congress\nintended to create a private cause of action.’” Gupta, 2013 WL 4170388, at *4 (quoting\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 6\n\nCalifornia v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 293 (1981)).\n“Even if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right,\nthere is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under [Section] 1983.” \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341.  “[D]ismissal is proper if Congress ‘specifically foreclosed’ a remedy\nunder [Section] 1983\" by expressly precluding Section 1983 claims or by creating “a\ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under\n[Section] 1983\" and thus impliedly foreclosing claims under that provision.  Id. (citations\nomitted). \nIt is insufficient for a Section 1983 plaintiff to assert generally that a particular\nstatute creates enforceable rights.  Rather, plaintiffs must “identify with particularity” the claims\nrights, so that the court can “ascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various criteria”\nthat the Supreme Court has identified as determinative of “whether a federal statute creates\nrights.”  Id.  The Blessing Court cited three of its prior decisions as instructive in this regard.  In\nWright v. City of Roanoke Redev. and Housing Auth., 479 U.S. 418 (1987), the Court upheld the\nlower court’s determination that a particular provision of a public housing statute limiting “rent”\nto a specified proportion of the tenant’s income conferred a right on individual tenants: the\nstatute specified a particular percentage of income that could be charged as rent in language that\nwas “mandatory . . . [and] focus[ed] on the individual family and its income.”  Id. at 430. \nLanguage requiring that a “reasonable” allowance for utilities be included in the rent cap was not\ntoo vague to confer a right, in that regulations established guidelines and a notice and comment\nprocedure for setting the allowances.  Id. at 431.  Private enforcement of the right was not\nforeclosed by provisions vesting a federal agency with power to conduct audits and cut off\npublic housing authority funding in the event of violations.  Id. at 428-29.  \nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 7\n\nIn Wright v. Wilder, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), also cited in Blessing, the Court held\nthat a provision of the Medicaid statute requiring that providers be reimbursed “according to\nrates that a ‘State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable and\nadequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated\nfacilities’” created a right enforceable by providers in Section 1983 actions.   Id. at 501. \nCongressional intent to benefit health care providers was indicated by reimbursement provision\nlanguage specifically referring to such providers, id. at 510; language specifying that\nreimbursement at the targeted rates “must” be provided for by a required state plan at the risk of\nwithholding of federal funding was found to be sufficient to constitute a mandate, rather than\nmerely precatory, id. at 512; and pre-existing precedent recognized the existence of a private\nright of action for injunctive relief requiring proper reimbursement, id. at 517-518.\nIn Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992), by contrast, the Court rejected a\ncontention that a subdivision of the AACWA created privately enforceable right to “reasonable\nefforts . . . to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and . . . to\nmake it possible for the child to return to his home .”  Id. at 358 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 671(a)(15)).  This AACWA provision, which appears in a portion of one of the subdivisions\nupon which Plaintiffs rely in this case, requires a state seeking federal foster care and adoption\nservices to have in place certain plans with respect to foster care administration, and requires that\nplan comprise certain features, including a provision requiring the above-referenced “reasonable\nefforts.”   The Court found the reference to “reasonable efforts” one as to which the statute\nprovided no guidance, leaving the determination of how to comply up to the states, and that it\nthus did not unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon individual beneficiaries of the\nAACWA.  Id. at 362-63.  Under those circumstances, and in light of the Court’s conclusions that\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 8\n\nthe statutory mandate directed to the states dealt with eligibility for funding and “goes only so\nfar as to ensure that the State have a plan approved by the Secretary which contains the 16 listed\nfeatures” and that the statute contained sufficient administrative enforcement measures to ensure\nthe “reasonable efforts” provision’s vitality, no private right of action seeking “reasonable\nefforts” was created.  Id. at 358-61.  Following the Suter decision, Congress enacted a statute,\ncolloquially referred to as the “Suter fix”, that directed that in an action brought to enforce a\nprovision of the laws governing Social Security (of which the AACWA is a part), the provision\n“is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section . . . requiring a State plan\nor specifying the required contents of a State plan,” but also provided that the new statute was\n“not intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the availability of private actions to\nenforce State plan requirements other than by overturning any such grounds applied in Suter . . .\nbut not applied in prior Supreme Court decisions respecting such enforceability.”  The statute\nfurther provides that it was not intended to alter Suter’s holding “that section 671(a)(15) of [the\nAACWA] is not enforceable in a private action.”  42 U.S.C.S. § 1320a-2 (LexisNexis 2008). \nSuter therefore remains instructive as to the construction of the language of specific provisions\nof section 671(a) in connection with the assertion of individually enforceable rights thereunder. \nThe lower courts have reached varying determinations as to private enforceability of numerous\nprovisions of the AAWCA, and the Second Circuit precedent regarding the claims that are\nasserted in the Amended Complaint is likewise ambiguous.  The Court now turns to the claims\nasserted by Plaintiffs pursuant to Section 1983 and the AACWA.\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) – Right to Foster Placement that Conforms to Nationally\nRecommended Standards                                                                                       \nIn paragraph 348(a) of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that the\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 9\n\nDefendants have violated a right, conferred on them by Section 671(a)(10), to “placement in a\nfoster placement that conforms to nationally recommended professional standards.”  Section\n671(a) requires that, “[i]n order for a State to be eligible for [federal foster care and adoption\npayments] . . ., it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary” that has specified features,\nincluding:\n(10) provi[sion] (A) for the establishment or designation of a State\nauthority or authorities that shall be responsible for establishing\nand maintaining standards for foster family homes and child care\ninstitutions which are reasonably in accord with recommended\nstandards of national organizations concerned with standards for\nthe institutions or homes . . . .\n42 U.S.C.S. § 671(a) (LexisNexis 2008).  The subdivision goes on to require the State to apply\nthe referenced standards to foster family homes and child care institutions receiving funding, and\nthat the standards include certain caregiver liability provisions.  It also includes limitations on\nwaivers of the standards.  Id.\nThe first step in the three-part Blessing analysis is to examine whether the\nstatutory section indicates Congressional intent to benefit the individual plaintiff.  520 U.S. at\n340.  While the purpose of foster care and adoption arrangements, and standards relating thereto,\nis obviously to provide quality care for children in foster care, this particular subdivision is not\nfocused on individual child placements.  Rather, its focus is systemic, requiring a state to\nestablish or designate an authority that is then given the responsibility of developing standards\nby reference to certain benchmarks, and to apply those state-determined standards to homes and\ninstitutions receiving funding.  The indirect, albeit very important, benefit to children in foster\ncare placement that accrues from proper compliance with the standard-setting mandate to the\nstate is, in this Court’s view, insufficient to indicate a Congressional intent to confer a right,\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 10\n\ndirectly enforceable by individual foster care beneficiaries, to the establishment of standards that\n“conform to nationally recommended professional standards.”  (Cf. Amended Complaint\n¶ 348(a).)  Indeed, the statutory mandate to the State standard developers is also less definitive\nthan Plaintiff’s asserted right – state authorities are commanded to develop standards “which are\nreasonably in accord with recommended standards of national organizations concerned with\nstandards for the institutions or homes.”  The statute leaves it to the state authority to identify the\nreference organizations and to determine what will “reasonably . . . accord” with the reference\norganizations’ standards.  In this respect, the statutory language is similar to that at issue in\nSuter, which called for “reasonable efforts”, and unlike the language found to create a right in\nWright, which provided a specific benchmark for cost reimbursement determinations and\nrequired affirmative State assurance that the reimbursement levels were consonant with the\nbenchmark.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 358-61; Wright, 496 U.S. at 509-512.\nThe Court therefore concludes that no individually enforceable right to foster care\nstandards is created by 42 U.S.C. section 671(a)(10) and that the Amended Complaint fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted insofar as it seeks relief pursuant to Section 1983\npremised on such a right.  (See Amended Complaint ¶ 348(a).)\n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A) - Right to Written Case Plan That Includes a Plan to\nProvide Safe, Appropriate and Stable Foster Care Placements                                         \nParagraph 348(b) of the Amended Complaint seeks enforcement of the captioned\nright, as derived from subdivision (a)(16) of section 671 and 42 U.S.C. section 675(1), which is a\ndefinitional provision of the statute.  Section 671(a)(16) requires that the mandated State plan: \nprovide[] for the development of a case plan (as defined in section\n671(a) of this title . . .) for each child receiving foster care\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 11\n\nmaintenance payments under the State plan and provide[] for a\ncase review system which meets the requirements described in\nsections 675(5) and 675a of this title with respect to each child.\n42 U.S.C.S. § 671(a)(16) (LexisNexis 2008).  Section 675(1) defines “case plan” and sets forth\nextensive specific content requirements for the plan, including requirements of descriptions of\nthe type of placement, discussions of the safety and propriety of the placement and the\nresponsible agency’s plan for carrying out the relevant placement agreement or judicial\ndetermination, inclusion of a plan for assuring that the child receives “safe and proper care” and\nthat services are provided to the parties in interest to facilitate return of the child to the home or\npermanent placement, and discussion of the “appropriateness” of the services that are being\nprovided.  The plan must also include the child’s health and educational records, a written\ndescription of transition plans for older children, and documentation of the steps the agency is\ntaking to find an appropriate permanent living arrangement for the child. “A plan for ensuring\nthe educational stability of the child while in foster care” is another required component of the\n“case plan.”  42 U.S.C.S. § 671(1) (LexisNexis 2008).\nThe written case plan requirement of section 671(a)(16) is specifically directed to\nfulfillment with respect to “each child receiving foster care maintenance payment.”  Such\nchildren are, therefore, unquestionably the intended beneficiaries of the case plan requirement,\nwhich meets the first prong of the Blessing test.  The second prong of the test is also satisfied in\nthat the right “is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its enforcement would strain judicial\ncompetence.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341-42.  Section 675(1), whose requirements are\nincorporated by reference into section 671(a)(16), provides specific plan content requirements. \nThe statutory language is also mandatory, not precatory, in that it requires the creation of a\nwritten plan for “each child.”  See id. at 342.  Section 671(a)(16) thus indicates that Congress\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 12\n\nintended to create a right for each child receiving foster care payments to be the subject of a\nwritten care plan, and a rebuttable presumption arises that the right is enforceable under Section\n1983.  Id.  The Court thus turns to whether there is any indication that Congress specifically\nforeclosed such a remedy, and finds no such indication.  The AACWA contains no express\npreclusion of the Section 1983 remedy.  Nor is it implicitly foreclosed.  There is no\ncomprehensive scheme that would be incompatible with individual enforcement under Section\n1983.  Furthermore, although Congress has explicitly provided for a private right of action with\nrespect to one other subdivision of Section 671 – Section 671(a)(18), relating to discrimination\nin foster care placements – that remedy is broader than the Section 1983 remedy in that it\npermits actions against the State and is not limited to claims against persons acting under color\nof state law, so it carries no implication that Congress intended to preclude resort to the narrower\nSection 1983 remedial route for enforcement of any rights that are created by other provisions of\nSection 671.  See 42 U.S.C.S. § 674(d)(3) (LexisNexis 2008) (providing private right of action to\n“any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of Section 671(a)(18) of this title by a State or\nother entity”).3  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently reached this\nsame conclusion in Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1006-08 (9th Cir. 2012).\nThe City’s motion is therefore denied with respect to the AAWCA case plan\n3 The Court recognizes that, in Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 489\n(D.N.J. 2000), the court found that the section 674(d)(3) private action provision\nwas “strong evidence that Congress did not intend th[e] other various State plan\nelements in Section 671(a) to confer rights enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.  The Charlie H. Court did not, however, recognize the difference in scope\nbetween Section 1983 and the AAWCA private action provision.  See id.\n(“Congress recently chose to amend 42 U.S.C. § 674 to include a private right of\naction under § 1983 for a state or other entity’s failure to comply with 42 U.S.C.\n§ 671(a)(18).”)\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 13\n\nclaim asserted in paragraph 348(b) of the Amended Complaint insofar as Plaintiffs seek to\nenforce a right to the preparation of a written case plan meeting the specifications set forth in 42\nU.S.C. § 675(1).\n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A) - Right to Written Case Plan that Ensures that the\nChild Receives Safe and Proper Care While in Foster Care and Implementation of that\nPlan                                                                                                                                    \nIn paragraph 348(c) of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert a different sort\nof written plan claim based on the same provisions of the AAWCA.  Here, Plaintiffs assert that\nthe written case plan provisions establish an individually enforceable right to implementation of\na written plan that ensures safe and appropriate outcomes.  The Court finds that the statute\nconfers no such rights.  As shown above, section 671(a)(16) is phrased strictly in terms of the\nrequirement of a plan.  Section 675(1) specifies the required content of the plan, and is phrased\nlargely in terms of requiring “discussion” of safety, placement propriety and other issues, and of\n“design” to meet certain goals or outcomes.  See 42 U.S.C. § 675(1).   While it is of course to be\nexpected that a plan will be implemented, nothing in the statutory language specifically requires\nimplementation or achievement of all of the particulars of the plan, much less successful\nachievement of outcomes.  Rather, the plan principally serves notice and accountability\nfunctions in aid of reviews of goals, services and outcomes.  Unlike the Medicaid reimbursement\nformula considered by the Supreme Court in Wright, the State is not required to make\naffirmative representations that the elements of the written plan meet particular standards or\ngoals.  See Wright, 496 U.S. at 514-15 (rejecting argument that findings and assurance\nrequirements are purely procedural – “the only plausible interpretation of the [statute] is that by\nrequiring a State to find that its rates are reasonable and adequate, the statute imposes the\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 14\n\nconcomitant obligation to adopt reasonable and adequate rates.”)  \nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that Congress created the privately enforceable\nright described in paragraph 348(c) of the Amended Complaint; the City’s motion will therefore\nbe granted to the extent it seeks dismissal of the Plaintiff’s claims premised on the right\ndescribed in paragraph 348(c).\n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B),(E),(G) - Rights to Written Case Plan Ensuring\nReunification Services to Families or Permanent Placement, Ensuring Location of\nPermanent Home and Implementation of Plan, and Ensuring Educational Stability while\nin Foster Care and Implementation of Plan                                                                           \nFor substantially the reasons explained in the foregoing paragraph, Plaintiffs’\nclaims of individually enforceable substantive rights to implementation of particular plan\nprovisions and particular outcomes are not supported by the language of the cited statutory\nprovisions and, thus, fail to state claims upon which relief may be granted under Section 1983.\nThe City’s motion is therefore granted to the extent it seeks dismissal of\nPlaintiffs’ AAWCA claims set forth in paragraphs 348(d)-(f) of the Amended Complaint.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A),(B),(C),(E) - Rights to Case Review System in\nWhich Each Child has a Case Plan Designed to Achieve Safe and Appropriate Foster\nCare Placements, in Which Case Status of Child Is Reviewed at Least Every Six Months,\nand that Ensures that State Files Parental Rights Termination Petition for Each Child\nWho has Been in Foster Care for 15 of the Most Recent 22 Months and Concurrently\nIdentifies, Recruits, Processes and Approves Adoption Family                                           \nThe second clause of Section 671(a)(16) requires the State to have a plan that\n“provides for a case review system which meets the requirements described in sections 675(5)\n. . . with respect to each child” receiving foster care payments.  42 U.S.C.S § 671(a)(16)\n(LexisNexis 2008).  Section 675(5) defines “case review system” as “a procedure for assuring\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 15\n\nthat,” inter alia, “each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in a safe setting” that\nmeets certain criteria, “the status of each child is reviewed periodically but no less frequently\nthan once every six months by either a court or by administrative review,” procedural safeguards\nare applied to permanency plan hearings held every 12 months for children in foster care, and\nthat, with enumerated exceptions, in the case of a child who has been in foster care for 15 of the\nmost recent 22 months, the state will file a petition to terminate parental rights and concurrently\nidentify, recruit, process and approve a qualified family for adoption. 42 U.S.C.S. § 675(5)\n(LexisNexis 2008) (emphasis supplied).  Plaintiffs’ claims of rights as set forth in paragraphs\n348(h) to (i) are generally consistent with the statutory provisions on which they rely.  Although\nthe provisions speak in terms of a “system” and “procedures,” they require that such system and\nprocedures “assur[e]” that “each child” have a case plan designed to achieve placement in a\n“safe setting” that is “least restrictive” and “most appropriate,” and further assure periodic\nreviews by courts or administrative bodies of particular aspects of their foster care status.  42\nU.S.C.S. § 675(5)(A),(B),(C) (LexisNexis 2008).  Section 675(5)(E) similarly requires that the\nprocedure assure the commencement of termination of parental rights proceedings and\nconcurrent adoption placement activity for children who have been in care for a specified period\nof time, unless specific exceptions are satisfied.  The language that Congress has used indicates\nan intention that each child whose care is subject to the statutorily-mandated plan benefit from\nthese features of the required system and is mandatory insofar as it requires particular structures\nand timetables.  Nor are the provisions, which specify goals to be addressed in plan design and\nproceedings to occur before specified tribunals too vague and amorphous as to strain judicial\ncompetence.  See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-41.  As explained above, the AAWCA does not\nestablish any comprehensive enforcement system that is incompatible with individual\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 16\n\nenforcement of these provisions under Section 1983, and Congress has not expressly foreclosed\nprivate enforcement under Section 1983.\nAccordingly, the City’s motion is denied insofar as it seeks dismissal of the\nPlaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims premised on rights identified in paragraphs 348(g) through (i) of\nthe Amended Complaint.\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22) - Right to Receive Quality Services to Protect Each Child’s\nSafety and Health                                                                                                        \nParagraph 348(j) of the Amended Complaint asserts that Defendants have\nviolated a right guaranteed by Section 671(a)(22), which provides that “the State shall develop\nand implement standards to ensure that children in foster care placements in public or private\nagencies are provided quality services that protect the safety and health of the children.”  42\nU.S.C.S. § 671(a)(22) (LexisNexis 2008).  This section is clearly intended to benefit individual\nchildren who are in placements with agencies, and it is phrased in mandatory terms insofar as it\nrequires the development and implementation of standards, thus meeting the first and third\nelements of the Blessing test.  See 520 U.S. at 340-41.  Its language is, however, too vague and\namorphous to support the finding of an individually enforceable right.  Nothing in the statute\nprovides a benchmark or other means for determining how the mandate for provision of “quality\nservices that protect the safety and health of the children” is to be met.  Congress has delegated\nto the states the responsibility of determining the requisite levels of “quality” of services and the\nextent and by what means the “safety and health of the children” are to be protected through\nservices.  The Court finds that, like the “reasonable efforts” provision at issue in Suter, it is “a\ndirective whose meaning will obviously vary with the circumstances of each individual case,”\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 17\n\n503 U.S. at 360, that is not enforceable in an individual action pursuant to Section 1983.\nAccordingly, the City’s motion is granted with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims\npremised on the claim of right asserted in paragraph 348(j) of the Amended Complaint. \nClaims of Plaintiff James\nThe City Defendants also move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6), to dismiss the claims asserted by Plaintiff James, arguing that she has failed to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted.  (See City Def. Memo, at pp. 16-19.)  As noted at the\noutset of this Memorandum Opinion and Order, Plaintiff James has withdrawn her claims\nagainst the City and, in the Amended Complaint, only asserts claims against the State\nDefendants.  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion is a defensive motion, see, e.g., Del Medical Imaging Corp.\nv. CR Tech USA, Inc., No. 08 CV 8556-LAP, 2010 WL 1487994, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13,\n2010), and thus cannot be asserted by City Defendants as against a plaintiff who has asserted no\nclaim against them, see, e.g., Dover Ltd. v. A.B. Watley, Inc., No. 04 CV 7366-FM, 2006 WL\n2987054, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2006) (“[Defendant] also contends that the six additional\ncounts of the [complaint] fail to state a claim for relief . . . What he fails to note is that he has not\nbeen named as a defendant in any claim for relief other than Count I. Accordingly, he lacks\nstanding to attack the legal sufficiency of those other counts”); Chabad Lubavitch of Litchfield\nCounty, Inc. v. Borough of Litchfield, Conn., No. 09 CV 1419-JCH, 2010 WL 1882308, at *3\n(D. Conn. May 10, 2010) (“[A] party may only file a Rule 12(b) motion presenting a defense to\nclaims asserted against it.”).  Furthermore, because James has asserted no claims as against the\nCity Defendants, there is no case or controversy between these parties, and City Defendants thus\nlack standing to challenge James’ capacity to sue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17. \nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 18\n\nFurthermore, the City Defendants’ capacity arguments concern state and local law matters\n(including the Public Advocate’s ability to exercise control over ACS and her rights to litigate in\nher official capacity) that do not arise from the same transactions or occurrence as Plaintiffs’\nclaims concerning foster care.  The City Defendants’ motion is therefore denied to the extent that\nit seeks the dismissal of Plaintiff James’ claims.\nDefendants ACS and Commissioner Carrion\nCity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims to the extent that they are\nasserted against Defendants ACS and Commissioner Carrion (sued in her official capacity only),\narguing that those Defendants are non-suable entities.  The Second Circuit has recognized that\n“as a general matter, agencies of New York City are not suable entities in § 1983 actions.” \nNnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d 147, 163 n.6 (2d Cir. 2011); see also Allen v. Mattingly, No. 10 CV\n667-SJF, 2011 WL 1261103, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2011) (where plaintiff sued the\nCommissioner of ACS, the attorney for ACS and an ACS caseworker in their official capacities,\n“such claims [were] deemed to be claims against the ACS, which lack[ed] the capacity to sue or\nbe sued”), aff’d, 478 F. App’x 712 (2d Cir. 2012); Friedman v. New York City Admin. For\nChildren’s Services, 502 F. App’x 23, 28 n.3 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Even though Mr. Friedman\nbrought claims against ACS, City agencies are not suable entities, and thus, the proper defendant\nis the City of New York.”).  Moreover, courts within this Circuit have consistently held that New\nYork City agencies are not considered “persons” for the purposes of Section 1983 liability.  See,\ne.g., Milhouse v. Renaissance Men’s Residence, No. 12 CV 6437-DLI, 2013 WL 1811332, at *3\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2013) (“Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff’s claim can be construed as arising\nunder the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 . . . DHS is a New York City agency, and,\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 19\n\ntherefore, is not a ‘person’ for purposes of § 1983 liability.”); Reaves v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, No. 08 CV 1624-RJD, 2008 WL 2853255, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 22, 2008) (“Section\n1983 claims against the City and federal agencies would also be dismissed, because only\nindividuals, and not entities such as agencies or facilities, may be considered ‘persons’ for\npurposes of liability under § 1983.”); Vasquez v. City of New York, No. 99 CV 4606-DC, 2000\nWL 869492, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2000) (“New York City agencies . . . are organizational\nsubdivisions of the City of New York lacking independent legal existence and, therefore, cannot\nbe sued under § 1983.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nSection 396 of the New York City Charter provides that “[a]ll actions and\nproceedings for the recovery of penalties for the violation of any law shall be brought in the\nname of the City of New York and not in that of any agency, except where otherwise provided\nby law.”  See N.Y. City Charter Ch. 17, § 396 (“Section 396\").  Courts have consistently found\nthis language to mean that “[i]ndividual City agencies are not suable entities unless specified by\nlaw.”  Pimentel v. City of New York, No. 00 CV 326-SAS, 2000 WL 1576871, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. 23, 2000).  The Second Circuit has noted that Section 396 “has been construed to mean that\nNew York City departments, as distinct from the City itself, lack the capacity to be sued.” \nXimines v. George Wingate High Sch., 516 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir. 2008).  This reasoning\nextends to ACS and, in turn, Commissioner Carrion.  See, e.g., Ampratwum v. City of New\nYork, No. 11 CV 6111-DLC, 2013 WL 1935321, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2013); Worrell v. City\nof New York, No. 12 CV 6151-MKB, 2014 WL 1224257, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2014).        \nPlaintiffs argue, however, that Section 396 only forecloses suits brought against\ncity agencies for monetary damages, focusing on the provision’s use of the term “recovery of\npenalties.”  (See Pl. Children Opp., at pp. 21-23.)  In the instant case, Plaintiffs argue, the only\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 20\n\nrelief sought is injunctive, and thus the suit is not barred by the City Charter.  (See id.)  This\nargument is unavailing.  As an initial matter, Section 396 contains no modifier that can be\nconstrued to limit the word “penalties” in that provision solely to monetary repercussions. \nAlthough Plaintiffs urge that a plain language reading of that provision limits its application to\nsuits seeking monetary recovery, the dictionary definition cited by City Defendants makes clear\nthat “penalties” are not a strictly financial concept.  (See Docket Entry No. 135, Reply City\nDefendants’ Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss, at pp. 14-15.)  The\ncases cited by Plaintiffs in support of their argument are unpersuasive, as none of them engages\nin legal analysis of the issue of whether Section 396 permits suits seeking injunctive relief\nagainst city agencies.  See generally Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662 (S.D.N.Y. 1996);\nM.K.B. v. Eggleston, 445 F. Supp. 2d 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); Nicholson v. Scoppetta, 344 F.3d\n154 (2d Cir. 2003); People United For Children, Inc. v. City of New York, 108 F. Supp. 2d 275,\n302 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).  Moreover, the City Defendants have pointed to several cases in which\ncourts have dismissed arguments by plaintiffs claiming that they may sue city agencies because\nthey seek declaratory or injunctive relief in addition to monetary penalties.  See, e.g., Corley v.\nCity of New York, No. 14 CV 3202-GHW, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121330, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y.\nAug. 29, 2014) (the fact that an individual seeks declaratory and injunctive relief “does not\nchange the fact that the [relevant city agencies] are not suable entities”); Rentas v. Johnson, No.\n10CV4244-DAB-FM, 2011 WL 2652473, at *5 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2011) (Report &\nRecommendation) (dismissing claims seeking both injunctive and monetary relief as against\nnon-suable city agency); Allen, 2011 WL 1261103 (same).  \nThe City Defendants’ motion is, accordingly, granted to the extent that it seeks to\ndismiss Plaintiffs’ claims against ACS and Commissioner Carrion, without prejudice to litigation\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 21\n\nof those claims as against the Defendant City.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, City Defendants’ motion is granted in part.  City\nDefendants’ motion is granted to the extent that it seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs’ AACWA claims\npremised on 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(10) and 671(a)(22) described in paragraphs 348(a) and (j) of\nthe Amended Complaint, and on the purported rights described in paragraphs 348(c)-(f) of the\nAmended Complaint.  City Defendants’ motion is also granted to the extent that it seeks the\ndismissal of the claims asserted against ACS and Commissioner Carrion, without prejudice to\nthe litigation of those claims as against the Defendant City.  The motion is denied in all other\nrespects.\nThis Opinion and Order resolves Docket Entry Number 114.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: New York, New York\nSeptember 12, 2016\n   /s/ Laura Taylor Swain    \nLAURA TAYLOR SWAIN\nUnited States District Judge\nELISA W - MTD.WPD VERSION SEPTEMBER 12, 2016 22",

      "title": "Fact Sheet: Elisa W. v. City of New York",
      "text": " \n \n \n \n \n \nContact: Javier Lacayo, jlacayo@pubadvocate.nyc.gov, 646-942-1703 \nMarcia Robinson Lowry, mlowry@abetterchildhood.org, 844-422-2425   \nFACT SHEET: Elisa W. v. City of New York \n \nPlaintiffs: Ten foster children representing the class of over 11,000 New York City foster children; and Public \nAdvocate Letitia James. The foster children are being represented by Marcia Robinson Lowry, Executive Director, A \nBetter Childhood, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP.  \n \nDefendants: The City of New York, New York City Administration of Children’s Services (ACS), ACS Commissioner \nGladys Carrion, the State of New York, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS), and \nOCFS Commissioner Sheila Poole. \n \nThe lawsuit alleges that: \n●  ACS and OCFS are causing irreparable harm to children in custody by failing to protect children from \nmaltreatment, failing to ensure services provided are effective and of acceptable quality, and failing to ensure \nappropriate placements. ACS and OCFS fail to provide children in ACS custody with permanent homes and \nfamilies and reunification within a reasonable time. \n●  The harms and risks that children in ACS custody suffer result from ACS and OCFS are failing to properly \naddress structural deficiencies in the New York City child welfare system. \n \nAbout the NYC foster care system: \n●  There are currently 11,137 children in the NYC foster care system, accounting for almost 60% of children in \nfoster care in NYS. \n●  ACS is legally responsible for all children in foster care, but has delegated responsibility for the day-to-day \ncare of these children to 29 private agencies, with which it contracts for the children’s care. \n●  NYS ranks 46th out of 48 states and territories for instances of substantiated or indicated maltreatment of \nchildren while in foster care.  \n●  Children in NYC spend over twice as long in foster care as children in the rest of NYS and the country. They \nspend a median of 27.2 months in foster care while children in the rest of NYS spend a median of 15.1 \nmonths in foster care and children in the nation spend a median of 12.4 months in foster care. \n●  Children in NYC spend a median of 12.6 months in foster care before being reunified with their families while \nchildren in the rest of NYS spend a median of 10.8 months, and children in the rest of the nation spend a \nmedian of 8.6 months, in foster care prior to being returned home. \n●  It takes longer to be adopted in NYC than in the rest of NYS and every other state in the nation. Children \nwho were adopted in NYC in 2013 spent a median of 55.8 months—over 4.5 years—in foster care prior to \nadoption. \n●  In number of days until a child is freed for adoption, NYC ranks last. It takes twice as long to be freed for \nadoption in NYC as in the rest of NYS (42.2 months v. 22.1 months). It takes 2.5 times as long to be freed \nfor adoption in NYC as in the rest of the nation (42.2 months v. 16.8 months). \n●  Each year, approximately 1,000 young people “age out” of the NYC foster care system, 80% of whom are on \ntheir own with virtually no safety net. Research has shown that children who age out are more likely than \ntheir peers to be unemployed, homeless, and incarcerated as adults. Twenty percent of children who aged \nout of the foster care system in NYC entered a homeless shelter within three years of leaving the foster care \nsystem.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \nTHE PLAINTIFFS \nThe children’s identities legally cannot be revealed. Using pseudonyms, these are the plaintiffs representing the \nclass: \n \nElisa W. ACS removed Elisa W. from her biological mother when she was four years old and her mother’s parental \nrights have been terminated. She is now 16 years old, and has been in foster care for 12 years. Elisa W. has been \nshuffled through so many foster placements she is unable to account for all of them. While in foster care, she has \nbeen sexually abused, beaten, denied food, and neglected. Elisa W. has been diagnosed with depression, bipolar \ndisorder, and PTSD. She has been hospitalized for mental health reasons and has been on antidepressants and \nmood stabilizers since she was 11. She would like to go to college and remembers that when she was younger she \ndid well in school, but now has difficulty concentrating. At 16, Elisa W. is old enough to articulate her hopes and \nfeelings but, in her own words, “no one ever asks me what I want.” She fears that she will age out of foster care and \nreturn to living with her biological mother. Elisa W. remains without a permanent home and family to call her own.  \n \nAlexandria R. ACS removed Alexandria R. from her biological mother when she was four years old; reportedly, this \nis her second time in foster care. She is now 12 years old and has been in foster care for the past eight years. \nDuring this time, she has been in approximately nine foster care placements and suffered physical and suspected \nsexual abuse. Alexandria R. now suffers from PTSD and behavioral problems, including physical aggression toward \nherself and others. She deeply distrusts anyone she views as “in the system” and does not understand why her \ncurrent foster parents, who are interested in adopting her, have been unable to do so. Alexandria R. remains without \na permanent home and family to call her own.  \n \nThierry E. ACS removed Thierry E. from his biological mother when he was two years old after his mother reported \nthat she was being abused by Thierry E.’s biological father. Thierry E. is now almost four years old and has spent \nalmost half of his young life in foster care. During the past 21 months he has spent in ACS custody, he has been \nshuffled between two contract agencies and two foster placements. As a result, he suffers from developmental \ndelays and emotional trauma. All indications are that he misses his mother very much; at the end of their twice \nweekly visits, he cries uncontrollably. Although his mother has completed parenting classes, mental health \nevaluations and counseling, ACS has made no effort to ensure that this little boy is returned to her. In fact, when \nThierry E.’s mother expressed concern about how upset he is when their visits end, she was told to “get used to it” \nbecause this was “his life now”. Thierry E. remains without a permanent home and family to call his own.  \n \nAyanna J. ACS removed Ayanna J. from her biological mother three days after she was born due to a prior finding \nof abuse against her mother. Before Ayanna J. was born, her nineteen month old sister was beaten to death by her \nmother’s then-boyfriend. Ayanna J. is now almost three years old and still in ACS custody. Ayanna J. used to cry \nhysterically during visits with her mother and now says she does not want to visit her mother, often refusing during \nthose visits to leave her babysitter’s side. A petition to terminate Ayanna J.’s biological parents’ parental rights was \nfiled in April 2014, but Ayanna J.’s court hearing has been repeatedly postponed. Her foster parent is willing to adopt \nher. Ayanna J. remains without a permanent home and family to call her own.  \n \nOlivia R. and Ana-Maria R. ACS removed Olivia and Ana-Maria R. from their biological parents in 2011. They are \nnow five and four years old, respectively, and have spent the past four years in foster care. During their time in \nfoster care, ACS has shuffled them between three homes. In 2013, Olivia R. was sexually abused while Ana-Maria  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nR. was present. When Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s foster care agency was made aware of the abuse, neither the \nagency nor ACS took any action. As a result of the severe emotional damage they have both suffered while in \ncustody, both girls have been diagnosed with a variety of mental health problems—Olivia R. has serious trust issues \nand Ana-Maria R. must be medicated for severe hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. Ana-Maria R. spent all of \nspring 2015 unable to attend her pre-kindergarten program because her caseworker did not obtain the necessary \nmedication for her to attend. Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s foster mother is willing to adopt them. Olivia and Ana-Maria \nR. remain without a permanent home and family to call their own. \n \nXavion M. ACS removed Xavion M. from his biological mother when he was just 15 days old. He is now five years \nold and has spent his entire young life in foster care. During his time in custody, he has been in two foster homes, \nincluding one in which he was severely neglected. Xavion M. has been physically assaulted by his sibling during an \nunsupervised visit with his mother. As a result of the severe emotional damage he has suffered while in ACS \ncustody, he exhibits behavioral problems and attachment issues, such as refusing to sleep anywhere but in his \nfoster mother’s bed. Although Xavion M.’s official permanency goal is “adoption” and his foster mother is willing to \nadopt him, his caseworker intends to return him to live with his biological mother. Xavion M. is very confused about \nwhether or when he will be moving again to live with his biological mother. Xavion M. remains without a permanent \nhome and family to call his own.  \n \nDameon C. ACS removed Dameon C. from his biological mother when he was just nine days old. He is now four \nyears old and has special needs. During the past four years, Dameon C. has been shuffled among placements and \nwas physically abused by his mother during their first unsupervised overnight visit. As a result of the severe \nemotional damage he has suffered while in state custody, he has been diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional \nDefiant Disorder; he also exhibits persistent head banging behavior. Dameon C.’s foster mother is willing to adopt \nhim, but his Family Court hearings have been repeatedly postponed. Dameon C. remains without a permanent \nhome and family to call his own.  \n \nTyrone M. ACS removed Tyrone M. from his biological mother when he was just 12 days old. He is now seven \nyears old and is still in foster care. Tyrone has been shuffled through three foster care placements. In the foster care \nplacement immediately previous to his current placement, he suffered severe neglect. Tyrone M. arrived at his \ncurrent foster care placement exhibiting severe dental problems and went to sleep in his clothing every night \nbecause he was never taught to undress or change into pajamas. As a result of the severe emotional damage he \nhas suffered while in ACS custody, he suffers from a variety of mental health problems and exhibits behavioral \nproblems so severe that his school has barred him from eating in the lunchroom. Tyrone M. is legally free to be \nadopted but he remains without a permanent home and family to call his own. \n \nBrittney W. ACS removed Brittney W. from her biological mother when she was two years old. Brittany W. has \nspecial needs. She is now seven years old and has been in foster care for over four years. Even though Brittney \nW.’s lawyer does not think that her biological mother is able to provide appropriate care for her daughter, the foster \ncare agency to which Brittney W. is assigned has taken the position that her biological mother can provide care if \nshe has 24-hour medical support. Meanwhile, her biological mother’s doctor does not believe this is necessary. It is \nunclear what will happen to Brittney or when a decision about her future will be made. Her foster mother is willing to \nadopt her, but she remains without a permanent home and family to call her own.  ",

Foster care is supposed to be safe and temporary.  For children in New York \nCity’s foster care system, it is neither.  Children in New York City’s foster care system are in one \nof the most dangerous foster care systems in the country, and they spend longer in foster care \nthan do foster children almost anywhere else in the country.  The emotional damage—and, far \ntoo often, abuse—suffered by these children at the hands of a system designed to keep them safe \nis unacceptable.  That the responsible state and city officials have known about these problems \nand done nothing to fix them is inexcusable. \n2.  Nineteen named plaintiffs, all children in foster care in New York City, bring this \nlawsuit as a civil rights action on behalf of all children who are now or will be in the foster care \ncustody of the Commissioner of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services \n(“ACS”) (“Plaintiff Children”).  They seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against the city \nand state agencies and officials responsible for violating their rights under the United States \nConstitution, federal law, and New York state law and regulations.  Plaintiff Letitia James, as \nPublic Advocate for the City of New York, who has received myriad constituent complaints \nconcerning foster care, brings this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the \nState Defendants to ensure that ACS promptly remedies the systemic failures that have been \nplaguing New York City’s foster care system for too long.   \n3.  Defendants are the City of New York (“City”), ACS, Gladys Carrión, \nCommissioner of ACS, in her official capacity (collectively, “City Defendants”); the State of \nNew York, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”), and Sheila J. \nPoole, Acting Commissioner of OCFS, in her official capacity (collectively, “State Defendants”). \n4.  Through a pattern and practice of long-standing and well-documented action and \ninaction, Defendants—who are responsible for protecting New York City’s foster children—fail \n \n \n \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  55  ooff  112299\nto keep these children safe.  And, instead of ensuring that New York City’s foster children grow \nup in safe, permanent families, Defendants’ policies and customs cause far too many children to \ngrow up in the custody of the state, without a home or family to call their own: \na.  New York City children make up the majority of children in foster care in \nNew York State, which has one of the worst rates of maltreatment in foster \ncare of any jurisdiction in this country. \nb.  Children in foster care in New York City spend two times as much time in \nstate custody as children in the rest of New York State, and over double \nthe amount of time in state custody as children in the rest of the nation. \nc.  It takes longer to return New York City children in foster care to their \nparents than in the rest of New York State and the rest of the nation.  The \nmost recent federal data available shows that New York City performs \nworse on this measure than all but five other states and territories. \nd.  It takes longer for a foster child to be adopted in New York City than \nanywhere else in the country.  New York City has performed worse on this \nmeasure than every state since at least 2007.   \ne.  Many children who are without a permanent home never get adopted at all \nand leave the foster care system only when they get too old to stay in it \nany longer.  Approximately 1,000 children “age out” of the foster care \nsystem each year, often winding up homeless and without any adult with \nwhom they have a permanent connection.   \n2 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  66  ooff  112299\n5.  New York City’s child welfare system is causing devastating, ongoing and long-\nlasting harm to New York City children in its care:  \na.  Children who are separated from their parents to whom they could be \nreturned weep at the end of visits with their parents but continue to live in \nfoster care well beyond the time they could be returned home.   \nb.  Parents whose children are removed because they need services are unable \nto gain access to the right services and thus are unable to regain custody of \ntheir children. \nc.  Children who cannot be safely returned to their parents languish in foster \ncare, many moving from place to place, growing older and more damaged \nby their experiences, not knowing to which adults to form attachments, or \ntrusting no adults at all. \nd.  Children traumatized by the disruptions in their young lives do not know \nwhere they will be living from one month to the next, or whether there are \nany adults on whom they can rely.  Often by the time a decision is made \nabout what the plan should be for their future, they are irreparably \ndamaged by their experiences in foster care. \n6.  These consequences are the result of systemic deficiencies in which: \na.  The state agency, OCFS, is responsible for foster care across New York \nState and for ensuring that federal foster care funds are spent as required \nby the governing federal statutes and state statutes and regulations \n3 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  77  ooff  112299\nconsistent with federal law, but neither monitors nor enforces those laws \nand regulations. \nb.  The city agency, ACS, in whose legal custody all foster children are \nplaced, delegates its responsibility for the day-to-day care of these \nchildren by contract to 29 agencies (the “Contract Agencies”), paying \nhundreds of millions of dollars to the Contract Agencies for foster care \nservices but failing to ensure they meet minimum professional standards \nor provide adequate and meaningful oversight to ensure compliance with \nfederal and state law and the applicable contracts. \nc.  The damage that is being done to children in foster care in New York City \nas a direct result of these structural failures in the New York City child \nwelfare system is both avoidable and a violation of these children’s \nstatutory and constitutional rights.   \n7.  The illegal conduct of which Plaintiffs complain has plagued New York City’s \nfoster care system for far too long—a fact well known to Defendants, all of whom have been in a \nposition to change it.  \n8.  Plaintiffs seek a ruling from this Court that the structural deficiencies and long-\nstanding actions and inactions described in this complaint violate the statutory and constitutional \nrights of all children dependent on the New York City foster care system for their safety, their \nwell-being and their futures.  They seek an equitable injunction against the responsible city and \nstate officials and agencies named as Defendants in this lawsuit, directing that appropriate relief \nbe granted so that New York City’s foster children are no longer irreparably harmed by the \n4 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  88  ooff  112299\nsystem that is supposed to protect them.  These children have a right to a safe and nurturing \nchildhood.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to protect that right. \nPARTIES \nI.  The Named Plaintiff Children  \nElisa W. \n9.  Plaintiff Elisa W. is a 17 year old girl in the twelfth grade.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother when she was approximately four years old.  She has been in ACS \ncustody for the past 13 years—over three quarters of her life.  \n10.  Plaintiff Elisa W. appears through her next friend, Elizabeth Barricelli.  Ms. \nBarricelli has been an elementary school teacher for over 30 years and currently teaches \nelementary school science at a public school in Brooklyn.  Ms. Barricelli taught Elisa W. from \n2006 to 2010 when Elisa W. was in elementary school and they recently reconnected.  Ms. \nBarricelli is familiar with Elisa W.’s background and education.  Ms. Barricelli is truly dedicated \nto Elisa W.’s best interests. \n11.  ACS removed Plaintiff Elisa W. from her biological mother when she was four \nyears old because of allegations of physical abuse.  At the time, Elisa W.’s biological mother was \napproximately 19 years old and living in a mother-child foster placement in New York City.   \n12.  Over the past 13 years, ACS has shuffled Plaintiff Elisa W. through so many \nfoster placements that she is unable to account for all of them—a direct result of ACS’s failure to \nensure an appropriate foster placement that could meet her needs.  In the last two years alone, \nElisa W. has been in four foster placements.  Elisa W. has attended at least seven schools over \nthe course of her young life.   \n5 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  99  ooff  112299\n13.  Plaintiff Elisa W. has a reported history of physical and suspected sexual abuse \nwhile in ACS custody. \n14.  In the first foster placement Plaintiff Elisa W. can remember, she was sexually \nabused by the nephew of her then-foster mother.  She was just six years old at the time.  She did \nnot report the incident to anyone because she did not want to get in trouble.  At this same \nplacement, Elisa W. was subjected to other physical, psychological and emotional abuse, \nincluding being forced by her then-foster mother to sleep in a bug-infested bedroom and being \nforced to walk around the foster home naked after bathing.  Once, Plaintiff Elisa W.’s then-foster \nmother beat her and denied her food as punishment for purportedly telling her biological mother \nthat she was being beaten by her foster mother; however, the allegation had been made by the \nfoster mother’s own daughter pretending to be Elisa W.  Upon information and belief, Elisa W.’s \nthen-foster mother would allow family members with violent criminal records in the home.  Elisa \nW. reports feeling like “just a total stranger” in this foster placement.   \n15.  In approximately 2006, Plaintiff Elisa W. was placed in another foster placement, \nand again suffered severe physical, psychological and emotional abuse, including sexual abuse \nby multiple relatives of her then-foster mother.  Elisa W.’s teachers made multiple reports of \nphysical abuse to her caseworker, including when Elisa W.’s then-foster mother punched her in \nthe face.  Upon information and belief, neither the Contract Agency nor ACS took any action in \nresponse to these reports.  Her then-foster mother neglected Elisa W., who often went to school \nunkempt and underfed; her teacher at the time, her next friend Ms. Barricelli, often had to buy \nElisa W. snacks during the school day and maintained a clean uniform at school for her.  Elisa \nW. remained in this abusive foster placement for five years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to \nensure that the Contract Agency to which ACS had delegated day-to-day care of this young girl \n6 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1100  ooff  112299\nwas keeping her safe.  On April 28, 2014, Elisa W. was assigned to a different Contract Agency \nwhen it was determined she needed “therapeutic foster placements”.  Although Elisa W. is from \nNew York City, the Contract Agency first placed her in a home in Suffolk County and then in a \nhome in Nassau County.  However, at the time—and to this day—the only person Elisa W. \nconsiders a friend lives in New York City.        \n16.  As a result of the great emotional damage Plaintiff Elisa W. has suffered while in \nACS custody for the past 13 years, this young girl has suffered and continues to suffer from a \nvariety of mental health problems.  Her diagnoses include depression, bipolar disorder and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.  She has been on anti-depressants and mood stabilizers since she was \n11 years old.  In July 2014, Elisa W. requested she be placed in a mental health facility because \nof her mental health concerns.  Elisa W. remained there for two months.  Since her \nhospitalization, she has been placed on heavy doses of psychotropic medication; she reports that, \nas a result, she can barely string a sentence together and no longer looks people in the eye \nbecause she gets nervous.  On or about December 16, 2015, Elisa W. was voluntarily \nhospitalized for one day because of her mental health concerns. \n17.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Elisa W. free from physical, psychological \nand emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate \nsteps consistent with professional standards to place Elisa W. in a permanent home.  Twice, Elisa \nW.’s biological mother conditionally surrendered her parental rights so Elisa W. could be \nadopted.  Neither adoption was ever finalized.  In approximately 2010, Elisa W.’s aunt expressed \ninterest in adopting Elisa W.  This adoption was not finalized.  In 2012, after Elisa W. already \nhad been in foster care for approximately eight years, her biological mother’s parental rights \nwere terminated.  Although Elisa W. has requested that her aunt be considered as an adoptive \n7 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1111  ooff  112299\nresource, upon information and belief, the Contract Agency, ACS and Elisa W.’s law guardian \nhave not taken steps to pursue this possibility or sought out other non-relative adoption \npossibilities for Elisa W. to finally have a permanent home and family to call her own.  Indeed, \nElisa W. fears that she will “age out” of foster care—where she has spent the last 13 years being \nabused, neglected and shuffled from place to place—and return to living with her biological \nmother.  Elisa W. fears that if this happens she will be unable to attend college. \n18.  Plaintiff Elisa W. describes her stay in foster care by noting that when she was \nyounger she did well in school and had an extensive vocabulary, but now, as a result of her \nexperiences in foster care and medication regimen, she has difficulty concentrating.  Elisa W. is \nat risk of having to repeat the twelfth grade because of class days she misses for appointments \nmade with doctors by the Contract Agency and Family Court appearances.  She expresses great \nfrustration that the Contract Agency and ACS are unresponsive to her requests for driving \nlessons and a state identification card—normal requests for a 17 year old girl.  Although Elisa W. \nhas told the supervisor at the Contract Agency that she wants to be like “normal kids” and go on \nschool trips, the Contract Agency has denied her requests to go on such trips.  For the 13 years \nElisa W. has been in foster care, the Contract Agency, ACS and Plaintiff Elisa W.’s law guardian \nhave been making decisions about her life but, as she puts it—“no one ever asks me what I \nwant”.  \n19.  During the 13 years that Plaintiff Elisa W. has been in the custody of ACS, \nDefendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by failing \nto protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \n8 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1122  ooff  112299\ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has \ndelegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  As a direct \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Elisa W. has suffered and continues to suffer \nirreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Elisa W. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment. \nAlexandria R.   \n20.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. is a 12 year old girl in the sixth grade.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother’s home on August 9, 2007.  She has been in the custody of ACS for \nthe past eight years—over two thirds of her life.   \n21.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. appears through her next friend, Alison Max Rothschild.  \nMs. Rothschild is the director of a private school in New York City.  Ms. Rothschild knows \nAlexandria R. and her current foster parents, and is familiar with her background including her \neducation.  Ms. Rothschild is truly dedicated to Alexandria R.’s best interests.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, this is Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s second time in foster \ncare.  Upon information and belief, ACS removed her from her biological mother a few months \nafter she was born, placed her in a kinship foster placement with her maternal great-grandmother \n9 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1133  ooff  112299\nfor three and a half years and returned her to her biological mother for a few months—only to \nremove her and again place her in foster care in 2007.   \n23.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. is not the only child that ACS has removed from her \nbiological mother and placed into foster care.  Alexandria R. has six siblings:  (1) a 15 year old \nsister, Andrea R.; (2) a 13 year old brother, Kavon L.; (3) an 11 year old brother, Russell W.; \n(4) a nine year old brother, Anton W.; (5) a seven year old sister, Naomi M.W.; and (6) a two \nyear old sister, Raquel W.  All of her siblings are currently in foster care; five live in foster \nplacements and Naomi M.W. has been returned to her biological father on a trial basis. \n24.  In 2006, ACS opened a preventive services case involving Plaintiff Alexandria \nR.’s biological mother because then six year old Andrea R. had jumped out of a second floor \nwindow after being locked in her bedroom.  In August 2007, ACS removed Alexandria R. and \nher then-living siblings from their home and placed them in ACS custody because their \nbiological mother’s boyfriend was physically abusing Alexandria R.’s brother, Kavon L.  Now \nseven year old Naomi M.W. was born five months later and ACS took custody of her at birth.  \nOn or about May 13, 2015, ACS removed Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s youngest sister, Raquel W., \nfrom their biological mother due to allegations of neglect. \n25.  From 2007 to 2011, between the time she was four and eight years old, ACS \nbounced Plaintiff Alexandria R. from placement to placement due to its failure to ensure an \nappropriate foster placement that could meet her needs.  During her first four years in ACS \ncustody, ACS placed Alexandria R. in approximately eight different foster homes and with two \ndifferent Contract Agencies.  When she was approximately eight years old, Alexandria R. spent \napproximately six months in the mental health unit of a residential treatment facility.  Her then-\nfoster parents dropped her off, telling her they would return the next morning to pick her up, and \n10 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1144  ooff  112299\nnever returned.  As a result, Alexandria R. suffered severe emotional trauma, compounding the \nemotional harm she was already experiencing from being moved from place to place. \n26.  ACS moved Plaintiff Alexandria R. to her current foster placement on November \n11, 2011, when she was eight years old.  She has now lived there for over four years.  At 12 \nyears old, this is the longest she has ever lived in one place—a direct result of ACS’s failure to \ndevelop and implement an appropriate case plan and provide appropriate services consistent with \nprofessional standards to enable this young girl to be safely returned to her biological mother or, \nif that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to ensure that she can grow up in a \npermanent family. \n27.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. has a reported history of physical and suspected sexual \nabuse.  Upon information and belief, the physical and suspected sexual abuse has taken place \nwhile Alexandria R. has been in ACS custody, and includes physical abuse by her biological \nmother during an unsupervised visit at her then-foster home. \n28.  As a result of the great emotional damage Plaintiff Alexandria R. has suffered \nwhile in ACS custody for the past eight years, this young girl has suffered and continues to suffer \nfrom a variety of mental health problems.  Her diagnoses over the past eight years have only \ngrown more serious during her time in foster care and have included adjustment disorder (2007), \nadjustment disorder with mixed disturbance emotions and conduct (i.e., mood and behavioral \nproblems) (2009), disorder of childhood (2009) and post-traumatic stress disorder (2014 to \npresent).  She also suffers from learning disabilities and is behind her peers in school. \n29.  Since being placed in ACS custody, Plaintiff Alexandria R. has suffered severe \nemotional and behavioral problems, including physical aggression toward herself and others.  \nShe has an extreme distrust of people she views as “in the system”, including her doctors and \n11 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1155  ooff  112299\ntherapists.  She also has difficulty controlling her emotions.  As recently as late 2014, Alexandria \nR. became highly emotional and distraught, including hysterically crying and becoming \nphysically aggressive, when her biological mother missed a family therapy appointment. \n30.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Alexandria R. free from physical, \npsychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable \nand appropriate steps consistent with professional standards to place Alexandria R. in a \npermanent home.  In approximately 2012, after she already had been in foster care for over four \nyears, Alexandria R.’s permanency goal was changed to adoption and the Contract Agency to \nwhich ACS has delegated day-to-day responsibility for this child told this nine year old girl that \nshe would be adopted by her foster parents.  However, the adoption did not take place at that \ntime, even though her foster parents were interested in adopting her.  This created serious \nadditional damage to Alexandria R.’s emotional state, causing her anger and confusion as to why \nher foster parents have not been able to adopt her.  Alexandria R. reportedly has lived in fear that \nshe will be moved yet again by ACS and has been deeply harmed by the continuing uncertainty \nabout where and how she will grow up.   \n31.  In July 2013, Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s permanency goal was changed from \nadoption to return to parent.  Upon information and belief, this is because ACS attorneys failed \nto take necessary steps to obtain the termination of her biological mother’s parental rights. \n32.  On or about October 28, 2015, Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s biological mother \nvoluntarily surrendered her parental rights on the condition that Alexandria R.’s current foster \nparents adopt her.  Upon information and belief, the possibility of voluntarily surrendering her \nparental rights or pursuing an open adoption was not discussed with Alexandria R.’s biological \nmother until 2015—after Alexandria R. had already been in foster care for between seven and \n12 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1166  ooff  112299\neight years.  Although Alexandria R.’s foster parents are pursuing adopting her, they have been \nunable to timely obtain the documents necessary to proceed with the adoption. \n33.  During the eight years that Plaintiff Alexandria R. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Alexandria \nR. has suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the \nlasting emotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of \nnot knowing where she will grow up and of believing that there is no family she can call her \nown.  Because of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Alexandria R. is being deprived of \nthe opportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the \nopportunity for stability and healthy development. \nThierry E. \n34.  Plaintiff Thierry E. is a four year old boy in pre-kindergarten.  ACS removed him \nfrom his biological mother on September 27, 2013.  His permanency goal currently is to be \nreturned to his parent.  He has been in ACS custody for more than two years—over half his life.  \n13 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1177  ooff  112299\n35.  Plaintiff Thierry E. appears through his next friend, Amy Mulzer.  Ms. Mulzer is \nan Acting Assistant Professor of Lawyering at New York University School of Law.  The \nprimary focus of her research includes:  Adoption, Child Welfare, Family Law, Parental Rights \nand Poverty Law.  Prior to joining the lawyering faculty at NYU, Ms. Mulzer spent five years \nrepresenting low-income parents whose children were in foster care or at risk of being placed in \nfoster care, first as a staff attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services and then as an appellate \nattorney on the assigned counsel panel for the Appellate Division, Second Department.  Ms. \nMulzer is truly dedicated to Thierry E.’s best interests.  \n36.  On or about August 15, 2013, Plaintiff Thierry E.’s biological mother, who has \nbeen a public school teacher for over a decade, called Safe Horizon, a domestic violence hotline, \nto request information about how she could remove Thierry E.’s biological father from her home.  \nSafe Horizon reported the call to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and \nMaltreatment and ACS opened an investigation.  There was not and never has been any \nallegation that anyone abused Thierry E. or that his biological mother failed to provide him with \nappropriate, loving care.  On September 23, 2013, Thierry E.’s biological mother obtained an \norder of protection from the Family Court against Thierry E.’s biological father.  In her petition, \nshe alleged that Thierry E.’s biological father had held a knife to her throat threatening to kill \nher, strangled her at least three times, punched her in the face and threw household furniture at \nher.  Thierry E.’s biological mother has not been in a relationship with Thierry E.’s biological \nfather since September 2013 and does not intend to re-enter a relationship with him.  Thierry E.’s \nbiological father has since been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder.  \n37.  ACS removed Plaintiff Thierry E. from his home on September 27, 2013, while \nhis biological mother was at work, without taking necessary steps or making reasonable efforts \n14 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1188  ooff  112299\nto determine whether Thierry E. could remain safely at home with her.  His biological father was \nno longer living in the house. \n38.  The Contract Agency to which ACS had delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Thierry E. first moved him to a foster placement far \naway from his biological mother’s home and required visits to take place at the Contract \nAgency’s office in the Bronx, even though he and his biological mother had lived in Manhattan.  \nMoreover, the foster mother spoke only Spanish and Thierry E., then two years old, did not \nspeak any Spanish.  As a result, Thierry E.’s language and speech development was severely \nstunted.  Thierry E.’s biological mother had him evaluated in March 2014 and the speech \ntherapist recommended speech therapy twice a week, but the Contract Agency refused to provide \nthis service.  When Thierry E. entered a pre-kindergarten program, he started speech therapy \nonce a week.   \n39.  On May 13, 2014, during a visit at the Contract Agency, Plaintiff Thierry E.’s \nbiological mother noticed a severe rash while changing his diaper and reported this and other \nconcerns to the Family Court.  On June 21, 2014, the Family Court ordered that Thierry E. be \ntransferred to a new Contract Agency.  Thierry E. was moved to a second foster placement two \ndays later.  This foster placement is in the Bronx, even though Thierry E. and his biological \nmother had lived in Manhattan.  In approximately December 2015, Thierry E. reported to his \nbiological mother that his foster parent hit him.  Upon information and belief, an investigation of \nthis report is underway. \n40.  Plaintiff Thierry E. has now been in foster care for more than two years—over \nhalf his life.  This is a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate \ncase plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this \n15 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  1199  ooff  112299\nyoung boy to be returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, to ensure that he would grow up in a permanent family.   \n41.  Plaintiff Thierry E. has suffered emotional harm as a result of spending nearly \nhalf his life in ACS custody without a permanent family.  All indications are that he misses his \nbiological mother very much.  At the end of his once weekly visits with her, he cries \nuncontrollably.  When she expressed concern at this behavior, Thierry E.’s therapist told her that \nhe had to “get used to it” because this was “his life now”.  Upon information and belief, Thierry \nE. is experiencing more anxiety the longer he is without a permanent family. \n42.  ACS continues to fail to ensure that Plaintiff Thierry E. is receiving appropriate \nservices.  Although Thierry E. currently receives therapy, Thierry E.’s biological mother has \nexpressed concerns that the therapy being provided by the Contract Agency is focused on \nnormalizing Thierry E.’s separation from her rather than trying to help him prepare to be \nreturned to her care—even though his permanency goal remains to be returned to his parent.  \n43.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Thierry E. free from emotional harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nprofessional standards to place Thierry E. in a permanent home.   \n44.  Although ACS removed Plaintiff Thierry E. from his home over two years ago, \nthere has been no disposition of ACS’s neglect petition against Thierry E.’s biological mother.  \nThe fact-finding hearing began only in August 2015 after having been postponed several times.  \nThe fact-finding hearing then proceeded on non-consecutive dates in September, October and \nNovember 2015. The next fact-finding hearing date is in February 2016.  \n45.  Plaintiff Thierry E. had his first permanency hearing in December 2014—after he \nhad already been in ACS custody for over a year. \n16 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2200  ooff  112299\n46.  Plaintiff Thierry E.’s permanency goal remains to be returned to his parent.  His \nbiological mother wants nothing more than to finally bring her son home.  She has completed \nparenting classes, domestic violence counseling and multiple mental health evaluations in \naccordance with the two different Contract Agencies’ instructions.  In documents filed with the \nFamily Court, the Contract Agency has stated that Thierry E.’s biological mother “comes \nprepared to her visits with activities to do with her son and also tries to reinforce parenting skills \nthat will help her son’s vocabulary and pronunciation.”   \n47.  Since his removal over two years ago, ACS has made no effort to ensure that this \nlittle boy is returned to the mother he misses, and that his permanency goal—reunification with \nhis biological mother—is implemented as soon as possible.   \n48.  During the over two years that Plaintiff Thierry E. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision of \nappropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to \nwhich ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  \nAs a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Thierry E. has suffered and continues to \nsuffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where he will grow up \nand of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  Because of Defendants’ actions and \n17 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2211  ooff  112299\ninactions, Plaintiff Thierry E. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment. \n  Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. \n49.  Plaintiff Lucas T. is a seven year old boy in the second grade.  Plaintiff Ximena T. \nis a four year old girl in kindergarten.  Plaintiff Jose T.C. is a three year old boy.  Plaintiff \nValentina T.C. is a one year old girl.  ACS removed these children from their biological mother \non February 4, 2015.  Their permanency goal is to be returned to their parent.  They have been in \nACS custody for the past ten months. \n50.  Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. appear through their \nnext friend, Rachel Friedman.  Ms. Friedman is a tenth grade English teacher in Manhattan and \nhas been a teacher since 2008.  During her time as a teacher in New York City, Ms. Friedman \nhas worked primarily with low-income students and has taught students that are or were \npreviously in the custody of ACS.  Ms. Friedman is truly dedicated to Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose \nT.C. and Valentina T.C.’s best interests. \n51.  In November 2014, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. and their \nbiological mother began living in a rented room in an apartment in Queens in which they did not \nhave full use of the kitchen.  Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s biological \nmother cared for the children full time while Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina \nT.C.’s biological father worked and lived elsewhere.  Upon information and belief, because she \ndid not have full use of a kitchen, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s biological \nmother purchased cereal, fruit and prepared food for the children to eat.   \n18 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2222  ooff  112299\n52.  ACS removed Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. from \ntheir biological parents on February 4, 2015, reportedly due to their biological parents’ inability \nto adequately supervise and provide guardianship to the children because the children were left \nhome unattended, they had poor hygiene and there was an insufficient amount of food and \nformula at their home, without taking necessary steps or making reasonable efforts to determine \nwhether Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. could remain safely at home with \ntheir biological mother.  The children spent the night of February 4, 2015, at the Children’s \nCenter.   \n53.  The Contract Agency to which ACS had delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. \nfirst moved them to a foster placement in which the foster parents did not speak Spanish even \nthough Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. speak Spanish almost exclusively.  \nLucas T., the only one of his siblings in school at that time, was moved to a new school. \n54.  Upon information and belief, in May 2015, during a visit at the Contract Agency, \nPlaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s biological mother noticed \nbruising and lacerations on the children and reported this and other concerns to the Contract \nAgency.  On May 29, 2015, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. were removed \nfrom their foster placement and placed in two separate foster placements—Lucas T. and Jose \nT.C. are in one foster placement and Ximena T. and Valentina T.C. are in a second foster \nplacement.  Upon information and belief, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. see \neach other only during visits with their biological mother at the Contract Agency.   \n55.  Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. have now been in \nfoster care for over ten months.  This is a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement \n19 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2233  ooff  112299\nan appropriate case plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards \nto enable these young children to be returned to their biological mother or, if that were not \npossible within a reasonable period of time, to ensure that they would grow up in a permanent \nfamily.   \n56.  Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. have suffered \nemotional harm as a result of spending the past ten months in ACS custody without a permanent \nfamily.  All indications are that they miss their biological mother very much.  They are very \nexcited when they have their visits with their biological mother and ask when they can go home \nwith her. \n57.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and \nValentina T.C. free from emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take \nreasonable and appropriate steps consistent with professional standards to place Lucas T., \nXimena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. in a permanent home.   \n58.  Although ACS removed Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina \nT.C. from their home over ten months ago, there has been no fact-finding hearing or disposition \nof ACS’s neglect petition against their biological parents.   \n59.  Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s permanency goal \nremains to be returned to their parent.  Their biological mother wants nothing more than to bring \nher children home.  In February 2015, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s \nmother was told by ACS that she needed domestic relationship/family violence services, mental \nhealth/emotional stability services, parenting skills services and decision making/problem \nsolving skills services.  There are no allegations of domestic violence in the neglect petition \nagainst her.  According to the service agency providing her services, she “is participating in the \n20 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2244  ooff  112299\nentire service plan she has been assigned to”.  She completed a mental health evaluation in June \n2015, and has completed parenting classes and domestic violence counseling.  Upon information \nand belief, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C.’s biological mother was recently \ninformed that she has to undergo another psychological evaluation, which she has completed.   \n60.  Upon information and belief, soon after Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. \nand Valentina T.C. were placed in ACS custody, the Contract Agency informed their biological \nmother that it could not expedite reunification because she did not have suitable housing.  Upon \ninformation and belief, at that time, the Contract Agency provided her with no assistance to find \nsuitable housing.  Using her own limited resources, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and \nValentina T.C.’s biological mother secured a two bedroom apartment during the summer of \n2015.  Upon information and belief, she has had to move out of this housing because the home \nwas the subject of foreclosure proceedings and was sold.  Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and \nValentina T.C.’s biological mother now lives in a rented room in Queens.  Upon information and \nbelief, the Contract Agency has taken no steps to assist her in finding housing so her children can \ncome home.   \n61.  Since their removal over ten months ago, ACS has made no effort to ensure that \nthese young children are returned to the mother they miss, and that their permanency goal—\nreunification with their biological parent—is implemented as soon as possible.   \n62.  During the nearly one year that Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and \nValentina T.C. have been in the custody of ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated their \nconstitutional, statutory and contractual rights by failing to protect them from psychological and \nemotional harm; by failing to provide services to ensure their physical, psychological and \nemotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision of appropriate foster care placements \n21 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2255  ooff  112299\nconsistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable \nthem to be safely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, to place them in a permanent home.  ACS has further failed to \nexercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has \ndelegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, these children.  As a direct \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and Valentina T.C. \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm and continue to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of children being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where they will grow up and of believing that there is no family they can call their own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiffs Lucas T., Ximena T., Jose T.C. and \nValentina T.C. are being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from \nharm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy development. \nAyanna J. \n63.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. is a three year old girl in pre-kindergarten.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother on November 2, 2012—three days after she was born.  Her \npermanency goal currently is adoption.  She has been in ACS custody for over three years—\nvirtually her entire life. \n64.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. appears through her next friend, Meyghan McCrea.  Meyghan \nMcCrea is an attorney in private practice in New York City.  She was previously employed as a \nFamily Court Legal Services Attorney for ACS.  Ms. McCrea has known Ayanna J. since March \n2013 and has had regular contact with her since that time.  Ms. McCrea has met Ayanna J.’s \ncurrent foster parent and babysitter.  Ms. McCrea is truly dedicated to Ayanna J.’s best interests.  \n22 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2266  ooff  112299\n65.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. has two siblings:  (1) a nine year old sister, Alyssa L., and (2) \na sister, Angela L., who was beaten to death by her biological mother’s boyfriend in March 2010, \nwhen she was 19 months old.  Documents filed with the Family Court allege that, given Angela \nL.’s extensive injuries, Ayanna J.’s biological mother knew or should have known about the \nongoing abuse that her daughter suffered.  These documents also allege that Ayanna J.’s \nbiological mother delayed seeking medical care for Angela L., lied to hospital staff about the \nsource of the child’s injuries and instructed her other daughter, Alyssa L., who was then three \nand a half years old, to lie about what had occurred. \n66.  The day after Angela L. died, ACS filed a petition against Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s \nbiological mother alleging severe and repeated abuse.  In October 2012, the Family Court made a \nfinding of abuse against Ayanna J.’s biological mother.  On appeal in June 2014, the New York \nState Appellate Division found that Ayanna J.’s biological mother “severely abused [Angela L.] \nand derivatively severely abused the subject child [Alyssa L.]”. \n67.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. was born after her sister Angela L. died.  Due to the prior \nfinding of abuse against her biological mother, ACS placed Ayanna J. in ACS custody and in her \ncurrent foster placement on November 2, 2012—three days after she was born.  In March 2013, \nthe Family Court made a finding of derivative abuse as to Ayanna J. and on September 30, 2014, \nthe Family Court amended its finding to severe abuse as to Ayanna J. based on the Appellate \nDivision’s June 2014 finding. \n68.  Since being placed in foster care over three years ago, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has had \napproximately thirteen caseworkers at the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated her day-\nto-day care.  Upon information and belief, five of these caseworkers have been assigned to \nAyanna J. in the last six months.   \n23 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2277  ooff  112299\n69.  While in the custody of ACS, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has had supervised visits with \nher biological mother and father at the Contract Agency.  During one such visit in September \n2013, Ayanna J.’s biological father became angry and began screaming at Ayanna J.’s biological \nmother in front of Ayanna J.  Upon information and belief, at least one Contract Agency visit \nwas discontinued because Ayanna J.’s biological parents were fighting.  Ayanna J.’s biological \nfather has not visited her since April 2014.  Upon information and belief, visits at Ayanna J.’s \nbiological mother’s home were suspended after she threatened to physically assault a \ncaseworker.  Ayanna J. continues to have supervised visits with her biological mother twice per \nweek at the Contract Agency.  During one such visit in July 2014, Ayanna J.’s biological mother \nallowed her biological father to speak with Ayanna J. over the phone despite such contact being \nprohibited. \n70.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. has languished in the custody of ACS for the past three \nyears—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and \nprovide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young girl to be \nsafely returned to her biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of \ntime, to ensure that she can grow up in a permanent family. \n71.  As a result of her continued placement in ACS custody, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has \nsuffered great emotional harm.  In 2013, Ayanna J. cried hysterically during supervised visits \nwith her biological mother at the Contract Agency.  Now that she is older, Ayanna J. expresses \nthe desire to not attend visits with her biological mother, will not leave her babysitter to visit \nwith her biological mother, or will ask for her babysitter in the middle of a visit with her \nbiological mother.  These visits have caused and continue to cause great stress, confusion and \npsychological harm to this young child.  \n24 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2288  ooff  112299\n72.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Ayanna J. free from emotional harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nreasonable professional standards to place Ayanna J. in a permanent home.   \n73.  On April 9, 2014, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s permanency goal was changed from return \nto parent to adoption.  Her current foster parent has indicated a willingness to adopt her.   \n74.  A petition for termination of parental rights (“TPR”) was filed on April 28, 2014, \nafter Plaintiff Ayanna J. already had been in foster care for almost one and a half years.  The \nTPR proceedings were adjourned repeatedly due to ACS’s failure to ensure that all parties were \nprepared for court on scheduled hearing dates to resolve the permanency issues in this case.  On \nApril 27, 2015, almost a year after the TPR petition was filed, the assigned Family Court judge \nheard one day of testimony related to the TPR proceeding and continued the case until mid-June \n2015.  The next day, that Family Court judge was reassigned to another court.  On June 22, 2015, \nPlaintiff Ayanna J.’s TPR proceeding was re-assigned to a new Family Court judge, who \ndeclared a mistrial and postponed a new trial.  To date, no further testimony on this petition has \nbeen heard.   \n75.  After languishing in foster care for three years, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s permanency \ngoal remains to be adopted.   \n76.  During the over three years that Plaintiff Ayanna J.  has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect her from psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \n25 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  2299  ooff  112299\nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to \nwhich ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  \nAs a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Ayanna J. has suffered and continues to \nsuffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Ayanna J. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment.  \nOlivia R. and Ana-Maria R.   \n77.  Plaintiff Olivia R. is a six year old girl in the first grade, and Plaintiff Ana-Maria \nR. is a five year old girl in kindergarten.  ACS removed them from their biological mother’s \nhome on June 8, 2011.  The permanency goal for both children currently is adoption.  They have \nbeen in ACS custody for more than four years.  \n78.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. appear through their next friend, Dawn Cardi.  \nMs. Cardi is an attorney in private practice in New York City, specializing in criminal and family \nlaw.  She is appointed and has served as a certified Law Guardian in the First Department of the \nAppellate Division, representing children in complex family law proceedings.  She is truly \ndedicated to Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s best interests. \n79.  Upon information and belief, this is Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s second \ntime in ACS custody.  Upon information and belief, ACS removed Olivia and Ana-Maria R. \nfrom their biological parents in January 2011, they spent a few months in a foster placement and \n26 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3300  ooff  112299\nthen ACS returned them home.  On June 8, 2011, when Olivia R. was two years old and Ana-\nMaria R. was eight months old, ACS again removed the girls from their home and placed them \ninto ACS custody, reportedly due to domestic violence between their biological parents and their \nbiological mother’s alcohol and drug use.   \n80.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. initially placed them in a non-\nkinship foster placement—the third place they had been moved to in six months.   \n81.  In March 2012, the Contract Agency returned Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. \nto their biological mother on a trial basis.  In June 2012, their biological mother dropped them \noff at the foster placement where they had been living and did not return to pick them up.  She \ndid not visit the children again until July 24, 2012. \n82.  ACS has allowed Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. to be bounced in and out of \nfoster care for almost the entirety of their young lives, and they now have been in ACS custody \nfor the past four years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate \ncase plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable these \nyoung girls to be safely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, to ensure that they can grow up in a permanent family. \n83.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered physical and emotional abuse \nwhile in ACS custody.  In October 2013, Olivia R., who was four years old at the time, was \nsexually abused by her biological mother’s friend during an unsupervised visit.  Ana-Maria R. \nwas present during that abuse.  Although the Contract Agency was made aware of this abuse at \nthat time, upon information and belief, neither the Contract Agency nor ACS took any action in \nresponse to the report.  More recently, Olivia R. reported the incident to her therapist, who (as a \n27 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3311  ooff  112299\nmandated reporter) informed the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment \nand the police, and an investigation is underway.  Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s biological mother \nhas not visited with the children since November 26, 2014. \n84.  As a result of the emotional harm they have suffered while in ACS custody for the \npast four years, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered and continue to suffer from a \nvariety of mental health problems.  Olivia R.’s diagnoses include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder, Developmental Coordination Disorder and Disruptive Behavior Disorder.  She is in a \nspecial education setting at school.  Ana-Maria R.’s diagnoses include Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder, Anger Management, and Conduct Disorder.  She is in a special \neducation setting at school.    \n85.  Since being placed in ACS custody, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have \nsuffered severe emotional and behavioral problems.  Olivia R. has developed serious trust issues \nand she would wet the bed before any visit with her biological mother.  Ana-Maria R. \ndemonstrates severe hyperactivity and aggression.  In her pre-kindergarten program, she often \nwould hit her teacher, tear things off the wall or break other items.  In January 2015, her pre-\nkindergarten program would not allow her to attend classes until she was medicated for these \nbehavioral problems.  Although her doctor has recommended that she be given medication, upon \ninformation and belief, she has been unable to start taking medication because the Contract \nAgency has not approved it.  \n86.  ACS has failed to ensure that Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. are provided \nwith the necessary and appropriate services to ensure their physical, psychological and emotional \nwell-being.  One of their caseworkers recommended that the girls enroll in Bridges to Health \nProgram (“B2H”)—a Medicaid waiver program that provides support for children in foster care \n28 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3322  ooff  112299\nwho are medically fragile, have a developmental disability or are severely emotionally disturbed.  \nUpon information and belief, when their foster mother initially requested these services, the \nContract Agency declined to submit the request because an agency caseworker said “that’s a lot \nof paperwork”.  Upon information and belief, Olivia and Ana-Maria R. still do not have all of the \nB2H services for which they have been approved, including speech therapy and education \nassistance. \n87.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. free from \nphysical, psychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS also has failed to take \nreasonable and appropriate steps consistent with reasonable professional standards to place \nOlivia and Ana-Maria R. in a permanent home.   \n88.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s permanency goal was not changed from \nreturn to parent to adoption until March 1, 2014—after they had been in ACS custody for almost \nthree years.  TPR petitions were filed approximately eight months later in November 2014.  \nUpon information and belief, on May 28, 2015, the Family Court judge handling Olivia and Ana-\nMaria R.’s case made an oral statement that parental rights would be terminated; however, \nbecause none of the attorneys present had drafted a proposed order, that ruling was not finalized \nand Olivia and Ana-Maria R. were not freed for adoption at that time.  Upon information and \nbelief, since then, Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have been freed for adoption.  Olivia and Ana-Maria \nR.’s current foster mother has indicated a willingness to adopt them and has submitted \npaperwork to proceed with the adoption.  Upon information and belief, the Contract Agency has \nnot provided clear instructions regarding what paperwork, classes and other information are \nnecessary to complete the adoption, and has directed Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s foster mother to \nsubmit to steps that are not requirements or steps that have already been completed.  On \n29 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3333  ooff  112299\nNovember 27, 2015, the Family Court judge informed the Contract Agency that it must provide \nclear, written instructions regarding the adoption process to Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s foster \nmother.  Upon information and belief, the Contract Agency has not yet done so.  \n89.  During the more than four years that Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have \nbeen in the custody of ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated their constitutional, statutory \nand contractual rights by failing to protect them from physical, psychological and emotional \nharm; by failing to provide services to ensure their physical, psychological and emotional well-\nbeing; by failing to ensure the provision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with \nprofessional standards or of a meaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable them to be \nsafely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to place them in a permanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and \nmeaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day \ncare of, and case planning responsibility for, these children.  As a direct result of Defendants’ \nactions and inactions, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered and continue to suffer \nirreparable harm and continue to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of children being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where they will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family they can call their own.  Because of Defendants’ \nactions and inactions, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. are being deprived of the opportunity \nfor a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability \nand healthy development.  \n30 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3344  ooff  112299\nXavion M.   \n90.  Plaintiff Xavion M. is a six year old boy in the first grade.  ACS removed him \nfrom his biological mother due to an allegation of neglect 15 days after he was born.  He has \nbeen in ACS custody for over six years—nearly his entire life. \n91.  Plaintiff Xavion M. appears through his next friend, Michael B. Mushlin.  Mr. \nMushlin is a Law Professor at Pace University School of Law in New York City, where he has \ntaught for the last 30 years.  His scholarship has included maltreatment of children in foster care.  \nPreviously, he worked as a public interest and civil rights lawyer for 15 years as a staff attorney \nwith Harlem Assertion of Rights, Inc., as a staff attorney and Project Director of the Prisoners \nRights Project of the Legal Aid Society, and as Associate Director of the Children’s Rights \nProject of the American Civil Liberties Union.  He is truly dedicated to Xavion M.’s best \ninterests. \n92.  Plaintiff Xavion M. is not the only child that ACS has removed from his \nbiological mother and placed into foster care.   Xavion M. has two siblings:  (1) a 13 year old \nbrother, Vincent D., and (2) an 11 year old sister, Zahara D.  Xavion M.’s siblings have been in \nACS custody for the past six years.  Upon information and belief, at least one Family Court \njudge has referred to these two children as “unadoptable” and their permanency goals remain that \nthey be returned to their parent.  \n93.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young boy first placed Plaintiff Xavion M. with a fictive kin \nfoster parent, who was a friend of his biological mother.  On December 21, 2011, when Xavion \nM. was just two years old, he was moved to a second, non-kinship, foster placement.  When he \narrived, he was anemic and malnourished.  He resided in this foster placement for well over three \n31 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3355  ooff  112299\nyears.  On August 26, 2015, the Contract Agency removed Xavion M. from this foster placement \nand returned him to his biological mother on a trial basis.  That Xavion M. has bounced in and \nout of foster placements is a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an \nappropriate case plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to \nenable this young boy to be safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible \nwithin a reasonable period of time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n94.  Since being placed in foster care over six years ago, Plaintiff Xavion M. has had \napproximately four caseworkers at the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated his care and \ncase planning. \n95.  Plaintiff Xavion M., who has been in ACS custody for over six years, had weekly \nsupervised visits with his biological mother and older siblings prior to July 2015.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Xavion M.’s brother hit and kicked him during one such visit.  In July \n2015, Xavion M. started attending weekend, overnight visits with his biological mother.  Upon \ninformation and belief, during one such visit, Xavion M.’s biological mother took him to a home \nin which his biological father resides, whom Xavion M. is not permitted to see because of an \norder of protection.  \n96.  The Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, this boy has not provided Plaintiff Xavion M. with necessary \nservices for his physical and emotional well-being.  Although his teacher recommended that an \nIndividualized Education Program (“IEP”) be written for him, Xavion M. did not receive the \nevaluation necessary for many months because his biological mother refused to give consent. \n97.  As a result of the over six years that Plaintiff Xavion M. has spent in ACS \ncustody, Xavion M. has suffered severe emotional damage.  He has exhibited behavioral \n32 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3366  ooff  112299\nproblems, including becoming aggressive and violent at home and at school; he also is having \ndifficulty concentrating at school.  At five years old, he would only sleep in the same bed as his \nfoster mother and would not sleep through the night.  Although Xavion M. was attending regular \ntherapy sessions, upon information and belief, he has not attended these sessions since August \n2015.     \n98.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Xavion M. free from physical, \npsychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable \nand appropriate steps consistent with reasonable professional standards to place Xavion M. in a \npermanent home.   \n99.  On July 21, 2014—after Plaintiff Xavion M. had been in foster care for almost \nfive years—Xavion M.’s permanency goal was changed from return to parent to adoption.  This \ngoal change occurred only after the Family Court judge handling Xavion M. and his siblings’ \ncase instructed Xavion M.’s caseworkers at the Contract Agency to file a petition to terminate \nthe parental rights of Xavion M.’s biological mother and begin adoption proceedings.  Xavion \nM.’s foster mother at that time indicated a willingness to adopt him.   \n100.  No TPR petition was filed and the Contract Agency continued to pursue plans to \nreturn Xavion M. to his biological mother after first returning Xavion M.’s older siblings to his \nmother on a trial basis.  Indeed, papers filed in Family Court in March 2015 state that the \n“Agency is working with [biological mother] for reunification”.  At a family team conference on \nJune 24, 2015, the Contract Agency said it intended to pursue granting Xavion M.’s biological \nmother unsupervised visits despite the fact that Xavion M.’s therapist had stated that Xavion M. \nwas not ready for this and that Xavion M.’s permanency goal was adoption.   \n33 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3377  ooff  112299\n101.  Upon information and belief, on July 29, 2015, the Contract Agency informed the \nFamily Court judge that it wanted to return Xavion M. to his biological mother on a trial basis \nimmediately.  Upon information and belief, the Family Court judge informed the Contract \nAgency that it could do so only after Xavion M. had one month of weekend, overnight visits \nwith his biological mother and upon 28 days’ notice.   \n102.  On August 26, 2015, Xavion M. was returned to his biological mother on a trial \nbasis.  The long-standing inconsistency in planning for this child’s future is increasing the \ninsecurity and emotional damage this child is experiencing in foster care. \n103.  During the over six years that Plaintiff Xavion M. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Xavion M. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Xavion M. is being deprived of the \n34 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3388  ooff  112299\nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development. \nDameon C. \n104.  Plaintiff Dameon C. is a four year old boy with special needs.  ACS removed him \nfrom his biological mother, who was then incarcerated, nine days after he was born.  His \npermanency goal currently is adoption.  He has been in ACS custody for over four years—nearly \nhis entire life. \n105.  Plaintiff Dameon C. appears through his next friend, Reverend Doctor \nGwendolyn Hadley-Hall.  Reverend Doctor Hadley-Hall is an associate pastor at Christ Temple \nUnited Baptist Church in Brooklyn.  Prior to entering the ministry, Reverend Doctor Hadley-Hall \nwas a teacher at public elementary schools in New York City for 30 years.  She is truly dedicated \nto Dameon C.’s best interests. \n106.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this boy first placed Plaintiff Dameon C. in a non-kinship foster \nplacement. \n107.  On Christmas Eve 2011, when Plaintiff Dameon C. was nine months old, he was \nreturned to his mother on a trial basis when she was released from jail.  They were placed in a \nmother-child drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.  His former foster parent would often take \nDameon C. for two to three weeks at a time with his biological mother’s consent because \nDameon C.’s behavior deteriorated drastically when he was moved to his biological mother’s \ncare.  He began banging his head, which he continues to do now at age four.  In July 2012, his \nbiological mother was expelled from the rehabilitation center and Dameon C. was returned to his \nformer foster placement, where he remains to this day.  He has been in foster care virtually his \n35 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  3399  ooff  112299\nentire life—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan \nand provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy \nto be safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable \nperiod of time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n108.  While in ACS custody, Plaintiff Dameon C. has had regular visits with his \nbiological mother.  In February 2014, when Dameon C. was almost three years old, his \nbiological mother kicked him during the first unsupervised overnight visit at her drug treatment \nfacility.  Although she is still permitted to have supervised visits with him, she did not have \ncontact with Dameon C. between December 2014 and April 23, 2015, at which time she began \nattending supervised visits with Dameon C. again.  However, during the summer of 2015, \nDameon C.’s biological mother disappeared from her drug treatment program and has not \nconsistently attended visits with him or contacted him since. \n109.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Dameon C. safe from physical abuse and \nemotional damage, ACS has also failed to ensure that he is provided with necessary services to \nensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being.  Although he has been diagnosed \nwith Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and has been \napproved to receive services through B2H, he is on a waiting list for those services. \n110.  ACS also has failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps to place Plaintiff \nDameon C. in a permanent home.  Dameon C.’s permanency goal was not changed to adoption \nuntil November 3, 2014—after he had already been in ACS custody for over three and a half \nyears.  A TPR petition was filed thereafter.  Plaintiff Dameon C.’s next court date had been \nscheduled for June 2, 2015, but was postponed until November 2015, at which time it was \npostponed until February 2016.  \n36 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4400  ooff  112299\n111.  During the over four years that Plaintiff Dameon C. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Dameon C. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Dameon C. is being deprived of the \nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development.  \nTyrone M. \n112.  Plaintiff Tyrone M. is a seven year old boy with special needs.  ACS removed \nhim from his biological mother 12 days after he was born.  His permanency goal currently is \nadoption.  He has been in ACS custody for over seven years—nearly his entire life. \n113.  Plaintiff Tyrone M. appears through his next friend, Bishop Lillian Robinson-\nWiltshire.  Bishop Robinson-Wiltshire is the Senior Pastor and Overseer of Cathedral of Christ \nCommunity Ministries in Brooklyn.  Prior to entering the ministry 30 years ago, Bishop \n37 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4411  ooff  112299\nRobinson-Wiltshire was a family counselor and worked with families dealing with abuse and \nneglect.  Bishop Robinson-Wiltshire has also served as a foster parent to older children.  She is \ntruly dedicated to Tyrone M.’s best interests. \n114.  Twelve days after he was born, ACS removed Plaintiff Tyrone M. from his \nbiological mother when she tested positive for cocaine after giving birth to him.   \n115.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young boy first placed Plaintiff Tyrone M. in a kinship foster \nplacement with his aunt.  On June 23, 2014, ACS removed him from his aunt’s home after she \nfailed a random drug screening.  The Contract Agency then placed him in a non-kinship foster \nplacement where he currently resides.  Tyrone M. has now spent nearly his entire life in ACS \ncustody—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and \nprovide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy to \nbe safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n116.  ACS also has also failed to keep Plaintiff Tyrone M. free from physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm while in its custody.  When he arrived at his current foster \nplacement, his health and behavior indicated severe neglect.  He suffered from severe dental \nproblems.  He went to sleep in his clothing every night because in his previous foster placement \nhe had not been provided with such basic care as being taught to undress or change into pajamas \nbefore bed.   \n117.  As a result of the emotional harm he has suffered while in ACS custody for the \npast seven years, Plaintiff Tyrone M. suffered and continues to suffer from a variety of mental \nhealth problems.  His diagnoses include Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Developmental \n38 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4422  ooff  112299\nCoordination Disorder, Communication Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  \nTyrone M. also exhibits severe behavioral problems and often becomes violent at school and \nthrows chairs or pencils.  As a result, his school has barred him from eating in the lunchroom \nwith other students and from attending school-sponsored field trips.   \n118.  ACS has also failed to ensure that Plaintiff Tyrone M. is provided with the \nnecessary services to ensure his physical and emotional well-being.  Although he has been \napproved to receive services through B2H, he is on a waiting list for those services. \n119.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Tyrone M. physically free from harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nreasonable professional standards to place Tyrone M. in a permanent home.   \n120.  After Plaintiff Tyrone M. had been in foster care for over seven years, his \nbiological mother voluntarily surrendered her parental rights.  Although he is now free to be \nadopted, it is not clear that he will be adopted by his current foster parent and, upon information \nand belief, the Contract Agency, ACS and Tyrone M.’s law guardian have not sought out other \nadoption possibilities for Tyrone M. to have a permanent home and family to call his own. \n121.  During the over seven years that Plaintiff Tyrone M. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.

As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Tyrone M. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Tyrone M. is being deprived of the \nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development. \nBrittney W. \n122.  Plaintiff Brittney W. is a seven year old girl with special needs.  ACS removed \nher from her biological mother and placed her into ACS custody on May 10, 2011.  Her \npermanency goal currently is to be returned to her parent.  She has been in ACS custody for over \nfour years—most of her life. \n123.  Plaintiff Brittney W. appears through her next friend, Liza Camellerie.  Ms. \nCamellerie is an attorney in private practice in New York City.  She currently serves on the \nassigned panel for Family Court in Manhattan, representing children and parents in Article 10 \ncases, among others.  She also spent six years as a Family Court Legal Services (“FCLS”) \nAttorney for ACS, four of which were spent as a supervisor to 25 to 30 other FCLS attorneys.  \nMs. Camellerie is truly dedicated to Brittney W.’s best interests. \n124.  Shortly after Plaintiff Brittney W. was born, a report was called in to the \nStatewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment alleging that her biological \nmother’s own mental incapacity and developmental delays prevented her from caring for her \n40 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4444  ooff  112299\ninfant daughter.  Brittney W. was placed into voluntary kinship care with her biological mother’s \nniece by agreement with ACS. \n125.  On May 10, 2011, when Plaintiff Brittney W. was two years old, ACS remanded \nher into its custody because her biological mother’s niece could no longer care for Brittney W. \n126.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young girl then placed Plaintiff Brittney W. in a non-kinship \nfoster placement.  She has been residing in this foster placement for over four years—a direct \nresult of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and provide \nappropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young girl to be safely \nreturned to her biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, \nto ensure that she can grow up in a permanent family. \n127.  After over four years in foster care, Plaintiff Brittney W.’s permanency goal is to \nbe returned to her parent.  Upon information and belief, Brittney W.’s lawyer does not think that \nher biological mother’s mental incapacities allow her to provide appropriate care for Brittney W.  \nUpon information and belief, the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated the care and case \nplanning responsibility for this child has taken the position that Brittney W.’s biological mother \ncan provide care if she has 24-hour medical support.   \n128.  In September 2015, Brittney W.’s biological mother was assigned a part-time \nhome health attendant, and, soon after, Brittney W. started once a week, four-day, overnight \nvisits with her mother.  Upon information and belief, Brittney W.’s biological mother was unable \nto ensure that Brittney W. got to and from school on time and, in October 2015, allowed a \nstranger to transport Brittney W. to her foster placement.  Upon information and belief, during a \nrecent visit, Brittney W.’s biological mother struck Brittney W. across the face.  Upon \n41 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4455  ooff  112299\ninformation and belief, the Contract Agency has terminated overnight visits because of this, \nhowever it intends to proceed with returning Brittney W. to her biological mother on a trial basis.  \nBrittney W.’s current foster mother has indicated a willingness to adopt her.  No TPR petition \nhas been filed.  \n129.  During the over four years that Plaintiff Brittney W. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Brittney W. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where she will grow up and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Brittney W. is being deprived of the \nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development. \n42 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4466  ooff  112299\nMikayla G. \n130.  Plaintiff Mikayla G. is a two year old girl.  ACS removed her from her biological \nmother on November 21, 2013.  Her permanency goal currently is adoption.  She has been in \nACS custody for the past two years—nearly her entire life.  \n131.   Plaintiff Mikayla G. appears through her next friend, Amy Mulzer.  As discussed \nsupra, Ms. Mulzer is an Acting Assistant Professor of Lawyering at New York University \nSchool of Law.  The primary focus of her research includes:  Adoption, Child Welfare, Family \nLaw, Parental Rights and Poverty Law.  Prior to joining the lawyering faculty at NYU, Ms. \nMulzer spent five years representing low-income parents whose children were in foster care or at \nrisk of being placed in foster care, first as a staff attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services and \nthen as an appellate attorney on the assigned counsel panel for the Appellate Division, Second \nDepartment.  Ms. Mulzer is truly dedicated to Mikayla G.’s best interests. \n132.  Upon information and belief, on November 20, 2013, Plaintiff Mikayla G.’s \nbiological mother, then an 18 year old who had formerly been in the custody of ACS and who \nwas struggling to financially support herself and her four month old child, arranged for childcare \nso that she could go to the Human Resources Administration to arrange for childcare, housing \nand other benefits.  Upon information and belief, thereafter, she went to several grocery stores to \nuse her Women, Infants, and Children benefits (“WIC”) to purchase formula Mikayla G. needed \nfor colic.  Upon information and belief, upon her return to pick up her child, Mikayla G.’s \nbiological mother was told that Mikayla G. had been taken to a family member’s home.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Mikayla G.’s biological mother was told that an ACS caseworker would \nnot allow her in her family member’s home.  The next day, Mikayla G.’s biological mother was \ntold that Mikayla G. was being removed from her custody. \n43 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4477  ooff  112299\n133.  ACS removed Plaintiff Mikayla G. without taking necessary steps or making \nreasonable efforts to determine whether Mikayla G. could remain safely at home with her \nbiological mother.  Although Mikayla G.’s biological mother had contact with ACS between \nJuly and November 2013, no preventive services case was ever opened and a report made to the \nStatewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment came back “unfounded”.  Upon \ninformation and belief, ACS removed Mikayla G. without offering Mikayla G.’s biological \nmother the services that would have allowed Mikayla G. to remain safely at home with her. \n134.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiff Mikayla G. initially placed her in a non-kinship foster \nplacement.  The foster mother did not provide Mikayla G. with the appropriate formula.  Upon \ninformation and belief, in approximately December 2013, the Contract Agency moved Mikayla \nG. to a new foster placement because the foster mother in her first foster placement was not \nappropriately feeding Mikayla G.  Upon information and belief, Mikayla G. is one of many \nchildren living in this second foster placement. \n135.  Plaintiff Mikayla G. has now been in foster care for two years—nearly her entire \nlife.  This is a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan \nand provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young girl \nto be returned to her biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of \ntime, to ensure that she would grow up in a permanent family. \n136.  Plaintiff Mikayla G. has had three caseworkers and two supervisors during her \ntime in ACS custody. \n137.  Plaintiff Mikayla G. has suffered emotional harm as a result of spending nearly \nher entire life in ACS custody without a permanent family.  All indications are that she misses \n44 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4488  ooff  112299\nher biological mother very much.  Mikayla G. visits once a week with her biological mother and \nasks at the end of every visit if she can go home with her.  Upon information and belief, Mikayla \nG.’s biological mother has expressed concern that Mikayla G. is confused about her placement in \nfoster care and has asked the Contract Agency to provide services to address this.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the Contract Agency has not provided any services to address this issue.  \n138.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Mikayla G. free from emotional harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nprofessional standards to place Mikayla G. in a permanent home.   \n139.  On or about March 2, 2015, Plaintiff Mikayla G.’s permanency goal was changed \nfrom return to parent to adoption.  On April 28, 2015, a TPR petition was filed.  Upon \ninformation and belief, in June 2015, the Family Court judge handling Mikayla G.’s case ordered \nthat Mikayla G.’s permanency goal be changed back to return to parent.  The Contract Agency is \nproceeding with adjudication of the TPR petition and the trial is scheduled to begin in February \n2016.   \n140.  Plaintiff Mikayla G.’s biological mother wants nothing more than to finally bring \nher daughter home.  When Mikayla G. was removed, Mikayla G.’s biological mother was \nordered to attend parenting classes, attend a drug treatment program and find stable housing.  \nUpon information and belief, Mikayla G.’s biological mother was not provided with any \nassistance in finding a parenting class.  She identified one herself and completed it in nine weeks.  \nMikayla G.’s biological mother was referred to a drug treatment program for her marijuana use.  \nUpon information and belief, she has been in and out of drug treatment programs and she has \ncommunicated to the Contract Agency that she intends to begin an outpatient drug program again \nsoon.  Upon information and belief, the Contract Agency has told Mikayla G.’s biological \n45 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  4499  ooff  112299\nmother that she cannot meet with its housing specialist to help find her stable housing until she \nhas completed her outpatient drug treatment program.  Due to her inability to find affordable and \nstable housing, Mikayla G.’s biological mother lived in an abandoned house with other family \nmembers for a number of months.  Mikayla G.’s biological mother now lives with friends.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the Family Court judge and Contract Agency caseworker handling \nMikayla G.’s case told her to give finding work and housing lower priority than her drug \ntreatment. \n141.  If Plaintiff Mikayla G. is unable to be returned to her parent, Mikayla G.’s \nbiological mother would like her to be placed with a relative.  Upon information and belief, since \nher removal over two years ago, neither ACS nor the Contract Agency has made efforts to \ndetermine whether this little girl’s relatives may be appropriate foster or adoptive placements \neven though family members have presented themselves to ACS and the Contract Agency as \noptions for placement.   \n142.  During the more than two years that Plaintiff Mikayla G. has been in the custody \nof ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights \nby failing to protect her from psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to \nwhich ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  \nAs a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Mikayla G. has suffered and continues to \n46 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5500  ooff  112299\nsuffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Mikayla G. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment.  \nMyls J. and Malik M. \n143.  Plaintiff Myls J. is a five year old boy in kindergarten, and Plaintiff Malik M. is a \nthree year old boy in pre-kindergarten.  Myls J. and Malik M. are brothers.  Myls J. was removed \nfrom his biological mother on March 14, 2011.  Malik M. was removed from his biological \nmother on April 4, 2012, just two days after he was born.  The permanency goal for both \nchildren currently is adoption.  Myls J. has been in ACS custody for more than four years and \nMalik M. has been in custody for over three and a half years—nearly his entire life. \n144.   Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. appear through their next friend, Elizabeth \nHendrix.  Ms. Hendrix worked as a special education teacher in public schools for several years \nbefore specializing in how to teach children with dyslexia or other reading disabilities, both in \npublic schools and private tutoring.  Ms. Hendrix is truly dedicated to Myls J. and Malik M.’s \nbest interests. \n145.  Upon information and belief, shortly after Plaintiff Myls J. was born, his \nbiological mother, then a 15 year old girl who had formerly been in the custody of ACS, left him \nwith her grandmother.  Upon information and belief, Myls J.’s biological great-grandmother \nreported to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment that Myls J.’s \nbiological mother had abandoned him.    \n47 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5511  ooff  112299\n146.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiff Myls J. initially placed him in a non-kinship emergency \nfoster placement.  Myls J. was then placed in a non-kinship foster placement—the third place he \nhad lived in one month.   \n147.  When Plaintiff Malik M. was born, the Contract Agency to which ACS delegated \nthe day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, Malik M. placed him in the same \nnon-kinship foster placement as Myls J.  Malik M. reportedly was removed from his biological \nmother because of her problems with drug and alcohol use.  \n148.  In the past four years, Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. have had approximately \ntwelve caseworkers at the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated their day-to-day care. \n149.  Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. had sporadic supervised visits with their \nbiological mother at the Contract Agency until approximately August 2012 when their biological \nmother stopped attending visits.  Upon information and belief, Myls J. did not visit his biological \nmother at all in 2013, and Malik M. visited with his biological mother only once in 2013.   In \n2014, neither Myls J. nor Malik M. visited their biological mother.  On July 31, 2015, Myls J. \nand Malik M. saw their biological mother for the first time since 2013.  In November 2015, the \nFamily Court judge handling Myls J. and Malik M.’s case suspended visits with their biological \nmother. \n150.  Plaintiff Myls J. has languished in the custody of ACS for over four years and his \nbrother Plaintiff Malik M. has languished in the custody of ACS for nearly his entire life—a \ndirect result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and provide \nappropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable these young boys to be \n48 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5522  ooff  112299\nsafely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to ensure that they can grow up in a permanent family. \n151.  As a result of their continued placement in ACS custody, Plaintiffs Myls J. and \nMalik M. have suffered great physical and emotional harm.  Although a doctor has prescribed \nMyls J. medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and to address his problems \nsleeping, he was unable to start this medication until a year after it was prescribed because the \nContract Agency was unable to locate his biological mother so that she could give consent.  \nAdditionally, Myls J. and Malik M.’s visits with their biological mother caused them severe \nanxiety.  Soon after visits began in 2015, Myls J. began screaming and crying at school.  Malik \nM. had previously seen his biological mother only twice before, when he was approximately two \nmonths old, and was confused about who she was.   \n152.  As a result of the emotional harm they have suffered while in ACS custody for the \npast four years, Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. have suffered and continue to suffer from a \nvariety of mental health problems.  Myls J.’s diagnoses include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder, Autistic Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder.  He is in a special education \nsetting at school.  Malik M. also is in a special education early education program.    \n153.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. free from emotional \nharm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent \nwith reasonable professional standards to place Myls J. and Malik M. in a permanent home.   \n154.  On October 10, 2012, the Contract Agency determined that Plaintiffs Myls J. and \nMalik M.’s permanency goal should be changed from return to parent to adoption.  Their current \nfoster parent has indicated a willingness to adopt them. \n49 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5533  ooff  112299\n155.  A petition for TPR was filed on or about June 12, 2013.  Upon information and \nbelief, the TPR proceedings have been adjourned repeatedly due to ACS’s failure to ensure that \nall parties were prepared for court on scheduled hearing dates to resolve the permanency issues \nin this case.  The TPR proceedings are currently scheduled to begin on March 1, 2016. \n156.  After languishing in foster care for over three years, Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik \nM.’s permanency goal remains to be adopted. \n157.  During the more than three years that Plaintiffs Myls J. and Malik M. have been \nin the custody of ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated their constitutional, statutory and \ncontractual rights by failing to protect them from psychological and emotional harm; by failing \nto provide services to ensure their physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing \nto ensure the provision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional \nstandards or of a meaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable them to be safely returned to \ntheir biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place \nthem in a permanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful \noversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, these children.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and \ninactions, Myls J. and Malik M. have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm and \ncontinue to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a consequence of children being \nharmed while in foster care, of not knowing where they will grow up and of believing that there \nis no family they can call their own.  Because of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiffs \nMyls J. and Malik M. are being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is reasonably \nfree from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy development.  \n50 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5544  ooff  112299\nEmmanuel S. and Matthew V. \n158.  Plaintiff Emmanuel S. is a 14 year old boy in the ninth grade, and Plaintiff \nMatthew V. is a 13 year old boy in the eighth grade.  Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. are brothers.  \nThe permanency goal for both children currently is adoption.  They have been in ACS custody \nfor more than four years.    \n159.  Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. appear by their next friend, Samuel \nPerry.  Mr. Perry is a high school history and government teacher.  Mr. Perry started his career \nteaching students in special education classes and currently mentors a student who was \npreviously in the custody of ACS.  Mr. Perry is truly dedicated to Emmanuel S. and Matthew \nV.’s best interests. \n160.  Upon information and belief, this is Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s \nsecond time in ACS custody.  Upon information and belief, ACS removed the children from \ntheir biological parents and then returned them home.  On September 19, 2011, when Emmanuel \nS. was ten years old and Matthew V. was nine years old, ACS removed Emmanuel S. and \nMatthew V. and placed them in ACS custody again, reportedly because of their biological \nmother’s mental health issues and drug use.  Emmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s biological father \nsuffers from Alzheimer’s disease and is unable to care for the children.  When the children were \nplaced in ACS custody, the Family Court entered a temporary order of protection prohibiting \nEmmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s biological mother from contacting them because of her mental \nhealth issues and drug use. \n161.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, these children placed Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. in a \n51 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5555  ooff  112299\nkinship foster placement with their cousin.  At that time, their permanency goal was to be \nreturned to their parent.  They remain in that kinship foster placement with their cousin.  \n162.  Upon information and belief, from October 2011 to March 2013, Plaintiffs \nEmmanuel S. and Matthew V. had occasional visitation with their biological mother.  During at \nleast one such visit, Emmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s biological mother brought with her to a visit \na man who is prohibited by court order from being around the children.  Upon information and \nbelief, Emmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s visitation with their biological mother has become \nsporadic because of their reluctance to visit with her or have other contact with her. \n163.    Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. have languished in the custody of ACS \nfor the past four years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate \ncase plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable these \nyoung boys to be safely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, to ensure that they can grow up in a permanent family. \n164.  As a result of their continued placement in ACS custody, Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. \nand Matthew V. have suffered severe emotional trauma.   \n165.  In June 2012, Plaintiff Emmanuel S. was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with \ndepressed mood with moderate psychosocial stressors caused by conflicts between his biological \nmother and foster parent.  In October 2013, the Contract Agency reported that Emmanuel S. \nexperienced “emotional turmoil” over the course of the previous year and was disturbed by his \ninability to effectively communicate with his biological mother to express his feelings in a way \nshe would consider.  During this time, Emmanuel S.’s biological mother would also contact him \nat inappropriate times and in inappropriate places, such as when he was at school.  Because of \nthese events, Emmanuel S. began attending mental health counseling sessions once a week as \n52 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5566  ooff  112299\nopposed to twice a month.  In March 2015, Emmanuel S. was diagnosed with adjustment \ndisorder with a mood psychosocial stressor, the “need for permanency”.   Upon information and \nbelief, Emmanuel S. has developed an eating disorder because of the anxiety he suffers as a \nresult of his continued placement in foster care. \n166.  Plaintiff Matthew V. has also suffered emotional harm because of his continued \nplacement in ACS custody.  In March 2012, a counselor at the school he attended reported that \nMatthew V. presented concerning behavior impacting his ability to cooperate with his teacher \nand complete his work, including being readily persuaded to engage in inappropriate behavior by \nhis peers, such as going through his teacher’s belongings and engaging in physical fights.  The \nsame counselor reported that he shared that “he is both angry and sad about the current \nrelationship situation with his mother”.  In May 2014, Matthew V. was diagnosed with anxiety \nwith “lack of permanency” as a stressor.  In March 2015, Matthew V. was diagnosed with \nadjustment disorder with depressed mood with a mood psychosocial stressor, the “need for \npermanency”. \n167.  ACS has failed to ensure that Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. are \nprovided with the necessary and appropriate services to ensure their physical, psychological and \nemotional well-being.  Upon information and belief, Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. have had at \nleast five caseworkers since they were placed in ACS custody four years ago, one of whom was \ntheir caseworker for only two weeks.  Although Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. struggle in school \nand their foster mother requested additional education support for them, the Contract Agency did \nnot approve an IEP evaluation, attend any of the IEP meetings or provide them with other \neducational support until an advocate intervened on their behalf.   \n53 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5577  ooff  112299\n168.  In addition to keeping Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. free from \nemotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps \nconsistent with reasonable professional standards to place Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. in a \npermanent home.   \n169.  On April 16, 2013, the Contract Agency informed Emmanuel S. and Matthew \nV.’s therapists and their biological mother’s therapist that it planned to request Emmanuel S. and \nMatthew V.’s goal be changed to adoption.  On April 17, 2013, the Contract Agency conducted a \n“goal change conference” and decided to postpone changing the children’s goal to adoption until \nthe Contract Agency provided services to Emmanuel S. and Matthew V.’s biological mother that \nit had failed to provide.  On August 21, 2013, the Contract Agency conducted a “goal change \nconference” and filed a TPR petition in Family Court.  On August 27, 2013, nearly two years \nafter entering care, the Contract Agency spoke to Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. about being \nadopted by their current foster parent.  Upon information and belief, Emmanuel S. and Matthew \nV. have not yet been freed for adoption.  Upon information and belief, the trial in Family Court \nregarding the TPR petition is scheduled to begin in March 2016.   \n170.  During the four years that Plaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. have been in \nthe custody of ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated their constitutional, statutory and \ncontractual rights by failing to protect them from psychological and emotional harm; by failing \nto provide services to ensure them physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing \nto ensure the provision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional \nstandards or of a meaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable them to be safely returned to \ntheir biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place \nthem in a permanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful \n54 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5588  ooff  112299\noversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, these children.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and \ninactions, Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm \nand continue to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a consequence of children \nbeing harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where they will grow up and of believing that \nthere is no family they can call their own.  Because of Defendants’ actions and inactions, \nPlaintiffs Emmanuel S. and Matthew V. are being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood \nthat is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment.  \n*** \n171.  All of Defendants’ actions and inactions as described herein substantially depart \nfrom accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of \nharms and violations of legal rights suffered by the Named Plaintiff Children. \nII.  The Public Advocate for the City of New York \n172.  Plaintiff Letitia James is the Public Advocate for the City of New York (the \n“Public Advocate”).  In this capacity, the Public Advocate ensures that the city government \nserves its citizens by exercising oversight of city agencies, investigating citizen complaints \nregarding city services, and making proposals or seeking relief to address perceived \nshortcomings or failures.  \n173.  Just two months into her tenure, the Public Advocate introduced a law, Int. 0104-\n2014, that would require ACS to report information related to youth in the foster care system on \nan annual basis.  This law ensures that the City monitors which supports and resources these \nyoung adults use and identifies ongoing educational barriers they experience and problems they \n55 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  5599  ooff  112299\nmight encounter with homelessness or law enforcement.  In September 2014, the Office of the \nPublic Advocate issued a policy report concerning youth “aging out” of the foster care system.  \nThe report provided recommendations to improve data collection, access to housing, and \ncoordination of services for young people aging out of the system.  On September 30, 2014, Int. \n0104-2014 was signed into law. \n174.  On an ongoing basis, the Office of the Public Advocate Constituent Affairs \nDepartment (“the Constituent Affairs Department”) receives complaints from constituents in all \nfive boroughs alleging deficiencies and lapses in responsibilities by both ACS and Contract \nAgencies.  Constituent complaints alleged, for instance, failure to investigate allegations of abuse \nof children in ACS custody, failure to initiate timely TPR proceedings, failure to follow proper \nprocedures when removing children from their family home or foster home, failure to provide \nrequired services for both biological parents and foster children, failure to honor ACS vouchers \nand potentially retaliatory practices against those who complained directly to ACS or Contract \nAgencies.  In total, the Constituent Affairs Department has received 559 complaints regarding \nACS since January 1, 2014.  \n175.  As a result of ongoing complaints, the Public Advocate identified ACS as an \nagency whose practices warrant investigation.  \n176.  Upon learning that New York City keeps children in foster care longer than \nalmost every jurisdiction in the country, the Office of the Public Advocate began to examine \nobstacles to permanency and established a hotline to hear directly from foster children and their \nadvocates about their experiences. \n177.  In November 2014, the Office of the Public Advocate requested a copy of all \ncontracts ACS holds with individual Contract Agencies; on November 17, 2014, ACS responded \n56 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6600  ooff  112299\nwith electronic copies of all the contracts it has with the 29 Contract Agencies.  On or about \nFebruary 6, 2015, the Office requested all data collected by ACS used to produce “Scorecard” \nevaluations (see infra ¶¶ 272–75) of the Contract Agencies from 2012 to 2014, in addition to the \nScorecard evaluations themselves and any related documentation.  After receiving no response, \nthe Office of the Public Advocate repeated the request on February 27, 2015.  A meeting was \nheld on March 11, 2015, at which the document request was made for a third time and denied by \nACS.  \n178.  On or about April 1, 2015, the Office of the Public Advocate sent a letter to ACS \nthreatening legal action if they did not comply with the data request and also requested access to \nACS’s Legal Tracking System in order to investigate constituent complaints concerning \nsignificant delays and inefficiencies occurring in Family Court proceedings in which ACS is \ninvolved.  Following this correspondence, ACS provided Scorecard evaluations, but did not \nprovide the underlying data used to produce them, or the other requested information.   \n179.  Also in April 2015, the Office of the Public Advocate launched a multilingual \nhotline to learn first-hand from children and their advocates about the current barriers to \nreceiving better services while in foster care and obtaining a safe and permanent home.  \nParticipants in the hotline were asked to complete a survey.  The survey’s questions varied based \non the type of respondent—typically a child, birth parent or foster parent—and asked about the \nchild’s trajectory in foster care, permanency planning, services provided and cases of \nmaltreatment in care.  \n180.  Combining anecdotal reports from the hotline and publicly available data, the \nOffice of the Public Advocate identified several deficiencies including, but not limited to, ACS \nremoval of children without proper court process, failure to identify and provide adequate \n57 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6611  ooff  112299\nservices for parents of children in care and subsequent delays in reunification, failure to place \nchildren appropriately and thus creating instability, failure of ACS and the Contract Agencies to \nbe prepared for court dates, failure of ACS to recruit, train and support adoptive placements, \nfailure to engage in concurrent planning, failure to protect children from maltreatment and failure \nto provide adequate health and mental health services to children in care.  Those deficiencies and \nrecommendations for addressing them were cited in a report that was issued on July 2, 2015. \nIII.  Defendants \n181.  Defendant City of New York (“City”) was, and is, a municipal entity created and \nauthorized under the laws of the State of New York.  It is authorized by law to maintain and \nultimately is responsible for the New York City Administration for Children’s Services, which \nacts as its agent in the area of protecting the safety and welfare of children in the City.  The City \nassumes the risks incidental to the maintenance of the New York City Administration for \nChildren’s Services and its employment of attorneys, caseworkers and others. \n182.  Defendant New York City Administration for Children’s Services (“ACS”) was, \nand is, a municipal agency of the City responsible for protecting the safety and welfare of all \nchildren in New York City.  At all times relevant hereto, the officials, agents and employees of \nACS were acting under the color of state law in the course and scope of their duties and \nfunctions as agents, servants, employees and officials of ACS and otherwise performed and \nengaged in conduct incidental to the performance of their lawful duties.  The officials, agents and \nemployees were acting for, and on behalf of, ACS at all times relevant herein with the power and \nauthority vested in them as agents and employees of ACS and the City and incidental to their \nlawful pursuit of their duties as officials, employees and agents of ACS. \n58 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6622  ooff  112299\n183.  Defendant Gladys Carrión is Commissioner of ACS and is sued solely in her \nofficial capacity.  She is responsible for ACS’s policies, practices and operations, and for \nensuring that ACS and the private agencies with which it contracts comply with all applicable \nfederal and state laws, pursuant to the Charter of the City of New York, Chapter 24-B §§ 615 and \n617.  All children in foster care in New York City are in the custody of Defendant Carrión, and \nshe is responsible for ensuring their health, safety and well-being, including, but not limited to, \ntheir freedom from maltreatment while in state custody and their placement in a permanent home \nwithin a reasonable period of time. \n184.  Defendant State of New York (“State”) was, and is, a governmental entity.  It is \nauthorized by law to maintain and is ultimately responsible for the New York State Office of \nChildren and Family Services, which acts as its agent in the area of foster care, adoption and \nadoption assistance for children in New York State.  The State assumes the risks incidental to the \nmaintenance of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. \n185.  Defendant New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) \nwas, and is, an agency of the State responsible for programs involving foster care, adoption and \nadoption assistance for children in New York State.  At all times relevant hereto, the officials, \nagents and employees of OCFS were acting under the color of state law in the course and scope \nof their duties and functions as agents, servants, employees and officials of OCFS and otherwise \nperformed and engaged in conduct incidental to the performance of their lawful duties.  The \nofficials, agents and employees were acting for, and on behalf of, OCFS at all times relevant \nherein with the power and authority vested in them as agents and employees of OCFS and the \nState and incidental to their lawful pursuit of their duties as officials, employees and agents of \nOCFS. \n59 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6633  ooff  112299\n186.  Defendant Sheila J. Poole is Acting Commissioner of OCFS and is sued solely in \nher official capacity.  She is responsible for the policies, practices and operation of OCFS, for \nensuring OCFS’s compliance with all applicable federal and state law, pursuant to New York \nState Social Services Law §§ 11 and 17, and for providing oversight to all social services \ndistricts in the state.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n187.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343(a).  The Court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims based \non New York law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  \n188.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2002 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n189.  Venue in this district is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because the claims \narise in this district.  Although OCFS and ACS are responsible for children from all five \nboroughs of New York City, including those in the Eastern District of New York, the \nCommissioner of ACS has custody of all Plaintiff Children, and ACS’s administrative and \nmanagerial functions are operated out of its headquarters, which is located in the Southern \nDistrict of New York. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n190.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n60 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6644  ooff  112299\n191.  The general class is defined as all children who are now or will be in the foster \ncare custody of the Commissioner of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services \n(“Plaintiff Children” or the “Class”). \n192.  The Class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable.  As of \nSeptember 2015, there were approximately 10,313 children in the foster care custody of the \nCommissioner of ACS. \n193.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiff Children’s claims are \ncommon to and typical of those of each putative member of the Class whom they seek to \nrepresent.  The Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children rely on Defendants for foster \ncare services in New York City and wholly depend on the State and City Defendants for \nprovision of those services.  Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions substantially depart from accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate \nindifference to the harm, risk of harm and violations of legal rights suffered by the Named \nPlaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children. \n194.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \na.  whether State and City Defendants fail to protect Plaintiff Children from \nphysical, psychological and emotional harm;  \nb.  whether State and City Defendants fail to ensure meaningful case plans to \nenable Plaintiff Children to be safely returned to their parents or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place them in \npermanent homes;  \nc.  whether State and City Defendants fail to provide foster care placements \nand services that ensure Plaintiff Children’s well-being; and \n61 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6655  ooff  112299\nd.  whether ACS fails to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children. \n195.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \na.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s substantive rights under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; \nb.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s right to a permanent home and family \nunder the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; \nc.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s rights under the Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997; \nd.  whether City Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s rights under New York State Social \nServices Law and regulations adopted pursuant thereto; and \ne.  whether City Defendants’ actions and inactions violate Plaintiff Children’s \nrights as third party beneficiaries to the contracts between the City \nDefendants and the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the \nday-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children.  \n62 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6666  ooff  112299\n196.  The violations of law and resulting harms averred by Named Plaintiffs are typical \nof the legal violations and harms and/or risk of harms experienced by all Plaintiff Children in the \nClass. \n197.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class that \nthey seek to represent.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to \nall members of the Class, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief.  Counsel for \nPlaintiff Children know of no conflict among the Class members. \n198.  Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children are represented by the following attorneys \nwho are competent and experienced in class action litigation, child welfare litigation and \ncomplex civil litigation: \na.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, an attorney with A Better Childhood, Inc., a \nnon-profit legal advocacy organization, who has substantial experience \nand expertise in federal child welfare class actions nationally; and \nb.  Attorneys from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, including Julie A. North \nand J. Wesley Earnhardt, Members of the Firm, who have significant \nexperience in complex litigation in state and federal courts throughout the \nUnited States. \nPlaintiff Children’s attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all claims in this action \nand have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class through trial and any appeals.  \nEach Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c), \nand each next friend is sufficiently familiar with the facts of the child’s situation and dedicated to \nthe child’s best interests to fairly and adequately represent the child’s best interests in this \nlitigation. \n63 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  6677  ooff  112299\nSTRUCTURE OF THE NEW YORK CITY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n199.  Children in foster care in New York City are in the legal custody of the \nCommissioner of ACS (currently, Defendant Carrión) (“ACS custody”).  At all times, ACS \nmaintains legal custody and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City. \n200.  Pursuant to its Charter, the City of New York and Defendant Carrión, as \nCommissioner of ACS, are responsible for ensuring that ACS complies with federal and state \nlaw. \n201.  New York State provides funding to New York City that is spent on child welfare \nservices, and, through OCFS, is responsible for overseeing ACS and ensuring that ACS complies \nwith all applicable federal and state laws.  OCFS is also responsible for ensuring that ACS \ncomplies with all elements of the state plans (which OCFS signs as a condition of receiving child \nwelfare funds from the United States Department of Health and Human Services) that document \nhow the state will comply with certain core policies and procedures intended to, among other \nthings, either enable children in foster care to be reunited with their families and/or ensure timely \nefforts to find a permanent home for children who cannot be reunited with their families.  \n202.  Pursuant to the Constitution and federal and state statutory law, ACS, as the \ncustodian of children in foster care in New York City, is required to: \na.

Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 18, § 421.8. \n203.  By contract, ACS has delegated the care of the City’s children in foster care to \nagencies (“Contract Agencies”).  ACS currently has entered into valid and enforceable contracts \nwith 29 Contract Agencies.  The contracts into which ACS has entered with each of the Contract \nAgencies (referred to herein as the “Agreements”) require the Contract Agencies to comply with \n67 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7711  ooff  112299\nall applicable ACS policies, as well as state and federal law.  The Agreements also require the \nContract Agencies to provide comprehensive foster care services as defined in the Agreements.1   \n204.  Regardless of the terms of the Agreements, by law, ACS at all times maintains \nlegal custody of and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City.  \nHowever, ACS has failed and continues to fail to ensure the protection of Plaintiff Children’s \nrights under federal and state constitutional and statutory law.   \n205.  Children in New York City enter foster care in one of two ways—they can be \nvoluntarily placed into foster care by their parents,2 or they can be removed from their parents by \nACS.  Most children in foster care in New York City have been removed from their parents.  \nWhen children are removed from their parents, the removal is either (a) pursuant to a Family \nCourt finding that the child is in danger of abuse or neglect if left with his or her parents or \n(b) on an emergency basis, subject to a later finding by the Family Court that the child would \nhave been in danger of abuse or neglect if he or she had been left with his or her legal parents.  In \nboth cases, the Family Court must hold a fact-finding hearing to determine whether the child was \nin danger of being abused or neglected if left with his or her parents.  After the fact-finding \nhearing, the Family Court holds a disposition hearing to determine whether the child can safely \nbe returned home or should remain in foster care pending the completion of certain actions (e.g., \ntreatment for drug or alcohol addiction, anger management classes, etc.).   \n                                                 \n1 Each Agreement between the Contract Agency and ACS is for a particular set of foster placement services.  \nTherefore, one Contract Agency may have multiple Agreements with ACS, each for a different type of placement.  \nAppendix A lists, to the best of our information and belief, the Agreements which were current as of November \n2014 (see ¶ 177) and that are still in force today.   \n2 Unless otherwise specified, the term “parents” as used herein refers to the person(s) who have legal custody \nor legal responsibility for the child prior to his or her entry into foster care, and may include biological parents, \ngrandparents, adoptive parents or other legal guardians.  \n68 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7722  ooff  112299\n206.  Once a child enters foster care, ACS “places” the child with a Contract Agency, to \nwhich ACS delegates the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, the child.  \nUpon information and belief, placement with a Contract Agency is determined largely by which \nContract Agency has availability when placement is sought, not by a determination of the child’s \nhealth, safety or permanency needs, or of the ability of a potential available placement to meet \nthose needs.   \n207.  The Contract Agency with which the child has been placed then assigns the child \na foster placement, which can be either a traditional home-like setting or residential facility.3  \nUpon information and belief, foster placements are determined largely by availability at the time \nthe placement is sought, not by a determination of the child’s health, safety or permanency \nneeds, or of the ability of a potential available placement to meet those needs.   \n208.  Once a child is placed with a Contract Agency, caseworkers employed by that \nContract Agency are responsible for generating and recommending a case plan for the child.   \n209.  Pursuant to federal and state law, ACS is required to ensure that a case plan \nmeeting statutory criteria and professional standards is prepared for each child in foster care.  In \nNew York, these case plans are referred to as Family Assessment and Service Plans (“FASP”).  \nEach child’s FASP must describe, among other things, the child’s physical and mental health \nneeds, the child’s permanency goal, the services necessary to meet the child’s physical and \nmental needs as identified in the case plan and the services necessary to help the child achieve \nhis or her permanency goal as identified in the case plan.   \n                                                 \n3 Residential facilities include boarding homes, group homes, group residences, and institutions or residential \ntreatment facilities.  Residential facilities are the most restrictive settings, usually intended for the placement of \nolder children with severe clinical, medical, mental and/or behavioral problems.   \n69 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7733  ooff  112299\n210.  Pursuant to state and federal law, ACS also is responsible for ensuring that each \nchild’s case plan is implemented, and for providing each child in its custody with the services \nnecessary to meet the child’s physical and mental needs as identified in the case plan and the \nservices necessary to help the child achieve his or her permanency goal as identified in the case \nplan.   \n211.  ACS delegates the preparation of such case plans and the provision of such \nservices to the Contract Agency with which the child has been placed.  However, ACS fails to \nensure that the Contract Agencies prepare meaningful and appropriate FASPs for each child in \nACS custody, as required by state law.  ACS also fails to ensure that the Contract Agencies \nprovide the services necessary to meet both the child’s physical and mental needs and to help the \nchild achieve his or her permanency goal (as identified in the case plan), as required by law. \n212.  Foster care is intended to be temporary—a short-term placement until a child can \nbe safely reunified with his or her parents or, where that is not possible, placed into another \nstable, permanent home.   \n213.  Accordingly, federal and state law require ACS to ensure that each child in foster \ncare has a “permanency goal” and that reasonable efforts are made to reach each child’s \nestablished permanency goal within a reasonable period of time.  There are five possible \npermanency goals:  (1) return to parent; (2) adoption; (3) legal guardianship or kinship \nguardianship; (4) placement with a relative; and (5) another planned permanent living \narrangement (“APPLA”), the permanency goal given to children who will “age out” of the foster \ncare system.   \n214.  ACS delegates case planning responsibility, including assigning permanency \ngoals and making reasonable efforts toward permanency goals, to the Contract Agency with \n70 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7744  ooff  112299\nwhich each child in ACS custody has been placed.  However, ACS fails to ensure that the \nContract Agencies engage in meaningful and appropriate permanency planning, as required by \nfederal and state law. \n215.  Federal law requires ACS to ensure that caseworkers engage in concurrent \nplanning, so that each child in ACS custody has a primary permanency goal and a secondary \npermanency goal, both of which the caseworker must work toward simultaneously.  For \nexample, if a child’s primary permanency goal is “return to parent” and the secondary \npermanency goal is “adoption”, concurrent planning requires simultaneous provision of \nnecessary services so that the child can be returned home safely and recruitment of potential \nadoptive parents in the event the child is unable to be returned home safely.  The purpose of \nconcurrent planning is to limit the harm caused to the child by a lengthy stay in foster care by \nensuring that the child is placed into a permanent home within a reasonable period of time.   \n216.  ACS delegates case planning responsibility, including engaging in concurrent \nplanning, to the Contract Agency with which each child in ACS custody has been placed.  \nHowever, ACS fails to ensure that the Contract Agencies engage in meaningful and appropriate \nconcurrent planning, as required by federal law. \n217.  Federal and state law require ACS to ensure that a child’s case plan is periodically \nreviewed to ensure that the child’s permanency goal is appropriate and that progress is being \nmade toward safely returning the child to his or her parent or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, placing the child in a permanent home.  By state statute, an initial \nFASP review must be held between 60 and 90 days after the child is placed in foster care, and \nsubsequent FASP reviews must be held no less than every six months thereafter.  ACS must \nensure that the caseworker and all relevant persons, including, but not limited to, the parents of \n71 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7755  ooff  112299\nthe child, relatives, the foster parent and the child, if old enough, participate in the FASP \nreviews.  However, ACS fails to ensure that meaningful and appropriate FASP reviews occur as \nrequired by state law. \n218.  By state statute, a permanency hearing must be held in the Family Court within \neight months of a child’s removal from his or her parents and every six months thereafter, and \nthat permanency hearing must be completed within 30 days.  The purpose of permanency \nhearings is to provide each child in ACS custody with timely judicial review of the child’s \npermanency goal and whether progress has been made toward achieving that goal.   \n219.  Because ACS fails to ensure that all parties are prepared for court and that \nContract Agencies submit necessary paperwork in a timely fashion, such permanency hearings \noften are not completed within the time period required by state law.  In many if not most \ninstances, the permanency hearings are held before the Family Court has even made a \ndetermination about whether the parent from whom the child was removed has in fact neglected \nor abused the child. \n220.  Federal and state law provide that ACS must, after a child is removed from his or \nher parents, make a reasonable effort to preserve family relationships, which includes providing \nservices to the child’s parents.  Federal law and policy dictate that the preferred course of action \nis to reunify the child with his or her parents.   \n221.  ACS has delegated its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to reunify each \nchild in its custody with his or her parents to the Contract Agency with which the child has been \nplaced.  However, ACS fails to ensure that reasonable efforts are being made or that necessary \nservices are being provided to enable children in ACS custody to be returned home within a \nreasonable period of time, as required by federal and state law. \n72 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7766  ooff  112299\n222.  Even while efforts are being made to reunify a child with his or her parents, \nfederal law and professional standards also require ACS to ensure that concurrent planning—i.e., \nto pursue another permanency option for the child in the event that the child cannot safely be \nreturned to his or her parents (see supra ¶ 215)—occurs.  That means that ACS should not wait \nmonths or years until reunification efforts have failed to begin alternative permanency planning, \nincluding identifying other potential permanent homes for the child. \n223.  Federal and state law require ACS to determine within a reasonable period of time \nwhether or not a child in foster care can be safely and appropriately returned to his or her \nparents, and if not, to initiate a petition to terminate parental rights so that the child is legally \navailable to be adopted.  ACS has delegated the responsibility for making that determination to \nthe Contract Agency with which each child in ACS custody has been placed.  However, ACS \nfails to ensure that the Contract Agency makes that determination within a reasonable time, as \nrequired by federal and state law.  \n224.   Under federal and state law, ACS must file a petition to terminate parental rights \n(“TPR”) when a child has been in foster care for 15 of the previous 22 months, subject to certain \nexceptions that must be documented.  Under state law, ACS must file a TPR petition (a) within \n30 days of establishing a primary permanency goal of “adoption”; (b) within 60 days of \ncompleting a FASP that documents abandonment or permanent neglect of a child; and (c) within \n60 days of a judicial determination that a child was abandoned.  ACS has delegated its \nresponsibility to file TPR petitions to the Contract Agency with which each child in its custody \nhas been placed.  However, ACS fails to ensure that TPR petitions are filed within the time \nperiods required by federal and state law.  \n73 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7777  ooff  112299\n225.  Once parental rights have been terminated and a child in ACS custody is \nconsidered “freed” for adoption, state statutory law and regulations require ACS to take a \nnumber of additional steps to place that child into a permanent home, including (a) timely acting \non applications by persons looking to adopt children; (b) initiating and completing adoption \nstudies (evaluations of an applicant’s ability to be an adoptive parent) within certain time \nperiods; (c) placing children in adoptive homes within certain time periods; and (d) finalizing \nadoptions within certain time periods.  However, as the concept of concurrent planning (see \nsupra ¶ 215) makes clear, ACS should have been identifying other potential permanent homes \nfor the child well before the child is freed for adoption.  ACS has delegated these responsibilities \nto the Contract Agency with which each child in its custody has been placed; however, ACS fails \nto ensure that the necessary and appropriate steps are taken to develop an appropriate pool of \nadoptive families and to place children who have been freed for adoption into adoptive homes, as \nrequired by state law.  \n226.  Although ACS has delegated the provision of comprehensive foster care services \nin New York City to 29 Contract Agencies, that delegation does not and cannot supplant ACS’s \nresponsibilities to Plaintiff Children under federal and state law.  ACS has legal custody of all \nchildren in foster care in New York City.  ACS accordingly has legal responsibility for ensuring \nthat the rights of all children in foster care in New York City are protected—which ACS has \nfailed, and continues to fail, to do. \n74 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7788  ooff  112299\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES  \nPLAGUING NEW YORK CITY’S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND  \nRESULTING HARM TO PLAINTIFF CHILDREN \n227.  The experiences and current situations of the Named Plaintiff Children as \ndescribed above are neither unusual nor aberrational.  Rather, they are merely examples that are \nfar too typical of the irreparable harm being suffered by all children in ACS custody.   \n228.  Defendants are harming Plaintiff Children by: \na.  failing to protect Plaintiff Children from physical, psychological and \nemotional harm;  \nb.  failing to ensure the development and implementation of meaningful case \nplans to enable Plaintiff Children to be safely returned to their parents or, \nif that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place them \nin permanent homes; and  \nc.  failing to provide foster care placements and services to ensure Plaintiff \nChildren’s well-being. \n229.  These harms are a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well \ndocumented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic \ndeficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years: \na.  ACS fails to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract \nAgencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children. \n75 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  7799  ooff  112299\nb.  ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers are assigned \ncaseloads and receive appropriate training consistent with professional \nstandards. \nc.  ACS fails to provide a system for making foster placements consistent \nwith federal and state law and minimum professional standards. \nd.  ACS fails to ensure case and service plans are developed and implemented \nconsistent with federal and state law and minimum professional standards. \ne.  ACS fails to take all necessary and available action to ensure timely \nadjudication of family court proceedings involving children in ACS \ncustody consistent with federal and state law and minimum professional \nstandards. \nAll of Defendants’ actions and inactions as described herein substantially depart from accepted \nprofessional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of legal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \n230.  Put simply, as a result of Defendants’ failures, caseworkers employed by the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the care of Plaintiff Children often are \ninexperienced, undertrained, under-supervised, overworked and underpaid; case planning often is \nsloppy and ineffective; there are not enough suitable and appropriate foster and pre-adoptive \nplacements to meet Plaintiff Children’s needs; and a lack of urgency and accountability pervades \nNew York City’s foster care system.   \n231.  Defendants have long been aware of these systemic failures and the resulting \nharm to the vulnerable children in ACS custody.  Since 2000, OCFS has undergone two federal \nperformance audits of the New York State child welfare system, known as Child and Family \n76 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8800  ooff  112299\nServices Reviews (“CFSR”).  These reviews are conducted by the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services to assess the performance of child welfare systems across the \ncountry, including the outcomes achieved for children, to identify areas in which systemic \nimprovement is required to assure appropriate outcomes for children, and to implement \ncorrective actions where outcomes for children are found to be deficient.  States are evaluated on \nseven outcome indicators of safety, permanency and well-being—the unequivocal goals of all \nfoster care systems pursuant to federal statutory law—and on seven systemic factors that affect \nthe state’s capacity to deliver foster care services effectively.  \n232.  The two federal audits completed to date revealed myriad areas in which the New \nYork State foster care system was causing harm to the children in its care, and that New York \nState’s foster care system was getting worse.  The first CFSR audit, which was published in \n2002, found that New York State failed to conform to federal expectations in five of the seven \nsafety, permanency and well-being indicators, and in three of the seven systemic factors.  Seven \nyears later, New York State performed worse.  During the second CFSR audit, which was \npublished in 2009, the federal government determined that New York State failed to conform to \nfederal expectations in all seven safety, permanency and well-being indicators, and in five of the \nseven systemic factors.  New York State’s CFSR results are heavily influenced by New York \nCity’s child welfare system, which accounted for well over 60% of children in foster care in New \nYork State in both 2002 and 2009. \n233.  Notwithstanding having had 13 years to improve performance since the first \nCFSR audit of New York State, Defendants continue to place New York City children in ACS \ncustody at significant risk of harm.  The most recent federal data available shows that children in \n77 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8811  ooff  112299\nNew York State spend longer in foster care and are more likely to be maltreated while in foster \ncare than children in virtually all other states.  \n234.  Defendants are not acting with sufficient urgency to address these known failures \nor to meet their legal obligations to protect the children in New York City’s foster care system.   \nI.  DEFENDANTS ARE CAUSING IRREPARABLE HARM TO CHILDREN IN ACS \nCUSTODY. \nA.  Defendants Fail To Protect Children in ACS Custody from Maltreatment.  \n235.  Maltreatment of children in foster care is a significant problem in New York City. \n236.  New York City currently accounts for almost 60% of children in foster care in \nNew York State, which lags far behind the nation with respect to the protection of children in \nfoster care.   \n237.  Based on the most recent federal data available, New York State ranks 46th out of \n48 states and territories for instances of substantiated or indicated maltreatment of children while \nin foster care.  Put simply, children in New York are more likely to be harmed while under the \nstate’s protection than children in virtually every other state.  \n238.  New York State has had a high rate of maltreatment in foster care for years.  In \nboth the 2002 and 2009 CFSRs, the federal government found that New York State did not meet \nthe national standard for the rate of maltreatment in foster care.  Based on the most recent federal \ndata available, New York State did not meet the national standard for 2013. \n239.  Upon information and belief, the high rate of maltreatment in care in New York \nState is largely driven by maltreatment of children in ACS custody in New York City, which \naccounts for the majority of children in foster care in New York State. \n240.  All investigations of maltreatment, including those pertaining to children in foster \ncare custody, begin with a call to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and \n78 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8822  ooff  112299\nMaltreatment (“SCR”).  According to ACS, in 2014, SCR received 1,987 reports of maltreatment \nof children in ACS custody (i.e., children in foster care in New York City).  ACS’s Office of \nSpecial Investigation investigates reports of maltreatment made to the SCR, including those for \nchildren already in foster care; a report of maltreatment is “substantiated” when sufficient \nevidence is found to support a determination that a child was in fact maltreated.  Of the 1,987 \nreports of maltreatment in foster care received by SCR in 2014, 28% were substantiated.  The \nChildren’s Bureau of the federal government does not publish comparable data. \n241.  The high rate of maltreatment of children in ACS custody is a direct result of \nDefendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to \nremedy structural and systemic deficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care \nsystem for years.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Plaintiff Children are protected from maltreatment \nsubstantially departs from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nB.  Defendants Fail To Provide Children in ACS Custody with Permanent Homes and \nFamilies Within a Reasonable Time.  \n242.  Foster care is intended to be temporary.  Children who do not grow up in stable \nfamily environments are less likely to complete their education, to form healthy relationships or \nto be otherwise prepared to live healthy, satisfying adult lives.  Accordingly, federal and state \nlaw and professional standards dictate that foster children should be placed in permanent homes \nas quickly as is safely possible, whether with their parents, another relative or an adoptive \nfamily. \n243.  But ACS allows Plaintiff Children to languish for years in foster care without \npermanent homes or families to call their own.  Indeed, the most recent federal data available \nshows that New York City lags far behind the rest of New York State and the nation as a whole \n79 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8833  ooff  112299\nin placing children in foster care custody in permanent homes.  As a result, children spend longer \nin foster care custody in New York City than virtually everywhere else in the nation. \n1.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Children Are Timely and Safely Reunified \nwith Their Parents. \n244.  Federal and state law provide that ACS must, in the first instance, make \nreasonable efforts to preserve a child’s relationship with his or her family.  After a child is \nremoved from home due to allegations of abuse or neglect, federal and state law and policy \ndictate that the preferred course of action is to reunify the child with his or her parents.  \nReunification, however, is only appropriate where the reason for removal has been addressed \nthrough appropriate services to the family so that the child’s safety is assured.  As a result, ACS \nmust ensure the provision of appropriate and effective services4 so that children in ACS custody \ncan safely return home.   \n245.  ACS fails to ensure that children in ACS custody are safely returned to their \nparents within a reasonable period of time.   \na.  It takes longer to return children in foster care to their parents in New \nYork City than in the rest of New York State and the rest of the nation as a \nwhole.  The most recent federal data available shows that children in New \nYork City had spent a median of over a year—12.6 months—in foster care \nbefore being reunified with their parents, while children in the rest of New \nYork State spent a median of 10.8 months, and children in the rest of the \nnation spent a median of 8.6 months in foster care prior to reunification.   \n                                                 \n4 Necessary reunification services, which should be established and set forth in the child’s case plan, may \ninclude psychological evaluations and/or care, substance abuse treatment, parenting classes or assistance, or \nassistance with accessing adequate housing. \n80 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8844  ooff  112299\nb.  New York City takes longer to return children in foster care to their \nparents than all but five other states and territories.  Based on the most \nrecent available federal data comparing the median number of days \nchildren spent in foster care prior to being returned to their parents, New \nYork City ranks 48th of 53 jurisdictions.    \n246.  ACS also fails to ensure that children are safely returned to their parents.  \nChildren who are eventually reunified with their legal parents too often re-enter foster care due \nto further abuse or neglect.  In 2014, 13.9% of foster care placements in New York City were of \nchildren who had been in foster care within the previous three years.  Failed reunifications cause \nharm to children both as a result of additional maltreatment—in the worst cases, severe injury or \neven death—and the trauma that accompanies repeated family separation. \n2.  Defendants Fail To Ensure a Timely Permanent Home for Children in \nACS Custody When Reunification Is Not Possible. \n247.  When a child cannot be returned safely to his or her parents, federal and state law \nrequire ACS to promptly find children in its custody alternative permanent homes, typically \nthrough adoption or kinship guardianship. \n248.  However, ACS fails to secure timely adoptions for too many children in its \ncustody who cannot safely be returned to their parents.  Instead, these children languish in ACS \ncustody for years without a permanent home or family to call their own. \na.  For children who cannot be safely returned to their parents, it takes longer \nto be adopted in New York City than in the rest of New York State.  It also \ntakes longer to be adopted in New York City than in every other state in \nthe nation.   \n81 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8855  ooff  112299\nb.  Children who were adopted in New York City in 2013 spent a median of \n55.8 months—over 4.5 years—in foster care prior to adoption.  In \ncontrast, children in the rest of New York State spent almost two years \nless time—a median of 32.6 months—in foster care prior to being \nadopted, and children in the rest of the nation spent less than half that \namount of time—a median of 26.9 months—in foster care prior to being \nadopted.   \nc.  Based on the most recent available federal data comparing the median \nnumber of days children spent in foster care prior to being adopted, New \nYork City ranks dead last—a fact that has been true since at least 2007.   \n249.  The City Defendants are well aware that it takes over 4.5 years for a child to be \nadopted in New York City.  The City has published that fact for the past five years in its Mayor’s \nManagement Reports. \n3.  Defendants’ Failure To Provide Children in ACS Custody Permanent \nHomes Within a Reasonable Period of Time Causes Irreparable Harm. \n250.  Research has shown that permanent homes and families are critical to ensuring a \nchild’s healthy development and continue to confer benefits that contribute to the child’s success \nthroughout life.  Being placed with a permanent family helps infants with brain development; \nyoung children with self esteem, healthy attachment and behavior regulation; and adolescents \nwith independence and healthy boundary-setting.  Parental support and a stable, familiar \nenvironment also help children cope after traumatic experiences. \n251.  Conversely, research has shown that children suffer when they grow up in state \ncustody without the protective effects of a permanent home and family.  Each year, \n82 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8866  ooff  112299\napproximately 1,000 young people “age out” of New York City’s foster care system, the vast \nmajority on their own with virtually no safety net.  These children suffer irreparable harm.  \nResearch has shown that children who “age out” of foster care are more likely than their peers to \nbe unemployed, homeless and incarcerated as adults; are more likely to have drug dependence \nand post-traumatic stress disorder; and are less likely to have graduated high school, attended \ncollege, or to have a savings or checking account. \n252.  Too frequently, caseworkers push children to accept the permanency goal of \nAPPLA—the goal given to children who will “age out” of the foster care system—at young ages, \noften failing to explore other options, such as adoption or placement with a relative.  ACS allows \ntoo many children who cannot safely be returned home to be deemed “unadoptable” without \nmaking reasonable efforts to search for or secure permanent homes for those children.  ACS also \nfails to explore alternative permanency options for older teens who may express that they do not \nwant to be adopted but who would nevertheless benefit from a permanent and stable adult \nconnection. \n253.  Defendants have long been aware of the harm children suffer when they do not \ngrow up in a permanent home or have a permanent family.  In February 2011, Defendant OCFS \nsent ACS and the Contract Agencies an informational letter stating that “children who have a \nsignificant connection to an adult generally fare better” and that “[s]tudies of youth who leave \nfoster care without a safe, permanent family reveal consistently negative life outcomes.”  \nHowever, Defendants have made no meaningful efforts to improve permanency for Plaintiff \nChildren.  \n254.  ACS’s failure to provide Plaintiff Children with permanent homes within a \nreasonable period of time is a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented \n83 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8877  ooff  112299\nactions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic deficiencies that \nhave plagued New York City’s foster care system for years.  ACS’s failure to ensure that \nPlaintiff Children are placed in permanent homes within a reasonable period of time substantially \ndeparts from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the \nrisk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nC.  Defendants Fail To Provide Foster Placements and Services that Ensure the Well-\nBeing of Children in ACS Custody. \n255.  Federal and state law and professional standards require ACS to ensure foster care \nservices are provided in a manner that ensures the well-being of each child in ACS custody. \n256.  Federal and state law and professional standards require ACS to ensure that each \nchild in ACS custody is placed in the most appropriate, least restrictive placement available.  The \nabrupt and overwhelming change of being removed from his or her parents and placed into ACS \ncustody can further traumatize a child.  In the process of initial placement, children are removed, \noften abruptly, from familiar surroundings and lose everything known and comforting.  Research \nhas shown that change of this magnitude has a detrimental effect on brain and neurological \nfunction and other negative physiological effects.5  Accordingly, foster placements should be \nbased on an assessment of the individual child’s needs and should promote stability and \ncontinuity by placing children with relatives, keeping children in their communities and schools, \nand keeping siblings together whenever possible.  \n                                                 \n5 This is one reason why children, especially very young children, often regress in their development and \nbehaviors (e.g., toilet training, talking, etc.) after being removed from their parents.  Separation from family, and the \nresulting attachment disruption, may intensify these negative physiological effects and is particularly devastating for \nyounger children. \n84 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8888  ooff  112299\n257.  Instead, ACS further harms Plaintiff Children by putting them in inappropriate \nfoster placements ill-equipped to meet their needs, which results in far too many children being \nshuffled from foster placement to foster placement: \na.  In December 2011, ACS published data stating that 14% of children then \nin ACS custody had experienced more than six transfers while in foster \ncare; an additional 16% had been shuffled from between three and five \nplacements.  \nb.  More recently, in July 2015, the Public Advocate published a report, \nfinding that 26% of the foster children surveyed had experienced five or \nmore transfers while in ACS custody. \n258.  Being shuffled from foster placement to foster placement negatively affects a \nchild’s well-being.  Children may be dropped off at a new place with no explanation for where \nthey are going and why.  This degree of turbulence can lead to emotional trauma and attachment \ndisorders, and causes children to lose all sense of stability and security.  Frequent moves may \nresult in children losing contact with siblings, other family members, friends and adults in their \ncommunity who may have been involved in their lives.   \n259.  Multiple placements can also cause educational interruptions and compromise the \nchild’s ability to finish school.  Federal statutory law and reasonable professional standards \nrequire ACS to make reasonable efforts to keep children in the same school whenever possible.   \n260.  As a result, for too many children in ACS custody, moving foster placements \nmeans changing schools, losing teachers and friends.  In 2009, Children’s Rights, a national \nadvocacy organization for abused and neglected children, ACS and the Legal Aid Society \nJuvenile Rights Practice conducted a study of children in New York City’s foster care system \n85 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  8899  ooff  112299\n(referred to herein as “The Long Road Home Study”).6   The Long Road Home Study found that \n30% of children studied had experienced at least one school transfer within the past year and that \nchildren who had experienced more than one placement move in a one-year period were \nsignificantly more likely to have experienced a school transfer as well.   \n261.  The failure to provide educational stability—like the failure to provide placement \nstability—further damages children in ACS custody.  School is often the one place where \nchildren who are being abused or neglected at home feel safe, so changing schools can be \ntraumatic.  Research has also shown that children in foster care have lower standardized test \nscores, poorer academic performance and higher rates of grade retention, absenteeism, tardiness, \ntruancy and dropout than their peers.  According to data from the New York City Department of \nEducation, foster youth in 8th grade score significantly lower than their peers in English and \nmath.   \n262.  Federal and state law also require ACS to ensure that all children in its legal \ncustody receive the necessary services to ensure their well-being.  This includes adequate \nmedical, dental and mental health assessments and follow-up care; educational assessments and \nservices; independent living services; substance abuse treatment; or family planning services, as \nneeded.   \n263.  However, ACS fails to ensure that all children in its custody are provided with \nthese essential services to ensure their well-being:   \na.  New York City fails to meet the national standard for providing adequate \nmedical, dental and mental health care.  In the 2009 CFSR, for example, \n                                                 \n6 The results of this study were published in a November 2009 report entitled “The Long Road Home:  A Study \nof Children Stranded in New York City Foster Care”. \n86 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9900  ooff  112299\nthe federal government determined that only 73% of children in New York \nCity received adequate services to meet their physical and mental health \nneeds—well below the national benchmark of 95%. \nb.  The Long Road Home Study found that ACS failed to ensure the provision \nof necessary mental health services for a substantial number of children in \nits custody—16% of children studied who needed a mental health \nassessment, 19% of children studied who needed individual therapy and \n11% of children studied who needed psychotropic medication had not \nreceived those critical mental health services within the past year.  The \nstudy also found that many children who needed the B2H Medicaid \nwaiver program did not receive it because caseworkers failed to make \ntimely referrals or because there were not enough slots in the program. \n264.  These services are critical to the well-being of children in ACS custody, who are \nparticularly vulnerable to irreparable physical, psychological and emotional damage from ACS’s \nfailure to provide necessary services.  Children in foster care custody often have experienced \nsevere and chronic trauma, including physical or sexual abuse, neglect and domestic or \ncommunity violence, as well as other stressors such as extreme poverty or parental substance \nabuse.  Research has shown that children exposed to repeated traumatic stress or pervasive \nneglect, including children removed from their home due to abuse or neglect, manifest increased \nphysical, psychological and emotional problems later in life.  Being placed in and left to languish \nin foster care without a permanent home or family further compounds these problems.   \n265.  According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, exposure to trauma \nderails development in children of all ages.  Young children (five and younger) may experience \n87 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9911  ooff  112299\nsensitivity to noise, avoidance of contact, heightened startle response, confusion about what is \ndangerous and who to go to for protection, and fear of being separated from familiar people and \nplaces.  School-aged children (ages six to 12) may exhibit emotional swings, learning problems, \nspecific anxieties and fears, attention seeking behavior and reversion to younger behaviors.  \nAdolescents (13 to 21) may have difficulty imagining or planning for the future, over- or under-\nestimate danger, display inappropriate aggression, and engage in reckless and/or self-destructive \nbehaviors. \n266.  Accordingly, it is critical that all children in ACS custody are properly assessed \nand receive necessary services as soon as possible to facilitate their recovery from the trauma \nthey already have experienced.  However, ACS fails to ensure that all children in its custody are \nprovided with these critical services within a reasonable period of time.   \n267.  ACS also fails to ensure that the quality of services being provided to Plaintiff \nChildren is consistent with professional standards.  Upon information and belief, many Contract \nAgencies do not directly provide services; instead, they refer foster children to other service \nproviders with which the City contracts.  However, upon information and belief, the City \nDefendants do not exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over these service providers.  \nUpon information and belief, most mental health services provided to children in ACS custody \nare ineffective and of poor quality, but ACS continues to renew contracts with these substandard \nservice providers while the few quality service providers have lengthy waiting lists. \n268.  ACS’s failure to provide Plaintiff Children with appropriate foster care \nplacements consistent with professional standards and services to ensure their physical, \npsychological and emotional well-being is a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well-\ndocumented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic \n88 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9922  ooff  112299\ndeficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years.  These failures \nsubstantially depart from accepted professional judgment and demonstrate a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nII.  DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO REMEDY THE SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \nPLAGUING NEW YORK CITY’S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n269.  The harms described in ¶¶ 235–68 are a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing \nand well-documented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and \nsystemic deficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years, including: \na.  the City Defendants’ failure to exercise adequate and meaningful \noversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-\nto-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children to \nensure foster care services are provided consistent with federal and state \nlaw and minimum professional standards; \nb.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers are assigned \ncaseloads and receive appropriate training consistent with professional \nstandards; \nc.  ACS’s failure to provide a system for making foster placements consistent \nwith federal and state law and minimum professional standards; \nd.  ACS’s failure to ensure case and service plans are developed and \nimplemented consistent with federal and state law and minimum \nprofessional standards; and \ne.  ACS’s failure to take all necessary and available action to ensure timely \nadjudication of family court proceedings involving children in ACS \n89 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9933  ooff  112299\ncustody consistent with federal and state law and minimum professional \nstandards. \nThese failures substantially depart from accepted professional judgment and demonstrate a \ndeliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and violations of rights suffered by Plaintiff \nChildren. \nA.  City Defendants Fail To Exercise Adequate and Meaningful Oversight over \nContract Agencies. \n270.  By contract, ACS delegates its responsibility to provide children in its custody \nwith foster care services to Contract Agencies.  However, ACS at all times maintains legal \ncustody of and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City.  ACS thus \nhas an obligation to Plaintiff Children to ensure that Contract Agencies are providing foster care \nservices consistent with all applicable law and professional standards.  ACS fails to do so. \n271.  Instead, ACS does not meaningfully supervise Contract Agencies or hold them \naccountable for underperformance.  As a result, ACS shirks its legal obligations to Plaintiff \nChildren while the City pays millions of dollars to Contract Agencies for the provision of foster \ncare services without ensuring that those services are adequately provided to Plaintiff Children.   \n272.  Under the Agreements, ACS is expressly required to supervise, monitor, audit and \nreview the activities of the Contract Agencies.  Currently, ACS conducts an annual evaluation, \ncalled “Scorecard”, of each Contract Agency to evaluate process, practice and outcome \nindicators in safety, permanency and well-being.  According to ACS’s 2014 Scorecard \nMethodology, the Scorecard evaluation involves reviewing a combination of case-specific and \naggregate data.  Each Contract Agency then receives a letter grade (from A to F) indicating its \nperformance for safety, for permanency and for well-being.   \n90 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9944  ooff  112299\n273.  The Scorecard evaluations are flawed and ineffective for at least the following \nreasons:   \na.  ACS fails to measure several key performance metrics.  For example, \nACS has failed to develop Scorecard measures to evaluate whether \nContract Agencies are successfully engaging in concurrent planning and \nwhether Contract Agencies are making efforts to recruit non-kinship foster \nparents and adoptive parents. \nb.  Upon information and belief, the results of the Scorecard evaluations do \nnot accurately reflect each Contract Agency’s performance in providing \nfoster care services to children in ACS custody.   \nc.  ACS’s performance standards are simply too low—upon information and \nbelief, the majority of Contract Agencies receive “passing” grades even \nthough New York City has one of the worst foster care systems in the \nnation. \n274.  ACS also fails to hold Contract Agencies accountable for underperformance on \nthe Scorecard evaluations.  According to ACS’s 2014 Scorecard Methodology, ACS’s Agency \nProgram Assistance team (“APA”) analyzes the Scorecard data to identify areas of strength and \nweakness for each Contract Agency and works collaboratively with each Contract Agency and \nwith ACS to improve performance.  APA sets benchmarks throughout the year for each Contract \nAgency; however these benchmarks are relative and set by taking into account the Contract \nAgency’s current performance, ACS standards and system-wide performance.   \n275.  When performance is “considerably or persistently poor”, APA can use \n“accountability mechanisms” in order to drive performance.  However, ACS does not adequately \n91 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9955  ooff  112299\nuse its accountability mechanisms to ensure appropriate performance of the Contract Agencies.  \nACS’s failure to make Scorecard data publicly available further decreases accountability. \n276.  As a direct result of ACS’s failure to meaningfully oversee the Contract Agencies, \nPlaintiff Children suffer irreparable harm because there simply are no consequences for the \nfailure to protect them from physical, psychological and emotional harm; the failure to enable \nthem to be safely returned to their parents or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to place them in permanent homes; and the failure to provide them with appropriate \nfoster placements and necessary services to ensure their well-being. \nB.  Defendants Fail To Ensure an Adequately Staffed and Appropriately Trained \nChild Welfare Workforce. \n277.  No foster care system can effectively perform its basic functions absent a well-\ntrained, experienced and adequately staffed workforce.  In New York City, ACS has delegated \nits obligation to care for the children in state custody to Contract Agencies, who in turn employ \nthe caseworkers that directly interact with children in foster care and their families.  However, \nACS fails to ensure that these caseworkers are adequately trained, supervised and staffed, \nconsistent with professional standards. \n1.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Caseworkers Are Adequately Trained and \nSupervised. \n278.  Caseworkers must be fluent in governing policy and procedure and familiar with \ncurrent best practices.  Consistent with professional standards, a foster care system should \nrequire pre-service training, which must be completed before caseworkers can carry an active \ncaseload, and mandatory annual in-service training designed to refresh caseworkers in basic \npolicy and procedure and to teach advances in policy and in the field.  In addition, it is critical to \nensure appropriate supervision. \n92 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9966  ooff  112299\n279.  ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers receive adequate training \nor supervision.  In 2009, the Long Road Home Study, which was performed in conjunction with \nACS, found that a substantial proportion of caseworkers had not received any training before \nbeing given responsibility for a caseload of foster children.  That same study also found that the \nquality of caseworker supervision at Contract Agencies was questionable.   \n2.  Caseworkers Carry Unmanageable Caseloads. \n280.  Child welfare research has shown that high caseworker caseloads negatively \nimpact children in foster care.  Caseworkers with high caseloads have less time to interact with \nchildren, families and service providers and provide meaningful and appropriate case plans, \nnecessary services, and timely casework and decision-making.  It is therefore critical that \ncaseworkers have manageable caseloads.   \n281.  However, in New York City, ACS fails to ensure that all Contract Agency \ncaseworkers carry caseloads consistent with professional standards.  \n282.  The Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a coalition of private and \npublic agencies that develops child welfare policies and promotes sound child welfare practice, \nhas established nationally recognized standards for caseworker caseloads.  The standards \ngoverning foster care caseworkers limit caseloads to between 12 and 15 children per worker.  \nThe Council on Accreditation (“COA”), an accrediting body that partners with human service \norganizations to improve child welfare service delivery outcomes, recommends that caseloads \nfor foster care caseworkers be limited to between eight and 15 children per worker, depending on \nthe needs of the children. \n283.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies comply \nwith these caseload standards, and many caseworkers’ caseloads in New York City exceed this \n93 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9977  ooff  112299\nstandard by a wide margin.  The Long Road Home Study found that caseworker caseloads \nexceed recommended sizes.  Similarly, at a briefing in January 2013, a member of ACS’s senior \nmanagement under the previous administration stated that caseloads could range from 16 to 24 \nchildren, noting that this was far too high.   \n284.  Excessive caseloads overburden caseworkers and prevent them from performing \ncasework consistent with federal and state law and professional standards. \n285.  High caseloads also contribute to burnout and turnover among caseworkers.  \nResearch has shown that Contract Agency caseworker turnover is associated with children \nexperiencing multiple placements, receiving fewer services, staying in foster care longer and \nfailing to achieve permanency.  When a case changes hands from caseworker to caseworker, \nrelationships are severed and valuable information is lost.  ACS does not publish system-wide \ndata regarding foster care caseworker turnover; upon information and belief, ACS does not \ncollect such data.  In 2006, the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies reported Contract \nAgency caseworker turnover rates of 40%.  In 2009, the Long Road Home Study reported that \ncaseworker turnover is a major barrier to permanency.  Upon information and belief, high foster \ncare caseworker turnover rates persist. \n3.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Regular Caseworker Visits to Children in \nFoster Homes or Congregate Care. \n286.  Caseworkers must have regular face-to-face contact with children in foster care, \nparents, and foster parents or child care workers.  The primary purpose of these contacts is to \nensure the safety and well-being of the children, to engage families in planning for their children, \nto assess the strengths and needs of all family members and caregivers, and to address the needs \nof all family members and caregivers in order to move children out of foster care and into \npermanent homes. \n94 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9988  ooff  112299\n287.  COA recommends that caseworkers meet separately with children, parents and \nfoster parents at least once a month.  ACS policy requires a minimum of monthly contact \nbetween caseworkers and children in foster care. \n288.  However, ACS fails to ensure that caseworkers are making sufficient contacts \nwith children, parents and foster parents to ensure the safety and well-being of children in ACS \ncustody.  The Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in conjunction with ACS in 2009, \nfound that caseworkers did not maintain adequate contact with children, parents and foster \nparents.   \n289.  Moreover, upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract \nAgencies make unannounced visits to ensure that children in ACS custody are protected from \nmaltreatment.  Upon information and belief, ACS also fails to ensure that visits with children \ntake place privately and out of the presence of the child’s caretaker. \n290.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers maintain contact with \nkey persons to ensure the safety and well-being of children in its care substantially departs from \nreasonable professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm \nto Plaintiff Children. \n291.  As a direct result of ACS’s failure to ensure that caseworkers maintain regular \ncontact with children, parents and foster parents, Plaintiff Children frequently suffer harm \nbecause their assigned caseworkers are unable to meaningfully assess the child’s safety and well-\nbeing and to provide necessary services to place the child into a permanent home.  ACS’s failure \nto ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers make sufficient contacts with the children in ACS \ncustody substantially departs from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \n95 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  9999  ooff  112299\n*** \n292.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that the first point of contact for \nall Plaintiff Children—the Contract Agency caseworkers—are trained, supervised, staffed and \nperforming visits consistent with professional standards, Plaintiff Children frequently suffer \nharm because their assigned caseworkers are ill-prepared to make the judgments necessary to \npromote their safety, permanency and well-being, unable to meaningfully address their complex \nand varied needs and unable to meaningfully assess the child’s safety and well-being or provide \nnecessary services.  ACS’s failures as described above substantially depart from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of legal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \nC.  Defendants’ Processes for Making Foster Placements in New York City Are \nDeficient. \n293.  When ACS removes a child from his or her parents, ACS is obligated to provide a \nsafe temporary home for that child until he or she is discharged from foster care.  Federal and \nstate law require ACS to ensure that each child in ACS custody is placed in the most appropriate, \nleast restrictive placement available.  Professional standards dictate that foster placements be \nbased on an assessment of the individual child’s needs and promote stability and continuity by \nplacing children with relatives, keeping children in their communities and schools, and keeping \nsiblings together whenever possible.   \n294.  In order to meet the needs of a large and diverse foster care population, ACS must \nensure the recruitment and maintenance of a sufficient number of homes to accommodate the \nnumber of children currently in custody and additional children as they enter the system on an \nongoing basis.  In addition, a sufficient array of placement types must be available to meet \nchildren’s needs.  The types of placements will range from “basic” foster homes that provide \n96 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110000  ooff  112299\nordinary parental care to children without heightened therapeutic needs, to more “therapeutic”, \n“intensive” or “specialized” foster homes that receive additional training and support for the care \nof more high-needs children, to more highly structured or “restrictive” group homes and \nresidential programs suitable for children who cannot yet thrive in a family setting.  In addition, \nplacements may vary in terms of their likelihood to develop into permanent or adoptive homes if \nthe child cannot safely be returned to his parents.   \n295.  Placement in a stable and appropriate foster home can be critical to a child’s \nchances of securing a permanent home because a child who cannot safely be returned to his \nparent is most likely to be adopted by kin or a foster parent.   \n296.  However, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies recruit and retain an \nadequate number and variety of placements to meet Plaintiff Children’s needs.  In particular, \nACS fails to ensure that a sufficient number of pre-adoptive homes are recruited and retained, \nparticularly for children who cannot safely be returned to their parents but who are “hard to \nplace” into adoptive homes, such as adolescents, children with health or behavioral problems and \nlarge sibling groups.   \n297.  Pursuant to the Agreements, the City pays each Contract Agency per diem \npayments for every day a child is in foster care, thus incentivizing Contract Agencies to keep \nchildren in care longer.  As a result, Contract Agencies may not pursue adoptive resources with \nurgency or offer sufficient resources for persons who are interested in adopting foster children.  \nUpon information and belief, Contract Agencies often tell individuals interested in adoption that \nthey are “in the business of fostering, not adoption”—even though ACS has delegated to them \nboth the care of children who safely can be returned to their parents and the care of children in \nneed of adoption and waiting desperately for a permanent home and family to call their own.   \n97 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110011  ooff  112299\n298.  The City and State Defendants have long been aware of, and have failed to fix, \nthis systemic failure.  Indeed, Defendant Carrión recently admitted that ACS “really need[s] to \ndo a better job of publicizing . . . we need to do more to get the message out that these children \nare waiting and that they need adoptive homes.”  However, the City Defendants have recently \ntaken actions that will make these problems worse—by defunding the only two voluntary service \nproviders whose sole mission was to find adoptive homes for older and “hard to place” children \nin foster care.  During a March 2015 City Council meeting, Commissioner Carrión stated that the \ndefunding of these two agencies “wasn’t a great loss”.   \n299.  ACS also lacks an effective system for appropriately matching Plaintiff Children \nwith the most appropriate foster placement to meet their needs.  Upon information and belief, \nACS does not assess a child’s safety, health or permanency needs prior to placing the child with \na Contract Agency.  Instead, ACS makes a blind placement decision based on which Contract \nAgency has availability at the time the placement is sought.  Upon information and belief, the \nContract Agency does not assess a child’s safety, health or permanency needs prior to placing the \nchild into a foster placement.  Instead, the Contract Agency makes the determination based on \nwhich foster placement has availability at the time the placement is sought. \n300.  Put simply, ACS fails to ensure that the children in its custody who cannot, or \nwho are least likely to, return home safely are placed in pre-adoptive foster placements that are \nmore likely to turn into permanent adoptive homes.  Instead, ACS places the child with whatever \nContract Agency has availability at the time the placement is sought. \n301.  Moreover, ACS also fails to ensure that children who are unlikely to be safely \nreturned to their parents and who will not be adopted by kin or their current foster parent are \nquickly placed with Contract Agencies capable of individually recruiting adoptive parents.   \n98 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110022  ooff  112299\n302.  As a direct result of these failures, Plaintiff Children frequently are harmed \nbecause they are not placed in the best foster home to meet their safety and permanency needs.  \nACS’s failure to recruit and retain a sufficient number of foster homes and to match children in \nits custody with foster placements that meet their needs substantially departs from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \nD.  ACS Fails To Ensure that Meaningful Case Plans and Service Plans for Foster \nChildren Are Developed and Implemented.  \n303.  Federal and state law require caseworkers to establish a permanency goal and to \ndevelop a strategic plan for achieving that goal.  This includes establishing a permanency goal, \nengaging in concurrent planning, developing and implementing service plans to promote \nreunification, and recruiting and securing an alternative permanent home for children who cannot \nbe safely returned home. \n304.  According to OCFS’s own standards, caseworkers in New York State should \nestablish a child’s permanency goal within 30 days of the child entering the foster care system.  \nHowever, by OCFS’s own measure, nearly one-third of children entering foster care for the first \ntime do not have a documented permanency goal within 90 days of admission.  \n305.  Federal and state law and policy require caseworkers in New York City to \nconduct concurrent permanency planning as soon as a child is taken into foster care, so that there \nis a primary permanency plan and a secondary permanency plan that caseworkers pursue \nsimultaneously.  ACS fails to ensure that concurrent planning occurs.  Upon information and \nbelief, caseworkers do not begin to engage in non-reunification permanency planning until long \nafter it becomes clear that the child’s parents will not be able to safely care for the child. \n99 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110033  ooff  112299\n306.  As a direct result of these systemic deficiencies, New York City’s foster children \nstay in the system for far too long.  This is no secret to ACS.  ACS has been aware of rampant \ncase planning deficiencies in New York City for years.   \na.  In the 2002 and 2009 CFSRs, the federal government concluded that \nappropriate permanency goals were not established in a timely manner for \nchildren in foster care in New York State.   \nb.  Similarly, the Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in conjunction \nwith ACS in 2009, found that children in ACS custody spent a long time \nin foster care before their permanency goal was changed to adoption, \nalternative permanency options were not adequately explored and \nconcurrent planning was not sufficiently documented.   \n307.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failures (as described in this section) to ensure \nthe provision of meaningful and appropriate case plans, Plaintiff Children frequently grow up in \nACS custody without a permanent home or family to call their own.  ACS’s failure to ensure that \nmeaningful and appropriate case planning occurs substantially departs from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of harms, \nand violations of legal rights being suffered by Plaintiff Children. \n1.  ACS Fails To Ensure Services Are Provided To Sustain Family Ties and \nSupport Reunification When It Is Safely Possible. \n308.  After a child is removed from home due to abuse or neglect, federal and state law \nand policy dictate that the preferred course of action is to reunify the child with his or her \nparents.  Reunification, however, is only appropriate where the reason for removal has been \naddressed through appropriate services to the family so that the child’s safety is assured.  \n100 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110044  ooff  112299\nHowever, ACS fails to ensure the provision of meaningful case planning and effective services \nto support reunification: \na.  ACS often fails to ensure that Contract Agencies involve parents in case \nplanning and service planning for their children.  In the 2009 CFSR, the \nfederal government found that ACS had adequately assured family \ninvolvement in case and services planning in only 45% of cases—well \nbelow the national standard of 95%.  \nb.  ACS fails to ensure that the reunification services required are adequately \ntailored to ensure that the child in ACS custody can safely be returned \nhome.  Often the services Contract Agencies require and refer parents to \ndo not correspond to the conduct that led to the removal of the child from \nthe home in the first place.  For example, most parents are required to \nattend standardized anger management or parenting classes even though \nneither of those classes offer the particularized support that a parent may \nneed.  Upon information and belief, Contract Agencies do not evaluate \nservices to determine if services better suited to a parent’s needs are \navailable or, if they do, it is not until after the parent has completed \nstandardized classes.  Upon information and belief, Family Court judges \nare often reluctant to return children to their parents where the issue giving \nrise to the initial removal has not been addressed. \nc.  ACS fails to ensure that required services are evidence-based and \nrepresent recent innovations in the field.  For example, required mental \n101 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110055  ooff  112299\nhealth services often do not incorporate trauma-based practice or cognitive \nbehavioral therapy. \nd.  ACS fails to ensure that required services accomplish the purpose they \npurport to—ensuring children in ACS custody can be returned home \nwithin a reasonable period of time.  Upon information and belief, neither \nACS nor the Contract Agencies perform regular evaluations of what \nservices correspond to successful reunifications.   \ne.  ACS fails to ensure efficiency and coordination among multiple service \nproviders, fails to ensure that required services are not duplicative of one \nanother and fails to consider whether it is logistically possible for parents \nto comply with service plans (while also potentially searching for housing \nor employment, or working)—all of which delays children in foster care \nbeing returned to their parents.   \nf.  ACS fails to ensure services are available to parents so that children in \nACS custody can be returned home within a reasonable period of time.  \nContract Agencies frequently require parents to take a certain action or to \nobtain a certain service so that the child in foster care can return home, but \nthat same parent is not provided with critical assistance in taking that \naction or obtaining that service.  For example, many parents are required \nto obtain permanent housing before their children in ACS custody can be \nreturned.  However, ACS fails to provide assistance with completing \napplications for public housing or expediting those applications.  When \nmental health services are required, parents find they have no access to \n102 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110066  ooff  112299\nmental health services in their community or are unable to afford the \nappropriate services. \ng.  ACS also fails to ensure alternative services are available to parents so that \nchildren in ACS custody can be returned home within a reasonable period \nof time.  Upon information and belief, if suitable group classes do not \nexist, Contract Agencies do not seek out alternative arrangements, such as \ntherapy or counseling, to meet a parent’s needs more quickly. \n309.  ACS’s failure to ensure that reunification services are appropriately tailored, \neffective and sufficiently available prevents or delays reunification, even though many parents \ncould resume custody of their children if the proper services were provided consistent with \nfederal and state law and professional standards.  \n310.  These systemic failures have long been known to ACS.  In 2003, the New York \nCity Child Welfare Advisory Panel noted that ACS failed to ensure that parents knew how to get \ninformation about services or other issues, or whether or not someone from ACS or the Contract \nAgency was responsible for ensuring the service plan would be carried out and that services \nwould be provided.  The Long Road Home Study, which was conducted in 2009 in conjunction \nwith ACS, found that substantial numbers of parents did not receive necessary reunification \nservices due to both parents’ lack of participation and casework failures.   \n311.  ACS has failed to address these problems and children in ACS custody have \nsuffered as a direct result.  \n2.  ACS Fails To Ensure Timely Adoptions. \n312.  When a child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, federal and state \nlaw require ACS to file a petition to terminate parental rights unless certain compelling \n103 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110077  ooff  112299\ncircumstances exist and are documented.  ACS has delegated its responsibility to timely file TPR \npetitions to the Contract Agencies.  However, ACS fails to ensure that TPR petitions are timely \nfiled consistent with federal and state law. \n313.  Defendants are well aware of this failure.  In December 2011, ACS reported that \nNew York City was failing to meet federal and state law standards for the overwhelming \nmajority of children in ACS custody.  For FY 2010—the most recent 12-month period for which \nthis data is available—ACS reported that 94.9% of children who had been in ACS custody for \nthe past 18 months did not have a TPR petition filed.   \n314.  ACS’s failure to file TPR petitions in accordance with the time periods set by \nfederal and state law is not a new problem.  In the 2002 CFSR, the federal government reported \nthat in New York State, caseworker turnover, staffing shortages, transfer of cases and \ncaseworkers’ lack of familiarity with cases slowed down the TPR process.  In the 2002 CFSR \nReport, the federal government also reported that delays in Family Court, including “lengthy \nadjournments”, “w[ere] seen as the greatest barrier” to the timely termination of parental rights.  \nIn the 2009 CFSR, the federal government concluded that New York State met federal \nrequirements regarding timely termination of parental rights in only 62% of cases reviewed—far \nless than the 90% required to meet the national standard—and was not consistent in documenting \ncompelling reasons when a termination of parental rights petition was not filed.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the CFSR results for New York State are heavily influenced by New \nYork City’s child welfare system, which accounted for over 60% of children in foster care in \nNew York State in both 2002 and 2009.  \n315.  Once both parents’ rights have been either voluntarily surrendered or terminated, \na child is considered “freed” or legally available to be adopted into a permanent home and \n104 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110088  ooff  112299\nfamily.  New York State regulations require that a child be freed for adoption within 12 months \nof his or her permanency goal changing to adoption. \n316.  However, ACS fails to ensure that children in its custody are freed for adoption \nwithin a reasonable time period.  In New York City, it takes longer for a child in foster care to be \nfreed for adoption than anywhere else in the country.  Based on the most recent federal data \navailable, it takes nearly two times longer to be freed for adoption in New York City than in the \nrest of New York State (42.2 months versus 22.1 months), and 2.5 times longer to be freed for \nadoption in New York City than in the rest of the nation (42.2 months versus 16.8 months).   \n317.  ACS also fails to act on applications from potential adoptive families within the \ntime periods set by state law.   \n318.  When a foster parent or other person wants to adopt a child in foster care in New \nYork City, he or she must submit an application.  By state law, an adoption application must be \nacted upon within six months and such action must be sufficiently documented.   \n319.  Then a potential adoptive parent must undergo an adoption study during which his \nor her fitness to be an adoptive parent is assessed.  Completion of adoption studies are subject to \nstrict timelines under state law.  Priority for completion of an adoption study is determined by \nthe characteristics of the child that the applicant seeks to adopt.  Those who seek to adopt \nchildren with the age, racial and other characteristics of the highest proportion of children \nwaiting to be adopted are given first priority.  Second priority is given to those who seek to adopt \nphoto-listed children.  All other applicants are given third priority.  For applicants with first \npriority, an adoption study should be offered within 30 days.  An adoption study must be \ncompleted within four months of initiation, subject to appropriate documentation of an \nexception.   \n105 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  110099  ooff  112299\n320.  When a foster parent applies to adopt a child, the adoption study must be \ncompleted within two months of application when the child is legally free for adoption or within \nfour months of application when the child is not legally free for adoption. \n321.  Pursuant to state law, ACS must place a child who has been legally freed for \nadoption in an adoptive home within six months, or document an appropriate exception.  State \nlaw also requires that adoptions be finalized within 12 months of the child placement in an \nadoptive home.   \n322.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies comply \nwith the timelines set by state law for conducting adoption studies and acting on adoption \napplications. \n323.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that applications to become an \nadoptive parent are acted upon within six months as required by state law.   \n324.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies offer to \ncomplete adoption studies within six months.  \n325.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies offer to \ninitiate adoption studies for those with first priority within 30 days. \n326.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within four months of beginning the study or that an exception is \nappropriately documented. \n327.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within two months of an application by a foster parent to adopt a child \nwho is legally freed for adoption. \n106 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111100  ooff  112299\n328.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within four months of an application by a foster parent to adopt a child \nwho is not legally freed for adoption. \n329.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies place \nchildren who have been legally freed for adoption into adoptive homes within six months, or that \nan exception is appropriately documented. \n330.  ACS fails to ensure that children in its custody have finalized adoptions within 12 \nmonths of the child being placed in an adoptive home, as required by state law.  In September \n2012, ACS reported that 72% of children did not have finalized adoptions within 12 months of \nbeing placed in an adoptive home.7   \n331.  Defendants’ failures to ensure that Contract Agencies process adoption \napplications, conduct adoption studies, place children in adoptive homes and finalize adoptions \nwithin the time periods set by state law further delays providing these children in ACS custody—\nwho likely have already been in foster care for many months or even years—with a permanent \nhome and family.   \nE.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Timely Adjudication of Family Court Proceedings \nInvolving Children in Foster Care. \n332.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that Family Court proceedings are adjudicated in a \ntimely fashion consistent with state law contributes significantly to the length of time New York \nCity children spend in foster care without permanent homes and families. \n333.  State law requires that a child who is placed into foster care have a permanency \nhearing within eight months of being placed into foster care and every six months thereafter.  \n                                                 \n7 517 of the 1,825 children (28%) in adoptive placements on March 31, 2011 were adopted within 12 months \nof being adoptively placed. \n107 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111111  ooff  112299\nThat hearing must be completed within 30 days.  The purpose of permanency hearings is to \nmonitor the child’s safety and well-being, the family’s progress, and efforts to return the child \nhome or to find the child another permanent home.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail \nto ensure that all children in ACS custody receive timely permanency hearings as required by \nstate law.   \n334.  The Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in 2009 in conjunction with \nACS, detailed the following findings with respect to delays in Family Court proceedings \ninvolving children in ACS custody: \na.  The length of time between a child’s entry into foster care and the Family \nCourt’s completion of the fact-finding and disposition hearings was \nextremely long for many children; \nb.  Many children in ACS custody do not receive timely permanency hearings \nas required by state law; \nc.  The most common reasons for permanency hearing delays were that the \nContract Agency had not submitted the permanency hearing report on \ntime, that the Family Court did not have sufficient time for the hearing, \nthat Contract Agency caseworkers were not present, that the permanency \nhearing report did not sufficiently address the issues in the case, and that \nACS caseworkers were not present; and \nd.  Termination of parental rights proceedings were extremely delayed for \nmost children. \n108 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111122  ooff  112299\nAdditionally, the study noted that the number of adjournments and the length of time between \nadjournments of all types of Family Court proceedings contribute to children’s lengthy stays in \nfoster care in New York City.  The published study stated: \n“[T]he Court gives ACS and the [Contract Agencies] many \nchances (and multiple hearing adjournments) to present evidence \nand provide necessary services to parents, even after they have \nbeen slow and negligent in doing so.” \nFinally, the study found that a lack of accountability in Family Court proceedings contributes to \ndelays in placing children in ACS custody into permanent homes and families, stating: \n“The Court’s decision-making is hampered by poor-quality \ncasework by ACS and the [Contract Agencies].  The Court \ndepends on ACS and the [Contract Agencies] to provide \nappropriate services to children and families and to inform the \nCourt’s decision-making through assessments of the children’s \nprogress toward permanency . . . [J]udges and referees expressed \nfrustration with the quality of the agencies’ case practices – and the \nfact that many caseworkers seem to see their role as only \ndocumenting parents’ attendance at services rather than providing \nthe Court with clinical assessments of parents’ progress.  In \naddition . . . the parties infrequently make applications or motions \nto the Court for relief to address pressing issues and try to move \ncases forward.”   \n335.  In 2010, the New York County Lawyers’ Association Task Force on the Family \nCourt released a report recognizing two causes for delay in Family Court:  (1) a shortage of \nFamily Court judges and (2) a culture of delay.  The Task Force made a number of \nrecommendations to minimize delay and enhance the effectiveness of litigation, including:  \na.  scheduling trials where a child has been removed within 45 days of the \nfirst appearance; \nb.  requiring compliance with timely production and filing of documents, as \nwell as attendance at status and trial conferences;  \nc.  scheduling times certain for trial conferences; \n109 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111133  ooff  112299\nd.  holding trials in block times on consecutive days; \ne.  refraining from adjourning trials for more than 30 days, and then only for \ngood cause shown; and \nf.  disciplining attorneys and other personnel who are unprepared, late or fail \nto appear. \n336.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that ACS and Contract Agency attorneys and \ncaseworkers are appropriately staffed with caseloads consistent with professional standards and \ngiven necessary support further contributes to delays in Family Court proceedings.   \n337.  Upon information and belief, delays continue to plague the vast majority of \nFamily Court proceedings involving children in ACS custody in New York City. \n338.  Defendants’ failures result in delays in Family Court proceedings involving \nchildren in ACS custody in New York City and include: \na.  the State’s failure to ensure adequate judicial resources are devoted to \nFamily Court in New York City; \nb.  the State’s failure to provide Family Court judges in New York City with \nsufficient resources, including referees or law clerks with social work \nexperience; \nc.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that ACS and Contract Agency attorneys and \ncaseworkers have caseloads consistent with professional standards; \nd.  ACS’s failure to ensure that attorneys and caseworkers appear at all \nFamily Court proceedings prepared; \ne.  ACS’s failure to ensure that attorneys and caseworkers do not request \nadjournments absent good cause shown; \n110 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111144  ooff  112299\nf.  ACS’s failure to ensure that necessary paperwork is prepared in \naccordance with reasonable professional standards and submitted to the \nFamily Court in a timely fashion; and \ng.  ACS’s failure to ensure that caseworkers are trained to give the Court \ndetailed assessments of children and parents’ progress in accordance with \nreasonable professional standards. \n339.  A three- or six-month adjournment is a long time to a child in ACS custody who \nis struggling with the uncertainty and emotional harm of not knowing if or when he or she will \nbe moved again and of not having a permanent home and family to call his or her own.  \nDefendants have an obligation to ensure that all service providers, including caseworkers and \nattorneys, recognize the urgency of Family Court proceedings for Plaintiff Children, who are \nlanguishing in ACS custody. \n340.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that all reasonable efforts are \nmade to ensure the timely adjudication of Family Court proceedings involving children in its \ncustody, Plaintiff Children suffer harm by being forced to grow up in ACS custody rather than in \na permanent home.  Defendants’ failures substantially depart from reasonable professional \nstandards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of harms and violations of \nlegal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children.   \n111 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111155  ooff  112299\nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Substantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children against Defendants) \n341.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n342.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution to provide reasonable care to and to protect from harm a child it has \ntaken into its foster care custody. \n343.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants City of New York, ACS, \nGladys Carrión, in her official capacity, State of New York, OCFS and Sheila J. Poole, in her \nofficial capacity, constitute a policy, pattern, practice or custom that is inconsistent with the \nexercise of accepted professional judgment and amounts to deliberate indifference to the \nconstitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all Named Plaintiff Children and \nPlaintiff Children.  As a result, all Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children have been, \nand are at risk of being, deprived of substantive due process rights conferred upon them by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n344.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment while in foster care; \nb.  the right to protection from unnecessary intrusions into the child’s \nemotional well-being while in government custody; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions into the child’s emotional well-being while in government \ncustody; \n112 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111166  ooff  112299\nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody;  \ne.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and \nassumptions of government custody; and \nf.  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children against Defendants) \n345.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n346.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants City of New York, ACS, \nGladys Carrión, in her official capacity, State of New York, OCFS and Sheila J. Poole, in her \nofficial capacity, constitute a policy, pattern, practice or custom that is inconsistent with the \nexercise of professional judgment and amounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights.  As a result, all Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children have been, \nand are at risk of being, deprived of the right to a permanent home and family derived from the \nFirst Amendment right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people \nand the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections.  \n113 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  111177  ooff  112299\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children, Plaintiff Children and the Public Advocate \nagainst the State Defendants and by the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children \nagainst the City Defendants)  \n347.

Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n353.  The Agreements for the purchase of foster care services between ACS and the \nContract Agencies constitute valid, binding and enforceable contracts.8   \n354.  Under the terms of the Agreements, ACS pays hundreds of millions of dollars to \nContract Agencies that agree to “provide comprehensive family foster care services as set forth \nin this Agreement, the Law, court orders and mandates, ACS Policies, the Fiscal Manual”9 and \nseveral appendices to each Agreement.  Agreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster \nCare Services Part II, Section 2.01(A) (General Requirements). \n355.  Under the terms of the Agreement—and by law—the management and \nsupervisory staff of ACS, on behalf of the Commissioner of ACS, “has the ultimate \nresponsibility for the protection and preservation of the welfare of each child receiving services”, \nand “has the ultimate authority for making all decisions relative to the welfare of such child”.  \nAgreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster Care Services Part II, Section 4.01(A) \n(Responsibility and Authority of ACS and Procedure for Final Decisions on Issues Related to \nServices Provided to the Client). \n                                                 \n8 To the best of our information and belief, the Agreements, which are listed in Appendix A, were current as of \nNovember 2014 (see ¶ 177) and are still in force today.  Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a copy of an excerpt of one \nsuch Agreement between ACS and a Contract Agency, which has been modified to include the relevant portion of \nthe Agreement.  The Agreements are substantively identical from Contract Agency to Contract Agency, with the \nexception of the contracting parties and the contract amount.   \n9 This language may differ to account for the type of foster placement services provided for in the Agreement \nbut, in substance, the provisions are identical. \n118 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  112222  ooff  112299\n356.  City Defendants have breached and failed to enforce the Agreements, which were \nintended for the benefit of the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children.   \n357.  The Agreements state that “ACS and the Contractor agree that the fundamental \npurpose of [the] Agreement is to provide the best available services, care and treatment to Foster \nChildren who are entrusted to the Contractor’s care, and further to ensure that the health, welfare \nand fundamental rights of the Foster Children shall be the guiding principle for all decisions \nwhich affect their lives.”  Agreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster Care Services \nPart II, Section 4.01(B) (Responsibility and Authority of ACS and Procedure for Final Decisions \non Issues Related to Services Provided to the Client). \n358.  As a direct and causal result of City Defendants’ breach of the Agreements, the \nNamed Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children have been harmed.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff Children respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \nb.  Order that Plaintiff Children may maintain this action as a class action \npursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nc.

Require that ACS \nindependently and periodically verify that each Contract Agency \nwith which ACS places children meets such standards, and that its \nverification process and the results shall be public information. \n5.  Enjoin ACS from placing children with any Contract Agency \nunless the Agency has demonstrated, and ACS has ascertained, \nthat it conducts permanency planning, including concurrent \nplanning, that it has the resources to provide individualized and \neffective reunification services and that it has the resources to \ndevelop and implement individualized adoptive recruitment for \nchildren whose permanency goal is adoption.  Require that, in \nconducting this assessment, ACS be guided by timelines to achieve \npermanency goals set by ACS in accordance with federal and state \nlaw and accepted professional standards.  Require that ACS \nindependently and periodically verify that each Contract Agency \nwith which it places children shall meet these standards, and rank \nthe agencies in their effectiveness in doing so.  Require that their \nverification process and the results, including the Contract Agency \nrankings, shall be public information. \n6.  Require that ACS develop and fund post-permanency services of \nsufficient duration to provide all possible support for the successful \nreunification, guardianship or adoption of foster children. \n122 \n \n\n  CCaassee  11::1155--ccvv--0055227733--LLTTSS--HHBBPP      DDooccuummeenntt  8961      FFiilleedd  1122//2289//1155      PPaaggee  112266  ooff  112299\n7.

Require that ACS collect and maintain detailed \ninformation on this, which shall be public record. \n8.

See Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 378. \nv.  Named Plaintiff Children satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because the Commissioner ofOCFS has \"acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole\".

(the “AACWA”) (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983), New York State Social Services Law and\ncommon law contract law against the City of New York (the “City”), the New York City\nAdministration for Children’s Services (“ACS”), ACS Commissioner Gladys Carrion (“Carrion”\nand, together with the City and ACS, the “City Defendants”),1 the New York State Office of\nChildren and Family Services (“OCFS”) and OCFS Acting Commissioner Sheila J.

(See generally Complaint; Amended Complaint.) \nPlaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint on December 29, 2015.  The Court has jurisdiction of\nthis action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nPlaintiffs now move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, for final\napproval of the proposed Consent Decree agreed to between the Plaintiffs and the State\nDefendants in this action.  (See Docket Entry No. 150-1 (the “Consent Decree”).)  Final approval\nis opposed by the City Defendants, as well as by two separate groups of intervenors: the Parent\nAdvocates (comprised of The Bronx Defenders, The Brooklyn Defender Service, The Center for\nFamily Representation, and Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem) and the Children’s\nAdvocates (comprised of Lawyers for Children, The Children’s Law Center of New York, and\nThe Legal Aid Society).3  A fairness hearing regarding the proposed settlement was held on\nAugust 5, 2016.  Two parents of children in foster care filed written objections and were given\nthe opportunity to speak at the hearing as well; one parent appeared and spoke.\nThe Court has carefully considered the parties’ voluminous submissions, as well\nas the arguments proffered at the August 5, 2016, fairness hearing.  For the reasons set forth\nbelow, Plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the settlement is denied, and the conditional\ncertification of the Plaintiff class is vacated.\n3 On July 12, 2016, the Court granted both the Parent Advocates’ and the\nChildren’s Advocates’ unopposed motions to intervene in this action for the\nlimited purpose of objecting to the proposed settlement.

(See generally Complaint.)\nOne day later, on July 9, 2015, the State Defendants contacted the Plaintiffs\nseeking to discuss a potential settlement.  (Docket Entry No. 225, Declaration of Julie A. North\nin Support of the Motion for Final Approval (“North Decl.”), at ¶ 11.)  Plaintiffs and the State\nDefendants thereafter discussed a settlement by phone, and then in three days of in-person\nmeetings.  (North Decl., at ¶¶ 12-13.)  An agreement in principle was reached on July 20, 2015,\ntwelve days after the Complaint was filed.  (North Decl., at ¶ 13.)  The parties continued\nnegotiating the specifics of a settlement through September 2015.  (Id.)\nOn October 22, 2015, Plaintiffs and State Defendants filed the proposed Consent\nDecree with the Court, purporting to settle Plaintiffs’ claims against the State Defendants.  (See\ngenerally Docket Entry No. 50.)  Plaintiffs represent that the Consent Decree was negotiated\nover the course of several months by counsel for the Named Plaintiff Children and the Public\nAdvocate, based on the Public Advocate’s investigation of the child welfare system in New York\nCity and the State Defendants’ understanding of extensive public reporting on the state of the\nNew York City foster care system.  (See Docket Entry No. 224, Memorandum of Law in\nSupport of the Motion for Final Approval of Settlement (“Pl. Memo”), at p. 19.)  Plaintiffs\nfurther represent that the Consent Decree is the “product of months of robust arm’s length\nnegotiations” between the Plaintiffs and State Defendants and that, over the course of these\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 4 of 21\nseveral months, the parties exchanged numerous drafts of the proposed agreement and engaged\nin multiple conferences, both telephonic and in person, before filing the proposed Consent\nDecree.  (See Docket Entry No. 226, Declaration of Marcia Robinson Lowry in Support of the\nMotion for Final Approval (“Lowry Decl.”), at ¶ 4; see also North Decl., at ¶¶ 11-15.)\nAfter the proposed Consent Decree was filed, the Court entered an order directing\nthe parties to commence motion practice, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e),\nrequesting Court approval of the Consent Decree.  (Docket Entry No. 51.)\nIn early December 2015, before the commencement of the motion practice, the\nCity Defendants informed Plaintiffs of their intention to file a motion to dismiss the Complaint. \n(See Docket Entry No. 80.)  In response, Plaintiffs proposed to amend the Complaint to address\nthe issues the City Defendants indicated they planned to raise (see id.), and filed an Amended\nComplaint on December 29, 2015.  (Docket Entry No. 91.)    \nThe Amended Complaint alleges, on behalf of a purported class of approximately\n10,295 children in the New York City foster care system, that the system: (i) fails to exercise\nsufficient oversight over contract agencies to which the City has delegated care of the purported\nclass of children to ensure that they comply with federal and state law, ACS policies, and the\nterms of contracts with the City; (ii) fails to ensure that caseworkers are assigned manageable\ncaseloads or receive appropriate training and supervision; (iii) fails to develop and implement a\nprocess for placing children into foster placements that matches children’s needs; (iv) fails to\nensure that adequate case plans are timely developed and implemented; (v) fails to ensure that\nchildren in foster care are timely placed in stable permanent homes; and (vi) fails to take\nreasonable steps to ensure timely adjudication of family court proceedings involving children in\nACS custody.  (See generally Amended Complaint.)  As against the State Defendants, the\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 5 of 21\nNamed Plaintiff Children, on behalf of a putative class, assert claims for violation of substantive\ndue process under the Fourteenth Amendment, violation of a right to permanent home and\nfamily derived from the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and violations of the\nAACWA.  Plaintiff James joins the Named Plaintiff Children in asserting the AACWA claim\nagainst the State Defendants.  As against the City Defendants, the Named Plaintiff Children, on\nbehalf of a putative class, allege the same claims brought against the State Defendants as well as\nclaims under the New York State Social Services Law and for breach of contract based on the\ncontracts between the City and the contract agencies described above.  (See generally Complaint\n¶¶ 341-358.)\nOn January 20, 2016, the Plaintiffs and State Defendants filed their joint motion\nfor preliminary approval of the settlement (Docket Entry No. 95), which was opposed by the\nCity Defendants (Docket Entry No. 106).  On April 5, 2016, the Court held a hearing on\nPlaintiffs’ and State Defendants’ joint motion for preliminary approval.  Following several\nCourt-directed adjustments to the Consent Decree and settlement notice materials, the Court\nentered an order on April 22, 2016, preliminarily approving the settlement and conditionally\ncertifying a settlement class consisting of all children who are, or will be, in foster care custody\nof the Commissioner of ACS during the duration of the Consent Decree.  (Docket Entry No.\n154.)  That order set a May 13, 2016, deadline for publication of notice to settlement class\nmembers; a June 21, 2016, deadline for objections to the Consent Decree; and a July 15, 2016,\ndeadline for filing of a motion for final approval of the settlement.  (See id.)  The order also\nscheduled a fairness hearing for August 5, 2016, at 10:30 a.m., for final evaluation of the\nConsent Decree.  (Id.)\nPlaintiffs filed their motion for final approval of the settlement on July 15, 2016. \nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 6 of 21\n(Docket Entry No. 223.)  In response, the Court has received: the Parent Advocates’ objections\nto the proposed settlement from (Docket Entry No. 221); the Parent Advocates’ opposition to\nfinal approval of the proposed settlement (Docket Entry No. 234); the Children’s Advocates’\nobjections to the proposed settlement (Docket Entry No. 187); the City Defendants’ opposition\nto final approval of the proposed settlement (Docket Entry No. 231); and letters of objection\nfrom two parents of putative class members.\nThe Proposed Consent Decree\nThe proposed Consent Decree purports to secure relief from the State Defendants\nfor the putative class primarily through the creation of two oversight positions: a Monitor (see\nConsent Decree § 6) and a Research Expert (see Consent Decree § 7).  The Monitor, who would\nbe retained by the Commissioner of OCFS, with input from Plaintiff Children’s counsel and the\nPublic Advocate, would be tasked with reviewing and evaluating unspecified alleged systemic\nissues affecting New York City’s foster care system that reflect widespread and ongoing\nnoncompliance with federal and state statutes, regulations and policies.  (See Consent Decree\n§§ 6.1 & 6.2.)  The Commissioner of OCFS would develop the criteria by which the Monitor\nreviews and evaluates systemic issues within the foster care system, and the Monitor would\nreport his or her findings and make recommendations regarding the safety, permanency and\nwell-being of foster children in New York City.  (See Consent Decree § 6.2.)  The Monitor\nwould be granted necessary resources, as well as access to records and data on foster care\nprograms as determined by the Commissioner of OCFS, and would prepare quarterly reports\noutlining his or her activities, findings and recommendations for improvements to the City’s\nfoster care system.  (See Consent Decree § 6.4.)  These quarterly reports would be reviewed by\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 7 of 21\nthe Commissioner of OCFS in conjunction with ACS in order to determine what actions may be\nneeded to address issues raised in the reports, and ACS would thereafter be directed to prepare\ncorrective action plans for the Commissioner’s approval.  (See Consent Decree § 6.5.)  The\nMonitor is proposed to serve an initial term of three years, and is to be reviewed at that time by\nthe parties, and further reviewed every two years thereafter.  (See Consent Decree § 6.6)\nThe Research Expert is to be retained by ACS at the direction and approval of the\nCommissioner of OCFS, with input from counsel for the Plaintiff Children and the Public\nAdvocate.  (See Consent Decree §§ 7.1 & 7.2.)  The Research Expert would be charged with\nconducting reviews of case records of children in the custody of ACS in order to determine\ncompliance with relevant federal and state laws, regulations and policies related to the well-\nbeing of children.  (See Consent Decree § 7.3.)  The Research Expert’s proposed research\nprotocols and methodology (which are as yet entirely unspecified) would be subject to approval\nby the Commissioner of OCFS, who would consider recommended changes from Plaintiff\nChildren’s counsel and the Public Advocate.  (See id.)  The Research Expert would be\nresponsible for producing two types of reports: (1) reports on individual cases where voluntary\nagencies and/or ACS have violated federal or state statutes, regulations or policies, in which the\nResearch Expert would recommend corrective action and conduct follow-up reviews; and (2) bi-\nannual aggregate reports summarizing the major results of all case records reviewed over the\npreceding 6-month period.  (See Consent Decree §§ 7.4 & 7.5.)  The Research Expert is to serve\nan initial term of two years, and is to be reviewed at that time by the parties, and further\nreviewed every two years thereafter.  (See Consent Decree § 7.6.)\nIn consideration for this relief, the Consent Decree includes a broad claim release,\nwhich provides that the Plaintiff Children and Public Advocate will withdraw with prejudice all\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 8 of 21\nclaims and remedies sought in Amended Complaint, and release any claims relating to or arising\nfrom any claims raised in Amended Complaint, as against the State Defendants.  (See Consent\nDecree § 10.1.)  The Consent Decree also contains a covenant not to sue as against the State\nDefendants, which precludes all suits for injunctive or declaratory relief for the life of the\nagreement – seven years – based on facts or causes of action set out in the Amended Complaint.\n(See Consent Decree § 10.2.4)\nObjections to the Proposed Consent Decree\nBoth the Parent Advocate Intervenors and the Children’s Advocate Intervenors\nhave submitted objections to the proposed Consent Decree, highlighting numerous perceived\ndeficiencies in the settlement terms.  The concerns of both groups of intervenors generally\noverlap.  The intervenors argue that the relief provided in the Consent Decree is inadequate in\nthat: the roles and objectives of the Research Expert and Monitor are vague and ill-defined; the\nremedies conferred by the Consent Decree do not address the alleged civil rights violations\nidentified in the Amended Complaint; the additional oversight provided by the Monitor and\nResearch Expert is duplicative of the work of OCFS’s New York City Regional Office\n(“NYCRO”); the settlement precludes the possibility of litigation to reform harmful practices\ncarried out by the State Defendants; and the parents of children in foster care may be precluded\nfrom participation in important decision-making with respect to their children’s placement.  (See\n4 The covenant not to sue does not cover individual actions against the State\nDefendants for damages or injunctive relief, or class-wide or systemic claims\nagainst the State Defendants that do not relate factually or legally to the claims\nraised in the Amended Complaint against the State Defendants.  (See Consent\nDecree § 10.3.)  It is difficult to conceive of a systemic claim regarding foster\ncare that would not relate factually or legally to the claims raised in the Amended\nComplaint.\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 9 of 21\ngenerally Docket Entry Nos. 187 & 221.)  The intervenors also take issue with the fact that the\nConsent Decree was agreed to prior to the exchange of discovery in this case.  Perhaps most\nnotably, the intervenors protest the seven-year duration of the Consent Decree and covenant not\nto sue, arguing that the length of the agreement is unprecedented and unjustified, that the terms\nof the release and covenant are overly broad and that the covenant will strip the Plaintiffs of a\ncrucial tool for pursuing systemic change for an extraordinary period of time.  (See generally id.)\nThe Court has also received objections from two non-class member parents of\nchildren who are in foster care.  One argues that: counsel for the Named Plaintiff Children have\nnot kept the children or their parents sufficiently informed about this case; the lawsuit does not\nadequately address the treatment of children in foster care system, including the high level of\nabuse that these children allegedly endure; and that the lawsuit is a front for the passage of\n“shady money.”  This parent also objects to the fact that the suit does not seek any monetary\nrelief.5  The other parental objection submitted asserts generally that the parent was not kept\nabreast of developments in the suit; that ACS keeps children in foster care for excessive periods\nof time in order to make money; and that she has been retaliated against in response to her\nadvocacy for changes in the City’s foster care system.  (See Docket Entry No. 255.)  Both non-\nclass member parent objectors were permitted an opportunity to speak at the August 5, 2016,\nfairness hearing.  One parent spoke regarding issues relating to the particulars of her son’s foster\ncare case, her opposition to the manner in which this lawsuit has been structured and conducted,\nand systemic issues.  The other parent was not present at the hearing.\n5 This parent’s objection was filed under seal as authorized by an Order of this\nCourt.  (Docket entry no. 257.)\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 9\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 10 of 21\nDISCUSSION\nLegal Standard for Settlement Approval\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), “[t]he claims, issues, or\ndefenses of a certified class may be settled . . . only with the court’s approval.”  See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(e).  The Court may only approve a settlement upon finding that its terms are “fair,\nreasonable, and adequate.”  See id.  This determination falls squarely within the trial court’s\ndiscretion.  See Kelen v. World Fin. Network Nat. Bank, 302 F.R.D. 56, 68 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“It\nis within a trial court's discretion to approve a proposed class action settlement.”); Maywalt v.\nPaker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1078 (2d Cir. 1995) (“The ultimate responsibility\nto ensure that the interests of class members are not subordinated to the interests of either the\nclass representatives or class counsel rests with the district court.”).  \nA district court examining a proposed class action settlement must examine “both\nthe settlement’s terms and the negotiating process leading to the settlement.”   Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 116 (2d Cir. 2005).  A court must first “review the\nnegotiating process leading up to the settlement for procedural fairness, to ensure that the\nsettlement resulted from an arm’s-length, good faith negotiation between experienced and skilled\nlitigators.”  Charron v. Wiener, 731 F.3d 241, 247 (2d Cir. 2013).  A presumption of procedural\nfairness attaches to settlements that are negotiated at arm’s length by experienced counsel.  See,\ne.g., In re Austrian and German Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 173-74 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). \nOnce the court has determined whether the settlement was negotiated in a procedurally fair\nmanner, it moves on to evaluate the settlement’s substantive terms in light of the nine factors set\nout by the Second Circuit in City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corporation, 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir.\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 11 of 21\n1974).6  See Charron, 731 F.3d at 247.  \nCourts evaluating class action settlements must remain “mindful of the ‘strong\njudicial policy in favor of settlements, particularly in the class action context.’”  Wal-Mart, 396\nF.3d at 116 (quoting In re PaineWebber Ltd. P’ships Litig., 147 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 1998)). \nMoreover, the adequacy of a settlement should not be judged “in comparison with the possible\nrecovery in the best of all possible worlds.”  Meredith Corp. v. SESAC, LLC, 87 F. Supp. 3d\n650, 665 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).  Rather, a court need only determine that a settlement falls within a\n“range of reasonableness.”  Id. at 666.  “Due to the presumption in favor of settlement, [a]bsent\nfraud or collusion, courts should be hesitant to substitute [their] judgment for that of the parties\nwho negotiated the settlement.”  Peoples v. Annucci, No. 11 CV 2694-SAS, 2016 WL 1464613,\nat *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nevertheless,\nwhile a district court must “stop short of the detailed and thorough investigation that it would\nundertake if it were actually trying the case,” it must also “eschew any rubber stamp approval in\nfavor of an independent evaluation” of the settlement’s fairness.  See Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463.  \n6 The nine Grinnell factors are: (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of\nthe litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the\nproceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing\nliability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the\nclass action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a\ngreater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light\nof the best possible recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the\nsettlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of\nlitigation.  See Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463.  \nWhere, as here, the settlement calls solely for injunctive relief, the final three \nGrinnell factors are not at issue, and the fifth factor is evaluated in light of the\nlikelihood of establishing remedies rather than damages.  See Ingles v. Toro, 438\nF. Supp. 2d 203, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.); Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 185\nF.R.D. 152, 162 (S.D.N.Y.1999).\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 11\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 12 of 21\nProcedural Fairness\nAs previously noted, courts must evaluate the procedural fairness of the\nnegotiation of the settlement in conjunction with reviewing the agreement’s substantive terms. \nCharron, 731 F.3d at 247.  In assessing procedural fairness, “a proposed settlement is presumed\nfair, reasonable, and adequate if it culminates from “arm’s-length negotiations between\nexperienced, capable counsel after meaningful discovery.”  Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.,\n570 F. App’x 1 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added); see also Lizondro-Garcia v. Kefi LLC, 300\nF.R.D. 169, 178 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). \nPlaintiffs assert that, because the Consent Decree was negotiated at arm’s length\nby experienced counsel, it is entitled to a presumption of fairness.  See In re Austrian and\nGerman Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d at 173-74.  Plaintiffs proffer that both Julie North\nand Marcia Robinson Lowry are experienced and capable litigators in the areas of class action\nand children’s rights litigation, respectively.  (North Decl., at ¶ 9; Lowry Decl., at ¶ 2.)  Plaintiffs\nfurther represent that the proposed Consent Decree is the product of months of “robust arm’s\nlength negotiations” and that, over the course of several weeks beginning in July 2015, counsel\nfor the Named Plaintiff Children, the Public Advocate and the State Defendants engaged in a\nseries of meetings, calls and debates concerning a potential settlement.  (Lowry Decl., at ¶ 4;\nNorth Decl., at ¶¶ 11-15.)  Nevertheless, the record before the Court makes it clear that the\ncontours of the settlement were agreed to in principle a mere week after the Complaint was filed,\nand that the parties have not engaged in “meaningful discovery” beyond a purported\ninvestigation into the state of New York City’s child welfare system and an examination of city,\nstate and federal public reports detailing the failings of the child welfare system in New York\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 12\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 13 of 21\nCity.7  In particular, and as Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged at the fairness hearing, there has\nbeen no investigation focused on the State Defendants’ alleged non-compliance with legal\nprovisions governing its role in the child welfare system.  Plaintiffs do not demonstrate how their\npurported pre-litigation investigation connected meaningfully to the Named Plaintiff Children or\nto the specific allegations regarding State agency violations that are contained within the\nAmended Complaint.  In the absence of any “meaningful discovery”8 into the merits of the\nclaims asserted against the settling defendants by the Named Plaintiff Children, the settlement is\nnot entitled to a presumption of procedural fairness.       \nThe cases cited by Plaintiffs for the proposition that courts routinely approve\nsettlements in which limited or no formal discovery has been conducted are inapposite.  The\ncourt in Handschu v. Special Servs. Div., 605 F. Supp. 1384 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) did recognize that\ndiscovery need not be “formal discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,” but further\nnoted that counsel must be able to demonstrate access to “sufficient information regarding the\nfacts of their case.”  Id. at 1394 (emphasis added).  While Plaintiffs purport to have assessed\npublicly available information regarding the New York City foster care system, they have made\nno showing that they investigated the particular circumstances of the Named Plaintiff Children,\n7 Plaintiffs proffer that the facts in the Amended Complaint were well known to the\nState Defendants in light of their responsibility in overseeing ACS.  However, as\nthe City Defendants point out, State Defendants did not seek input from ACS in\ncontextualizing these facts, nor do the State Defendants appear to admit that these\nfacts establish violations of federal law. \n8 As the Children’s Advocates point out, the paucity of the record here is\nparticularly apparent when compared with that in another class action targeting\nNew York City’s child welfare system, Marisol A. v. Giuliani, where “[e]xtensive\ndiscovery had been conducted, including over 200 deposition days, over 100,000\npages of documents provided by the City and State, and the exchange of extensive\nexpert reports.”  185 F.R.D. at 163.\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 13\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 14 of 21\nthe State’s compliance with the Constitution and federal and state law, or the allegations of\nabuse and systemic deficiencies in the Amended Complaint.  In In re Nissan\nRadiator/Transmission Cooler Litigation, No. 10CV7493-VB, 2013 WL 4080946 (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 30, 2013), the court noted that “[the] plaintiffs conducted an investigation prior to\ncommencing the action, retained experts, and engaged in confirmatory discovery in support of\nthe proposed settlement.”  Id. at *5.  That level of discovery clearly exceeds the efforts Plaintiffs\nrepresent they have undertaken here.  And in Van Oss v. New York, No. 10CV7524-SAS, 2012\nWL 2550959 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012), the court recognized that “although there ha[d] been no\nformal discovery, plaintiffs’ counsel ha[d] done an adequate factual investigation to be\nthoroughly apprised of the merits of the case.”  Id. at *1.  Here, however, while Plaintiffs assert\nthat they have investigated the general state of affairs of the New York City foster care system,\nthey have failed to proffer anything indicative of an investigation into the merits of the Named\nPlaintiff Children’s – or the putative class members’ – claims against the State Defendants.\nThe Children’s Advocates, Parents’ Advocates and City Defendants all point to\nthe thin evidentiary record in this case as a factor undermining the settlement’s procedural\nfairness, arguing persuasively that the Plaintiffs and State Defendants could not possibly have\ndeveloped a proper appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of the plaintiff children’s\nclaims against the State Defendants – and, in turn, the propriety of the proposed remedies\n– before entering into the settlement.  See, e.g., In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel\nTank Prod. Liability Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 814 (3d Cir. 1995) (“The inchoate stage of case\ndevelopment reduces our confidence that the proceedings had advanced to the point that counsel\ncould fairly, safely, and appropriately decide to settle the action.”).  Although none of the parties\nopposing settlement have proffered affirmative evidence indicating collusive activity, the near-\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 14\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 15 of 21\ntotal abandonment of the settling parties’ obligation to assess the merits of the Named Plaintiff\nChildren’s claims leads the Court to conclude that the Consent Decree is not entitled to a\npresumption of procedural fairness, and that the proponents have failed to establish that it was\ndeveloped under conditions that were procedurally fair to the putative class.\nApplication of the Grinnell Factors\n1.  Complexity, Expense, and Duration of the Litigation\nThis case fits squarely within the common understanding that class actions are\n“inherently complex” and therefore benefit from settlement, which “avoids the costs, delays, and\nmultitude of other problems” associated with complex litigation.  In re Austrian and German\nBank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d at 174.  However, here, the Plaintiffs’ agreement will\nterminate this litigation only as to the State Defendants, and the litigation will remain ongoing as\nto the City Defendants.  Plaintiffs characterize this settlement as the first of two steps, and\nrecognize that there will be a continuing need to litigate against the City Defendants.  (See Pl.\nMemo at 4.)  Plaintiffs assert that actively pursuing this litigation against both sets of defendants\nwould be more complex and expensive, but many of the examples of costs that Plaintiffs claim\nwould be mitigated by the settlement – fact discovery, expert discovery, briefing, and\npresentation of evidence as to both the 19 Named Plaintiff Children and the broader class of\nthousands of children – will be required in order to effectively continue this litigation against the\nCity Defendants.  As such, this factor is at best neutral with regards to the Consent Decree.\n2.  Reaction of the Class to the Proposed Settlement\nThe “reaction of the class to the settlement” is one of the most significant factors\ncourts consider when weighing the fairness of a proposed settlement.  See Grinnell, 495 F.2d at\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 15\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 16 of 21\n463.  No objections by class members to the Consent Decree have been received.  This fact is\nneither surprising nor particularly significant here, because the class is composed entirely of\nminor children who are in the foster care system, individuals who are both uniquely vulnerable\nand, because of their age and dependence on others, generally ill-suited to appreciate the stakes\nof litigation involving their interests and to be effective advocates on their own behalf.  Such\nfactors are particularly significant where, as here, the proposed settlement is with defendants\nwho are not directly involved in the individual plaintiffs’ day to day custody issues and would\nhave no immediate impact on the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances.  The Court concludes that\nthe objections to the Consent Decree by the Children’s Advocates and the Parent Advocates are\nsignificant for purposes of this factor of the Grinnell analysis, as these organizations are well\nsuited to advocate on behalf of many of those whose interests would be affected by the Consent\nDecree.\nThe response by the intervenor organizations is starkly negative.  Both argue that\nthe Consent Decree has no provisions to provide meaningful, concrete benefits to the class; that\nthe Consent Decree is entirely vague about the roles, responsibilities, and authority of the\nMonitor and Research Expert; and that the Consent Decree’s seven-year term is an\nunprecedented waiver that would significantly stymie future efforts at reforming the foster care\nsystem in New York.  As discussed in detail below, the Court finds many of the intervenors’\narguments persuasive.\nFirst, the intervenors argue that the Consent Decree does not provide concrete\nbenefits to the class.  Plaintiffs walk an unusual line in defending the fact that the Consent\nDecree calls only for the creation of two temporary oversight roles and itself provides no\nsubstantive changes to the foster care system.  Although Plaintiffs recognize that the State has\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 16\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 17 of 21\nultimate authority over the foster care system, they repeatedly characterize the State’s role as one\nof oversight, and argue that the Consent Decree will strengthen the State’s oversight capacity. \nPlaintiff’s argument is, however, undermined by its own premise: if the State-level oversight\nroles are to be meaningful at all, the State must be able to compel ACS to make operational\nchanges; if the State has this power, describing its role as merely one of oversight is a\nmischaracterization.  By contrast, prior settlements with OCFS, like the one in Marisol A.,\ncontained significant and detailed requirements.\nEven if the Court were to conclude that the Monitor and Research Expert\nstructure contemplated by the Consent Decree were adequate in theory, the wholesale lack of\nspecificity within the Consent Decree as to the goals, objectives, and responsibilities of these\ntwo new officials raises significant questions as to the reasonableness of the settlement.  See\nMartens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 181 F.R.D. 243, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (noting that the Court\ncannot “declare its duty to evaluate the settlement complete before the parties more meaningfully\nclarify what it does”).  The absence of specificity with respect to problems to be studied and\ngoals to be achieved is particularly striking given the extent to which the Complaint identifies\nnumerous alleged systemic problems.  The Consent Decree leaves it to the Monitor and Research\nExpert to recommend areas of attention and goals to the Commissioner of the OCFS, and gives\nthe OCFS final say over what problems will be recognized at all and what, if anything, is to be\ndone about them.  The covenant not to sue provisions of the Consent Decree would insulate the\nOCFS from any systemic challenge to its actions across a broad swath of foster care and\nadoption issues for seven years.  The Plaintiffs assert that the Consent Decree has specific\nprovisions about how the goals and objectives of the Monitor and Research Expert will be\ndefined, but this procedural specificity is no substitute for concrete commitments as to issues to\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 17\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 18 of 21\nbe addressed and remedial actions to be taken, in the absence of which the Court’s ability to\ndetermine whether the creation of these offices constitutes adequate compensation for the release\nand protection from future litigation is limited at best.\nFinally, the intervenors argue that the seven-year covenant not to sue is\nunprecedented in its duration.  Plaintiffs have proffered no example of a similarly long waiver;\neach of their examples of consent decrees whose ultimate term was similarly lengthy involved a\nsignificantly shorter term that was extended by order of the overseeing court.  None of those\ncourts approved a seven-year fixed term of release.  Such a lengthy term, especially where the\ncovenant would bar any systemic claims similar to the sweeping allegations raised by Plaintiffs\nin their Complaint, would be questionable even if the consideration provided by the settlement\nwere clearly and effectively addressed to identified problems.  On the current record, where the\nonly undertakings by the settling defendants are to hire unspecified individuals to identify as yet\nunspecified problems in another agency and make recommendations that the released and\nprotected parties are not bound to follow, the Court concludes that the intervenors’ concerns are\nwell founded.\nThe Court therefore concludes that the reaction of the class weighs heavily\nagainst approval of the proposed Consent Decree.\n3.  Stage of the Proceedings and Discovery Completed\nAs discussed above in relation to procedural fairness, the record before the Court\nindicates that this settlement was sought and negotiated at an extremely early stage in the\nproceedings – before discovery had even commenced, let alone before significant discovery had\nbeen exchanged.  The State Defendants reached out to Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding settlement\nonly one day after the Complaint was filed in this action.  (North Decl., at ¶¶ 10-11.)  A\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 18\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 19 of 21\nsettlement was discussed over the following week, with an agreement in principle reached\ntwelve days after the Complaint was filed.  (North Decl., at ¶¶ 10-13.)  In a case of this\ncomplexity – with a 111-page Complaint asserting five causes of action under the Constitution\nand various statutes – resolution of all issues within twelve days (even if negotiation of the\nprecise language of that resolution took longer) is difficult, if not impossible, to square with a\nconclusion that both parties fully appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their litigation\npositions prior to reaching a settlement.  See In re Austrian and German Bank Holocaust Litig.,\n80 F. Supp. 2d at 173 (“The parties have less information on the relative strengths and\nweaknesses of claims when a settlement is arrived at early in the life of a case. Therefore,\nmembers of the settlement class and the Court may be hindered in their ability to determine the\nfairness of the settlement.”).  The stage of the litigation at which settlement was reached weighs\nagainst approval of the proposed Consent Decree.\nSimilarly, the record indicates that discovery was not exchanged between the\nsettling parties prior to settlement.  Although Plaintiffs’ counsel represent that they spent\nconsiderable time investigating the facts underlying the Complaint prior to filing that document,\nthere is no indication that they participated in the kind of “sufficiently adversarial” pretrial\ndiscovery that would demonstrate that the Plaintiffs attempted “to ferret out facts helpful to the\nprosecution of the suit.”  Id. at 176 (quoting Martens, 181 F.R.D. at 263.)\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that this factor weighs against approval of the\nproposed Consent Decree.\n4.  Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages, and Maintaining the Class\nThe parties have discussed the remaining Grinnell factors in combination, and the\nCourt adopts that grouping for ease of analysis.  When considering the fifth factor, the court may\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 19\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 20 of 21\nconsider how the relief granted by the settlement compares to the scope of relief potentially\navailable after trial.  Cf. Ingles, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 214 (approving settlement where the court\nfound that it would be “difficult to imagine that the Court would have imposed, following trial,\nsignificantly more extensive and detailed relief”).  Here, given the State Defendants’ admitted\npower to both oversee and direct action by the New York City foster care authorities, the\nabsence of specificity as to issues or corrective actions in the Consent Decree suggests strongly\nthat more specific and robust remedies would be feasible were Plaintiffs to prevail at trial.\nPlaintiffs highlight generally the uncertainty of litigation and the possibility that\nthey will not prevail either on a class certification motion or at trial.  The intervenors and the\nCity Defendants do not meaningfully contest this point, but argue that these factors do not\novercome the significant problems with the settlement process and the Consent Decree itself. \nPlaintiffs would still, in any event, be required to establish liability and the propriety of class\naction proceedings as against the City Defendants.  Thus, although the risks of proceeding\nagainst two groups of defendants is greater than proceeding against only one, the Court\nconcludes that this factor does not weigh strongly either for or against approval of the settlement.\nSummary\nAs discussed above, the Consent Decree is not entitled to a presumption of\nfairness.  The Grinnell factors generally weigh against approval of the settlement, or are\nrelatively neutral.  The failure of the Consent Decree to identify concrete issues, much less\nremedial measures and goals; the proponents’ failure to demonstrate that the parties had the\nrequisite understanding of the facts and the strengths and weaknesses of the Plaintiffs’ claims of\nlegal noncompliance by the State; and the extraordinary length of time for which the parties\npropose to bar further systemic litigation all render the Consent Decree patently unfair and\nMOTAPPROVESETTLEMENT.WPD VERSION AUGUST 12, 2016 20\n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273-LTS-HBP   Document 259   Filed 08/12/16   Page 21 of 21\nunreasonable as a settlement of Plaintiffs’ claims against the State Defendants.\nThe motion for final approval of the Consent Decree is therefore denied and the\nconditional certification of the Plaintiff class is vacated.9\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs’ motion for approval of the proposed Consent Decree is denied and the\nconditional certification of the Plaintiff class is vacated.

Foster care is supposed to be safe and temporary.  For children in New York \nCity’s foster care system, it is neither.  Children in New York City’s foster care system are in one \nof the most dangerous foster care systems in the country, and they spend longer in foster care \nthan do foster children almost anywhere else in the country.  The emotional damage—and, far \ntoo often, abuse—suffered by these children at the hands of a system designed to keep them safe \nis unacceptable.  That the responsible state and city officials have known about these problems \nand done nothing to fix them is inexcusable. \n2.  Ten named plaintiffs, all children in foster care in New York City, bring this \nlawsuit as a civil rights action on behalf of all children who are now or will be in the foster care \ncustody of the Commissioner of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services \n(“ACS”) (“Plaintiff Children”).  They seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against the city \nand state agencies and officials responsible for violating their rights under the United States \nConstitution, federal law, and New York state law and regulations.  Plaintiff Letitia James, as \nPublic Advocate for the City of New York, who has received myriad constituent complaints \nconcerning foster care, brings this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the \nCity Defendants to ensure that ACS promptly remedies the systemic failures that have been \nplaguing New York City’s foster care system for too long.   \n3.  Defendants are the City of New York (“City”), ACS, Gladys Carrión, \nCommissioner of ACS, in her official capacity (collectively, “City Defendants”); the State of \nNew York, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”), and Sheila J. \nPoole, Acting Commissioner of OCFS, in her official capacity (collectively, “State Defendants”). \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 5 of 111\n4.  Through a pattern and practice of long-standing and well-documented action and \ninaction, Defendants—who are responsible for protecting New York City’s foster children—fail \nto keep these children safe.  And, instead of ensuring that New York City’s foster children grow \nup in safe, permanent families, Defendants’ policies and customs cause far too many children to \ngrow up in the custody of the state, without a home or family to call their own: \na.  New York City children make up the majority of children in foster care in \nNew York State, which has one of the worst rates of maltreatment in foster \ncare of any jurisdiction in this country. \nb.  Children in foster care in New York City spend two times as much time in \nstate custody as children in the rest of New York State, and over double \nthe amount of time in state custody as children in the rest of the nation. \nc.  It takes longer to return New York City children in foster care to their \nparents than in the rest of New York State and the rest of the nation.  The \nmost recent federal data available shows that New York City performs \nworse on this measure than all but five other states and territories. \nd.  It takes longer for a foster child to be adopted in New York City than \nanywhere else in the country.  New York City has performed worse on this \nmeasure than every state since at least 2007.   \ne.  Many children who are without a permanent home never get adopted at all \nand leave the foster care system only when they get too old to stay in it \nany longer.  Approximately 1,000 children “age out” of the foster care \nsystem each year, often winding up homeless and without any adult with \nwhom they have a permanent connection.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 6 of 111\n5.  New York City’s child welfare system is causing devastating, ongoing and long-\nlasting harm to New York City children in its care:  \na.  Children who are separated from their parents to whom they could be \nreturned weep at the end of visits with their parents but continue to live in \nfoster care well beyond the time they could be returned home.   \nb.  Parents whose children are removed because they need services are unable \nto gain access to the right services and thus are unable to regain custody of \ntheir children. \nc.  Children who cannot be safely returned to their parents languish in foster \ncare, many moving from place to place, growing older and more damaged \nby their experiences, not knowing to which adults to form attachments, or \ntrusting no adults at all. \nd.  Children traumatized by the disruptions in their young lives do not know \nwhere they will be living from one month to the next, or whether there are \nany adults on whom they can rely.  Often by the time a decision is made \nabout what the plan should be for their future, they are irreparably \ndamaged by their experiences in foster care. \n6.  These consequences are the result of systemic deficiencies in which: \na.  The state agency, OCFS, is responsible for foster care across New York \nState and for ensuring that federal foster care funds are spent as required \nby the governing federal statutes and state statutes and regulations \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 7 of 111\nconsistent with federal law, but neither monitors nor enforces those laws \nand regulations. \nb.  The city agency, ACS, in whose legal custody all foster children are \nplaced, delegates its responsibility for the day-to-day care of these \nchildren by contract to 29 agencies (the “Contract Agencies”), paying \nhundreds of millions of dollars to the Contract Agencies for foster care \nservices but failing to ensure they meet minimum professional standards \nor provide adequate and meaningful oversight to ensure compliance with \nfederal and state law and the applicable contracts. \nc.  The damage that is being done to children in foster care in New York City \nas a direct result of these structural failures in the New York City child \nwelfare system is both avoidable and a violation of these children’s \nstatutory and constitutional rights.   \n7.  The illegal conduct of which Plaintiffs complain has plagued New York City’s \nfoster care system for far too long—a fact well known to Defendants, all of whom have been in a \nposition to change it.  \n8.  Plaintiffs seek a ruling from this Court that the structural deficiencies and long-\nstanding actions and inactions described in this complaint violate the statutory and constitutional \nrights of all children dependent on the New York City foster care system for their safety, their \nwell-being and their futures.  They seek an equitable injunction against the responsible city and \nstate officials and agencies named as Defendants in this lawsuit, directing that appropriate relief \nbe granted so that New York City’s foster children are no longer irreparably harmed by the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 8 of 111\nsystem that is supposed to protect them.  These children have a right to a safe and nurturing \nchildhood.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to protect that right. \nPARTIES \nI.  The Named Plaintiff Children  \nElisa W. \n9.  Plaintiff Elisa W. is a 16 year old girl in the twelfth grade.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother when she was approximately four years old.  She has been in ACS \ncustody for the past 12 years—over two thirds of her life.  \n10.  Plaintiff Elisa W. appears through her next friend, Elizabeth Barricelli.  Ms. \nBarricelli has been an elementary school teacher for over 30 years and currently teaches \nelementary school science at a public school in Brooklyn.  Ms. Barricelli taught Elisa W. from \n2006 to 2010 when Elisa W. was in elementary school and they recently reconnected.  Ms. \nBarricelli is familiar with Elisa W.’s background and education.  Ms. Barricelli is truly dedicated \nto Elisa W.’s best interests. \n11.  ACS removed Plaintiff Elisa W. from her biological mother when she was four \nyears old because of allegations of physical abuse.  At the time, Elisa W.’s biological mother was \napproximately 19 years old and living in a mother-child foster placement in New York City.   \n12.  Over the past 12 years, ACS has shuffled Plaintiff Elisa W. through so many \nfoster placements that she is unable to account for all of them—a direct result of ACS’s failure to \nensure an appropriate foster placement that could meet her needs.  In the last two years alone, \nElisa W. has been in four foster placements.  Elisa W. has attended at least seven schools over \nthe course of her young life.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 9 of 111\n13.  Plaintiff Elisa W. has a reported history of physical and suspected sexual abuse \nwhile in ACS custody. \n14.  In the first foster placement Plaintiff Elisa W. can remember, she was sexually \nabused by the nephew of her then-foster mother.  She was just six years old at the time.  She did \nnot report the incident to anyone because she did not want to get in trouble.  At this same \nplacement, Elisa W. was subjected to other physical, psychological and emotional abuse, \nincluding being forced by her then-foster mother to sleep in a bug-infested bedroom and being \nforced to walk around the foster home naked after bathing.  Once, Plaintiff Elisa W.’s then-foster \nmother beat her and denied her food as punishment for purportedly telling her biological mother \nthat she was being beaten by her foster mother; however, the allegation had been made by the \nfoster mother’s own daughter pretending to be Elisa W.  Upon information and belief, Elisa W.’s \nthen-foster mother would allow family members with violent criminal records in the home.  Elisa \nW. reports feeling like “just a total stranger” in this foster placement.   \n15.  In approximately 2006, Elisa W. was placed in another foster placement, and \nagain suffered severe physical, psychological and emotional abuse, including sexual abuse by \nmultiple relatives of her then-foster mother.  Elisa W.’s teachers made multiple reports of \nphysical abuse to her caseworker, including when Elisa W.’s then-foster mother punched her in \nthe face.  Upon information and belief, neither the Contract Agency nor ACS took any action in \nresponse to these reports.  Her then-foster mother neglected Elisa W., who often went to school \nunkempt and underfed; her teacher at the time, her next friend Ms. Barricelli, often had to buy \nElisa W. snacks during the school day and maintained a clean uniform at school for her.  Plaintiff \nElisa W. remained in this abusive foster placement for five years—a direct result of ACS’s \nfailure to ensure that the Contract Agency to which ACS had delegated day-to-day care of this \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 10 of 111\nyoung girl was keeping her safe.  On April 28, 2014, Plaintiff Elisa W. was assigned to a \ndifferent Contract Agency when it was determined she needed “therapeutic foster placements”.  \nAlthough Plaintiff Elisa W. is from New York City, the Contract Agency first placed her in a \nhome in Suffolk County and then in a home in Nassau County.  However, at the time—and to \nthis day—the only person Elisa W. considers a friend lives in New York City.        \n16.  As a result of the great emotional damage Elisa W. has suffered while in ACS \ncustody for the past 12 years, this young girl has suffered and continues to suffer from a variety \nof mental health problems.  Her diagnoses include depression, bipolar disorder and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.  She has been on anti-depressants and mood stabilizers since she was \n11 years old.  In July 2014, Elisa W. requested she be placed in a mental health facility because \nof her mental health concerns.  Elisa W. remained there for two months.  Since her \nhospitalization, she has been placed on heavy doses of psychotropic medication; she reports that, \nas a result, she can barely string a sentence together and no longer looks people in the eye \nbecause she gets nervous. \n17.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Elisa W. free from physical, psychological \nand emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate \nsteps consistent with professional standards to place Elisa W. in a permanent home.  Twice, \nPlaintiff Elisa W.’s biological mother conditionally surrendered her parental rights so Elisa W. \ncould be adopted.  Neither adoption was ever finalized.  In approximately 2010, Plaintiff Elisa \nW.’s aunt expressed interest in adopting Elisa W.  This adoption was not finalized.  In 2012, \nafter Plaintiff Elisa W. already had been in foster care for approximately eight years, her \nbiological mother’s parental rights were terminated.  Although her aunt has been considered as \nan adoptive resource since then, the Contract Agency, ACS and Plaintiff Elisa W.’s law guardian \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 11 of 111\nhave not taken steps to pursue this possibility or sought out other non-relative adoption \npossibilities for Plaintiff Elisa W. to finally have a permanent home and family to call her own.  \nIndeed, Elisa W. fears that she will “age out” of foster care—where she has spent the last 12 \nyears being abused, neglected and shuffled from place to place—and return to living with her \nbiological mother.  Elisa W. fears that if this happens she will be unable to attend college. \n18.  Plaintiff Elisa W. describes her stay in foster care by noting that when she was \nyounger she did well in school and had an extensive vocabulary, but now, as a result of her \nexperiences in foster care and medication regimen, she has difficulty concentrating.  She \nexpresses great frustration that the Contract Agency and ACS are unresponsive to her requests \nfor driving lessons and a state identification card—normal requests for a 16 year old girl.  For the \n12 years Elisa W. has been in foster care, the Contract Agency, ACS and Plaintiff Elisa W.’s law \nguardian have been making decisions about her life but, as she puts it—“no one ever asks me \nwhat I want”.  \n19.  During the 12 years that Plaintiff Elisa W. has been in the custody of ACS, \nDefendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by failing \nto protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has \ndelegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child. As a direct \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Elisa W. has suffered and continues to suffer \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 12 of 111\nirreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Elisa W. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment. \nAlexandria R. \n20.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. is a 12 year old girl in the fifth grade.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother’s home on August 9, 2007.  Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s permanency \ngoal currently is to be returned to her parent.  She has been in the custody of ACS for the past \neight years—over two thirds of her life.   \n21.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. appears through her next friend, Alison Max Rothschild.  \nMs. Rothschild is the director of a private school in New York City.  Ms. Rothschild knows \nAlexandria R. and her current foster parents, and is familiar with her background including her \neducation.  Ms. Rothschild is truly dedicated to Alexandria R.’s best interests.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, this is Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s second time in foster \ncare.  Upon information and belief, ACS removed her from her biological mother a few months \nafter she was born, placed her in a kinship foster placement with her maternal great-grandmother \nfor three and a half years and returned her to her biological mother for a few months—only to \nremove her and again place her in foster care in 2007.   \n23.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. is not the only child that ACS has removed from her \nbiological mother and placed into foster care.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. has six siblings:  (1) a 15 \nyear old sister, Andrea R.; (2) a 13 year old brother, Kavon L.; (3) an 11 year old brother, Russell \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 13 of 111\nW.; (4) a nine year old brother, Anton W.; (5) a seven year old sister, Naomi M.W.; and (6) a 20 \nmonth old sister, Raquel W.  All of her siblings are currently in foster care. \n24.  In 2006, ACS opened a preventive services case involving Plaintiff Alexandria \nR.’s biological mother because then six year old Andrea R. had jumped out of a second floor \nwindow after being locked in her bedroom.  In August 2007, ACS removed Plaintiff Alexandria \nR. and her then-living siblings from their home and placed them in ACS custody because their \nbiological mother’s boyfriend was physically abusing Alexandria R.’s brother, Kavon L.  Now \nseven year old Naomi M.W. was born five months later and ACS took custody of her at birth.  \nOn or about May 13, 2015, ACS removed Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s youngest sister, 22 month old \nRaquel W., from their biological mother due to allegations of neglect. \n25.  From 2007 to 2011, between the time she was four and eight years old, ACS \nbounced Plaintiff Alexandria R. from placement to placement due to its failure to ensure an \nappropriate foster placement that could meet her needs.  During her first four years in ACS \ncustody, ACS placed Plaintiff Alexandria R. in approximately eight different foster homes and \nwith two different Contract Agencies.  When she was approximately eight years old, Plaintiff \nAlexandria R. spent approximately six months in the mental health unit of a residential treatment \nfacility.  Her then-foster parents dropped her off, telling her they would return the next morning \nto pick her up, and never returned.  As a result, Plaintiff Alexandria R. suffered severe emotional \ntrauma, compounding the emotional harm she was already experiencing from being moved from \nplace to place. \n26.  ACS moved Plaintiff Alexandria R. to her current foster placement on November \n11, 2011, when she was eight years old.  She has now lived there for over three and a half years.  \nAt 12 years old, this is the longest she has ever lived in one place—a direct result of ACS’s \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 14 of 111\nfailure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and provide appropriate services \nconsistent with professional standards to enable this young girl to be safely returned to her \nbiological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to ensure that \nshe can grow up in a permanent family. \n27.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. has a reported history of physical and suspected sexual \nabuse.  Upon information and belief, the physical and suspected sexual abuse has taken place \nwhile Plaintiff Alexandria R. has been in ACS custody, and includes  physical abuse by her \nbiological mother during an unsupervised visit at her then-foster home. \n28.  As a result of the great emotional damage Alexandria R. has suffered while in \nACS custody for the past eight years, this young girl has suffered and continues to suffer from a \nvariety of mental health problems.  Her diagnoses over the past eight years have only grown \nmore serious during her time in foster care and have included adjustment disorder (2007), \nadjustment disorder with mixed disturbance emotions and conduct (i.e., mood and behavioral \nproblems) (2009), disorder of childhood (2009) and post-traumatic stress disorder (2014 to \npresent).  She also suffers from learning disabilities and is behind her peers in school. \n29.  Since being placed in ACS custody, Plaintiff Alexandria R. has suffered severe \nemotional and behavioral problems, including physical aggression toward herself and others.  \nShe has an extreme distrust of people she views as “in the system”, including her doctors and \ntherapists.  She also has difficulty controlling her emotions.  As recently as late 2014, Plaintiff \nAlexandria R. became highly emotional and distraught, including hysterically crying and \nbecoming physically aggressive, when her biological mother missed a family therapy \nappointment. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 15 of 111\n30.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Alexandria R. free from physical, \npsychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable \nand appropriate steps consistent with professional standards to place Alexandria R. in a \npermanent home.  In approximately 2012, after she already had been in foster care for over four \nyears, Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s permanency goal was changed to adoption and the Contract \nAgency to which ACS has delegated day-to-day responsibility for this child told this nine year \nold girl that she would be adopted by her foster parents.  However, the adoption did not take \nplace, even though her foster parents remain interested in adopting her, and this has created \nserious additional damage to Alexandria R.’s emotional state.  She is now angry and does not \nunderstand why her foster parents have not been able to adopt her yet. \n31.  In July 2013, Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s permanency goal was changed from \nadoption to return to parent.  Upon information and belief, this is because ACS attorneys failed \nto take necessary steps to obtain the termination of her biological mother’s parental rights.  \n32.  After already languishing in foster care for almost eight years, and with none of \nher siblings currently living with her or her biological mother, Plaintiff Alexandria R.’s \npermanency goal currently is to be returned to her parent.  Plaintiff Alexandria R. reportedly \nlives in fear that she will be moved yet again by ACS and has been deeply harmed by the \ncontinuing uncertainty about where and how she will grow up.   \n33.  During the almost eight years that Plaintiff Alexandria R. has been in the custody \nof ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights \nby failing to protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 16 of 111\nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Alexandria \nR. has suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the \nlasting emotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of \nnot knowing where she will grow up and of believing that there is no family she can call her \nown.  Because of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Alexandria R. is being deprived of \nthe opportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the \nopportunity for stability and healthy development. \nThierry E. \n34.  Plaintiff Thierry E. is a three year old boy.  ACS removed him from his biological \nmother on September 27, 2013.  His permanency goal currently is to be returned to his parent.  \nHe has been in ACS custody for the past 21 months—nearly half his life.  \n35.  Plaintiff Thierry E. appears through his next friend, Amy Mulzer.  Ms. Mulzer is \nan Acting Assistant Professor of Lawyering at New York University School of Law.  The \nprimary focus of her research includes:  Adoption, Child Welfare, Family Law, Parental Rights \nand Poverty Law.  Prior to joining the lawyering faculty at NYU, Ms. Mulzer spent five years \nrepresenting low-income parents whose children were in foster care or at risk of being placed in \nfoster care, first as a staff attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services and then as an appellate \nattorney on the assigned counsel panel for the Appellate Division, Second Department.  Ms. \nMulzer is truly dedicated to Thierry E.’s best interests.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 17 of 111\n36.  On or about August 15, 2013, Thierry E.’s mother, who has been a public school \nteacher for the past 11 years, called Safe Horizon, a domestic violence hotline, to request \ninformation about how she could remove Thierry E.’s biological father from her home.  Safe \nHorizon reported the call to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment and \nACS opened an investigation.  There was not and never has been any allegation that anyone \nabused Thierry E. or that his mother failed to provide him with appropriate, loving care.  On \nSeptember 23, 2013, Thierry E.’s mother obtained an order of protection from the Family Court \nagainst Thierry E.’s father.  In her petition, she alleged that Thierry E.’s father had held a knife to \nher throat threatening to kill her, strangled her at least three times, punched her in the face and \nthrew household furniture at her.  Thierry E.’s mother has not been in a relationship with Thierry \nE.’s father since September 2013 and does not intend to re-enter a relationship with him. \n37.  ACS removed Plaintiff Thierry E. from his home on September 27, 2013, while \nhis mother was at work, without taking necessary steps or making reasonable efforts to \ndetermine whether Thierry E. could remain safely at home with his mother.  His father was no \nlonger living in the house. \n38.  The Contract Agency to which ACS had delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Thierry E. first moved him to a foster placement far \naway from his mother’s home and required visits to take place at the Contract Agency’s office in \nthe Bronx, even though he and his mother had lived in Manhattan.  Moreover, the foster mother \nspoke only Spanish and Thierry E., then two years old, did not speak any Spanish.  As a result, \nThierry E.’s language and speech development was severely stunted.  Thierry E.’s mother had \nhim evaluated in March 2014 and the speech therapist recommended speech therapy twice a \nweek, but the Contract Agency refused to provide this service.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 18 of 111\n39.  On May 13, 2014, during a visit at the Contract Agency, Plaintiff Thierry E.’s \nmother noticed a severe rash while changing his diaper and reported this and other concerns to \nthe Family Court.  On June 21, 2014, the Family Court ordered that Thierry E. be transferred to a \nnew Contract Agency.  Thierry E. was moved to a second foster placement two days later.  \n40.  Plaintiff Thierry E. has now been in foster care for 21 months—nearly half his \nlife.  This is a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan \nand provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy \nto be returned to his mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to \nensure that he would grow up in a permanent family.   \n41.  Plaintiff Thierry E. has suffered emotional harm as a result of spending nearly \nhalf his life in ACS custody without a permanent family.  All indications are that he misses his \nmother very much.  At the end of his twice weekly visits with his mother, he cries \nuncontrollably.  When his mother expressed concern at this behavior, Thierry E.’s therapist told \nher that he had to “get used to it” because this was “his life now”. \n42.  ACS continues to fail to ensure that Plaintiff Thierry E. is receiving appropriate \nservices.  Although Thierry E. currently receives therapy, Thierry E.’s mother has expressed \nconcerns that the therapy being provided by the Contract Agency is focused on normalizing \nThierry E.’s separation from his mother rather than trying to help him prepare to be returned to \nher care—even though his permanency goal remains to be returned to his parent.  \n43.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Thierry E. free from emotional harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nprofessional standards to place Thierry E. in a permanent home.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 19 of 111\n44.  Although ACS removed Plaintiff Thierry E. from his home over 20 months ago, \nthere has been no fact-finding hearing or disposition of ACS’s neglect petition against Thierry \nE.’s biological mother.  The fact-finding hearing has been postponed several times. \n45.  Plaintiff Thierry E. had his first permanency hearing in December 2014—after he \nhad already been in ACS custody for over a year. \n46.  Plaintiff Thierry E.’s permanency goal remains to be returned to his parent.  His \nbiological mother wants nothing more than to finally bring her son home.  She has completed \nparenting classes, domestic violence counseling and mental health evaluations in accordance \nwith the two different Contract Agencies’ instructions.  In documents filed with the Family \nCourt, the Contract Agency has stated that Thierry E.’s mother “comes prepared to her visits \nwith activities to do with her son and also tries to reinforce parenting skills that will help her \nson’s vocabulary and pronunciation.”   \n47.  Since his removal over 21 months ago, ACS has made no effort to ensure that this \nlittle boy is returned to the mother he misses, and that his permanency goal—reunification with \nhis biological mother—is implemented as soon as possible.   \n48.  During the nearly two years that Plaintiff Thierry E. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision of \nappropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his mother or, if that were not \npossible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a permanent home.  ACS has further \nfailed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 20 of 111\nhas delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  As a direct \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Thierry E. has suffered and continues to suffer \nirreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where he will grow up \nand of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  Because of Defendants’ actions and \ninactions, Plaintiff Thierry E. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment. \nAyanna J. \n49.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. is a two and a half year old girl.  ACS removed her from her \nbiological mother on November 2, 2012—three days after she was born.  Her permanency goal \ncurrently is adoption.  She has been in ACS custody for the past two and a half years—virtually \nher entire life. \n50.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. appears through her next friend, Meyghan McCrea.  Meyghan \nMcCrea is an attorney in private practice in New York City.  She was previously employed as a \nFamily Court Legal Services Attorney for ACS.  Ms. McCrea has known Ayanna J. since March \n2013 and has had regular contact with her since that time.  Ms. McCrea has met Ayanna J.’s \ncurrent foster parent and babysitter.  Ms. McCrea is truly dedicated to Ayanna J.’s best interests.  \n51.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. has two siblings:  (1) a nine year old sister, Alyssa L., and (2) \na sister, Angela L., who was beaten to death by her biological mother’s boyfriend in March 2010, \nwhen she was 19 months old.  Documents filed with the Family Court allege that, given Angela \nL.’s extensive injuries, Plaintiff’s biological mother knew or should have known about the \nongoing abuse that her daughter suffered.  These documents also allege that Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 21 of 111\nbiological mother delayed seeking medical care for Angela L., lied to hospital staff about the \nsource of the child’s injuries and instructed her other daughter, Alyssa L., who was then three \nand a half years old, to lie about what had occurred. \n52.  The day after Angela L. died, ACS filed a petition against Ayanna J.’s biological \nmother alleging severe and repeated abuse.  In October 2012, the Family Court made a finding of \nabuse against Ayanna J.’s biological mother.  On appeal in June 2014, the New York State \nAppellate Division found that Ayanna J.’s biological mother “severely abused [Angela L.] and \nderivatively severely abused the subject child [Alyssa L.]”. \n53.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. was born after her sister Angela L. died.  Due to the prior \nfinding of abuse against her biological mother, ACS placed Plaintiff Ayanna J. in custody and in \nher current foster placement on November 2, 2012—three days after she was born.  In March \n2013, the Family Court made a finding of derivative abuse as to Ayanna J. and on September 30, \n2014, the Family Court amended its finding to severe abuse as to Ayanna J. based on the \nAppellate Division’s June 2014 finding. \n54.  Since being placed in foster care two and a half years ago, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has \nhad approximately eight caseworkers at the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated her \nday-to-day care.   \n55.  While in the custody of ACS, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has had supervised visits with \nher biological mother and father at the Contract Agency.  During one such visit in September \n2013, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s biological father became angry and began screaming at Ayanna J.’s \nbiological mother in front of Ayanna J., who was not even two years old at the time.  Upon \ninformation and belief, at least one Contract Agency visit was discontinued because Ayanna J.’s \nbiological parents were fighting.  Ayanna J.’s biological father has not visited Plaintiff Ayanna J. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 22 of 111\nsince April 2014.  Upon information and belief, visits at Ayanna J.’s biological mother’s home \nwere suspended after she threatened to physically assault a caseworker.  Ayanna J. continues to \nhave supervised visits with her biological mother twice per week at the Contract Agency.  \nDuring one such visit in July 2014, Ayanna J.’s biological mother allowed her biological father \nto speak with Plaintiff Ayanna J. over the phone despite such contact being prohibited. \n56.  Plaintiff Ayanna J. has languished in the custody of ACS for the past two and a \nhalf years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan \nand provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young girl \nto be safely returned to her mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of \ntime, to ensure that she can grow up in a permanent family. \n57.  As a result of her continued placement in ACS custody, Plaintiff Ayanna J. has \nsuffered great emotional harm.  In 2013, Ayanna J. cried hysterically during supervised visits \nwith her biological mother at the Contract Agency.  Now that she is older, Ayanna J. expresses \nthe desire to not attend visits with her biological mother, will not leave her babysitter to visit \nwith her biological mother, or will ask for her babysitter in the middle of a visit with her \nbiological mother.  These visits have caused and continue to cause great stress, confusion and \npsychological harm to this young child.  \n58.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Ayanna J. free from emotional harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nreasonable professional standards to place Ayanna J. in a permanent home.   \n59.  On April 9, 2014, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s permanency goal was changed from return \nto parent to adoption.  Her current foster parent has indicated a willingness to adopt her.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 23 of 111\n60.  A petition for termination of parental rights (“TPR”) was filed on April 28, 2014, \nafter Plaintiff Ayanna J. already had been in foster care for almost one and a half years.  The \nTPR proceedings were adjourned repeatedly due to ACS’s failure to ensure that all parties were \nprepared for court on scheduled hearing dates to resolve the permanency issues in this case.  On \nApril 27, 2015, almost a year after the TPR petition was filed, the assigned New York Family \nCourt judge heard one day of testimony related to the TPR proceeding and continued the case \nuntil mid-June 2015.  The next day, that Family Court judge was reassigned to another court.  On \nJune 22, 2015, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s TPR proceeding was re-assigned to a new New York Family \nCourt judge, who declared a mistrial and postponed a new trial until October 2015. \n61.  After languishing in foster care for two and a half years, Plaintiff Ayanna J.’s \npermanency goal remains to be adopted.   \n62.  During the two and a half years that Plaintiff Ayanna J.  has been in the custody \nof ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights \nby failing to protect her from psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to \nwhich ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  \nAs a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Ayanna J. has suffered and continues to \nsuffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 24 of 111\nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Ayanna J. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment.  \nOlivia R. and Ana-Maria R. \n63.  Plaintiff Olivia R. is a five year old girl in the first grade, and Plaintiff Ana-Maria \nR. is a four year old girl in pre-kindergarten.  ACS removed them from their biological mother’s \nhome on June 8, 2011.  The permanency goal for both children currently is adoption.  They have \nbeen in ACS custody for more than four years.  \n64.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. appear through their next friend, Dawn Cardi.  \nMs. Cardi is an attorney in private practice in New York City, specializing in criminal and family \nlaw.  She is appointed and has served as a certified Law Guardian in the First Department of the \nAppellate Division, representing children in complex family law proceedings.  She is truly \ndedicated to Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s best interests. \n65.  Upon information and belief, this is Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s second \ntime in ACS custody.  Upon information and belief, ACS removed Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-\nMaria R. from their biological parents in January 2011, they spent a few months in a foster \nplacement and then ACS returned them home.  On June 8, 2011, when Olivia R. was two years \nold and Ana-Maria R. was eight months old, ACS again removed the girls from their home and \nplaced them into ACS custody, reportedly due to domestic violence between their biological \nparents and their biological mother’s alcohol and drug use.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 25 of 111\n66.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. initially placed them in a non-\nkinship foster placement—the third place they had been moved to in six months.   \n67.  In March 2012, the Contract Agency returned Olivia and Ana-Maria R. to their \nbiological mother on a trial discharge.  In June 2012, their biological mother dropped them off at \nthe foster home where they had been living and did not return to pick them up.  She did not visit \nthe children again until July 24, 2012. \n68.  ACS has allowed Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. to be bounced in and out of \nfoster care for almost the entirety of their young lives, and they now have been in ACS custody \nfor the past four years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate \ncase plan and provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable these \nyoung girls to be safely returned to their biological mother or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, to ensure that they can grow up in a permanent family. \n69.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered physical and emotional abuse \nwhile in ACS custody.  In October 2013, Plaintiff Olivia R., who was four years old at the time, \nwas sexually abused by her biological mother’s friend during an unsupervised visit.  Plaintiff \nAna-Maria R. was present during that abuse.  Although the Contract Agency was made aware of \nthis abuse at that time, upon information and belief, neither the Contract Agency nor ACS took \nany action in response to the report.  More recently, Plaintiff Olivia R. reported the incident to \nher therapist, who (as a mandated reporter) informed the Statewide Central Register of Child \nAbuse and Maltreatment and the police, and an investigation is underway.  Plaintiffs Olivia and \nAna-Maria R.’s biological mother has not visited with the children since November 26, 2014. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 26 of 111\n70.  As a result of the emotional harm they have suffered while in ACS custody for the \npast four years, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered and continue to suffer from a \nvariety of mental health problems.  Olivia R.’s diagnoses include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder, Developmental Coordination Disorder and Disruptive Behavior Disorder.  She is in a \nspecial education setting at school.  Ana-Maria R.’s diagnoses include Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder, Anger Management, and Conduct Disorder.  She is being evaluated for \nplacement in a special education setting at school.    \n71.  Since being placed in ACS custody, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have \nsuffered severe emotional and behavioral problems.  Olivia R. has developed serious trust issues \nand she wets the bed before any visit with her biological mother.  Ana-Maria R. demonstrates \nsevere hyperactivity and aggression.  At school, she often would hit her teacher, tear things off \nthe wall or break other items.  In January 2015, her pre-kindergarten program would not allow \nher to attend classes until she was medicated for these behavioral problems.  She did not start \nreceiving medication until June 2015. \n72.  ACS has failed to ensure that Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. are provided \nwith the necessary and appropriate services to ensure their physical, psychological and emotional \nwell-being.  One of their caseworkers recommended that the girls enroll in Bridges to Health \nProgram (“B2H”)—a Medicaid waiver program that provides support for children in foster care \nwho are medically fragile, have a developmental disability or are severely emotionally disturbed.  \nUpon information and belief, when their foster mother initially requested these services, the \nContract Agency declined to submit the request because an agency caseworker said “that’s a lot \nof paperwork”.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. still do not \nhave B2H services. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 27 of 111\n73.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. free from \nphysical, psychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS also has failed to take \nreasonable and appropriate steps consistent with reasonable professional standards to place \nPlaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. in a permanent home.   \n74.  Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s permanency goal was not changed from \nreturn to parent to adoption until March 1, 2014—after they had been in ACS custody for almost \nthree years.  Olivia and Ana-Maria R.’s current foster mother has indicated a willingness to \nadopt them.  TPR petitions were filed approximately eight months later in November 2014.  \nUpon information and belief, on May 28, 2015, the judge made an oral statement that parental \nrights would be terminated; however, because none of the attorneys present had drafted a \nproposed order, that ruling has not been finalized and Olivia and Ana-Maria R. are not yet freed \nfor adoption. \n75.  During the four years that Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have been in the \ncustody of ACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated their constitutional, statutory and \ncontractual rights by failing to protect them from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by \nfailing to provide services to ensure their physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by \nfailing to ensure the provision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional \nstandards or of a meaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable them to be safely returned to \ntheir biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place \nthem in a permanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful \noversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, these children.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and \ninactions, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 28 of 111\nharm and continue to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a consequence of \nchildren being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where they will grow up and of \nbelieving that there is no family they can call their own.  Because of Defendants’ actions and \ninactions, Plaintiffs Olivia and Ana-Maria R. are being deprived of the opportunity for a \nchildhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and \nhealthy development.  \nXavion M. \n76.  Plaintiff Xavion M. is a five year old boy in the first grade.  ACS removed him \nfrom his biological mother due to an allegation of neglect 15 days after he was born.  Plaintiff \nXavion M.’s permanency goal currently is adoption.  He has been in ACS custody for over five \nyears—nearly his entire life. \n77.  Plaintiff Xavion M. appears through his next friend, Michael B. Mushlin.  Mr. \nMushlin is a Law Professor at Pace University School of Law in New York City, where he has \ntaught for the last 30 years.  His scholarship has included maltreatment of children in foster care.  \nPreviously, he worked as a public interest and civil rights lawyer for 15 years as a staff attorney \nwith Harlem Assertion of Rights, Inc., as a staff attorney and Project Director of the Prisoners \nRights Project of the Legal Aid Society, and as Associate Director of the Children’s Rights \nProject of the American Civil Liberties Union.  He is truly dedicated to Xavion M.’s best \ninterests. \n78.  Plaintiff Xavion M. is not the only child that ACS has removed from his \nbiological mother and placed into foster care.   Plaintiff Xavion M. has two siblings:  (1) a 12 \nyear old brother, Vincent D., and (2) an 11 year old sister, Zahara D.  Plaintiff Xavion M.’s \nsiblings have been in ACS custody for the past six years.  Upon information and belief, at least \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 29 of 111\none Family Court judge has referred to these two children as “unadoptable” and their \npermanency goals remain that they be returned to their parent.  \n79.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young boy first placed Plaintiff Xavion M. with a fictive kin \nfoster parent, who was a friend of his biological mother.  On December 21, 2011, when Xavion \nM. was just two years old, he was moved to a second, non-kinship, foster placement.  When he \narrived, he was anemic and malnourished.  He has resided in this foster placement for well over \nthree years—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan \nand provide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy \nto be safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable \nperiod of time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n80.  Since being placed in foster care over five years ago, Plaintiff Xavion M. has had \napproximately four caseworkers at the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated his care and \ncase planning. \n81.  Plaintiff Xavion M., who has been in ACS custody for over five years, has weekly \nsupervised visits with his biological mother and older siblings.  Upon information and belief, \nPlaintiff Xavion M.’s brother hit and kicked him during a recent visit. \n82.  The Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, this boy has not provided Plaintiff Xavion M. with necessary \nservices for his physical and emotional well-being.  Although his teacher recommended that an \nIndividualized Education Program be written for him, Xavion M. has not received the evaluation \nnecessary because his biological mother refuses to give consent. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 30 of 111\n83.  As a result of the over five years that Plaintiff Xavion M. has spent in ACS \ncustody, Xavion M. has suffered severe emotional damage.  He has started to exhibit increased \nbehavioral problems, including becoming aggressive and violent at home and at school; he also \nis having difficulty concentrating at school. At five years old, he will only sleep in the same bed \nas his foster mother and will not sleep through the night.     \n84.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Xavion M. free from physical, \npsychological and emotional harm while in its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable \nand appropriate steps consistent with reasonable professional standards to place Xavion M. in a \npermanent home.   \n85.  On July 21, 2014—after Plaintiff Xavion M. had been in foster care for almost \nfive years—Xavion’s permanency goal was changed from return to parent to adoption.  This goal \nchange occurred only after the Family Court judge handling Xavion M. and his siblings’ case \ninstructed Xavion M.’s caseworkers at the Contract Agency to file a petition to terminate the \nparental rights of Xavion M.’s biological mother and begin adoption proceedings.  Xavion M.’s \ncurrent foster mother has indicated a willingness to adopt.  Almost a year later, no TPR petition \nhas been filed. \n86.  Despite the court’s instruction, the Contract Agency plans to return Xavion M. to \nhis biological mother after first returning Xavion M.’s older siblings to his mother on a trial \nbasis.  Indeed, papers filed in Family Court in March 2015 state that the “Agency is working \nwith [biological mother] for reunification”.  At a family team conference on June 24, 2015, the \nContract Agency said it will pursue granting Xavion M.’s biological mother unsupervised visits \ndespite the fact that Xavion M.’s therapist has stated that Xavion M. is not ready for this and that \nXavion M.’s permanency goal is adoption.  The long-standing inconsistency in planning for this \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 31 of 111\nchild’s future is increasing the insecurity and emotional damage this child is experiencing in \nfoster care. \n87.  During the over five years that Plaintiff Xavion M. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Xavion M. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Xavion M. is being deprived of the \nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development. \nDameon C. \n88.  Plaintiff Dameon C. is a four year old boy with special needs.  ACS removed him \nfrom his biological mother, who was then incarcerated, nine days after he was born.  His \npermanency goal currently is adoption.  He has been in ACS custody for over four years—nearly \nhis entire life. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 32 of 111\n89.  Plaintiff Dameon C. appears through his next friend, Reverend Doctor \nGwendolyn Hadley-Hall.  Reverend Doctor Hadley-Hall is an associate pastor at Christ Temple \nUnited Baptist Church in Brooklyn.  Prior to entering the ministry, Reverend Doctor Hadley-Hall \nwas a teacher at public elementary schools in New York City for 30 years.  She is truly dedicated \nto Dameon C.’s best interests. \n90.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this boy first placed Plaintiff Dameon C. in a foster placement. \n91.  On Christmas Eve 2011, when Plaintiff Dameon C. was nine months old, he was \nreturned to his mother on a trial basis when she was released from jail.  They were placed in a \nmother-child drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.  His former foster parent would often take \nDameon C. for two to three weeks at a time with his biological mother’s consent because \nDameon C.’s behavior deteriorated drastically when he was moved to his mother’s care.  He \nbegan banging his head, which he continues to do now at age four.  In July 2012, his biological \nmother was expelled from the rehabilitation center and Dameon C. was returned to his former \nfoster placement, where he remains to this day.  He has been in foster care virtually his entire \nlife—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and \nprovide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy to \nbe safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n92.  While in ACS custody, Plaintiff Dameon C. has had regular visits with his \nbiological mother.  In February 2014, when Dameon was almost three years old, his mother \nkicked him during the first unsupervised overnight visit at her drug treatment facility.  Although \nshe is still permitted to have supervised visits with him, she did not have contact with Dameon C. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 33 of 111\nbetween December 2014 and April 23, 2015, at which time she began attending supervised visits \nwith Dameon C. again.  However, in recent weeks, Dameon C.’s biological mother has \ndisappeared from her drug treatment program and has not attended visits with him or contacted \nhim since. \n93.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Dameon C. safe from physical abuse and \nemotional damage, ACS has also failed to ensure that he is provided with necessary services to \nensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being.  Although he has been diagnosed \nwith Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, he was placed \non the waiting list for B2H.   \n94.  ACS also has failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps to place Plaintiff \nDameon C. in a permanent home.  Dameon C.’s permanency goal was not changed to adoption \nuntil November 3, 2014—after he had already been in ACS custody for over three and a half \nyears.  A TPR petition was filed thereafter.  Plaintiff Dameon C.’s next court date had been \nscheduled for June 2, 2015, but has been postponed until November 2015.  \n95.  During the over four years that Plaintiff Dameon C. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 34 of 111\nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Dameon C. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Dameon C. is being deprived of the \nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development.  \nTyrone M. \n96.  Plaintiff Tyrone M. is a seven year old boy with special needs.  ACS removed \nhim from his biological mother 12 days after he was born.  His permanency goal currently is \nadoption.  He has been in ACS custody for over seven years—nearly his entire life. \n97.  Plaintiff Tyrone M. appears through his next friend, Bishop Lillian Robinson-\nWiltshire.  Bishop Robinson-Wiltshire is the Senior Pastor and Overseer of Cathedral of Christ \nCommunity Ministries in Brooklyn.  Prior to entering the ministry 30 years ago, Bishop \nRobinson-Wiltshire was a family counselor and worked with families dealing with abuse and \nneglect.  Bishop Robinson-Wiltshire has also served as a foster parent to older children.  She is \ntruly dedicated to Tyrone M.’s best interests. \n98.  Twelve days after he was born, ACS removed Plaintiff Tyrone M. from his \nbiological mother when she tested positive for cocaine after giving birth to him.   \n99.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young boy first placed Plaintiff Tyrone M. in a kinship foster \nplacement with his aunt.  On June 23, 2014, ACS removed him from his aunt’s home after she \nfailed a random drug screening.  The Contract Agency then placed him in a non-kinship foster \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 35 of 111\nplacement where he currently resides.  Plaintiff Tyrone M. has now spent his entire life in ACS \ncustody—a direct result of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and \nprovide appropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young boy to \nbe safely returned to his biological mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to ensure that he can grow up in a permanent family. \n100.  ACS also has also failed to keep Plaintiff Tyrone M. free from physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm while in its custody.  When he arrived at his current foster \nplacement, his health and behavior indicated severe neglect.  He suffered from severe dental \nproblems.  He went to sleep in his clothing every night because in his previous foster placement \nhe had not been provided with such basic care as being taught to undress or change into pajamas \nbefore bed.   \n101.  As a result of the emotional harm he has suffered while in ACS custody for the \npast seven years, Plaintiff Tyrone M. suffered and continues to suffer from a variety of mental \nhealth problems.  His diagnoses include Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Developmental \nCoordination Disorder, Communication Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  \nTyrone M. also exhibits severe behavioral problems and often becomes violent at school and \nthrows chairs or pencils.  As a result, his school has barred him from eating in the lunchroom \nwith other students and from attending school-sponsored field trips. \n102.  ACS has also failed to ensure that Plaintiff Tyrone M. is provided with the \nnecessary services to ensure his physical and emotional well-being.  For example, although his \nIndividualized Education Program states that he is required to receive psychological counseling \noutside of school, upon information and belief, it has taken the Contract Agency over a year to \neven begin the process for getting Tyrone M. mental health services. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 36 of 111\n103.  In addition to failing to keep Plaintiff Tyrone M. physically free from harm while \nin its custody, ACS has also failed to take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with \nreasonable professional standards to place Plaintiff Tyrone M. in a permanent home.   \n104.  After almost seven years in foster care, his biological mother recently voluntarily \nsurrendered her parental rights.  Although he is now free to be adopted, it is not clear that he will \nbe adopted by his current foster parent and, upon information and belief, the Contract Agency, \nACS and Plaintiff Tyrone M.’s law guardian have not sought out other adoption possibilities for \nPlaintiff Tyrone M. to have a permanent home and family to call his own. \n105.  During the over seven years that Plaintiff Tyrone M. has been in the custody of \nACS, Defendants repeatedly have violated his constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by \nfailing to protect him from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide \nservices to ensure his physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the \nprovision of appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a \nmeaningful, timely and appropriate plan to enable him to be safely returned to his biological \nmother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place him in a \npermanent home.  ACS has further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning \nresponsibility for, this child.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Tyrone M. \nhas suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting \nemotional damage that is a consequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not \nknowing where he will grow up and of believing that there is no family he can call his own.  \nBecause of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiff Tyrone M. is being deprived of the \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 37 of 111\nopportunity for a childhood that is reasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity \nfor stability and healthy development. \nBrittney W. \n106.  Plaintiff Brittney W. is a six year old girl with special needs.  ACS removed her \nfrom her biological mother and placed her into ACS custody on May 10, 2011.  Her permanency \ngoal currently is to be returned to her parent.  She has been in ACS custody for over four years—\nmost of her life. \n107.  Plaintiff Brittney W. appears through her next friend, Liza Camellerie.  Ms. \nCamellerie is an attorney in private practice in New York City.  She currently serves on the \nassigned panel for Family Court in Manhattan, representing children and parents in Article 10 \ncases, among others.  She also spent six years as a Family Court Legal Services (“FCLS”) \nAttorney for ACS, four of which were spent as a supervisor to 25 to 30 other FCLS attorneys.  \nMs. Camellerie is truly dedicated to Brittney W.’s best interests. \n108.  Shortly after Plaintiff Brittney W. was born, a report was called in to the \nStatewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment alleging that her biological \nmother’s own mental incapacity and developmental delays prevented her from caring for her \ninfant daughter.  Brittney W. was placed into voluntary kinship care with her biological mother’s \nniece by agreement with ACS. \n109.  On May 10, 2011, when Plaintiff Brittney W. was two years old, ACS remanded \nher into custody because her mother’s niece could no longer care for Brittney W. \n110.  The Contract Agency to which ACS delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, this young girl then placed Plaintiff Brittney W. in a non-kinship \nfoster placement.  She has been residing in this foster placement for over four years—a direct \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 38 of 111\nresult of ACS’s failure to develop and implement an appropriate case plan and provide \nappropriate services consistent with professional standards to enable this young girl to be safely \nreturned to her mother or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to ensure \nthat she can grow up in a permanent family. \n111.  After over four years in foster care, Plaintiff Brittney W.’s permanency goal is to \nbe returned to her parent.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff Brittney W.’s lawyer does not \nthink that her biological mother’s mental incapacities allow her to provide appropriate care for \nBrittney W.  Upon information and belief, the Contract Agency to which ACS has delegated the \ncare and case planning responsibility for this child has taken the position that Brittney W.’s \nbiological mother can provide care if she has 24-hour medical support.  Upon information and \nbelief, because Brittney’s W.’s doctor reports that there is no reason why 24-hour support is \nmedically necessary, the Contract Agency is trying to arrange for Brittany W.’s biological \nmother to have medical and other support during daytime hours.  Brittney W.’s current foster \nmother has indicated a willingness to adopt.  No TPR petition has been filed.  \n112.  During the four years that Plaintiff Brittney W. has been in the custody of ACS, \nDefendants repeatedly have violated her constitutional, statutory and contractual rights by failing \nto protect her from physical, psychological and emotional harm; by failing to provide services to \nensure her physical, psychological and emotional well-being; by failing to ensure the provision \nof appropriate foster care placements consistent with professional standards or of a meaningful, \ntimely and appropriate plan to enable her to be safely returned to her biological mother or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place her in a permanent home.  ACS \nhas further failed to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract Agencies to \nwhich ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, this child.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 39 of 111\nAs a direct result of defendants’ actions and inactions, Brittney W. has suffered and continues to \nsuffer irreparable harm and continues to be subjected to the lasting emotional damage that is a \nconsequence of a child being harmed while in foster care, of not knowing where she will grow \nup and of believing that there is no family she can call her own.  Because of Defendants’ actions \nand inactions, Plaintiff Brittney W. is being deprived of the opportunity for a childhood that is \nreasonably free from harm and that provides the opportunity for stability and healthy \ndevelopment. \n*** \n113.  All of Defendants’ actions and inactions as described herein substantially depart \nfrom accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of \nharms and violations of legal rights suffered by the Named Plaintiff Children. \nII.  The Public Advocate for the City of New York \n114.  Plaintiff Letitia James is the Public Advocate for the City of New York (the \n“Public Advocate”).  In this capacity, the Public Advocate ensures that the city government \nserves its citizens by exercising oversight of city agencies, investigating citizen complaints \nregarding city services, and making proposals or seeking relief to address perceived \nshortcomings or failures.  \n115.  Just two months into her tenure, the Public Advocate introduced a law, Int. 0104-\n2014, that would require ACS to report information related to youth in the foster care system on \nan annual basis.  This law ensures that the City monitors which supports and resources these \nyoung adults use and identifies ongoing educational barriers they experience and problems they \nmight encounter with homelessness or law enforcement.  In September 2014, the Office of the \nPublic Advocate issued a policy report concerning youth “aging out” of the foster care system.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 40 of 111\nThe report provided recommendations to improve data collection, access to housing, and \ncoordination of services for young people aging out of the system.  On September 30, 2014, Int. \n0104-2014 was signed into law. \n116.  On an ongoing basis, the Office of the Public Advocate Constituent Affairs \nDepartment (“the Constituent Affairs Department”) receives complaints from constituents in all \nfive boroughs alleging deficiencies and lapses in responsibilities by both ACS and Contract \nAgencies.  Constituent complaints alleged, for instance, failure to investigate allegations of abuse \nof children in ACS custody, failure to initiate timely TPR proceedings, failure to follow proper \nprocedures when removing children from their family home or foster home, failure to provide \nrequired services for both biological parents and foster children, failure to honor ACS vouchers \nand potentially retaliatory practices against those who complained directly to ACS or Contract \nAgencies.  In total, the Constituent Affairs Department has received 259 complaints regarding \nACS since January 1, 2014.  \n117.  As a result of ongoing complaints, the Public Advocate identified ACS as an \nagency whose practices warrant investigation.  \n118.  Upon learning that New York City keeps children in foster care longer than \nalmost every jurisdiction in the country, the Office of the Public Advocate began to examine \nobstacles to permanency and established a hotline to hear directly from foster children and their \nadvocates about their experiences. \n119.  In November 2014, the Office of the Public Advocate requested a copy of all \ncontracts ACS holds with individual Contract Agencies; on November 17, 2014, ACS responded \nwith electronic copies of all the contracts it has with the 29 Contract Agencies.  On or about \nFebruary 6, 2015, the Office requested all data collected by ACS used to produce “Scorecard” \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 41 of 111\nevaluations (see infra ¶¶ 214–17) of the Contract Agencies from 2012 to 2014, in addition to the \nScorecard evaluations themselves and any related documentation.  After receiving no response, \nthe Office of the Public Advocate repeated the request on February 27, 2015.  A meeting was \nheld on March 11, 2015, at which the document request was made for a third time and denied by \nACS.  \n120.  On or about April 1, 2015, the Office of the Public Advocate sent a letter to ACS \nthreatening legal action if they did not comply with the data request and also requested access to \nACS’s Legal Tracking System in order to investigate constituent complaints concerning \nsignificant delays and inefficiencies occurring in Family Court proceedings in which ACS is \ninvolved.  Following this correspondence, ACS provided Scorecard evaluations, but did not \nprovide the underlying data used to produce them, or the other requested information.   \n121.  Also in April 2015, the Office of the Public Advocate launched a multilingual \nhotline to learn first-hand from children and their advocates about the current barriers to \nreceiving better services while in foster care and obtaining a safe and permanent home.  \nParticipants in the hotline were asked to complete a survey.  The survey’s questions varied based \non the type of respondent—typically a child, birth parent or foster parent—and asked about the \nchild’s trajectory in foster care, permanency planning, services provided and cases of \nmaltreatment in care.  \n122.  Combining anecdotal reports from the hotline and publicly available data, the \nOffice of the Public Advocate identified several deficiencies including, but not limited to, ACS \nremoval of children without proper court process, failure to identify and provide adequate \nservices for parents of children in care and subsequent delays in reunification, failure to place \nchildren appropriately and thus creating instability, failure of ACS and the Contract Agencies to \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 42 of 111\nbe prepared for court dates, failure of ACS to recruit, train and support adoptive placements, \nfailure to engage in concurrent planning, failure to protect children from maltreatment and failure \nto provide adequate health and mental health services to children in care.  Those deficiencies and \nrecommendations for addressing them were cited in a report that was issued on July 2, 2015. \nIII.  Defendants \n123.  Defendant City of New York (“City”) was, and is, a municipal entity created and \nauthorized under the laws of the State of New York.  It is authorized by law to maintain and  \nultimately is responsible for the New York City Administration for Children’s Services, which \nacts as its agent in the area of protecting the safety and welfare of children in the City.  The City \nassumes the risks incidental to the maintenance of the New York City Administration for \nChildren’s Services and its employment of attorneys, caseworkers and others. \n124.  Defendant New York City Administration for Children's Services (“ACS”) was, \nand is, a municipal agency of the City responsible for protecting the safety and welfare of all \nchildren in New York City.  At all times relevant hereto, the officials, agents and employees of \nACS were acting under the color of state law in the course and scope of their duties and \nfunctions as agents, servants, employees and officials of ACS and otherwise performed and \nengaged in conduct incidental to the performance of their lawful duties.  The officials, agents and \nemployees were acting for, and on behalf of, ACS at all times relevant herein with the power and \nauthority vested in them as agents and employees of ACS and the City and incidental to their \nlawful pursuit of their duties as officials, employees and agents of ACS. \n125.  Defendant Gladys Carrión is Commissioner of ACS and is sued solely in her \nofficial capacity.  She is responsible for ACS’s policies, practices and operations, and for \nensuring that ACS and the private agencies with which it contracts comply with all applicable \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 43 of 111\nfederal and state laws, pursuant to the Charter of the City of New York, Chapter 24-B §§ 615 and \n617.  All children in foster care in New York City are in the custody of Defendant Carrión, and \nshe is responsible for ensuring their health, safety and well-being, including, but not limited to, \ntheir freedom from maltreatment while in state custody and their placement in a permanent home \nwithin a reasonable period of time. \n126.  Defendant State of New York (“State”) was, and is, a governmental entity.  It is \nauthorized by law to maintain and is ultimately responsible for the New York State Office of \nChildren and Family Services, which acts as its agent in the area of foster care, adoption and \nadoption assistance for children in New York State.  The State assumes the risks incidental to the \nmaintenance of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. \n127.  Defendant New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) \nwas, and is, an agency of the State responsible for programs involving foster care, adoption and \nadoption assistance for children in New York State.  At all times relevant hereto, the officials, \nagents and employees of OCFS were acting under the color of state law in the course and scope \nof their duties and functions as agents, servants, employees and officials of OCFS and otherwise \nperformed and engaged in conduct incidental to the performance of their lawful duties.  The \nofficials, agents and employees were acting for, and on behalf of, OCFS at all times relevant \nherein with the power and authority vested in them as agents and employees of OCFS and the \nState and incidental to their lawful pursuit of their duties as officials, employees and agents of \nOCFS. \n128.  Defendant Sheila J. Poole is Acting Commissioner of OCFS and is sued solely in \nher official capacity.  She is responsible for the policies, practices and operation of OCFS, for \nensuring OCFS’s compliance with all applicable federal and state law, pursuant to New York \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 44 of 111\nState Social Services Law §§ 11 and 17, and for providing oversight to all social services \ndistricts in the state.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n129.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343(a).  The Court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims based \non New York law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  \n130.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2002 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n131.  Venue in this district is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because the claims \narise in this district.  Although OCFS and ACS are responsible for children from all five \nboroughs of New York City, including those in the Eastern District of New York, the \nCommissioner of ACS has custody of all Plaintiff Children, and ACS’s administrative and \nmanagerial functions are operated out of its headquarters, which is located in the Southern \nDistrict of New York. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n132.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n133.  The general class is defined as all children who are now or will be in the foster \ncare custody of the Commissioner of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services \n(“Plaintiff Children” or the “Class”). \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 45 of 111\n134.  The Class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable.  As of April \n2015, there were  approximately 11,137 children in the foster care custody of the Commissioner \nof ACS. \n135.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiff Children’s claims are \ncommon to and typical of those of each putative member of the Class whom they seek to \nrepresent.  The Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children rely on Defendants for foster \ncare services in New York City and wholly depend on the State and City Defendants for \nprovision of those services.  Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions substantially depart from accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate \nindifference to the harm, risk of harm and violations of legal rights suffered by the Named \nPlaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children. \n136.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \na.  whether State and City Defendants fail to protect Plaintiff Children from \nphysical, psychological and emotional harm;  \nb.  whether State and City Defendants fail to ensure meaningful case plans to \nenable Plaintiff Children to be safely returned to their parents or, if that \nwere not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place them in \npermanent homes;  \nc.  whether State and City Defendants fail to provide foster care placements \nand services that ensure Plaintiff Children’s well-being; and \nd.  whether ACS fails to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and \ncase planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 46 of 111\n137.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \na.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s substantive rights under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; \nb.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s right to a permanent home and family \nunder the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; \nc.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s rights under the Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997; \nd.  whether Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and \ninactions violate Plaintiff Children’s rights under New York State Social \nServices Law and regulations adopted pursuant thereto; and \ne.  whether City Defendants’ actions and inactions violate Plaintiff Children’s \nrights as third party beneficiaries to the contracts between the City \nDefendants and the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the \nday-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children.  \n138.  The violations of law and resulting harms averred by Named Plaintiffs are typical \nof the legal violations and harms and/or risk of harms experienced by all Plaintiff Children in the \nClass. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 47 of 111\n139.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class that \nthey seek to represent.  Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children are represented by the following \nattorneys who are competent and experienced in class action litigation, child welfare litigation \nand complex civil litigation: \na.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, an attorney with A Better Childhood, Inc., a \nnon-profit legal advocacy organization, who has substantial experience \nand expertise in federal child welfare class actions nationally; and \nb.  Attorneys from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, including attorney Julie A. \nNorth, a Member of the Firm, who has significant experience in complex \nlitigation in state and federal courts throughout the United States. \nPlaintiff Children’s attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all claims in this action \nand have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class through trial and any appeals.  \nEach Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c), \nand each next friend is sufficiently familiar with the facts of the child’s situation and dedicated to \nthe child’s best interests to fairly and adequately represent the child’s best interests in this \nlitigation. \n140.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nmembers of the Class, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief.  Counsel for \nPlaintiff Children know of no conflict among the Class members. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 48 of 111\nSTRUCTURE OF THE NEW YORK CITY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n141.  Children in foster care in New York City are in the legal custody of the \nCommissioner of ACS (currently, Defendant Carrión) (“ACS custody”).  At all times, ACS \nmaintains legal custody and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City. \n142.  Pursuant to its Charter, the City of New York and Defendant Carrión, as \nCommissioner of ACS, are responsible for ensuring that ACS complies with federal and state \nlaw. \n143.  New York State provides funding to New York City that is spent on child welfare \nservices, and, through OCFS, is responsible for overseeing ACS and ensuring that ACS complies \nwith all applicable federal and state laws.  OCFS is also responsible for ensuring that ACS \ncomplies with all elements of the state plans (which OCFS signs as a condition of receiving child \nwelfare funds from the United States Department of Health and Human Services) that document \nhow the state will comply with certain core policies and procedures intended to, among other \nthings, either enable children in foster care to be reunited with their families and/or ensure timely \nefforts to find a permanent home for children who cannot be reunited with their families.  \n144.  Pursuant to the Constitution and federal and state statutory law, ACS, as the \ncustodian of children in foster care in New York City, is required to: \na.  Protect each child in foster care from physical, psychological and \nemotional harm, U.S. Const. amend. XIV; \nb.  Provide to each child in foster care the services necessary to ensure his or \nher physical, psychological and emotional well-being, U.S. Const. amend. \nXIV; \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 49 of 111\nc.  Provide to each child in foster care conditions, treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose and assumptions of custody, U.S. Const. \namend. XIV; \nd.  Ensure that each child in foster care is not maintained in custody longer \nthan is necessary to accomplish the purpose of custody, U.S. Const. \namend. XIV;  \ne.

Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 18, § 421.8. \n145.  By contract, ACS has delegated the care of the City’s children in foster care to \nagencies (“Contract Agencies”).  ACS currently has entered into valid and enforceable contracts \nwith 29 Contract Agencies.  The contracts into which ACS has entered with each of the Contract \nAgencies (referred to herein as the “Agreements”) require the Contract Agencies to comply with \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 52 of 111\nall applicable ACS policies, as well as state and federal law.  The Agreements also require the \nContract Agencies to provide comprehensive foster care services as defined in the Agreements.1   \n146.  Regardless of the terms of the Agreements, by law, ACS at all times maintains \nlegal custody of and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City.  \nHowever, ACS has failed and continues to fail to ensure the protection of Plaintiff Children’s \nrights under federal and state constitutional and statutory law.   \n147.  Children in New York City enter foster care in one of two ways—they can be \nvoluntarily placed into foster care by their parents,2 or they can be removed from their parents by \nACS.  Most children in foster care in New York City have been removed from their parents.  \nWhen children are removed from their parents, the removal is either (a) pursuant to a Family \nCourt finding that the child is in danger of abuse or neglect if left with his or her parents or \n(b) on an emergency basis, subject to a later finding by the Family Court that the child would \nhave been in danger of abuse or neglect if he or she had been left with his or her legal parents.  In \nboth cases, the Family Court must hold a fact-finding hearing to determine whether the child was \nin danger of being abused or neglected if left with his or her parents.  After the fact-finding \nhearing, the Family Court holds a disposition hearing to determine whether the child can safely \nbe returned home or should remain in foster care pending the completion of certain actions (e.g., \ntreatment for drug or alcohol addiction, anger management classes, etc.).   \n                                                 \n1 Each Agreement between the Contract Agency and ACS is for a particular set of foster placement services.  \nTherefore, one Contract Agency may have multiple Agreements with ACS, each for a different type of placement.  \nAppendix A lists, to the best of our information and belief, the Agreements which were current as of November \n2014 (see ¶ 119) and that are still in force today.   \n2 Unless otherwise specified, the term “parents” as used herein refers to the person(s) who have legal custody \nor legal responsibility for the child prior to his or her entry into foster care, and may include biological parents, \ngrandparents, adoptive parents or other legal guardians.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 53 of 111\n148.  Once a child enters foster care, ACS “places” the child with a Contract Agency, to \nwhich ACS delegates the day-to-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, the child.  \nUpon information and belief, placement with a Contract Agency is determined largely by which \nContract Agency has availability when placement is sought, not by a determination of the child’s \nhealth, safety or permanency needs, or of the ability of a potential available placement to meet \nthose needs.   \n149.  The Contract Agency with which the child has been placed then assigns the child \na foster placement, which can be either a traditional home-like setting or residential facility.3  \nUpon information and belief, foster placements are determined largely by availability at the time \nthe placement is sought, not by a determination of the child’s health, safety or permanency \nneeds, or of the ability of a potential available placement to meet those needs.   \n150.  Once a child is placed with a Contract Agency, caseworkers employed by that \nContract Agency are responsible for generating and recommending a case plan for the child.   \n151.  Pursuant to federal and state law, ACS is required to ensure that a case plan \nmeeting statutory criteria and professional standards is prepared for each child in foster care.  In \nNew York, these case plans are referred to as Family Assessment and Service Plans (“FASP”).  \nEach child’s FASP must describe, among other things, the child’s physical and mental health \nneeds, the child’s permanency goal, the services necessary to meet the child’s physical and \nmental needs as identified in the case plan and the services necessary to help the child achieve \nhis or her permanency goal as identified in the case plan.   \n                                                 \n3 Residential facilities include boarding homes, group homes, group residences, and institutions or residential \ntreatment facilities.  Residential facilities are the most restrictive settings, usually intended for the placement of \nolder children with severe clinical, medical, mental and/or behavioral problems.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 54 of 111\n152.  Pursuant to state and federal law, ACS also is responsible for ensuring that each \nchild’s case plan is implemented, and for providing each child in its custody with the services \nnecessary to meet the child’s physical and mental needs as identified in the case plan and the \nservices necessary to help the child achieve his or her permanency goal as identified in the case \nplan.   \n153.  ACS delegates the preparation of such case plans and the provision of such \nservices to the Contract Agency with which the child has been placed.  However, ACS fails to \nensure that the Contract Agencies prepare meaningful and appropriate FASPs for each child in \nACS custody, as required by state law.  ACS also fails to ensure that the Contract Agencies \nprovide the services necessary to meet both the child’s physical and mental needs and to help the \nchild achieve his or her permanency goal (as identified in the case plan), as required by law. \n154.  Foster care is intended to be temporary—a short-term placement until a child can \nbe safely reunified with his or her parents or, where that is not possible, placed into another \nstable, permanent home.   \n155.  Accordingly, federal and state law require ACS to ensure that each child in foster \ncare has a “permanency goal” and that reasonable efforts are made to reach each child’s \nestablished permanency goal within a reasonable period of time.  There are five possible \npermanency goals:  (1) return to parent; (2) adoption; (3) legal guardianship or kinship \nguardianship; (4) placement with a relative; and (5) another planned permanent living \narrangement (“APPLA”), the permanency goal given to children who will “age out” of the foster \ncare system.   \n156.  ACS delegates case planning responsibility, including assigning permanency \ngoals and making reasonable efforts toward permanency goals, to the Contract Agency with \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 55 of 111\nwhich each child in ACS custody has been placed.  However, ACS fails to ensure that the \nContract Agencies engage in meaningful and appropriate permanency planning, as required by \nfederal and state law. \n157.  Federal law requires ACS to ensure that caseworkers engage in concurrent \nplanning, so that each child in ACS custody has a primary permanency goal and a secondary \npermanency goal, both of which the caseworker must work toward simultaneously.  For \nexample, if a child’s primary permanency goal is “return to parent” and the secondary \npermanency goal is “adoption”, concurrent planning requires simultaneous provision of \nnecessary services so that the child can be returned home safely and recruitment of potential \nadoptive parents in the event the child is unable to be returned home safely.  The purpose of \nconcurrent planning is to limit the harm caused to the child by a lengthy stay in foster care by \nensuring that the child is placed into a permanent home within a reasonable period of time.   \n158.  ACS delegates case planning responsibility, including engaging in concurrent \nplanning, to the Contract Agency with which each child in ACS custody has been placed.  \nHowever, ACS fails to ensure that the Contract Agencies engage in meaningful and appropriate \nconcurrent planning, as required by federal law. \n159.  Federal and state law require ACS to ensure that a child’s case plan is periodically \nreviewed to ensure that the child’s permanency goal is appropriate and that progress is being \nmade toward safely returning the child to his or her parent or, if that were not possible within a \nreasonable period of time, placing the child in a permanent home.  By state statute, an initial \nFASP review must be held between 60 and 90 days after the child is placed in foster care, and \nsubsequent FASP reviews must be held no less than every six months thereafter.  ACS must \nensure that the caseworker and all relevant persons, including, but not limited to, the parents of \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 56 of 111\nthe child, relatives, the foster parent and the child, if old enough, participate in the FASP \nreviews.  However, ACS fails to ensure that meaningful and appropriate FASP reviews occur as \nrequired by state law. \n160.  By state statute, a permanency hearing must be held in the Family Court within \neight months of a child’s removal from his or her parents and every six months thereafter, and \nthat permanency hearing must be completed within 30 days.  The purpose of permanency \nhearings is to provide each child in ACS custody with timely judicial review of the child’s \npermanency goal and whether progress has been made toward achieving that goal.   \n161.  Because ACS fails to ensure that all parties are prepared for court and that \nContract Agencies submit necessary paperwork in a timely fashion, such permanency hearings \noften are not completed within the time period required by state law.  In many if not most \ninstances, the permanency hearings are held before the Family Court has even made a \ndetermination about whether the parent from whom the child was removed has in fact neglected \nor abused the child. \n162.  Federal and state law provide that ACS must, after a child is removed from his or \nher parents, make a reasonable effort to preserve family relationships, which includes providing \nservices to the child’s parents.  Federal law and policy dictate that the preferred course of action \nis to reunify the child with his or her parents.   \n163.  ACS has delegated its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to reunify each \nchild in its custody with his or her parents to the Contract Agency with which the child has been \nplaced.  However, ACS fails to ensure that reasonable efforts are being made or that necessary \nservices are being provided to enable children in ACS custody to be returned home within a \nreasonable period of time, as required by federal and state law. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 57 of 111\n164.  Even while efforts are being made to reunify a child with his or her parents, \nfederal law and professional standards also require ACS to ensure that concurrent planning—i.e., \nto pursue another permanency option for the child in the event that the child cannot safely be \nreturned to his or her parents (see supra ¶ 157)—occurs.  That means that ACS should not wait \nmonths or years until reunification efforts have failed to begin alternative permanency planning, \nincluding identifying other potential permanent homes for the child. \n165.  Federal and state law require ACS to determine within a reasonable period of time \nwhether or not a child in foster care can be safely and appropriately returned to his or her \nparents, and if not, to initiate a petition to terminate parental rights so that the child is legally \navailable to be adopted.  ACS has delegated the responsibility for making that determination to \nthe Contract Agency with which each child in ACS custody has been placed.  However, ACS \nfails to ensure that the Contract Agency makes that determination within a reasonable time, as \nrequired by federal and state law.  \n166.   Under federal and state law, ACS must file a petition to terminate parental rights \n(“TPR”) when a child has been in foster care for 15 of the previous 22 months, subject to certain \nexceptions that must be documented.  Under state law, ACS must file a TPR petition (a) within \n30 days of establishing a primary permanency goal of “adoption”; (b) within 60 days of \ncompleting a FASP that documents abandonment or permanent neglect of a child; and (c) within \n60 days of a judicial determination that a child was abandoned.  ACS has delegated its \nresponsibility to file TPR petitions to the Contract Agency with which each child in its custody \nhas been placed.  However, ACS fails to ensure that TPR petitions are filed within the time \nperiods required by federal and state law.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 58 of 111\n167.  Once parental rights have been terminated and a child in ACS custody is \nconsidered “freed” for adoption, state statutory law and regulations require ACS to take a \nnumber of additional steps to place that child into a permanent home, including (a) timely acting \non applications by persons looking to adopt children; (b) initiating and completing adoption \nstudies (evaluations of an applicant’s ability to be an adoptive parent) within certain time \nperiods; (c) placing children in adoptive homes within certain time periods; and (d) finalizing \nadoptions within certain time periods.  However, as the concept of concurrent planning (see \nsupra ¶ 157) makes clear, ACS should have been identifying other potential permanent homes \nfor the child well before the child is freed for adoption.  ACS has delegated these responsibilities \nto the Contract Agency with which each child in its custody has been placed; however, ACS fails \nto ensure that the necessary and appropriate steps are taken to develop an appropriate pool of \nadoptive families and to place children who have been freed for adoption into adoptive homes, as \nrequired by state law.  \n168.  Although ACS has delegated the provision of comprehensive foster care services \nin New York City to 29 Contract Agencies, that delegation does not and cannot supplant ACS’s \nresponsibilities to Plaintiff Children under federal and state law.  ACS has legal custody of all \nchildren in foster care in New York City.  ACS accordingly has legal responsibility for ensuring \nthat the rights of all children in foster care in New York City are protected—which ACS has \nfailed, and continues to fail, to do. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 59 of 111\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES  \nPLAGUING NEW YORK CITY’S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND  \nRESULTING HARM TO PLAINTIFF CHILDREN \n169.  The experiences and current situations of the Named Plaintiff Children as \ndescribed above are neither unusual nor aberrational.  Rather, they are merely examples that are \nfar too typical of the irreparable harm being suffered by all children in ACS custody.   \n170.  Defendants are harming Plaintiff Children by: \na.  failing to protect Plaintiff Children from physical, psychological and \nemotional harm;  \nb.  failing to ensure the development and implementation of meaningful case \nplans to enable Plaintiff Children to be safely returned to their parents or, \nif that were not possible within a reasonable period of time, to place them \nin permanent homes; and  \nc.  failing to provide foster care placements and services to ensure Plaintiff \nChildren’s well-being. \n171.  These harms are a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well \ndocumented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic \ndeficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years: \na.  ACS fails to exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over the Contract \nAgencies to which ACS has delegated the day-to-day care of, and case \nplanning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 60 of 111\nb.  ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers are assigned \ncaseloads and receive appropriate training consistent with professional \nstandards. \nc.  ACS fails to provide a system for making foster placements consistent \nwith federal and state law and minimum professional standards. \nd.  ACS fails to ensure case and service plans are developed and implemented \nconsistent with federal and state law and minimum professional standards. \ne.  ACS fails to take all necessary and available action to ensure timely \nadjudication of family court proceedings involving children in ACS \ncustody consistent with federal and state law and minimum professional \nstandards. \nAll of Defendants’ actions and inactions as described herein substantially depart from accepted \nprofessional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of legal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \n172.  Put simply, as a result of Defendants’ failures, caseworkers employed by the \nContract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the care of Plaintiff Children often are \ninexperienced, undertrained, under-supervised, overworked and underpaid; case planning often is \nsloppy and ineffective; there are not enough suitable and appropriate foster and pre-adoptive \nplacements to meet Plaintiff Children’s needs; and a lack of urgency and accountability pervades \nNew York City’s foster care system.   \n173.  Defendants have long been aware of these systemic failures and the resulting \nharm to the vulnerable children in ACS custody.  Since 2000, OCFS has undergone two federal \nperformance audits of the New York State child welfare system, known as Child and Family \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 61 of 111\nServices Reviews (“CFSR”).  These reviews are conducted by the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services to assess the performance of child welfare systems across the \ncountry, including the outcomes achieved for children, to identify areas in which systemic \nimprovement is required to assure appropriate outcomes for children, and to implement \ncorrective actions where outcomes for children are found to be deficient.  States are evaluated on \nseven outcome indicators of safety, permanency and well-being—the unequivocal goals of all \nfoster care systems pursuant to federal statutory law—and on seven systemic factors that affect \nthe state’s capacity to deliver foster care services effectively.  \n174.  The two federal audits completed to date revealed myriad areas in which the New \nYork State foster care system was causing harm to the children in its care, and that New York \nState’s foster care system was getting worse.  The first CFSR audit, which was published in \n2002, found that New York State failed to conform to federal expectations in five of the seven \nsafety, permanency and well-being indicators, and in three of the seven systemic factors.  Seven \nyears later, New York State performed worse.  During the second CFSR audit, which was \npublished in 2009, the federal government determined that New York State failed to conform to \nfederal expectations in all seven safety, permanency and well-being indicators, and in five of the \nseven systemic factors.  New York State’s CFSR results are heavily influenced by New York \nCity’s child welfare system, which accounted for well over 60% of children in foster care in New \nYork State in both 2002 and 2009. \n175.  Notwithstanding having had 13 years to improve performance since the first \nCFSR audit of New York State, Defendants continue to place New York City children in ACS \ncustody at significant risk of harm.  The most recent federal data available shows that children in \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 62 of 111\nNew York State spend longer in foster care and are more likely to be maltreated while in foster \ncare than children in virtually all other states.  \n176.  Defendants are not acting with sufficient urgency to address these known failures \nor to meet their legal obligations to protect the children in New York City’s foster care system.   \nI.  DEFENDANTS ARE CAUSING IRREPARABLE HARM TO CHILDREN IN ACS \nCUSTODY. \nA.  Defendants Fail To Protect Children in ACS Custody from Maltreatment.  \n177.  Maltreatment of children in foster care is a significant problem in New York City. \n178.  New York City currently accounts for almost 60% of children in foster care in \nNew York State, which lags far behind the nation with respect to the protection of children in \nfoster care.   \n179.  Based on the most recent federal data available, New York State ranks 46th out of \n48 states and territories for instances of substantiated or indicated maltreatment of children while \nin foster care.  Put simply, children in New York are more likely to be harmed while under the \nstate’s protection than children in virtually every other state.  \n180.  New York State has had a high rate of maltreatment in foster care for years.  In \nboth the 2002 and 2009 CFSRs, the federal government found that New York State did not meet \nthe national standard for the rate of maltreatment in foster care.  Based on the most recent federal \ndata available, New York State did not meet the national standard for 2013. \n181.  Upon information and belief, the high rate of maltreatment in care in New York \nState is largely driven by maltreatment of children in ACS custody in New York City, which \naccounts for the majority of children in foster care in New York State. \n182.  All investigations of maltreatment, including those pertaining to children in foster \ncare custody, begin with a call to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 63 of 111\nMaltreatment (“SCR”).  According to ACS, in 2014, SCR received 1,987 reports of maltreatment \nof children in ACS custody (i.e., children in foster care in New York City).  ACS’s Office of \nSpecial Investigation investigates reports of maltreatment made to the SCR, including those for \nchildren already in foster care; a report of maltreatment is “substantiated” when sufficient \nevidence is found to support a determination that a child was in fact maltreated.  Of the 1,987 \nreports of maltreatment in foster care received by SCR in 2014, 28% were substantiated.  The \nChildren’s Bureau of the federal government does not publish comparable data. \n183.  The high rate of maltreatment of children in ACS custody is a direct result of \nDefendants’ long-standing and well-documented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to \nremedy structural and systemic deficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care \nsystem for years.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Plaintiff Children are protected from maltreatment \nsubstantially departs from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nB.  Defendants Fail To Provide Children in ACS Custody with Permanent Homes and \nFamilies Within a Reasonable Time.  \n184.  Foster care is intended to be temporary.  Children who do not grow up in stable \nfamily environments are less likely to complete their education, to form healthy relationships or \nto be otherwise prepared to live healthy, satisfying adult lives.  Accordingly, federal and state \nlaw and professional standards dictate that foster children should be placed in permanent homes \nas quickly as is safely possible, whether with their parents, another relative or an adoptive \nfamily. \n185.  But ACS allows Plaintiff Children to languish for years in foster care without \npermanent homes or families to call their own.  Indeed, the most recent federal data available \nshows that New York City lags far behind the rest of New York State and the nation as a whole \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 64 of 111\nin placing children in foster care custody in permanent homes.  As a result, children spend longer \nin foster care custody in New York City than virtually everywhere else in the nation. \n1.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Children Are Timely and Safely Reunified \nwith Their Parents. \n186.  Federal and state law provide that ACS must, in the first instance, make \nreasonable efforts to preserve a child’s relationship with his or her family.  After a child is \nremoved from home due to allegations of abuse or neglect, federal and state law and policy \ndictate that the preferred course of action is to reunify the child with his or her parents.  \nReunification, however, is only appropriate where the reason for removal has been addressed \nthrough appropriate services to the family so that the child’s safety is assured.  As a result, ACS \nmust ensure the provision of appropriate and effective services4 so that children in ACS custody \ncan safely return home.   \n187.  ACS fails to ensure that children in ACS custody are safely returned to their \nparents within a reasonable period of time.   \na.  It takes longer to return children in foster care to their parents in New \nYork City than in the rest of New York State and the rest of the nation as a \nwhole.  The most recent federal data available shows that children in New \nYork City had spent a median of over a year—12.6 months—in foster care \nbefore being reunified with their parents, while children in the rest of New \nYork State spent a median of 10.8 months, and children in the rest of the \nnation spent a median of 8.6 months in foster care prior to reunification.   \n                                                 \n4 Necessary reunification services, which should be established and set forth in the child’s case plan, may \ninclude psychological evaluations and/or care, substance abuse treatment, parenting classes or assistance, or \nassistance with accessing adequate housing. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 65 of 111\nb.  New York City takes longer to return children in foster care to their \nparents than all but five other states and territories.  Based on the most \nrecent available federal data comparing the median number of days \nchildren spent in foster care prior to being returned to their parents, New \nYork City ranks 48th of 53 jurisdictions.    \n188.  ACS also fails to ensure that children are safely returned to their parents.  \nChildren who are eventually reunified with their legal parents too often re-enter foster care due \nto further abuse or neglect.  In 2014, 13.9% of foster care placements in New York City were of \nchildren who had been in foster care within the previous three years.  Failed reunifications cause \nharm to children both as a result of additional maltreatment—in the worst cases, severe injury or \neven death—and the trauma that accompanies repeated family separation. \n2.  Defendants Fail To Ensure a Timely Permanent Home for Children in \nACS Custody when Reunification Is Not Possible. \n189.  When a child cannot be returned safely to his or her parents, federal and state law \nrequire ACS to promptly find children in its custody alternative permanent homes, typically \nthrough adoption or kinship guardianship. \n190.  However, ACS fails to secure timely adoptions for too many children in its \ncustody who cannot safely be returned to their parents.  Instead, these children languish in ACS \ncustody for years without a permanent home or family to call their own. \na.  For children who cannot be safely returned to their parents, it takes longer \nto be adopted in New York City than in the rest of New York State.  It also \ntakes longer to be adopted in New York City than in every other state in \nthe nation.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 66 of 111\nb.  Children who were adopted in New York City in 2013 spent a median of \n55.8 months—over 4.5 years—in foster care prior to adoption.  In \ncontrast, children in the rest of New York State spent almost two years \nless time—a median of 32.6 months—in foster care prior to being \nadopted, and children in the rest of the nation spent less than half that \namount of time—a median of 26.9 months—in foster care prior to being \nadopted.   \nc.  Based on the most recent available federal data comparing the median \nnumber of days children spent in foster care prior to being adopted, New \nYork City ranks dead last—a fact that has been true since at least 2007.   \n191.  The City Defendants are well aware that it takes over 4.5 years for a child to be \nadopted in New York City.  The City has published that fact for the past five years in its Mayor’s \nManagement Reports. \n3.  Defendants’ Failure To Provide Children in ACS Custody Permanent \nHomes Within a Reasonable Period of Time Causes Irreparable Harm. \n192.  Research has shown that permanent homes and families are critical to ensuring a \nchild’s healthy development and continue to confer benefits that contribute to the child’s success \nthroughout life.  Being placed with a permanent family helps infants with brain development; \nyoung children with self esteem, healthy attachment and behavior regulation; and adolescents \nwith independence and healthy boundary-setting.  Parental support and a stable, familiar \nenvironment also help children cope after traumatic experiences. \n193.  Conversely, research has shown that children suffer when they grow up in state \ncustody without the protective effects of a permanent home and family.  Each year, \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 67 of 111\napproximately 1,000 young people “age out” of New York City’s foster care system, the vast \nmajority on their own with virtually no safety net.  These children suffer irreparable harm.  \nResearch has shown that children who “age out” of foster care are more likely than their peers to \nbe unemployed, homeless and incarcerated as adults; are more likely to have drug dependence \nand post-traumatic stress disorder; and are less likely to have graduated high school, attended \ncollege, or to have a savings or checking account. \n194.  Too frequently, caseworkers push children to accept the permanency goal of \nAPPLA—the goal given to children who will “age out” of the foster care system—at young ages, \noften failing to explore other options, such as adoption or placement with a relative.  ACS allows \ntoo many children who cannot safely be returned home to be deemed “unadoptable” without \nmaking reasonable efforts to search for or secure permanent homes for those children.  ACS also \nfails to explore alternative permanency options for older teens who may express that they do not \nwant to be adopted but who would nevertheless benefit from a permanent and stable adult \nconnection. \n195.  Defendants have long been aware of the harm children suffer when they do not \ngrow up in a permanent home or have a permanent family.  In February 2011, Defendant OCFS \nsent ACS and the Contract Agencies an informational letter stating that “children who have a \nsignificant connection to an adult generally fare better” and that “[s]tudies of youth who leave \nfoster care without a safe, permanent family reveal consistently negative life outcomes.”  \nHowever, Defendants have made no meaningful efforts to improve permanency for Plaintiff \nChildren.  \n196.  ACS’s failure to provide Plaintiff Children with permanent homes within a \nreasonable period of time is a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 68 of 111\nactions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic deficiencies that \nhave plagued New York City’s foster care system for years.  ACS’s failure to ensure that \nPlaintiff Children are placed in permanent homes within a reasonable period of time substantially \ndeparts from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the \nrisk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nC.  Defendants Fail To Provide Foster Placements and Services that Ensure the Well-\nBeing of Children in ACS Custody. \n197.  Federal and state law and professional standards require ACS to ensure foster care \nservices are provided in a manner that ensures the well-being of each child in ACS custody. \n198.  Federal and state law and professional standards require ACS to ensure that each \nchild in ACS custody is placed in the most appropriate, least restrictive placement available.  The \nabrupt and overwhelming change of being removed from his or her parents and placed into ACS \ncustody can further traumatize a child.  In the process of initial placement, children are removed, \noften abruptly, from familiar surroundings and lose everything known and comforting.  Research \nhas shown that change of this magnitude has a detrimental effect on brain and neurological \nfunction and other negative physiological effects.5  Accordingly, foster placements should be \nbased on an assessment of the individual child’s needs and should promote stability and \ncontinuity by placing children with relatives, keeping children in their communities and schools, \nand keeping siblings together whenever possible.  \n                                                 \n5 This is one reason why children, especially very young children, often regress in their development and \nbehaviors (e.g., toilet training, talking, etc.) after being removed from their parents.  Separation from family, and the \nresulting attachment disruption, may intensify these negative physiological effects and is particularly devastating for \nyounger children. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 69 of 111\n199.  Instead, ACS further harms Plaintiff Children by putting them in inappropriate \nfoster placements ill-equipped to meet their needs, which results in far too many children being \nshuffled from foster placement to foster placement: \na.  In December 2011, ACS published data stating that 14% of children then \nin ACS custody had experienced more than six transfers while in foster \ncare; and additional 16% had been shuffled from between three and five \nplacements.  \nb.  More recently, in July 2015, the Public Advocate published a report, \nfinding that 26% of the foster children surveyed had experienced five or \nmore transfers while in ACS custody. \n200.  Being shuffled from foster placement to foster placement negatively affects a \nchild’s well-being.  Children may be dropped off at a new place with no explanation for where \nthey are going and why.  This degree of turbulence can lead to emotional trauma and attachment \ndisorders, and causes children to lose all sense of stability and security.  Frequent moves may \nresult in children losing contact with siblings, other family members, friends and adults in their \ncommunity who may have been involved in their lives.   \n201.  Multiple placements can also cause educational interruptions and compromise the \nchild’s ability to finish school.  Federal statutory law and reasonable professional standards \nrequire ACS to make reasonable efforts to keep children in the same school whenever possible.   \n202.  As a result, for too many children in ACS custody, moving foster placements \nmeans changing schools, losing teachers and friends.  In 2009, Children’s Rights, a national \nadvocacy organization for abused and neglected children, ACS and the Legal Aid Society \nJuvenile Rights Practice conducted a study of children in New York City’s foster care system \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 70 of 111\n(referred to herein as “The Long Road Home Study”).6   The Long Road Home Study found that \n30% of children studied had experienced at least one school transfer within the past year and that \nchildren who had experienced more than one placement move in a one-year period were \nsignificantly more likely to have experienced a school transfer as well.   \n203.  The failure to provide educational stability—like the failure to provide placement \nstability—further damages children in ACS custody.  School is often the one place where \nchildren who are being abused or neglected at home feel safe, so changing schools can be \ntraumatic.  Research has also shown that children in foster care have lower standardized test \nscores, poorer academic performance and higher rates of grade retention, absenteeism, tardiness, \ntruancy and dropout than their peers.  According to data from the New York City Department of \nEducation, foster youth in 8th grade score significantly lower than their peers in English and \nmath.   \n204.  Federal and state law also require ACS to ensure that all children in its legal \ncustody receive the necessary services to ensure their well-being.  This includes adequate \nmedical, dental and mental health assessments and follow-up care; educational assessments and \nservices; independent living services; substance abuse treatment; or family planning services, as \nneeded.   \n205.  However, ACS fails to ensure that all children in its custody are provided with \nthese essential services to ensure their well-being:   \na.  New York City fails to meet the national standard for providing adequate \nmedical, dental and mental health care.  In the 2009 CFSR, for example, \n                                                 \n6 The results of this study were published in a November 2009 report entitled “The Long Road Home:  A Study \nof Children Stranded in New York City Foster Care”. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 71 of 111\nthe federal government determined that only 73% of children in New York \nCity received adequate services to meet their physical and mental health \nneeds—well below the national benchmark of 95%. \nb.  The Long Road Home Study found that ACS failed to ensure the provision \nof necessary mental health services for a substantial number of children in \nits custody—16% of children studied who needed a mental health \nassessment, 19% of children studied who needed individual therapy and \n11% of children studied who needed psychotropic medication had not \nreceived those critical mental health services within the past year.  The \nstudy also found that many children who needed the B2H Medicaid \nwaiver program did not receive it because caseworkers failed to make \ntimely referrals or because there were not enough slots in the program. \n206.  These services are critical to the well-being of children in ACS custody, who are \nparticularly vulnerable to irreparable physical, psychological and emotional damage from ACS’s \nfailure to provide necessary services.  Children in foster care custody often have experienced \nsevere and chronic trauma, including physical or sexual abuse, neglect and domestic or \ncommunity violence, as well as other stressors such as extreme poverty or parental substance \nabuse.  Research has shown that children exposed to repeated traumatic stress or pervasive \nneglect, including children removed from their home due to abuse or neglect, manifest increased \nphysical, psychological and emotional problems later in life.  Being placed in and left to languish \nin foster care without a permanent home or family further compounds these problems.   \n207.  According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, exposure to trauma \nderails development in children of all ages.  Young children (five and younger) may experience \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 72 of 111\nsensitivity to noise, avoidance of contact, heightened startle response, confusion about what is \ndangerous and who to go to for protection, and fear of being separated from familiar people and \nplaces.  School-aged children (ages six to 12) may exhibit emotional swings, learning problems, \nspecific anxieties and fears, attention seeking behavior and reversion to younger behaviors.  \nAdolescents (13 to 21) may have difficulty imagining or planning for the future, over- or under-\nestimate danger, display inappropriate aggression, and engage in reckless and/or self-destructive \nbehaviors. \n208.  Accordingly, it is critical that all children in ACS custody are properly assessed \nand receive necessary services as soon as possible to facilitate their recovery from the trauma \nthey already have experienced.  However, ACS fails to ensure that all children in its custody are \nprovided with these critical services within a reasonable period of time.   \n209.  ACS also fails to ensure that the quality of services being provided to Plaintiff \nChildren is consistent with professional standards.  Upon information and belief, many Contract \nAgencies do not directly provide services; instead, they refer foster children to other service \nproviders with which the City contracts.  However, upon information and belief, the City \nDefendants do not exercise adequate and meaningful oversight over these service providers.  \nUpon information and belief, most mental health services provided to children in ACS custody \nare ineffective and of poor quality, but ACS continues to renew contracts with these substandard \nservice providers while the few quality service providers have lengthy waiting lists. \n210.  ACS’s failure to provide Plaintiff Children with appropriate foster care \nplacements consistent with professional standards and services to ensure their physical, \npsychological and emotional well-being is a direct result of Defendants’ long-standing and well-\ndocumented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural and systemic \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 73 of 111\ndeficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years.  These failures \nsubstantially depart from accepted professional judgment and demonstrate a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \nII.  DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO REMEDY THE SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \nPLAGUING NEW YORK CITY’S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n211.  The harms described in ¶¶ 177–210 are a direct result of Defendants’ long-\nstanding and well-documented actions and inactions and Defendants’ failure to remedy structural \nand systemic deficiencies that have plagued New York City’s foster care system for years, \nincluding: \na.  the City Defendants’ failure to exercise adequate and meaningful \noversight over the Contract Agencies to which ACS has delegated the day-\nto-day care of, and case planning responsibility for, Plaintiff Children to \nensure foster care services are provided consistent with federal and state \nlaw and minimum professional standards; \nb.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers are assigned \ncaseloads and receive appropriate training consistent with professional \nstandards; \nc.  ACS’s failure to provide a system for making foster placements consistent \nwith federal and state law and minimum professional standards; \nd.  ACS’s failure to ensure case and service plans are developed and \nimplemented consistent with federal and state law and minimum \nprofessional standards; and \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 74 of 111\ne.  ACS’s failure to take all necessary and available action to ensure timely \nadjudication of family court proceedings involving children in ACS \ncustody consistent with federal and state law and minimum professional \nstandards. \nThese failures substantially depart from accepted professional judgment and demonstrate a \ndeliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and violations of rights suffered by Plaintiff \nChildren. \nA.  City Defendants Fail To Exercise Adequate and Meaningful Oversight over \nContract Agencies. \n212.  By contract, ACS delegates its responsibility to provide children in its custody \nwith foster care services to Contract Agencies.  However, ACS at all times maintains legal \ncustody of and legal responsibility for all children in foster care in New York City.  ACS thus \nhas an obligation to Plaintiff Children to ensure that Contract Agencies are providing foster care \nservices consistent with all applicable law and professional standards.  ACS fails to do so. \n213.  Instead, ACS does not meaningfully supervise Contract Agencies or hold them \naccountable for underperformance.  As a result, ACS shirks its legal obligations to Plaintiff \nChildren while the City pays millions of dollars to Contract Agencies for the provision of foster \ncare services without ensuring that those services are adequately provided to Plaintiff Children.   \n214.  Under the Agreements, ACS is expressly required to supervise, monitor, audit and \nreview the activities of the Contract Agencies.  Currently, ACS conducts an annual evaluation, \ncalled “Scorecard”, of each Contract Agency to evaluate process, practice and outcome \nindicators in safety, permanency and well-being.  According to ACS’s 2014 Scorecard \nMethodology, the Scorecard evaluation involves reviewing a combination of case-specific and \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 75 of 111\naggregate data.  Each Contract Agency then receives a letter grade (from A to F) indicating its \nperformance for safety, for permanency and for well-being.   \n215.  The Scorecard evaluations are flawed and ineffective for at least the following \nreasons:   \na.  ACS fails to measure several key performance metrics.  For example, \nACS has failed to develop Scorecard measures to evaluate whether \nContract Agencies are successfully engaging in concurrent planning and \nwhether Contract Agencies are making efforts to recruit non-kinship foster \nparents and adoptive parents. \nb.  Upon information and belief, the results of the Scorecard evaluations do \nnot accurately reflect each Contract Agency’s performance in providing \nfoster care services to children in ACS custody.   \nc.  ACS’s performance standards are simply too low—upon information and \nbelief, the majority of Contract Agencies receive “passing” grades even \nthough New York City has one of the worst foster care systems in the \nnation. \n216.  ACS also fails to hold Contract Agencies accountable for underperformance on \nthe Scorecard evaluations.  According to ACS’s 2014 Scorecard Methodology, ACS’s Agency \nProgram Assistance team (“APA”) analyzes the Scorecard data to identify areas of strength and \nweakness for each Contract Agency and works collaboratively with each Contract Agency and \nwith ACS to improve performance.  APA sets benchmarks throughout the year for each Contract \nAgency; however these benchmarks are relative and set by taking into account the Contract \nAgency’s current performance, ACS standards and system-wide performance.   \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 76 of 111\n217.  When performance is “considerably or persistently poor”, APA can use \n“accountability mechanisms” in order to drive performance.  However, ACS does not adequately \nuse its accountability mechanisms to ensure appropriate performance of the Contract Agencies.  \nACS’s failure to make Scorecard data publicly available further decreases accountability. \n218.  As a direct result of ACS’s failure to meaningfully oversee the Contract Agencies, \nPlaintiff Children suffer irreparable harm because there simply are no consequences for the \nfailure to protect them from physical, psychological and emotional harm; the failure to enable \nthem to be safely returned to their parents or, if that were not possible within a reasonable period \nof time, to place them in permanent homes; and the failure to provide them with appropriate \nfoster placements and necessary services to ensure their well-being. \nB.  Defendants Fail To Ensure an Adequately Staffed and Appropriately Trained \nChild Welfare Workforce. \n219.  No foster care system can effectively perform its basic functions absent a well-\ntrained, experienced and adequately staffed workforce.  In New York City, ACS has delegated \nits obligation to care for the children in state custody to Contract Agencies, who in turn employ \nthe caseworkers that directly interact with children in foster care and their families.  However, \nACS fails to ensure that these caseworkers are adequately trained, supervised and staffed, \nconsistent with professional standards. \n1.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Caseworkers Are Adequately Trained and \nSupervised. \n220.  Caseworkers must be fluent in governing policy and procedure and familiar with \ncurrent best practices.  Consistent with professional standards, a foster care system should \nrequire pre-service training, which must be completed before caseworkers can carry an active \ncaseload, and mandatory annual in-service training designed to refresh caseworkers in basic \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 77 of 111\npolicy and procedure and to teach advances in policy and in the field.  In addition, it is critical to \nensure appropriate supervision. \n221.  ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers receive adequate training \nor supervision.  In 2009, the Long Road Home Study, which was performed in conjunction with \nACS, found that a substantial proportion of caseworkers had not received any training before \nbeing given responsibility for a caseload of foster children.  That same study also found that the \nquality of caseworker supervision at Contract Agencies was questionable.   \n2.  Caseworkers Carry Unmanageable Caseloads. \n222.  Child welfare research has shown that high caseworker caseloads negatively \nimpact children in foster care.  Caseworkers with high caseloads have less time to interact with \nchildren, families and service providers and provide meaningful and appropriate case plans, \nnecessary services, and timely casework and decision-making.  It is therefore critical that \ncaseworkers have manageable caseloads.   \n223.  However, in New York City, ACS fails to ensure that all Contract Agency \ncaseworkers carry caseloads consistent with professional standards.  \n224.  The Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a coalition of private and \npublic agencies that develops child welfare policies and promotes sound child welfare practice, \nhas established nationally recognized standards for caseworker caseloads.  The standards \ngoverning foster care caseworkers limit caseloads to between 12 and 15 children per worker.  \nThe Council on Accreditation (“COA”), an accrediting body that partners with human service \norganizations to improve child welfare service delivery outcomes, recommends that caseloads \nfor foster care caseworkers be limited to between eight and 15 children per worker, depending on \nthe needs of the children. \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 78 of 111\n225.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies comply \nwith these caseload standards, and many caseworkers’ caseloads in New York City exceed this \nstandard by a wide margin.  The Long Road Home Study found that caseworker caseloads \nexceed recommended sizes.  Similarly, at a briefing in January 2013, a member of ACS’s senior \nmanagement under the previous administration stated that caseloads could range from 16 to 24 \nchildren, noting that this was far too high.   \n226.  Excessive caseloads overburden caseworkers and prevent them from performing \ncasework consistent with federal and state law and professional standards. \n227.  High caseloads also contribute to burnout and turnover among caseworkers.  \nResearch has shown that Contract Agency caseworker turnover is associated with children \nexperiencing multiple placements, receiving fewer services, staying in foster care longer and \nfailing to achieve permanency.  When a case changes hands from caseworker to caseworker, \nrelationships are severed and valuable information is lost.  ACS does not publish system-wide \ndata regarding foster care caseworker turnover; upon information and belief, ACS does not \ncollect such data.  In 2006, the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies reported Contract \nAgency caseworker turnover rates of 40%.  In 2009, the Long Road Home Study reported that \ncaseworker turnover is a major barrier to permanency.  Upon information and belief, high foster \ncare caseworker turnover rates persist. \n3.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Regular Caseworker Visits To Children in \nFoster Homes or Congregate Care. \n228.  Caseworkers must have regular face-to-face contact with children in foster care, \nparents, and foster parents or child care workers.  The primary purpose of these contacts is to \nensure the safety and well-being of the children, to engage families in planning for their children, \nto assess the strengths and needs of all family members and caregivers, and to address the needs \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 79 of 111\nof all family members and caregivers in order to move children out of foster care and into \npermanent homes. \n229.  COA recommends that caseworkers meet separately with children, parents and \nfoster parents at least once a month.  ACS policy requires a minimum of monthly contact \nbetween caseworkers and children in foster care. \n230.  However, ACS fails to ensure that caseworkers are making sufficient contacts \nwith children, parents and foster parents to ensure the safety and well-being of children in ACS \ncustody.  The Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in conjunction with ACS in 2009, \nfound that caseworkers did not maintain adequate contact with children, parents and foster \nparents.   \n231.  Moreover, upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract \nAgencies make unannounced visits to ensure that children in ACS custody are protected from \nmaltreatment.  Upon information and belief, ACS also fails to ensure that visits with children \ntake place privately and out of the presence of the child’s caretaker. \n232.  ACS’s failure to ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers maintain contact with \nkey persons to ensure the safety and well-being of children in its care substantially departs from \nreasonable professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm \nto Plaintiff Children. \n233.  As a direct result of ACS’s failure to ensure that caseworkers maintain regular \ncontact with children, parents and foster parents, Plaintiff Children frequently suffer harm \nbecause their assigned caseworkers are unable to meaningfully assess the child’s safety and well-\nbeing and to provide necessary services to place the child into a permanent home.  ACS’s failure \nto ensure that Contract Agency caseworkers make sufficient contacts with the children in ACS \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 80 of 111\ncustody substantially departs from accepted professional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \n*** \n234.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that the first point of contact for \nall Plaintiff Children—the Contract Agency caseworkers—are trained, supervised, staffed and \nperforming visits consistent with professional standards, Plaintiff Children frequently suffer \nharm because their assigned caseworkers are ill-prepared to make the judgments necessary to \npromote their safety, permanency and well-being, unable to meaningfully address their complex \nand varied needs and unable to meaningfully assess the child’s safety and well-being or provide \nnecessary services.  ACS’s failures as described above substantially depart from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of legal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \nC.  Defendants’ Processes for Making Foster Placements in New York City Are \nDeficient. \n235.  When ACS removes a child from his or her parents, ACS is obligated to provide a \nsafe temporary home for that child until he or she is discharged from foster care.  Federal and \nstate law require ACS to ensure that each child in ACS custody is placed in the most appropriate, \nleast restrictive placement available.  Professional standards dictate that foster placements be \nbased on an assessment of the individual child’s needs and promote stability and continuity by \nplacing children with relatives, keeping children in their communities and schools, and keeping \nsiblings together whenever possible.   \n236.  In order to meet the needs of a large and diverse foster care population, ACS must \nensure the recruitment and maintenance of a sufficient number of homes to accommodate the \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 81 of 111\nnumber of children currently in custody and additional children as they enter the system on an \nongoing basis.  In addition, a sufficient array of placement types must be available to meet \nchildren’s needs.  The types of placements will range from “basic” foster homes that provide \nordinary parental care to children without heightened therapeutic needs, to more “therapeutic”, \n“intensive” or “specialized” foster homes that receive additional training and support for the care \nof more high-needs children, to more highly structured or “restrictive” group homes and \nresidential programs suitable for children who cannot yet thrive in a family setting.  In addition, \nplacements may vary in terms of their likelihood to develop into permanent or adoptive homes if \nthe child cannot safely be returned to his parents.   \n237.  Placement in a stable and appropriate foster home can be critical to a child’s \nchances of securing a permanent home because a child who cannot safely be returned to his \nparent is most likely to be adopted by kin or a foster parent.   \n238.  However, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies recruit and retain an \nadequate number and variety of placements to meet Plaintiff Children’s needs.  In particular, \nACS fails to ensure that a sufficient number of pre-adoptive homes are recruited and retained, \nparticularly for children who cannot safely be returned to their parents but who are “hard to \nplace” into adoptive homes, such as adolescents, children with health or behavioral problems and \nlarge sibling groups.   \n239.  Pursuant to the Agreements, the City pays each Contract Agency per diem \npayments for every day a child is in foster care, thus incentivizing Contract Agencies to keep \nchildren in care longer.  As a result, Contract Agencies may not pursue adoptive resources with \nurgency or offer sufficient resources for persons who are interested in adopting foster children.  \nUpon information and belief, Contract Agencies often tell individuals interested in adoption that \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 82 of 111\nthey are “in the business of fostering, not adoption”—even though ACS has delegated to them \nboth the care of children who safely can be returned to their parents and the care of children in \nneed of adoption and waiting desperately for a permanent home and family to call their own.   \n240.  The City and State Defendants have long been aware of, and have failed to fix, \nthis systemic failure.  Indeed, Defendant Carrión recently admitted that ACS “really need[s] to \ndo a better job of publicizing . . . we need to do more to get the message out that these children \nare waiting and that they need adoptive homes.”  However, the City Defendants have recently \ntaken actions that will make these problems worse—by defunding the only two voluntary service \nproviders whose sole mission was to find adoptive homes for older and “hard to place” children \nin foster care.  During a March 2015 City Council meeting, Commissioner Carrión stated that the \ndefunding of these two agencies “wasn’t a great loss”.   \n241.  ACS also lacks an effective system for appropriately matching Plaintiff Children \nwith the most appropriate foster placement to meet their needs.  Upon information and belief, \nACS does not assess a child’s safety, health or permanency needs prior to placing the child with \na Contract Agency.  Instead, ACS makes a blind placement decision based on which Contract \nAgency has availability at the time the placement is sought.  Upon information and belief, the \nContract Agency does not assess a child’s safety, health or permanency needs prior to placing the \nchild into a foster placement.  Instead, the Contract Agency makes the determination based on \nwhich foster placement has availability at the time the placement is sought. \n242.  Put simply, ACS fails to ensure that the children in its custody who cannot, or \nwho are least likely to, return home safely are placed in pre-adoptive foster placements that are \nmore likely to turn into permanent adoptive homes.  Instead, ACS places the child with whatever \nContract Agency has availability at the time the placement is sought. \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 83 of 111\n243.  Moreover, ACS also fails to ensure that children who are unlikely to be safely \nreturned to their parents and who will not be adopted by kin or their current foster parent are \nquickly placed with Contract Agencies capable of individually recruiting adoptive parents.   \n244.  As a direct result of these failures, Plaintiff Children frequently are harmed \nbecause they are not placed in the best foster home to meet their safety and permanency needs.  \nACS’s failure to recruit and retain a sufficient number of foster homes and to match children in \nits custody with foster placements that meet their needs substantially departs from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the harm, risk of harm and \nviolations of rights suffered by Plaintiff Children. \nD.  ACS Fails To Ensure that Meaningful Case Plans and Service Plans for Foster \nChildren Are Developed and Implemented.  \n245.  Federal and state law require caseworkers to establish a permanency goal and to \ndevelop a strategic plan for achieving that goal.  This includes establishing a permanency goal, \nengaging in concurrent planning, developing and implementing service plans to promote \nreunification, and recruiting and securing an alternative permanent home for children who cannot \nbe safely returned home. \n246.  According to OCFS’s own standards, caseworkers in New York State should \nestablish a child’s permanency goal within 30 days of the child entering the foster care system.  \nHowever, by OCFS’s own measure, nearly one-third of children entering foster care for the first \ntime do not have a documented permanency goal within 90 days of admission.  \n247.  Federal and state law and policy require caseworkers in New York City to \nconduct concurrent permanency planning as soon as a child is taken into foster care, so that there \nis a primary permanency plan and a secondary permanency plan that caseworkers pursue \nsimultaneously.  ACS fails to ensure that concurrent planning occurs.  Upon information and \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 84 of 111\nbelief, caseworkers do not begin to engage in non-reunification permanency planning until long \nafter it becomes clear that the child’s parents will not be able to safely care for the child. \n248.  As a direct result of these systemic deficiencies, New York City’s foster children \nstay in the system for far too long.  This is no secret to ACS.  ACS has been aware of rampant \ncase planning deficiencies in New York City for years.   \na.  In the 2002 and 2009 CFSRs, the federal government concluded that \nappropriate permanency goals were not established in a timely manner for \nchildren in foster care in New York State.   \nb.  Similarly, the Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in conjunction \nwith ACS in 2009, found that children in ACS custody spent a long time \nin foster care before their permanency goal was changed to adoption, \nalternative permanency options were not adequately explored and \nconcurrent planning was not sufficiently documented.   \n249.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failures (as described in this section) to ensure \nthe provision of meaningful and appropriate case plans, Plaintiff Children frequently grow up in \nACS custody without a permanent home or family to call their own.  ACS’s failure to ensure that \nmeaningful and appropriate case planning occurs substantially departs from accepted \nprofessional judgment and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of harms, \nand violations of legal rights being suffered by Plaintiff Children. \n1.  ACS Fails To Ensure Services Are Provided To Sustain Family Ties and \nSupport Reunification When It Is Safely Possible. \n250.  After a child is removed from home due to abuse or neglect, federal and state law \nand policy dictate that the preferred course of action is to reunify the child with his or her \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 85 of 111\nparents.  Reunification, however, is only appropriate where the reason for removal has been \naddressed through appropriate services to the family so that the child’s safety is assured.  \nHowever, ACS fails to ensure the provision of meaningful case planning and effective services \nto support reunification: \na.  ACS often fails to ensure that Contract Agencies involve parents in case \nplanning and service planning for their children.  In the 2009 CFSR, the \nfederal government found that ACS had adequately assured family \ninvolvement in case and services planning in only 45% of cases—well \nbelow the national standard of 95%.  \nb.  ACS fails to ensure that the reunification services required are adequately \ntailored to ensure that the child in ACS custody can safely be returned \nhome.  Often the services Contract Agencies require and refer parents to \ndo not correspond to the conduct that led to the removal of the child from \nthe home in the first place.  For example, most parents are required to \nattend standardized anger management or parenting classes even though \nneither of those classes offer the particularized support that a parent may \nneed.  Upon information and belief, Contract Agencies do not evaluate \nservices to determine if services better suited to a parent’s needs are \navailable or, if they do, it is not until after the parent has completed \nstandardized classes.  Upon information and belief, Family Court judges \nare often reluctant to return children to their parents where the issue giving \nrise to the initial removal has not been addressed. \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 86 of 111\nc.  ACS fails to ensure that required services are evidence-based and \nrepresent recent innovations in the field.  For example, required mental \nhealth services often do not incorporate trauma-based practice or cognitive \nbehavioral therapy. \nd.   ACS fails to ensure that required services accomplish the purpose they \npurport to—ensuring children in ACS custody can be returned home \nwithin a reasonable period of time.  Upon information and belief, neither \nACS nor the Contract Agencies perform regular evaluations of what \nservices correspond to successful reunifications.   \ne.  ACS fails to ensure efficiency and coordination among multiple service \nproviders, fails to ensure that required services are not duplicative of one \nanother and fails to consider whether it is logistically possible for parents \nto comply with service plans (while also potentially searching for housing \nor employment, or working)—all of which delays children in foster care \nbeing returned to their parents.   \nf.  ACS fails to ensure services are available to parents so that children in \nACS custody can be returned home within a reasonable period of time.  \nContract Agencies frequently require parents to take a certain action or to \nobtain a certain service so that the child in foster care can return home, but \nthat same parent is not provided with critical assistance in taking that \naction or obtaining that service.  For example, many parents are required \nto obtain permanent housing before their children in ACS custody can be \nreturned.  However, ACS fails to provide assistance with completing \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 87 of 111\napplications for public housing or expediting those applications.  When \nmental health services are required, parents find they have no access to \nmental health services in their community or are unable to afford the \nappropriate services. \ng.  ACS also fails to ensure alternative services are available to parents so that \nchildren in ACS custody can be returned home within a reasonable period \nof time.  Upon information and belief, if suitable group classes do not \nexist, Contract Agencies do not seek out alternative arrangements, such as \ntherapy or counseling, to meet a parent’s needs more quickly. \n251.  ACS’s failure to ensure that reunification services are appropriately tailored, \neffective and sufficiently available prevents or delays reunification, even though many parents \ncould resume custody of their children if the proper services were provided consistent with \nfederal and state law and professional standards.  \n252.  These systemic failures have long been known to ACS.  In 2003, the New York \nCity Child Welfare Advisory Panel noted that ACS failed to ensure that parents knew how to get \ninformation about services or other issues, or whether or not someone from ACS or the Contract \nAgency was responsible for ensuring the service plan would be carried out and that services \nwould be provided.  The Long Road Home Study, which was conducted in 2009 in conjunction \nwith ACS, found that substantial numbers of parents did not receive necessary reunification \nservices due to both parents’ lack of participation and casework failures.   \n253.  ACS has failed to address these problems and children in ACS custody have \nsuffered as a direct result.  \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 88 of 111\n2.  ACS Fails To Ensure Timely Adoptions. \n254.  When a child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, federal and state \nlaw require ACS to file a petition to terminate parental rights unless certain compelling \ncircumstances exist and are documented.  ACS has delegated its responsibility to timely file TPR \npetitions to the Contract Agencies.  However, ACS fails to ensure that TPR petitions are timely \nfiled consistent with federal and state law. \n255.  Defendants are well aware of this failure.  In December 2011, ACS reported that \nNew York City was failing to meet federal and state law standards for the overwhelming \nmajority of children in ACS custody.  For FY 2010—the most recent 12-month period for which \nthis data is available—ACS reported that 94.9% of children who had been in ACS custody for \nthe past 18 months did not have a TPR petition filed.   \n256.  ACS’s failure to file TPR petitions in accordance with the time periods set by \nfederal and state law is not a new problem.  In the 2002 CFSR, the federal government reported \nthat in New York State, caseworker turnover, staffing shortages, transfer of cases and \ncaseworkers’ lack of familiarity with cases slowed down the TPR process.  In the 2002 CFSR \nReport, the federal government also reported that delays in Family Court, including “lengthy \nadjournments”, “w[ere] seen as the greatest barrier” to the timely termination of parental rights.  \nIn the 2009 CFSR, the federal government concluded that New York State met federal \nrequirements regarding timely termination of parental rights in only 62% of cases reviewed—far \nless than the 90% required to meet the national standard—and was not consistent in documenting \ncompelling reasons when a termination of parental rights petition was not filed.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the CFSR results for New York State are heavily influenced by New \nYork City’s child welfare system, which accounted for over 60% of children in foster care in \nNew York State in both 2002 and 2009.  \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 89 of 111\n257.  Once both parents’ rights have been either voluntarily surrendered or terminated, \na child is considered “freed” or legally available to be adopted into a permanent home and \nfamily.  New York State regulations require that a child be freed for adoption within 12 months \nof his or her permanency goal changing to adoption. \n258.  However, ACS fails to ensure that children in its custody are freed for adoption \nwithin a reasonable time period.  In New York City, it takes longer for a child in foster care to be \nfreed for adoption than anywhere else in the country.  Based on the most recent federal data \navailable, it takes nearly two times longer to be freed for adoption in New York City than in the \nrest of New York State (42.2 months versus 22.1 months), and 2.5 times longer to be freed for \nadoption in New York City than in the rest of the nation (42.2 months versus 16.8 months).   \n259.  ACS also fails to act on applications from potential adoptive families within the \ntime periods set by state law.   \n260.  When a foster parent or other person wants to adopt a child in foster care in New \nYork City, he or she must submit an application.  By state law, an adoption application must be \nacted upon within six months and such action must be sufficiently documented.   \n261.  Then a potential adoptive parent must undergo an adoption study during which his \nor her fitness to be an adoptive parent is assessed.  Completion of adoption studies are subject to \nstrict timelines under state law.  Priority for completion of an adoption study is determined by \nthe characteristics of the child that the applicant seeks to adopt.  Those who seek to adopt \nchildren with the age, racial and other characteristics of the highest proportion of children \nwaiting to be adopted are given first priority.  Second priority is given to those who seek to adopt \nphoto-listed children.  All other applicants are given third priority.  For applicants with first \npriority, an adoption study should be offered within 30 days.  An adoption study must be \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 90 of 111\ncompleted within four months of initiation, subject to appropriate documentation of an \nexception.   \n262.  When a foster parent applies to adopt a child, the adoption study must be \ncompleted within two months of application when the child is legally free for adoption or within \nfour months of application when the child is not legally free for adoption. \n263.  Pursuant to state law, ACS must place a child who has been legally freed for \nadoption in an adoptive home within six months, or document an appropriate exception.  State \nlaw also requires that adoptions be finalized within 12 months of the child placement in an \nadoptive home.   \n264.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies comply \nwith the timelines set by state law for conducting adoption studies and acting on adoption \napplications. \n265.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that applications to become an \nadoptive parent are acted upon within six months as required by state law.   \n266.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies offer to \ncomplete adoption studies within six months.  \n267.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies offer to \ninitiate adoption studies for those with first priority within 30 days. \n268.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within four months of beginning the study or that an exception is \nappropriately documented. \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 91 of 111\n269.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within two months of an application by a foster parent to adopt a child \nwho is legally freed for adoption. \n270.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies \ncomplete adoption studies within four months of an application by a foster parent to adopt a child \nwho is not legally freed for adoption. \n271.  Upon information and belief, ACS fails to ensure that Contract Agencies place \nchildren who have been legally freed for adoption into adoptive homes within six months, or that \nan exception is appropriately documented. \n272.  ACS fails to ensure that children in its custody have finalized adoptions within 12 \nmonths of the child being placed in an adoptive home, as required by state law.  In September \n2012, ACS reported that 72% of children did not have finalized adoptions within 12 months of \nbeing placed in an adoptive home.7   \n273.  Defendants’ failures to ensure that Contract Agencies process adoption \napplications, conduct adoption studies, place children in adoptive homes and finalize adoptions \nwithin the time periods set by state law further delays providing these children in ACS custody—\nwho likely have already been in foster care for many months or even years—with a permanent \nhome and family.   \n                                                 \n7 517 of the 1,825 children (28%) in adoptive placements on March 31, 2011 were adopted within 12 months \nof being adoptively placed. \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 92 of 111\nE.  Defendants Fail To Ensure Timely Adjudication of Family Court Proceedings \nInvolving Children in Foster Care. \n274.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that Family Court proceedings are adjudicated in a \ntimely fashion consistent with state law contributes significantly to the length of time New York \nCity children spend in foster care without permanent homes and families. \n275.  State law requires that a child who is placed into foster care have a permanency \nhearing within eight months of being placed into foster care and every six months thereafter.  \nThat hearing must be completed within 30 days.  The purpose of permanency hearings is to \nmonitor the child’s safety and well-being, the family’s progress, and efforts to return the child \nhome or to find the child another permanent home.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail \nto ensure that all children in ACS custody receive timely permanency hearings as required by \nstate law.   \n276.  The Long Road Home Study, which was prepared in 2009 in conjunction with \nACS, detailed the following findings with respect to delays in Family Court proceedings \ninvolving children in ACS custody: \na.  The length of time between a child’s entry into foster care and the Family \nCourt’s completion of the fact-finding and disposition hearings was \nextremely long for many children; \nb.  Many children in ACS custody do not receive timely permanency hearings \nas required by state law; \nc.  The most common reasons for permanency hearing delays were that the \nContract Agency had not submitted the permanency hearing report on \ntime, that the Family Court did not have sufficient time for the hearing, \nthat Contract Agency caseworkers were not present, that the permanency \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 93 of 111\nhearing report did not sufficiently address the issues in the case, and that \nACS caseworkers were not present; and \nd.  Termination of parental rights proceedings were extremely delayed for \nmost children. \nAdditionally, the study noted that the number of adjournments and the length of time between \nadjournments of all types of Family Court proceedings contribute to children’s lengthy stays in \nfoster care in New York City.  The published study stated: \n“[T]he Court gives ACS and the [Contract Agencies] many \nchances (and multiple hearing adjournments) to present evidence \nand provide necessary services to parents, even after they have \nbeen slow and negligent in doing so.” \nFinally, the study found that a lack of accountability in Family Court proceedings contributes to \ndelays in placing children in ACS custody into permanent homes and families, stating: \n“The Court’s decision-making is hampered by poor-quality \ncasework by ACS and the [Contract Agencies].  The Court \ndepends on ACS and the [Contract Agencies] to provide \nappropriate services to children and families and to inform the \nCourt’s decision-making through assessments of the children’s \nprogress toward permanency . . . [J]udges and referees expressed \nfrustration with the quality of the agencies’ case practices – and the \nfact that many caseworkers seem to see their role as only \ndocumenting parents’ attendance at services rather than providing \nthe Court with clinical assessments of parents’ progress.  In \naddition . . . the parties infrequently make applications or motions \nto the Court for relief to address pressing issues and try to move \ncases forward.”   \n277.  In 2010, the New York County Lawyers’ Association Task Force on the Family \nCourt released a report recognizing two causes for delay in Family Court:  (1) a shortage of \nFamily Court judges and (2) a culture of delay.  The Task Force made a number of \nrecommendations to minimize delay and enhance the effectiveness of litigation, including:  \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 94 of 111\na.  scheduling trials where a child has been removed within 45 days of the \nfirst appearance; \nb.  requiring compliance with timely production and filing of documents, as \nwell as attendance at status and trial conferences;  \nc.  scheduling times certain for trial conferences; \nd.  holding trials in block times on consecutive days; \ne.  refraining from adjourning trials for more than 30 days, and then only for \ngood cause shown; and \nf.  disciplining attorneys and other personnel who are unprepared, late or fail \nto appear. \n278.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that ACS and Contract Agency attorneys and \ncaseworkers are appropriately staffed with caseloads consistent with professional standards and \ngiven necessary support further contributes to delays in Family Court proceedings.   \n279.  Upon information and belief, delays continue to plague the vast majority of \nFamily Court proceedings involving children in ACS custody in New York City. \n280.  Defendants’ failures result in delays in Family Court proceedings involving \nchildren in ACS custody in New York City and include: \na.  the State’s failure to ensure adequate judicial resources are devoted to \nFamily Court in New York City; \nb.  the State’s failure to provide Family Court judges in New York City with \nsufficient resources, including referees or law clerks with social work \nexperience; \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 95 of 111\nc.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that ACS and Contract Agency attorneys and \ncaseworkers have caseloads consistent with professional standards; \nd.  ACS’s failure to ensure that attorneys and caseworkers appear at all \nFamily Court proceedings prepared; \ne.  ACS’s failure to ensure that attorneys and caseworkers do not request \nadjournments absent good cause shown; \nf.  ACS’s failure to ensure that necessary paperwork is prepared in \naccordance with reasonable professional standards and submitted to the \nFamily Court in a timely fashion; and \ng.  ACS’s failure to ensure that caseworkers are trained to give the Court \ndetailed assessments of children and parents’ progress in accordance with \nreasonable professional standards. \n281.  A three- or six-month adjournment is a long time to a child in ACS custody who \nis struggling with the uncertainty and emotional harm of not knowing if or when he or she will \nbe moved again and of not having a permanent home and family to call his or her own.  \nDefendants have an obligation to ensure that all service providers, including caseworkers and \nattorneys, recognize the urgency of Family Court proceedings for Plaintiff Children, who are \nlanguishing in ACS custody. \n282.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that all reasonable efforts are \nmade to ensure the timely adjudication of Family Court proceedings involving children in its \ncustody, Plaintiff Children suffer harm by being forced to grow up in ACS custody rather than in \na permanent home.  Defendants’ failures substantially depart from reasonable professional \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 96 of 111\nstandards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the harms, risk of harms and violations of \nlegal rights suffered by Plaintiff Children.   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Substantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children against Defendants) \n283.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n284.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution to provide reasonable care to and to protect from harm a child it has \ntaken into its foster care custody. \n285.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants City of New York, ACS, \nGladys Carrión, in her official capacity, State of New York, OCFS and Sheila J. Poole, in her \nofficial capacity, constitute a policy, pattern, practice or custom that is inconsistent with the \nexercise of accepted professional judgment and amounts to deliberate indifference to the \nconstitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all Named Plaintiff Children and \nPlaintiff Children.  As a result, all Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children have been, \nand are at risk of being, deprived of substantive due process rights conferred upon them by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n286.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment while in foster care; \nb.  the right to protection from unnecessary intrusions into the child’s \nemotional well-being while in government custody; \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 97 of 111\nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions into the child’s emotional well-being while in government \ncustody; \nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody;  \ne.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and \nassumptions of government custody; and \nf.  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children against Defendants) \n287.

As a direct result of the City Defendants’ failure to comply with New York State \nSocial Services Law and regulations adopted thereto, the Office of the Public Advocate has been \nforced to expend resources investigating and responding to complaints.  The Defendants’ \ncontinued failure to adhere to the provisions of the law will result in the expenditure of similar \nresources in the future. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Common Law Contract) \n(Asserted by the Named Plaintiff Children, Plaintiff Children and the Public Advocate \nagainst the City Defendants) \n295.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n296.  The Agreements for the purchase of foster care services between ACS and the \nContract Agencies constitute valid, binding and enforceable contracts.8   \n297.  The Public Advocate is a member of New York’s City Council (the “Council”).  \nCharter of the City of New York, Chapter 2 § 22.  The Council is charged with reviewing “on a \nregular and continuous basis the activities of the agencies of the city, including their service \ngoals and performance and management efficiency.”  Charter of the City of New York, Chapter \n2 § 29(a)(2).  Further, the Council is charged with overseeing “patterns of contractual spending \nby city agencies” and “procedures for evaluating contractor performance.”  Charter of the City of \nNew York, Chapter 2 § 30(2), (4). \n298.  Under the terms of the Agreements, ACS pays hundreds of millions of dollars to \nContract Agencies that agree to “provide comprehensive family foster care services as set forth \n                                                 \n8 To the best of our information and belief, the Agreements, which are listed in Appendix A, were current as of \nNovember 2014 (see ¶ 119) and are still in force today.  Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a copy of an excerpt of one \nsuch Agreement between ACS and a Contract Agency, which has been modified to include the relevant portion of \nthe Agreement.  The Agreements are substantively identical from Contract Agency to Contract Agency, with the \nexception of the contracting parties and the contract amount.   \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 103 of 111\nin this Agreement, the Law, court orders and mandates, ACS Policies, the Fiscal Manual”9 and \nseveral appendices to each Agreement.  Agreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster \nCare Services Part II, Section 2.01(A) (General Requirements). \n299.  Under the terms of the Agreement—and by law—the management and \nsupervisory staff of ACS, on behalf of the Commissioner of ACS, “has the ultimate \nresponsibility for the protection and preservation of the welfare of each child receiving services”, \nand “has the ultimate authority for making all decisions relative to the welfare of such child”.  \nAgreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster Care Services Part II, Section 4.01(A) \n(Responsibility and Authority of ACS and Procedure for Final Decisions on Issues Related to \nServices Provided to the Client). \n300.  City Defendants have breached and failed to enforce the Agreements, which were \nintended for the benefit of the Named Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children, and over which \nthe Public Advocate has oversight.   \n301.  The Agreements state that “ACS and the Contractor agree that the fundamental \npurpose of [the] Agreement is to provide the best available services, care and treatment to Foster \nChildren who are entrusted to the Contractors care, and further ensure that the health, welfare \nand fundamental rights of the Foster Children shall be the guiding principle for all decisions \nwhich affect their lives”.  Agreement for the Purchase of Regular Family Foster Care Services \nPart II, Section 4.01(B) (Responsibility and Authority of ACS and Procedure for Final Decisions \non Issues Related to Services Provided to the Client). \n302.  As a direct and causal result of City Defendants’ breach of the Agreements, the \nNamed Plaintiff Children and Plaintiff Children have been harmed.   \n                                                 \n9 This language may differ to account for the type of foster placement services provided for in the Agreement \nbut, in substance, the provisions are identical. \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 104 of 111\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff Children respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na.

Pursuant to Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, declare \nunconstitutional and unlawful: \n1.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s right to be free from \nharm under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution;  \n2.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the First, \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; \n3.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Action of 1980, as \namended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, \n42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.;  \n4.  City Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under New \nYork Social Services Law and regulations adopted thereto; and \n5.  City Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the \nAgreements with the Contract Agencies. \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 105 of 111\nd.

Enjoin City Defendants from placing children with Contract \nAgencies that do not maintain caseloads for all workers providing \ndirect supervision and planning for children that conform to \naccepted professional standards, as developed by either the COA \nand/or the CWLA, or a workload analysis conducted by ACS.  \nRequire that ACS independently and periodically verify that every \nContract Agency meets and maintains the applicable caseload \nstandards and its verification process and that the results shall be \npublic information. \n2.  Require City Defendants to develop a process for matching \nchildren with Contract Agencies that takes into account the child’s \nneed for permanence, the child’s service needs, and the Agency’s \ndemonstrated ability to provide timely permanence for children, \nand timely and necessary individualized services for children and \nfamilies based on timelines set by ACS in accordance with federal \nand state law and accepted professional standards.  Require that \nACS independently and periodically verify that each Contract \nAgency meets and maintains the applicable standards set by ACS \nand its verification process and that the results shall be public \ninformation.  \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 106 of 111\n3.

Enjoin ACS from placing children in any Contract Agency unless \nat least 90% of the case plans for children currently placed with the \nAgency (a) meet federal requirements (as set forth in \n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)) and accepted professional \nstandards as set by COA and/or CWLA, (b) are created in a timely \nfashion pursuant to applicable regulations and (c) are implemented \nconsistent with professional standards.  Require that ACS \nindependently and periodically verify that each Contract Agency \nwith which ACS places children meets such standards, and their \nverification process and that the results shall be public information. \n5.  Enjoin ACS from placing children with any Contract Agency \nunless the Agency has demonstrated, and ACS has ascertained, \nthat it conducts permanency planning, including concurrent \nplanning, that it has the resources to provide individualized and \neffective reunification services and that it has the resources to \ndevelop and implement individualized adoptive recruitment for \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 107 of 111\nchildren whose permanency goal is adoption.

Require that ACS \nindependently and periodically verify that each Contract Agency \nwith which it places children shall meet these standards, and rank \nthe agencies in their effectiveness in doing so.  Require that their \nverification process and the results, including the Contract Agency \nrankings, shall be public information. \n6.  Require that ACS develop and fund post-permanency services of \nsufficient duration to provide all possible support for the successful \nreunification, guardianship or adoption of foster children. \n7.  Require that ACS ensure that its attorneys and attorneys employed \nby the Contract Agencies take all reasonable steps necessary \n(including not seeking adjournments except in extraordinary \ncircumstances) to proceed to the adjudication and disposition in \nArticle 10 proceedings within three months and, when a \ntermination of parental rights process is necessary, to proceed to a \ndisposition of that proceeding within four months of the petition \nbeing filed.  Require that ACS collect and maintain detailed \ninformation on this, which shall be public record. \n8.  Require that City and State Defendants regularly collect and \nindependently verify the information necessary to determine the \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05273   Document 1   Filed 07/08/15   Page 108 of 111\nContract Agencies’ compliance with the provisions of the state \nstatutes and regulations enumerated in paragraph 293 above and \nprovide public reports of each Agency’s compliance with each of \nthese requirements.

Require that OCFS conduct annual case record reviews of a \nstatistically significant sample of children in ACS custody to \nmeasure the degree to which children in ACS custody are receiving \ntimely permanence, as required by state and federal law, and the \ndegree to which they are being maltreated in care; issue annual \npublic reports on the findings of these case record reviews; and  \nrequire corrective action when necessary.   \n10.

(Pines, Jonathan) (Entered: 06/08/2016) \n06/09/2016  175   ORDER granting in part and denying in part 171 Letter Motion for \nExtension of Time. The City defendants' application for an extension of \ntime to respond to plaintiffs' first request for the production of documents \nand first set of interrogatories is granted in part and denied in part. I \nappreciate that there are multiple deadlines coming up in this matter, but \nI also appreciate that the Law Department is fortunate to have a large \nnumber of talented attorneys. According to its web site, the Law \nDepartment has approximately 730 attorneys and 690 \"support \nprofessionals\" -- far more professional and paraprofessional personnel \nthan most metropolitan law firms. The City defendants' current \napplication does not disclose how many attorneys it currently has \nassigned to this matter or nor does it explain why it is unable to assign \nmore attorneys to work on this matter. I conclude that the proposed \nschedule set forth in plaintiffs' June 8 letter is generally reasonable and \nadopt it with a slight, 7-day adjustment. The City defendants are to \nrespond to the discovery requests to which they are asserting only general \nobjections no later than July 1, 2016 (a 22-day extension). For those \ndiscovery request for which the City defendants do not have general \nobjections, the City defendants are to respond no later than July 21, 2016; \nto the extent that the City defendants are producing documents in \nresponse to plaintiffs' discovery requests, the documents are also to be \nproduced by July 21, 2016.

(North, Julie) (Entered: 08/16/2016) \n08/16/2016  264   ORDER denying 260 Letter Motion to Stay. The City Defendants' \napplication to stay discovery is denied. Judge Swain's comments \nconcerning the adequacy of plaintiffs' counsel's investigation of the \nparticular circumstances of the named plaintiff children and counsel's \nassessment of the named plaintiff children's claims were all made in the \ncontext of the motion to approve the settlement with the State Defendants \nand, in particular, were addressing the issue of whether the settlement \nwas reached after meaningful discovery. Judge Swain was not asked to \naddress whether \"the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions [in the \namended complaint were] warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous \nargument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law\" or whether \n\"the factual contentions [in the amended complaint] have evidentiary \nsupport or.. will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable \nopportunity for further investigation or discovery....\" Fed.R.Civ. P. 11 (b) \n(2), (3). In short, Judge Swain was not assessing whether there was a \nviolation of the Rule 11(b)'s implied certifications, and the City \nDefendants' attempt to contort her words into a finding of a Rule 11 \nviolation divorces the words from the context in which they were made. \nWhether counsel's discovery and investigation is sufficient to justify \napproval of a class action settlement is a different, more demanding \ninquiry than whether counsel's pre-suit investigation satisfied Rule 11. It \n\nis also noteworthy that the City Defendants, who have substantial \nknowledge of the named plaintiff children's circumstances and the \nallegations made in the amended complaint, have never even suggested \nthat the amended complaint was so baseless that Rule 11 sanctions were \nwarranted. The fact that the City Defendants never commenced the \nprocedures set forth in Rule 11(c) that must precede a motion for Rule 11 \nsanctions casts doubt on the veracity of their newly asserted arguments. I \nappreciate that the City Defendants deny plaintiffs' material allegations. \nNevertheless, in the absence of a showing that the allegations in the \namended complaint were asserted in bad faith and were utterly baseless \nin law and fact, there is no basis for the stay of discovery sought by the \nCity Defendants. The annexed application is, therefore, denied. (Signed \nby Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman on 8/16/2016) Copies Sent By \nChambers.
