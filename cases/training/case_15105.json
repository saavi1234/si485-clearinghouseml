Fortner, 455 F.3d 752 (7th Cir. 2006), it is wholly inappropriate for an appellee's lawyer to wait until a brief is due, file a motion in lieu of a brief, and ask for extra time to file a brief if the motion is denied. Such a procedure demands the time of six appellate judges (three on the motions panel, three on the merits panel) instead of three. There is no reason for an expedited decision in this case. To prevent further dissipation of judicial time, the court also denied the request for additional time to file a brief. The motion for summary affirmance will be treatedÂ asÂ the brief of appellee Village of Glendale Heights, and the case will be submitted for decision without further briefing by the Village.

Pickering, Appellant,\nv. On Appeal From the\nBoard of Education of Township Supreme Court of\nHigh School District 205, Illinois.\nWill County, Illinois.\n[June 3, 1968.]\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part.\nThe Court holds that truthful statements by a school\nteacher critical of the school board are within the ambit\nof the First Amendment. So also are false statements\ninnocently or negligently made. The State may not fire\nthe teacher for making either unless, as I gather it, there\nare special circumstances, not present in this case, dem-\nonstrating an overriding state interest, such as the need\nfor confidentiality or the special obligations which a\nteacher in a particular position may owe to his superiors.'\nThe core of today's decision is the holding that Picker-\ning's discharge must be tested by the standard of New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964). To\nthis extent I am in agreement.\n1See ante, at 6-7, 9 and nn. 3, 4. The Court does not elaborate\nupon its suggestion that there may be situations in which, with\nreference to certain areas of public comment, a teacher may have\nspecial obligations to his superiors. It simply holds that in this\ncase, with respect to the particular public comment made by Pick-\nering, he is more like a member of the general public and, appar-\nently, too remote from the school board to require placing him into\nany special category. Further, as I read the Court's opinion, it does\nnot foreclose the possibility that under the First Amendment a school\nsystem may have an enforceable rule, applicable to teachers, that\npublic statements about school business must first be submitted to.\nthe authorities to check for accuracy.\n\n510—CONCUR & DISSENT\n2 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nThe Court goes on, however, to reopen a question I\nhad thought settled by New York Times and the cases\nthat followed it, particularly Garrison v. Louisiana, 379\nU. S. 64 (1964). The Court devotes several pages to re-\nexamining the facts in order to reject the determination\nbelow that Pickering's statements harmed the school\nsystem, ante, at 7-9, when the question of harm is clearly\nirrelevant given the Court's determination that Picker-\ning's statements were neither knowingly nor recklessly\nfalse and its ruling that in such circumstances a teacher\nmay not be fired even if the statements are injurious.\nThe Court then gratuitously suggests that when state-\nments are found to be knowingly or recklessly false, it\nis an open question whether the First Amendment still\nprotects them unless they are shown or can be presumed\nto have caused harm. Ante, at 11, n. 6. Deliberate or\nreckless falsehoods serve no First Amendment ends and\ndeserve no protection under that Amendment. The\nCourt unequivocally recognized this in Garrison, where\nafter reargument the Court said that \"the knowingly\nfalse statement and the statement made with reckless\ndisregard of the truth, do not. enjoy constitutional pro-\ntection.\" 379 U. S., at 75. The Court today neither\nexplains nor justifies its withdrawal from the firm stand\ntaken in Garrison. As I see it, a teacher may be fired\nwithout violation of the First Amendment for knowingly\nor recklessly making false statements regardless of their\nharmful impact on the schools. As the Court holds,\nhowever, in the absence of special circumstances he may\nnot be fired if his statements were true or only negligently\nfalse, even if there is some harm to the school system.\nI therefore see no basis or necessity for the Court's foray\ninto factfinding with respect to whether the record sup-\nports a finding as to injury.' If Pickering's false state-\n2 Even if consideration of harm were necessary in this case, I\ncould not join the Court in concluding on this record that harm to\nthe school administration was not proved and could not be presumed.\n\n510—CONCUR & DISSENT\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 3\nments were either knowingly or recklessly made, injury\nto the school system becomes irrelevant, and the First\nAmendment would not prevent his discharge. For the\nState to be constitutionally precluded from terminating\nhis employment, reliance on some other constitutional\nprovision would be required.\nNor can I join the Court in its findings with regard to\nwhether Pickering knowingly or recklessly published false\nstatements. Neither the State in presenting its evidence\nnor the state tribunals in arriving at their findings and\nconclusions of law addressed themselves to the elements\nof the new standard which the Court holds the First\nAmendment to require in the circumstances of this case.\nIndeed, the state courts expressly rejected the appli-\ncability of both New York Times and Garrison. I find\nit wholly unsatisfactory for this Court to make the initial\ndetermination of knowing or reckless falsehood from the\ncold record now before us. It would be far more appro-\npriate to remand this case to the state courts for further\nproceedings in light of the constitutional standard which\nthe Court deems applicable to this case, once the relevant\nfacts have been ascertained in appropriate proceedings.",

      "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 510.-OCTOBER TERM, 1967.\nMarvin L. Pickering, Appellant,\nv. On Appeal From the\nBoard of Education of Township Supreme Court of\nHigh School District 205, Illinois.\nWill County, Illinois.\n[June 3, 1968.]\nMR. JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\nAppellant Marvin L. Pickering, a teacher in Township\nHigh School District 205, Will County, Illinois, was dis-\nmissed from his position by the appellee Board of Edu-\ncation for sending a letter to a local newspaper in con-\nnection with a recently proposed tax increase that was\ncritical of the way in which the Board and the district\nsuperintendent of schools had handled past proposals to\nraise new revenue for the schools. Appellant's dismissal\nresulted from a determination by the Board, after a full\nhearing, that the publication of the letter was \"detri-\nmental to the efficient operation and administration of\nthe schools of the district\" and hence, under the rele-\nvant Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, c. 122,\n§ 10-22.4, that \"interests of the school require[d] [his\ndismissal].\"\nAppellant's claim that his writing of the letter was\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was\nrejected. Appellant then sought review of the Board's\naction in the Circuit Court of Will County, which affirmed\nhis dismissal on the ground that the determination that\nappellant's letter was detrimentral to the interests of the\nschool system was supported by substantial evidence and\nthat the interests of the schools overrode appellant's First\nAmendment rights. On appeal, the Supreme Court of\n\n510—OPINION\n2 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nIllinois, two Justices dissenting, affirmed the judgment\nof the Circuit Court. 36 Ill. 2d 568, 225 N. E. 2d 1\n(1966). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellant's\nclaim that the Illinois statute permitting his dismissal\non the facts of this case was unconstitutional as applied\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments.' 389 U. S.\n925 (1967). For the reasons detailed below we agree\nthat appellant's rights to freedom of speech were violated\nand we reverse.\nI.\nIn February of 1961 the  appellee Board of Education\nasked the voters of the school district to approve a bond\nissue to raise $4,875,000 to erect two new schools. The\nproposal was defeated. Then, in December of 1961, the\nBoard submitted another bond proposal to the voters\nwhich called for the raising of $5,500,000 to build two\nnew schools. This second proposal passed and the\nschools were built with the money raised by the bond\nsales. In May of 1964 a proposed increase in the tax\nrate to be used for educational purposes was submitted\nto the voters by the Board and was defeated. Finally,\non September 19, 1964, a second proposal to increase the\ntax rate was submitted by the Board and was likewise\ndefeated. It was in connection with this last proposal\nof the School Board that appellant wrote the letter to the\neditor (which we reproduce in an Appendix to this opin-\nion) that resulted in his dismissal.\nPrior to the vote on the second tax increase proposal\na variety of articles attributed to the District 205\nTeachers' Organization appeared in the local paper.\n1 Appellant also challenged the statutory standard on which the\nBoard based his dismissal as vague and overbroad. See Keyishian\nv. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967) ; NAACP v. Button,\n371 U. S. 415 (1963) ; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479 (1960).\nBecause of our disposition of this case we do not reach appellant's\nchallenge to the statute on its face.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 3\nThese articles urged passage of the tax increase and stated\nthat failure to pass the increase would result in a decline\nin the quality of education afforded children in the dis-\ntrict's schools. A letter from the superintendent of\nschools making the same point was published in the\npaper two days before the election and submitted to the\nvoters in mimeographed form the following day. It was\nin response to the foregoing material, together with the\nfailure of the tax increase to pass, that appellant sub-\nmitted the letter in question to the editor of the local\npaper.\nThe letter constituted, basically, an attack on the school\nboard's handling of the 1961 bond issue proposals and its\nsubsequent allocation of financial resources between the\nschools' educational and athletic programs. It also\ncharged the superintendent of schools with attempting\nto prevent teachers in the district from opposing or criti-\ncizing the proposed bond issue.\nThe Board dismissed Pickering for writing and pub-\nlishing the letter. Pursuant to Illinois law, the Board\nwas then required to hold a hearing on the dismissal.\nAt the hearing the Board charged that numerous state-\nments in the letter were false and that the publication\nof the statements unjustifiably impugned the \"motives,\nhonesty, integrity, truthfulness, responsibility and com-\npetence\" of both the Board and the school administration.\nThe Board also charged that the false statements dam-\naged the professional reputations of its members and\nof the school administrators, would be disruptive of\nfaculty discipline, and would tend to foment \"contro-\nversy, conflict and dissension\" among teachers, admin-\nistrators, the Board of Education, and the residents of\nthe district. Testimony was introduced from a variety\nof witnesses on the truth or falsity of the particular state-\nments in the letter with which the Board took issue. The\nBoard found the statements to be false as charged. No,\n\n510—OPINION\n4 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nevidence was introduced at any point in the proceedings\nas to the effect of the publication of the letter on the\ncommunity as a whole or on the administration of the\nschool system in particular, and no specific findings along\nthese lines were made.\nThe Illinois courts reviewed the proceedings solely to\ndetermine whether the Board's findings were supported\nby substantial evidence and whether, on the facts as\nfound, the Board could reasonably conclude that appel-\nlant's publication of the letter was \"detrimental to the\nbest interests of the schools.\" Pickering's claim that his\nletter was protected by the First Amendment was re-\njected on the ground that his acceptance of a teaching\nposition in the public schools obliged him to refrain from\nmaking statements about the operation of the schools\n\"which in the absence of such position he would have\nan undoubted right to engage in.\" It is not altogether\nclear whether the Illinois Supreme Court held that the\nFirst Amendment had no applicability to appellant's dis-\nmissal for writing the letter in question or whether it\ndetermined that the particular statements made in the\nletter were not entitled to First Amendment protection.\nIn any event, it clearly rejected Pickering's claim that,\non the facts of this case, he could not constitutionally\nbe dismissed from his teaching position.\nTo the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion\nmay be read to suggest that teachers may constitutionally\nbe compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights\nthey would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on\nmatters of public interest in connection with the opera-\ntion of the public schools in which they work, it proceeds\non a premise that has been unequivocally rejected in\nnumerous prior decisions of this Court. E. g., Wieman\nv. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 (1952); Shelton v. Tucker,\n\n510—OP1NION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 5\n364 U. S. 479 (1960) ; Keyishian v. Board of Regents,.\n385 U. S. 589 (1967). \"[T]he theory that public em-\nployment which may be denied altogether may be sub-\njected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable,\nhas been uniformly rejected.\" Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents, supra, at 605-606. At the same time it cannot\nbe gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer\nin regulating the speech of its employees that differ sig-\nnificantly from those it possesses in connection with reg-\nulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The\nproblem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the\ninterests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon\nmatters of public concern and the interest of the State,\nas an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public\nservices it performs through its employees.\nThe Board contends that \"the teacher by virtue of his\npublic employment has a duty of loyalty to support his\nsuperiors in attaining the generally accepted goals of\neducation and that, if he must speak out publicly, he\nshould do so factually and accurately, commensurate with\nhis education and experience.\" Appellant, on the other\nhand, argues that the test applicable to defamatory state-\nments directed against public officials by persons having\nno occupational relationship with them, namely, that\nstatements to be legally actionable must be made \"with\nknowledge that [they were] . . . false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether [they were] . . . false or not,\" New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 280 (1964),\nshould also be applied to public statements made by\nteachers. Because of the enormous variety of fact situa-\ntions in which critical statements by teachers and other\npublic employees may be thought by their superiors,\nagainst whom the statements are directed, to furnish\ngrounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appro--\n\n510—OPINION\n6 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\npriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general stand-\nard against which all such statements may be judged.\nHowever, in the course of evaluating the conflicting\nclaims of First Amendment protection and the need for\norderly school administration in the context of this case,\nwe shall indicate some of the general lines along which\nan analysis of the controlling interests should run.\nAn examination of the statements in appellant's letter\n2 \nobjected to by the Board  reveals that they, like the\nletter as a whole, consist essentially of criticism of the\nBoard's allocation of school funds between educational\nand athletic programs, and of both the Board's and the\nsuperintendent's methods of informing, or preventing the\ninforming of, the district's taxpayers of the real reasons\nwhy additional tax revenues were being sought for the\nschools. The statements are in no way directed towards\nany person with whom appellant would normally be in\ncontact in the course of his daily work as a teacher.\nThus no question of maintaining either discipline by\nimmediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is pre-\nsented here. Appellant's employment relationships with\nthe Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the\nsuperintendent are not the kind of close working rela-\ntionships for which it can persuasively be claimed that\npersonal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their\nproper functioning. Accordingly, to the extent that the\nBoard's position here can be taken to suggest that even\ncomments on matters of public concern that are substan-\ntially correct, such as statements (1)–(4) of appellant's\nletter, see Appendix, infra, may furnish grounds for\n= We have set out in the Appendix our detailed analysis of the\nspecific statements in appellant's letter which the Board found to.\nbe false, together with our reasons for concluding that several of the\nstatements were, contrary to the findings of the Board, substantially\ncorrect.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 7\ndismissal if they are sufficiently critical in tone, we\nunequivocally reject it.3\nWe next consider the statements in appellant's letter\nwhich we agree to be false. The Board's original charges\nincluded allegations that the publication of the letter\ndamaged the professional reputations of the Board and\nthe superintendent and would foment controversy and\nconflict among the Board, teachers, administrators, and\nthe residents of the district. However, no evidence to\nsupport these allegations was introduced at the hearing.\nSo far as the record reveals, Pickering's letter was greeted\nby everyone but its main target, the Board, with massive\napathy and total disbelief. The Board must, therefore,\nhave decided, perhaps by analogy with the law of libel.\nthat the statements were per se harmful to the operation\nof the schools.\nHowever, the only way in which the Board could\nconclude, absent any evidence of the actual effect of\nthe letter, that the statements contained therein were\nper se detrimental to the interest of the schools was\nto equate the Board members' own interests with that\nof the schools. Certainly an accusation that too much\nmoney is being spent on athletics by the administrators\nof the school system (which is precisely the import of\nthat portion of appellant's letter containing the state-\nments that we have found to be false, see Appendix, infra)\nIt is possible to conceive of some positions in public employment.\nin which the need for confidentiality is so great that even completely\ncorrect public statements might furnish a permissible ground for\ndismissal. Likewise, positions in public employment in which the-\nrelationship between superior and subordinate is of such a personal\nand intimate nature that certain forms of public criticism of the\nsuperior by the subordinate would seriously undermine the effective-\nness of the working relationship between them can also be imagined.\nWe intimate no views as to how we would resolve any specific-\ninstances of such situations, but merely note that significantly dif-\nferent considerations would be involved in such cases.\n\n510—OPINION\n8 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ncannot reasonably be regarded as per se detrimental\nto the district's schools. Such an accusation reflects\nrather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the\nBoard as to the preferable manner of operating the school\nsystem, a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an\nissue of general public interest.\nIn addition, the fact that particular illustrations of\nthe Board's claimed undesirable emphasis on athletic\nprograms are false would not normally have any neces-\nsary impact on the actual operation of the schools, beyond\nits tendency to anger the Board. For example, Picker-\ning's letter was written after the defeat at the polls of the\nsecond proposed tax increase. It could, therefore, have\nhad no effect on the ability of the school district to raise\nnecessary revenue, since there was no showing that there\nwas any proposal to increase taxes pending when the\nletter was written.\nMore importantly, the question whether a school sys-\ntem requires additional funds is a matter of legitimate\npublic concern on which the judgment of the school ad-\nministration, including the School Board, cannot, in a\nsociety that leaves such questions to popular vote, be\ntaken as conclusive. On such a question free and open\ndebate is vital to informed decision-making by the elec-\ntorate. Teachers are, as a class, the members of a com-\nmunity most likely to have informed and definite opin-\nions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the\nschools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that\nthey be able to speak out freely on such questions with-\nout fear of retaliatory dismissal.\nIn addition, the amounts expended on athletics which\nPickering reported erroneously were matters of public\nrecord on which his position as a teacher in the district\ndid not qualify him to speak with any greater authority\nthan any other taxpayer. The Board could easily have\nrebutted appellant's errors by publishing the accurate\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 9\nfigures itself, either via a letter to the same newspaper\nor otherwise. We are thus not presented with a situation\nin which a teacher has carelessly made false statements\nabout matters so closely related to the day-to-day opera-\ntions of the schools that any harmful impact on the'\npublic would be difficult to counter because of the\nteacher's presumed greater access to the real facts. Ac-\ncordingly, we have no occasion to consider at this time,\nwhether under such circumstances a school board could\nreasonably require that a teacher make substantial efforts\nto verify the accuracy of his charges before publishing\nthem.4\nWhat we do have before us is a case in which a teacher'\nhas made erroneous public statements upon issues then\ncurrently the subject of public attention, which are criti-\ncal of his ultimate employer but which are neither shown\nnor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded\nthe teacher's proper performance of his daily duties in\nthe classroom 5 or to have interfered with the regular\noperation of the schools generally. In these circum-\nstances we conclude that the interest of the school ad-\nministration in limiting teachers' opportunities to con-\ntribute to public debate is not significantly greater than\nits interest in limiting a similar contribution by any\nmember of the general public.\n4 There is likewise no occasion furnished by this case for consid-\neration of the extent to which teachers can be required by narrowly\ndrawn grievance procedures to submit complaints about the operation\nof the schools to their superiors for action thereon prior to bringing\nthe complaints before the public.\n5 We also note that this case does not present a situation in which\na teacher's public statements are so without foundation as to call\ninto question his fitness to perform his duties in the classroom. In\nsuch a case, of course, the statements would merely be evidence of\nthe teacher's general competence, or lack thereof, and not an inde-\npendent basis for dismissal.\n\n510—OPINION\n10 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nThe public interest in having free and unhindered\ndebate on matters of public importance—the core value\nof the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment—is\nso great that it has been held that a State cannot au-\nthorize the recovery of damages by a public official for\ndefamatory statements directed at him except when such\nstatements are shown to have been made either with\nknowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for\ntheir truth or falsity. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U. S. 254 (1964); St. Amant v. Thompson, (cid:9) U. S.\n— (1968). Compare Linn v. United Plant Guard\nWorkers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966). The same test has been\napplied to suits for invasion of privacy based on false\nstatements where a \"matter of public interest\" is in-\nvolved. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967). It is\ntherefore perfectly clear that, were appellant a member\nof the general public, the State's power to afford the\nappellee Board of Education or its members any legal\nright to sue him for writing the letter at issue here would\nbe limited by the requirement that the letter be judged\nby the standard laid down in New York Times.\nThis Court has also indicated, in more general terms,\nthat statements by public officials on matters of public\nconcern must be accorded First Amendment protection\ndespite the fact that the statements are directed at their\nnominal superiors. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64\n(1964); Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375 (1962). In\nGarrison., the New York Times test was specifically\napplied to a case involving a criminal defamation con-\nviction stemming from statements made by a district\nattorney about the judges before whom he regularly\nappeared.\nWhile criminal sanctions and damage awards have a\nsomewhat different impact on the exercise of the right to\nfreedom of speech from dismissal from employment, it is\napparent that the threat of dismissal from public employ-\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 11\nment is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech.\nWe have already noted our disinclination to make an\nacross-the-board equation of dismissal from public em-\nployment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding\ndamages in a libel suit by a public official for similar\ncriticism. However, in a case such as the present one,\nin which the fact of employment is only tangentially and\ninsubstantially involved in the subject matter of the\npublic communication made by a teacher, we conclude\nthat it is necessary to regard the teacher as the member\nof the general public he seeks to be.\nIn sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent\nproof of false statements knowingly or recklessly made\nby him,\" a teacher's exercise of his right to speak on\nissues of public importance may not furnish the basis\nfor his dismissal from public employment. Since no\nsuch showing has been made in this case regarding appel-\nlant's letter, see Appendix, infra, his dismissal for writing.\nit cannot be upheld and the judgment of the Illinois\nSupreme Court must, accordingly, be reversed and the\ncase remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK\njoins, concurs in the judgment of the Court for the rea-\nsons set out in his concurring opinions in Time, Inv. v.\nHill, 385 U. S. 374, 401, Rosenblatt- v. Baer, 383 U. S. 75,\n88, and Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 80, and in\nthe concurring opinions of MR. JUSTICE BLACK in Curtis\nPublishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U. S. 130, 170, and New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 293.\n6 Because we conclude that appellant's statements were not know-\ningly or recklessly false, we have no occasion to pass upon the\nadditional question whether a statement that was knowingly or\nrecklessly false would, if it were neither shown nor could reasonably\nbe presumed to have had any harmful effects, still be protected by\nthe First Amendment. See also n. 5, supra.\n\nAPPENDIX.\nA. Appellant's letter.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n**** Graphic Newspapers, Inc.\nThursday, September 24, 1964, Page 4\nDear Editor:\nI enjoyed reading the back issues of your paper which\nyou loaned to me. Perhaps others would enjoy reading\nthem in order to see just how far the two new high\nschools have deviated from the original promises by the\nBoard of Education. First, let me state that I am refer-\nring to the February thru November, 1961 issues of your\npaper, so that it can be checked.\nOne statement in your paper declared that swimming\npools, athletic fields, and auditoriums had been left out\nof the program. They may have been left out but they\ngot put back in very quickly because Lockport West has\nboth an auditorium and athletic field. In fact, Lockport\nWest has a better athletic field than Lockport Central.\nIt has a track that isn't quite regulation distance even\nthough the board spent a few thousand dollars on it.\n\"Whose fault is that? Oh, I forgot, it wasn't supposed\nto be there in the first place. It must have fallen out\nof the sky. Such responsibility has been touched on in\nother letters but it seems one just can't help noticing it.\nI am not saying the school shouldn't have these facilities,\nbecause I think they should, but promises are promises,\nor are they?\nSince there seems to be a problem getting all the facts\nto the voter on the twice defeated bond issue, many\nletters have been written to this paper and probably\nmore will follow, I feel I must say something about the\nletters and their writers. Many of these letters did not\ngive the whole story. Letters by your Board and Ad-\nministration have stated that teachers' salaries total\n12\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 13\n$1,297,746 for one year. Now that must have been the\ntotal payroll, otherwise the teachers would be getting\n$10,000 a year. I teach at the high school and I know\nthis just isn't the case. However, this shows their \"stop\nat nothing\" attitude. To illustrate further, do you know\nthat the superintendent told the teachers, and I quote,\n\"Any teacher that opposes the referendum should be\nprepared for the consequences.\" I think this gets at the\nreason we have problems passing bond issues. Threats\ntake something away; these are insults to voters in a\nfree society. We should try to sell a program on its\nmerits, if it has any.\nRemember those letters entitled \"District 205 Teachers\nSpeak,\" I think the voters should know that those letters\nhave been written and agreed to by only five or six\nteachers, not 98% of the teachers in the high school. In\nfact, many teachers didn't even know who was writing\nthem. Did you know that those letters had to have the\napproval of the superintendent before they could be put\nin the paper? That's the kind of totalitarianism teach-\ners live in at the high school, and your children go to\nschool in.\nIn last week's paper, the letter written by a few unin-\nformed teachers threatened to close the school cafeteria\nand fire its personnel. This is ridiculous and insults the\nintelligence of the voter because properly managed school\ncafeterias do not cost the school district any money. If\nthe cafeteria is losing money, then the board should not\nbe packing free lunches for athletes on days of athletic\ncontests. Whatever the case, the taxpayer's child should\nonly have to pay about 300, for his lunch instead of 350\nto pay for free lunches for the athletes.\nIn a reply to this letter your Board of Administration\nwill probably state that these lunches are paid for from\nreceipts from the games. But $20,000 in receipts doesn't\npay for the $200,000 a year they have been spending on\nvarsity sports while neglecting the wants of teachers.\n\n510—OPINION\n14 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nYou see we don't need an increase in the transporta-\ntion tax unless the voters want to keep paying $50,000\nor more a year to transport athletes home after practice\nand to away games, etc. Rest of the $200,000 is made\nup in coaches' salaries, athletic directors' salaries,\nbaseball pitching machines, sodded football fields, and\nthousands of dollars for other sports equipment.\nThese things are all right, provided we have enough\nmoney for them. To sod football fields on borrowed\nmoney and then not be able to pay teachers' salaries is\ngetting the cart before the horse.\nIf these things aren't enough for you, look at East\nHigh. No doors on many of the classrooms, a plant room\nwithout any sunlight, no water in a first aid treatment\nroom, are just a few of many things. The taxpayers were\nreally taken to the cleaners. A part of the sidewalk in\nfront of the building has already collapsed. Maybe\nMr. Hess would be interested to know that we need\nblinds on the windows in that building also.\nOnce again, the board must have forgotten they were\ngoing to spend $3,200,000 on the West building and\n$2,300,000 on the East building.\nAs I see it, the bond issue is a fight between the Board\nof Education that is trying to push tax-supported ath-\nletics down our throats with education, and a public that\nhas mixed emotions about both of these items because\nthey feel they are already paying enough taxes, and\nsimply don't know whom to trust with any more tax\nmoney.\nI must sign this letter as a citizen, taxpayer and voter,.\nnot as a teacher, since that freedom has been taken from\nthe teachers by the administration. Do you really know\nwhat goes on behind those stone walls at the high school?\"\nRespectfully,\nMarvin L. Pickering.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 15\nB. Analysis.\nThe foregoing letter contains eight principal state-\nments which the Board found to be false! Our inde-\npendent review of the record 2 convinces us that Justice\nWe shall not bother to enumerate some of the statements which\nthe Board found to be false because their triviality is so readily\napparent that the Board could not rationally have considered them\nas detrimental to the interests of the schools regardless of their\ntruth or falsity.\n2 This Court has regularly held that where constitutional rights\nare in issue an independent examination of the record will be made\nin order that the controlling legal principles may be applied to the-\nactual facts of the case. E. g., Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587\n(1935); Pennehamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331 (1946); New York\nTimes v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 (1964). However, even in\ncases where the upholding or rejection of a constitutional claim\nturns on the resolution of factual questions, we also consistently\ngive great, if not controlling, weight to the findings of the state\ncourts. In the present case the trier of fact was the same body\nthat was also both the victim of appellant's statements and the.\nprosecutor that brought the charges aimed at securing his dismissal_\nThe state courts made no independent review of the record but\nsimply contented themselves with ascertaining, in accordance with\nstatute, whether there was substantial evidence to support the.\nBoard's findings.\nAppellant requests us to reverse the state courts' decisions uphold-\ning his dismissal on the independent ground that the procedure fol-\nlowed above deprived him of due process in that he was not afforded\nan impartial tribunal. However, appellant makes this contention for\nthe first time in this Court, not having raised it at any point in\nthe state proceedings. Because of this, we decline to treat appel-\nlant's claim as an independent ground for our decision in this case.\nOn the other hand, we do not propose to blind ourselves to the\nobvious defects in the fact-finding process occasioned by the Board's\nmultiple functioning vis-a-vis appellant. Compare Tumey v. Ohio,.\n273 U. S. 510 (1927); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133 (1955). Ac--\ncordingly, since the state courts have at no time given de novo\nconsideration to the statements in the letter, we feel free to examine\nthe evidence in this case completely independently and to afford\nlittle weight to the factual determinations made by the Board.\n\n510—OPINION\n16 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nSchaefer was correct in his dissenting opinion in this'\ncase when he concluded that many of appellant's state-\nments which were found by the Board to be false were\nin fact substantially correct. We shall deal with each\nof the statements found to be false in turn. (1) Appel-\nlant asserted in his letter that the two new high schools\nwhen constructed deviated substantially from the orig-,\ninal promises made by the Board during the campaign\non the bond issue about the factilities they would con-\ntain. The Board based its conclusion that this state-\nment was false on its determination that the promises\nreferred to were those made in the campaign to pass the\nsecond bond issue in December of 1961. In the campaign\non the first bond issue the Board stated that the plans\nfor the two schools did not include such items as swim-\nming pools, auditoriums, and athletic fields. The pub-\nlicity put out by the Board on the second bond issue\nmentioned nothing about the addition of an auditorium\nto the plans and also mentioned nothing specific about\nathletic fields, although a general reference to \"state\nrequired physical education facilities\" was included that\nwas similar to a reference made in the material issued\nby the Board during the first campaign.\nIn sum, the Board first stated that certain facilities\nwere not to be included in the new high schools as an\neconomy measure, changed its mind after the defeat of\nthe first bond issue and decided to include some of the'\nfacilities previously omitted, and never specifically or\neven generally indicated to the taxpayers the change.\nAppellant's claim that the original plans, as disclosed\nto the public, deviated from the buildings actually con-\nstructed is thus substantially correct and his characteri-\nzation of the Board's prior statement as a \"promise\" is\nfair as a matter of opinion. The Board's conclusion to\nthe contrary based on its determination that appellant's\nstatement referred only to the literature distributed\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 17\nduring the second bond issue campaign is unreasonable\nin that it ignores the word \"original\" that modifies\n\"promises\" in appellant's letter.\n(2) Appellant stated that the Board incorrectly in-\nformed the public that \"teachers' salaries\" total $1,297,746\nper year. The Board found that statement false. How-\never, the superintendent of schools admitted that the\nonly way the Board's figure could be regarded as accu-\nrate was to change the word \"teachers\" to \"instructional\"\nwhereby the salaries of deans, principals, librarians, coun-\nselors, and four secretaries at each of the district's three\nhigh schools would be included in the total. Appellant's\ncharacterization of the Board's figure as incorrect is\nthus clearly accurate.\n(3) Pickering claimed that the superintendent had\nsaid that any teacher who did not support the 1961 bond\nissue referendum should be prepared for the consequences.\nThe Board found this claim false. However, the state-\nment was corroborated by the testimony of two other\nteachers, although the superintendent denied making the\nremark attributed to him. The Illinois Supreme Court\nappears to have agreed that something along the lines\nstated by appellant was said, since it relied, in upholding\nthe Board's finding that appellant's version of the remark\nwas false, on testimony by one of the two teachers that\nhe interpreted the remark to be a prediction about the\nadverse consequences for the schools should the refer-\nendum not pass rather than a threat against noncoopera-\ntion by teachers. However, the other teacher testified\nthat he didn't know how to interpret the remark. Ac-\ncordingly, while appellant may have misinterpreted the\nmeaning of the remark, he did not misreport it.\n(4) Appellant's letter stated that letters from teachers\nto newspapers had to have the approval of the superin-\ntendent before they could be submitted for publication.\nThe Board relied in finding this statement false on the-\n\n510—OPINION\n510—OPINION\n18 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ntestimony by the superintendent that no approval was\nrequired by him. However, the Handbook for Teachers\nof the district specifically stated at that time that ma-\nterial submitted to local papers should be checked with\nthe building principal and submitted in triplicate to the\npublicity coordinator. In particular, the teachers' let-\nters to which appellant was specifically referring in his\nown letter had in fact been submitted to the superin-\ntendent prior to their publication. Thus this statement\nis substantially correct.\nThe other four statements challenged by the Board,\nare factually incorrect in varying degrees. (5) Appel-\nlant's letter implied that providing athletes in the schools\nwith free lunches meant that other students must pay\n350 instead of 300 for their lunches. This statement is\nerroneous in that while discontinuing free lunches for\nathletes would have permitted some small decrease in\nthe 350 charge for lunch to other students, the decrease\nwould not have brought the price down to 300. (6) Ap-\npellant claimed that the Board had been spending\n$200,000 a year on athletics while neglecting the wants\nof teachers. This claim is incorrect in that the $200,000\nper year figure included over $130,000 of nonrecurring\ncapital expenditures. (7) Appellant also claimed that\nthe Board had been spending $50,000 a year on transpor-\ntation for athletes. This claim is completely false in\nthat the expenditures on travel for athletes per year were\nabout $10,000. (8) Finally, appellant stated that foot-\nball fields had been sodded on borrowed money, while.\nthe Board had been unable to pay teachers' salaries.\nThis statement is substantially correct as to the football\nfields being sodded with borrowed money because the\nmoney spent was the proceeds of part of the bond issue,\nwhich can fairly be characterized as borrowed. It is.\nincorrect insofar as it suggests that the district's teachers\nhad actually not been paid upon occasion, but correct if\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 19\ntaken to mean that the Board had at times some diffi-\nculty in obtaining the funds with which to pay teachers.\nThe manner in which the last four statements are false\nis perfectly consistent with good-faith error, and there\nis no evidence in the record to show that anything other\nthan carelessness or insufficient information was respon-\nsible for their being made.\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 510.-OCTOBER TERM, 1967.\nMarvin L. Pickering, Appellant,\nv. On Appeal From the\nBoard of Education of Township Supreme Court of\nHigh School District 205, Illinois.\nWill County, Illinois.\n[June 3, 1968.]\nMR. JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\nAppellant Marvin L. Pickering, a teacher in Township\nHigh School District 205, Will County, Illinois, was dis-\nmissed from his position by the appellee Board of Edu-\ncation for sending a letter to a local newspaper in con-\nnection with a recently proposed tax increase that was\ncritical of the way in which the Board and the district\nsuperintendent of schools had handled past proposals to\nraise new revenue for the schools. Appellant's dismissal\nresulted from a determination by the Board, after a full\nhearing, that the publication of the letter was \"detri-\nmental to the efficient operation and administration of\nthe schools of the district\" and hence, under the rele-\nvant Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, c. 122,\n§ 10-22.4, that \"interests of the school require[d] [his\ndismissal].\"\nAppellant's claim that his writing of the letter was\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was\nrejected. Appellant then sought review of the Board's\naction in the Circuit Court of Will County, which affirmed\nhis dismissal on the ground that the determination that\nappellant's letter was detrimentral to the interests of the\nschool system was supported by substantial evidence and\nthat the interests of the schools overrode appellant's First\nAmendment rights. On appeal, the Supreme Court of\n\n510—OPINION\n2 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nIllinois, two Justices dissenting, affirmed the judgment\nof the Circuit Court. 36 Ill. 2d 568, 225 N. E. 2d 1\n(1966). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellant's\nclaim that the Illinois statute permitting his dismissal\non the facts of this case was unconstitutional as applied\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments.' 389 U. S.\n925 (1967). For the reasons detailed below we agree\nthat appellant's rights to freedom of speech were violated\nand we reverse.\nI.\nIn February of 1961 the  appellee Board of Education\nasked the voters of the school district to approve a bond\nissue to raise $4,875,000 to erect two new schools. The\nproposal was defeated. Then, in December of 1961, the\nBoard submitted another bond proposal to the voters\nwhich called for the raising of $5,500,000 to build two\nnew schools. This second proposal passed and the\nschools were built with the money raised by the bond\nsales. In May of 1964 a proposed increase in the tax\nrate to be used for educational purposes was submitted\nto the voters by the Board and was defeated. Finally,\non September 19, 1964, a second proposal to increase the\ntax rate was submitted by the Board and was likewise\ndefeated. It was in connection with this last proposal\nof the School Board that appellant wrote the letter to the\neditor (which we reproduce in an Appendix to this opin-\nion) that resulted in his dismissal.\nPrior to the vote on the second tax increase proposal\na variety of articles attributed to the District 205\nTeachers' Organization appeared in the local paper.\n1 Appellant also challenged the statutory standard on which the\nBoard based his dismissal as vague and overbroad. See Keyishian\nv. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967) ; NAACP v. Button,\n371 U. S. 415 (1963) ; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479 (1960).\nBecause of our disposition of this case we do not reach appellant's\nchallenge to the statute on its face.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 3\nThese articles urged passage of the tax increase and stated\nthat failure to pass the increase would result in a decline\nin the quality of education afforded children in the dis-\ntrict's schools. A letter from the superintendent of\nschools making the same point was published in the\npaper two days before the election and submitted to the\nvoters in mimeographed form the following day. It was\nin response to the foregoing material, together with the\nfailure of the tax increase to pass, that appellant sub-\nmitted the letter in question to the editor of the local\npaper.\nThe letter constituted, basically, an attack on the school\nboard's handling of the 1961 bond issue proposals and its\nsubsequent allocation of financial resources between the\nschools' educational and athletic programs. It also\ncharged the superintendent of schools with attempting\nto prevent teachers in the district from opposing or criti-\ncizing the proposed bond issue.\nThe Board dismissed Pickering for writing and pub-\nlishing the letter. Pursuant to Illinois law, the Board\nwas then required to hold a hearing on the dismissal.\nAt the hearing the Board charged that numerous state-\nments in the letter were false and that the publication\nof the statements unjustifiably impugned the \"motives,\nhonesty, integrity, truthfulness, responsibility and com-\npetence\" of both the Board and the school administration.\nThe Board also charged that the false statements dam-\naged the professional reputations of its members and\nof the school administrators, would be disruptive of\nfaculty discipline, and would tend to foment \"contro-\nversy, conflict and dissension\" among teachers, admin-\nistrators, the Board of Education, and the residents of\nthe district. Testimony was introduced from a variety\nof witnesses on the truth or falsity of the particular state-\nments in the letter with which the Board took issue. The\nBoard found the statements to be false as charged. No,\n\n510—OPINION\n4 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nevidence was introduced at any point in the proceedings\nas to the effect of the publication of the letter on the\ncommunity as a whole or on the administration of the\nschool system in particular, and no specific findings along\nthese lines were made.\nThe Illinois courts reviewed the proceedings solely to\ndetermine whether the Board's findings were supported\nby substantial evidence and whether, on the facts as\nfound, the Board could reasonably conclude that appel-\nlant's publication of the letter was \"detrimental to the\nbest interests of the schools.\" Pickering's claim that his\nletter was protected by the First Amendment was re-\njected on the ground that his acceptance of a teaching\nposition in the public schools obliged him to refrain from\nmaking statements about the operation of the schools\n\"which in the absence of such position he would have\nan undoubted right to engage in.\" It is not altogether\nclear whether the Illinois Supreme Court held that the\nFirst Amendment had no applicability to appellant's dis-\nmissal for writing the letter in question or whether it\ndetermined that the particular statements made in the\nletter were not entitled to First Amendment protection.\nIn any event, it clearly rejected Pickering's claim that,\non the facts of this case, he could not constitutionally\nbe dismissed from his teaching position.\nTo the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion\nmay be read to suggest that teachers may constitutionally\nbe compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights\nthey would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on\nmatters of public interest in connection with the opera-\ntion of the public schools in which they work, it proceeds\non a premise that has been unequivocally rejected in\nnumerous prior decisions of this Court. E. g., Wieman\nv. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 (1952); Shelton v. Tucker,\n\n510—OP1NION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 5\n364 U. S. 479 (1960) ; Keyishian v. Board of Regents,.\n385 U. S. 589 (1967). \"[T]he theory that public em-\nployment which may be denied altogether may be sub-\njected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable,\nhas been uniformly rejected.\" Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents, supra, at 605-606. At the same time it cannot\nbe gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer\nin regulating the speech of its employees that differ sig-\nnificantly from those it possesses in connection with reg-\nulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The\nproblem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the\ninterests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon\nmatters of public concern and the interest of the State,\nas an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public\nservices it performs through its employees.\nThe Board contends that \"the teacher by virtue of his\npublic employment has a duty of loyalty to support his\nsuperiors in attaining the generally accepted goals of\neducation and that, if he must speak out publicly, he\nshould do so factually and accurately, commensurate with\nhis education and experience.\" Appellant, on the other\nhand, argues that the test applicable to defamatory state-\nments directed against public officials by persons having\nno occupational relationship with them, namely, that\nstatements to be legally actionable must be made \"with\nknowledge that [they were] . . . false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether [they were] . . . false or not,\" New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 280 (1964),\nshould also be applied to public statements made by\nteachers. Because of the enormous variety of fact situa-\ntions in which critical statements by teachers and other\npublic employees may be thought by their superiors,\nagainst whom the statements are directed, to furnish\ngrounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appro--\n\n510—OPINION\n6 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\npriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general stand-\nard against which all such statements may be judged.\nHowever, in the course of evaluating the conflicting\nclaims of First Amendment protection and the need for\norderly school administration in the context of this case,\nwe shall indicate some of the general lines along which\nan analysis of the controlling interests should run.\nAn examination of the statements in appellant's letter\n2 \nobjected to by the Board  reveals that they, like the\nletter as a whole, consist essentially of criticism of the\nBoard's allocation of school funds between educational\nand athletic programs, and of both the Board's and the\nsuperintendent's methods of informing, or preventing the\ninforming of, the district's taxpayers of the real reasons\nwhy additional tax revenues were being sought for the\nschools. The statements are in no way directed towards\nany person with whom appellant would normally be in\ncontact in the course of his daily work as a teacher.\nThus no question of maintaining either discipline by\nimmediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is pre-\nsented here. Appellant's employment relationships with\nthe Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the\nsuperintendent are not the kind of close working rela-\ntionships for which it can persuasively be claimed that\npersonal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their\nproper functioning. Accordingly, to the extent that the\nBoard's position here can be taken to suggest that even\ncomments on matters of public concern that are substan-\ntially correct, such as statements (1)–(4) of appellant's\nletter, see Appendix, infra, may furnish grounds for\n= We have set out in the Appendix our detailed analysis of the\nspecific statements in appellant's letter which the Board found to.\nbe false, together with our reasons for concluding that several of the\nstatements were, contrary to the findings of the Board, substantially\ncorrect.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 7\ndismissal if they are sufficiently critical in tone, we\nunequivocally reject it.3\nWe next consider the statements in appellant's letter\nwhich we agree to be false. The Board's original charges\nincluded allegations that the publication of the letter\ndamaged the professional reputations of the Board and\nthe superintendent and would foment controversy and\nconflict among the Board, teachers, administrators, and\nthe residents of the district. However, no evidence to\nsupport these allegations was introduced at the hearing.\nSo far as the record reveals, Pickering's letter was greeted\nby everyone but its main target, the Board, with massive\napathy and total disbelief. The Board must, therefore,\nhave decided, perhaps by analogy with the law of libel.\nthat the statements were per se harmful to the operation\nof the schools.\nHowever, the only way in which the Board could\nconclude, absent any evidence of the actual effect of\nthe letter, that the statements contained therein were\nper se detrimental to the interest of the schools was\nto equate the Board members' own interests with that\nof the schools. Certainly an accusation that too much\nmoney is being spent on athletics by the administrators\nof the school system (which is precisely the import of\nthat portion of appellant's letter containing the state-\nments that we have found to be false, see Appendix, infra)\nIt is possible to conceive of some positions in public employment.\nin which the need for confidentiality is so great that even completely\ncorrect public statements might furnish a permissible ground for\ndismissal. Likewise, positions in public employment in which the-\nrelationship between superior and subordinate is of such a personal\nand intimate nature that certain forms of public criticism of the\nsuperior by the subordinate would seriously undermine the effective-\nness of the working relationship between them can also be imagined.\nWe intimate no views as to how we would resolve any specific-\ninstances of such situations, but merely note that significantly dif-\nferent considerations would be involved in such cases.\n\n510—OPINION\n8 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ncannot reasonably be regarded as per se detrimental\nto the district's schools. Such an accusation reflects\nrather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the\nBoard as to the preferable manner of operating the school\nsystem, a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an\nissue of general public interest.\nIn addition, the fact that particular illustrations of\nthe Board's claimed undesirable emphasis on athletic\nprograms are false would not normally have any neces-\nsary impact on the actual operation of the schools, beyond\nits tendency to anger the Board. For example, Picker-\ning's letter was written after the defeat at the polls of the\nsecond proposed tax increase. It could, therefore, have\nhad no effect on the ability of the school district to raise\nnecessary revenue, since there was no showing that there\nwas any proposal to increase taxes pending when the\nletter was written.\nMore importantly, the question whether a school sys-\ntem requires additional funds is a matter of legitimate\npublic concern on which the judgment of the school ad-\nministration, including the School Board, cannot, in a\nsociety that leaves such questions to popular vote, be\ntaken as conclusive. On such a question free and open\ndebate is vital to informed decision-making by the elec-\ntorate. Teachers are, as a class, the members of a com-\nmunity most likely to have informed and definite opin-\nions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the\nschools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that\nthey be able to speak out freely on such questions with-\nout fear of retaliatory dismissal.\nIn addition, the amounts expended on athletics which\nPickering reported erroneously were matters of public\nrecord on which his position as a teacher in the district\ndid not qualify him to speak with any greater authority\nthan any other taxpayer. The Board could easily have\nrebutted appellant's errors by publishing the accurate\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 9\nfigures itself, either via a letter to the same newspaper\nor otherwise. We are thus not presented with a situation\nin which a teacher has carelessly made false statements\nabout matters so closely related to the day-to-day opera-\ntions of the schools that any harmful impact on the'\npublic would be difficult to counter because of the\nteacher's presumed greater access to the real facts. Ac-\ncordingly, we have no occasion to consider at this time,\nwhether under such circumstances a school board could\nreasonably require that a teacher make substantial efforts\nto verify the accuracy of his charges before publishing\nthem.4\nWhat we do have before us is a case in which a teacher'\nhas made erroneous public statements upon issues then\ncurrently the subject of public attention, which are criti-\ncal of his ultimate employer but which are neither shown\nnor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded\nthe teacher's proper performance of his daily duties in\nthe classroom 5 or to have interfered with the regular\noperation of the schools generally. In these circum-\nstances we conclude that the interest of the school ad-\nministration in limiting teachers' opportunities to con-\ntribute to public debate is not significantly greater than\nits interest in limiting a similar contribution by any\nmember of the general public.\n4 There is likewise no occasion furnished by this case for consid-\neration of the extent to which teachers can be required by narrowly\ndrawn grievance procedures to submit complaints about the operation\nof the schools to their superiors for action thereon prior to bringing\nthe complaints before the public.\n5 We also note that this case does not present a situation in which\na teacher's public statements are so without foundation as to call\ninto question his fitness to perform his duties in the classroom. In\nsuch a case, of course, the statements would merely be evidence of\nthe teacher's general competence, or lack thereof, and not an inde-\npendent basis for dismissal.\n\n510—OPINION\n10 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nThe public interest in having free and unhindered\ndebate on matters of public importance—the core value\nof the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment—is\nso great that it has been held that a State cannot au-\nthorize the recovery of damages by a public official for\ndefamatory statements directed at him except when such\nstatements are shown to have been made either with\nknowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for\ntheir truth or falsity. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U. S. 254 (1964); St. Amant v. Thompson, (cid:9) U. S.\n— (1968). Compare Linn v. United Plant Guard\nWorkers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966). The same test has been\napplied to suits for invasion of privacy based on false\nstatements where a \"matter of public interest\" is in-\nvolved. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967). It is\ntherefore perfectly clear that, were appellant a member\nof the general public, the State's power to afford the\nappellee Board of Education or its members any legal\nright to sue him for writing the letter at issue here would\nbe limited by the requirement that the letter be judged\nby the standard laid down in New York Times.\nThis Court has also indicated, in more general terms,\nthat statements by public officials on matters of public\nconcern must be accorded First Amendment protection\ndespite the fact that the statements are directed at their\nnominal superiors. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64\n(1964); Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375 (1962). In\nGarrison., the New York Times test was specifically\napplied to a case involving a criminal defamation con-\nviction stemming from statements made by a district\nattorney about the judges before whom he regularly\nappeared.\nWhile criminal sanctions and damage awards have a\nsomewhat different impact on the exercise of the right to\nfreedom of speech from dismissal from employment, it is\napparent that the threat of dismissal from public employ-\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 11\nment is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech.\nWe have already noted our disinclination to make an\nacross-the-board equation of dismissal from public em-\nployment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding\ndamages in a libel suit by a public official for similar\ncriticism. However, in a case such as the present one,\nin which the fact of employment is only tangentially and\ninsubstantially involved in the subject matter of the\npublic communication made by a teacher, we conclude\nthat it is necessary to regard the teacher as the member\nof the general public he seeks to be.\nIn sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent\nproof of false statements knowingly or recklessly made\nby him,\" a teacher's exercise of his right to speak on\nissues of public importance may not furnish the basis\nfor his dismissal from public employment.

Appellant's letter.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n**** Graphic Newspapers, Inc.\nThursday, September 24, 1964, Page 4\nDear Editor:\nI enjoyed reading the back issues of your paper which\nyou loaned to me. Perhaps others would enjoy reading\nthem in order to see just how far the two new high\nschools have deviated from the original promises by the\nBoard of Education. First, let me state that I am refer-\nring to the February thru November, 1961 issues of your\npaper, so that it can be checked.\nOne statement in your paper declared that swimming\npools, athletic fields, and auditoriums had been left out\nof the program. They may have been left out but they\ngot put back in very quickly because Lockport West has\nboth an auditorium and athletic field. In fact, Lockport\nWest has a better athletic field than Lockport Central.\nIt has a track that isn't quite regulation distance even\nthough the board spent a few thousand dollars on it.\n\"Whose fault is that? Oh, I forgot, it wasn't supposed\nto be there in the first place. It must have fallen out\nof the sky. Such responsibility has been touched on in\nother letters but it seems one just can't help noticing it.\nI am not saying the school shouldn't have these facilities,\nbecause I think they should, but promises are promises,\nor are they?\nSince there seems to be a problem getting all the facts\nto the voter on the twice defeated bond issue, many\nletters have been written to this paper and probably\nmore will follow, I feel I must say something about the\nletters and their writers. Many of these letters did not\ngive the whole story. Letters by your Board and Ad-\nministration have stated that teachers' salaries total\n12\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 13\n$1,297,746 for one year. Now that must have been the\ntotal payroll, otherwise the teachers would be getting\n$10,000 a year. I teach at the high school and I know\nthis just isn't the case. However, this shows their \"stop\nat nothing\" attitude. To illustrate further, do you know\nthat the superintendent told the teachers, and I quote,\n\"Any teacher that opposes the referendum should be\nprepared for the consequences.\" I think this gets at the\nreason we have problems passing bond issues. Threats\ntake something away; these are insults to voters in a\nfree society. We should try to sell a program on its\nmerits, if it has any.\nRemember those letters entitled \"District 205 Teachers\nSpeak,\" I think the voters should know that those letters\nhave been written and agreed to by only five or six\nteachers, not 98% of the teachers in the high school. In\nfact, many teachers didn't even know who was writing\nthem. Did you know that those letters had to have the\napproval of the superintendent before they could be put\nin the paper? That's the kind of totalitarianism teach-\ners live in at the high school, and your children go to\nschool in.\nIn last week's paper, the letter written by a few unin-\nformed teachers threatened to close the school cafeteria\nand fire its personnel. This is ridiculous and insults the\nintelligence of the voter because properly managed school\ncafeterias do not cost the school district any money. If\nthe cafeteria is losing money, then the board should not\nbe packing free lunches for athletes on days of athletic\ncontests. Whatever the case, the taxpayer's child should\nonly have to pay about 300, for his lunch instead of 350\nto pay for free lunches for the athletes.\nIn a reply to this letter your Board of Administration\nwill probably state that these lunches are paid for from\nreceipts from the games. But $20,000 in receipts doesn't\npay for the $200,000 a year they have been spending on\nvarsity sports while neglecting the wants of teachers.\n\n510—OPINION\n14 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nYou see we don't need an increase in the transporta-\ntion tax unless the voters want to keep paying $50,000\nor more a year to transport athletes home after practice\nand to away games, etc. Rest of the $200,000 is made\nup in coaches' salaries, athletic directors' salaries,\nbaseball pitching machines, sodded football fields, and\nthousands of dollars for other sports equipment.\nThese things are all right, provided we have enough\nmoney for them. To sod football fields on borrowed\nmoney and then not be able to pay teachers' salaries is\ngetting the cart before the horse.\nIf these things aren't enough for you, look at East\nHigh. No doors on many of the classrooms, a plant room\nwithout any sunlight, no water in a first aid treatment\nroom, are just a few of many things. The taxpayers were\nreally taken to the cleaners. A part of the sidewalk in\nfront of the building has already collapsed. Maybe\nMr. Hess would be interested to know that we need\nblinds on the windows in that building also.\nOnce again, the board must have forgotten they were\ngoing to spend $3,200,000 on the West building and\n$2,300,000 on the East building.\nAs I see it, the bond issue is a fight between the Board\nof Education that is trying to push tax-supported ath-\nletics down our throats with education, and a public that\nhas mixed emotions about both of these items because\nthey feel they are already paying enough taxes, and\nsimply don't know whom to trust with any more tax\nmoney.\nI must sign this letter as a citizen, taxpayer and voter,.\nnot as a teacher, since that freedom has been taken from\nthe teachers by the administration. Do you really know\nwhat goes on behind those stone walls at the high school?\"\nRespectfully,\nMarvin L. Pickering.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 15\nB. Analysis.\nThe foregoing letter contains eight principal state-\nments which the Board found to be false! Our inde-\npendent review of the record 2 convinces us that Justice\nWe shall not bother to enumerate some of the statements which\nthe Board found to be false because their triviality is so readily\napparent that the Board could not rationally have considered them\nas detrimental to the interests of the schools regardless of their\ntruth or falsity.\n2 This Court has regularly held that where constitutional rights\nare in issue an independent examination of the record will be made\nin order that the controlling legal principles may be applied to the-\nactual facts of the case. E. g., Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587\n(1935); Pennehamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331 (1946); New York\nTimes v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 (1964). However, even in\ncases where the upholding or rejection of a constitutional claim\nturns on the resolution of factual questions, we also consistently\ngive great, if not controlling, weight to the findings of the state\ncourts. In the present case the trier of fact was the same body\nthat was also both the victim of appellant's statements and the.\nprosecutor that brought the charges aimed at securing his dismissal_\nThe state courts made no independent review of the record but\nsimply contented themselves with ascertaining, in accordance with\nstatute, whether there was substantial evidence to support the.\nBoard's findings.\nAppellant requests us to reverse the state courts' decisions uphold-\ning his dismissal on the independent ground that the procedure fol-\nlowed above deprived him of due process in that he was not afforded\nan impartial tribunal. However, appellant makes this contention for\nthe first time in this Court, not having raised it at any point in\nthe state proceedings. Because of this, we decline to treat appel-\nlant's claim as an independent ground for our decision in this case.\nOn the other hand, we do not propose to blind ourselves to the\nobvious defects in the fact-finding process occasioned by the Board's\nmultiple functioning vis-a-vis appellant. Compare Tumey v. Ohio,.\n273 U. S. 510 (1927); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133 (1955). Ac--\ncordingly, since the state courts have at no time given de novo\nconsideration to the statements in the letter, we feel free to examine\nthe evidence in this case completely independently and to afford\nlittle weight to the factual determinations made by the Board.\n\n510—OPINION\n16 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nSchaefer was correct in his dissenting opinion in this'\ncase when he concluded that many of appellant's state-\nments which were found by the Board to be false were\nin fact substantially correct. We shall deal with each\nof the statements found to be false in turn. (1) Appel-\nlant asserted in his letter that the two new high schools\nwhen constructed deviated substantially from the orig-,\ninal promises made by the Board during the campaign\non the bond issue about the factilities they would con-\ntain. The Board based its conclusion that this state-\nment was false on its determination that the promises\nreferred to were those made in the campaign to pass the\nsecond bond issue in December of 1961. In the campaign\non the first bond issue the Board stated that the plans\nfor the two schools did not include such items as swim-\nming pools, auditoriums, and athletic fields. The pub-\nlicity put out by the Board on the second bond issue\nmentioned nothing about the addition of an auditorium\nto the plans and also mentioned nothing specific about\nathletic fields, although a general reference to \"state\nrequired physical education facilities\" was included that\nwas similar to a reference made in the material issued\nby the Board during the first campaign.\nIn sum, the Board first stated that certain facilities\nwere not to be included in the new high schools as an\neconomy measure, changed its mind after the defeat of\nthe first bond issue and decided to include some of the'\nfacilities previously omitted, and never specifically or\neven generally indicated to the taxpayers the change.\nAppellant's claim that the original plans, as disclosed\nto the public, deviated from the buildings actually con-\nstructed is thus substantially correct and his characteri-\nzation of the Board's prior statement as a \"promise\" is\nfair as a matter of opinion. The Board's conclusion to\nthe contrary based on its determination that appellant's\nstatement referred only to the literature distributed\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 17\nduring the second bond issue campaign is unreasonable\nin that it ignores the word \"original\" that modifies\n\"promises\" in appellant's letter.\n(2) Appellant stated that the Board incorrectly in-\nformed the public that \"teachers' salaries\" total $1,297,746\nper year. The Board found that statement false. How-\never, the superintendent of schools admitted that the\nonly way the Board's figure could be regarded as accu-\nrate was to change the word \"teachers\" to \"instructional\"\nwhereby the salaries of deans, principals, librarians, coun-\nselors, and four secretaries at each of the district's three\nhigh schools would be included in the total. Appellant's\ncharacterization of the Board's figure as incorrect is\nthus clearly accurate.\n(3) Pickering claimed that the superintendent had\nsaid that any teacher who did not support the 1961 bond\nissue referendum should be prepared for the consequences.\nThe Board found this claim false. However, the state-\nment was corroborated by the testimony of two other\nteachers, although the superintendent denied making the\nremark attributed to him. The Illinois Supreme Court\nappears to have agreed that something along the lines\nstated by appellant was said, since it relied, in upholding\nthe Board's finding that appellant's version of the remark\nwas false, on testimony by one of the two teachers that\nhe interpreted the remark to be a prediction about the\nadverse consequences for the schools should the refer-\nendum not pass rather than a threat against noncoopera-\ntion by teachers. However, the other teacher testified\nthat he didn't know how to interpret the remark. Ac-\ncordingly, while appellant may have misinterpreted the\nmeaning of the remark, he did not misreport it.\n(4) Appellant's letter stated that letters from teachers\nto newspapers had to have the approval of the superin-\ntendent before they could be submitted for publication.\nThe Board relied in finding this statement false on the-\n\n510—OPINION\n510—OPINION\n18 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ntestimony by the superintendent that no approval was\nrequired by him. However, the Handbook for Teachers\nof the district specifically stated at that time that ma-\nterial submitted to local papers should be checked with\nthe building principal and submitted in triplicate to the\npublicity coordinator. In particular, the teachers' let-\nters to which appellant was specifically referring in his\nown letter had in fact been submitted to the superin-\ntendent prior to their publication. Thus this statement\nis substantially correct.\nThe other four statements challenged by the Board,\nare factually incorrect in varying degrees. (5) Appel-\nlant's letter implied that providing athletes in the schools\nwith free lunches meant that other students must pay\n350 instead of 300 for their lunches. This statement is\nerroneous in that while discontinuing free lunches for\nathletes would have permitted some small decrease in\nthe 350 charge for lunch to other students, the decrease\nwould not have brought the price down to 300. (6) Ap-\npellant claimed that the Board had been spending\n$200,000 a year on athletics while neglecting the wants\nof teachers. This claim is incorrect in that the $200,000\nper year figure included over $130,000 of nonrecurring\ncapital expenditures. (7) Appellant also claimed that\nthe Board had been spending $50,000 a year on transpor-\ntation for athletes. This claim is completely false in\nthat the expenditures on travel for athletes per year were\nabout $10,000. (8) Finally, appellant stated that foot-\nball fields had been sodded on borrowed money, while.\nthe Board had been unable to pay teachers' salaries.\nThis statement is substantially correct as to the football\nfields being sodded with borrowed money because the\nmoney spent was the proceeds of part of the bond issue,\nwhich can fairly be characterized as borrowed. It is.\nincorrect insofar as it suggests that the district's teachers\nhad actually not been paid upon occasion, but correct if\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 19\ntaken to mean that the Board had at times some diffi-\nculty in obtaining the funds with which to pay teachers.\nThe manner in which the last four statements are false\nis perfectly consistent with good-faith error, and there\nis no evidence in the record to show that anything other\nthan carelessness or insufficient information was respon-\nsible for their being made.\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 510.-OCTOBER TERM, 1967.\nMarvin L. Pickering, Appellant,\nv. On Appeal From the\nBoard of Education of Township Supreme Court of\nHigh School District 205, Illinois.\nWill County, Illinois.\n[June 3, 1968.]\nMR. JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\nAppellant Marvin L. Pickering, a teacher in Township\nHigh School District 205, Will County, Illinois, was dis-\nmissed from his position by the appellee Board of Edu-\ncation for sending a letter to a local newspaper in con-\nnection with a recently proposed tax increase that was\ncritical of the way in which the Board and the district\nsuperintendent of schools had handled past proposals to\nraise new revenue for the schools. Appellant's dismissal\nresulted from a determination by the Board, after a full\nhearing, that the publication of the letter was \"detri-\nmental to the efficient operation and administration of\nthe schools of the district\" and hence, under the rele-\nvant Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, c. 122,\n§ 10-22.4, that \"interests of the school require[d] [his\ndismissal].\"\nAppellant's claim that his writing of the letter was\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was\nrejected. Appellant then sought review of the Board's\naction in the Circuit Court of Will County, which affirmed\nhis dismissal on the ground that the determination that\nappellant's letter was detrimentral to the interests of the\nschool system was supported by substantial evidence and\nthat the interests of the schools overrode appellant's First\nAmendment rights. On appeal, the Supreme Court of\n\n510—OPINION\n2 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nIllinois, two Justices dissenting, affirmed the judgment\nof the Circuit Court. 36 Ill. 2d 568, 225 N. E. 2d 1\n(1966). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellant's\nclaim that the Illinois statute permitting his dismissal\non the facts of this case was unconstitutional as applied\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments.' 389 U. S.\n925 (1967). For the reasons detailed below we agree\nthat appellant's rights to freedom of speech were violated\nand we reverse.\nI.\nIn February of 1961 the  appellee Board of Education\nasked the voters of the school district to approve a bond\nissue to raise $4,875,000 to erect two new schools. The\nproposal was defeated. Then, in December of 1961, the\nBoard submitted another bond proposal to the voters\nwhich called for the raising of $5,500,000 to build two\nnew schools. This second proposal passed and the\nschools were built with the money raised by the bond\nsales. In May of 1964 a proposed increase in the tax\nrate to be used for educational purposes was submitted\nto the voters by the Board and was defeated. Finally,\non September 19, 1964, a second proposal to increase the\ntax rate was submitted by the Board and was likewise\ndefeated. It was in connection with this last proposal\nof the School Board that appellant wrote the letter to the\neditor (which we reproduce in an Appendix to this opin-\nion) that resulted in his dismissal.\nPrior to the vote on the second tax increase proposal\na variety of articles attributed to the District 205\nTeachers' Organization appeared in the local paper.\n1 Appellant also challenged the statutory standard on which the\nBoard based his dismissal as vague and overbroad. See Keyishian\nv. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967) ; NAACP v. Button,\n371 U. S. 415 (1963) ; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479 (1960).\nBecause of our disposition of this case we do not reach appellant's\nchallenge to the statute on its face.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 3\nThese articles urged passage of the tax increase and stated\nthat failure to pass the increase would result in a decline\nin the quality of education afforded children in the dis-\ntrict's schools. A letter from the superintendent of\nschools making the same point was published in the\npaper two days before the election and submitted to the\nvoters in mimeographed form the following day. It was\nin response to the foregoing material, together with the\nfailure of the tax increase to pass, that appellant sub-\nmitted the letter in question to the editor of the local\npaper.\nThe letter constituted, basically, an attack on the school\nboard's handling of the 1961 bond issue proposals and its\nsubsequent allocation of financial resources between the\nschools' educational and athletic programs. It also\ncharged the superintendent of schools with attempting\nto prevent teachers in the district from opposing or criti-\ncizing the proposed bond issue.\nThe Board dismissed Pickering for writing and pub-\nlishing the letter. Pursuant to Illinois law, the Board\nwas then required to hold a hearing on the dismissal.\nAt the hearing the Board charged that numerous state-\nments in the letter were false and that the publication\nof the statements unjustifiably impugned the \"motives,\nhonesty, integrity, truthfulness, responsibility and com-\npetence\" of both the Board and the school administration.\nThe Board also charged that the false statements dam-\naged the professional reputations of its members and\nof the school administrators, would be disruptive of\nfaculty discipline, and would tend to foment \"contro-\nversy, conflict and dissension\" among teachers, admin-\nistrators, the Board of Education, and the residents of\nthe district. Testimony was introduced from a variety\nof witnesses on the truth or falsity of the particular state-\nments in the letter with which the Board took issue. The\nBoard found the statements to be false as charged. No,\n\n510—OPINION\n4 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nevidence was introduced at any point in the proceedings\nas to the effect of the publication of the letter on the\ncommunity as a whole or on the administration of the\nschool system in particular, and no specific findings along\nthese lines were made.\nThe Illinois courts reviewed the proceedings solely to\ndetermine whether the Board's findings were supported\nby substantial evidence and whether, on the facts as\nfound, the Board could reasonably conclude that appel-\nlant's publication of the letter was \"detrimental to the\nbest interests of the schools.\" Pickering's claim that his\nletter was protected by the First Amendment was re-\njected on the ground that his acceptance of a teaching\nposition in the public schools obliged him to refrain from\nmaking statements about the operation of the schools\n\"which in the absence of such position he would have\nan undoubted right to engage in.\" It is not altogether\nclear whether the Illinois Supreme Court held that the\nFirst Amendment had no applicability to appellant's dis-\nmissal for writing the letter in question or whether it\ndetermined that the particular statements made in the\nletter were not entitled to First Amendment protection.\nIn any event, it clearly rejected Pickering's claim that,\non the facts of this case, he could not constitutionally\nbe dismissed from his teaching position.\nTo the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion\nmay be read to suggest that teachers may constitutionally\nbe compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights\nthey would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on\nmatters of public interest in connection with the opera-\ntion of the public schools in which they work, it proceeds\non a premise that has been unequivocally rejected in\nnumerous prior decisions of this Court. E. g., Wieman\nv. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 (1952); Shelton v. Tucker,\n\n510—OP1NION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 5\n364 U. S. 479 (1960) ; Keyishian v. Board of Regents,.\n385 U. S. 589 (1967). \"[T]he theory that public em-\nployment which may be denied altogether may be sub-\njected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable,\nhas been uniformly rejected.\" Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents, supra, at 605-606. At the same time it cannot\nbe gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer\nin regulating the speech of its employees that differ sig-\nnificantly from those it possesses in connection with reg-\nulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The\nproblem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the\ninterests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon\nmatters of public concern and the interest of the State,\nas an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public\nservices it performs through its employees.\nThe Board contends that \"the teacher by virtue of his\npublic employment has a duty of loyalty to support his\nsuperiors in attaining the generally accepted goals of\neducation and that, if he must speak out publicly, he\nshould do so factually and accurately, commensurate with\nhis education and experience.\" Appellant, on the other\nhand, argues that the test applicable to defamatory state-\nments directed against public officials by persons having\nno occupational relationship with them, namely, that\nstatements to be legally actionable must be made \"with\nknowledge that [they were] . . . false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether [they were] . . . false or not,\" New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 280 (1964),\nshould also be applied to public statements made by\nteachers. Because of the enormous variety of fact situa-\ntions in which critical statements by teachers and other\npublic employees may be thought by their superiors,\nagainst whom the statements are directed, to furnish\ngrounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appro--\n\n510—OPINION\n6 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\npriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general stand-\nard against which all such statements may be judged.\nHowever, in the course of evaluating the conflicting\nclaims of First Amendment protection and the need for\norderly school administration in the context of this case,\nwe shall indicate some of the general lines along which\nan analysis of the controlling interests should run.\nAn examination of the statements in appellant's letter\n2 \nobjected to by the Board  reveals that they, like the\nletter as a whole, consist essentially of criticism of the\nBoard's allocation of school funds between educational\nand athletic programs, and of both the Board's and the\nsuperintendent's methods of informing, or preventing the\ninforming of, the district's taxpayers of the real reasons\nwhy additional tax revenues were being sought for the\nschools. The statements are in no way directed towards\nany person with whom appellant would normally be in\ncontact in the course of his daily work as a teacher.\nThus no question of maintaining either discipline by\nimmediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is pre-\nsented here. Appellant's employment relationships with\nthe Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the\nsuperintendent are not the kind of close working rela-\ntionships for which it can persuasively be claimed that\npersonal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their\nproper functioning. Accordingly, to the extent that the\nBoard's position here can be taken to suggest that even\ncomments on matters of public concern that are substan-\ntially correct, such as statements (1)–(4) of appellant's\nletter, see Appendix, infra, may furnish grounds for\n= We have set out in the Appendix our detailed analysis of the\nspecific statements in appellant's letter which the Board found to.\nbe false, together with our reasons for concluding that several of the\nstatements were, contrary to the findings of the Board, substantially\ncorrect.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 7\ndismissal if they are sufficiently critical in tone, we\nunequivocally reject it.3\nWe next consider the statements in appellant's letter\nwhich we agree to be false. The Board's original charges\nincluded allegations that the publication of the letter\ndamaged the professional reputations of the Board and\nthe superintendent and would foment controversy and\nconflict among the Board, teachers, administrators, and\nthe residents of the district. However, no evidence to\nsupport these allegations was introduced at the hearing.\nSo far as the record reveals, Pickering's letter was greeted\nby everyone but its main target, the Board, with massive\napathy and total disbelief. The Board must, therefore,\nhave decided, perhaps by analogy with the law of libel.\nthat the statements were per se harmful to the operation\nof the schools.\nHowever, the only way in which the Board could\nconclude, absent any evidence of the actual effect of\nthe letter, that the statements contained therein were\nper se detrimental to the interest of the schools was\nto equate the Board members' own interests with that\nof the schools. Certainly an accusation that too much\nmoney is being spent on athletics by the administrators\nof the school system (which is precisely the import of\nthat portion of appellant's letter containing the state-\nments that we have found to be false, see Appendix, infra)\nIt is possible to conceive of some positions in public employment.\nin which the need for confidentiality is so great that even completely\ncorrect public statements might furnish a permissible ground for\ndismissal. Likewise, positions in public employment in which the-\nrelationship between superior and subordinate is of such a personal\nand intimate nature that certain forms of public criticism of the\nsuperior by the subordinate would seriously undermine the effective-\nness of the working relationship between them can also be imagined.\nWe intimate no views as to how we would resolve any specific-\ninstances of such situations, but merely note that significantly dif-\nferent considerations would be involved in such cases.\n\n510—OPINION\n8 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ncannot reasonably be regarded as per se detrimental\nto the district's schools. Such an accusation reflects\nrather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the\nBoard as to the preferable manner of operating the school\nsystem, a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an\nissue of general public interest.\nIn addition, the fact that particular illustrations of\nthe Board's claimed undesirable emphasis on athletic\nprograms are false would not normally have any neces-\nsary impact on the actual operation of the schools, beyond\nits tendency to anger the Board. For example, Picker-\ning's letter was written after the defeat at the polls of the\nsecond proposed tax increase. It could, therefore, have\nhad no effect on the ability of the school district to raise\nnecessary revenue, since there was no showing that there\nwas any proposal to increase taxes pending when the\nletter was written.\nMore importantly, the question whether a school sys-\ntem requires additional funds is a matter of legitimate\npublic concern on which the judgment of the school ad-\nministration, including the School Board, cannot, in a\nsociety that leaves such questions to popular vote, be\ntaken as conclusive. On such a question free and open\ndebate is vital to informed decision-making by the elec-\ntorate. Teachers are, as a class, the members of a com-\nmunity most likely to have informed and definite opin-\nions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the\nschools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that\nthey be able to speak out freely on such questions with-\nout fear of retaliatory dismissal.\nIn addition, the amounts expended on athletics which\nPickering reported erroneously were matters of public\nrecord on which his position as a teacher in the district\ndid not qualify him to speak with any greater authority\nthan any other taxpayer. The Board could easily have\nrebutted appellant's errors by publishing the accurate\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 9\nfigures itself, either via a letter to the same newspaper\nor otherwise. We are thus not presented with a situation\nin which a teacher has carelessly made false statements\nabout matters so closely related to the day-to-day opera-\ntions of the schools that any harmful impact on the'\npublic would be difficult to counter because of the\nteacher's presumed greater access to the real facts. Ac-\ncordingly, we have no occasion to consider at this time,\nwhether under such circumstances a school board could\nreasonably require that a teacher make substantial efforts\nto verify the accuracy of his charges before publishing\nthem.4\nWhat we do have before us is a case in which a teacher'\nhas made erroneous public statements upon issues then\ncurrently the subject of public attention, which are criti-\ncal of his ultimate employer but which are neither shown\nnor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded\nthe teacher's proper performance of his daily duties in\nthe classroom 5 or to have interfered with the regular\noperation of the schools generally. In these circum-\nstances we conclude that the interest of the school ad-\nministration in limiting teachers' opportunities to con-\ntribute to public debate is not significantly greater than\nits interest in limiting a similar contribution by any\nmember of the general public.\n4 There is likewise no occasion furnished by this case for consid-\neration of the extent to which teachers can be required by narrowly\ndrawn grievance procedures to submit complaints about the operation\nof the schools to their superiors for action thereon prior to bringing\nthe complaints before the public.\n5 We also note that this case does not present a situation in which\na teacher's public statements are so without foundation as to call\ninto question his fitness to perform his duties in the classroom. In\nsuch a case, of course, the statements would merely be evidence of\nthe teacher's general competence, or lack thereof, and not an inde-\npendent basis for dismissal.\n\n510—OPINION\n10 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nThe public interest in having free and unhindered\ndebate on matters of public importance—the core value\nof the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment—is\nso great that it has been held that a State cannot au-\nthorize the recovery of damages by a public official for\ndefamatory statements directed at him except when such\nstatements are shown to have been made either with\nknowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for\ntheir truth or falsity. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U. S. 254 (1964); St. Amant v. Thompson, (cid:9) U. S.\n— (1968). Compare Linn v. United Plant Guard\nWorkers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966). The same test has been\napplied to suits for invasion of privacy based on false\nstatements where a \"matter of public interest\" is in-\nvolved. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967). It is\ntherefore perfectly clear that, were appellant a member\nof the general public, the State's power to afford the\nappellee Board of Education or its members any legal\nright to sue him for writing the letter at issue here would\nbe limited by the requirement that the letter be judged\nby the standard laid down in New York Times.\nThis Court has also indicated, in more general terms,\nthat statements by public officials on matters of public\nconcern must be accorded First Amendment protection\ndespite the fact that the statements are directed at their\nnominal superiors. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64\n(1964); Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375 (1962). In\nGarrison., the New York Times test was specifically\napplied to a case involving a criminal defamation con-\nviction stemming from statements made by a district\nattorney about the judges before whom he regularly\nappeared.\nWhile criminal sanctions and damage awards have a\nsomewhat different impact on the exercise of the right to\nfreedom of speech from dismissal from employment, it is\napparent that the threat of dismissal from public employ-\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 11\nment is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech.\nWe have already noted our disinclination to make an\nacross-the-board equation of dismissal from public em-\nployment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding\ndamages in a libel suit by a public official for similar\ncriticism. However, in a case such as the present one,\nin which the fact of employment is only tangentially and\ninsubstantially involved in the subject matter of the\npublic communication made by a teacher, we conclude\nthat it is necessary to regard the teacher as the member\nof the general public he seeks to be.\nIn sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent\nproof of false statements knowingly or recklessly made\nby him,\" a teacher's exercise of his right to speak on\nissues of public importance may not furnish the basis\nfor his dismissal from public employment. Since no\nsuch showing has been made in this case regarding appel-\nlant's letter, see Appendix, infra, his dismissal for writing.\nit cannot be upheld and the judgment of the Illinois\nSupreme Court must, accordingly, be reversed and the\ncase remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK\njoins, concurs in the judgment of the Court for the rea-\nsons set out in his concurring opinions in Time, Inv. v.\nHill, 385 U. S. 374, 401, Rosenblatt- v. Baer, 383 U. S. 75,\n88, and Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 80, and in\nthe concurring opinions of MR. JUSTICE BLACK in Curtis\nPublishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U. S. 130, 170, and New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 293.\n6 Because we conclude that appellant's statements were not know-\ningly or recklessly false, we have no occasion to pass upon the\nadditional question whether a statement that was knowingly or\nrecklessly false would, if it were neither shown nor could reasonably\nbe presumed to have had any harmful effects, still be protected by\nthe First Amendment.

Appellant's letter.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n**** Graphic Newspapers, Inc.\nThursday, September 24, 1964, Page 4\nDear Editor:\nI enjoyed reading the back issues of your paper which\nyou loaned to me. Perhaps others would enjoy reading\nthem in order to see just how far the two new high\nschools have deviated from the original promises by the\nBoard of Education. First, let me state that I am refer-\nring to the February thru November, 1961 issues of your\npaper, so that it can be checked.\nOne statement in your paper declared that swimming\npools, athletic fields, and auditoriums had been left out\nof the program. They may have been left out but they\ngot put back in very quickly because Lockport West has\nboth an auditorium and athletic field. In fact, Lockport\nWest has a better athletic field than Lockport Central.\nIt has a track that isn't quite regulation distance even\nthough the board spent a few thousand dollars on it.\n\"Whose fault is that? Oh, I forgot, it wasn't supposed\nto be there in the first place. It must have fallen out\nof the sky. Such responsibility has been touched on in\nother letters but it seems one just can't help noticing it.\nI am not saying the school shouldn't have these facilities,\nbecause I think they should, but promises are promises,\nor are they?\nSince there seems to be a problem getting all the facts\nto the voter on the twice defeated bond issue, many\nletters have been written to this paper and probably\nmore will follow, I feel I must say something about the\nletters and their writers. Many of these letters did not\ngive the whole story. Letters by your Board and Ad-\nministration have stated that teachers' salaries total\n12\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 13\n$1,297,746 for one year. Now that must have been the\ntotal payroll, otherwise the teachers would be getting\n$10,000 a year. I teach at the high school and I know\nthis just isn't the case. However, this shows their \"stop\nat nothing\" attitude. To illustrate further, do you know\nthat the superintendent told the teachers, and I quote,\n\"Any teacher that opposes the referendum should be\nprepared for the consequences.\" I think this gets at the\nreason we have problems passing bond issues. Threats\ntake something away; these are insults to voters in a\nfree society. We should try to sell a program on its\nmerits, if it has any.\nRemember those letters entitled \"District 205 Teachers\nSpeak,\" I think the voters should know that those letters\nhave been written and agreed to by only five or six\nteachers, not 98% of the teachers in the high school. In\nfact, many teachers didn't even know who was writing\nthem. Did you know that those letters had to have the\napproval of the superintendent before they could be put\nin the paper? That's the kind of totalitarianism teach-\ners live in at the high school, and your children go to\nschool in.\nIn last week's paper, the letter written by a few unin-\nformed teachers threatened to close the school cafeteria\nand fire its personnel. This is ridiculous and insults the\nintelligence of the voter because properly managed school\ncafeterias do not cost the school district any money. If\nthe cafeteria is losing money, then the board should not\nbe packing free lunches for athletes on days of athletic\ncontests. Whatever the case, the taxpayer's child should\nonly have to pay about 300, for his lunch instead of 350\nto pay for free lunches for the athletes.\nIn a reply to this letter your Board of Administration\nwill probably state that these lunches are paid for from\nreceipts from the games. But $20,000 in receipts doesn't\npay for the $200,000 a year they have been spending on\nvarsity sports while neglecting the wants of teachers.\n\n510—OPINION\n14 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nYou see we don't need an increase in the transporta-\ntion tax unless the voters want to keep paying $50,000\nor more a year to transport athletes home after practice\nand to away games, etc. Rest of the $200,000 is made\nup in coaches' salaries, athletic directors' salaries,\nbaseball pitching machines, sodded football fields, and\nthousands of dollars for other sports equipment.\nThese things are all right, provided we have enough\nmoney for them. To sod football fields on borrowed\nmoney and then not be able to pay teachers' salaries is\ngetting the cart before the horse.\nIf these things aren't enough for you, look at East\nHigh. No doors on many of the classrooms, a plant room\nwithout any sunlight, no water in a first aid treatment\nroom, are just a few of many things. The taxpayers were\nreally taken to the cleaners. A part of the sidewalk in\nfront of the building has already collapsed. Maybe\nMr. Hess would be interested to know that we need\nblinds on the windows in that building also.\nOnce again, the board must have forgotten they were\ngoing to spend $3,200,000 on the West building and\n$2,300,000 on the East building.\nAs I see it, the bond issue is a fight between the Board\nof Education that is trying to push tax-supported ath-\nletics down our throats with education, and a public that\nhas mixed emotions about both of these items because\nthey feel they are already paying enough taxes, and\nsimply don't know whom to trust with any more tax\nmoney.\nI must sign this letter as a citizen, taxpayer and voter,.\nnot as a teacher, since that freedom has been taken from\nthe teachers by the administration. Do you really know\nwhat goes on behind those stone walls at the high school?\"\nRespectfully,\nMarvin L. Pickering.\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 15\nB. Analysis.\nThe foregoing letter contains eight principal state-\nments which the Board found to be false! Our inde-\npendent review of the record 2 convinces us that Justice\nWe shall not bother to enumerate some of the statements which\nthe Board found to be false because their triviality is so readily\napparent that the Board could not rationally have considered them\nas detrimental to the interests of the schools regardless of their\ntruth or falsity.\n2 This Court has regularly held that where constitutional rights\nare in issue an independent examination of the record will be made\nin order that the controlling legal principles may be applied to the-\nactual facts of the case. E. g., Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587\n(1935); Pennehamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331 (1946); New York\nTimes v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 (1964). However, even in\ncases where the upholding or rejection of a constitutional claim\nturns on the resolution of factual questions, we also consistently\ngive great, if not controlling, weight to the findings of the state\ncourts. In the present case the trier of fact was the same body\nthat was also both the victim of appellant's statements and the.\nprosecutor that brought the charges aimed at securing his dismissal_\nThe state courts made no independent review of the record but\nsimply contented themselves with ascertaining, in accordance with\nstatute, whether there was substantial evidence to support the.\nBoard's findings.\nAppellant requests us to reverse the state courts' decisions uphold-\ning his dismissal on the independent ground that the procedure fol-\nlowed above deprived him of due process in that he was not afforded\nan impartial tribunal. However, appellant makes this contention for\nthe first time in this Court, not having raised it at any point in\nthe state proceedings. Because of this, we decline to treat appel-\nlant's claim as an independent ground for our decision in this case.\nOn the other hand, we do not propose to blind ourselves to the\nobvious defects in the fact-finding process occasioned by the Board's\nmultiple functioning vis-a-vis appellant. Compare Tumey v. Ohio,.\n273 U. S. 510 (1927); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133 (1955). Ac--\ncordingly, since the state courts have at no time given de novo\nconsideration to the statements in the letter, we feel free to examine\nthe evidence in this case completely independently and to afford\nlittle weight to the factual determinations made by the Board.\n\n510—OPINION\n16 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\nSchaefer was correct in his dissenting opinion in this'\ncase when he concluded that many of appellant's state-\nments which were found by the Board to be false were\nin fact substantially correct. We shall deal with each\nof the statements found to be false in turn. (1) Appel-\nlant asserted in his letter that the two new high schools\nwhen constructed deviated substantially from the orig-,\ninal promises made by the Board during the campaign\non the bond issue about the factilities they would con-\ntain. The Board based its conclusion that this state-\nment was false on its determination that the promises\nreferred to were those made in the campaign to pass the\nsecond bond issue in December of 1961. In the campaign\non the first bond issue the Board stated that the plans\nfor the two schools did not include such items as swim-\nming pools, auditoriums, and athletic fields. The pub-\nlicity put out by the Board on the second bond issue\nmentioned nothing about the addition of an auditorium\nto the plans and also mentioned nothing specific about\nathletic fields, although a general reference to \"state\nrequired physical education facilities\" was included that\nwas similar to a reference made in the material issued\nby the Board during the first campaign.\nIn sum, the Board first stated that certain facilities\nwere not to be included in the new high schools as an\neconomy measure, changed its mind after the defeat of\nthe first bond issue and decided to include some of the'\nfacilities previously omitted, and never specifically or\neven generally indicated to the taxpayers the change.\nAppellant's claim that the original plans, as disclosed\nto the public, deviated from the buildings actually con-\nstructed is thus substantially correct and his characteri-\nzation of the Board's prior statement as a \"promise\" is\nfair as a matter of opinion. The Board's conclusion to\nthe contrary based on its determination that appellant's\nstatement referred only to the literature distributed\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 17\nduring the second bond issue campaign is unreasonable\nin that it ignores the word \"original\" that modifies\n\"promises\" in appellant's letter.\n(2) Appellant stated that the Board incorrectly in-\nformed the public that \"teachers' salaries\" total $1,297,746\nper year. The Board found that statement false. How-\never, the superintendent of schools admitted that the\nonly way the Board's figure could be regarded as accu-\nrate was to change the word \"teachers\" to \"instructional\"\nwhereby the salaries of deans, principals, librarians, coun-\nselors, and four secretaries at each of the district's three\nhigh schools would be included in the total. Appellant's\ncharacterization of the Board's figure as incorrect is\nthus clearly accurate.\n(3) Pickering claimed that the superintendent had\nsaid that any teacher who did not support the 1961 bond\nissue referendum should be prepared for the consequences.\nThe Board found this claim false. However, the state-\nment was corroborated by the testimony of two other\nteachers, although the superintendent denied making the\nremark attributed to him. The Illinois Supreme Court\nappears to have agreed that something along the lines\nstated by appellant was said, since it relied, in upholding\nthe Board's finding that appellant's version of the remark\nwas false, on testimony by one of the two teachers that\nhe interpreted the remark to be a prediction about the\nadverse consequences for the schools should the refer-\nendum not pass rather than a threat against noncoopera-\ntion by teachers. However, the other teacher testified\nthat he didn't know how to interpret the remark. Ac-\ncordingly, while appellant may have misinterpreted the\nmeaning of the remark, he did not misreport it.\n(4) Appellant's letter stated that letters from teachers\nto newspapers had to have the approval of the superin-\ntendent before they could be submitted for publication.\nThe Board relied in finding this statement false on the-\n\n510—OPINION\n510—OPINION\n18 PICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.\ntestimony by the superintendent that no approval was\nrequired by him. However, the Handbook for Teachers\nof the district specifically stated at that time that ma-\nterial submitted to local papers should be checked with\nthe building principal and submitted in triplicate to the\npublicity coordinator. In particular, the teachers' let-\nters to which appellant was specifically referring in his\nown letter had in fact been submitted to the superin-\ntendent prior to their publication. Thus this statement\nis substantially correct.\nThe other four statements challenged by the Board,\nare factually incorrect in varying degrees. (5) Appel-\nlant's letter implied that providing athletes in the schools\nwith free lunches meant that other students must pay\n350 instead of 300 for their lunches. This statement is\nerroneous in that while discontinuing free lunches for\nathletes would have permitted some small decrease in\nthe 350 charge for lunch to other students, the decrease\nwould not have brought the price down to 300. (6) Ap-\npellant claimed that the Board had been spending\n$200,000 a year on athletics while neglecting the wants\nof teachers. This claim is incorrect in that the $200,000\nper year figure included over $130,000 of nonrecurring\ncapital expenditures. (7) Appellant also claimed that\nthe Board had been spending $50,000 a year on transpor-\ntation for athletes. This claim is completely false in\nthat the expenditures on travel for athletes per year were\nabout $10,000. (8) Finally, appellant stated that foot-\nball fields had been sodded on borrowed money, while.\nthe Board had been unable to pay teachers' salaries.\nThis statement is substantially correct as to the football\nfields being sodded with borrowed money because the\nmoney spent was the proceeds of part of the bond issue,\nwhich can fairly be characterized as borrowed. It is.\nincorrect insofar as it suggests that the district's teachers\nhad actually not been paid upon occasion, but correct if\n\n510—OPINION\nPICKERING v. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 19\ntaken to mean that the Board had at times some diffi-\nculty in obtaining the funds with which to pay teachers.\nThe manner in which the last four statements are false\nis perfectly consistent with good-faith error, and there\nis no evidence in the record to show that anything other\nthan carelessness or insufficient information was respon-\nsible for their being made.",
