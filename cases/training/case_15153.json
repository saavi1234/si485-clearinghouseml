    "summary": "<p>On August 15, 2014, a transgender woman from Pennsylvania filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The plaintiff sued Cabela’s Retail, Inc., under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000(e) et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §12101 et seq. (“ADA”).  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees.  She claimed that she has been harmed by the defendant’s discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that due to her transgender status, she was harassed by her co-workers and subjected to hateful comments, was refused consideration for promotions and was forced to work alone in undesirable shifts.  Although the plaintiff reported these incidents to higher ups in the company, it always fell on deaf ears.  The Human Resources Director at the company would not even allow her to wear a name tag with her chosen female name or to use the women’s bathroom in the store.  The plaintiff was eventually dismissed from her position, despite excellent job performance.  The plaintiff argued that her bad treatment constituted sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII, and disability discrimination, in violation of the ADA.  She further argued that 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b)--which excludes gender identity disorder from coverage by the ADA--is unconstitutional.  </p><p>On October 22, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss but after the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, the court rejected the dismissal motion as moot. </p><p>On November 18, 2014, the defendant filed a new partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Subsequently, on February 10, 2015, the case was reassigned from Judge Jeffrey L. Schmehl to Judge Joseph F. Leeson, Jr.</p><p>Meanwhile, on January 22, 2015 the plaintiff informed the United States that she was challenging the constitutionality of the Gender Identity Disorder (\"GID\") exclusion provision of the ADA.  That provision excludes \"transexualism...[and] gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairment\" from the ADA definition of a disability.  The United States responded with a Statement of Interest; it stated that the District Court should resolve the plaintiff's Title VII claims before addressing the constitutional challenge, because wherever possible, courts should seek to avoid adjudication of constitutional challenges. On February 23, 2015 six prominent LGBTQ advocacy organizations urged the court to invalidate the GID exclusion as unconstitutional or alternatively to find that gender dysphoria is outside the scope of the GID exclusion.</p><p>Judge Leeson was apparently unpersuaded by the U.S.'s constitutional avoidance argument; on September 21, 2015, he ordered the United States to file a supplemental statement of interest actually addressing the constitutionality of the ADA's GID exclusion.  Finally, on November 16, 2015, the United States filed a second Statement of Interest which argued that the District Court should adopt the construction that gender dysphoria, because it has a physical cause, falls outside the scope of the GID exclusion provision, allowing gender dysphoria to be included under the ADA's definition of \"disability\".  This construction again allowed the District Court to avoid addressing the constitutionality of the GID exclusion provision itself. Various LGBT advocacy groups filed an amici statement in support of this construction that found gender dysphoria outside the GID exclusion. Oral argument on the issue was held on December 9, 2015. </p><p>On May 18, 2017, Judge Leeson denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's ADA claims, in an opinion marking the first time the court ruled that transgender people are not categorically barred from seeking relief from discrimination under the ADA. 2017 WL 2178123. Judge Leeson did not rule on the constitutionality of the GID exclusion from ADA coverage, but adopted a narrow interpretation of the term gender identity disorders to \"refer to only the condition of identifying with a different gender, not to encompass (and therefore exclude from ADA protection) a condition like Blatt's gender dysphoria, which goes beyond merely identifying with a different gender and is characterized by clinically significant stress and other impairments that may be disabling.\" </p><p>Judge Leeson found that Blatt's gender dysphoria was therefore not excluded from ADA coverage, and that Blatt had plausibly alleged the elements of an ADA retaliation claim: 1) she suffered from a disabling condition under the ADA, not encompassed in the GID exclusion; 2) she engaged in protected activity by reporting discrimination and requesting accommodations for disability; 3) she was subjected to a \"pattern of antagonism\" as a result of this activity, including Cabela's allegedly intentional and repeated refusal to provide her with a correct name tag.</p><p>The defendant filed an answer to the plaintiff's amended complaint on August 1, 2017. The parties scheduled a mediation with former Judge Annette Rizzo on September 11, 2017. Magistrate Judge Henry S. Perkin dismissed the case on September 18, 2017 because the parties reached an undisclosed settlement. The court retained jurisdiction over the case for 90 days thereafter. The case is now closed.</p>",

[and] gender identity \ndisorders not resulting from physical impairments” from the ADA’s definition of “disability” \n(the “GID Exclusion”).  See Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. \n23); Notice of Constitutional Question (ECF No. 24). \nIt is well-settled that, wherever possible, courts should avoid resolving cases on \nconstitutional grounds.  “If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process \nof constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . \n                                                 \n1 That statute provides:  “The Solicitor General, or any other officer of the Department of \nJustice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend \nto the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court \nof a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 517. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 50   Filed 07/21/15   Page 2 of 4\nunless such adjudication is unavoidable.”  Spector Motor Serv. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105 \n(1944); see also Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. 1 v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 204-06 (2009); Siluk \nv. Merwin, 783 F.3d 421, 434 (3d Cir. 2015).  The United States suggests that, under the \ncircumstances presented in this case, the Court need not address the constitutional challenge to \nthe GID Exclusion.  \nRather, the Court first should resolve Plaintiff’s Title VII claims, as such resolution may \nrender it unnecessary to address the constitutionality of the GID Exclusion.  As presented in the \nFirst Amended Complaint (“FAC”) (ECF No. 9), the facts giving rise to Plaintiff’s Title VII and \nADA claims substantially overlap.  Moreover, the relief Plaintiff seeks under Title VII and the \nADA is identical.  See FAC ¶ 60.2  Thus, the outcome of Plaintiff’s Title VII claims could render \nsuperfluous her ADA claims and, therefore, would obviate the need to resolve the constitutional \nchallenge to the GID Exclusion.  That approach is particularly appropriate given that \ndiscrimination because of gender identity, including transgender status, constitutes sex \ndiscrimination prohibited by Title VII.  See e.g., Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 575 (6th \nCir. 2004); Schroer v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 306-08 (D.D.C. 2008); Memorandum \nfrom the Attorney General, Treatment of Transgender Employment Discrimination Claims \nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 2 (Dec. 15, 2014), \nhttp://www.justice.gov/file/188671/download.  \nAccordingly, the United States respectfully requests that the Court defer ruling upon \nPlaintiff’s constitutional challenge to the GID Exclusion until after the Title VII claims are \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff’s Complaint includes four counts: (I) Title-VII Sex Discrimination, Hostile \nWork Environment; (II) Title VII-Retaliation; (III) ADA-Disability Discrimination, Failure to \nAccommodate; and (IV) ADA-Retaliation.  Each count contains an identical description of \nPlaintiff’s alleged damages.  See FAC ¶¶ 44-45, 50-51, 54-55, 58-59.  Thus, the relief sought by \nPlaintiff equally applies to all claims.  Specifically, Plaintiff seeks: lost wages and benefits; front \npay; punitive damages; compensatory damages; interest; and attorneys’ fees.  See FAC ¶ 60.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 50   Filed 07/21/15   Page 3 of 4\nresolved, as disposition of Plaintiff’s Title VII claims could resolve this case without the need to \nreach the constitutionality of the GID Exclusion.  Should the Court later determine that the \nconstitutional issue cannot be avoided, the United States respectfully reserves the right to \nintervene or file a supplemental statement of interest at that time. \n \n \nDated:  July 21, 2015       Respectfully submitted, \nBENJAMIN C.

No party’s counsel \nauthored this brief in whole or in part, and amici and its counsel have not received any \nremuneration for their participation in this proceeding from either party or other interested \nindividuals. \nGay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (“GLAD”) is a New England-wide legal rights \norganization that seeks equal justice for all persons under the law regardless of their sexual \norientation, gender identity, or HIV/AIDS status.  The Transgender Rights Project of GLAD \nseeks to establish clear legal protections for the transgender community through public impact \nlitigation and law reform.  See, e.g., Rosa v. Park West Bank, 214 F.3d 213 (1st Cir. 2000); Doe \nv. Yunits, No. 001060A, 2000 WL 33162199 (Mass. Super. Oct. 11, 2000); O’Donnabhain v. \nCommissioner, 134 T.C. 34 (T.C. 2010); Doe v. Regional School Unit 26, 86 A.3d 600; In re \nMallon, Transsexual Surgery, DAB No. 2576 (2014). \nMazzoni Center is the only health care provider in the Philadelphia region specifically \ntargeting the unique health care and legal needs of people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender (LGBT).  Founded in 1979, Mazzoni Center has expanded over time to meet the \nneeds of the LGBT community, now offering a full array of primary health care services, mental \nand behavioral health services, and LGBT-focused legal services.  Mazzoni Center’s Legal \nServices Department provides direct legal assistance and representation to LGBT Pennsylvanians \nin a wide range of substantive areas. \nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights (“NCLR”) is a national non-profit law firm with \nheadquarters in San Francisco and an office in Washington, D.C.  NCLR seeks legal protection \nvii \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 8 of 32\nfor lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people through impact litigation, public policy \nadvocacy, public education, direct legal services, and collaboration with other social justice \norganizations and activists.  Each year, NCLR serves more than 500 people in California, and \nmore than 5,000 people in all fifty states.  \nThe National Center for Transgender Equality (“NCTE”) is a national social justice \norganization devoted to ending discrimination and violence against transgender people through \neducation and advocacy on issues of national importance to transgender people.  Founded in \n2003, NCTE advocates for policy reform at the federal level on a wide range of issues affecting \ntransgender people, including employment discrimination; provides technical assistance to \norganizations and institutions at the state and local levels; and works to create greater public \nunderstanding of issues affecting transgender people. \nSince 1973, The National LGBTQ Task Force (“Task Force”) has worked to build power, \ntake action, and create change to achieve freedom and justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgender people and their families.  As a progressive social justice organization, the Task \nForce works toward a society that values and respects the diversity of human expression and \nidentity and achieves equity for all. \nTransgender Law Center (“TLC”) is the nation’s largest organization dedicated to \nadvancing the rights of transgender and gender nonconforming people.  TLC works to change \nlaw, policy, and attitudes so that all people can live safely, authentically, and free from \ndiscrimination regardless of their gender identity or expression.  TLC has served as counsel or \namicus curiae in a number of key transgender discrimination cases, including representing the \ncomplainant Mia Macy in the case that led to groundbreaking EEOC decision Macy v. Holder, \nApp. No. 0120120821 (E.E.O.C. 2012). \nviii \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 9 of 32\nAmici respectfully submit this brief in opposition to Defendant’s Partial Motion to \nDismiss to address the vital importance of allowing individuals to bring claims under the ADA \nwhen they have been discriminated against on the basis of Gender Identity Disorders and Gender \nDysphoria.  Very few courts have addressed, and none have analyzed, the ADA’s exclusion of \nGender Identity Disorders and transsexualism in a case brought by a transgender litigant.  As a \nresult, no court has ever considered the legislative history of the ADA surrounding the exclusion, \nthe application of the exclusion to the new diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria, the fact that neither \nGender Identity Disorders (including transsexualism) nor Gender Dysphoria is a sexual behavior \ndisorder, or the moral animus behind the exclusion.  Analysis of these issues supports the \nargument that the ADA’s exclusion of Gender Identity Disorders and transsexualism is \nunconstitutional or, in the alternative, the exclusion does not apply to the new diagnosis of \nGender Dysphoria. \nAccordingly, Amici urge this Court to deny Defendant Cabela’s Retail, Inc.’s Partial \nMotion to Dismiss and hold that the ADA’s exclusion of Gender Identity Disorders and \ntranssexualism violates equal protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \nor, in the alternative, Gender Dysphoria is outside the scope of the exclusion as a matter of \nstatutory interpretation.  This Court should further hold that Plaintiff Blatt has stated a claim that \nthe Defendant violated the ADA by discriminating against her on the basis of GD, failing to \naccommodate her GD, and retaliating against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation \nand opposing unlawful disability discrimination in the workplace.\nix \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 10 of 32\nINTRODUCTION \nTucked away in the last title of the ADA, entitled “Miscellaneous Provisions,” is a set of \nexclusions from the ADA’s definition of disability.  Specifically, the ADA excludes from its \ndefinition of disability “homosexuality and bisexuality” because they “are not impairments and \nas such are not disabilities.”1  This exclusion is well-supported in medicine and law.  Indeed, it is \nconsistent with the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) removal of the diagnosis of \nhomosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973.2  \nIt is also consistent with courts’ recognition that homosexuality and bisexuality were not \n“impairments” under the ADA’s precursor, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.3 \nThe ADA also excludes from coverage “gender identity disorders not resulting from \nphysical impairments” and “transsexualism” (collectively, “GIDs”),4 but it does so for a very \ndifferent reason.  Unlike homosexuality and bisexuality, the ADA does not exclude GIDs \nbecause they “are not impairments.”  Indeed, from 1980 until 2013, the DSM repeatedly \nclassified GIDs as serious medical conditions.  Although the fifth edition of the DSM, published \nin 2013, changed the underlying diagnosis by replacing GIDs with “Gender Dysphoria” (“GD”), \nthe DSM did not remove the diagnosis.  Simply put, the ADA excludes GIDs not because they \n                                                           \n1 42 U.S.C. § 12211; see also Christine Michelle Duffy, The Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, in GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION \nDISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE ch. 16 (Christine Michelle Duffy ed. \nBloomberg BNA 2014). \n2 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, POSITION STATEMENT ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST \nTRANSGENDER AND GENDER VARIANT INDIVIDUALS 2 (2012), \nhttp://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/MH/Documents/2013_04_AC_06d_APA_ps2012_Transgen_D\nisc.pdf. \n3 See H.R. REP. NO. 101-596, at 88 (1990) (Conf. Rep.) (“The Senate bill restates current policy \nunder section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that the term ‘disability’ does not include \nhomosexuality and bisexuality.”). \n4 42 U.S.C. § 12211.  As discussed below, the DSM considered transsexualism to be a subtype of \nGID until 1994, when it removed the diagnosis of transsexualism altogether. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 11 of 32\nare not impairments, but rather because of the moral opprobrium of two senior senators, \nconveyed in the eleventh hour of a marathon day-long floor debate, who erroneously believed \nthat GIDs were “sexual behavior disorders” undeserving of legal protection.5 \nThe ADA’s exclusion of GIDs is without foundation in either medicine or law.  As \ndiscussed below, the exclusion is inconsistent with the opinion of the national and international \nmedical community, which has always recognized GIDs—and now, GD—as serious medical \nconditions that involve an incongruence between gender identity and assigned sex, not a disorder \nof sexual behavior.  It is also inconsistent with courts’ recognition of GIDs—and now, GD—as \nserious medical conditions entitled to protection under disability antidiscrimination law and other \nlaws. \nTransgender people face severe and pervasive discrimination in nearly every aspect of \ntheir lives.  Indeed, our society has so devalued transgender lives that many transgender \nindividuals contemplate taking their own.6  The ADA should be part of the solution to this \ndiscrimination, not part of the problem.

See Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n. Def.’s Part’l Mot. Dismiss, at pp. 3-7. \nARGUMENT \nI. GIDs AND GD ARE SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. \nTo understand the diagnoses of GIDs and GD, it is first helpful to understand the \nmeaning of “transgender.”  A transgender person is someone whose gender identity—that is, an \nindividual’s internal sense of being male or female—does not align with his or her assigned sex \nat birth.8  Usually, people born with the physical characteristics of males psychologically identify \nas men, and those with the physical characteristics of females psychologically identify as \nwomen.  However, for a transgender person, this is not true; the person’s body and the person’s \ngender identity do not match.9  A growing body of medical research suggests that this \nincongruence is caused by “genetics and/or in utero exposure to the ‘wrong’ hormones during the \n                                                           \n8 See, e.g., AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF \nMENTAL DISORDERS 451 (5th ed. 2013) [hereinafter “DSM-5”]; U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL \nMANAGEMENT, GUIDANCE REGARDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS IN THE \nFEDERAL WORKPLACE [hereinafter “OPM GUIDANCE”], http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-\noversight/diversity-and-inclusion/reference-materials/gender-identity-guidance/; see also app. A. \n9 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 452-53. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 13 of 32\ndevelopment of the brain, such that the anatomic physical body and the brain develop in different \ngender paths.”10 \nFor many transgender people, this incongruence between gender identity and assigned \nsex does not interfere with their lives; they are completely comfortable living just the way they \nare.11  For some transgender people, however, the incongruence results in gender dysphoria—\ni.e., a feeling of stress and discomfort with one’s assigned sex.12  Such gender dysphoria, if \nclinically significant and persistent, is a serious medical condition and has been regarded as such \nfor well over fifty years. \nA. GIDs and GD are widely recognized by the national and international medical \ncommunity as serious medical conditions. \n \nThe concept of gender dysphoria as a serious medical condition first emerged in the \n1950’s.13  At that time, Dr. Harry Benjamin, a New York endocrinologist, began treating people \nstruggling with gender identity issues by providing them with hormonal therapy and referrals for \n                                                           \n10 Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-77 (discussing recent medical studies); see also DSM-5, supra note \n8, at 457 (discussing genetic and, possibly, hormonal contribution to GD); id. at 20 (defining \n“mental disorders” to include dysfunctions of “biological” and “developmental”—as well as \n“psychological”—processes underlying mental functioning). \n11 See Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-10; see also DSM-5, supra note 8, at 453 (stating that, in \naddition to a marked incongruence between gender identity and assigned sex, individuals with \ngender dysphoria exhibit “distress about this incongruence”). \n12 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 451 (“Gender dysphoria as a general descriptive term refers to an \nindividual’s affective/cognitive discontent with the assigned gender but is more specifically \ndefined when used as a diagnostic category.”). \n13 See Jack Drescher et al., Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11, \nINTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY, at 569 (Dec. 2012), available at http://atme-\nev.de/download/psychoszuICD11.pdf; Dallas Denny, Transgender Communities of the United \nStates in the Late Twentieth Century, in TRANSGENDER RIGHTS 175 (2006).  Although \npsychiatric and medical theorizing about gender dysphoria began in the Western world in the \n19th century, and physicians in Europe began performing gender reassignment surgery as early \nas the 1920’s, gender dysphoria and gender reassignment surgery remained little known until \n1952, when the U.S. media sensationally reported ex-G.I. George Jorgensen undergoing gender \nreassignment surgery in Denmark and returning to the U.S. as Christine Jorgensen.  Drescher et \nal., supra note 13, at 569. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 14 of 32\nsurgery.14  In 1966, in his influential treatise, “The Transsexual Phenomenon,” Dr. Benjamin \ndefined “transsexualism” as a “syndrome” that results in one’s being “deeply unhappy as a \nmember of the sex (or gender) to which he or she was assigned by the anatomical structure of the \nbody, particularly the genitals.”15  In 1969, a medical protocol for gender reassignment was \ndeveloped and, in the ensuing decade, over forty university-affiliated gender programs sprang up \nacross the U.S., providing treatment to individuals with gender identity issues.16 \nIn 1980, the American Psychiatric Association introduced the GID diagnosis in the third \nedition of the DSM.  The DSM-III, as it was called, defined GIDs as “an incongruence between \nanatomic sex and gender identity,” and created three GID subtypes:  one for adolescents and \nadults (“Transsexualism”), another for children (“GID of Childhood”), and a third for conditions \nthat did not fit the diagnostic criteria of the first two: “Atypical GID.”17  In 1987, a revised \nversion of the DSM, known as the DSM-III-R (which was the version in effect at the time the \nADA was being debated), retained these three diagnoses18 and added a fourth:  “GID of \nadolescence or adulthood, nontranssexual type.”19  In 1994, the DSM-IV combined the diagnoses \n                                                           \n14 Denny, supra note 13, at 175. \n15 HARRY BENJAMIN, M.D., THE TRANSSEXUAL PHENOMENON 11-12 (1966), available at \nhttp://www.mut23.de/texte/Harry%20Benjamin%20-\n%20The%20Transsexual%20Phenomenon.pdf.  \n16 Denny, supra note 13, at 175-76. \n17 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL \nDISORDERS 261-66 (3rd ed.1980). \n18 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL \nDISORDERS 71-78 (3rd ed., rev. 1987) [hereinafter “DSM-III-R”].

These changes are discussed in greater detail in Section II, below. \nThe international medical community’s recognition of GID has traced a similar path.  The \nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD), published by the World Health Organization \npursuant to a consensus of 194 member states, has classified GID as a mental health condition \nsince 1975.21  The eleventh edition of the ICD, which is expected to be published in 2017, will \nrename “transsexualism”—the ICD’s GID diagnosis for adolescents and adults—“Gender \nIncongruence,” characterized by “a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual’s \nexperienced gender and the assigned sex.”22 \nAccording to the DSM-5, GD is characterized by: (1) a marked incongruence between \none’s gender identity and one’s assigned sex, which is often accompanied by a strong desire to \nbe rid of one’s primary and secondary sex characteristics and/or to acquire primary/secondary \n                                                           \n20 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL \nDISORDERS 532-38 (4th ed.1994) [hereinafter “DSM-IV”].  With its removal in 1994, \ntranssexualism is no longer considered to be a mental health condition under the DSM. \n21 Drescher et al., supra note 13, at 570.  The ICD-9, published in 1975, classified \n“transsexualism” as a mental health condition.  Id.  The most current edition of the ICD, ICD-10, \npublished in 1990, includes the classification “Gender Identity Disorders,” and uses \n“transsexualism” to refer specifically to the GID diagnosis for adults and adolescents.  See \nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES F64 (10th rev. \n2015) [hereinafter “ICD-10”], available at \nhttp://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F60-F69. \n22 World Health Organization, WPATH ICD-11 Consensus Meeting, at 5 (2013), \nhttp://www.wpath.org/uploaded_files/140/files/ICD%20Meeting%20Packet-Report-Final-\nsm.pdf.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 16 of 32\nsex characteristics of the other gender; and (2) intense emotional pain and suffering resulting \nfrom this incongruence.23  Among adolescents and adults, GD often begins in early childhood, \naround the ages of 2-3 (“Early onset gender dysphoria”), but it may also occur around puberty or \neven later in life (“Late-onset gender dysphoria”).24  If left medically untreated, GD can result in \ndebilitating depression, anxiety and, for some people, suicidality and death.25 \nLike other medical conditions, GD can be ameliorated through medical treatment.26  \nThere is no single course of medical treatment that is appropriate for every person with GD.  \nInstead, the World Professional Association For Transgender Health, Inc. (“WPATH”) (formerly \nknown as “The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association, Inc.”), has \nestablished internationally accepted Standards of Care (“SOC”) for the treatment of people with \nGID.27  The SOC were originally approved in 1979 and have undergone seven revisions through \n2012.  As part of the SOC, many transgender individuals with GD undergo a medically-\nrecommended and supervised gender transition in order to live life consistent with their gender \nidentity.28  \n                                                           \n23 See DSM-5, supra note 8, at 452 (“The condition is associated with clinically significant \ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.”); id. at \n453 (stating that, in addition to marked incongruence, “[t]here must also be evidence of distress \nabout this incongruence”). \n24 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 455-56. \n25 Id. at 454-55. \n26 See WORLD PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH, STANDARDS OF CARE 5 \n(7th ed., 2012) [hereinafter “SOC”], available at \nhttp://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7\n%20Full%20Book.pdf (“Gender dysphoria can in large part be alleviated through treatment.”); \nsee also DSM-5, supra note 8, at 451 (stating that “many [individuals] are distressed if the \ndesired physical interventions by means of hormone and/or surgery are not available”) (emphasis \nadded). \n27 See SOC, supra note 26, at 1. \n28 See id. at 9-10; see also OPM GUIDANCE, supra note 8 (discussing gender transition). \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 17 of 32\nThe current SOC recommend an individualized approach to gender transition, consisting \nof a medically-appropriate combination of hormone therapy, “living part time or full time in \nanother gender role, consistent with one’s gender identity,” gender reassignment surgery, and/or \npsychotherapy.29  Living consistent with one’s desired gender role consists of “present[ing] \nconsistently, on a day-to-day basis and across all settings of life, in [one’s] desired gender role,” \nwhich is “based on expert clinical consensus that this experience provides ample opportunity for \npatients to experience and socially adjust in their desired gender role, before undergoing \nirreversible surgery.”30  To complete their medical transition, some transgender individuals may \nonly need to live part time or full time in their desired gender role without undergoing hormone \ntherapy or surgery.31  Others may decide with their health care provider that it is medically \nnecessary for them to undergo hormone therapy and/or gender reassignment surgery as well.32  \nThis was the treatment course followed by Plaintiff Blatt, who, consistent with the SOC, took \nsteps to “alter her physical appearance to conform to her female gender identity, including \ndressing in feminine attire, growing long hair, and engaging in hormone therapy in order to \nchange her physical features.”  Compl. at ¶ 11.

According to the AMA, \nAn established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical \nnecessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms \nof therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID . . . . Health experts in GID, \nincluding  WPATH,  have  rejected  the  myth  that  such  treatments  are  “cosmetic”  or \n“experimental” and have recognized that these treatments can provide safe and effective \ntreatment for a serious health condition.34 \n \nB. GIDs are widely recognized by courts as serious medical conditions. \nFederal courts have consistently recognized GIDs as serious medical conditions under \nfederal disability antidiscrimination law and other laws. \n1. Federal courts’ recognition of GIDs under pre-ADA federal disability \nantidiscrimination law \n \nPrior to the ADA’s passage in 1990, federal disability antidiscrimination law recognized \nGIDs as impairments that may constitute a disability under the ADA’s precursor, the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  For example, in Doe v. United States Postal Service, the plaintiff, a \n                                                           \n33 SOC, supra note 26, at 5 (“Treatment is individualized: What helps one person alleviate \ngender dysphoria might be very different from what helps another person.”). \n34 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, REMOVING FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO CARE FOR \nTRANSGENDER PATIENTS 1 (2008), available at http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf; \naccord.

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied the \nUnited States Postal Service’s motion to dismiss and held that the plaintiff “alleged the necessary \n‘physical or mental impairment’” to state a claim for disability discrimination under the \nRehabilitation Act.36  \nIn 1990, Congress wrote GIDs out of federal disability antidiscrimination law, depriving \nmany transgender individuals of the protections they once enjoyed.37  Congress’ complete \nreversal with respect to GIDs is in stark contrast to its consistent treatment of homosexuality and \nbisexuality, whose exclusion from the ADA “was consistent with the treatment of sexual \norientation under the Rehabilitation Act.”38 \n2. Federal courts’ recognition of GIDs outside of the disability antidiscrimination \ncontext \n \nFederal courts have recognized GIDs as serious medical conditions in a variety of other \ncontexts.  For example, in the prisoner context, all seven of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that have \nbeen presented with the question have found that GID poses a “serious medical need” for \n                                                           \n35 No. CIV.A. 84-3296, 1985 WL 9446, at *2-3 (D.D.C. June 12, 1985). \n36 Id.; see also Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-111 to -120 (discussing cases holding the GID is \ndisability under state disability antidiscrimination law). \n37 After passing the ADA (with its GID exclusion) in 1990, Congress passed an identical \nexclusion to the Rehabilitation Act two years later.  See H.R. REP. NO. 102-973, at 158 (1992) \n(Conf. Rep.). \n38 See H.R. REP. NO. 101-596, at 88 (1990) (Conf. Rep.) (“The Senate bill restates current policy \nunder section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that the term ‘disability’ does not include \nhomosexuality and bisexuality.”).   \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 20 of 32\npurposes of the Eighth Amendment.39  Many federal courts have ruled likewise in the context of \ncivil commitment.40  And the United States Tax Court held that GID “is a serious, \npsychologically debilitating condition” within the meaning of the Tax Code and that the costs of \ngender reassignment surgery are deductible—a decision in which the IRS subsequently \nacquiesced.41 \nII. THE ADA DOES NOT EXCLUDE GD AS A MATTER OF STATUTORY \nINTERPRETATION. \n \nAlthough the ADA excludes GIDs, it is silent as to GD.42  No agency charged with \nenforcing the ADA, nor any court, has addressed whether the ADA’s exclusion of GIDs extends \nto GD as a matter of statutory interpretation.  Bearing in mind that “[r]emedial legislation is \ntraditionally construed broadly, with exceptions construed narrowly,”43 the ADA’s text and \nlegislative history strongly support the ADA’s inclusion of GD, for two reasons. \n                                                           \n39 See, e.g., O’Donnabhain v.

Pa. 2001) (holding that fact question precluded \nsummary judgment as to whether defendants “were deliberately indifferent to treating Wolfe’s \ngender identity disorder,” and acknowledging that courts “have consistently considered \ntranssexualism a ‘serious medical need’ for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.”). \n40 See, e.g., Battista v.

GD is not the same as GIDs. \nAs the ADA’s legislative history makes clear, the ADA’s list of exclusions was drawn \ndirectly from the DSM-III-R, the version of the DSM in effect at the time the ADA was being \ndebated.44  Because the DSM-5’s GD diagnosis bears little resemblance to the GIDs diagnosis \n(including its subtype, transsexualism) in all prior versions of the DSM, GD is outside the scope \nof the GIDs exclusion.   \nUnder the DSM-III-R, GIDs referred to one of four separate diagnoses.  \n“Transsexualism,” the GID diagnosis for adolescents and adults, required:  “(a) [p]ersistent \ndiscomfort and sense of inappropriateness about one’s assigned sex; (b) [p]ersistent \npreoccupation for least two years with getting rid of one’s primary and secondary sex \ncharacteristics and acquiring the secondary sex characteristics of the other sex; [and] (c) [t]he \nperson has reached puberty.”45  In the next two versions of the DSM, the DSM-IV (1994) and \nDSM-IV-TR (2000), the transsexualism and childhood subtypes were combined into a single \ndiagnosis, “GID in children, adolescents, and adults.”46  This diagnosis required that a person \nhave a “strong and persistent cross-gender identification” and a “persistent discomfort with his or \nher sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex” that “causes clinically \n                                                           \n44 H.R.

First and most obviously, the name of the diagnosis is different.  For \nwell over thirty years, incongruence between one’s identity and assigned sex was considered to \nbe a “disorder” of identity, that is, something non-normative with the individual.48  This is no \nlonger the case.  Under the DSM-5, incongruence is not the problem in need of treatment—\ndysphoria is.49  By “focus[ing] on dysphoria as the clinical problem, not identity per se,” the \nchange from GID to GD destigmatizes the diagnosis.50 \nSecond, the diagnostic criteria are different.  GD replaces the previous showing of a \n“strong and persistent cross-gender identification” and a “persistent discomfort” with one’s sex \nor “sense of inappropriateness” in the gender role of that sex, with a “marked incongruence” \nbetween gender identity and assigned sex.51  The criteria also include a “post-transition specifier \nfor people who are living full-time as the desired gender (with or without legal sanction of the \n                                                           \n47 DSM-IV, supra note 20, at 537-38; DSM-IV-TR, supra note 46, at 581. \n48 See AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, GENDER DYSPHORIA (2013), \nhttp://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf (stating that GID \nconnoted “that the patient is ‘disordered.’”). \n49 Id. (“It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder.  The \ncritical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated \nwith the condition.”). \n50 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 451; AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, GENDER DYSPHORIA, \nsupra note 48 (“Part of removing stigma is about choosing the right words.  Replacing ‘disorder’ \nwith ‘dysphoria’ in the diagnostic label is not only more appropriate and consistent with familiar \nclinical sexology terminology, it also removes the connotation that the patient is ‘disordered.’”); \nsee also Kosilek v. Spencer, 740 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir. 2014), reh’g en banc granted, opinion \nwithdrawn on other grounds (Feb. 12, 2014) (“DSM–5 replaces the term gender identity disorder \nwith gender dysphoria to avoid any negative stigma.”). \n51 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 452; id. at 814 (stating that DSM-5 “emphasiz[es] the phenomenon of \n‘gender incongruence’ rather than cross-gender identification per se, as was the case in DSM-IV \ngender identity disorder.”). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 23 of 32\ngender change).”52  According to the DSM-5, this specifier was “modeled on the concept of full \nor partial remission,” which acknowledges that hormone therapy and gender reassignment \nsurgery may largely relieve the distress associated with the diagnosis.53  Significantly, this \nspecifier expands the diagnosis to those who may not formerly have been diagnosed with GID—\ni.e., those without distress “who continue to undergo hormone therapy, related surgery, or \npsychotherapy or counseling to support their gender transition.”54 \nThird, the categorization of the GD diagnosis is different.  In every version of the DSM \nprior to 2013, GIDs were a subclass of some broader classification, such as “Disorders Usually \nFirst Evident in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence,” alongside other subclasses, such as \nDevelopmental Disorders, Eating Disorders, and Tic Disorders.55  For the first time ever, the \nDSM categorizes the diagnosis separately from all other conditions.  Under the DSM-5, GD is \nnow literally in a class all its own.   \nLastly, medical research supporting the GD diagnosis is different.  Unlike the DSM’s \ntreatment of GIDs and transsexualism, the DSM-5 includes a section entitled “Genetics and \nPhysiology,” which explicitly discusses the genetic and, possibly, hormonal contributions to \n                                                           \n52 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, GENDER DYSPHORIA, supra note 48; see also DSM-5, \nsupra note 8, at 453. \n53 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 815; see id. at 451 (“[M]any are distressed if the desired physical \ninterventions by means of hormone and/or surgery are not available.”); see also id. at 453, 814-\n15 (discussing addition of posttransition specifier). \n54 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, GENDER DYSPHORIA, supra note 48. \n55 DSM-III-R, supra note 18, at 3-4.

Simply put, GD has \nphysical roots that neither GIDs nor transsexualism share.  This is significant, because the ADA \ndoes not exclude all GIDs—only those that “do not result from physical impairments.”58  \nBecause the burgeoning medical research underlying GD points to a physical etiology, GD is \nvastly different from GIDs and transsexualism and instead more akin to GIDs resulting from \nphysical impairments, the latter of which have always been covered by the ADA. \nB. GD is not a sexual behavior disorder. \nThe ADA excludes “transsexualism . . . gender identity disorders not resulting from \nphysical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders.”59  The use of the word “other” is \nsignificant.  As discussed in Plaintiff Blatt’s memorandum, see Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n. Def.’s Part’l \nMot. Dismiss, at pp. 25-26, 30-32, the ADA’s legislative history plainly demonstrates that \ncertain legislators intended to exclude GIDs (and the transsexualism subtype) because they \nbelieved these conditions were sexual behavior disorders undeserving of protection.60  These \n                                                           \n56 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 457 (“For individuals with gender dysphoria . . . some genetic \ncontribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familiality of transsexualism among nontwin \nsiblings, increased concordance for transsexualism in monozygotic compared with \ndizygoticsame-sex twins, and some degree of heritability of gender dysphoria.”); id.

Harkin) (“Well, obviously I am not familiar with \nthese disorders.”); see also app. C. \n62 DSM-5, supra note 8, at 685. \n63 Id. at 685-86.  The DSM-5 lists eight Paraphilic Disorders:  “voyeuristic disorder (spying on \nothers in private activities), exhibitionistic disorder (exposing the genitals), frotteuristic disorder \n(touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual), sexual masochism disorder \n(undergoing humiliation, bondage, or suffering), sexual sadism disorder (inflicting humiliation, \nbondage, or suffering), pedophilic disorder (sexual focus on children), fetishistic disorder (using \nnonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts), and transvestic \ndisorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing).”  Transvestic Disorder, formerly known \nas “Transvestic Fetishism” or “Transvestism,” is different from GD; those with Transvestic \nDisorder “do not report an incongruence between their experienced gender and assigned gender \nnor a desire to be the other gender; and they typically do not have a history of childhood cross-\ngender behaviors.”  Id. at 704; see also app. A. \n64 See Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-153 to -158. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 26 of 32\nalways been grouped separately from the Paraphilic Disorders.65  In fact, the DSM-III-R, the \nversion in effect at the time of the ADA’s passage, viewed “GID” as a disorder “usually first \nevident in infancy, childhood, or adolescence,” alongside eating disorders and developmental \ndisorders—a classification hardly suggestive of a sexual behavior disorder.66  Two successive \neditions of the DSM, the DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000), carried this distinction \nforward, viewing GD as a condition that implicates gender, not sexual behavior.67  \nIn sweeping fashion, the DSM-5 sharply disassociates GD from all other conditions, \nincluding Paraphilic Disorders.68  In so doing, the DSM-5 makes abundantly clear that GD, in a \nclass all its own, is not a disorder of sexual behavior.  In fact, by substituting GD for GIDs, the \nDSM-5 makes clear that GD is not a “disorder” at all—it is a dysphoria.  Because GD is clearly \nnot a sexual behavior disorder, Congress plainly did not intend to exclude it from the ADA.69   \nIII. THE ADA SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE GIDs OR GD AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC \nPOLICY. \n \nAs the District of Columbia Court of Appeals recently observed, “the hostility and \ndiscrimination that transgender individuals face in our society today is well-documented.”70  As \ndiscussed in Plaintiff Blatt’s memorandum, transgender people are disproportionately at risk for \ndiscrimination in almost all aspects of life, including employment, housing, education, public \naccommodations, and access to government services.  See Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n. Def.’s Part’l Mot. \n                                                           \n65 See id. The ICD-10, published in 1990, likewise distinguishes “Gender Identity Disorder” \nfrom “Disorders of Sexual Preference,” such as “Fetishism,” “Fetishistic transvestism,” \n“Exhibitionism,” “Voyeurism,” “Paedophilia,” and “Sadomasochism.”  ICD-10, supra note 21. \n66 See Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-153 to -158. \n67 See id. \n68 See id. \n69 Alternatively, this Court should find that GIDs are not—and never have been—sexual \nbehavior disorders, and strike down the GIDs exclusion altogether. \n70 Brocksmith, 99 A.3d at 698. \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 27 of 32\nDismiss, at pp. 19-21.71  Removing the ADA’s GIDs exclusion on constitutional grounds or, in \nthe alternative, interpreting the ADA not to exclude GD, would strengthen legal protections for \ntransgender people for several reasons.  \nA. The ADA’s inclusion of GIDs and GD would eliminate a source of blatant, \nlegally-sanctioned prejudice against transgender people. \n \nAs one scholar has commented, “[f]ederal law has an important expressive function, \nespecially concerning the messages it sends about disadvantaged groups.”72  The fact that \nCongress went out of its way to exclude GIDs, along with a variety of distinctly different \nconditions that the DSM classified as sexual behavior disorders and/or that the law treats as \ncriminal or reckless, sends a strong symbolic message:  transgender people have no civil rights \nworthy of respect.73  By maintaining this exclusion, the ADA perpetuates the very thing it seeks \nto dismantle:  “the prejudiced attitudes or ignorance of others” and the “inferior status” that \npeople with disabilities occupy in our society.74 \nB. The ADA’s inclusion of GIDs and GD would provide comprehensive \nantidiscrimination protection to many transgender people. \n \nThe ADA was enacted to “establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.”75  In order to claim protection under the ADA, a person \nmust show that he or she is disabled—i.e., that he or she (1) actually has, (2) has a record of \n                                                           \n71 See, e.g., GRANT ET AL., supra note 6, at 82. \n72 Michael Waterstone, Returning Veterans and Disability Law, 85 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1081, \n1122 (2010). \n73 Cf. Cain v. Hyatt, 734 F. Supp. 671, 680 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (“The particular associations AIDS \nshares with sexual fault, drug use, social disorder, and with racial minorities, the poor, and other \nhistorically disenfranchised groups accentuates the tendency to visit condemnation upon its \nvictims.”). \n74 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(6); Sch.

L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 28 of 32\nhaving, or (3) is regarded by others as having a “physical or mental impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more major life activities.”76 \nThe first two prongs of the ADA’s definition require the plaintiff to show that he or she \nhas—or had—an impairment that substantially limits major life activities.  Most transgender \npeople are not substantially limited in any major life activity and therefore are not protected \nunder the ADA.  Those who are substantially limited, however, should have the same right as \nothers to protection under the ADA.  For example, some transgender people experience clinically \nsignificant dysphoria that may “substantially limit” their ability to care for themselves within the \nmeaning of the ADA because they require regular, ongoing, and life-long medical treatment, \nsuch as ongoing psychotherapy and counseling sessions, periodic hormone treatment, long-term \nelectrolysis sessions, and outpatient body-contouring procedures.77  Transgender people who \nexperience distress, such as depression and anxiety,78 as a result of the incongruence between \ntheir gender identity and assigned sex may be substantially limited in a variety of other major life \nactivities, including thinking, concentrating, sleeping, and interacting with others.79  Transgender \npeople may also be substantially limited in the major life activity of reproduction, either because \nthey literally cannot reproduce as a result of hormone treatments or genital surgery that renders \nthem infertile or sterile, or they choose not to reproduce because their gender identity is not \nconsistent with their reproductive organs.80 \n                                                           \n76 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). \n77 See Jennifer L. Levi & Bennett H. Klein, Pursuing Protection for Transgender Through \nDisability, in TRANSGENDER RIGHTS 85-86 (2006); see also Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-80 to -81 \n(citing cases). \n78 See DSM-5, supra note 8, at 459. \n79 See Duffy, supra note 1, at 16-81 to -82 (citing cases). \n80 See id. at 16-82 to -83 (citing cases). \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 29 of 32\nThe third prong of the ADA’s definition of disability (the “regarded-as” prong) is \ndifferent from the first two, because it covers those whose impairments are not substantially \nlimiting and even non-existent.  The limitations with which the regarded-as prong is concerned \nderive not from the individual’s impairment, but rather from the “negative reactions” of others.81  \nAs the Supreme Court stated in the seminal case of School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, \nCongress’ inclusion of the “regarded as” prong was an acknowledgment that “society’s \naccumulated myths and fears about disabilities . . . are as handicapping as are the physical \nlimitations that flow from actual impairment.”82  Under the regarded-as prong, many transgender \npeople may be substantially limited not as the inherent result of an impairment, but rather as a \nresult of others’ negative reactions—namely fear, discomfort, lack of understanding, and \nanimus.83 \nIn 2008, the ADA Amendments Act greatly expanded the ADA’s definition of disability \nin two ways, making it easier for transgender people to claim protection under the law.  First, \nunder the first two prongs of the definition, the Amendments added numerous cascading rules of \nconstruction that significantly reduce the threshold showing of substantial limitation of a major \nlife activity, and also expanded the list of “major life activities.”84  Under these new rules of \nconstruction, more transgender people would be found to be substantially limited in a major life \n                                                           \n81 Arline, 480 U.S. at 283. \n82 Id. at 284. \n83 See Levi & Klein, supra note 77, at 89; see, e.g., Cain, 734 F. Supp. at 678 (holding that \nemployee with AIDS was “handicapped” because “societal prejudices deem persons with AIDS \nas having . . . an impairment” that substantially major life activities) (interpreting Pennsylvania \ncivil rights statute that mirrors ADA). \n84 See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2), (4); see generally Kevin M. Barry, Exactly What Congress \nIntended?, 17 EMP. RTS. & EMP. POL’Y J. 5, 24-25 (2013) (discussing ADAAA’s changes to first \nand second prongs of disability definition).  \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 30 of 32\nactivity.85  Second, the Amendments clarify that coverage under the “regarded as” prong turns on \nadverse treatment, not the difficult-to-prove perception of an employer.  The more expansive \n“regarded as” prong protects nearly anyone who is adversely treated based on any impairment—\nwhether the impairment is actual or perceived, and functionally limiting or not.86  Simply put, \nvirtually any person who is treated adversely based on GID or GD, whether real or perceived, \nwould be covered under the ADA’s regarded-as prong, as amended.87 \nBecause the discrimination at issue in this case took place in 2006 and 2007, the \nAmendments to the ADA, which were enacted in 2009, do not apply.  Nevertheless, because the \nAmendments clarify that Congress originally intended the ADA to cover nearly all impairments, \nnot just those typically considered to be “disabilities,” they bolster the conclusion that GIDs and \nGD belong within that broad scope of coverage.88 \n \n \n                                                           \n85 Under the ADA, as amended, a court cannot consider the corrective effects of mitigating \nmeasures, such as hormone therapy, see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(E); it must look at GID or GD as \nthough the condition is currently causing distress, see id. § 12102(4)(D); it must construe the \ndefinition of disability broadly, see id. § 12102(4)(A)-(B); and it must consider the impact of \nGIDs or GD on a newly expanded list of “major life activities” and the operation of “major \nbodily functions.”  42 U.S.C. 12102(2)(A)-(B); cf. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(3)(ii) (21012) (listing \nmental health conditions that “will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a \nsubstantial limitation on a major life activity.”). \n86 See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A); see also ADA Amendments Act of 2008 § 2(b)(2) (stating that \npurpose of Amendments is “to reinstate the reasoning of [Arline], which set forth a broad view of \nthe third prong of the definition of [disability]”); see generally Barry, Exactly What Congress \nIntended, supra note 84, at 21-22 (discussing ADAAA’s changes to “regarded as” prong of \ndisability definition). \n87 See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). \n88 See Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Imp. & Power Dist., 555 F.3d 850, 861-62 (9th Cir. \n2009) (“[T]he ADAAA sheds light on Congress’ original intent when it enacted the ADA. . . . \nWhile we decide this case under the ADA, and not the ADAAA, the original congressional intent \nas expressed in the amendment bolsters our conclusions.”). \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 31 of 32\nC.  The ADA’s inclusion of GIDs and GD would allow transgender workers to \nrequest reasonable accommodations while undergoing gender transition.   \n \nUnlike other civil rights laws, the ADA explicitly defines discrimination to include the \nfailure of an employer to “mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.”89  Reasonable accommodations \ninclude “making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities,” as well as “part-time or modified work schedules,” “appropriate \nadjustment or modifications of . . . policies,”90 and “[p]ermitting the use of accrued paid leave, or \nunpaid leave.”91 \nFor transgender workers, a reasonable accommodation might include modifying policies \ngoverning restroom usage and dressing and grooming standards, as well as modifying a person’s \nwork schedule or granting a person leave to seek counseling, hormone therapy, electrolysis, \nreassignment surgery, or other treatment.  Although an “employer does not have to provide a \nreasonable accommodation that would cause an ‘undue hardship’ to the employer,”92 most \naccommodations for transgender workers are modest and impose no costs.  Indeed, the federal \ngovernment has adopted accommodations for dress codes and gender-segregated facilities as a \nmatter of right for federal employees,93 and numerous states have done likewise.94 \n \n \n                                                           \n89 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). \n90 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(A)-(B). \n91 U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE:  \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND UNDUE HARDSHIP UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT (2002), http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html#leave. \n92 Id. \n93 See OPM GUIDANCE, supra note 8; see also Duffy, supra note 1, at 35-23 to -26, 36-19 to -21. \n94 See Duffy, supra note 1, 35-18 to -22, 36-21 to -27. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 33   Filed 02/23/15   Page 32 of 32\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should deny Defendant Cabela’s Retail, Inc.’s Partial Motion to Dismiss and \nhold that the ADA’s exclusion of GIDs and transsexualism violates equal protection under the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment or, in the alternative, GD is outside the scope of the \nexclusion as a matter of statutory interpretation.  This Court should further hold that Plaintiff \nBlatt has stated a claim that the Defendant violated the ADA by discriminating against her on the \nbasis of GD, failing to accommodate her GD, and retaliating against her for requesting a \nreasonable accommodation and opposing unlawful disability discrimination in the workplace.  \nSuch a result is the correct result under the law.  It would also provide sorely needed, \ncomprehensive antidiscrimination protection to transgender people and eliminate a source of \nblatant, legally-sanctioned prejudice against them. \nRespectfully Submitted, \n             \ns/Kevin Barry \n            Kevin Barry \nPro Hac Vice \nQuinnipiac University School of Law Legal Clinic \n275 Mount Carmel Ave. \nHamden, Connecticut 06518 \n(203) 582-3238 (tel) \nlegalclinic@quinnipiac.edu \n \nDated:  January 23, 2015      On Behalf of Amici Curiae \n \n23 \n ",

At the time of her birth, Plaintiff Blatt's sex was designated male and her \nparents gave her the male name \"James.\" However, PlaintiffBlatt'smale gender \ndesignation assigned to her at birth does not conform to her female gender identity. \n11.  In or about October of2005, Plaintiff Blatt was diagnosed with Gender \nDysphoria, also known as Gender Identity Disorder, a medical condition in which a \nperson's gender identity does not match his or her anatomical sex at birth. \n12.  As a result of her diagnosis, Plaintiff Blatt has taken steps to alter her \nphysical appearance to conform to her female gender identity, including dressing in \nfeminine attire, growing long hair, and engaging inhormone therapy in order to change \nher physical features. Additionally, Plaintiff Blatt has changed her name from \"James\" to \n\"Kate Lynn\" in order to conform to her correct gender. \n13.  Plaintiff Blatt was employed by the Defendant from on or about September \n17, 2006 until on or about March 1, 2007, the date of her unlawful termination. \n14.  During the course of her employment with the Defendant, Plaintiff Blatt \nheld the position of Seasonal Stocker, and at all times maintained an excellent job \nperformance rating in said capacity. \n15.  By way of background, PlaintiffBlatt was excited to begin her employment \nwith the Defendant, as she is an active participant in outdoor sports, and highly \nknowledgeable about the same. Plaintiff Blatt felt that employment with Defendant \nwould perfectly fit her skill set, knowledge, and interests. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 9 of 25\n16.  At the commencement of her employment with Defendant, Plaintiff Blatt \nwas required to attend atwo (2) to three (3) day orientation. During said orientation, \nPlaintiff Blatt dressed in female attire and used the female restroom without issue. \n17.  Immediately subsequent to orientation, Plaintiff Blatt was required to order \na uniform, and requested a female uniform, as other female employees wore female \nuniforms. After failing to receive a response from the Defendant regarding the uniform, \nPlaintiff Blatt ordered and began to wear a female uniform. Additionally, Plaintiff Blatt \nrequested a nametag that displayed her name, \"Kate Lynn.\" \n18.  Shortly thereafter, Sandy Gates (\"Gates\"), Human Resources Director, \ndenied Plaintiff Blatt's nametag request, and forced her to wear a nametag stating that her \nname was \"James,\" allegedly because employees were prohibited from wearing nametags \ndepicting \"fictitious\" names. Gates further informed Plaintiff Blatt that she could obtain a \nnametag reading \"Kate Lynn\" when her name and gender marker were legally changed. \nCuriously, numerous male employees wore nametags depicting nicknames, such as \n\"Rocky,\" \"Bob,\" and \"Jim.\" Further, Gates required all employees of the Defendant to \nrefer to Plaintiff Blatt as \"James\" or face termination. \n19.  Additionally, Gates prohibited Plaintiff Blatt from using the female \nrestroom as she previously had until she provided Gates with documentation that her \ngender marker had been legally changed from male to female. Accordingly, Plaintiff \nBlatt was required to use the male restroom, a situation that was extremely uncomfortable \nfor her, as she identified as female. Plaintiff Blatt reluctantly agreed, although other \nfemale employees were at all times permitted to use the female restroom. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 10 of 25\n20.  In or about early October of2006, Terry (LNU), Third Shift Manager, \nabruptly called Plaintiff Blatt into a meeting and accused her of failing to \"pull her \nweight.\" Terry further advised Plaintiff Blatt to consider leaving her employment with \nDefendant. Curiously, at all relevant times, Plaintiff Blatt's job performance was \nexcellent, and Terry's critiques were completely unjustified and discriminatory. \n21.  Immediately thereafter, numerous employeesbegan subjecting Plaintiff \nBlatt to constant degrading and discriminatory comments on the basis of her sex. By way \nof example, Plaintiff Blatt was commonly referred to as \"he/she,\" \"ladyboy,\" \"fag,\" \n\"sinner,\" and \"freak.\" Egregiously, Plaintiff Blatt was often additionally subjected to \noffensive questions, such as \"Do you have a penis?\" \n22.  In response, Plaintiff Blatt continually reported the discriminatory conduct, \nboth verbally and in writing, to Lou Bowers (\"Bowers\"), Supervisor, who upon \ninformation and belief reported her complaints to the Defendant's upper level \nmanagement, and to Gates. However, Defendant failed to conduct an investigation or \ntake steps to cause said discriminatory conduct to cease. \n23.  Additionally, the Defendant treated Plaintiff Blatt significantly differently \nthan other similarly-situated employees. By way of example, the Defendant required \nPlaintiff Blatt to remain secluded from other employees in one area of the store. Other \nStockers stocked products throughout Defendant's store, while Plaintiff Blatt was \nrequired to stock only in Defendant's \"Gifts Department.\" Further, while other Stockers \nworked in teams, Plaintiff Blatt was consistently required to work by \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 11 of 25\nherself.Theseclusion Plaintiff Blatt experienced humiliated her and made her feel like a \nlesser employee. \n24.  Further, Plaintiff Blatt was required to work on the third shift at all times. It \nis Plaintiff Blatt's belief that said requirement was enacted in order to keep her out of the \nsight of Defendant's customers. \n25.  In or about November of2006 and continuing throughout the course of her \nemployment, Plaintiff Blatt applied for several promotions with Defendant for which she \nwas well qualified. Although Plaintiff Blatt's job performance was exemplary, Defendant \nrefused to consider her for said positions. Significantly, Bowers informed Plaintiff Blatt \nthat Defendant's corporate office had explicitly instructed him not to promote Plaintiff \nBlatt, although he felt that she was well-qualified for the positions. \n26.  After applying for one of the aforesaid promotions, specifically the position \nofMaintenance Technician, Plaintiff Blatt overheard the current Maintenance Manager \nstate to Bowers, \"Can you believe this cross-dressing gay fruit wants a job in my \ndepartment? The confused sicko can't figure out that he is gay and admit it. I won't \ninterview him under any circumstances.\" Although Plaintiff Blatt reported said \ndiscriminatory comment to Gates, Defendant failed to take corrective action. \n27.  On or about January 29, 2007, an Order was entered in the Schuylkill \nCounty Court of Common Pleas to both legally change Plaintiff Blatt's name from \n\"James Benjamin Blatt\" to \"Kate Lynn Blatt,\" and change her gender designation from \nmale to female. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 12 of 25\n28.  Immediately thereafter, Plaintiff Blatt provided Gates with a copy of \ndocumentation of the legal change of both her name and gender designation, and \nrequested the use of the female restroom as reasonable accommodation, as well as a new \nnametag depicting her legal name. In response, Gates informed Plaintiff Blatt that she \nwould need to send the infonnation to Defendant's corporate office and receive a \nresponse before Plaintiff Blatt could start being treated as a woman. Said response came \nas an unwelcome surprise to Plaintiff Blatt, as Gates had previously assured her that she \nwould be able to change her nametag and use the female restroom as soon as her gender \ndesignation was legally changed. \n29.  Shortly thereafter, Gates blatantly denied Plaintiff Blatt's request to use the \nfemale restroom as reasonable accommodation, egregiously noting that because Plaintiff \nBlatt had not taken any time off from work, she could not have undergone sex \nreassignment surgery. Accordingly, Gates expressed her completely unfounded concern \nthat because Plaintiff Blatt was not anatomically female, she could potentially rape or \nsexually assault a person in the female restroom. Plaintiff Blatt was extremely offended \nand humiliated by Gates' scomments and beliefs. \n30.  Initially, Bowers informed Plaintiff Blatt that the prevailing idea presented \nduring a staff meeting was to require Plaintiff Blatt to utilize the restroom at a Dunkin \nDonuts establishment across the street from Respondent's store. Plaintiff Blatt adamantly \nrefused, as said requirement would force her to leave Defendant's store every time she \nneeded to use the restroom, and would subject her to humiliation based on the \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 13 of 25\nDefendant's belief that she did not belong in the female restroom. Further, no other \nfemale employees were required to utilize the Dunkin Donuts restroom. \n31.  As an alternative \"solution,\" Gates reluctantly permitted Plaintiff Blatt to \nuse the unisex \"family\" restroom in the front of Defendant's store. However, said \nrestroom was located approximately 400 to 500 feet away from Plaintiff Blatt's work \narea, which was significantly further than the employeerestrooms, and was much less \ncleanly than the employee restrooms. Further, walking to the family restroom caused \nPlaintiff Blatt severe embarrassment and feelings of ostracization. \n32.  Although Defendant did eventually issue Plaintiff Blatt a \"Kate Lynn\" \nnametag, Plaintiff Blatt was forced to repeatedly complain to Gates in an effort to attain \nsaid nametag. Defendant issued Plaintiff Blatt three (3) nametags with an incorrect name \nbefore providing her with a nametag reading \"Kate Lynn,\" which is her legal name, in an \nattempt to embarrass and degrade her. \n33.  On or about February 26, 2007, Plaintiff Blatt was involved in an \naltercation with Mercedes Ramirez (\"Ramirez\"), Maintenance Technician. During said \naltercation, Plaintiff Blatt amicably approached Ramirez and asked her a question \nregarding her cleaning schedule. Ramirezresponded by berating Plaintiff Blatt for causing \na change in the restroom cleaningschedule, and verbally attacked her by yelling various \noffensive remarks and obscenities, including, but not limited to, \"You're not a real \nwoman and you never will be!\" Plaintiff Blatt was extremely upset and humiliated as a \nresult of said altercation. In response, Plaintiff Blatt immediately reported the incident to \nBowers. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 14 of 25\n34.  On or about March 1, 2007, the Defendant abruptly terminated Plaintiff \nBlatt's employment with the Respondent, allegedly for threatening Ramirez's son during \nthe aforementioned altercation. However, Plaintiff Blatt never made any threats toward \nRamirez or her son, and in fact, was unaware that Ramirez even had a son. \n35.  Interestingly, Ramirez was neither terminated nor disciplined for her \ninvolvement in said altercation. \n36.  Plaintiff Blatt believes that Defendant's articulated reason for her \ntermination waspretextual and that her employment was actually terminated based on her \nsex, her actual and/or perceived disability and/or record of impairment, and in retaliation \nfor opposing unlawful discrimination in the workplace and requesting a reasonable \naccommodation for her disability. \nCOUNT I \n(Title VII- Sex Discrimination, Hostile Work Environment) \nPlaintiff Blatt v. Defendant \n37.  Plaintiff Blatt incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 36 as though \nfully set forth at length herein. \n38.  The Defendant subjected Plaintiff Blatt to a hostile working environment \nand sex discrimination based on her gender and gender nonconformity, as detailed above. \n39.  The  hostile  work  environment  was  severe  and  pervasive  based  on  the \nnature of the harassment, including egregious statements made by numerous employees \nexpressing  animus  towards  Plaintiff Blatt's  gender  and  gender  nonconformity,  the \nconstant and  unwavering harassment and derogatory comments towards Plaintiff Blatt \nbased  on  her  gender  and  gender  nonconformity,  and  Defendant's  blatant  denial  of \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 1   Filed 08/15/14   Page 15 of 25\nPlaintiff Blatt's right to use the female restroom, as a female employee, because of her \ngender and gender nonconformity. \n40.  Plaintiff Blatt considered the aforementioned conduct to be discriminatory, \nand  reported  said  discriminatory  conduct,  both verbally  and  in  writing,  to  numerous \nmanagement  level  employees  of Defendant,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Gates  and \nBowers. \n41.  Accordingly, Defendant was fully aware of the hostile work environment. \nHowever,  despite  Plaintiff Blatt's  numerous  complaints  of discrimination,  Defendant \nfailed to conduct an investigation or otherwise cause the discriminatory conduct to cease. \n42.  Rather  than  cause  the  discriminatory  conduct  to  cease,  Defendant \nterminated  Plaintiff  Blatt's  employment,  allegedly  due  to  an  altercation  with  an \nemployee.  However, Defendant's reason for Plaintiff Blatt's termination is pretextual, \nand  her  employment  was  actually  terminated  because  of  her  gender  and  gender \nnonconformity. \n43.  Accordingly, Defendant's discriminatory acts have deprived Plaintiff Blatt \nof equal employment opportunities because of her sex in violation of Title VII. \n44.

Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir. 2005) \n(citing Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991)). This Court \nmust “accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff \nmay be entitled to relief.” See Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 374 n.7 (3d Cir. 2002)) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), the Supreme Court recognized \nthat “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more \nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will \nnot do.” 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). In Ashcroft v. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 82   Filed 05/18/17   Page 2 of 6\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), the Court subsequently laid out a two-part approach to reviewing a \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). \nFirst, the Court observed, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations \ncontained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.” Id. at 678. Thus, “[t]hreadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not \nsuffice” to survive the motion; “instead, ‘a complaint must allege facts suggestive of [the \nproscribed] conduct.’” Id.; Phillips, 515 F.3d at 233 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8). \nWhile Rule 8, which requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief,” was “a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, \ncode-pleading regime of a prior era, . . . it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff \narmed with nothing more than conclusions.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79 (“Rule 8 . . . demands \nmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” (citing Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 555)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). For “without some factual allegation in the \ncomplaint, a claimant cannot satisfy the requirement that he or she provide not only ‘fair notice’ \nbut also the ‘grounds’ on which the claim rests.” Phillips, 515 F.3d at 232 (citing Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555 n.3). \nSecond, the Court emphasized, “only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief \nsurvives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief \n. . . [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Only if “the ‘[f]actual allegations . . . raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level’” has the plaintiff stated a plausible claim. Phillips, 515 F.3d at \n234 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). If “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to \ninfer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not \n‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2)). “Detailed factual allegations” are not required, id. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n555), but a claim must be “nudged . . . across the line from conceivable to plausible,” id. at 680 \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). \n“The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’” but there must be \n“more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. at 678 (quoting \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556). “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a \ndefendant’s liability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of “entitlement \nto relief.”’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557)). \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, in October 2005, Blatt was diagnosed with \n“Gender Dysphoria, also known as Gender Identity Disorder,” which substantially limits one or \nmore of Blatt’s major life activities, including, but not limited to, interacting with others, \nreproducing, and social and occupational functioning. Am. Compl. ¶ 10, ECF No. 13. Blatt \nalleges that shortly after she was hired by Cabela’s in September 2006, Cabela’s began to \ndiscriminate against her on the basis of her sex and her disability, in violation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act and the ADA, and that Cabela’s retaliated against her for opposing this \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 82   Filed 05/18/17   Page 3 of 6\ndiscrimination, also in violation of these statutes. Id. ¶¶ 11-32. Blatt further alleges that in \nFebruary 2007, Cabela’s terminated her employment based on her sex and disability. Id. ¶¶ 33-\n34. \nThe stated purpose of the ADA is to “provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101(b)(1). In pursuit of this purpose, Congress opted to define the scope of the statute’s \ncoverage by means of a flexible and broad definition of “disability,” namely, “a physical or \nmental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual.” \nId. § 12102(1)(A). Standing in contrast to this broad definition of disability, there are a few \nexceptions to the ADA’s coverage. The provision at issue in this case, 42 U.S.C. § 12211, \nexcludes from ADA coverage approximately one dozen conditions, including gender identity \ndisorders. \nCabela’s contends that § 12211’s reference to gender identity disorders applies to Blatt’s \ncondition and that the provision therefore excludes her condition from the ADA’s scope. Blatt \nresponds that, if that is the case, then § 12211’s exclusion of gender identity disorders violates \nher equal protection rights.   \nThe constitutional-avoidance canon prescribes that “[w]hen the validity of an act of the \nCongress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a \ncardinal principle that [the court] will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly \npossible by which the question may be avoided.” United States v. Witkovich, 353 U.S. 194, 201 \n(1957) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932)). Thus, if there is a “fairly possible” \ninterpretation of § 12211 that permits the Court to avoid the constitutional question Blatt has \nraised, the Court must adopt that interpretation. As explained below, there is indeed such an \ninterpretation, namely, one in which the term gender identity disorders is read narrowly to refer \nto only the condition of identifying with a different gender, not to encompass (and therefore \nexclude from ADA protection) a condition like Blatt’s gender dysphoria, which goes beyond \nmerely identifying with a different gender and is characterized by clinically significant stress and \nother impairments that may be disabling.1  \nBeginning with the text of the provision, the exceptions listed in § 12211 can be read as \nfalling into two distinct categories: first, non-disabling conditions that concern sexual orientation \nor identity, and second, disabling conditions that are associated with harmful or illegal conduct.2 \n                                                           \n1   By contrast, Cabela’s suggested interpretation aligns with the term’s definition in the revised third edition \nof the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the current \nedition at the time of the drafting of the ADA), where the term gender identity disorders is defined as broadly \nencompassing any disorder essentially marked by “an incongruence between assigned sex . . . and gender identity.” \nSee Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 71 (3d ed. revised 1987).  \n2   The first category includes homosexuality and bisexuality, see 42 U.S.C. § 12211(a), whereas the second \ncategory includes pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, compulsive gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, and \n“psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs,” see 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b).  \n  The legislative history shows that Congress discussed the § 12211 exclusions in terms of these two distinct \ncategories. First, there was a concern among some members of Congress that the bill would include “sexual \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 82   Filed 05/18/17   Page 4 of 6\nIf the term gender identity disorders were understood, as Cabela’s suggests, to encompass \ndisabling conditions such as Blatt’s gender dysphoria, then the term would occupy an anomalous \nplace in the statute, as it would exclude from the ADA conditions that are actually disabling but \nthat are not associated with harmful or illegal conduct. But under the alternative, narrower \ninterpretation of the term, this anomaly would be resolved, as the term gender identity disorders \nwould belong to the first category described above.  \nThis narrower interpretation also comports with the mandate of the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit that the ADA, as “a remedial statute, designed to eliminate discrimination \nagainst the disabled in all facets of society, . . . must be broadly construed to effectuate its \npurposes.” See Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199, 208-09 (3d Cir. \n2008) (quoting Kinney v. Yerusalim, 812 F. Supp. 547, 551 (E.D. Pa. 1993)). Thus, any \nexceptions to the statute, such as those listed in § 12211, should be read narrowly in order to \npermit the statute to achieve a broad reach. See Bonkowski v. Oberg Indus., 787 F.3d 190, 195 \n(3d Cir. 2015) (“Following traditional canons of statutory interpretation, remedial statutes should \nbe construed broadly to extend coverage and their exclusions or exceptions should be construed \nnarrowly.” (quoting Cobb v. Contract Transp., Inc., 452 F.3d 543, 559 (6th Cir. 2006))). This \ninterpretation is also consistent with the legislative history of § 12211, which reveals that \nCongress was careful to distinguish between excluding certain sexual identities from the ADA’s \ndefinition of disability, on one hand, and not excluding disabling conditions that persons of those \nidentities might have, on the other hand.3 \nIn view of these considerations, it is fairly possible to interpret the term gender identity \ndisorders narrowly to refer to simply the condition of identifying with a different gender, not to \nexclude from ADA coverage disabling conditions that persons who identify with a different \ngender may have —such as Blatt’s gender dysphoria, which substantially limits her major life \nactivities of interacting with others, reproducing, and social and occupational functioning. \nBecause this interpretation allows the Court to avoid the constitutional questions raised in this \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npreference as a disability or a protected class of individuals.” See The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989: \nHearing on H.R. 2273 Before the Subcomms. on Emp’t Opportunities & Select Educ. of the H. Comm. on Educ. & \nLabor 101 Cong. 14 (1989) (statement of Rep. Bartlett, Member, H. Comm. on Education and Labor). Second, there \nwas a separate concern that the ADA “could protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of a variety of \nsocially unacceptable, often illegal, behavior if such behavior is considered to be the result of a mental illness,” \nincluding such conditions as “compulsive gambling, pedophilia, and kleptomania.” 135 Cong. Rec. S10765-01, \nS10796 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Rudman), 1989 WL 183216. \n3   For example, during the Senate debate, in response to inquiries about the proposed bill’s coverage of \nhomosexuality, HIV, and AIDS, Senator Thomas Harkin, a sponsor of the bill, clarified that although homosexuality \nitself would not meet the definition of a disability under the ADA, that would not prevent a person who is gay from \nreceiving coverage under the statute if the person had a disability. See 135 Cong. Rec. S10765-01, S10767 (daily ed. \nSept. 7, 1989), 1989 WL 183216. Similarly, the House Judiciary Committee commented that “[i]ndividuals who are \nhomosexual or bisexual and are discriminated against because they have a disability, such as infection with the \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus, are protected under the ADA,” and the Committee “specifically rejected \namendments to exclude homosexuals with certain disabilities from coverage.” H.R. Rep. 101-485, at 76 (1990), \nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 499. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 82   Filed 05/18/17   Page 5 of 6\ncase, it is the Court’s duty to adopt it. Accordingly, Blatt’s condition is not excluded by § 12211 \nof the ADA, and Cabela’s motion to dismiss Blatt’s ADA claims on this basis is denied.  \nCabela’s acknowledges that its motion to dismiss Blatt’s disability discrimination claims \nrests on the Court’s interpretation of § 12211. With respect to Blatt’s ADA retaliation claim, \nhowever, Cabela’s contends that even if Blatt has alleged a disability covered by the ADA, she \nhas nevertheless failed to allege that she engaged in protected activity by opposing disability \ndiscrimination in her workplace. Specifically, Cabela’s contends that “the Amended Complaint \ncontains allegations that [Blatt] reported conduct that she alleges was discriminatory based on \nher sex, not any disability.”  Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. 10, ECF No. 13-1. Further, Cabela’s \ncontends that Blatt has failed to allege that she engaged in protected activity by asking for an \naccommodation for a disability or that Cabela’s took an adverse employment action against her \nbecause of her alleged request for an accommodation.  \n  Blatt responds that her Amended Complaint fairly alleges that she continually reported to \nher superior that she was subject to degrading and discriminatory comments on the basis of her \ndisability, that she requested a female nametag and uniform and use of the female restroom as \naccommodations for her disability, and that as a result of requesting these accommodations she \nwas subjected to a “pattern of antagonism” prior to her termination. Cabela’s replies that Blatt’s \nallegations that she was temporarily forced to wear an inaccurate name tag and was not allowed \nto use the female restroom do not amount to a “pattern of antagonism.” \n  To state an ADA retaliation claim, Blatt must allege that: (1) she engaged in a protected \nactivity; (2) she experienced an adverse employment action following the protected activity; and \n(3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See \nKrouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997). Ordinarily, a causal connection \nmay be shown by “(1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity \nand the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to \nestablish a causal link.” Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. \n2007). A “pattern of antagonism” is a “consistent and continuous” pattern of conduct, which can \ninclude a “‘constant barrage of written and verbal warnings’” as well as “‘disciplinary action.’” \nSee Bartos v. MHM Corr. Servs., Inc., 454 F. App’x 74, 79 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Robinson v. \nSe. Pa. Transp. Auth., 982 F.2d 892, 895 (3d Cir. 1993)).  \nHere, Blatt has plausibly alleged that she engaged in protected activity by reporting \ndiscrimination and requesting accommodations for her disability. She has also plausibly alleged \nthat she was subjected to a “pattern of antagonism” as a result of this activity, including Cabela’s \nallegedly intentional and repeated refusal to provide her with a correct name tag.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 82   Filed 05/18/17   Page 6 of 6\nThe Court, accepting the allegations of the Amended Complaint as true, as it is required \nto do at this stage of the case, denies Cabela’s request to dismiss Count III and Count IV of the \nAmended Complaint for the reasons set forth above. The case will be permitted to proceed to \ndiscovery, inter alia, on the facts that may or may not exist to support the claims and defenses set \nforth in the pleadings.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT: \n1.  This is an action for an award of damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, \nattorneys' fees and other relief on behalf of Plaintiff, Kate Lynn Blatt (\"Plaintiff'), a \nformer employee of Defendant, Cabela's Retail, Inc. (\"Defendant\"), who has been \nharmed by the Defendant's discriminatory employment practices. \n2.  This action arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§2000(e), et seq., as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, at 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) \n(\"Title VII\"), and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §12101, et seq. \n(\"ADA\"). \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE: \n3.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked, and venue is proper in this district, \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1391 as Plaintiffs claims are substantively based on \nTitle VII and the ADA. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 2 of 17\n4.  All conditions precedent to the institution of this suit have been fulfilled \nand Plaintiff has satisfied all jurisdictional prerequisites to the maintenance of this action. \nOn May 19, 2014, a Notice ofRight to Sue was issued by the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission and this action has been filed within ninety (90) days of receipt \nof said notice. \nIII.  PARTIES: \n5.  Plaintiff, Kate Lynn Blatt (\"PlaintiffBlatt\"), is a female and citizen of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, residing therein at 343 Nichols Street, Pottsville, \nPennsylvania 17901. \n6.  Defendant, Cabela's Retail, Inc. (\"Defendant\"), is a corporation duly \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska, maintaining a place of \nbusiness at 100 Cabela Drive, Hamburg, Pennsylvania 19526. \n7.  At all times relevant hereto, the Defendant was acting through its agents, \nservants, and employees, who were acting within the scope of their authority, course of \ntheir employment, and under the direct control of the Defendant. \n8.  At all times material herein, the Defendant is and has been a \"person\" and \n\"employer\" as defined under the ADA and Title VII and is accordingly subject to the \nprovisions of each said act. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 3 of 17\nIV.  STATEMENT OF CLAIMS: \n9.  At the time of her birth, Plaintiff Blatt's sex was designated male and her \nparents gave her the male name \"James.\" However, Plaintiff Blatt's male gender \ndesignation assigned to her at birth does not conform to her female gender identity. \n10.  In or about October of2005, PlaintiffBlatt was diagnosed with Gender \nDysphoria, also known as Gender Identity Disorder, a medical condition in which a \nperson's gender identity does not match his or her anatomical sex at birth. Said medical \ncondition is a disability within the meaning of the ADA in that it substantially impairs \none or more ofPlaintiffBlatt's major life activities, including, but not limited to, \ninteracting with others, reproducing, and social and occupational functioning. \n11.  As a result of her diagnosis, Plaintiff Blatt has taken steps to alter her \nphysical appearance to conform to her female gender identity, including dressing in \nfeminine attire, growing long hair, and engaging in hormone therapy in order to change \nher physical features. Additionally, Plaintiff Blatt has changed her name from \"James\" to \n\"Kate Lynn\" in order to conform to her correct gender. \n12.  Plaintiff Blatt was employed by the Defendant from on or about September \n17, 2006 until on or about March 1, 2007, the date of her unlawful termination. \n13.  During the course of her employment with the Defendant, Plaintiff Blatt \nheld the position of Seasonal Stocker, and at all times maintained an excellent job \nperfonnance rating in said capacity. \n14.  By way of background, Plaintiff Blatt was excited to begin her employment \nwith the Defendant, as she is an active participant in outdoor sports, and highly \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 4 of 17\nknowledgeable about the same. Plaintiff Blatt felt that employment with Defendant \nwould perfectly fit her skill set, knowledge, and interests. \n15.  At the commencement of her employment with Defendant, PlaintiffBlatt \nwas required to attend a two (2) to three (3) day orientation. During said orientation, \nPlaintiff Blatt dressed in female attire and used the female restroom without issue. \n16.  Immediately subsequent to orientation, Plaintiff Blatt was required to order \na uniform, and requested a female uniform as a reasonable accommodation for her \ndisability, as other female employees wore female uniforms. After failing to receive a \nresponse from the Defendant regarding the uniform, Plaintiff Blatt ordered and began to \nwear a female uniform. Additionally, Plaintiff Blatt requested a nametag that displayed \nher name, \"Kate Lynn,\" as an additional reasonable accommodation for her disability. \n17.  Shortly thereafter, Sandy Gates (\"Gates\"), Human Resources Director, \ndenied Plaintiff Blatt's request for a reasonable accommodation in the form ofnametag \nwith her name \"Kate Lynn.\" \n18.  Moreover, in retaliation for requesting said accommodation, Gates forced \nPlaintiff Blatt to wear a nametag stating that her name was \"James,\" allegedly because \nemployees were prohibited from wearing nametags depicting \"fictitious\" names. Gates \nfurther informed Plaintiff Blatt that she could obtain  a nametag reading \"Kate Lynn\" \nwhen her name and gender marker were legally changed, further retaliating against \nPlaintiff Platt for requesting an accommodation.  Curiously, numerous non \ntransgendered, male employees wore nametags depicting nicknames, such as \"Rocky,\" \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 5 of 17\n\"Bob,\" and \"Jim.\" Further, Gates required all employees of the Defendant to refer to \nPlaintiff Blatt as \"James\" or face termination. \n19.  Additionally, Gates further denied and retaliated against the Complainant \nfor requesting a reasonable accommodation by prohibiting Plaintiff Blatt from using the \nfemale restroom as she previously had until she provided Gates with documentation that \nher gender marker had been legally changed from male to female. Accordingly, Plaintiff \nBlatt was required to use the male restroom, a situation that was extremely uncomfortable \nfor her, as she identified as female. Plaintiff Blatt reluctantly agreed, although other \nfemale employees were at all times permitted to use the female restroom. \n20.  In or about early October of2006, Terry (LNU), Third Shift Manager, \nabruptly called Plaintiff Blatt into a meeting and accused her of failing to \"pull her \nweight.\" Terry further advised Plaintiff Blatt to consider leaving her employment with \nDefendant. Curiously, at all relevant times, Plaintiff Blatt's job performance was \nexcellent, and Terry's critiques were completely unjustified and discriminatory. \n21.  Immediately thereafter, numerous employees began subjecting Plaintiff \nBlatt to constant degrading and discriminatory comments on the basis of her sex. By way \nof example, Plaintiff Blatt was commonly referred to as \"he/she,\" \"ladyboy,\" \"fag,\" \n\"sinner,\" and \"freak.\" Egregiously, Plaintiff Blatt was often additionally subjected to \noffensive questions, such as \"Do you have a penis?\" \n22.  In response, Plaintiff Blatt continually reported the discriminatory conduct, \nboth verbally and in writing, to Lou Bowers (\"Bowers\"), Supervisor, who upon \ninformation and belief reported her complaints to the Defendant's upper level \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 6 of 17\nmanagement, and to Gates. However, Defendant failed to conduct an investigation or \ntake steps to cause said discriminatory conduct to cease. \n23.  Additionally, the Defendant treated Plaintiff Blatt significantly differently \nthan other similarly-situated, non-transgendered employees. By way of example, the \nDefendant required Plaintiff Blatt to remain secluded from other employees in one area \nof the store. Other Stockers stocked products throughout Defendant's store, while \nPlaintiff Blatt was required to stock only in Defendant's \"Gifts Department.\" Further, \nwhile other Stockers worked in teams, Plaintiff Blatt was consistently required to work \nby herself.Theseclusion Plaintiff Blatt experienced humiliated her and made her feel like \na lesser employee. \n24.  Further, Plaintiff Blatt was required to work on the third shift at all times. It \nis Plaintiff Blatt's belief that said requirement was enacted in order to keep her out of the \nsight of Defendant's customers. \n25.  In or about November of2006 and continuing throughout the course of her \nemployment, Plaintiff Blatt applied for several promotions with Defendant for which she \nwas well qualified. Although Plaintiff Blatt's job performance was exemplary, Defendant \nrefused to consider her for said positions. Significantly, Bowers informed Plaintiff Blatt \nthat Defendant's corporate office had explicitly instructed him not to promote Plaintiff \nBlatt, although he felt that she was well-qualified for the positions. \n26.  After applying for one of the aforesaid promotions, specifically the position \nof Maintenance Technician, Plaintiff Blatt overheard the current Maintenance Manager \nstate to Bowers, \"Can you believe this cross-dressing gay fruit wants a job in my \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 7 of 17\ndepartment? The confused sicko can't figure out that he is gay and admit it. I won't \ninterview him under any circumstances.\" Although Plaintiff Blatt reported said \ndiscriminatory comment to Gates, Defendant failed to take corrective action. \n27.  On or about January 29, 2007, an Order was entered in the Schuylkill \nCounty Court of Common Pleas to both legally change Plaintiff Blatt's name from \n\"James Benjamin Blatt\" to \"Kate Lynn Blatt,\" and change her gender designation from \nmale to female. \n28.  Immediately thereafter, Plaintiff Blatt provided Gates with a copy of \ndocumentation of the legal change of both her name and gender designation, and \nrequested the use of the female restroom as reasonable accommodation, as well as a new \nnametag depicting her legal name. In response, Gates informed Plaintiff Blatt that she \nwould need to send the information to Defendant's corporate office and receive a \nresponse before Plaintiff Blatt could start being treated as a woman. Said response came \nas an unwelcome surprise to Plaintiff Blatt, as Gates had previously assured her that she \nwould be able to change her nametag and use the female restroom as soon as her gender \ndesignation was legally changed. \n29.  Shortly thereafter, Gates blatantly denied Plaintiff Blatt's request to use the \nfemale restroom as reasonable accommodation, egregiously noting that because Plaintiff \nBlatt had not taken any time off from work, she could not have undergone sex \nreassignment surgery. Accordingly, Gates expressed her completely unfounded concern \nthat because Plaintiff Blatt was not anatomically female, she could potentially rape or \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 8 of 17\nsexually assault a person in the female restroom. Plaintiff Blatt was extremely offended \nand humiliated by Gates'scomments and beliefs. \n30.  Initially, in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation in the \nform of a gender-neutral restroom, Bowers informed Plaintiff Blatt that the prevailing \nidea presented during a staff meeting was to require Plaintiff Blatt to utilize the restroom \nat a Dunkin Donuts establishment across the street from Respondent's store. Plaintiff \nBlatt adamantly refused, as said requirement would force her to leave Defendant's store \nevery time she needed to use the restroom, and would subject her to humiliation based on \nthe Defendant's belief that she did not belong in the female restroom. Further, no other \nnon-transgendered, female employees were required to utilize the Dunkin Donuts \nrestroom. \n31.  As an alternative \"solution,\" Gates reluctantly permitted Plaintiff Blatt to \nuse the unisex \"family\" restroom in the front of Defendant's store. However, said \nrestroom was located approximately 400 to 500 feet away from Plaintiff Blatt's work \narea, which was significantly further than the employeerestrooms, and was much less \ncleanly than the employee restrooms. Further, walking to the family restroom caused \nPlaintiff Blatt severe embarrassment and feelings of ostracization. \n32.  Although Defendant did eventually issue Plaintiff Blatt a \"Kate Lynn\" \nnametag, Plaintiff Blatt was forced to repeatedly complain to Gates in an effort to attain \nsaid nametag. Defendant issued Plaintiff Blatt three (3) nametags with an incorrect name \nbefore providing her with a nametag reading \"Kate Lynn,\" which is her legal name, in an \nattempt to embarrass and degrade her. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 9 of 17\n33.  On or about February 26, 2007, Plaintiff Blatt was involved in an \naltercation with Mercedes Ramirez (\"Ramirez\"), Maintenance Technician. During said \naltercation, Plaintiff Blatt amicably approached Ramirez and asked her a question \nregarding her cleaning schedule. Ramirezresponded by berating Plaintiff Blatt for causing \na change in the restroom cleaningschedule, and verbally attacked her by yelling various \noffensive remarks and obscenities, including, but not limited to, \"You're not a real \nwoman and you never will be!\" Plaintiff Blatt was extremely upset and humiliated as a \nresult of said altercation. In response, Plaintiff Blatt immediately reported the incident to \nBowers. \n34.  On or about March 1, 2007, the Defendant abruptly terminated Plaintiff \nBlatt's employment with the Respondent, allegedly for threatening Ramirez's son during \nthe aforementioned altercation. However, Plaintiff Blatt never made any threats toward \nRamirez or her son, and in fact, was unaware that Ramirez even had a son. \n35.  Interestingly, Ramirez was neither terminated nor disciplined for her \ninvolvement in said altercation. \n36.  Plaintiff Blatt believes that Defendant's articulated reason for her \ntermination waspretextual and that her employment was actually terminated based on her \nsex, her actual and/or perceived disability and/or record of impairment, and in retaliation \nfor opposing unlawful discrimination in the workplace and requesting a reasonable \naccommodation for her disability. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 10 of 17\nCOUNT I \n(Title VII- Sex Discrimination, Hostile Work Environment) \nPlaintiff Blatt v. Defendant \n37.  PlaintiffBlatt incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 37 as though \nfully set forth at length herein. \n38.  The Defendant subjected Plaintiff Blatt to a hostile working environment \nand sex discrimination based on her gender and gender nonconformity, as detailed above. \n39.  The  hostile  work  environment  was  severe  and  pervasive  based  on  the \nnature of the harassment, including egregious statements made by numerous employees \nexpressing  animus  towards  Plaintiff Blatt's  gender  and  gender  nonconformity,  the \nconstant and unwavering harassment and derogatory comments towards Plaintiff Blatt \nbased  on  her  gender  and  gender  nonconformity,  and  Defendant's  blatant  denial  of \nPlaintiff Blatt's right to use the female restroom, as a female employee, because of her \ngender and gender nonconformity. \n40.  Plaintiff Blatt considered the aforementioned conduct to be discriminatory, \nand  reported  said  discriminatory  conduct,  both  verbally  and  in  writing,  to  numerous \nmanagement  level  employees  of Defendant,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Gates  and \nBowers. \n41.  Accordingly, Defendant was fully aware of the hostile work environment. \nHowever,  despite  Plaintiff Blatt's  numerous  complaints  of discrimination,  Defendant \nfailed to conduct an investigation or otherwise cause the discriminatory conduct to cease. \n42.  Rather  than  cause  the  discriminatory  conduct  to  cease,  Defendant \nterminated  Plaintiff  Blatt's  employment,  allegedly  due  to  an  altercation  with  an \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 11 of 17\nemployee.  However,  Defendant's reason  for  Plaintiff Blatt's termination is  pretextual, \nand  her  employment  was  actually  terminated  because  of  her  gender  and  gender \nnonconformity. \n43.  Accordingly, Defendant's discriminatory acts have deprived Plaintiff Blatt \nof equal employment opportunities because of her sex in violation of Title VII. \n44.  As a direct result of the aforesaid unlawful discriminatory employment \npractices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of Title VII, Plaintiff Blatt sustained \npermanent and irreparable harm, resulting in the loss of her employment, which caused \nher to sustain a loss of earnings, plus the value of certain benefits, plus loss of future \nearning power, plus back pay, and front pay and interest due thereon. \n45.  As  a  further  direct  result  of  the  aforesaid  unlawful  discriminatory \nemployment practices  engaged in by the Defendant in violation of Title VII,  Plaintiff \nBlatt suffered severe emotional distress,  embarrassment, humiliation,  and  loss  of self-\nesteem. \nCOUNT II \n(Title VII- Retaliation) \nPlaintiff Blatt v. Defendant \n46.  Plaintiff Blatt incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 45 as though \nfully set forth at length herein. \n4 7.  The actions of Defendant, through its agents, servants, and employees, in \nsubjecting Plaintiff Blatt to retaliation for opposing unlawful discrimination in the \nworkplace, constituted a violation of Title VII. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 12 of 17\n48.  Defendant terminated Plaintiff Blatt's employment in retaliation for \nregistering numerous complaints of discrimination in the workplace. \n49.  The reason articulated for Plaintiff Blatt's termination is pretextual, and her \nemployment was actually terminated in retaliation for opposing unlawful discrimination \nin the workplace. \n50.  As a direct result of the aforesaid unlawful retaliatory practices engaged in \nby  the  Defendant  in  violation  of Title  VII,  Plaintiff Blatt  sustained  permanent  and \nirreparable harm, resulting in the loss of her employment, which caused her to sustain a \nloss of earnings, plus the value of certain benefits, plus loss of future earning power, plus \nback pay, and front pay and interest due thereon. \n51.  As a further direct result of the aforesaid unlawful retaliatory employment \npractices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of Title VII, Plaintiff Blatt suffered \nsevere emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, and loss of self-esteem. \nCOUNT III \n(ADA- Disability Discrimination, Failure to Accommodate) \nPlaintiff Blatt v. Defendant \n52.  PlaintiffBlatt incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 51 of her \nComplaint as though fully set forth herein. \n53.  The actions of the Defendant, through its agents, servants and employees, \nin discriminating against Plaintiff Blatt on the basis of her actual and/or perceived \ndisabilities and/or record of impairment, and failing to provide reasonable \naccommodation for her disability, constituted violations of the ADA. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 13 of 17\n54.  As a direct result of the aforesaid unlawful discriminatory employment \npractices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of the ADA, Plaintiff Blatt sustained \npermanent and irreparable harm, resulting in her termination from employment, which \ncaused her to sustain a loss of earnings, plus the value of certain benefits, plus loss of \nfuture earning power, plus back pay, and front pay and interest due thereon. \n55.  As a further direct result of the aforesaid unlawful discriminatory \nemployment practices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of the ADA, Plaintiff \nBlatt suffered severe emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, and loss of self-\nesteem. \nCOUNT IV \n(ADA - Retaliation) \nPlaintiffv. the Defendant \n56.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 55 of her \nComplaint as though fully set forth herein. \n57.  The actions of the Defendant, through its agents, servants and employees, \nin retaliating against Plaintiff Blatt for requesting a reasonable accommodation, and for \nopposing unlawful disability discrimination in the workplace, constituted a violation of \nthe ADA. \n58.  As a direct result of the aforesaid unlawful retaliatory employment \npractices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of the ADA, Plaintiff Blatt sustained \npermanent and irreparable harm resulting in the termination of her employment, which \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JLS   Document 9   Filed 11/05/14   Page 14 of 17\ncaused her to sustain a loss of earnings, plus the value of certain benefits, plus loss of \nfuture earning power, plus back pay, front pay, and interest due thereon. \n59.  As a further direct result of the aforesaid unlawful retaliatory employment \npractices engaged in by the Defendant in violation of the ADA, Plaintiff Blatt suffered \nsevere emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, and loss of self-esteem. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n60.  Plaintiff Blatt incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 59 of her \nComplaint as though fully set forth at length herein. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Blatt requests that this Court enter judgment in her \nfavor and against the Defendant, and order that: \na.  Defendant compensate PlaintiffBlatt with a rate of pay and other benefits \nand emoluments of employment to which she would have been entitled had she not been \nsubjected to unlawful discrimination. \nb.

[and] gender identity disorders not resulting \nfrom physical impairments” from the ADA’s definition of “disability” (the “GID Exclusion”).  \nSee Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) (ECF No. 23); Notice of Constitutional \nQuestion (ECF No. 24).  The United States suggests that resolution of the constitutional \nchallenge to the GID Exclusion may be avoided as a matter of statutory construction.  As \n                                                 \n1 28 U.S.C. § 517 provides:  “The Solicitor General, or any other officer of the \nDepartment of Justice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United \nStates to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United \nStates, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.”  See 28 \nU.S.C. § 517. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 67   Filed 11/16/15   Page 2 of 7\nexplained below, under a reasonable interpretation of the statute, Plaintiff’s gender dysphoria \nfalls outside of the scope of the GID Exclusion because a growing body of scientific evidence \nsuggests that it may “result[] from [a] physical impairment[].”  This interpretation of the GID \nExclusion would allow the Court to avoid the constitutional question, and thus is compelled by \nthe doctrine of constitutional avoidance.2 \nIt is well-settled that, if possible, courts should avoid resolving cases on constitutional \ngrounds.  “If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of \nconstitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . \nunless such adjudication is unavoidable.”  Spector Motor Serv. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105 \n(1944); see also Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. 1 v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 204-06 (2009). \n“[W]hen deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider \nthe necessary consequences of its choice.  If one of them would raise a multitude of \nconstitutional problems, the other should prevail.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381-82 \n(2005); see also Siluk v. Merwin, 783 F.3d 421, 434 (3d Cir. 2015) (“If a statute can be construed \ntwo ways, ‘by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of \nwhich such questions are avoided,’ our duty is to ‘adopt the latter.’” (quoting United States v. \nEdmonds, 80 F.3d 810, 819 (3d Cir. 1996))). \nThe GID Exclusion excepts from the ADA’s definition of “disability” those “gender \nidentity disorders not resulting from physical impairments.”  42 U.S.C. § 12211(b) (emphasis \nadded).  The statute does not define the italicized phrase, nor does the legislative history shed \nany light.  But the applicable regulations broadly define the term “physical impairment” to mean \n                                                 \n2 The United States takes no position on the merits of Plaintiff’s ADA claim, including \nwhether plaintiff suffers “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \nmajor life activities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12102. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 67   Filed 11/16/15   Page 3 of 7\n“[a]ny physiological disorder or condition” affecting various body systems including \n“neurological,” “reproductive,” or “genitourinary.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  This definition is \nderived from the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, the federal-sector analogue to \nthe ADA.  See 56 Fed. Reg. 35694, 35698 (July 26, 1991).  Congress, in the ADA, required \ncourts “to construe the ADA to grant at least as much protection as provided by the regulations \nimplementing the Rehabilitation Act.”  Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631-32 (1998) (citing \n42 U.S.C. § 12201(a)).  And those regulations, which were in effect at the time that Congress \nwas considering the ADA, explain that the broad coverage of the term “physical impairment” \nwas designed to include “any condition which is . . . physical but whose precise nature is not at \npresent known,” 42 Fed. Reg. 22676, 22686 (May 4, 1977), thus leaving room for new scientific \ndevelopments. \nThis statutory and regulatory background makes clear that, as used in the GID Exclusion, \nthe phrase “resulting from a physical impairment” broadly encompasses GIDs rooted in biology \nor physiology, even if the precise etiology is not yet definitively understood.  In other words, the \nstatute distinguishes between two categories of GIDs:  those that have a physical cause and those \nthat do not.  Whether a particular GID falls within the scope of the GID Exclusion (and outside \nthe scope of the ADA’s protections) turns, then, on whether it “result[s] from [a] physical \nimpairment[]” – that is, whether it has a physical basis. \nAs the amici curiae point out, “the burgeoning medical research underlying [gender \ndysphoria] points to a physical etiology.”  See Br. of Amici Curiae at 15 & n.57 (ECF No. 26-1) \n(“[N]umerous medical studies conducted in the past six years . . . ‘point in the direction of \nhormonal and genetic causes for the in utero development of gender dysphoria.’” (quoting \nChristine Michelle Duffy, The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 67   Filed 11/16/15   Page 4 of 7\nAct of 1973, in GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION IN THE \nWORKPLACE:  A PRACTICAL GUIDE ch.16, at 16-72 to 16-74 & n.282  (Christine Michelle Duffy \ned. Bloomberg BNA 2014))); see also Aruna Saraswat, MD, Jamie D. Weinand, BA, BS & \nJoshua D. Safer, MD, Evidence Supporting the Biologic Nature of Gender Identity, 21 \nENDOCRINE PRACTICE 199, 199-202 (Feb.2, 2015) (providing a review of data in support of a \n“fixed, biologic basis for gender identity” and concluding that “current data suggest a biologic \netiology for transgender identity”); E.S. Smith, J. Junger, B. Derntil & U. Habel, The Transexual \nBrain – a Review of Findings on the Neural Basis of Transsexualism, NEUROSCIENCE AND \nBIOBEHAVORIAL REVIEWS  (2015) (unedited manuscript, accepted for publication) (citing \nnumerous studies and concluding that “[t]he available data from structural and functional \nneuroimaging-studies promote the view of transsexualism as a condition that has biological \nunderpinnings”).  While no clear scientific consensus appears to exist regarding the specific \norigins of gender dysphoria (i.e., whether it can be traced to neurological, genetic, or hormonal \nsources), the current research increasingly indicates that gender dysphoria has physiological or \nbiological roots. \nThis emerging scientific view must be assessed in light of the obligation to construe the \nADA’s protections broadly (and thus to treat the GID Exclusion narrowly).  Because “[t]he ADA \nis a remedial statute, designed to eliminate discrimination against the disabled in all facets of \nsociety, . . . it must be broadly construed to effectuate its purposes.”  Disabled in Action of Penn. \nv. Southeastern Penn. Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotations and \ncitation omitted).  This principle is reflected in the language of the statute itself.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(4)(A) (“The definition of disability in this chapter shall be construed in favor of broad \ncoverage of individuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 67   Filed 11/16/15   Page 5 of 7\nchapter.”).  And an exception – like the GID Exclusion – to a statute’s “‘general statement of \npolicy’ is sensibly read ‘narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the [policy].’”  \nCity of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 731 (1995) (quoting Commissioner v. \nClark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (1989)).  This approach is reinforced by the broad regulatory definition \nof “physical impairment” discussed above.  See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 632.   \nIn light of the evolving scientific evidence suggesting that gender dysphoria may have a \nphysical basis, along with the remedial nature of the ADA and the relevant statutory and \nregulatory provisions directing that the terms “disability” and “physical impairment” be read \nbroadly, the GID Exclusion should be construed narrowly such that gender dysphoria falls \noutside its scope.3  While the United States believes that this is the best interpretation of the \nstatute, it is, at the very least, a reasonable one.4  As such, the Court should adhere to the well-\nestablished doctrine of constitutional avoidance, should decline to address the constitutional \n                                                 \n3 Even assuming arguendo that current medical knowledge were to indicate that all \nknown GIDs “result[] from physical impairments,” that would not render the GID Exclusion \nmeaningless within the context of the ADA.  The statute continues to require that an asserted \nGID that does “not result[] from physical impairment” must be excluded from coverage.  If our \nevolving understanding of GIDs has changed the scope of the Exclusion, that would reflect the  \nADA’s own distinction between GIDs with a physical cause and those without such a cause – a \ndistinction drawn by Congress and inherent in the language of the GID Exclusion itself. \n \n4 The legislative history does not address the question of when a GID should be \nunderstood as “resulting from [a] physical impairment[],” such that it would fall outside the \nscope of the GID Exclusion.  The legislative history regarding the GID Exclusion comes from \ndebate of the ADA on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but the version of the Exclusion being \nconsidered at that time did not include an exception for GIDs resulting from physical \nimpairments.  See 135 Cong. Rec. S10765-01, 1989 WL 183216, at *S10785 (Sept. 7, 1989).  \nThat language was added by the House late in the legislative process, with little explanation.  See \nPl.’s Opp’n at 14-15 (discussing the origin of the “not resulting from physical impairments” \nlanguage and the absence of legislative history).  Whatever Congress intended, “it is ultimately \nthe provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are \ngoverned.”  Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998) (explaining that \nwhile Congress might not have had “male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace” in mind \nwhen enacting Title VII, such conduct still falls within the statute’s plain text and thus within its \npurview). \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:14-cv-04822-JFL   Document 67   Filed 11/16/15   Page 6 of 7\nchallenge to the GID Exclusion, and should instead adopt this proposed construction, under \nwhich Plaintiff’s gender dysphoria would not be excluded from the ADA’s definition of \n“disability.”5   \n \n \nDated:  November 16, 2015      Respectfully submitted, \nBENJAMIN C.
