    "summary": "<p>On November 20, 2013, Belmont Abbey College, a Catholic liberal arts college, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), and the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), against the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury.  The plaintiff, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that federal rules adopted pursuant to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) violated its religious freedom by requiring it to provide coverage for contraception through its group health insurance plan. Claiming that providing coverage for contraception would both contravene its Catholic faith and compel speech contrary to its beliefs, the plaintiff sought an exemption from the ACA's contraception mandate for itself and other institutions with similar religious objections. </p><p>The plaintiff's complaint was substantially similar to one it had filed in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12702\">Belmont Abbey College v. Sebelius [II]</a>, which was dismissed on August 13, 2013 because the contraception mandate had not yet harmed the plaintiffs. </p><p>On January 29, 2014, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to stay this case pending the Supreme Court's resolution of <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14373\">Priests for Life v. Sebelius</a> (later consolidated as <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13462\">Zubik v. Sebelius [II] </a>, and heard by the Supreme Court in 2016). On November 3, 2014, the plaintiffs, for unspecified reasons, filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. </p>",

This is a challenge to regulations issued under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act that force employee health insurance plans to provide free coverage of contraceptives, \nsterilizations, and drugs and devices that cause early abortions (the “Final Mandate”). \n2.  Plaintiff Belmont Abbey College is a private Catholic college founded and operated by \nBenedictine monks.  The College “finds its center in Jesus Christ.”1  Belmont Abbey College is \n“guided by the Catholic intellectual tradition and the Benedictine spirit of prayer and learning,” \nand its mission is “to educate students in the liberal arts and sciences so that in all things God \nmay be glorified.” See id. \n3.  Consistent  with  traditional  Catholic  teaching  on  the  sanctity  of  life  and  sexuality, \nBelmont  Abbey  College  believes  and  teaches  that  abortion,  sterilization,  and  the  use  of \ncontraceptives  to  prevent  pregnancy  are  morally  unacceptable.  Belmont  Abbey  College’s \nreligious convictions forbid it from participating in, paying for, designating others to pay for, \ntraining others to engage in, or otherwise supporting or facilitating access to, contraception, \nsterilization, or abortion.    \n4.  In light of these religious beliefs, Belmont Abbey College cannot participate in the \ngovernment’s regulatory scheme to promote, encourage, and subsidize the use of sterilization, \n                                                 \n1 See Belmont Abbey, President Home, Vision Statement, http://www.belmontabbeycollege.edu/ \npresident/vision-statement.aspx (last visited Oct. 29, 2013). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 3 of 48\ncontraceptives, and drugs and devices that cause abortions.  Under the Final Mandate, however, \nBelmont Abbey College faces millions of dollars in fines for this religious exercise. \n5.  The government defendants have exempted thousands of plans, covering tens of millions \nof employees, from the Final Mandate.  These exemptions have been granted for a wide variety \nof  reasons, from the purely secular exemption for plans in existence before a certain date \n(“grandfathered plans”) to a narrow religious exemption for certain “religious employers.”   \n6.  Despite its obvious religious nature, and despite the fact that Belmont Abbey College is \nstill operated in part by an order of Benedictine monks, Belmont Abbey College does not qualify \nfor any exemptions.  While “religious employers” are exempted, Defendants have limited that \nexemption to protect only “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations \nof churches” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” That is because, in \nthe eyes of the government, the monks’ work educating students in “the Catholic intellectual \ntradition and the Benedictine spirit of prayer and learning” is not an “exclusively religious \nactivity.” \n7.  The  regulations  do  offer  Belmont  Abbey  College  and  other  non-exempt  religious \norganizations what the defendants have labeled an “accommodation.” But the “accommodation” \nstill requires Belmont Abbey College to play a central role in the government’s scheme, because \nit must designate an agent to pay for the objectionable services on Belmont Abbey College’s \nbehalf, and it has to take steps to trigger and facilitate that coverage.  Belmont Abbey College \ncannot take these actions to facilitate this coverage without violating its religion. \n8.  The supposed “accommodation” also continues to treat Belmont Abbey College as a \nsecond-class religious organization, not entitled to the same religious freedom rights as other \n2 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 4 of 48\nreligious  organizations,  including  any  religious  schools  that  are  “integrated  auxiliaries”  of \nchurches.  \n9.  The  “accommodation”  also  creates  administrative  hurdles  and  other  difficulties  for \nBelmont Abbey College, forcing it to seek out and contract with companies willing to provide \nthe very drugs and services it speaks out against. \n10. If Belmont Abbey College does not compromise its religious convictions and comply \nwith the regulations, however, it faces severe penalties that could exceed $7.6 million each year. \n11. By placing Belmont Abbey College in this impossible position, Defendants have violated \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as well as the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free \nSpeech Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, The Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. \n12. Belmont  Abbey  College  therefore  respectfully  requests  declaratory  and  permanent \ninjunctive relief. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1361. This \naction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This Court has jurisdiction to \nrender declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb-1. \n14. Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). A substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District, and the Defendants are located in \nthis District. \n3 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 5 of 48\nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES \n15.

Belmont  Abbey  College’s  Religious  Beliefs  and  Practices  Related  to  Insurance  for \nContraception, Sterilization, and Abortion. \n \n23. Belmont Abbey College is a small liberal arts school located outside of Charlotte, North \nCarolina.  It was founded in 1876 by a congregation of Benedictine monks, who built the campus \nwith bricks they formed by hand from the red clay of the North Carolina soil. \n24.  Today, the monastery operates in the center of campus, and the monks of the Abbey \ncontinue to live on Belmont Abbey College’s campus and sponsor it. They provide significant \nfinancial support for Belmont Abbey College, and the monks also serve on the Board of Trustees \nthat governs Belmont Abbey College. The head of the monastery, Abbot Placid Solari, serves as \nBelmont Abbey College’s Chancellor, and other monks serve as teachers, administrators, and \nchaplains.    \n25. Faith is central to the educational mission of Belmont Abbey College. Belmont Abbey \nCollege describes itself as a Catholic Benedictine College that “finds its center in Jesus Christ” \nand is “led by St. Benedict’s desire ‘that in all things God may be glorified.’”2  \n26. Belmont Abbey College’s purpose is expressed in its mission statement: “Our mission is \nto educate students in the liberal arts and sciences so that in all things God may be glorified. In \nthis endeavor, we are guided by the Catholic intellectual tradition and the Benedictine spirit of \nprayer  and  learning.  Exemplifying  Benedictine  hospitality,  we  welcome  a  diverse  body  of \nstudents and provide them with an education that will enable them to lead lives of integrity, to \n                                                 \n2  Belmont  Abbey,  President  Home,  Vision  Statement,  http://www.belmontabbeycollege.edu/ \npresident/vision-statement.aspx (last visited Oct. 29, 2013).  \n5 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 7 of 48\nsucceed professionally, to become responsible citizens, and to be a blessing to themselves and to \nothers.”3  \n27. Belmont Abbey College adheres to the Apostolic Constitution Ex Corde Ecclesiae of \nPope John Paul II, which is the relevant law of the Roman Catholic Church for Catholic colleges \nand universities.4   \n28.   Ex  Corde  Ecclesiae  requires  all  Catholic  universities  to  have  among  its  “essential \ncharacteristics . . . fidelity to the Christian message as it comes to us through the Church.”  \nAccordingly, Belmont Abbey College strives to reflect “[f]idelity to the Christian message as it \ncomes to us through the Church” in all aspects of its teaching.5  \n29. Ex Corde Ecclesiae also requires Catholic universities to reflect “[a] Christian inspiration \n. . . of the whole college community.” Id. Accordingly, Abbot Placid interviews all prospective \nfaculty members to discover how they will make Belmont Abbey College’s vision of “find[ing] \nour center in Jesus Christ” apparent in their teaching, and how they will further Belmont Abbey \nCollege’s mission of being a Catholic and Benedictine college. Id.  \n30. As a Catholic institution, Belmont Abbey College holds religious beliefs that include \ntraditional Catholic  teachings  on  the  sanctity of  life.  Belmont  Abbey  College  believes  and \nteaches that each human being bears the image and likeness of God, and therefore that all human \n                                                 \n3  Belmont  Abbey  College,  Mission  Statement,  http://www.belmontabbeycollege.edu/ \nvisionstatement/mission-statement.aspx (last visited Oct. 29, 2013). \n4  See  Pope  John  Paul  II,  Apostolic  Constitution  on  Catholic  Universities  (1990), \nhttp://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-\nii_apc_15081990_ex-corde-ecclesiae_en.html. \n5  Belmont  Abbey  College,  Abbott  Placid  Solari,  http://www.belmontabbeycollege.edu/ \nchancellor/interview.aspx (last visited Oct. 29, 2013). \n6 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 8 of 48\nlife is sacred and precious, from the moment of conception. Belmont Abbey College therefore \nbelieves and teaches that abortion ends a human life and is a grave sin. \n31.  Belmont Abbey College’s religious beliefs also include traditional Catholic teaching on \nthe nature and purpose of human sexuality. In particular, Belmont Abbey College believes, in \naccordance with Pope Paul VI’s 1968 encyclical, Humanae Vitae, that human sexuality has two \nprimary purposes: “uniting husband and wife in the closest intimacy” and “for the generation and \nrearing of new lives.”6 Accordingly, Belmont Abbey College believes, with the Catholic Church, \nthat “[t]o use this divine gift while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and \npurpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in \nopposition to the plan of God and His holy will.” Id. Therefore, Belmont Abbey College believes \nand teaches that “any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is \nspecifically intended to prevent procreation—whether as an end or as a means”—including \ncontraception and sterilization—is a grave sin. \n32.  Because of its religious convictions concerning the sanctity of life, Belmont Abbey \nCollege cannot participate in any scheme to facilitate access to drugs and services that cause \nabortions, sterilizations, or deliberately prevent a pregnancy. \n33. Belmont Abbey College has approximately 1,600 students. \n34. Belmont Abbey College has approximately 200 full-time and 130 part-time employees.  \n35. As part of its commitment to Catholic education, in accordance with Catholic social \nteaching, Belmont Abbey College also promotes the well-being and health of its students and \nemployees.  This includes provision of on-campus health services for its students and employees.  \n                                                 \n6  Pope  Paul  VI,  Humanae  Vitae  (1968),  http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/ \nencyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html. \n7 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 9 of 48\n36. Also as a part of this religious commitment, Belmont Abbey College provides insurance \npolicies to its full-time faculty and staff.   \n37. As part of its religious commitment, Belmont Abbey College ensures that its insurance \npolicies  do  not  cover  drugs,  devices,  services  or  procedures  inconsistent  with  its  faith.  In \nparticular, its insurance plans do not cover sterilization, contraception, or abortion. \n38. Belmont  Abbey  College’s  religious  beliefs  prohibit  it  from  deliberately  providing \ninsurance coverage for drugs, devices, services or procedures inconsistent with its faith—in \nparticular, sterilization, contraception, or abortion. \n39. Nor would Belmont Abbey College’s religious beliefs permit it to deliberately provide \nhealth insurance that would facilitate access to sterilization, contraception, or abortion, or related \neducation and counseling—even if those items are paid for by an insurer or designee and not by \nBelmont Abbey College. \n40. Many of Belmont Abbey College’s employees and students choose to work at or attend \nBelmont Abbey College because they share its religious beliefs and wish to help Belmont Abbey \nCollege further its mission. Belmont Abbey College would violate their implicit trust in the \norganization and detrimentally alter its relationship with them if it were to violate its religious \nbeliefs regarding abortion, sterilization, and contraceptives. \nII. The Affordable Care Act and Preventive Care Mandate \n41. In March 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), and the Health Care and \nEducation Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. 111-152 (March 30, 2010), collectively known as the \n“Affordable Care Act.” \n8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 10 of 48\n42.  The Affordable Care Act regulates the national health insurance market by directly \nregulating “group health plans” and “health insurance issuers.” \n43.  One provision of the Act mandates that any “group health plan” or “health insurance \nissuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage” must provide coverage for certain \npreventive care services. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a). \n44.  The services required to be covered include medications, screenings, and counseling \ngiven an “A” or “B” rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force;7 immunizations \nrecommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention;  and  “preventive  care  and  screenings”  specific  to  infants,  children, \nadolescents, and women, as to be “provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(1)-(4).  \n45.  The statute specifies that all of these services must be provided without “any cost \nsharing.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).  \n  The Interim Final Rule \n46.  On July 19, 2010, HHS8 published an interim final rule imposing regulations concerning \nthe Affordable Care Act’s requirement for coverage of preventive services without cost sharing. \n75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41728 (2010).  \n                                                 \n7 The list of services that currently have an “A” or “B” rating include medications like aspirin for \npreventing cardiovascular disease, vitamin D, and folic acid; screenings for a wide range of \nconditions such as depression, certain cancers and sexually-transmitted diseases, intimate partner \nviolence, obesity, and osteoporosis; and various counseling services, including for breastfeeding, \nsexually-transmitted diseases, smoking, obesity, healthy dieting, cancer, and so forth. See U.S. \nPreventive  Services  Task  Force,  USPSTF  A  and  B  Recommendations, \nhttp://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsabrecs.htm (last visited Nov. 19, 2013) \n(Ex. A); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41740 (2010). \n8 For ease of reading, references to “HHS” in this Complaint refer to all Defendants, unless \ncontext indicates otherwise. \n9 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 11 of 48\n47.  The interim final rule was enacted without prior notice of rulemaking or opportunity for \npublic comment, because Defendants determined for themselves that “it would be impracticable \nand contrary to the public interest to delay putting the provisions . . . in place until a full public \nnotice and comment process was completed.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41730. \n48.  Although Defendants suggested in the Interim Final Rule that they would solicit public \ncomments  after  implementation,  they  stressed  that  “provisions  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act \nprotect  significant  rights”  and  therefore  it  was  expedient  that  “participants,  beneficiaries, \ninsureds, plan sponsors, and issuers have certainty about their rights and responsibilities.” Id. \n49.  Defendants  stated  they  would  later  “provide  the  public  with  an  opportunity  for \ncomment, but without delaying the effective date of the regulations,” demonstrating their intent \nto impose the regulations regardless of the legal flaws or general opposition that might be \nmanifest in public comments. Id. \n50.  In  addition  to  reiterating  the  Affordable  Care  Act’s  preventive  services  coverage \nrequirements, the Interim Final Rule provided further guidance concerning the Act’s restriction \non cost sharing. \n51.  The  Interim  Final  Rule  makes  clear  that  “cost  sharing”  refers  to  “out-of-pocket” \nexpenses for plan participants and beneficiaries. 75 Fed. Reg. at 41730. \n52.  The Interim Final Rule acknowledges that, without cost sharing, expenses “previously \npaid out-of-pocket” would “now be covered by group health plans and issuers” and that those \nexpenses would, in turn, result in “higher average premiums for all enrollees.” Id.; see also id. at \n41737 (“Such a transfer of costs could be expected to lead to an increase in premiums.”) \n10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 12 of 48\n53.  In other words, the prohibition on cost-sharing was simply a way “to distribute the cost \nof preventive services more equitably across the broad insured population.” 75 Fed. Reg. at \n41730. \n54.  After the Interim Final Rule was issued, numerous commenters warned against the \npotential conscience implications of requiring religious individuals and organizations to include \ncertain kinds of services—specifically  contraception, sterilization, and abortion services—in \ntheir health care plans. \n55.  HHS directed a private health policy organization, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), to \nmake recommendations regarding which drugs, procedures, and services should be considered in \ncomprehensive guidelines for preventive care for women.  \n56.  IOM was not tasked with making insurance coverage recommendations and explicitly \nexcluded cost considerations and other considerations relevant to coverage recommendations \nfrom its determinations regarding effective preventive care for women. \n57.  In  developing  its  guidelines,  IOM  invited  a  select  number  of  groups  to  make \npresentations on the preventive care that should be mandated by all health plans. These were the \nGuttmacher Institute, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), John \nSantelli,  the  National  Women’s  Law  Center,  National  Women’s  Health  Network,  Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, and Sara Rosenbaum.  \n58.  No religious groups or other groups that opposed government-mandated coverage of \ncontraception,  sterilization,  abortion,  and  related  education  and  counseling  were among  the \ninvited presenters. \n59.  On  July  19,  2011,  the  IOM  published  its  preventive  care  guidelines  for  women, \nincluding a recommendation that preventive services include all “Food and Drug Administration \n11 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 13 of 48\napproved contraceptive methods [and] sterilization procedures.” Institute of Medicine, Clinical \nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, at 102-10 and Recommendation 5.5 (2011). \n60.  FDA-approved  contraceptive  methods  include  birth-control  pills;  prescription \ncontraceptive devices such as IUDs; Plan B (also known as the “morning-after pill”); ulipristal \n(also known as “ella” or the “week-after pill”); and other drugs, devices, and procedures.  \n61.  Some of these drugs and devices—including the “emergency contraceptives” Plan B and \nella and certain IUDs—are known abortifacients, in that they can cause the death of an embryo \nby preventing it from implanting in the wall of the uterus.  \n62.  Indeed, the FDA’s own Birth Control guide states that both Plan B and ella can work by \n“preventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus).”9  \n63.  On August 1, 2011, thirteen days after IOM issued its recommendations, HRSA issued \nguidelines adopting them in full.10  \nThe “Religious Employers” Exemption \n64.  That same day, HHS promulgated an additional Interim Final Rule. 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 \n(published Aug. 3, 2011). \n65.  This Second Interim Final Rule granted HRSA “discretion to exempt certain religious \nemployers  from  the  Guidelines  where  contraceptive  services  are  concerned.”  76  Fed.  Reg. \n46621, 46623 (emphasis added). The term “religious employer” was restrictively defined as one \nthat (1) has as its purpose the “inculcation of religious values”; (2) “primarily employs persons \nwho share the religious tenets of the organization”; (3) “serves primarily persons who share the \n                                                 \n9 FDA, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You, http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ \nForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm (last visited Nov. 19, 2013) (Ex. B). \n10  HRSA,  Women’s  Preventive  Services  Guidelines,  http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines \n(last visited Nov. 19, 2013) (Ex. C). \n12 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 14 of 48\nreligious tenets of the organization”; and (4) “is a nonprofit organization as described in section \n6033(a)(1)  and  section  6033(a)(3)(A)(i)  or  (iii)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as \namended.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46626.  \n66.  The fourth of these requirements refers to “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and \nconventions or associations of churches” and the “exclusively religious activities of any religious \norder.” 26 U.S.C.A. § 6033.  \n67.  Thus, the “religious employers” exemption was severely limited to formal churches, \ntheir integrated auxiliaries, and religious orders whose purpose is to inculcate faith and that hire \nand serve primarily people of their own faith tradition. \n68.  HRSA exercised its discretion to grant an exemption for religious employers via a \nfootnote on its website listing the Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines. The footnote states \nthat “guidelines concerning contraceptive methods and counseling described above do not apply \nto women who are participants or beneficiaries in group health plans sponsored by religious \nemployers.” 11   \n69.  Although religious organizations like Belmont Abbey College share the same religious \nbeliefs and concerns as objecting churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and objecting religious \norders—including the order of Benedictine monks that sponsors Belmont Abbey College—HHS \ndeliberately ignored the regulation’s impact on their religious liberty, stating that the exemption \nsought only “to provide for a religious accommodation that respects the unique relationship \nbetween a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46623. \n70.   Thus, thousands of religious organizations that cannot comply with the mandate for \nreligious reasons were excluded from the “religious employers” exemption.  \n                                                 \n11 HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines. \n13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 15 of 48\n71.  Like the original Interim Final Rule, the Second Interim Final Rule was made effective \nimmediately, without prior notice or opportunity for public comment.  \n72.  Defendants acknowledged that “while a general notice of proposed rulemaking and an \nopportunity for public comment is generally required before promulgation of regulations,” they \nhad “good cause” to conclude that public comment was “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \nto the public interest” in this instance. 76 Fed. Reg. at 46624. \n73.  Upon information and belief, after the Second Interim Final Rule was put into effect, \nover 100,000 comments were submitted opposing the narrow scope of the “religious employers” \nexemption  and  protesting  the  contraception  mandate’s  gross  infringement  on  the  rights  of \nreligious individuals and organizations. \n74.  HHS did not take into account the concerns of religious organizations in the comments \nsubmitted before the Second Interim Rule was issued.  \n75.  Instead the Second Interim Rule was unresponsive to the concerns, including claims of \nstatutory and constitutional conscience rights, stated in the comments submitted by religious \norganizations. \nThe Safe Harbor \n76.  The public outcry for a broader religious employer exemption continued for many \nmonths and, on January 20, 2013, HHS issued a press release acknowledging “the important \nconcerns some have raised about religious liberty” and stating that religious objectors would be \n“provided an additional year . . . to comply with the new law.”12  \n                                                 \n12 Press Release, A Statement by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary \nKathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html \n(Ex. D). \n14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 16 of 48\n77.  On  February  10,  2012,  HHS  formally  announced  a  “safe  harbor”  for  non-exempt \nnonprofit religious organizations that objected to covering free contraceptive and abortifacient \nservices. HHS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, Guidance on the \nTemporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers (Feb. 10, 2012); see also HHS \nCenter  for  Consumer  Information  and  Insurance  Oversight,  Guidance  on  the  Temporary \nEnforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers (Aug. 15, 2012) (changing the safe harbor \neligibility criteria). \n78.  Under the safe harbor, HHS agreed it would not take any enforcement action against an \neligible organization during the safe harbor, which would remain in effect until the first plan year \nbeginning on or after August 1, 2013. HHS later extended the safe harbor to the first plan year \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2014. HHS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance \nOversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers (June \n28, 2013). \n79.  HHS  also  indicated  it  would  develop  and  propose  changes  to  the  regulations  to \naccommodate the objections of non-exempt, nonprofit religious organizations following August \n1, 2013.  \n80.  Despite the safe harbor and HHS’s accompanying promises, on February 15, 2012, HHS \npublished a final rule “finaliz[ing], without change,” the contraception and abortifacient mandate \nand narrow religious employers exemption. 77 Fed. Reg. 8725-01 (published Feb. 15, 2012).  \nThe Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n81.  On  March  21,  2012,  HHS  issued  an  Advance  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking \n(ANPRM), presenting “questions and ideas” to “help shape” a discussion of how to “maintain \n15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 17 of 48\nthe  provision  of  contraceptive  coverage  without  cost  sharing,”  while  accommodating  the \nreligious beliefs of non-exempt religious organizations. 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (2012).  \n82.  The ANPRM conceded that forcing religious organizations to “contract, arrange, or pay \nfor” the objectionable contraceptive and abortifacient servicers would infringe their “religious \nliberty interests.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n83.  In vague terms, the ANPRM proposed that the “health insurance issuers” for objecting \nreligious  employers  could  be  required  to  “assume  the  responsibility  for  the  provision  of \ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing.” Id.  \n84.  For  self-insured  plans,  the  ANPRM  suggested  that  third  party  plan  administrators \n“assume this responsibility.” Id.  \n85.  For the first time, and contrary to the earlier definition of “cost sharing,” Defendants \nsuggested in the ANPRM that insurers and third party administrators could be prohibited from \npassing along their costs to the objecting religious organizations via increased premiums. See id.  \n86.  “[A]pproximately 200,000 comments” were submitted in response to the ANPRM. 78 \nFed. Reg. 8456, 8459 (published February 6, 2013). Many of these comments reiterated previous \ncomments that the ANPRM’s proposals would not resolve conscientious objections, because the \nobjecting religious organizations, by providing a health care plan in the first instance, would still \nbe coerced to arrange for and facilitate access to religiously-objectionable drugs and services. \nThe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n87.  On  February  1,  2013,  HHS  issued  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM) \npurportedly addressing the comments submitted in response to the ANPRM. 78 Fed. Reg. 8456. \n88.  The NPRM proposed two changes to the then-existing regulations. 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, \n8458-59. \n16 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 18 of 48\n89.  First,  it  proposed  revising  the  religious  employers  exemption  by  eliminating  the \nrequirements  that  religious  employers  have  the  purpose of  inculcating  religious  values  and \nprimarily employ and serve only persons of their same faith. 78 Fed. Reg. at 8461 \n90.  Under this proposal a “religious employer” would be one “that is organized and operates \nas a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or [](iii) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8474.  \n91.  HHS  emphasized,  however,  that  this  proposal  “would  not  expand  the  universe  of \nemployer plans that would qualify for the exemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 \nfinal rules.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8461.  \n92.  In other words, religious organizations like Belmont Abbey College that are not formal \nchurches would continue to be excluded from the exemption.  \n93.  Second, the NPRM reiterated HHS’s intention to “accommodate” non-exempt, nonprofit \nreligious organizations by making them “designate” their insurers to provide plan participants \nand beneficiaries with free access to contraceptive and abortifacient drugs and services. \n94.  The proposed “accommodation” did not resolve the concerns of religious organizations \nlike Belmont Abbey College because it continued to force them to deliberately provide health \ninsurance  and  take  actions  that  would  trigger  access  to religiously-objectionable  drugs  and \nrelated education and counseling. \n95.  In issuing the NPRM, HHS requested comments from the public by April 8, 2013. 78 \nFed. Reg. at 8457. \n96.  “[O]ver 400,000 comments” were submitted in response to the NPRM, 78 Fed. Reg. \n39870,  39871  (published  July  2,  2013),  with  religious  organizations  again  overwhelmingly \ndecrying the proposed accommodation as a gross violation of their religious liberty because it \n17 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 19 of 48\nwould  conscript  their  health  care  plans  as  the  main  cog  in  the  government’s  scheme  for \nexpanding access to contraceptive and abortifacient services. \n97.  Belmont Abbey College submitted comments on the NPRM, stating essentially the same \nobjections stated in this complaint. \n98.  On  April  8,  2013,  the  same  day  the  notice-and-comment  period  ended,  Defendant \nSecretary  Sebelius  answered  questions  about  the  contraceptive  and  abortifacient  services \nrequirement in a presentation at Harvard University. \n99.  In her remarks, Secretary Sebelius stated:  \nWe  have  just  completed  the  open  comment  period  for  the  so-called \naccommodation, and by August 1st of this year, every employer will be covered \nby the law with one exception. Churches and church dioceses as employers are \nexempted from this benefit. But Catholic hospitals, Catholic universities, other \nreligious entities will be providing coverage to their employees starting August \n1st. . . . [A]s of August 1st, 2013, every employee who doesn’t work directly for a \nchurch or a diocese will be included in the benefit package.13 \n100. It is clear from the timing of these remarks that Defendants gave no consideration to the \ncomments submitted in response to the NPRM’s proposed “accommodation.” \nThe Final Mandate \n101. On June 28, 2013, Defendants issued a final rule (the “Final Mandate”), which ignores \nthe objections repeatedly raised by religious organizations and continues to co-opt objecting \nreligious employers into the government’s scheme of expanding free access to contraceptive and \nabortifacient services. 78 Fed. Reg. 39870. \n                                                 \n13 The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health, A Conversation with Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. \nSecretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Apr.  8,  2013,  http://theforum.sph.harvard. \nedu/events/conversation-kathleen-sebelius (last visited Nov. 19, 2013) (from 51:20 to 53:56) \n(emphases added) (Ex. E). A permanent link to the relevant section of Sec. Sebelius’ remarks is \navailable here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6aSwQl-2g&feature=youtu.be (last visited \nNov. 19, 2013). \n18 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 20 of 48\n102. Under the Final Mandate, the discretionary “religious employers” exemption, which is \nstill implemented via footnote on the HRSA website, Ex. C, remains limited to formal churches \nand religious orders “organized and operate[d]” as nonprofit entities and “referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n103. All other religious organizations, including Belmont Abbey College, are excluded from \nthe exemption.  \n104. The  Final  Mandate  creates  a  separate  “accommodation”  for  certain  non-exempt \nreligious organizations. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n105. An  organization  is  eligible  for  the  accommodation  if  it  (1)  “[o]pposes  providing \ncoverage for some or all of the contraceptive services required”; (2) “is organized and operates \nas a nonprofit entity”; (3) “holds itself out as a religious organization”; and (4) “self-certifies that \nit satisfies the first three criteria.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n106. The self-certification must be executed “prior to the beginning of the first plan year to \nwhich an accommodation is to apply.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39875.  \n107. The Final Rule extends the current safe harbor through the end of 2013. 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39889; see also HHS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, Guidance on \nthe Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers (June 28, 2013) (extending the \nsafe harbor to the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2014).  \n108. Thus, an eligible organization would need to execute the self-certification prior to its \nfirst plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2014, and deliver it to the organization’s insurer \nor, if the organization has a self-insured plan, to the plan’s third party administrator. 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 39875. \n19 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 21 of 48\n109. By  the  terms  of  the  accommodation,  Belmont  Abbey  College  will  be  required  to \nexecute the self-certification and deliver it to its insurer before December 1, 2014. \n110. By delivering its self-certification to its insurer, Belmont Abbey College would trigger \nthe insurer’s obligation to make “separate payments for contraceptive services directly for plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39875-76. \n111. Belmont Abbey College would have to identify its employees to the insurer for the \ndistinct purpose of enabling the government’s scheme to facilitate free access to contraceptive \nand abortifacient services. \n112. The  insurer’s  obligation  to  make  direct  payments  for  contraceptive  and  abortion \nservices would continue only “for so long as the participant or beneficiary remains enrolled in \nthe plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876. \n113. Thus Belmont Abbey College would have to coordinate with its insurer regarding when \nit was adding or removing employees and beneficiaries from its healthcare plan and, as a result, \nfrom the contraceptive, sterilization, and abortifacient services payment scheme. \n114. Insurers  would  be  required  to  notify  plan  participants  and  beneficiaries  of  the \ncontraceptive payment benefit “contemporaneous with (to the extent possible) but separate from \nany application materials distributed in connection with enrollment” in a group health plan. 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39876.  \n115. This would also require Belmont Abbey College to coordinate the notices with its \ninsurer. \n116. The insurer would be required to provide the contraceptive benefits “in a manner \nconsistent” with the provision of other covered services. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876-77.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 22 of 48\n117. Thus, any payment or coverage disputes presumably would be resolved under the terms \nof Belmont Abbey College’s existing plan documents. \n118. Thus, even under the accommodation, Belmont Abbey College and every other non-\nexempt objecting religious organization would continue to play a central role in facilitating free \naccess to contraceptive, sterilization, and abortifacient services. \n119. Under the accommodation, issuers “may not impose any cost-sharing requirements \n(such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any premium, fee, or other \ncharge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization.” 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 39896 (emphasis added). \n120. For all other preventive services, including non-contraceptive preventive services for \nwomen, only cost-sharing (i.e., out-of-pocket expense) is prohibited. There is no restriction on \npassing along costs via premiums or other charges. \n121. Defendants state that they “continue to believe, and have evidence to support,” that \nproviding payments for contraceptive and abortifacient services will be “cost neutral for issuers,” \nbecause “[s]everal studies have estimated that the costs of providing contraceptive coverage are \nbalanced  by  cost  savings  from  lower  pregnancy-related  costs  and  from  improvements  in \nwomen’s health.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877.  \n122. On information and belief, the studies Defendants rely upon to support this claim are \nseverely flawed.  \n123. Nevertheless, even if the payments were—over time—to become cost neutral, it is \nundisputed that there will be up-front costs for making the payments. See, e.g., 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39877-78 (addressing ways insurers can cover up-front costs). \n21 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 23 of 48\n124. Moreover, if cost savings arise that make insuring an employer’s employees cheaper, \nthe savings would have to be passed on to employers through reduced premiums, not retained by \ninsurance issuers. \n125. HHS suggests that, to maintain cost neutrality, issuers may simply ignore this fact and \n“set  the  premium  for  an  eligible  organization’s  large  group  policy  as  if  no  payments  for \ncontraceptive services had been provided to plan participants.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877.  \n126. This encourages issuers to artificially inflate the eligible organization’s premiums.  \n127. Under this methodology—even assuming its legality—the eligible organization would \nstill bear the cost of the required payments for contraceptive, sterilization, and abortifacient \nservices in violation of its conscience, as if the accommodation had never been made. \n128. Defendants  have  suggested  that  “[a]nother  option”  would  be  to  “treat  the  cost  of \npayments  for  contraceptive  services  . . .  as  an  administrative  cost  that is  spread  across  the \nissuer’s entire risk pool, excluding plans established or maintained by eligible organizations.” 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39878.  \n129. There is no legal authority for forcing third parties to pay for services provided to \neligible organizations under the accommodation. \n130. Furthermore, under the Affordable Care Act, Defendants lack authority in the first \nplace  to  coerce  insurers  to  directly  purchase  contraceptive,  sterilization,  and  abortifacient \nservices for an eligible organization’s plan participants and beneficiaries.  \n131. Thus, the accommodation fails to protect objecting religious organizations for lack of \nstatutory authority. \n132. Currently, Belmont Abbey College is insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield of North \nCarolina. Because Belmont Abbey College would be required to identify and designate an \n22 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 24 of 48\ninsurer  willing  to  administer  the  contraceptive  and  abortifacient  services,  Belmont  Abbey \nCollege’s religious beliefs preclude it from complying with the accommodation. \n133. For all these reasons, the accommodation does nothing to relieve non-exempt religious \norganizations with insured plans—such as Belmont Abbey College—from being co-opted as the \ncentral cog in the government’s scheme to expand access to free contraceptive and abortifacient \nservices.  \n134. The Final Rule sets forth complex means through which a third party administrator may \nseek  to  recover  its  costs  incurred  in  making  payments  for  contraceptive  and  abortifacient \nservices.  \n135. The third party administrator must identify an issuer who participates in the federal \nexchanges  established  under  the  Affordable  Care  Act  and  who  would  be  willing  to  make \npayments on behalf of the third party administrator.  \n136. Cooperating issuers would then be authorized to obtain refunds from the user fees they \nhave paid to participate in the federal exchange as a means of being reimbursed for making \npayments for contraceptive and abortifacient services on behalf of the third party administrator.  \n137.  Issuers would be required to pay a portion of the refund back to the third party \nadministrator to compensate it for any administrative expenses it has incurred. \n138. These extreme machinations, ostensibly employed only to shift the cost of the Final \nMandate, are severely flawed.  \n139. There  is  no  way  to  ensure  that  the  cost  of  administering  the  contraceptive  and \nabortifacient services would not be passed on to religious organizations through the third party \nadministrator’s fees.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 25 of 48\n140. Moreover, taking the user fees intended for funding the federal exchanges and using \nthem to provide contraceptive and abortifacient services to employees not participating in the \nfederal exchanges would violate the statute authorizing the user fees. See 78 Fed. Reg. 15410, \n15412 (published March 11, 2013); 31 U.S.C. § 9701.  \n141. In sum, for both insured organizations like Belmont Abbey College and self-insured \norganizations, the accommodation is nothing more than a shell game that attempts to disguise the \nreligious organization’s role as the central cog in the government’s scheme for expanding access \nto contraceptive and abortifacient services. \n142. Despite  the  accommodation’s  convoluted  machinations,  a  religious  organization’s \ndecision to offer health insurance and its self-certification continue to serve as the sole triggers \nfor creating access to free contraceptive and abortifacient services.  \n143. Belmont Abbey College cannot participate in or facilitate the government’s scheme in \nthis manner without violating its religious convictions. \nBelmont Abbey College’s Health Care Plan and Its Religious Objections \n144. The  plan  year  for  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  employee  healthcare  plan  begins  on \nDecember 1 of each year. \n145. Belmont Abbey College’s employee health care plan is an insured plan issued by Blue \nCross Blue Shield of North Carolina. \n146. Thus, beginning on or about December 1, 2014, Belmont Abbey College faces the \nchoice  of  either  including  free  coverage  for  contraceptive  and  abortifacient  services  in  its \nemployee health plan or else forcing its insurer to provide the exact same services. \n147. Belmont Abbey College has no objection to including, and already does include, free \ncoverage for women’s preventive services such as mammograms. It also has no conscientious \n24 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 26 of 48\nobjection to providing access to drugs typically used for contraception when they are instead \nused for purely medical reasons unrelated to birth control, such as treating ovarian cysts. \n148. However, Belmont Abbey College’s religious convictions forbid it from including free \ncoverage for abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive services in any of its healthcare plans. \n149. Belmont  Abbey  College’s  religious  convictions  equally  forbid  it  from  hiring  or \ndesignating its insurer to provide free access to abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive \nservices. \n150. From Belmont Abbey College’s perspective, forcing its insurance issuer to provide free \naccess  to  abortifacient,  sterilization,  or  contraceptive  services  is  no  different  than  directly \nproviding that access. \n151. Belmont Abbey College’s religious convictions forbid it from participating in any way \nin the government’s scheme to promote and provide free access to abortifacient, sterilization, or \ncontraceptive services through Belmont Abbey College’s health care plans. \n152. Belmont Abbey College is not eligible for the religious employers exemption because it \nis not an organization “described in section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46626. \n153.  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  current  employee  health  insurance  plan  has  changed \nsignificantly after March 23, 2010 and has never included the statements regarding grandfathered \nstatus required under federal law. \n154. Belmont  Abbey’s  employee  healthcare  plan  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  a \n“grandfathered” plan. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(i); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i); 29 \nC.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i). \n25 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 27 of 48\n155. Because Belmont Abbey College is unable to comply with the Final Mandate because \nof its religious beliefs, and because it is unable to force its insurer to carry out the Final Mandate \nby submitting a self-certification, it faces crippling fines of $100 each day, for “each individual \nto whom such failure relates.” 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). \n156. Dropping  its  insurance  plans  would  unfairly  and  severely  burden  Belmont  Abbey \nCollege’s  employees,  and  would  place  Belmont  Abbey  College  at  a  severe  competitive \ndisadvantage in its efforts to recruit and retain employees. \n157. Belmont  Abbey  College  would  also  face  fines  of  $2000  per  year  for  each  of  its \nemployees for dropping its insurance plans. \n158. Although the government has recently announced that it will postpone implementing \nthe annual fine of $2000 per employee for organizations that drop their insurance altogether, the \npostponement is only for one year, until 2015. This postponement does not delay the crippling \ndaily fines under 26 U.S.C. § 4980D. \n159. Belmont Abbey College’s Catholic faith compels it to promote the spiritual and physical \nwell-being of its employees by providing them with generous health services. \n160. The Final Mandate forces Belmont Abbey College to violate its religious beliefs or \nincur substantial fines for either excluding objectionable coverage without forcing its insurance \nissuer to provide the same coverage, or terminating its employee health insurance coverage \naltogether. \n161. The  Final  Mandate  forces  Belmont  Abbey  College  to  deliberately  provide  health \ninsurance that would facilitate free access to abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive services \nregardless of the ability of insured persons to obtain these drugs and services from other sources. \n26 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 28 of 48\n162. The Final Mandate forces Belmont Abbey College to facilitate government-dictated \neducation  and  counseling  concerning  abortion,  sterilization,  and  contraceptive  use  that  are \nincompatible with its religious beliefs and teachings. \n163. Facilitating this government-dictated speech is incompatible and irreconcilable with the \nexpress speech and messages concerning the sanctity of life and sexuality that Belmont Abbey \nCollege seeks to convey. \nThe Lack of a Compelling Government Interest \n164. The government lacks any compelling interest in coercing Belmont Abbey College to \nfacilitate access to abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive services. \n165. The required abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive drugs, devices, and related \nservices are already widely available at non-prohibitive costs. \n166. There are multiple ways in which the government could provide access without co-\nopting religious employers and their insurance plans in violation of their religious beliefs. \n167. For example, it could pay for the objectionable services through its existing network of \nfamily planning services funded under Title X, through direct government payments, or through \ntax deductions, refunds, or credits. \n168. The government could also simply exempt all religious organizations, just as it has \nalready exempted nonprofit religious employers referred to in Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code. \n169. HHS  claims  that  its  “religious  employers”  exemption  does  not  undermine  its \ncompelling  interest  in  making  contraceptive  and  abortifacient  services  available for  free  to \nwomen because “houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people who are of \n27 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 29 of 48\nthe same faith and/or adhere to the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than \nother people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan.” \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39887. \n170. Belmont  Abbey  College’s  employees  commit  to  further  its  mission  of  being  a \ndistinctively  Catholic  and  Benedictine  institution,  including  its  mission  of  communicating \nCatholic beliefs concerning the sanctity of life and sexuality.  \n171. Because of Belmont Abbey College’s religious obligation under Ex Corde Ecclesiae to \nproclaim Catholic teaching regarding the sanctity of life and sexuality, many of the students and \nemployees that have chosen to join the Belmont Abbey College community are just as likely as \nemployees of exempt organizations to adhere to the same values, and thus are less likely than \nother people to use the objectionable drugs, devices, and services. \n172. In one form or another, the government also provides exemptions for grandfathered \nplans, 42 U.S.C. § 18011; 75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41731 (2010), small employers with fewer than \n50 employees, 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2)(A), and certain religious denominations, 26 U.S.C. \n§ 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (individual mandate does not apply to members of “recognized \nreligious  sect  or  division”  that  conscientiously  objects  to  acceptance  of  public  or  private \ninsurance funds); 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(d)(2)(b)(ii) (individual mandate does not apply to members \nof “health care sharing ministry” that meets certain criteria).  \n173. These broad exemptions further demonstrate that the government has no compelling \ninterest in refusing to include religious organizations like Belmont Abbey College within its \nreligious employers exemption. \n174. Employers  who  follow  HHS  guidelines  may  continue  to  use  grandfathered  plans \nindefinitely. \n28 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 30 of 48\n175. Indeed, HHS has predicted that a majority of large employers, employing more than 50 \nmillion Americans, will continue to use grandfathered plans through at least 2014, and that a \nthird of medium-sized employers with between 50 and 100 employees may do likewise. 75 Fed. \nReg. 34538 (published June 17, 2010).14  \n176. According to the United States census, more than 20 million individuals are employed \nby firms with fewer than 20 employees.15  \n177. It is reasonable to presume that millions more are employed by firms with between 20 \nand 50 employees.    \n178. The government’s recent decision to postpone the employer mandate—i.e., the annual \nfine of $2000 per employee for not offering any insurance—also demonstrates that there is no \ncompelling  interest  in  coercing  universal  compliance  with  the  Final  Mandate  concerning \ncontraceptive and abortifacient services, since employers can now simply drop their insurance \nwithout any penalty, at least for one additional year. \n179. These broad exemptions also demonstrate that the Final Mandate is not a generally \napplicable law entitled to judicial deference, but rather is constitutionally flawed.  \n180. The government’s willingness to exempt various secular organizations and postpone \nthe  employer  mandate,  while  adamantly  refusing  to  provide  anything  but  the  narrowest  of \nexemptions for religious organizations also shows that the Final Mandate is not neutral, but \n                                                 \n14  See  also  Centers  for  Medicare  &  Medicaid  Services,  Amendment  to  Regulation  on \n“Grandfathered”  Health  Plans  under  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  https://www.cms.gov/ \nCCIIO/Resources/Files/factsheet_grandfather_amendment.html  (noting  that  amendment  to \nregulations “will result in a small increase in the number of plans retaining their grandfathered \nstatus relative to the estimates made in the grandfathering regulation”) (last visited Nov. 19, \n2013) (Ex. F). \n15  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Statistics  About  Business  Size,  http://www.census.gov/econ/ \nsmallbus.html (last visited Nov. 19, 2013) (Ex. G). \n29 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 31 of 48\nrather discriminates against religious organizations because of their religious commitment to \npromoting the sanctity of life. \n181. Indeed, the Final Mandate was promulgated by government officials, and supported by \nnon-governmental  organizations,  who  strongly  oppose  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  religious \nteachings and beliefs regarding marriage and family. \n182. Defendant Sebelius, for example, has long been a staunch supporter of abortion rights \nand a vocal critic of religious teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception. \n183. On October 5, 2011, six days after the comment period for the original interim final \nrule ended, Defendant Sebelius gave a speech at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America. \nShe told the assembled crowd that “we are in a war.”16 \n184. She further criticized individuals and entities whose beliefs differed from those held by \nher and the others at the fundraiser, stating: “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce \nthe  number  of  abortions  would  champion  the  cause  of widely  available,  widely  affordable \ncontraceptive services? Not so much.” \n185. On July 16, 2013, Secretary Sebelius further compared opponents of the Affordable \nCare Act generally to people who opposed civil rights legislation in the 1960s, stating that \nupholding the Act requires the same action as was shown “in the fight against lynching and the \nfight for desegregation.”17  \n186. Consequently,  on  information  and  belief,  Belmont  Abbey  College  alleges  that  the \npurpose of the Final Mandate, including the restrictively narrow scope of the religious employers \n                                                 \n16 William McGurn, The Church of Kathleen Sebelius, Wall St. J., Dec. 13, 2011, available at \nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203518404577094631979925326  (Ex. \nH). \n17 See Kathleen Sebelius, Remarks at the 104th NAACP Annual Conference, July 16, 2013, \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/speeches/sp20130716.html (Ex.

Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n188. Belmont Abbey College’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately \nproviding health insurance that would facilitate access to contraception, sterilization, abortion, or \nrelated education and counseling. Belmont Abbey College’s compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise. \n189. The Final Mandate creates government-imposed coercive pressure on Belmont Abbey \nCollege to change or violate its religious beliefs. \n190. The Final Mandate chills the Belmont Abbey College’s religious exercise. \n191. The Final Mandate exposes Belmont Abbey College to substantial fines for its religious \nexercise. \n192. The  Final  Mandate  exposes  Belmont  Abbey  College  to  substantial  competitive \ndisadvantages, in that it will no longer be permitted to offer health insurance. \n193. The Final Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Belmont Abbey College’s religious \nexercise. \n194. The Final Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n195. The Final Mandate is not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest. \n196. The Final Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n31 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 33 of 48\n197. The  Final Mandate  and  Defendants’ threatened  enforcement  of  the  Final  Mandate \nviolate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  \n198. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nBurden \n \n199. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n200. Belmont Abbey College’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately \nproviding health insurance that would facilitate access to contraception, sterilization, abortion, or \nrelated education and counseling. Belmont Abbey College’s compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise. \n201. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Final Mandate is neutral. \n202. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Final Mandate is generally applicable. \n203. Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized exemptions to the \nFinal Mandate. \n204. The Final Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n205. The Final Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n206. The Final Mandate creates government-imposed coercive pressure on Belmont Abbey \nCollege to change or violate its religious beliefs. \n207. The Final Mandate chills Belmont Abbey College’s religious exercise. \n32 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 34 of 48\n208. The Final Mandate exposes Belmont Abbey College to substantial fines for its religious \nexercise. \n209. The  Final  Mandate  exposes  Belmont  Abbey  College  to  substantial  competitive \ndisadvantages, in that it will no longer be permitted to offer health insurance. \n210. The Final Mandate imposes a burden on Belmont Abbey College’s religious exercise. \n211. The Final Mandate is not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest. \n212. The  Final Mandate  and  Defendants’ threatened  enforcement  of  the  Final  Mandate \nviolate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n213. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nIntentional Discrimination \n \n214. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n215. Belmont Abbey College’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately \nproviding health insurance that would facilitate access to contraception, sterilization, abortion, or \nrelated education and counseling. Belmont Abbey College’s compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise. \n216. Despite being informed in detail of these beliefs beforehand, Defendants designed the \nFinal Mandate and the religious employer exemption to the Final Mandate to target religious \norganizations like Belmont Abbey College because of their religious beliefs. \n217. Defendants promulgated both the Final Mandate and its religious employer exemption \nin order to suppress the religious exercise of Belmont Abbey College and others. \n33 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 35 of 48\n218. The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate thus \nviolate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n219. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses \nDiscrimination Among Religions and Religious Institutions \n \n220. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n221. The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment mandate \nthe equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference. \n222. This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n223. The  Final  Mandate’s  narrow  exemption  for  “religious  employers”  but  not  others \ndiscriminates  among  religions  and  religious  institutions  on  the  basis  of  religious  views  or \nreligious status. \n224. The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate thus \nviolate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the First Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  \n225. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nSelective Burden (Larson v. Valente) \n \n226. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n34 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 36 of 48\n227. By design, defendants imposed the Final Mandate on some religious organizations but \nnot on others, resulting in a selective burden on Belmont Abbey College. \n228. The  Final Mandate  and  Defendants’ threatened  enforcement  of  the  Final  Mandate \ntherefore violate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the First Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n229. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \n230. The Final Mandate vests HRSA with unbridled discretion in deciding whether to allow \nexemptions to some, all, or no organizations meeting the definition of “religious employers.” \nCOUNT VI \n \nInterference in Matters of Internal Religious Governance \nFree Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause \n \n231. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n232. The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause protect the freedom of religious \norganizations  to  decide  for  themselves,  free  from  state  interference,  matters  of  internal \ngovernance as well as those of faith and doctrine. \n233. Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious organization’s \ninternal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, leadership, or doctrine. \n234. Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious organization’s \ninternal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the organization itself. \n235. Belmont Abbey College has made an internal decision, dictated by its Christian faith, \nthat any health plans it makes available to its employees may not subsidize, provide, or facilitate \naccess to abortifacient, sterilization, or contraceptive drugs, devices, or related services. \n35 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 37 of 48\n236. The  Final  Mandate  interferes  with  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  internal  decisions \nconcerning its structure and mission by requiring it to subsidize, provide, and facilitate practices \nthat directly conflict with its Christian beliefs \n237. The Final Mandate’s interference with Belmont Abbey College’s internal decisions \naffects its faith and mission by requiring it to subsidize, provide, and facilitate practices that \ndirectly conflict with its religious beliefs. \n238. Because the Final Mandate interferes with Belmont Abbey College’s internal decision \nmaking in a manner that affects its faith and mission, it violates the Establishment Clause and \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \nAbsent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey College has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT VII \nReligious Discrimination \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nEstablishment Clause and Due Process \n \n239.  Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n240. By design, defendants imposed the Final Mandate on some religious organizations but \nnot on others, resulting in discrimination among religious objectors. \n241. Religious liberty is a fundamental right. \n242. The “religious employer” exemption protects many religious objectors, but not Belmont \nAbbey College. \n243. The “accommodation” provides no meaningful protection for Belmont Abbey College. \n244. The  Final Mandate  and  Defendants’ threatened  enforcement  of  the  Final  Mandate \ntherefore violate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the Establishment Clause of \n36 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 38 of 48\nthe First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n245. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process and Equal Protection \n \n246. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n247. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment mandates the equal treatment of all \nreligious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference. \n248. This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n249. The  Final  Mandate’s  narrow  exemption  for  “religious  employers”  but  not  others \ndiscriminates among religions on the basis of religious views or religious status. \n250. The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate thus \nviolate Belmont Abbey College’s rights secured to it by the Fifth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  \n251. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IX \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech and Compelled Silence \n \n252. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n253. Belmont Abbey College teaches that contraception, sterilization, and abortion violate \nits religious beliefs.  \n37 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 39 of 48\n254. The Final Mandate would compel Belmont Abbey College to subsidize activities that \nBelmont Abbey College teaches are violations of Belmont Abbey College’s religious beliefs. \n255. The Final Mandate would compel Belmont Abbey College to provide education and \ncounseling related to contraception, sterilization, and abortion. \n256. Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  right  to  be  free  from \ncompelled speech as secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n257. If Belmont Abbey College chose to use a third-party administrator, the Final Mandate \nalso prevents Belmont Abbey College from speaking to that administrator about its religious \nbeliefs and preference that the administrator not provide the services at issue. \n258. The Final Mandate’s speech restrictions are not narrowly tailored to a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n259. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed.    \nCOUNT X \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nExpressive Association \n \n260. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n261. Belmont Abbey College teaches that contraception, sterilization, and abortion violate \nits religious beliefs.  \n262. The Final Mandate would compel Belmont Abbey College to facilitate activities that \nBelmont Abbey College teaches are violations of Belmont Abbey College’s religious beliefs. \n38 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 40 of 48\n263. The  Final  Mandate  would  compel  Belmont  Abbey  College  to  facilitate  access  to \ngovernment-dictated  education  and  counseling  related  to  contraception,  sterilization,  and \nabortion. \n264. Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  right  of  expressive \nassociation as secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n265. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed.   \nCOUNT XI \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause and Freedom of Speech \nUnbridled Discretion \n \n266. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n267. By stating that HRSA “may” grant an exemption to certain religious groups, the Final \nMandate vests HRSA with unbridled discretion over which organizations can have its First \nAmendment interests accommodated. \n268. Defendants have exercised unbridled discretion in a discriminatory manner by granting \nan exemption via footnote in a website for a narrowly defined group of “religious employers” but \nnot for other religious organizations like Belmont Abbey College. \n269. Defendants have further exercised unbridled discretion by indiscriminately waiving \nenforcement of some provisions of the Affordable Care Act while refusing to waive enforcement \nof the Final Mandate, despite its conflict with the free exercise of religion. \n270. Defendants’  actions  therefore  violate  Belmont  Abbey  College’s  right  not  to  be \nsubjected to a system of unbridled discretion when engaging in speech or when engaging in \nreligious exercise, as secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.    \n39 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 41 of 48\n271. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XII \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nLack of Good Cause and Improper Delegation \n \n272. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n273. The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to HRSA, an agency within Defendant \nHHS, the authority to establish guidelines concerning the “preventive care” that a group health \nplan and health insurance issuer must provide. \n274. Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal notice-\nand-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines that group \nhealth plans and insurers must cover. Proposed regulations were required to be published in the \nFederal Register and interested persons were required to be given an opportunity to participate in \nthe rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. \n275. Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law. Defendants, instead, wholly \ndelegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive care guidelines to a non-governmental \nentity, the IOM.  \n276. The IOM did not permit or provide for the broad public comment otherwise required \nunder the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend. The dissent to the IOM \nreport noted both that the IOM conducted its review in an unacceptably short time frame, and \nthat the review process lacked transparency. \n277. Within two weeks of the IOM issuing its guidelines, Defendant HHS issued a press \nrelease announcing that the IOM’s guidelines were required under the Affordable Care Act. \n40 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 42 of 48\n278. Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n279. Defendants’ stated reasons that public comments were unnecessary, impractical, and \nopposed to the public interest are false and insufficient, and do not constitute “good cause.”  \n280. Without proper notice and opportunity for public comment, Defendants were unable to \ntake  into  account  the  full  implications  of  the  regulations  by  completing  a  meaningful \n“consideration of the relevant matter presented.”  \n281. Defendants did not consider or respond to the voluminous comments they received in \nopposition to the interim final rule or the NPRM.  \n282. Therefore, Defendants have taken agency action not in observance with procedures \nrequired  by  law,  and  Belmont  Abbey  College  is  entitled  to  relief  pursuant  to  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D). \n283. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XIII \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Action \n \n284. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n285. In promulgating the Final Mandate, Defendants failed to consider the constitutional and \nstatutory  implications  of  the  Final  Mandate  on  Belmont  Abbey  College  and  similar \norganizations. \n286. Defendants’ explanation for its decision not to exempt Belmont Abbey College and \nsimilar religious organizations from the Final Mandate runs counter to the evidence submitted by \nreligious organizations during the comment period.  \n41 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 43 of 48\n287. Defendant Secretary Sebelius, in remarks made at Harvard University on April 8, 2013, \nessentially  conceded  that  Defendants  completely  disregarded  the  religious  liberty  concerns \nsubmitted by thousands of religious organizations and individuals. \n288. Thus, Defendants’ issuance of the interim final rule was arbitrary and capricious within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because the rules fail to consider the full extent of their \nimplications and they do not take into consideration the evidence against them. \n289. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XIV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Without Statutory Authority \n \n290.  Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n291. Defendant’s authority to enact regulations under the Affordable Care Act is limited to \nthe authority expressly granted them by Congress. \n292. Defendants  lack  statutory  authority  to  coerce  insurance  issuers  and  third  party \nadministrators to pay for contraceptive and abortifacient services for individuals with whom they \nhave no contractual or fiduciary relationship. \n293. Defendants  lack  statutory  authority  to  prevent  insurance  issuers  and  third  party \nadministrators from passing on the costs of providing contraceptive and abortifacient services via \nhigher premiums or other charges that are not “cost sharing.” \n294. Defendants lack statutory authority to allow user fees from the federal exchanges to be \nused to purchase contraceptive and abortifacient services for employees not participating in the \nexchanges.  \n42 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 44 of 48\n295. Because the Final Mandate’s “accommodation” for non-exempt, nonprofit religious \norganizations lacks legal authority, it is arbitrary and capricious and provides no legitimate \nprotection of  objecting organization’s First Amendment rights.  \n296. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law \nWeldon Amendment \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n297. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n298. The Final Mandate is contrary to the provisions of the Weldon Amendment of the \nConsolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009, Pub. L. \n110-117, 123 Stat. 3034 (Dec. 16, 2009).18 \n299. The Weldon Amendment provides that “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act \n[making appropriations for Defendants Department of Labor and Health and Human Services] \nmay be  made available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or \ngovernment subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the \nbasis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for \nabortions.” \n                                                 \n18  Available  at  http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/ConscienceProtect/publaw \n111_117_123_stat_3034.pdf (Ex. J). \n43 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 45 of 48\n300. The Final Mandate requires issuers, including Belmont Abbey College, to deliberately \nprovide health insurance that facilitates access to all Federal Drug Administration-approved \ncontraceptives. \n301. Some FDA-approved contraceptives cause abortions. \n302. As set forth above, the Final Mandate violates RFRA and the First Amendment. \n303. Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), the Final Mandate is contrary to existing law, and is in \nviolation of the APA.  \n304. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XVI \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law \nAffordable Care Act \n \n305. Belmont Abbey College incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n306. The Final Mandate is contrary to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  \n307. Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title”—i.e., title I of \nthe Act, which includes the provision dealing with “preventive services”—“shall be construed to \nrequire a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its \nessential health benefits for any plan year.” \n308. Section 1303 further states that it is “the issuer” of a plan that “shall determine whether \nor not the plan provides coverage” of abortion services.  \n309. Under the Affordable Care Act, Defendants do not have the authority to decide whether \na plan covers abortion; only the issuer does. \n44 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01831-CRC   Document 1   Filed 11/20/13   Page 46 of 48\n310. The Final Mandate requires group health plans, including Belmont Abbey College’s, to \nprovide coverage of all Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptives. \n311. Some FDA-approved contraceptives cause abortions. \n312. Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), the Final Mandate is contrary to existing law, and is in \nviolation of the APA. \n313. Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Belmont Abbey \nCollege has been and will continue to be harmed. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Belmont Abbey College requests that the Court:  \na.   Declare that the Final Mandate and Defendants’ enforcement of the Final Mandate \nagainst Belmont Abbey College violate the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution; \nb.
