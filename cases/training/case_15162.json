    "summary": "<p>On April 30, 2013, a group of California public school teachers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983. Represented by private counsel and the Center for Individual Rights, the plaintiffs asked the district court to strike down California's agency-shop law. The law requires public employees to pay some union fees as a condition of public employment; the plaintiffs argued that this unconstitutionally abridged their freedom of speech and association. They sought an injunction barring the union from requiring nonunion employees to pay money to support the union in any way. </p><p>Under California law, a union is allowed to become the exclusive bargaining representative for public school employees in a bargaining unit such as a public school district by submitting proof that a majority of employees in the unit wish to be represented by the union. Cal. Govโt. Code ยง 3544(a). Once a union becomes the exclusive bargaining representative, it may establish an โagency-shopโ arrangement with that district, whereby all employees โshall, as a condition of continued employment, be required either to join the recognized employee organization or pay the fair share service fee.โ Id. ยง 3546(a).  The fee is supposed to cover only โchargeableโ union expenditures--those germane to collective bargaining, not expenditures on other matters. </p><p>Plaintiffs conceded that their challenge was entirely foreclosed by <i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), and <i>Mitchell v. Los Angeles Unified School District</i>, 963 F.2d 258 (9th Cir. 1992). In <i>Abood</i>, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of compelling employees to pay their fair share of the costs of collective bargaining. In <i>Mitchell</i>, the 9th Circuit further held that the First Amendment did not require an โopt inโ procedure, but allowed California's \"opt out\" approach. </p><p>Plaintiffs wanted to get to the Supreme Court, where they could ask the Court to overrule <i>Abood</i>.  So they asked the District Court in this case to grant judgment on the pleadings to the defendants. The court did so, in a short opinion by Judge Josephine Staton, on December 5, 2013.  2013 WL 9825479.  Plaintiffs then appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and on appeal, similarly sought summary affirmance to tee the issue up for the Supreme Court.  In a one-paragraph order issued (per curiam, by Judges Canby, Clifton, and Owens) on November 18, 2014, the 9th Circuit, did so.  2014 WL 10076847.  </p><p>Plaintiffs then sought certiorari review in the Supreme Court, which was granted on June 30, 2015.  135 S.Ct. 2933.  Arguments took place January 11, 2016; the case was decided on March 29, 2016. 136 S.Ct. 1083. In a one-sentence per curiam opinion saying โThe judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.โ The plaintiffs asked for a rehearing, which was denied. The case is now closed.</p>",

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \n7  individual rights of free speech and free association, including the right to withhold \n8  support from political causes and activities that conflict with oneโs beliefs.  โWhen a \n9  State establishes an โagency shopโ that exacts compulsory union fees as a condition \n10  of public employment, the dissenting employee is forced to support financially an \n11  organization with whose principles and demands he may disagree.  Because a \n12  public-sector union takes many positions during collective bargaining that have \n13  powerful political and civic consequences, the compulsory fees constitute a form of \n14  compelled speech and association that imposes a significant impingement on First \n15  Amendment rights.โ  Knox v. Serv. Emps. Intโl Union, Local 1000, 132 S. Ct. 2277, \n16  2289 (2012) (citations and alterations omitted).   \n17  2.  The State of California (the โStateโ) and its public school districts, in \n18  cooperation with the California Teachers Association (โCTAโ) and the other named \n19  Defendants, maintain an โagency shopโ arrangement that injures public school \n20  teachers, including Plaintiffs, by forcing them to make financial contributions to \n21  teachersโ unions as a condition of public employment.  This agency-shop \n22  arrangement is established and maintained under color of State law, the California \n23  Educational Employment Relations Act (โEERAโ), Cal. Govโt Code ยง 3540 et seq.  \n24  Each year, the unions estimate a breakdown of expenditures that will be \n25  โchargeableโ (i.e., germane to collective bargaining) and โnon-chargeableโ (i.e., \n26  political or ideological and not germane to collective bargaining).  Teachers are \n27  required to contribute to the unionโs โchargeableโ expenditures.  Teachers who wish \n28  to avoid contributing to a unionโs โnon-chargeableโ expenditures are annually forced \n   \n- 1 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 4 of 211   Page ID #:23\n1  to affirmatively express that they do not wish to contribute.  Each year they must \n2  send the union a new notice indicating their objection.  \n3  3.  This โopt outโ process is unnecessarily burdensome and time-\n4  consuming and is susceptible to resistance and pressure from the unions and their \n5  members.   \n6  4.  Even if a teacher successfully completes the โopt outโ process, he or \n7  she is still forced to pay the โchargeableโ portion of fees to support the unionโs \n8  collective-bargaining activities.  Any teacher who objects to the unionโs \n9  classification of certain expenditures as โchargeableโ must bear the additional \n10  burden and expense of filing a legal challenge.   \n11  5.  Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement violates Plaintiffsโ First \n12  Amendment rights in two distinct ways.  First, the agency-shop arrangement violates \n13  their rights of free speech and association by forcing them to contribute to so-called \n14  โchargeableโ union expenditures germane to collective bargaining, even though \n15  those contributions provide economic support to โnon-chargeableโ union activities \n16  and even though many of the โchargeableโ expenditures and collective-bargaining \n17  activities are contrary to Plaintiffsโ personal interests and political beliefs.  Second, \n18  the agency-shop arrangement violates Plaintiffsโ rights of free speech and \n19  association by forcing them to undergo an โopt outโ process each year to avoid \n20  contributing to political and ideological expenditures that the unions concede are not \n21  germane to collective bargaining. \n22  6.  These severe infringements on Plaintiffsโ rights to free speech and \n23  association cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny.  Laws mandating \n24  compulsory speech and association must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \n25  government interest.  Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement cannot meet that \n26  standard.  Requiring forced contributions of non-members for collective bargaining-\n27  efforts in the public sector serves no compelling state interest and is not narrowly \n28  tailored.  Requiring non-members to contribute to โnon-chargeableโ union \n   \n - 2 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 5 of 211   Page ID #:24\n1  expenditures unless they go through an annual opt-out process also serves no \n2  compelling state interest and is not narrowly tailored. \n3  7.  It is clear that the Californiaโs โagency shopโ does not serve the \n4  interests of all public school teachers.  In the course of collective bargaining, unions \n5  frequently take politically controversial positions that contradict the deeply held \n6  beliefs of some teachers, who do not believe the policies advocated by unions to be \n7  in their best interest, or in the best interest of society at large.  For example, unions \n8  consistently โbargainโ for provisions requiring increased State spending, and against \n9  important educational reforms which some teachers believe would benefit teachers, \n10  students, and taxpayers.  Even in purely material terms, โseniorityโ protections and \n11  other employment protections advocated by unions benefit some teachers at the \n12  expense of other teachers who would fare better under an alternative system.  \n13  8.  Recognizing that compulsory agency fees violate the First Amendment \n14  will not undermine the unionsโ authority or entitlement to engage in collective \n15  bargaining.  The unions will remain the exclusive collective-bargaining agents in \n16  each school district as long as they retain the support of a majority of teachers in \n17  those districts.  Public school teachers will, therefore, remain fully entitled to join \n18  together and collectively bargain through the unions for any and all desired labor \n19  protections. \n20  9.  Given the severe and ongoing infringement of Plaintiffsโ rights to free \n21  speech and free association, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court declare \n22  that Californiaโs practice of forcing non-union members to contribute funds to \n23  unions, including funds to support their collective-bargaining activities, violates the \n24  First Amendment, and enjoin Defendants from enforcing this unconstitutional \n25  arrangement.  \n26  10.  Plaintiffs additionally request that this Court declare that the \n27  Defendantsโ practice of requiring an annual affirmative โopt outโ to avoid \n28 \n   \n - 3 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 6 of 211   Page ID #:25\n1  contributing to โnon-chargeableโ union expenditures violates the First Amendment, \n2  and enjoin Defendants from imposing this unconstitutional burden. \n3  PARTIES \n4  11.  Plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs has been a public school teacher in the \n5  Savanna School District for 25 years.  She resigned her union membership in 2012 \n6  and opted out of paying the non-chargeable portion of the agency fees.  But for \n7  Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Ms. Friedrichs would not pay fees to or \n8  otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, and she objects to the Stateโs forced \n9  subsidization policy.  She objects to many of the unionsโ public policy positions, \n10  including positions taken in collective bargaining. \n11  12.  Plaintiff Scott Wilford has been a public school teacher in California \n12  for 20 years.  He has been a teacher in the Saddleback Valley School District for 14 \n13  years.

But for Californiaโs \n15  โagency shopโ arrangement, Mr. Wilford would not pay fees to or otherwise \n16  subsidize the teachersโ union, and he objects to the Stateโs forced subsidization \n17  policy.  He objects to many of the unionsโ public policy positions, including \n18  positions taken in collective bargaining. \n19  13.  Plaintiff Jelena Figueroa has been a public school teacher in the Orange \n20  Unified School District for ten years.

He objects to many of the unionsโ public policy \n4  positions, including positions taken in collective bargaining. \n5  15.  Plaintiff Kevin Roughton has been a public school teacher in the Jurupa \n6  Unified School District for eleven years.  He resigned his union membership in \n7  2008.  Every year since, he has opted out of paying the non-chargeable portion of \n8  the agency fees.  But for Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Mr. Roughton \n9  would not pay fees to or otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, and he objects to \n10  the Stateโs forced subsidization policy.  He objects to many of the unionsโ public \n11  policy positions, including positions taken in collective bargaining. \n12  16.  Plaintiff Peggy Searcy has been a public school teacher in the Santa \n13  Ana Unified School District for 23 years.  She resigned her union membership in or \n14  about 2010.  Every year since, she has opted out of paying the non-chargeable \n15  portion of the agency fees.  But for Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Ms. \n16  Searcy would not pay fees to or otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, and she \n17  objects to the Stateโs forced subsidization policy.  She objects to many of the \n18  unionsโ public policy positions, including positions taken in collective bargaining. \n19  17.  Plaintiff Jose Manso began teaching in 1979.  He left the profession for \n20  a 23-year period and returned to teaching fulltime in the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified \n21  School District in 2002.  He resigned his union membership in 2010.  Every year \n22  since, he has opted out of paying the non-chargeable portion of the agency fees.  But \n23  for Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Mr. Manso would not pay fees to or \n24  otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, and he objects to the Stateโs forced \n25  subsidization policy.  He objects to many of the unionsโ public policy positions, \n26  including positions taken in collective bargaining. \n27  18.  Plaintiff Harlan Elrich has been a public school teacher for over 26 \n28  years and has been a public school teacher in California for over 20 years.  He has \n   \n - 5 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 8 of 211   Page ID #:27\n1  been a teacher in the Sanger Unified School District for 8 years.  He resigned his \n2  union membership in 2012 and opted out of paying the non-chargeable portion of \n3  the agency fees.  But for Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Mr. Elrich would \n4  not pay fees to or otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, and he objects to the \n5  Stateโs forced subsidization policy.  He objects to many of the unionsโ public policy \n6  positions, including positions taken in collective bargaining.  \n7  19.  Plaintiff Karen Cuen has been a public school teacher in California for \n8  25 years.  She has been a teacher in the Chino Valley Unified School District for 20 \n9  years.  She resigned her union membership in 1997.  Every year since, she has opted \n10  out of paying the non-chargeable portion of the agency fees.  But for Californiaโs \n11  โagency shopโ arrangement, Ms. Cuen would not pay fees to or otherwise subsidize \n12  the teachersโ union, and she objects to the Stateโs forced subsidization policy.  She \n13  objects to many of the unionsโ public policy positions, including positions taken in \n14  collective bargaining. \n15  20.  Plaintiff Irene Zavala has been a public school teacher in California for \n16  13 years.  She began teaching in San Luis Obispo County in 2012.  She resigned her \n17  union membership in 2001.  Because of her religious principles, Mrs. Zavala is a \n18  religious objector under Cal. Govโt Code ยง 3546.3 (providing that โany employee \n19  who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include \n20  objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be \n21  required to join, maintain membership in, or financially support any employee \n22  organization as a condition of employment; except that such employee may be \n23  required, in lieu of a service fee, to pay sums equal to such service fee either to a \n24  nonreligious, nonlabor organization, charitable fund . . . chosen by such employee \n25  from a list of at least three such funds, designated in the organizational security \n26  arrangementโ).  To qualify as a religious objector under her unionโs collective-\n27  bargaining agreement and California law, id., Mrs. Zavala had to send a letter \n28  confirming her religious objections to making contributions to the union.  She then \n   \n - 6 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 9 of 211   Page ID #:28\n1  had to engage in protracted e-mail correspondence with union and district officials \n2  to ensure that her objections were processed.  In accordance with State law, once \n3  Mrs. Zavalaโs objection was properly processed, she was required to donate the full \n4  amount of the agency feeโnot merely the chargeable portionโto one of three State-\n5  approved charities specified in the collective-bargaining agreement.  See San Luis \n6  Obispo County Collective Bargaining Agreement, Art. 12.4.2 (attached as Ex. A).  \n7  But for Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement, Mrs. Zavala would not pay fees to \n8  or otherwise subsidize the teachersโ union, would decide for herself how much to \n9  donate in charitable contributions every year, and would not have her charitable \n10  contributions constrained by a collective-bargaining agreement.  She objects to the \n11  Stateโs agency-shop law, and to many of the unionsโ public policy positions, \n12  including positions taken in collective bargaining.  \n13  21.  Plaintiff CEAI is a non-profit religious organization that is the only \n14  professional association specifically serving Christians working in public schools.  \n15  Founded and incorporated in the state of California, CEAIโs membership consists of \n16  teachers, administrators, and para-professionals, and many other public and private \n17  school employees.  In addition, CEAI offers associate membership to parents, \n18  pastors, school-board members, youth leaders, and others concerned or interested in \n19  the education of the nationโs children.  CEAI has approximately 600 members in the \n20  State of California, most of whom are subject to the unconstitutional arrangements \n21  outlined herein.  Some of the individual Plaintiffs hereโKevin Roughton, Irene \n22  Zavala, Peggy Searcy, Jose Manso, Rebecca Friedrichs, and Harlan Elrichโare \n23  CEAI members.  CEAI and its members object on policy grounds to the positions \n24  taken by teachersโ unions in the collective bargaining process and outside of that \n25  process.  The interests that CEAI seeks to protect in this lawsuit are germane to the \n26  organizationโs purpose, and neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested \n27  require the participation in this lawsuit of CEAIโs individual members.  In addition, \n28  Defendantsโ conduct pursuant to the Stateโs agency-shop laws has the effect of \n   \n - 7 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 10 of 211   Page ID #:29\n1  creating a drain on CEAIโs resources.  There is a direct conflict between CEAIโs \n2  mission and the challenged agency-shop arrangements, and CEAI engages in \n3  counseling, referral, advocacy, and educational services relating to Californiaโs \n4  agency-shop arrangements, independently of this litigation. \n5  22.

This is an action under the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \n9  ยง 1983, to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges and \n10  immunities secured to Plaintiffs by the Constitution of the United States, particularly \n11  the First and Fourteenth Amendments \n12  46.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 \n13  U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a)(3)-(4).  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n14  ยงยง 2201 and 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57. \n15  47.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). \n16  48.  An actual controversy currently exists between the parties concerning \n17  the constitutionality of Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement.  That controversy is \n18  justiciable in character, and relief is necessary to preserve Plaintiffsโ rights and \n19  prevent future harm to Plaintiffs. \n20  49.  Californiaโs โagency shopโ arrangement imposes a cognizable injury on \n21  Plaintiffs by forcing them or their members to contribute money in support of union \n22  activities, and by forcing them to bear a substantial burden in order to โopt outโ of \n23  supporting union activities that the unions themselves classify as political and \n24  unrelated to collective bargaining. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n25 \nI.  Californiaโs โAgency Shopโ Law for Public-School Teachers \n26 \n50.  Under California law, a union may become the exclusive bargaining \n27 \nrepresentative for โpublic school employeesโ in a bargaining unit (usually a public \n28 \n   \n - 11 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 14 of 211   Page ID #:33\n1  school district) by submitting adequate proof that a majority of such employees in \n2  the unit wish to be represented exclusively by the union.  Cal. Govโt Code ยงยง 3544, \n3  3544.1.  โPublic school employeeโ for these purposes is statutorily defined as โa \n4  person employed by a public school employer except persons elected by popular \n5  vote, persons appointed by the Governor of this state, management employees, and \n6  confidential employees [who facilitate employee relations on behalf of \n7  management].โ  Id. ยง 3540.1(j).  When a union is designated as the exclusive \n8  representative, all the โpublic school employeesโ in that district are represented \n9  exclusively by the union for purposes of bargaining with the district.  Id. \n10  ยง 3543.1(a).  \n11  51.  California law defines the โterms and conditions of employment,โ \n12  concerning which the unions may collectively bargain, to include a wide range of \n13  issues at the heart of education policy.  Id. ยง 3543.2(a).  These topics of collective \n14  bargaining include wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of \n15  employment, such as โhealth and welfare benefits,โ โleave,โ โtransfer and \n16  reassignment policies,โ โsafety conditions of employment,โ โclass size,โ and \n17  โprocedures to be used for the evaluation of employees.โ  Id.  \n18  52.  Under State law, a union that has been recognized as the exclusive \n19  bargaining representative for a school district can enter into an agency-shop \n20  arrangement (also known as an โorganizational security agreementโ) with that \n21  district.  While teachers in the district are not required to become members of the \n22  union, they are required to pay fees to the union as a condition of their employment.  \n23  Id. ยง 3546(a).  State law authorizes the union to collect these โagency feesโ from all \n24  teachers in the district to fund the unionโs operations and expenditures.  Id.  Under \n25  California law, the category of expenses covered by agency fees โmay include, but \n26  shall not necessarily be limited to, the cost of lobbying activities designed to foster \n27  collective bargaining negotiations and contract administration, or to secure for the \n28  represented employees advantages in wages, hours, and other conditions of \n   \n - 12 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 15 of 211   Page ID #:34\n1  employment in addition to those secured through meeting and negotiating with the \n2  employer.โ  Id. ยง 3546(b).  Under the statute, the full amount of the โagency feeโ \n3  charged to non-members is determined by the union and โshall not exceed the dues \n4  that are payable by membersโ of the union.  Id. ยง 3546(a).  In practice, the amount \n5  of agency fees is typically equivalent to the amount of union dues. \n6  53.  If a teacher chooses to be a member of the union that is the exclusive \n7  representative in his or her district, the school district collects the full amount of \n8  union dues from that teacher and forwards them to the union.  Id. ยง 3543.1(d).  See \n9  also Cal. Educ. Code ยงยง 45060, 45061, 45061.5, 45168.  Non-union teachers are \n10  required to pay the above-described โagency feesโ to the union.  Each year, the \n11  union must send out a โHudsonโ notice indicating the percentage of the agency fees \n12  that will be โnon-chargeable,โ i.e., โnot devoted to the cost of negotiations, contract \n13  administration, and other activities of the employee organization that are germane to \n14  its function as the exclusive bargaining representative.โ  Cal. Govโt Code ยง 3546(a).  \n15  If a teacher who is not a member of the union affirmatively responds to the notice by \n16  indicating he or she would like to โopt outโ of paying the โnon-chargeableโ portion \n17  of the fee, he or she is entitled to a rebate or fee reduction for that year.  Id.; see also \n18  Regs. of Cal. Pub. Empโt Relations Bd. ยง 32992.  Absent such an affirmative โopt \n19  out,โ the non-member pays the full amount of the fee.   \n20  54.  Under State law, each school district may deduct agency fees from \n21  teachersโ paychecks and pay the fees to the union recognized for that district.  Cal. \n22  Govโt Code ยง 3546(a).  Alternatively, โany employee may pay service fees directly \n23  to the [union] in lieu of having such service fees deducted from the salary or wage \n24  order.โ  Cal. Educ. Code ยง 45061.  The amount of the total agency fee is determined \n25  by the union based on an estimate of its expenditures in the coming year.  The \n26  โchargeableโ and โnon-chargeableโ portions of the fee are calculated by the union \n27  based on an audited financial report for a recent year of the unionโs expenditures.  \n28  The union is required to include the audited financial report along with the \n   \n - 13 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 16 of 211   Page ID #:35\n1  breakdown of โchargeableโ and โnon-chargeableโ expenditures in the annual \n2  โHudsonโ notice sent out to teachers.

An agency fee payer who disagrees with the unionโs determination of \n5  the chargeable portion of the agency fee may file a challenge with the union after \n6  receiving the โHudsonโ notice.  Upon receipt of an agency fee challenge, the union \n7  must request a prompt hearing regarding the agency-fee breakdown before an \n8  impartial decisionmaker selected by either the American Arbitration Association or \n9  the California State Mediation Service.  Id. ยง 32994. \n10  II.  The โAgency Shopโ Arrangements in Californiaโs Public School \n11  Districts \n12  56.  Under color of state law, Cal. Govโt Code ยง 3540 et seq., Defendant \n13  local unions have been designated the exclusive bargaining agents for the school \n14  districts in which Plaintiffs are employed as teachers. \n15  57.  Under color of State law, id., Defendant local unions have entered into \n16  agency-shop agreements with the school districts where Plaintiffs are employed as \n17  teachers.  These agreements include provisions requiring that all teachers in these \n18  districts either join the unions, or else pay agency fees to the unions.  The \n19  agreements also provide that teachers must contribute to โnon-chargeableโ union \n20  expenditures unless they go through an opt-out process. \n21  58.  For each school district in which Plaintiffs are employed, the total \n22  agency-fee amount is determined by the local union that is recognized as the \n23  exclusive bargaining representative for that district, often in collaboration with CTA.  \n24  After the local union or CTA informs the school district of the annual agency-fee \n25  amount, the school district automatically deducts that amount in pro rata shares from \n26  the teacherโs regular paychecks (or, in some cases, the โchargeableโ portions of the \n27  fee for teachers who โopted outโ of โnon-chargeableโ fees) unless the teacher \n28  informs the district that he or she will pay the union directly.  The school district \n   \n - 14 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 17 of 211   Page ID #:36\n1  sends the deducted amounts directly to the local union, which then distributes part of \n2  the fees to CTA and NEA. \n3  59.  For each school district in which Plaintiffs are employed, the local \n4  unionโs agency fee includes โaffiliate feesโ for both CTA and NEA, which are the \n5  state and national affiliates of the local union.  The amount of the affiliate fees are \n6  uniform in every school district because they are determined on a statewide and \n7  nationwide basis by CTA and NEA, respectively. \n8  60.  For each school district in which Plaintiffs are employed, CTA and \n9  NEA โaffiliate feesโ are treated as partially โchargeable.โ  The โchargeableโ portion \n10  of the โaffiliate feesโ is based on the โchargeableโ portion of all statewide and \n11  nationwide expenditures by CTA and NEA.  Thus, the portions of CTA and NEA \n12  โaffiliate feesโ deemed โchargeableโ to teachers in local school districts are not \n13  designed to correspond to actual collective-bargaining expenditures made by CTA \n14  and NEA within those districts.  Rather, they are based on the overall breakdown of \n15  CTA and NEA โchargeableโ expenditures in California and the United States, \n16  respectively. \n17  61.  For each school district in which plaintiffs are employed, the \n18  โchargeableโ and โnon-chargeableโ portions of the agency fees are calculated based \n19  on an audit of the union expenditures in a recent year.  The auditors confirm that the \n20  union expenditures were made as indicated, but do not confirm that the union has \n21  properly classified the expenditures as โchargeableโ or โnon-chargeable.โ  \n22  62.  Teachers who are not union members receive an annual โHudsonโ \n23  notice each fall, giving them a breakdown of the โchargeableโ and โnon-chargeableโ \n24  portion of the agency fee.  Upon receiving this notice, teachers who are not union \n25  members have the option of undergoing the โopt outโ process, which requires them \n26  to object to the โnon-chargeableโ portion of the agency fee within approximately six \n27  weeks.  If a teacher succeeds in making a timely objection, the union either refrains \n28  from collecting the non-chargeable portion of the agency fee or sends a โrebateโ \n   \n - 15 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 18 of 211   Page ID #:37\n1  check to the teacher equal to the non-chargeable portion of the annual agency fee.  \n2  Teachers who receive the โHudsonโ notice also have the option to file a legal \n3  challenge to the unionโs calculation of the โchargeableโ and โnon-chargeableโ \n4  portions of the agency fee.  \n63.  Annual dues (or agency fees for non-members) typically consume \n5 \nroughly two percent of a new teacherโs salary, and sometimes increase regardless of \n6 \nwhether there is an increase in teacher pay.  The total amount of annual dues \n7 \ngenerally exceeds $1,000 per teacher, while the amount of the refund received by \n8 \nnonmembers who successfully opt out of the non-chargeable portion of their agency \n9 \nfees is generally around $350 to $400. \n10 \n64.  In order to participate in this โopt outโ process, the teacher cannot be a \n11 \nmember of the union.  This means that teachers who โopt outโ must forgo the ability \n12 \nto obtain direct benefits through the union, some of which benefits are typically (and \n13 \nwould likely otherwise be) obtainable through oneโs employer.  For example, \n14 \nteachers who โopt outโ are unable to obtain disability insurance as part of their \n15 \nemployment package.  See, e.g., CTA, Member Benefits, \n16 \nhttp://archive.cta.org/MemberBenefits/Disability.html (โMost school districts do not \n17 \nprovide disability insurance coverage for their employees.โ); id. (โThe CTA \n18 \nVoluntary Disability Plan provides benefits to members when they become totally \n19 \ndisabled for any reason.โ).  Such insurance is necessary to, among other things, \n20 \nprovide teachers on maternity leave with monies approximating their regular salary.  \n21 \nMost school districts provide only differential pay during maternity leave (that is, \n22 \nโthe amount remaining of your salary after the district pays a substitute to fill your \n23 \nposition,โ CTA, Pregnancy and Parental Leave Rights, \n24 \nhttp://ctainvest.org/home/insurance-estate-planning/disability-long-term/pregnancy-\n25 \nand-parental-leave-rights.aspx), leaving disability insurance to make up the \n26 \n27  difference).  See CTA, Member Benefits; CTA, How is CTA saving you money?, \n28 \n   \n - 16 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 19 of 211   Page ID #:38\n1 \nhttp://www.cta.org/Professional-Development/Publications/2012/12/December-\n2 \n2012-Educator-Magazine/How-CTA-is-saving-you-money.aspx.  \n3 \n65.  The defendant unions invoke teachersโ inability to obtain disability \n4 \ninsurance through their school district employers when encouraging non-members to \n5 \njoin the union.  See, e.g., Kern High Teachers Association Letter (undated) (โIf you \n6 \njoin CTA, you are eligible for income protection [in the event of a disability] \n7 \nthrough the insurance provider The Standard.โ) (attached as Ex. B).  \n8 \n66.  Plaintiffs or their members are subject to these โagency shopโ \n9 \narrangements in the school districts where they teach. \n10 \n67.  In recent years, NEA has deemed approximately 40 percent of its \n11 \nexpenditures to be โchargeable.โ  CTA has deemed approximately 65 percent of its \n12 \nexpenditures to be โchargeable.โ  Local unions often use the same chargeability \n13 \npercentage as CTA.  This practice is apparently based on a โlocal union \n14 \npresumption,โ which presumes that local unions tend to spend as much or more of \n15 \ntheir budgets on collective bargaining as do their state affiliates. \n16 \n68.  Dues and agency fees yield significant revenues for the unions.  For \n17 \nexample, CTAโs revenue in 2009 was $186 million, primarily from membership \n18 \ndues and fees.  In 2011, it was over $191 million, over $178 million of which came \n19 \nfrom membership dues and fees. \n20 \n69.  CTA spent over $211 million in political expenditures from 2000 \n21 \nthrough 2009.  CTAโs largest single expenditure, of over $26 million, was made to \n22 \nsuccessfully oppose Proposition 38 on the 2000 ballot, which would have enacted a \n23 \nschool-voucher system in California and thereby increased the potential employment \n24 \npool for teachers.  CTA also spent over $50 million to oppose three ballot initiatives \n25 \nin 2005, including Proposition 74, which sought to make changes in the \n26 \nprobationary period for California school teachers; Proposition 75, which sought to \n27 \nprohibit the use of public employee agency fees for political contributions without \n28 \n   \n - 17 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 20 of 211   Page ID #:39\n1  individual employeesโ prior consent; and Proposition 76, concerning state spending \n2  and minimum school-funding requirements.  See California Fair Political Practices \n3  Commission, Big Money Talks, at 11-12 (Mar. 2010), \n4  http://www.fppc.ca.gov/reports/Report38104.pdf.  CTA also takes public positions \n5  on a wide range of issues both related and unrelated to the educational system.  For \n6  example, CTA opposes school vouchers (CTA, Issues & Action:  Vouchers, \n7  http://www.cta.org/Issues-and-Action/Education-Reform/Vouchers.aspx) and \n8  supports immigration reform that provides โtimely legalization without regard to \n9  national originโ (CTA, Issues in Action:  Immigration, http://www.cta.org/en/Issues-\n10  and-Action/Ongoing-Issues/Immigration.aspx).   \n11  70.  CTA is a major donor to the California Democratic Party.  From 2003 \n12  to 2012, CTA spent nearly $102 million on political contributions, with only 0.08 \n13  percent of that money going to Republicans.  See  Troy Senik, The Worst Union in \n14  America, City Journal (Spring 2012). CTA also spends money on direct political \n15  advocacy, much of which is on issues with no connection to education.  For \n16  example, the California Teachers Association spent over $1 million in opposition to \n17  Proposition 8 (the gay marriage initiative).  See, e.g., Evelyn Larrubia, $1 million \n18  from teachersโ union to oppose Prop. 8, L.A. Times (Oct. 17, 2008), \n19  http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/17/local/me-teachers17.  \n20  71.  CTA also encourages its members to engage in extensive political \n21  activism in the public schools where they work.  For example, as part of a recent \n22  campaign to lobby the State Legislature on school funding issues, see State of \n23  Emergency, About (explaining the reasons for CTAโs lobbying campaign), \n24  http://castateofemergency.com/?page_id=158, CTA distributed a list of practices \n25  that it suggested to its teacher-members as ways to further CTAโs campaign in their \n26  classrooms.  For example, CTA suggested that teachers: \n27  (cid:120)  โTake ยฝ photo of Assembly members and have kids draw the other half \n28  with a message stating what they want for their teachers,โ State of \n   \n - 18 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 21 of 211   Page ID #:40\n1  Emergency, State Council Ideas for Potential Activities, at 1, \n2  http://www.eiaonline.com/CTAStateofEmergencyIdeas.pdf,  \n3  (cid:120)  Have their โstudents create a BIG poster on a school bus that is sent to \n4  Sacramento,โ id. at 5,  \n5  (cid:120)  Organize a โStudent Video Contestโ in which those teachers would \n6  conduct a โcontest for youth to create a video about what education \n7  costs would mean to them,โ id. at 10. \n8  72.  In coordination with their express political advocacy, Californiaโs \n9  teachersโ unions routinely take positions in the collective-bargaining process that \n10  have profound political and budgeting consequences.  \n11  73.  NEA likewise engages in widespread political advocacy on a wide \n12  range of issues.  This includes support for firearm restrictions (NEA, Sign the \n13  petition to keep students safe from gun violence, http://educationvotes.nea.org/gun-\n14  violence-petition/) and support for the Affordable Care Act (NEA, Affordable \n15  Health Care for America, http://www.nea.org/home/16326.htm). \n16  74.  CTA classifies expenditures as being โchargeableโโand thus germane \n17  to collective bargainingโeven when those expenditures appear to have little to do \n18  with collective bargaining.  For example, in 2010-2011: \n19  (cid:120)  CTA classified its expenditures on โHuman Rights Programs,โ including a \n20  โGay/Lesbian Program,โ as being 100% chargeable.  See CTA Combined \n21  Financial Statement, at 21 (Aug. 31, 2011) (attached as Ex. C), \n22  (cid:120)  CTA classified a โGLBT Conferenceโ as being 71.3% chargeable, id. at \n23  23, and  \n24  (cid:120)  CTA also deems publication and dissemination of its internal magazine, \n25  The California Educator, to be 78.4% chargeable, id. at 20. \n26  Further, while the documents that CTA gives to teachers do not provide much detail \n27  on the activities underlying the listed charges, those documents do further reflect \n28  that CTA deems โRegional Servicesโ to be 93.1% chargeable, id. at 17, despite \n   \n - 19 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 22 of 211   Page ID #:41\n1  โRegional Servicesโ appearing to contain expenditures on numerous activities of a \n2  non-bargaining-related nature.  See id. at 28-29 (listing as several targets of \n3  โemphasisโ in 2010-2011, โ[e]xpanding the CTA membership baseโ; โ[a]ssistance \n4  with chapter organizationโ; โidentification and development of local issuesโ; \n5  โ[o]rganizing and training for political action and community outreachโ). \n6  75.  CTA maintains that โ[c]hargeable expenses generally include those \n7  related toโ policy strategizing or public polling.  Id at 34.  (โ[s]trategic planning and \n8  polling on priorities for association activitiesโ). \n9  76.  NEA likewise classifies expenditures as โchargeableโ even when those \n10  expenditures appear to have little to do with collective bargaining.  For example, in \n11  2010-2011, NEA deemed โ[p]rovide technical and financial support to affiliates \n12  engaged in or preparing to engage in comprehensive salary campaignsโ to be 76% \n13  chargeable.  See NEA Combined Financial Statements at 28 (Aug. 31, 2011) \n14  (attached as Ex. D).  NEA likewise deemed: \n15  (cid:120)  โProvide resources to assist affiliates build capacity to support their \n16  initiatives designed to advance pro-public education policies for \n17  student learning and workforce quality,โ to be 91.5% chargeable, id., \n18  (cid:120)  โAffiliate programs and services that increase membership,โ to be \n19  73.38% chargeable, id., \n20  (cid:120)  โ[B]uild[ing] affiliate capacity for membership growth through project \n21  funding and constituency group assistance,โ to be 81% chargeable, id. \n22  at 35, \n23  (cid:120)  โFacilitate[] the development of NEA strategy and operations,โ \n24  โ[i]mplement[] workplace culture initiative,โ and โ[m]aintain[] NEA \n25  records archives,โ to be 80.9% chargeable, NEA Letter, Chargable & \n26  Nonchargeble Audited Expenditures for the 2010-2011 Fiscal Year, at \n27  15 (Aug. 9, 2012) (attached as Ex.

NEA has โdetermined that chargeable activities and expenditures were \n15  related toโ expenditures that are devoted to setting employment terms in public \n16  schools that affect core education policy, NEA Combined Financial Statement, at 41 \n17  (Ex.

Californiaโs โAgency Shopโ Law Violates the First Amendment \n21  78.  Californiaโs agency-shop arrangement violates the First Amendment \n22  rights of Plaintiffs and other public-school teachers who are not voluntary union \n23  members.  There is no justificationโmuch less a compelling oneโfor mandating \n24  that Plaintiffs make contributions to support collective bargaining and the other \n25  activities of Californiaโs teachersโ unions, which are among the most powerful and \n26  politically controversial organizations in the State.  Particularly given the inherently \n27  political nature of collective bargaining and its profound economic consequences, \n28  the First Amendment forbids coercing any money from Plaintiffs to fund so-called \n   \n - 21 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 24 of 211   Page ID #:43\n1  โchargeableโ union expenditures.  Moreover, even if the First Amendment did \n2  somehow tolerate conditioning public employment on subsidizing the unions, there \n3  is still no justification for forcing Plaintiffs and other teachers to pay for political \n4  and ideological activitiesโexpenditures that the unions themselves admit are โnon-\n5  chargeableโ under the First Amendmentโunless they affirmatively โopt outโ of \n6  making payments each year. \nA.  Conditioning Public Employment on the Payment of Mandatory Fees to \n7 \nSupport Collective Bargaining is Unconstitutional. \n8 \n79.  As the Supreme Court has explained, โcompulsory subsidies for private \n9 \nspeech are subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained \n10 \nunless two criteria are met.  First, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme \n11 \ninvolving a โmandated associationโ among those who are required to pay the \n12 \nsubsidy.โ  Knox, 132 S. Ct. at 2289 (citing United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 \n13 \nU.S. 405, 414 (2001)).  โSuch situations are exceedingly rare because . . . mandatory \n14 \nassociations are permissible only when they serve a compelling state interest . . . that \n15 \ncannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational \n16 \nfreedoms.โ  Id. (citation omitted).  โSecond, even in the rare case where a mandatory \n17 \nassociation can be justified, compulsory fees can be levied only insofar as they are a \n18 \nโnecessary incidentโ of the โlarger regulatory purpose which justified the required \n19 \nassociation.โโ Id. (quoting United Foods, 533 U.S. at 414). \n20 \n80.  Agency-shop arrangements impose a โsignificant impingement on First \n21 \nAmendment rightsโ because โ[t]he dissenting employee is forced to support \n22 \nfinancially an organization with whose principles and demands he may disagree.โ  \n23 \nEllis v. Bhd. of Ry., Airline & S.S. Clerks, 466 U.S. 435, 455 (1984)).  This \n24 \nโimpingementโ is quite severe because โpublic-sector union[s] take[] many positions \n25 \nduring collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.โ  \n26 \nKnox, 132 S. Ct. at 2289. \n27 \n28 \n   \n - 22 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 25 of 211   Page ID #:44\n1  81.  Moreover, โany procedure for exacting [union] fees from unwilling \n2  contributors must be carefully tailored to minimize the infringement of free speech \n3  rights.โ  Id. at 2291 (citation omitted).  By contrast, โunions have no constitutional \n4  entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.โ  Id. (citation omitted).  Rather, \n5  their โcollection of fees from nonmembers is authorized by an act of legislative \n6  grace.โ  Id. (citation omitted). \n7 \n82.  Californiaโs agency-shop arrangement does not serve any compelling \n8 \nstate interest, nor is it narrowly tailored to serve whatever interest the State may \n9 \nhave.  There is no compelling or even persuasive evidence that compulsory agency \n10 \nfees are needed to achieve โlabor peaceโ in California or its public schools, or that \n11 \nsuch a compulsory policy is the least restrictive means of securing equitable policies \n12 \nin public employment. \n13 \nB.  The โOpt Outโ Requirement for Non-Chargeable Expenditures is \n14  Unconstitutional. \n15  83.  Under the Stateโs agency-shop provisions, any public school teacher \n16  who wishes to withhold contributions to unionsโ non-chargeable expenditures must \n17  write a letter each year expressing that wish.  CTA must receive this letter by a hard \n18  deadline or the request to opt out will be denied and the teacher will be required to \n19  pay full dues for the subsequent year.  No matter how many years in a row a non-\n20  member has opted out of paying the political portion of agency fees, that non-\n21  member must still send a letter each year to CTA in order to successfully opt out.   \n22  84.  This requirement to pay for political and ideological activities absent \n23  annual, affirmative disapproval constitutes a serious burden on the First Amendment \n24  rights of public employees.  It also creates an environment susceptible to contrary \n25  pressure by union personnel.  Finally, given the strong likelihood that individuals \n26  who choose not to join the union prefer not to subsidize the unionโs explicitly \n27  political expenditures by paying full agency fees, nonmembers should be presumed \n28  to be non-contributors unless they affirmatively โopt in.โ  In short, the Constitution \n   \n - 23 - \n \n \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 26 of 211   Page ID #:45\n1  requires unions seeking political donations to solicit those donations from non-\n2  members through the ordinary process of voluntary, affirmative consent. \n3 \n85.  Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), upheld the \n4 \nconstitutionality of compelling payment of agency fees by public employees and \n5 \nMitchell v. Los Angeles Unified School District, 963 F.2d 258 (9th Cir. 1992), \n6 \nupheld requiring non-members to โopt outโ of paying the โnon-chargeableโ share of \n7 \ndues.

Mandated duties such as IEP meetings, parent conferences, and \nstaff meetings significantly extend the teaching day past seven hours. Acknowledging \nthis commitment and service, teachers will have latitude and flexibility in the use of \nnon-instructional time during the seven-hour duty day.  A duty day, beginning time \nand ending time, will be established.  By notifying the Program Administrator, the \nteacher may take non-instructional time for personal convenience.

This student supervision time (contact time) has increased with the program \ndirective that mandates that county-operated classes be aligned with district classes for \nthe daily beginning and ending times. \nTo address the instructional, supervision, and teacher preparation requirements during \nthe workday, it is acknowledged that there is teacher judgment on blending these \ncomponents.  Teachers, through collaboration with the program supervisors, shall \nidentify regularly scheduled periods during the student day that will allow for non \ninstructional program-related work to be completed. It is also expected that there will \nbe opportunities for the teacher to complete non-instructional program-related duties \nwhile students are on task and supervised by an Instructional Assistant or other \napproved supervisory staff. \nNothing in these statements is intended to distract or encroach on the instructional \nminutes as set by statute, or decrease the quality of instruction.  It is acknowledged \nthat non-instructional program-related duties are an essential part of the instructional \nprogram.  Detailed planning, the completion of records, and IEPs are fundamental to \nthe educational program. \n13/48 \nSLOCEA/CTA  - SLOCOE  AGREEMENT  - 2012-2015 \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 47 of 211   Page ID #:66\nAlternative Education and Special Education - StaffDevelopmentlln-senlices \n5.15. 7 The COE may require teachers to attend staff development/in-service only during the \ncontract workday and work year.

SUITE#202  VICKIE SHOENHAIR, VICE PRESIDENT \nBAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA 93312  MINDY MONTANIO, SECRETARY \nUSA LAYSHOT, TREASURER \nDear KHSTA   Non-Member: \nI'd like you to know that I respect your decision to not join our Association, but I also feel \ncompelled to share with you an opportunity that you may not be aware exists.  Some of the most \nheart wrenching situations that I've dealt with since becoming the Association President occur \nwhen members are critically ill, and they use up all of their sick time.  The double whammy of \ndealing with a health problem and a financial problem at the same time can be an emotional roller \ncoaster that can bring the afflicted to the brink. \nWhen you exhaust your sick leave, you go on what is known as \"differential pay\" for up to I 00 \ndays where the district deducts from your check the cost of a substitute teacher.  Most people that \nfind themselves in this situation require a long term sub that gets paid the same as a new teacher. \nIf you are extremely ill, you may exceed the I 00 day max losing your job and all income. \nIf you join CTA  , you are eligible for income protection through the insurance provider The \nStandard. The product they have offered is far superior to anything else I've come across.  I've \nincluded information on the rates and a description of the benefits provided in this packet.  Feel \nfree to investigate and compare. \nFor the next month, all members of the Association will be able to get this insurance without \nhaving to state a pre-existing condition. Normally, if you do not sign up when you are first hired \nwith the district, the insurance company can require that you fill out a medical questionnaire and \nwill deny your coverage if you're sick or have a history of disease.  We have gotten the company \nto agree to waive this requirement and you will be given a guarantee issue as long as we can get \n80 people across the district to participate. \nOn the back of this letter is a letter written by one of our colleagues talking about how this \nincome protection saved he and his family.  It is both sad and inspiring.  I encourage you to read \nit.  It is a powerful testimonial.  Additionally, we have provided you with aCTA   membership \nform if you decide to reconsider your decision so that you can avail yourself to this great product. \nIf you would like to know more details, please talk to the site representative on your campus. \nRegards, \nMitch Olson, President \nKern High School Teachers Association \nCALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION \nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOClATION \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 105 of 211   Page ID #:124\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit C \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 106 of 211   Page ID #:125\nCalifornia Teachers \nAssociation \nCombined Financial Statements for the \nYear Ended August 31, 2011, and Supplemental \nSummary and Detail Schedules of Nonchargeable \nand Chargeable Expenditures of Agency Fees \nfor the Year Ended August 31, 2011, and \nIndependent Auditors' Report \n~ยท \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 107 of 211   Page ID #:126\nCALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT \nCOMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE \nYEAR ENDED AUGUST 31,2011: \nStatement of Financial Position  2 \nStatement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets  3 \nStatement of Cash Flows  4 \nNotes to Combined Financial Statements  5-12 \nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES:  13 \nSummary of Nonchargeable and Chargeable Expenditures of Agency Fees for 201(}--201 1  14 \nSupplemental Detail ofNonchargeable and Chargeable Expenditures of Agency Fees \nfor 201(}--2011  15-26 \nNotes to the Summary and Supplemental Detail Schedules ofNonchargeable and \nChargeable Expenditures of Agency Fees for 201(}--2011 by Major Budget Category  27-35 \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 108 of 211   Page ID #:127\nDeloitteG \nOeloltte & Touche lLP \n555 Mission Street \nSuite 1400 \nsan Frand$co, CA 94105 \nUSA \nTe1:+1415 7834000 \nwww.deloltte.com \nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT \nTo the Board of Directors of \nCalifornia Teachers Association: \nWe have audited the accompanying combined statement of financial position of the California Teachers \nAssociation (the \"Association,\" a California not-for-profit corporation) as of August 31, 2011, and the \nrelated combined statements of activities and changes in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended. \nThese combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Association's management. Our \nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audit. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes \nconsideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of \nthe Association's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An \naudit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the \ncombined financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made \nby management, as well as evaluating the overall combined financial statement presentation. We believe \nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nIn our opinion, such combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the combined \nfinancial position of the Association as of August 31, 2011, and the combined changes in its net assets \nand its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States of America. \nOur audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic combined financial \nstatements taken as a whole. The accompanying summary and detail schedules of nonchargeable and \nchargeable expenditures of agency fees for the year ended August 31,2011, on pages 13 through 35 are \npresented for the purpose of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic combined financial \nstatements. This supplementary information is the responsibility oft he Association's management and \nwas derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the \nfinancial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit \nof the basic combined financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and \nreconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the \nfinancial statements or to the fmancial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in \naccordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United Statements. 1n our opinion, such \ninfonnation is fairly stated in all material respects when considered in relation to the basic combined \nfinancial statements taken as a whole. \nDecember 22, 2011, except as to the summary and detail schedules of nonchargeable and chargeable \nexpenditures of agency fees, Note 13, and subsequent event in Note 1 for which the date is October 5, \n2012. \nM~ol \nDdolne Toudle Totwnauu Umlttd \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 109 of 211   Page ID #:128\nCALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION \nCOMBINED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION \nAS OF AUGUST 31  2011 \nASSETS \nCURRENT ASSETS: \nCash and cash equivalents  $  37,237,365 \nShort-tenn investments  68,329,421 \nMembership dues and accounts receivable -

ORGANIZATION \nThe California Teachers Association (the \"Association\" or CTA  ) is a California not-for-profit \ncorporation organized to advance the interests of the teaching profession and to promote and improve \npublic education in the state. The Association bas controlling interest of the California Teachers \nAssociation Institute for Teaching (the \"Institute\"), an affiliate that was created in 1968 and that \nprovides educational programs. The Association also has controlling interest of the California Teachers \nAssociation Disaster Relief Fund (the ''Fund\"), which was created to provide disaster relief assistance \nfor members impacted by natural and other disasters and California Teachers Association Foundation for \nTeaching and Learning (the \"Foundation'~ which was created in 2008 to support high-quality teaching \nand high-quality public schools in the state of California, to make grants of scholarships to qualified \nstudents, to provide disaster relief, and to perform all things incidental to or appropriate for the \nachievement of said specific purposes. \nThe accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting \nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America C'generally \naccepted accounting principles\"). Management has evaluated subsequent events during the period from \nAugust 31,201 I to December 22,2011, and has updated this assessment through October 5, 2012, the \ndate the combined financial statements were available to be issued. \n2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nPrinciples of Combination -The accompanying combined financial statements include the accounts \nof the Association and its affiliates, the Institute, the Fund, and the Foundation. All significant \nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nUse of Estimates-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted \naccounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent \nassets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements and the reported amounts of \nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nRevenues and Expenses- Membership dues are recognized as earned on the accrual basis of \naccounting. Dues received prior to being earned are reported as deferred income until such time as they \nare earned. Other income consists principally of interest and dividends and both realized and unrealized \ngains and losses on investments and payments from affiliates. Other ancillary revenues, such as rent, \nfees, advertising, and reimbursements are not considered to be central to the Association's operation and \nare offset against related expenses. \nExpenses are recognized when incurred on the accrual basis of accounting. \nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Association considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity \nof three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Financial instruments that potentially \nsubject the Association to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents, short-term \ninvestments, membership dues, and accounts receivable. \n-5-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 113 of 211   Page ID #:132\nInvestments -Investments consist of marketable equity securities, certificates of deposit with original \nmaturities greater than 90 days, treasury bills, corporate bonds, and liquid asset funds. Investments are \nstated at fair market value or at amounts approximating fair market value. Fair market value of \nmarketable equity securities is based upon the last quoted market price on the last business day of the \nfiscal year. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are calculated using the weighted \naverage method. \nInvestments in fixed-income securities that mature over one year from the date of the combined \nstatements of financial position are classified as long-term investments. \nMembership Dues - Membership dues and accounts receivable expose the Association to certain \ncredit risks. The Association manages its risk by regularly reviewing its accounts and contracts and by \nproviding allowances for uncollectible accounts. \nThe Association collects membership dues and fees on behalf of the National Education Association and \nothers and periodically remits these dues and fees to these organizations. Such dues and fees are not \nrecognized as membership revenue but instead reported as dues payable to affiliated organizations. \nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation \nand amortization of property and equipment are computed using the straight-line method over estimated \nuseful lives as follows: \nBuildings  15-40 years \nFurniture and equipment  3-10 years \nLeasehold improvements  Life of lease or estimated useful life, \nwhichever is shorter \nAccrued Vacation, Sick Leave, and Other Related Costs-Accrued vacation, sick leave, and other \nrelated costs are accrued as earned. Such costs are allocated between current and long-term liabilities \nbased on estimates of settlement dates. Upon termination, employees are entitled to compensation for \naccrued vacation. All employees are allowed to carry over balances of unused sick leave to the following \nyears. Upon termination, unused sick leave is generally forfeited. If an employee retires, accrued sick \nleave is credited to years of service for purposes of determining retirement benefits. Eligible employees \naccrue postemployment benefits paid upon termination.  Such accrual is estimated based on employment \nagreement terms, years of service, estimated forfeitures, and estimated salary increases. The Association \nparticipates in a rnultiemployer pension plan (the \"Plan\"). The Association is contractually obligated to \nmake lump-sum payments to the Plan for additional service credit for employees who retire with unused \nearned sick days. The additional service credit is based on formulas in the respective employment \ncontracts. \nIncome Taxes - The Association, the Institute, the Fund, and the Foundation are entities described in \nthe Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 50 I (c). Consequently, these entities are generally exempt from \nfederal and state income taxes under IRC Section 501 (a) and the corresponding California statute \nwhereby only unrelated business income, as defined by Section 512(a)(I) of the IR.C, is subject to \nfederal income tax. \nNet Assets -The Association classifies its net assets as unrestricted and temporarily restricted. \nTemporarily Restricted- Net assets subject to externally imposed restrictions that can be fulfilled by \nthe actions of the Association or by the passage of time. \n-6-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 114 of 211   Page ID #:133\nUnrestricted-Net assets are not subject to externally imposed restrictions. Unrestricted net assets may \nbe designated for use by the Board of Directors of the Association. Such designations limit the area of \nAssociation's operations for which expenditures of designated net assets may be made. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements -In January 2010, the FA  SB issued ASU 201 0-06, Improving \nDisclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which, among other things, amends ASC 820 to require \nentities to separately present purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of Level 3 \nfair value measurements (i.e. to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis), and which \nclarifies existing disclosure requirements provided by ASC 820 regarding the level of disaggregation and \nthe inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either \nLevel2 or Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2010-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning af:ter \nDecember 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the \nroll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements (which are effective for fiscal years \nbeginning after December 15, 20 l 0). Effective September 1, 2010, the Association has adopted ASU \n2010-06, which did not have a material impact on the combined financial statements. \n3.  INVESTMENTS \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, a \nframework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used \nto measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The \ntbre~ \nlevel fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets \nor liabilities (Level 1) , securities not traded on an active market but for which observable market inputs \nare readily available (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). \n-7-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 115 of 211   Page ID #:134\nThe following table summarizes the Association's investments as of August 31, 2011 under the ASC \n820 fair value hierarchy levels: \nFair Value Measurements at August 31, 2011 \nLevel1  Level2  Level3  Total \nCertificates of deposit  $  $  413,004  $  $  413,004 \nMutual funds \nBlend funds  2,853,797  2,853,797 \nEquity funds  22,410,339  22,410,339 \nFixed income fu.nds  10,763,971  10,763.971 \nCommodity funds  2,073,229  2,073,229 \nOther  319,449  319,449 \nCommon stocks \nBasic materials  2,760,705  2,760,705 \nCapital goods  297,316  297,316 \nConsumer goods  3,682,273  3,682,273 \nConsumer services  310,219  310,219 \nEnergy  3,148,391  3,148,391 \nFinancial services  2,589,567  2,589,567 \nHealth care  1,923,855  ] ,923,855 \nIndustrial materials  1,894,416  1,894,416 \nTechnology  2,121,144  2,121,144 \nTelecommunications  1,133,048  1,133,048 \nUtilities  459,613  459,613 \nOther  995,486  995,486 \nPreferred securities  5,974,884  1,037,520  7,012,404 \nU.S.govenunentbonds  258,845  1,140  259,985 \nCorporate bonds \nDomestic corporate obligations  15,991,466  15,991,466 \nInternational corporate obligations  544,488  544,488 \nGovernment securities  369,662  369,662 \nMunicipal bonds  111821094  111821094 \nTot.al  $  66,340,209  $ 19,169,712  $  $  85,509,921 \nThe investment gain (loss) in the accompanying combined statement of activities and changes in \nunrestricted net assets for the year ended August 31, 2011, is summarized as follows: \nInterest and dividends  $2,392,272 \nNet unrealized gain  2,730,755 \nNet realized gain (Joss)  2,759,566 \nInvestment income (Joss)  $7,8821593 \n-8-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 116 of 211   Page ID #:135\n4.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \nThe Association provides retirement benefits to substantially all employees through participation in a \nmultiernployer defined benefit retirement plan. In addition, under a health and welfare plan, the \nAssociation provides health insurance benefits to substantially all employees on a defmed contribution \nbasis and to certain retired employees on a defined benefit basis. Each plan is administered by a Joint \nBoard of Trustees. Contributions to these plans are determined by provisions of negotiated labor \ncontracts. \nThe Association maintains a 401(k) Retirement Plan (the \"40l(k) Plan\") covering substantially all full \ntime employees. The Association contributes annually to the 401(k:) Plan based on the 401(k) Plan's \nprovisions in accordance with employment agreements. \nContributions at August 31,2011, to the plans by the Association were as follows: \nDefmed benefit retirement plan  $18,265,045 \nHealth and welfare plan  15,934,246 \n401(k) plan  2,314,883 \n-9-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 117 of 211   Page ID #:136\n7.

At August 31, 2011, there were no balances outstanding on the revolving loans. \nThe agreements expire on September 30,2012 and 2017, respectively. \nThe Association is in compliance with the financial covenants of its revolving loan agreements. \n9.  LEASES \nCapital Leases - The Association leases certain equipment under capital lease arrangements.

DESIGN AT  ED NET ASSETS \nThe following funds have been designated by the Association's Board of Directors for specific pwposes: \nDebt Service Fund-This fund was established for the purpose of debt servicing and reduction. \nPolitical Allocation Fund-This fund serves as a funding structure through which the Association's \nmembers may give support for certain state and local issues and candidates for office. \nPublic Information Program Fund (\"Media Fund\")- The purpose of this fund is to provide for \nadvertisements to educate the public about the achievements, the problems, and the needs of public \neducation from preschool through graduate school. \nInitiative Fund- This fund was established for the purpose of participating in the support of or \nopposition to certain ballot measures. \nAdvocacy Fund- The purpose of the fund is to promote policies to improve and fight back attacks on \npublic education. \nDesignated unrestricted net assets at August 31, 2011, are summarized below: \nIncrease \n(Decrease) In \nBalance at  Designated  Balance at \nAugust31,  Net Assets  August 31, \n2010  During the Year  2011 \nDebt Service Fund  $  4,902,592  $  137,815  $  5,040,407 \nPolitical Allocation Fund  331,975  (87,169)  244,806 \nMedia Fund  3,604,291  (1 ,994,057)  1,610,234 \nInitiative Fund  10,786,356  (2,425, I 67)  8,361,189 \nAdvocacy Fund  2,846,498  692,054  3,538,552 \nTotal  $22,471,712  $ ~3,676,524)  $18,795,188 \n- 11 -\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 119 of 211   Page ID #:138\n11.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \nIn the ordinary course of business, the Association is a party to claims and legal actions by members, \nvendors, and others. The Association's policy is to accrue for amounts related to these claims and legal \nactions if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably \nestimated. The combined financial statements reflect any liabilities that meet the policy described above. \nAfter consulting with legal counsel, the Association management is of the opinion that any liability that \nmay ultimately result of claims or legal actions will not have a material effect on the combined financial \nposition or results of operations of the Association. \n13.  CORRECTION OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITY PRESENTATION ON STATEMENT OF CASH \nFWWS \nSubsequent to the issuance of the 2011 combined financial statements, management determined that, \nunder generally accepted accounting principles, purchases and sales of investments should be presented \non a gross, rather than net, basis in the combined statement of cash flows. Accordingly, the presentation \nof investing activity in the accompanying 2011 statement of cash flows has been corrected from Net \npurchase and sales of investments of($2,371,865) to separate line items ofPurchases of investments \n($45,438,800) and Sales of investments ($43,066,935). This correction had no effect on net cash used in \ninvesting activities. \nโข โขโขโขโขโข \n- 12-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 120 of 211   Page ID #:139\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES \n- 13-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 121 of 211   Page ID #:140\nCALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION \nSUMMARY OF NONCHARGEABLE AND CHARGEABLE \nEXPENDITURES OF AGENCY FEES FOR 2010ยท2011 (NOTE 1) \nBudget Category  Expenditures  Nonehorgllllble  o/o  Chargeable  %  Allocablo  % \n(Note 2)  (Note 3)  (Note 4) \nGovernance  $  10,445,126  s  483.400  4.6%  s  8,483,343  81.2%  s1 ,478,383  14.2% \nGovernmental Relations  7,607,773  7,607,773  100.0% \nAssociation for Better Citizenship  7,924,156  7,924,156  100.0% \nLegal Services  9,205,221  5,380,060  58.4%  3,825,161  41.6% \nRegional Services  71,537,655  4,911,941  6.9%  66,625,714  93.1% \nNegotiations and Organizational Development  7,077,841  243,076  3.4%  6,834,765  96.6% \nTraining, lnfonnation & Development  1,863,950  1,081,964  58.0%  781,986  42.0% \nCommunications  6,180,021  2,824,426  45.7%  3,355,595  54.3% \nHuman RighWCommunity Outreach  4,929,365  2,269,445  46.00/o  2,659,920  54.0% \nInstruction and Professional Development  2,902,994  160,611  5.5%  2,742,383  94.5% \nAccounting  5,957,304  5,957,304  100.0% \nBusiness Ser\\'ices  929,318  929,318  100.0% \nCentral Services  2,858,484  2,858,484  100.0% \nConfeta~ce Coordination Center  2,263,586  470,407  20.8%  1,793,179  79.2% \nGovernance Support  2,236,167  102,863  4.6%  1,815,767  81.2%  317,537  14.2% \nHuman Resources Management  1,851,127  1,851,127  100.0% \nIntegrated Systems and Strategies  4,223,508  11,524  0.3%  4.211,984  99.7% \nManagement  4,971,145  349,255  7.00/o  1,124,684  22.6%  3,497,206  70.4% \nOccupancy/Properties  5,332,913  406,334  7.6%  4,926,579  92.4% \nCapital Expenditures/Depreciation  3,711,851  370,832  10.00/o  3,341,019  90.0% \nDebt Reduction and Service  182,571  182,571  100.0% \nCrisis Assistuncc Fund  140,649  140,649  100.0% \nAdvocacy/Foundation  1,338,704  1,338,704  100.0% \nMedia Advertising Fund  6,101,241  6,101,241  100.0% \nInitiative Fund  15,370,766  15,370,766  100.0% \nSubtotal  187,143,436  57,408,778  31.6%  124,441,532  68.4%  5,293,126 \nAllocable Expenditures  1,672,628  3,620,498  $5,293.126 \ns  s \nTotal Nonchargeable and Chargeable Expenditures  187,143,436  $59.081,406  128,062,030 \nFinal Nonchargeable and Chargeable Percentages  _ill%  ~% \nSee notes to the summary and supplemental detail schedule ofn onchargeable and chargeable expenditures ofa gency fees. \n- 14-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 122 of 211   Page ID #:141\nCALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION \nSUPPLEMENTAL DETAIL OF NONCHARGEABLE AND CHARGEABLE \nEXPENDITURES OF AGENCY FEES FOR 2010-2011 \nTotal \nGovernance  Expenses  Nonchargeable  %  Chargeable  %  Allocable  % \nDepartmental Programs: \nI .0 State Council of Education  $  2,944,108  $ 147,205  S.O%  $2,796,903  95.0%  $  - - % \n2.0 NEA Convention  925,485  925,485  100.0% \n3.0 Advisory Groups  826,841  336,195  40.7%  490,646  59.3% \n4.0 Board of Directors  4,270,309  4,270,309  100.0% \n5.0 Executive Officers  1,478,383  1,478,383  100.0% \nGovernance  $10,445,126  $483,400  $8,483,343  $1,478,383 \nDepartmental Nonchargeable, Chargeable \n- - -\nand Allocable Percentages  4.6%  81.2%  14.2% \nSee notes to the summary and supplemental detail schedule of nonchargeable and chargeable expenditures of agency fees.

AGENCY FEE NONCHARGEABLE AND CHARGEABLE EXPENDITURES CALCULATION \nThe California Teachers Association (\"Association\" or \"CTA\") is required by law to have procedures in \neffect to detennine the amount of its expenditures which can be charged to objecting agency fee payers \nfor \"representational\" or \"chargeable\" purposes, i.e., generally those related to collective bargaining, \nconsultation, contract administration, and employee representation related to terms and conditions of \nยทemployment. \nBased on relevant federal and state judicial and administrative decisions, the Association analyzed its \nexpenditures and determined which of those expenditures were nonchargeable to objecting agency fee \npayers and which were chargeable to objecting agency fee payers. \nThe Association's annual expenses are divided into major departmental budget categories. For agency \nfee purposes, these budget categories are designated as either \"non-allocable\" or \"allocable.\" The \nAssociation's non-allocable budget categories are: Governance (non-allocable portions only); \nGovernmental Relations; Association for Better Citizenship; Legal Services; Regjonal Services; \nNegotiations and Organizational Development; Training, Information & Development; \nCommunications; Human Rights/Community Outreach; Instruction and Professional Development; \nAccounting; Business Services; Central Services; Conference Coordination Center; Governance Support \n(non-allocable portions only); Human Resources Management; Integrated Systems and Strategies; \nManagement (non-allocable portions only); Occupancy/Properties; Capital Expenditmes/Depreciation; \nCrisis Assistance Fund; Advocacy/Foundation; Media Advertising Fund; Initiative Fund. The \nAssociation's allocable budget categories are: Governance (allocable portions only); Governance \nSupport (allocable portions only); Management (allocable portions only). \nExpenditures in non-allocable budget categories are analyzed according to the type of activity involved \nand are categorized as \"nonchargeable\" or \"chargeable.\" See Notes 3 and 4, below, for defmitions of \nnonchargeable and chargeable activities. Once all non-allocable budget categories have been analyzed \nfor nonchargeable and chargeable expenditures, such expenditures are totaled and the overall \nnonchargeable and chargeable percentages for all non-allocable budget categories are determined. \nExpenditures in budget categories designated allocable are allocated as nonchargeable or chargeable in \nproportion to these percentages. \nAll nonchargeable and chargeable expenditures are totaled. These totals provide the Final \nNonchargeable and Chargeable Percentages. \nThe Summary ofNonchargeable and Chargeable Expenditures of Agency Fees for 2010-2011 by Major \nBudget Category represents, to the best of the Associationโขs knowledge and belief, the Association's \nactual nonchargeable and chargeable expenditures for the 2010-201 I year. The calculations have been \nprepared using historical costs incurred by the Association during the year ended August 31, 2011, \nwhich have been included in the Association's audited financial statements, and the application of \nvarious assumptions in the allocation of these costs as nonchargeable and chargeable as discussed in the \naccompanying notes. \n-27-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 135 of 211   Page ID #:154\n2.

EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2011 AND 2010 \nl.  ORGANIZATION \nThe National Education Association of the United States (\"NEA\") is a not-for-profit organization \nincorporated under an Act of the United States Congress. Its mission statement read.s: โขโขto advocate for \neducation professionals and to unite our members and the nation to fulfill the promise ofp ublic \neducation to prepare every student to succeed in a diverse and interdependent world.\" \nTo help realize this mission, the NEA adopted a vision of\"a great public school for every student.\" This \nvision guided NEA's strategic plan and budget, which is organized around three Strategic Goals and five \nCore Services Areas. \nThe Strategic Goals address three key challenges: \nโข  School Funding-In partnership with state affiliates, establish public policy in at least six states by \nmobilizing members and the public to build tax and economic infrastructures for achieving adequate \nand equitable funding for public education. \nโข  Salary-Improve starting salaries for teachers, achieve at least a living wage for education support \nprofessionals and assist higher education locals to engage in effective salary campaigns. \nโข  Priority Schools-In partnership with state affiliates and targeted local affiliates, provide support and \nadvocacy to struggling schools, as identified by states, to become a great public school as measured \nby NEA 's criteria and indicators. \nThe Core Service areas of the General Operating Fund address regular, ongoing programs and services: \nโข  Student Learning & Workforce Quality-Promote policies and programs that create teaching and \nlearning conditions that close the achievement gaps and recruit and retain a quality workforce by \nimproving compensation, retirement benefits, and other working conditions of education employees. \nโข  Membership-Partner with state affiliates to provide programs and services that focus on membership \ngrowth, retention and engagement. \nโข  Advocacy-Support pro-public education candidates, influence elected policy makers, advocate \npublic policy and social justice through collective action, and utilize the best communication \nstrategies to engage members and the public. \nโข  Partnership-Develop partnerships that engage the ethnic minority, labor, faith-based, environmental, \nphilanthropic, educational, civil and human rights, and business communities to enhance our ability to \nachieve great public schools for every student. \nโข  Business Operations-Administer the business operations in a manner that supports the changing \nneeds and priorities of the organization and ensures efficient and effective governance and shared \nservices. \n-5-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 151 of 211   Page ID #:170\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2011 AND 2010 \n2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nPrinciples ofC  onsolidation-The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NEA and \nits wholly owned subsidiaries: NEA Properties, Inc. (\"NEAPI\"), NEA's Member Benefits Corporation \n(\"MBC\"), and MBC's wholly-owned subsidiary, the NEA Professional Services Corporation, and an \naffiliated entity, National Education Employees Assistance Fund, Inc., (\"NEEAF'). MBC serves as a \ncontractor for NEA 's member benefits functions. NEEAF is combined with the accounts of NEA due to \ncommon control and an economic interest (Note J0 ). All intercompany accounts and transactions have \nbeen eliminated in consolidation. \nMeasure ofOperations-NEA includes in its measure of operations all revenue and expenses that are \nintegral to its continuing core program services with the key objective being predictability of indicated \nresults. Non-operating income and expenses include unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and defmed \nbenefit pension charges included in Other Comprehensive Income of MBC. \nBasis ofA  ccounting-The accompanying statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. \nTo ensure observance of its bylaws, the resources ofNEA are classified internally for accounting and \nreporting purposes into funds established according to their nature and purpose. The assets, liabilities, \nnet assets, and changes in net assets are reported in the following two fund groups: \nGeneral Fund \nโข  General Operating Fund-The bylaws ofNEA provide that the General Operating Fund shall \ncomprise all income received in the form of dues, interest, dividends, fees, earnings from \nadvertising, sales ofNEA publications, payments for services, and funds received by gift, bequest, \ndevise, or transfer to NEA, which are not specifically designated for deposit in the Capital \nImprovement Fund. \nโข  Special Purpose Funds-NEA has various Special Purpose Funds that consist of funds designated \nfor specific projects and purposes. Special Purpose Funds include activities such as the UniServ \nFund, National Education Employees Assistance Fund (Note 10 ), Special Dues Ballot Fund, \nSpecial Dues Media Fund, Advocacy Fund, Cash Stabilization Fund, and NEA-Retired Program \nFund. These Special Purpose Funds also include the activities ofMBC, which provides support to \nthe Member Benefits Programs, primarily in the areas of administrative, membership services, \naffiliate support, research and development, and marketing. Additionally, on July 22,2009, NEA \nestablished a wholly owned subsidiary, NEA Properties, Inc. NEAPI is a real estate holding \ncompany exempt under section 50l(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. Currently, NEAPI's \nprimary purpose is to hold title to and manage certain commercial real property in Indiana, collect \nincome from that property and periodically surrender the net proceeds derived to NEA. \nCapital Improvement Fund \nโข  The bylaws ofNEA provide that the Capital Improvement Fund shall comprise the properties and \npermanent investments ofNEA and other funds or properties received by gift, devise, bequest, or \ntransfer for deposit in the Fund. Disbursements from the Capital Improvement Fund to acquire new \nproperties or to provide for major long-term improvements in existing properties shall be authorized \n-6-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 152 of 211   Page ID #:171\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nby a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors. Expenditures from this Fund for any other purpose \nshall be authorized by a two-thirds vote of the Representative Assembly. \nUse ofE  stimates-The preparation of fmancial statements in conformity with accounting principles \ngenerally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets \nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses \nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the \ndeferred revenue, useful life offlxed assets, pension liability, reserve for uncollectible, reserve for \ncontingent liabilities, and deferred tax. Actual results could differ materially, in the near term, from the \namounts reported. \nConcentration ofR  isks-Financial instruments that potentially subject NEA to significant \nconcentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash, accounts receivable, and investments. NEA \nplaces its cash in a financial institution that is federally insured under the Federal Depository Insurance \nCorporation Act (. .F DICA\"). At August 31,2011 and 2010, the cash aggregate balances were in excess \nof the FDIC insurance limits by $5,559,795 and $57,037,173, respectively, and therefore, bear some \nrisk, since they were not collateralized. NEA has not experienced any losses on its cash to date related \nto FDICA insurance limits. \nMBC had material revenues from two suppliers representing approximately 42 percent and 42 percent \nof revenues, respectively, for the year ended August 3 J, 2011, and approximately 44 percent and 43 \npercent of revenues, respectively, for the year ended August 31,2010. As of August 31,2011, two \nsuppliers accounted for approximately 34 percent and 44 percent ofMBC's accounts receivable.  As of \nAugust 31, 2010, two suppliers accounted for approximately 50 percent and 32 percent ofMBC's total \naccounts receivable. \nCash and Cash Equivalents-Cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposits and securities with \noriginal maturity ofless than three months when purchased and are recorded at cost, which \napproximates fair value. \nInvestments-Investments consist of mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and common stocks and are \nrecorded at fair value, with any gains or losses reflected in the consolidated statements of activities and \nchanges in net assets. Net realized gains from operating activities were $1,558,185 and $841,311 for the \nyears ended August 31,2011 and August 31,2010, respectively. The net unrealized loss included in \noperating activities was $490,111 and the unrealized loss included in non-operating activities was \n$15,045, for a total net unrealized loss of$505,156 for the year ended August 31,2011. The net \nunrealized loss included in operating activities were $25,517 for the year ended August 31, 2010. \nProperty and Equipment-Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using \nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful \nlives range from 2 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment and 25 to 40 years for buildings \nand leasehold improvements. \nNEA capitalizes direct costs incurred during the application development and implementation stages for \ndeveloping software for internal use.  These software costs are depreciated using the straight-line \n-7-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 153 of 211   Page ID #:172\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nmethod over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three to five years.  AU costs incurred \nduring the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. \nDepreciation expense were $7,444,285 and $8,251,813 for the years ended August 31,2011 and 2010, \nrespectively and is reflected in NEA's support services expenses in the consolidated statements of \nactivities and changes in net assets. \nAccrued Severance Payahle-NEA has a policy entitling employees with over 10 years of service to \nseverance pay equal to 10 weeks of salary. NEA 's accrued severance pay has been calculated to \napproximate in accordance with Accounting Standards for Compensation-Nonretirement \nPostemployment Benefits. \nNEA-Retired Program (11NEA-Retired\")-NEA offers life membership through a Special Purpose \nFund known as the NEA-Retired Program. NEA-Retired dues qualify retired members for certain \nservices provided to active members, as well as services designed specifically for retired persons. NEA \nRetired dues income is recorded as deferred income when received and amortized using the straight-line \nmethod over the estimated life expectancy of its members. \nMembership Dues- Membership dues are recognized as income over the membership year, which is \nSeptember 1 through August 31. Dues are assessed to members as provided in the bylaws. An estimated \nprovision for uncollectibles, write-offs, and cancellations is charged against membership dues revenues. \nln accordance with the bylaws, a percentage of the membership dues is a1Jocated to UniServ grants, \nwhich are included in NEA' s program services expenses, whereby NEA provides grants to state \naffiliates to assist in funding their staff representatives, whose responsibilities are to implement, \nimprove, and coordinate programs ofNEA and the state affiliates. \nProgram Revenue-MBC's program revenues from suppliers represent fees from contracts with \nvarious program suppliers. Fees are recognized as revenue in tbe period in which they are earned. \nRental Revenue--NEAPI rents office space to various tenants. Rental revenue from operating leases is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \nIncome Taxes- In June 2009, the FASB issued interpretation Accounting for Uncertainty in Income \nTax. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial \nstatement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. \nThe interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, \naccounting in interim periods, disclosure) and transition. MBC has adopted the interpretation \nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax effective September 1, 2009. MBC has no uncertain tax \npositions at August 3 1,  2011. \nReclassifications-Certain amounts from the prior year have been reclassified to conform with the \ncurrent year presentation. \n-8-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 154 of 211   Page ID #:173\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \n3.

Future minimum lease payments under these leases are as \nfollows: \nYear Ending \nAugust 31 \n2012  $  160,091 \n2013  70,336 \n2014  14,338 \nTotal future minimum lease payments  $  244,765 \nRental expense for all operating leases was approximately $196,000 and $200,000 during 2011 and \n2010, respectively. \nNEA has been named as a party in several legal matters, the outcome of which cannot presently be \ndetermined. In the opinion of management an appropriate provision has been made to account for \nprobably losses and the ultimate resolution ofthese matters will not have an impact on NEA's \nconsolidated financial position or changes in net assets and cash flows. \nThe Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") examined NEA's income tax returns for the years 2000 through \n2010 and proposed adjustments for those years.  NEA appealed the proposed adjustments and while it \nbelieves the related tax returns are in accordance with prevailing tax rulings it has established a \nprovision of $4,000,000 to cover any obligations that might arise from the unresolved issues. \n8.  BANK LINE OF CREDIT \nNEA had a line of credit from a commercial bank at an interest rate of LIBOR (London Interbank: \nOffered Rate) plus 1.50%. At August 31, 2009, the prevailing rate was 1. 76%.  On October 8, 2009, \nNEA increased its operating line of credit from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000. This line of credit expired \non February 28, 2010.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS \nNEA -Defined Benefit Plan-NEA participates in a multiemployer, defined benefit retirement plan \nwhich was noncontributory for NEA employees and covers substantially all pennanent employees. On \nJune 1, 2009, the plan was amended to require employee contributions at a rate of3.5% for employees \nemployed by NEA on or after June 9, 2009. NEA employs approximately 45.3% of the employees \ncovered under the plan; the remaining 54.7% are employees of participating state and local affiliates of \nNEA. NEA's policy is to fund retirement costs as accrued. \n-11. \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 157 of 211   Page ID #:176\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nNEA's retirement contribution expenses for the years ended August 31, 201I and 2010, respectively, \nwere $25,109,643 and $25,648,677.

For tax benefits to be recognized under this model, the tax position \nrelated to the benefit must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing \nauthorities. MBC evaluated its tax positions and bas determined that it does not have any uncertain tax \npositions. Accordingly, it does not recognize a liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax \nbenefits in its financial statements for the year ended August 3 1, 20 11. At August 31, 2011, tax years \n2007 through 20 I 0 remain open to examination under the statute of limitations. \n15.

FAIRVALUEMEASUREMENTS \nAccounting standards for fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for \nmeasuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Accounting standards for \nfair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. That \nframework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to \nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets \nfor identical assets or liabilities (Level l measurements) and the Jowest priority to measurements \ninvolving significant unobservable inputs (Leve13 measurements). The three levels of the hierarchy are \nas follows: \nโข  Level I - Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active \nmarkets; \nโข  Level 2 โข Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable, either \ndirectly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, \n-23-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 169 of 211   Page ID #:188\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than \nquoted prices that are observable or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by \nobservable market data by correlation or other means; and \nโข  Level 3 -Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires \nmanagement to develop its own assumptions. \nThe asset's or liability's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of \ninput that is significant to their fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the \nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. \nThe foJlowing is a description of the valuation techniques used for assets measured at fair value: \nโข  Money market funds- Valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Valuation is from an \nunadjusted quoted price; \nโข  Repurchase agreements-Valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Valuation is not \nobtained from a quoted price in an active market; \nโข  Corporate stocks/exchange traded funds -Valued at the closing price reported in an active \nmarket in which the securities are traded; and \nโข  Mutual funds-equity andf ixed income securities - Valued at the net asset value (''NAV  \") of \nshares held and is calculated at the end of each business day; \nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net \nrealizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while NEA believes its valuation \nmethods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different \nmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in \na different fair value measurement at the reporting date. \n-24-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 170 of 211   Page ID #:189\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nThe fo1lowing table presents NEA's fair value hierarchy for financial assets measured on a recurring \nbasis at August 31, 2011: \nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using \nQuoted Prices  Significant \nin Active  Other  SigoifJCant \nMarkets for  Observable  Unobservable \nIdentical Assets  Inputs  Inputs \n(Levell)  (Level2)  (Level 3)  Total ยท .ยท ยท._.  ยท  :ยท:. ;~: . \nMoney Market Funds  $  5,559,795  $  $  $  5,559,795 \nRepurchase Agreements  12,367,168  12,367,168 \nExchange Traded Funds \nMutual Funds-Equity securities \nGrowth funds  4,469,089  4,469,089 \nValue funds  4,472,521  4,472,521 \nBlend fund  2,829,590  2,829,590 \nMutual Funds - Fixed income securities \nU.S fixed income fund  16,416,809  16,416,809 \nInternational fDted income fund  1,531,135  1,531,135 \n$  35,278.939  $  12,367,168  $  $ 47,646,107 \n-25-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 171 of 211   Page ID #:190\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nAND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nAS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 AND 2010 \nThe following table presents NEA 's fair value hierarchy for financial assets measured on a recurring \nbasis at August 31,2010: \nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using \nQuoted Prices  SignifiCant \nin Active  Other  Significant \nMarkets for  Observable  Unobservable \nIdentical Assets  Inputs  Inputs \n(Level I)  (Level2)  (Level3)  Total \nMoney Market Funds  $  10,157,896  $  $  $  10,157,896 \nRepurchase Agreements  17,279,738  17,279,738 \nCorporate Stocks \nEnergy  553,030  553,030 \nIndustrial  633,901  633,901 \nConsumer  1,102,515  I ,102,515 \nHealth care  731,891  731,891 \nFinancials  798,956  798,956 \nlnfonnation technology  824,046  824,046 \nOther  842,706  842,706 \nExchange Traded Funds  1,509,186  1,509,186 \nMutual Funds - Equity securit;es \nGrowth funds  2,526,338  2,526,338 \nValue funds  763,220  763,220 \nB1end fimd  892,590  892,590 \nMutual Funds - Fixed income securities \nU.S fiXed income fund  8,829,362  8,829,362 \n$  30,165,637  $  17,279,738  $  $ 47,445,375 \n17.

AGENCY FEE CHARGEABLE AND NONCHARGEABLE EXPENDITURES \nThe National Education Association (NEA) collects agency or service fees from non-members of \nNEA.  These non-members are referred to as \"agency feepayers.\" NEA is required by law to have \nprocedures in effect to determine the amount of its expenditures that can be charged to objecting \nagency feepayers. The procedures that NEA applies have received the approval of arbitrators, public \nsector labor boards, and courts. The legal interpretations and standards that NEA currently utilizes to \nmake its determinations of chargeability have  been developed by the NEA\"s Office of General \nCounsel based on relevant case law. \nNEA has analyzed its expenditures and detennined which of those expenditures were \"chargeable\" to \nobjecting agency feepayers and which of them were \"nonchargeable\" to those agency feepayers. \nBased on relevant federal and state judicial and administrative decisions, it was determined that \nchargeable activities and expenditures were related to the following matters: \n1.  collective bargaining; \n2.  preparations for strikes, and activities undertaken in connection with lawful strikes; \n3.  contract administration; \n4.  grievance processing, including arbitration; \n5.  specific terms and conditions of employment that may be negotiable, such as wages, hours, \nbenefits, working conditions, employment discrimination, promotions, discipline, discharge, \nretirement benefits, perfonnance evaluation, overtime compensation, environmental issues \nin the workplace, etc.; \n6.  communications with bargaining unit members regarding services they receive; \n7.  professional development (including teacher education, continuing education, and \ncertification), curriculum development and implementation, teaching methods and other \ninstructional skills, information and materials intended for instructional purposes, site-based \ndecision making, and education generally, except to the extent that such activities and \nexpenditures involve lobbying and other political activities, membership organizing or \nrecruitment activities, and/or external public relations; \n8.  uses of technology in education; \n9.  publications, portions of publications, or any other communications which involve \nchargeable issues, such as those related to activities or expenditures listed herein as \nchargeable, if the publications are provided to agency feepayers; \n10.  unemployment and job opportunities in education; \n11.  insurance programs and other benefits for which both members and agency feepayers are \neligible; \n-41-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 187 of 211   Page ID #:206\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nNOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMARY SCHEDULES OF AGENCY FEE \nCHARGEABLE AND NONCHARGEABLE EXPENDITURES \nYEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2011 \n12.  NEA award programs; \n13.  Association leadership and management skills training and techniques, strategic planning; \n14.

STATE AFFILIATE DETERMINATION OF CHARGEABLE EXPENDITURES \nThe total  chargeable and nonchargeable  expenditures included in the Affiliate  Financial \nAssistance  Program  (category  2  of  Affiliate  programs  and  services  that  increase \nmembership), Small States Foundation Program, Unified State Executive Director Program, \nLocal Presidents Release Time Program, and UniServ Grants Program (all in category 1 of \nAffiliate programs and services that increase membership), and in the Unified Legal Services \nProgram (category 4 of Student learning and workforce quality), have been allocated based \non a  conservative estimate of the  average  chargeable percentages  reported by the  state \naffiliates for the year ended August 31, 201 0. That is because, at the time of this audit, state \naffiliates have not yet completed their own audits for the year ended August 31, 2011. State \naffiliates will subsequently report their respective chargeable and nonchargeable percentages \nfor the year ended August 31, 2011, when complete, audited infonnation is available for \nthem  to  make  such  determinations.  Therefore,  the  chargeable  and  nonchargeable \nexpenditures of those programs listed in this document are estimates for purposes of these \nschedules and will subsequently be adjusted to actual upon receipt of the chargeable and \nnonchargeable percentages from state affiliates. \nThe expenditures in category 4 of Student learning and workforce quality include amounts \nfor Educators Employment Liability (EEL) insurance and the Attorney Referral Program \n(ARP), which are not provided to agency feepayers in some states.  For purposes of this \npresentation, the EEL-related expenditures have been treated as chargeable and the ARP \nrelated expenditures have been treated as nonchargeable; however, in the states where either \nthe EEL insurance or ARP is not provided to agency feepayers, the expenditures will be \nconsidered nonchargeable. \n3. OVERHEAD FUNCTIONS \nThe  expenditures  in  the  following  Core  Service  Areas  and  Strategic  Goals  are  considered \nprogrammatic  in  nature:  Tax  and  economic  policies and school  funding;  Improved  education \nmembers' salaries; Making priority schools great public schools for all students; Student learning and \nworkforce quality; Affiliate programs and services that increase membership; categories 1, 2, 4 and \nportions of category 3 of Advocate and communicate for public education; Develop and sustain \nstrategic  partnerships;  and  portions  of categories  I,  4,  7, and  9,  of Business  and  governance \noperations. \nThe expenditures in the following Core Service Areas are considered support or overhead:  portions \nof category 3 of Advocate and communicate for public education; category 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 and \nportions of categories  1, 4,  7,  and 9 of Business and governance  operations.  In view of this \nrelationship, management believes it is fair and reasonable to allocate the expenditures in the support \nor overhead areas by the percentage determined as chargeable for the programmatic activities, but \nonly after specific clearly chargeable or clearly nonchargeable expenditures have been separated and \ntreated as fully chargeable or nonchargeable, respectively. \n-44-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 190 of 211   Page ID #:209\nNATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES \nNOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMARY SCHEDULES OF AGENCY FEE \nCHARGEABLE AND NONCHARGEABLE EXPENDITURES \nYEAR ENDED AUGUST 31,2011 \nThe support or overhead expenditures, which are considered clearly chargeable, are as follows: \nCore Service Area 3 -Advocate and communicate for public education \n3.

Because, as explained in Note 2, the chargeable percentages for \nsome programmatic activities will vary from state to state in accordance with certain specific \nexpenditures of those state affiliates, the chargeable and nonchargeable expenditures of those \nremaining support or overhead  areas  are  not  final.  Once NEA receives  the appropriate \ninformation from the state affiliates, it will calculate a final chargeable programmatic activity \npercentage for each state affiliate and then use that percentage to allocate the expenditures in \nthe remaining support or overhead areas.  Consequently,  new NEA  total  chargeable and \nnonchargeable expenditures will result for each state affiliate. \n***** \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 192 of 211   Page ID #:211\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit E \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 193 of 211   Page ID #:212\nnea \nNATIONAL \n1201 16th St., N.

Ferris Faculty Ass'n, 500 \nU.S. 507 (1991), and Locke v. Karass, 555 U.S. 207 (2009), which recognized that \"part of a \nlocal's affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of resources potentially available to the \nlocal is assessed for the bargaining unit's protection, even if it is not actually expended on \nthat unit in any particular membership year,\" NEA has allocated its Unified Legal Services \nProgram (\"ULSP\") reimbursements, Tactic 4.14, on the basis of the California Teachers \nAssociation's (\"CTACTA's\") determination of the chargeable percentage of the \nreimbursements it received in the 2010-2011 fiscal year (20.60%). Thus, the resulting \nULSP chargeable amount is $5,153,282. This figure differs from the ULSP chargeable \namount used for purposes of the chargeable/ nonchargeable schedule included in the NEA \naudit, $17,761,312, because the amount in the audit was based upon a conservative \nadjustment of the average chargeable percentage ofULSP reimbursements to agency fee \nstate affiliates for the year ended August 31, 2010. That percentage was 71%. NEA used \nthis method because, at the time its audit was conducted, most of those state affiliates had \nnot yet determined their fiscal year 2010-2011 chargeable percentages. In addition, for \npurposes of the NEA audit, Educators Employment Liability (EEL) insurance expenditures \nTactic 4.13, were treated as chargeable. However, CTA does not make EEL coverage \navailable to agency feepayers, and therefore all such expenditures ($10,683,952) have been \ntreated as nonchargeable with regard to CTA.  Thus, the resulting chargeable total for \nCategory 4 of Student Learning and Workforce Quality is $11,860,961, as compared with \n$35,152,943 in the NEA audit \nIn light of the decisions in Lehnert and Locke, see note i, NEA has allocated its \nii \nUniServ grants program expenditures, part of Tactic 1.2, on the basis of the CTA's \ndetermination of the chargeable percentage of the grants it received in the 2010-2011 \nfiscal year (94.50%). Thus, the resulting UniServ chargeable amount is $63,168,639, rather \nthan $58,823,706 that was used for purposes of the NEA audit. The reason for the \ndifference between the new figure for this program and its counterpart in the NEA audit is \nthat, at the time the audit was conducted, most of the agency fee state affiliates had not yet \ndetermined their fiscal year 2010-2011 chargeable percentages. Accordingly, for purposes \nof the audit, the expenditures in the UniServ grants program were aJlocated using a \nconservative adjustment of the average chargeable percentage ofUniServ grants to agency \nfee state affiliates for the year ended August 31, 2010 (88%). \nIn addition, NEA has al1ocated its expenditures in the SmaH States Foundation \nProgram, part of Tactic 1.2, in accordance with CTA's determination of the overall \nchargeable percentage of its total expenditures for the 2010-2011 fiscal year (68.40%), \nresulting in a chargeable amount of $1,991,192, rather than $2,183,325 that was used for \npurposes of the NEA audit The reason for the difference between the new figure for this \n-17-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 210 of 211   Page ID #:229\nprogram and its counterpart in the NEA audit is that, at the time the audit was conducted, \nmost of the agency fee state affiliates had not yet determined their fiscal year 2010-2011 \nchargeable percentages. Accordingly, for purposes of the audit, the expenditures in the \nSmall States Foundation program were allocated using a conservative adjustment of the \naverage chargeable percentage of agency fee state affiliates' total expenditures for the year \nended August31, 2010 (75%). \nSimilarly, NEA allocated its expenditures in the Unified State Executive Director \nProgram (\"USEDP\"), part ofTactic 1.2, in accordance with CTA's determination of the \nchargeable percentage of its executive director's salary and benefits for the 2010-2011 \nfiscal year (68.40%), resulting in a chargeable amount of$646,122, as compared with \n$689,575 that was used for purposes of the NEA audit Again, the reason for the difference \nbetween the new figure and its counterpart in the NEA audit is that, at the time the audit \nwas conducted, most of the agency fee state affiliates had not yet determined their fiscal \nyear 2010-2011 percentages. Accordingly, for purposes of the audit, the expenditures in \nthe USEDP were allocated using a conservative adjustment of the average chargeable \npercentage of expenditures for the salary and benefits of agency fee state affiliate executive \ndirectors for the year ended August 31, 2010 (73%). \nFinally, since the agency fee locals affiliated with CTA have aJlocated their 2010-11 \nexpenditures into chargeable and nonchargeable categories, NEA is allocating its \nexpenditures in the Local Presidents Release Program, part of Tactic 1.2, by the average \nchargeable percentage (80.00%) reported by those locals, resulting in a chargeable amount \nof$389,892, as compared with $385,018 that was used for purposes of the NEA audit. The \nreason for the difference between the new figure for this program and its counterpart in \nthe NEA audit is that, at the time the audit was conducted, most of the agency fee affiliates \nhad not yet determined their fiscal year 2010-2011 chargeable percentages. Accordingly, \nfor purposes of the audit, the expenditures in the Local Presidents Release Program were \nallocated using a conservative adjustment of the average chargeable percentage of agency \nfee local affiliates' total expenditures for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010 (79%). \nAs a result of these modifications to the allocation of expenditures in the UniServ \ngrants, Small States Foundation, USEDP, and Local Presidents Release Programs, the total \nchargeable amount for Category 1 of Affiliate Programs and Services that Increase \nMembership is $69,697,074, as compared with $65,582,853 in the NEA audit. \nm In light of the decisions in Lehnert and Locke, see note i, NEA has allocated its \nexpenditures in the Affiliate Financial Assistance Program, Tactic 2.1, in accordance with \nCTA's determination of the overall chargeable percentage of its total expenditures for the \n2010-11 fiscal year (68.40%), resulting in a chargeable amount of$1,181,999, rather than \nthe amount of $1,296,052 that was used for purposes of the NEA audit. The reason for the \ndifference between the new figure for this program and its counterpart in the NEA audit is \nthat, at the time the audit was conducted, most of the agency fee state affiliates had not yet \ndetermined their fiscal year 2010-2011 chargeable percentages. Accordingly, for purposes \n-18-\n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JST-CW   Document 1   Filed 04/30/13   Page 211 of 211   Page ID #:230\nof the audit, the expenditures in the Affiliate Financial Assistance Program were allocated \nusing a conservative adjustment of the average chargeable percentage of agency fee state \naffiliates' total expenditures for the year ended August 31, 2010 (75%). As a result of these \nmodifications to the aJiocation of expenditures in the Affiliate Financial Assistance \nProgram, the total chargeable amount for Category 2 of Affiliate Programs and Services that \nIncrease Membership is $1,181,999, as compared with $1,296,052 in the NEA audit \nlv As a result of the adjustments in the programmatic activities, see notes i through \niii, the Programmatic Activity Chargeable Percentage is 40.48% as compared with 48.5% \nthat was in the NEA audit Therefore, for purposes ofthese calculations, the figure 40.48% \nwas used to allocate certain expenditures in the Support/Overhead activities in accordance \nwith the procedure discussed in footnote 3 on pages 44-46 of the NEA audit \n-19-",

(Mot., Doc. 81, โMotionโ.)  Defendants \nfiled an opposition, and Plaintiffs replied.  (Def. Oppโn, Doc. 90; Reply, Doc. 91.)  \nFollowing an order of certification made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n5.1(b) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 2403(b), the Government intervened and, on November 25, 2013, \nfiled a response to the Motion.

Having \nreviewed the papers and taken the matter under submission, the Court GRANTS \nPlaintiffsโ Motion and enters judgment on the pleadings in favor of Defendants.  \nPlaintiffsโ pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction is VACATED as moot.  (Doc. 71.)1 \nI.  Background \nUnder California law, a union is allowed to become the exclusive bargaining \nrepresentative for public school employees in a bargaining unit such as a public school \ndistrict by submitting proof that a majority of employees in the unit wish to be \nrepresented by the union.  Cal. Govโt. Code ยง 3544(a).

This โagency feeโ is usually the same amount as \nthe union dues.  (Compl., Doc. 1 ยถ 52.)2 \nCalifornia law limits the use of agency fees to activities โgermaneโ to collective \nbargaining.  Id. ยง 3546(b).  Each year, unions must estimate the portion of expenses that \ndo not fall into this category for the coming year, based on the non-chargeable portion of \na recent yearโs fee.  Regs. of Cal. Pub. Empโt. Relations Bd. ยง 32992(b)(1).  After the \nunion has made this determination, it must send a notice to all non-members setting forth \nboth the agency fee and the non-chargeable portions of the fee.  Cal. Govโt. Code ยง \n3546(a); Regs. of Cal. Pub. Empโt Relations Bd. ยง 32992(a).  If non-members do not \nwish to pay the non-chargeable portions of the feeโi.e., the portions of the fee going to \nactivities not โgermaneโ to collective bargainingโthey must notify the union after \nreceipt of the notice.

(Id. ยถยถ 22-23, 34-\n44.) \nPlaintiffs claim that โ[b]y requiring Plaintiffs to make any financial contributions \nin support of any union, Californiaโs agency shop arrangement violates their rights to free \nspeech and association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution,โ and that โ[b]y requiring Plaintiffs to undergo โopt outโ procedures to avoid \n                                                 \n2 When ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court accepts as true the factual \nallegations in the complaint.  Fleming v. Pickard, 581 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir. 2009).   \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n                                                  CIVIL MINUTES โ GENERAL                                               2 \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JLS-CW   Document 106   Filed 12/05/13   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:2739\nJS-6\n__________________________________________________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES โ GENERAL \n \nCase No. SACV 13-676-JLS (CWx)   Date: December 5, 2013 \nTitle: Rebecca Friedrichs, et al. v. California Teachers Assโn, et al. \nmaking financial contributions in support of โnon-chargeableโ union expenditures, \nCaliforniaโs agency-shop arrangement violates their rights to free speech and association \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.โ  \n(Id. ยถยถ 89, 92.) \nPlaintiffs move for judgment on the pleadings, but in Defendantsโ favor.  Although \nPlaintiffs are not clear on whether they are asking the Court to grant or deny their \nMotion, Plaintiffs are clear that they are asking the Court to enter judgment in favor of \nDefendants.  (Compare Mot. at 1 (โPlaintiffs concede that this Court should deny their \nMotion and, instead, grant judgment on the pleadings to Defendantsโ (emphasis \nremoved)) with Proposed Order, Doc. 81-1 at 1 (requesting that the Motion be \nโGRANTED in favor of Defendants.โ).)  Accordingly, the Court construes the Motion \nsuch that granting the Motion would allow judgment to be entered in favor of \nDefendants.   \nII.  Legal Standard \nโAfter the pleadings are closedโbut early enough not to delay trialโa party may \nmove for judgment on the pleadings.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  Motions for judgment on \nthe pleadings are governed by the same standards applicable to Rule 12(b)(6) motions to \ndismiss.  Cafasso v. General Dynamics C4 Systems, 637 F.3d 1047, 1054, n. 4 (9th Cir. \n2011).  The Court โmust accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and \nconstrue them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.โ  Fleming v. Pickard, \n581 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir. 2009).  โJudgment on the pleadings is proper when the \nmoving party clearly establishes on the face of the pleadings that no material issue of fact \nremains to be resolved and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  Hal Roach \nStudios v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1989). \nIII.  Discussion \nPlaintiffs urge the Court to enter judgment on the pleadings in favor of \nDefendants, contending that Plaintiffsโ claims are โpresently foreclosed byโ Abood v. \nDetroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977) and Mitchell v. Los Angeles Unified \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n                                                  CIVIL MINUTES โ GENERAL                                               3 \n\nCase 8:13-cv-00676-JLS-CW   Document 106   Filed 12/05/13   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:2740\nJS-6\n__________________________________________________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n \nCIVIL MINUTES โ GENERAL \n \nCase No. SACV 13-676-JLS (CWx)   Date: December 5, 2013 \nTitle: Rebecca Friedrichs, et al. v. California Teachers Assโn, et al. \nSchool District, 963 F.2d 258 (9th Cir. 1992).  (Mot. at 2.)3  In Abood, the Supreme Court \nupheld the constitutional validity of compelling employees to support a particular \ncollective bargaining representative and rejected the notion that the only funds from \nnonunion members that a union constitutionally could use for political or ideological \ncauses were those funds that the nonunion members affirmatively consented to pay.  431 \nU.S. at 222, 225,235-36.  The Mitchell court, following Abood, held that the First \nAmendment did not require an โopt inโ procedure for nonunion members to pay fees \nequal to the full amount of union dues under an agency shop arrangement.  See 963 F.2d \nat 260-62 (citing and discussing the โlong line of Supreme Court casesโ that support the \nconstitutional validity of an opt-out system based on a nonmemberโs expressed \nobjection).  The parties do not dispute that Abood and Mitchell foreclose Plaintiffsโ \nclaims, and the Court agrees that these decisions are controlling.  (See Mot. at 2; Def. \nOppโn at 14; Govโt Oppโn at 4-5, 9.)  \nAccordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffsโ Motion and enters judgment on the \npleadings in favor of Defendants. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffsโ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is \nGRANTED.  Judgment is entered in favor of Defendants.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction is VACATED as moot.   \n \n \n \nInitials of Preparer:  tg \n \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffsโ ultimate aimโand thus their request for judgment on the pleadings in favor of \nDefendantsโis to have these precedents overturned on appeal.  (See Mot. at 9; see also Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, Doc. 71 at 1.) \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n                                                  CIVIL MINUTES โ GENERAL                                               4 ",
