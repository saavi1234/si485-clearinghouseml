    "summary": "<p>On May 30, 1979, Robert Burlington, a pre-trial detainee at St. Louis County Jail in Clayton, Missouri, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against St. Louis County officials regarding conditions at the jail.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of all pre-trial detainees at the St. Louis County Jail.  Burlington filed the lawsuit pro se.  </p><p>In 1980, this case was consolidated with a previous lawsuit filed in 1976.  That lawsuit, Johnson v. O'Brien, resulted in a December 30, 1977, order by District Judge John Nangle.  Johnson v. O'Brien, 445 F. Supp. 122 (E.D. Mo. 1977). Judge Nangle ordered St. Louis County to complete renovations and alterations of the jail within one year from the date of the order.  These renovations were to result in larger living areas for inmates.  The district court also enjoined the number of inmates who could be housed at the jail prior to the renovations.  The court ordered the jail to improve medical care, conduct a daily medical survey of inmates, allow inmates to clean their living areas and launder their clothes, and allow regular visitation.  Judge Nangle's 1980 consolidation of the two cases aimed to determine the defendants' compliance with the 1977 order.  </p><p>Mr. Burlington's initial pleading was a petition for temporary injunction.  He claimed that jail officials were violating his First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights by not allowing him access to periodicals he received in the mail.  In August 1979, other inmates petitioned the court to participate in the lawsuit and claimed numerous other constitutional violations, including overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, lack of recreation, denial of visitation rights, and inadequate medical care.  An amended complaint was filed after the plaintiffs obtained representation by private attorneys, incorporating many of the inmates' claims.  In February 1980, the district court approved the case as a class action, adopting a January 10, 1980, recommendation to that effect by U.S. Magistrate David D. Noce.  Magistrate Judge Williams S. Bahn conducted a review of jail conditions, including a personal visit to the jail, and stated in an unpublished July 1980, order that he had determined that, in most areas, the jail was in compliance with the previous order.  There was overcrowding and the facility lacked a proper library, however.  </p><p>The parties subsequently came to agreement on many of the issues in the complaints.  Their stipulation, dated August 12, 1983, reaffirmed the Johnson v. O'Brien order and set out the defendants' agreement to implement population limits, provide additional material in the law library, cease conducting strip searches in connection with visitation privileges, and segregate pre-trial detainees under the age of sixteen years.  Judge Nangle ordered the stipulation posted in the jail.  Litigation continued concerning attorneys' fees, with the two appointed counsel for plaintiffs receiving fee awards of $25,000 and $12,500, respectively, pursuant to Judge Nangle's November 29, 1983, unpublished order.  </p><p>On August 2, 1993, due to flooding at another jail and the subsequent transfer of inmates to the St. Louis County Jail, the district court temporarily lifted the population limits in the jail.  This emergency order was terminated on March 29, 1994, upon the defendants' request, by an unpublished order by District Judge Edward L. Filippine.  The docket does not indicate any further litigation in this case.</p><p></p>",

A\nROBERT E.  BULLINGTON,  et  a l .,  )  «-\\\n)\nPlaintiffs,  )\nv.  )  No.  79-650 C LA)\nGENE McNARY, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendants.  )\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nOF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE\nThe class action allegations of plaintiffs' amended\ncomplaint were referred to the undersigned United States\nMagistrate for review and a recommended disposition pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. §636 (b) .\nPlaintiffs Robert E. Bullington, Steven L. Toney,\nGlen Reynolds and Michael Clark seek an order permitting them\nto maintain this action as a class action on behalf of all\npersons who are detained at the St. Louis County Jail who are\nawaiting trial on alleged criminal offenses against the State\nof Missouri. By their allegations they invoke Rule 23 (a),\n(b)(1)(B), and (b)(2). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The\nmatter came on for hearing on January 9, 1980 and the parties,\nby counsel, offered written and oral stipulations of fact.\nAfter considering the allegations of the complaint\nand the stipulations of counsel the undersigned makes the\nfollowing findings:\nThe class is so numerous that joinder of all members\nis impracticable, there being in excess of 50 pre-trial detainees\ncurrently incarcerated in the St. Louis County Jail.  One of the\nJohnson v. O'Brien\nT\nJC-MO-010-030\n\npurported class representatives, Robert E. Bullington, remains\nincarcerated as a pre-trial detainee at the St. Louis County\nJail.  There are questions of fact and law common to the class.\nThe claims of the representatives of the class are typical of\nthe claims of the class.  The representative parties  through\ntheir counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.  See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 23(a).  The prosecution of\nseparate actions by or against individual members of the class\nwould  create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class which would as a practical matter be\ndispositive of the interests of the other members not parties\nto the adjudications or substantially impede or impair their\nability to protect their interests.  See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 23(b)(l)(B)\nThe parties opposing the class have acted or refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding  declaratory\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole.  See Fed.R.Civ.Pro.\n23(b) (2) .\nRECOMMENDATION\nFor the reasons set out above, it is the  recommendation\nof the undersigned United States Magistrate that\n(1) this action be maintained as a class action\npursuant to Rule 23(a),  (b)(1), and  (b)(2);\n(2) the subject class be defined as all persons\nwho are detained, or have been detained, or will be detained at\nthe St. Louis County Jail, State of Missouri, awaiting  trial\non alleged offenses against the State of Missouri;\n(3) the Court reserve  the right to alter or eliminate\nthe class aspects of this action or to impose further conditions\nto its maintenance as a class action if upon further hearings\n-2-\n\nand upon further evidence adduced this Court believes that\nsuch alteration, elimination or conditions are necessary in\norder to properly protect the interests of the class.  See\nFed.R.Civ.Pro. 23(c)(l).  The parties shall have ten days\nwithin which to file written objections to this Report and\nRecommendation.\nRespectfully submitted,\n.GISTRATE\nWday\nDated this 1980.\n-3-\n\n1\nJi»hrteB ^OtBtrtei Court\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nOFFICE OF THE CLERK\n1114  MARKET STREET PHONE:\njSatnt flams, ^Missouri 63101 COML  314-4254315\nEYVON MENDENHALL FTS  279-4315\nSeptember  18,  1980\nMr. James L.

DISTRICT  OF r-,1C.\nROBERT ERNEST  BULLINGTON,  et  al.  )\nPlaintiffs,  )\n(/) (U J)\nvs.  )  Cause No. 79-650 C\nWARDEN MORELAND, et al.  )\nDefendants.  )\nBRIEF OF DEFENDANTS IN SUPPORT\nOF DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT\nPlaintiffs in their first Amended Complaint are attempting\nto relitigate the issues of law and fact previously brought before\nthis Court regarding policies, conditions and facilities of the\nSt.  Louis County, Missouri  Jail in Clayton, Missouri. Further,\nPlaintiffs have prayed for relief from said policies and conditions\nwhich this Court has already investigated and entered judgment.\nThis Court in the Case of Ronnie Johnson, et al. v.\nWilliam O'Brien, et al., Cause No. 76-210 C (3), Appeal dismissed\nin 78-1143, caused the facilities and policies extant at the\nClayton portion of the St. Louis County Jail to be exhaustively\ninvestigated by Magistrate William S. Bahn as Special Master.\nAt the conclusion of said investigation, the parties entered\ninto a stipulation and judgment was entered wherein St. Louis\nCounty was required to comply with said judgment and make progress\nreports on a periodic basis to the Court to ensure compliance.\nThe same issues and factual allegations are again raised in\nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint.  The Court ordered renovation of\nsaid facilities continues under this Court's supervision pursuant\nto the judgment in Johnson v. O'Brien supra.\nPlaintiffs' Complaint is an attempt to sue upon the\ncause of action adjudicated in Johnson supra., as the same parties\nand issues were previously joined and ruled upon thus constituting\nres judicata as to those issues and parties.  See Commissioner\nv. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597 (1948).

      "text": "f\nF I L ED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nEASTERN DIVISION SEP 18  1980\nEVVON MEMDENHALL\nU, S. .©(STRICT COURT\n£. ^DISTRICT OF MO.\nROBERT E. BULLINGTON,\net al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nvs. No.  79 - 650 C (2)\nWARDEN MORELAND, et al..\n)\nDefendants. ) Johnson v. O'Brien\nMEMORANDUM JC-MO-010-038\nThis case is now before the Court on defendants'\nT\nmotion for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs brought this\nsuit on behalf of all pre-trial detainees incarcerated in\nthe St. Louis County Jail, attacking almost every aspect\nof the jail administration.  Plaintiffs seek extensive\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys'\nfees and costs.  This suit is closely related to the prior\nsuit of Johnson v. O'Brien, No. 76 - 210 C (3) (E.D. Mo.),\nin which this Court ordered compliance by officials of the\nSt. Louis County Jail with certain constitutional minima\nregarding recreation, medical care, and laundry, as well as\nother aspects of the jail administration.  See 445 F.Supp.\n122 (E.D.Mo. 1977).  The instant suit challenges some of\nthese same aspects.  Several of the plaintiffs in this case\nhave also written this Court seeking to have defendants in\nT Johnson held in contempt due to their alleged failure to\ncomply with this Court's Orders in that case.\n\nIt is clear that the instant case can not be resolved\nvia the instant motion for summary judgment.  Rather than\nthere being no issue of material fact in dispute, the\nmaterials submitted with this motion illustrate that nearly\nevery fact is in dispute.  In support of the instant motion,\ndefendants submit the affidavit of the Director of Justice\nServices for St. Louis County, Missouri, which incorporates\nnumerous reports and documents submitted in response to\nplaintiffs' complaint.  These materials controvert nearly\nevery allegation of plaintiffs' complaint, and set forth\ndefendants' version of the practices and procedures followed\nat the Jail.\nPlaintiffs have not responded to this motion as such.\nRather, in a pre-trial conference, plaintiffs' attorney\nindicated that plaintiffs would rest on their verified\ncomplaint.  In responding to defendants' motion for summary\njudgment, this verified complaint is the equivalent of oppos-\ning affidavits.  Runnels v. Rosendale, 499 F.2d 733 (9th Cir.\n1974); Forts v. Malcolm, 426 F.Supp. 464 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).\nIt is therefore clear that there are substantial factual\ndisputes which preclude the granting of the instant motion for\nsummary judgment.\nThe law in this area is not overly complicated.  The\nSupreme Court has recently set out the standards to be applied\nin reviewing the conditions under which pre-trial detainees\nare incarcerated.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  The\nEighth Circuit has applied these standards in the recent case\n2.\n\nof Campbell v. Cauthron, No. 78-1838 (May 29, 1980).  These\nstandards may not be applied, however, until the numerous\nfactual disputes are resolved.\nTo resolve these disputes, this case will be referred\nto the Honorable William S. Bahn, United States Magistrate,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §636(b) (1) (B).  Magistrate Bahn is\nthoroughly familiar with the situation at the St. Louis\nCounty Jail, as he played an active role in the resolution\nof the Johnson case.  Furthermore, the Johnson case will be\nreopened and consolidated with this one.  In the course of\nthe proceedings in this case, Magistrate Bahn should review\ndefendants' compliance with this Court's Orders in Johnson.\nT\nMr. John Emde, who ably represented the plaintiffs in\nJohnson will be appointed as plaintiffs' co-counsel in this\ncase.\nMagistrate Bahn should conduct whatever proceedings he\ndeems necessary to resolve the factual conflicts in this\ncase.  He may find it advisable, for example, to inspect the\njail facility himself to determine the adequacy of the\nphysical plant.  Upon conclusion of any necessary proceedings,\nMagistrate Bahn should submit detailed proposed findings of\nfact and recommendations for disposition of this case.  The\nparties will then be given the appropriate opportunity to\ncomment or object, and this Court will make its de novo determin-\nation, as required by 28 U.S.C. §636 (b).\nThough this Court does not expect Magistrate Bahn to\ngive this case top priority on his docket, he should attempt\n3.\n\nT\nto conclude the necessary proceedings as soon as possible.\nIf the conditions under which plaintiffs are incarcerated\nare in fact unconstitutional, they should not have to put\nup with those conditions longer than necessary.\nDated:  September 18, 1980.\nT\n4.\nTTl",

Weyerich, Assistant County Counselor, 11 South\nMeramec Avenue, Clayton, Missouri  63105, and to John P. Emde, 611\nOlive Street, Suite 1950, St. Louis, Missouri  63101, this 30th day of\nDecember, 1980.\nT\nL^^--''TThomas\n\nUNSANITARY AND UNSAFE CONDITIONS\n11.  The cells are infested with roaches and mice.  There is\nalso a fungus which frequently grows on some walls of the jail\nduring periods of high humidity and heat.  Whenever this fungus is\npresent, there is an increase of respiratory ailments among the\ninmates.\n12.  Windows in the jail vary in their condition.  In 1975, a\nmajority of the windows were blocked up and air conditioning units\ninstalled.  The exhaust vents on the roof provide the only source\nof ventilation in the cell areas.  This lack of ventilation causes\nfoul odors to collect and constantly permeate the air.\n13.  The mattresses for the bunks are filthy, foul-smelling\nand never cleaned, aired out, or disinfected.  No mattress covers\nare furnished, and there is often a long period of time between\nchanging of sheets.\n14.  The only cleaning in the jail is done by the inmates.\nInmates who are trustees are responsible for the halls and common\nareas, while all inmates are solely responsible for their cells.\nT\nInmates who are not trustees frequently have difficulty obtaining\nthe proper cleaning tools, such as mops and brooms.\n15.  Showers and open toilet areas are contained in each cell,\nexcept for the women's cell that has a separate enclosed bathroom.\nThe only cleaning of these areas is done by the inmates occupying\nthe individual cells, who are seldom provided with the proper\nmaterials to adequately clean these areas.  Consequently these areas\nare breeding grounds for bacteria and fungus.\n16.  Inmates are required to eat their meals in their cells,\nwhich are usually in a dirty and unsanitary condition due to the\nlimited amount of cleaning previously described.\n17.  There is insufficient hot water for inmates to take showers.\nNormally an inmate must shower in cold water or remain dirty.\n18.  Personal hygiene items such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste,\ntoothbrushes, and  combs, are sometimes difficult to obtain.  No\nrazors are given to any inmates, except during sporadic times when\ngroups of inmates are allowed to shave in one cell.\n\n19.  Laundry is supposed to be done once a week for all inmates\nby the trustees.  However, because of breakdowns in the equipment,\nT\nwashing is often done only once a month.  Also, inmates must wash\ntheir own socks in the sink without any detergent.\n20.  There are heating and cooling problems, causing the jail\nto be unreasonably cold in the winter and unreasonably hot in the\nsummer.  At all times, the temperature varies from floor to floor.\nInmates often suffer the harsh physiological effects of temperature\nextremes.\nT\nT\n\nFOOD\n22.  The food served to the inmates is nutritionally deficient.\nFood which is supposed to be hot is always cold.  Inmates never\nreceive fresh fruits or vegetables.  The portions of food which\ninmates do receive are too small, leaving inmates still hungry\nimmediately after eating a meal.\nT\n\nMEDICAL FACILITIES AND CARE\n23.  An inmate needing medical attention or medication from\n5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. must request it by getting a written or oral\nmessage to a correctional officer.  These officers have no procedure\nfor routinely checking with inmates to see who needs medical atten-\ntion, and they do not in fact do so.  Even when officers receive\nrequests for medical attention, these messages may not be transmitted\npromptly to the medical staff, and they may not be conveyed to the\nmedical staff at all.  Therefore, inmates must sometimes endure\nunreasonable delay in obtaining needed care.  For \"minor\" problems,\nsuch as colds, sores, dandruff, insect bites, rashes, corns,\nathlete's foot, headaches and toothaches, it is very difficult to\nget any relief, even an aspirin.\n24.  When medical requests are made, the officer decides if\nthe inmate receives medical attention.  The officer has no special-\nized training to diagnosis or to determine if medical assistance is\nrequired.  Therefore, the decision to allow medical assistance is\nT\noften at the whim of the officer.\n25.  There is no medical screening procedure to test for con-\ntagious diseases.  Trustees who handle all food preparation tasks\ndo receive a limited amount of screening for certain diseases.\nHowever, this screening frequently does not take place until the\ninmate has been on the job for a number of weeks, thus rendering\nthese tfests meaningless, exposing other inmates to great harm.\n26.  No dental care is provided.\n\nVISITATION AND COMMUNICATION RIGHTS\nT 27.  The visiting facilities are grossly inadequate.  The\nvisitation area consists of a \"fish-bowl\" area where visitors enter.\nInmates are viewed through glass-like panels which are the walls\nof the \"fish-bowl\".  If more than two or three persons occupy this\narea, it becomes very crowded.  Inmates with visitors must stand\non the outside of the \"fish-bowl\" and communicate with their visitors\nthrough a hole.  They are difficult for effective and meaningful\ncommunication.  There is only one visit allowed per week.  Each\ninmate is allotted one hour per week for visitation, with a limit\nof two visitors.\n28.  Inmates are allowed an initial phone call upon admittance\nand are thereafter allowed to make one call per  week.  According\nto the whims of some guards, certain inmates are permitted to make\nmore calls, while some have their weekly call delayed until the\nvery end of the week.  Inmates are only allowed to speak to the\nperson called for a period of ten minutes.  The calls take place\nin an office, with a social worker or officer present, depriving\nthem of any privacy.  If an inmate uses this call to speak with\nhis attorney, he is denied the confidentiality of the attorney-\nclient relationship.\n\nJAIL DISCIPLINE\nT\n29.  The only written rules and regulations issued to inmates\nconsist of a general list of infractions classified by level of\nseriousness.  Included with this list is a generalized statement\nas to the punishment to be given if a certain rule is broken.  The\njail purports to have a policy whereby all inmates are to receive\na copy of these rules upon admission.  However, officers neglect\nto provide this document to incoming inmates.  Frequently inmates\nare, therefore, unaware of the existence of any formal rules or\nregulations.\n30.  When inmates do violate a rule or regulation, no due\nprocess whatsoever is afforded the inmate.  Guilt or innocence is\nan arbitrary decision made by the individual guard and the inmate\nmay or may not be punished depending on the mood of the guard.\nThere is no procedure for appeal of a decision of guilt.\n31.  A procedure exists for reducing the time to be served by\na sentenced inmate if he shows good behavior while in the jail.\nInmates lost \"good time\", as this practice is called, on the whim\nof the corrections officers, and are frequently not informed of\nthis decision when it is made.\n32.  Shakedowns occur at unreasonable times and are harrass-\ning in nature.  When shakedowns do occur, it is normal practice\nfor officers to throw bedding onto floors that have standing pools\nof water and to scatter personal items throughout the cell areas,\ncausing them to become lost and damaged.\n33.  When admitted to the jail, all of an inmate's personal\neffects are placed in a numbered bin in the property room located\nin the basement.\n34.  Inmates are subjected to verbal abuse from officers, such\nas threats, name-calling, intimidations, insinuations, and harassment.\n35.  There is no established procedure for registering inmate\ncomplaints.  The inmate must depend upon the good humor of the\nstaff to correct any problem he or she might be having.\nT\n\nINMATE SECURITY AND SUPERVISION\n36.  Those persons hired as guards for the St. Louis County\nT\nJail receive no training to prepare them for their duties at a\ndetention facility.\n37.  There is no effective procedure for the classification\nof inmates.  Pre-trial detainees, misdemeants and felons are all\nhoused together.  No classification procedure exists based upon\ninmates' age, physical size, crime or experience with the criminal\njustice system.  The only system of classification which does exist\nis an arbitrary one imposed by the staff attempting to separate\nviolent inmates from those more well-behaved.\n38.  Adequate supervision of the inmates is impeded by the\nstructure of the jail itself and the limited number of guard staff\nemployed by the jail.  There is no central location in the jail\nwhere guards can supervise inmates located in cells and there are\ntoo few guards on duty at any given time to have someone stationed\non each of the floors at all times.  Consequently, when assaults\nor medical emergencies have occurred in the past, guards have had\ndifficulty determining from what part of the jail an inmate's cries\nfor help have come.  Delays in locating disturbances or medical\nemergencies have resulted in unnecessary injuries which could have\nbeen prevented.  In instances where inmates are so severely injured\nor seriously ill preventing them from crying out for help, even\nmore grievous harm has occurred.\nT\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF DETENTION IN THE JAIL\nT 39.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent suffer mental and\nemotional as well as physical harm by incarceration at the St. Louis\nCounty Jail.  Long-term psychological damage results from the degrada-\ntion and demoralization associated with the unsanitary and inhumane\nliving conditions, the lack of adequate recreational facilities, the\nlong hours of idleness, the isolation, the deficient health program,\nthe almost total denial of contact with their families and friends,\nand the inconsistent treatment by jail personnel.  This atmosphere\ndeprives plaintiffs and the class they represent of all dignity and\nseverely damages their mental and emotional well-being.  The mental\nand emotional harm is demonstrated by the numerous suicide attempts\nat the jail.\n\nFREEDOM TO PRACTICE RELIGION\n40.  No special diets are provided for those inmates whose\nreligious preference requires one.\nT\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n41.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent, pre-trial detainees.\nFirst Amendment Rights are violated by the officers, who place the\ninmates' reading material from publishers in the property bin with-\nout allowing the inmates access to the bin.  The inmates are restricted\nto only two pieces of literature per week.\n42.  Pre-trial detainees are impaired as to their right to aid\nin the preparation of their defense at trial in the following manner:\na.  There is no adequate facility for private conversations\nbetween inmates and attorneys.  Most attorney-client visits take\nplace in social workers' offices.  Attorneys who do wish to speak\nprivately with their clients must wait their turn to use the  social\nworker's office.  The hours for these visits are limited, and if\nthere are a large number of requests for private attorney visits,\nthere may be a delay of several days before an inmate can consult\nprivately with his attorney.\nb.  The jail does not have a law library.  The legal books\nare scattered remotely in social workers' offices and are inadequate\nto assist the inmates.  No provisions are made for inmates to have\naccess to a law library if they should need to use one.\nc.  Inmate's legal papers, documents, notes, letters, and\nother records have been confiscated or destroyed.\nd.  Writing  paper, pens, envelopes, etc., are often diffi-\ncult to obtain, especially by those detainees who are indigent.\ne.  Lack of access to telephones inhibits proper attorney-\nclient communication.  There are no special telephone privileges\nfor contacting attorneys, so a detainee has to use his one weekly\ncall for this purpose.  If the attorney is not in his office when\nthe call is made, the inmate cannot try again for another week.\n43.  Inmates are often forced to appear in court unshaven and\nwearing dirty, malodorous clothing.  The psychological impact of\nbeing unable to relate to a jury as dignified human beings has\ncaused many inmates to be ineffective witnesses at trial.\n44.  Information, rumors and personal correspondence concerning\nan inmate's case are openly and loudly discussed by jail staff.",

None of the complaining\nwitnesses appeared to be anything but well nourished\nand the complaints bordered on frivolity.  The reviewing\nMagistrate is satisfied that the diet in the St. Louis\nCounty Jail comports with the requirements of Ahrens\nv. Thomas, 570 F.2d 286, 289 (8th Cir. 1978J; Campbell\nv. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503 (8th Cir. 1980).\nINTERNAL ASSAULTS\nThe litigants in this matter made a realistic\nevaluation of the internal assault problem in their\nstipulation, page 26.  Internal assaults in jails and\npenal institutions are an ever present problem.  Tension,\nproximity, frustration, fear of punishment, lack of\nsex and racial tension contribute to frequent, physical\nand emotional conflict.  The jail in question is antiquated\nand was built to serve a county one-third its present\nsize.\nAt the hearing conducted by the reporting\nMagistrate, one detainee, who wanted to remain anonymous,\nreported that he had been raped while another inmate\nwatched.  He said he reported the incident and the Clayton\nPolice subsequently investigated.  He was moved to isolation\nfor his own protection.  Bullington himself said he saw\na sexual assault in 1977, but did not report the incident\nbecause of fear.  One Kay Brown, a social worker, testified\nthat she only knew of one assault (the one reported\nby the anonymous detainee).\n-3-\n\n;\n7-\nUpon\nor  about\n t he\nr..p. .\netlv\nOl> or\nabout  the 27th\n:;;r -'\nj. in Cause No.\n B ru\n:  •\"•• °\n«\n••••  •••• • • • • '-\n«,,\n\"»••\"«.«.... c. .. »„.\no\n\norder as to the future movement of the detainee.

Inasmuch as there is no reason to censure\nthe jailer or require direction in this area, the reviewing\nMagistrate makes no observations on the length of pretrial\ndetention.\nTherefore, the reviewing Magistrate, recommends\nthat the above observations coupled with the stipulation\nof the parties, be posted in the St. Louis County Jail\nto invite objection, if necessary, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§636(b).\nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE\nDated:  June 21, 1983\nTT1",

Hungate.\nPlaintiff Bruce was seeking \"contact\" visits with his\nvisitors.  The county jail does not allow any touch or\nphysical contact between detainee and visitors.\nOn or about April 15, 1982, plaintiff, William\nJ. Bruce, left the custody of the County Department of\nJustice Services, Inc., and was transported to the Department\nof Corrections of the State of Missouri in Jefferson\nCity as a result of a commitment and sentence of fifty\nyears to said department.  ,  ,\nAny claims made by Plaintiff Bruce have been\nrendered moot by the removal of said plaintiff from the\ncustody of defendant as aforedescribed.  However, the\nCourt notes that contact visits are not constitutionally\nguaranteed.  Second, the Court finds refusal of such\nvisits to be reasonable in this particular institutional\nsetting.  Feeley v. Sampson, 570 F.2d 364 (1st Cir. 1978).\n\n:  t\n^Therefore, it is the recommendation of the\nundersigned Magistrate that subject case be DISMISSED\nas being MOOT.

HAGEL,  P.E.,  DIRECTOR\nApril 23, 1976\nMEMORANDUM TO:  Leo Plante, Superintendent of County Jail\nSUBJECT:  Improvement of Welfare Facilities - Annex\nIn the last five years the Department of Public Works has been\ninvolved with your Department in more than $1,200,000 of capital\ninvestment for the improved handling, lodging and safety of con-\nfined persons.  This expenditure of Federal and County funds has\nmade it possible to create a unique Intake Service Center which\nis gaining national reknown and, considering the physical restraints\nof the building, improved confinement facilities to a high standard.\nBeginning in 1971, this Department worked with the firm of Winkler,\nThompson & Associates, Architects, and the National Clearing House\nto produce a design for a renovated Jail.  This, when completed in\n1973,  included a completely renewed kitchen, a new twelve-cell\nholdover area, two medium security resident modules, a new seven-\ncell close security section and infirmary, visiting, interview,\ncontrol and administrative facilities.  Complete air conditioning,\nmodern fire safety equipment, CCTV and other communication means\nwere installed.  This project cost $935,000.\nIn 1974 the showers, toilets and lavatories in the older cell blocks\nwere completely replaced and the women's confinement area was com-\npletely rebuilt by a County investment of more than $60,000.\nIn 1975 this Department constructed the Intake Service Center which\nit had designed during the preceding year.  We are pleased that your\nDepartment has been able to operate the ISC at the high level aimed\nat by our designers.  The total cost of the facility with its inter-\nfaces with the Jail and the facilities of the Department of Police\nrequired a $115,000 investment of County funds.  During 1975, this\nDepartment also began the conversion of space on the floor beneath\nthe Jail into two dormitories with appropriate auxiliary facilities\nfor the housing of approximately 50 Work Release inmates.  These\nfacilities represent a County investment of approximately $40,000.\nWe have begun the reconstruction of former courtroom and office space\non the 2nd floor of the building for an athletic facility.  This will\ncontain a pair of handball/racketball courts, an exercise room and\nf\nT 9 OO  F O R S Y TH  B O U L E V A R D.

We also have procured safety cigarette lighters\nand electrical supplies for the installation of these non-flame\napparatus in the confinement areas this summer.  The County will\ninvest approximately $25,000 and eight man-months' labor in these\ntwo projects.\nAs Mr. Brooks stated to the Director of Welfare on April 21, the\nattitude of persons confined toward the confining facilities will\nscarcely ever be flattering.  This Department, however, is quite\nproud of its participation in these improvements which we believe\nwere each well suited to the needs of your Department within the\nspace available and are of real service to the citizens of St. Louis\nCounty.\nRobert C.

Each of such renovated confinement areas or cells shall have a\nshower, toilet facilities, wash basin, mirror and a shelf or shelves for the purpose of holding personal effects of the\nprisoners. Upon completion of the entire construction and renovation project, there will be twelve (12) such\ndescribed eight (8) man confinement areas or cells, thus having a total maximum capacity of ninety-six (96)\nprisoner inmates, with no more than eight (8) persons confined in any confinement area or cell at any given time.\nEach of the new cells, as renovated, shall have a sleeping area of seventeen (17) feet by eight (8) feet, by eight\n\n(8) feet, and a living area of fifteen (15) feet by eight (8) feet by eight (8) feet. The final work with regard to said\nrenovation and reconstruction shall be performed and completed within one (1) year from the date hereof; if,\nhowever, for any reason it shall appear to defendant Edward M.

LOUIS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE SERVICES, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nThis case is now before this Court on the motions of the parties to accept\nand approve the stipulation they have reached disposing of several issues in this litiga-\ntion.  In addition, three issues not disposed of by the Stipulation of the Parties are now\nf\nbefore this Court for final decision.  With respect to the latter three issues, this Court\n\nhas the benefit of a Magistrate's Memorandum from William S. Bahn, United States\nJ  Magistrate.\nI.  Background:\nThis case is a class action filed on behalf of all persons who are detained, or\nwill be detained at the St. Louis County Jail, awaiting trial on alleged offenses against\nthe State of Missouri.  Plaintiffs' action was brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983. They\nalleged that certain conditions at the St. Louis County Jail were violative of their consti-\ntutional rights.  Specifically, they complained of the following:\n1.  cold food and inadequate portions thereof;\n2.  substandard medical-dental facilities;\n3.  overcrowding by excess population;\n4.  lack of a serviceable law library;\n5.  failure to provide prisoners with jail rules;\n6.  lack of cleanliness;\nT\n•  7.  prisoner mail from courts and attorneys being censored;\n8.  strip searches, especially after visits;\n9.  antiquated visiting booths creating inadequate communication;\n10.  internal assaults;\n11.  lack of recreation;\n12.  length of pretrial detention;\n13.  and separation of certified minors.\nSubsequent to filing the initial complaint, this case was consolidated with\nJohnson, et al., vs. O'Brien, et al., No. 76-210C(2), in which this Court had previously\nentered a final judgment and decree; and William J. Bruce v. St. Louis County\nDepartment of Justice Services, et al., No. 82-223C(4).  John P. Emde and James L.\nThomas were appointed to represent plaintiffs.  Thereafter, the case was referred to\n<*\"  William S. Bahn, United States Magistrate, for his report and recommendation.\n\nMagistrate Bahn ably handled the bulk of this case.  He conducted surprise\nvisits at the jail, held hearings and gathered evidence, and prepared a \"Report and\nRecommendation\" on plaintiffs' claims.  Action on the Magistrate's report, prepared on\nJuly 24, 1981, was deferred by this Court pending the outcome of voluntary compliance\nand settlement negotiations between the parties.\nThe voluntary efforts of the parties produced a Stipulation of the Parties, a\ncopy of which is attached hereto at Appendix A.  This stipulation contained a stipulation\nof facts and a proposed remedy with respect to each of the above-mentioned complaints,\nexcept those with respect to food, internal assaults and length of pretrial detention.\nEven with respect to the latter three issues, the parties were able to arrive at a stipula-\ntion of the facts.  See Stip. at 18-19, 26-27, and 28-29.  On June 21, 1983, Magistrate\nBahn filed a Magistrate's Memorandum, a copy of which is attached hereto at Appendix\nJ3, containing his recommendations with respect to the three issues not remedied by the\nstipulation.  In addition, on June 22, 1983, Magistrate Bahn recommended that Case No.\n82-223C(l) be dismissed as moot on the ground that the sole plaintiff  in that case,\nWilliam J. Bruce, had been sentenced and removed to the Department of Corrections of\nthe State of Missouri in Jefferson  City.  As an alternative ground for dismissing plantiff\nBruce's case, Magistrate Bahn noted that \"contact visits\", the relief Bruce was seeking,\nwere not constitutionally required.\nOn June 22, 1983, this Court ordered the Stipulation of the Parties and the\nMagistrate's Memorandum posted in a conspicuous place in the St. Louis County Jail with\na notice that written objections thereto were to be filed with this Court within ten (10)\ndays of June 22, 1983. To date only one such objection has been received.  It is from\nJoseph Survillo.  His comments are more in the nature of additional complaints about jail\nconditions than objections to the Stipulation and Memorandum.  Basically he complains\nthat there is hair and egg shells in his food, that the jail had contact visits before and\nshould therefore have them again, that he is unhappy with the medical treatment, and\nT\n\nthat the visiting booths are antiquated.  In addition, he requests that this Court periodi-\n*  cally visit and inspect the jail.\nOn August 12, 1983, the attorneys for the parties appeared in open court and\nsigned the Stipulation.  A hearing was held by this Court and it was determined that the\nStipulation disposed of all claims of the parties, with the exception of the three\nmentioned above.  In addition, it was determined that, in accordance with the\nStipulation, attorneys for the plaintiffs were entitled to a reasonable fee and that the\nfiling of verified petitions and objections thereto were contemplated with regard to fees.\nII.  Opinion;\nA.  The Stipulation:\nIt is the opinion of this Court that the Stipulation prepared by the\nparties is a fair and equitable disposition of this case.  The parties plaintiff  and defend-\nants Moreland and McNary are to be commended for their efforts in arriving at a\n/IT  compromise solution to the problems facing the St. Louis County Jail.  Moreover, the\nremedies stipulated by the parties are just and are calculated to effectively reduce or\neliminate the complaints of  plaintiffs.\nAccordingly, pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, notice having been given to the parties of the terms of the Stipulation, this\nCourt accepts the Stipulation of the Parties.  Further, this Court orders that the reme-\ndies agreed upon by the parties shall be carried out.  Further, this Court orders that the\nStipulation of the Parties fully disposes of the claims of plaintiffs, with the exception of\nthe three issues mentioned above.\nB.  Unresolved Issues:\nAs discussed, supra, the Stipulation does not dispose of three issues:\nfood, internal assaults and length of pre-trial detention.  The factual bases of these\nissues have been stipulated to and Magistrate Bahn has given this Court the benefit of his\nY  recommendations on these issues in the Magistrate's Memorandum.  All that remains is\n\nfor this Court to determine whether the facts establish any illegal conduct on the part of\ndefendants and, if so, what remedy is appropriate.\n1.  Cold Food and Inadequate Portions Thereof:\nAccording to the Stipulation, at 18-19, and the Magistrate's\nMemorandum, at 2, plaintiffs' complaints with regard to the food served at the jail\ninclude, inter alia, hair and egg shells in the food, the food is occasionally cold, religious\neating prohibitions are not accommodated and they dislike some of the vegetables\nserved.\nUpon consideration of the record, the Stipulation, the\nMagistrate's Memorandum and the objections thereto, it is the opinion of this Court that,\nin the words of Judge Bahn, plaintiffs' complaints about the food \"border on frivolity\".\nMagistrate's Memorandum at 3. In addition, this Court accepts Magistrate Bahn's conclu-\nsion that the diet of plaintiffs at the St. Louis County Jail complies with and meets the\nstandards of Campbell v. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503 (8th Cir. 1980) and Ahrens v. Thomas,\n570 F.2d 286 (8th Cir. 1978).  Therefore, this Court holds that the actions of defendants\nwith respect to the food served at the St. Louis County Jail does not fail to meet mini-\nmum constitutinal standards.\n2.  Internal Assaults;\nUpon consideration of the record, the Stipulation, the\nMagistrate's Memorandum and the objections thereto, it is the opinion of this Court that\ndefendants have not violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights with respect to the occur-\nrence of assaults by inmates on other inmates.  This Court accepts Magistrate Bahn's\nrecommendation that the assaults are not widespread or frequent and that \"all reasonably\npossible is being done to obviate violence.\"  Magistrate's Memorandum at 4.  \"In the\nabsence of constitutional violations, [courts should] defer to the judgment of state prison\nadministrators.\"  Campbell v. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503, 505 (8th Cir. 1980) (citations\nomitted).  This Court is convinced that defendants are doing everything possible to\n\nprevent assaults in the jail and that the procedures outlined in the Stipulation, at 26-27,\nare constitutionally adequate.  Therefore, this Court declines to order any remedial\nmeasures with respect to plaintiffs' complaints about internal assaults.\n3.  Length of Pre-Trial Detention;\nAccording to the Stipulation and the Magistrate's\nMemorandum, at 28-29, the length of pre-trial detention is not a matter within the\ncontrol or discretion of defendants.  It is a matter basically within the jurisdiction of the\nstate courts.  In fact, the concentrated efforts of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County\nin expediting the trial of such inmates have helped immeasurably in reducing the total\nnumber of detainees at the County jail.\nBecause an order against these defendants would not reduce\nthe length of pre-trial detention, this Court accepts Magistrate Bahn's recommendation\nthat there is no reason for this Court to order relief against defendants with respect to\nthe length of pre-trial detention.\nC.  William J. Bruce v. St. Louis County Department of Justice Services,\nInc., No. 82-223C(l);\nWith regard to Mr. Bruce's claim that \"contact visits\" should be\nallowed, this Court accepts the recommendation of Magistrate Bahn that his case be\ndismissed as moot.  Mr. Bruce, individually, has no standing to complain of the lack of\ncontact visits at the St. Louis County Jail when he no longer resides there.\nIn addition, and as an alternative ground for dismissing plaintiff\nBruce's claim, this Court accepts the Magistrate's recommendation that contact visits\nare not constitutionally required and that their denial is reasonable in defendants' institu-\ntion.\nIII.  Conclusion:\nIt is the opinion of this Court that this Memorandum, the Order filed herein\nthis date, the Stipulation, and the Magistrate's Memorandum, fully dispose of all issues\nand claims in the present litigation.",

Section 1331, 134(3),\nM\n(4), 2201 and 2202.  This action arises under Title 42 U.S.C. Section\n1983,  and including but not limited to the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United\nm.\n•States, wherein the plaintiffs, individually, and on behalf of all\nOthers similarly situtated, claim that rights guaranteed to them\nWere violated by the above-named defendants acting in their official\ncapacities under color of State law and the St. Louis County Charter.\n' . ,  PARTIES\nc\n2.  Plaintiff ROBERT E. BULLINGTON has been confined in the\nSt. Louis County Jail for the past 18 months.  He was unable to\n\nc post bond and is being held on the charge of first degree murder.\nPlaintiffs STEVEN I... TOMEY, GLEM REYNOLDS, and MICHAEL CLARK have\nbeen confined in the St. Louis County Jail, for the past 30 days.\n;.>,  They have been charged with felonies and have been unable to post\nbond.  All the plaintiffs are adult citizen;; oi the United States.\n• :  3.  Defendant GENE McJJAUY is the elected Supervisor of St.\nLouis County, elected pursuant to the laws of the State of Missouri\nand St. Louis County Charter to carry out those duties presented in\n.:-;•  Article III Section 3.050 (3), (4) (5) and et seq of the St. Louis\n••'•  County Charter 1968 as amended.  Included within his responsibilities\n'.  are the \"coordination and supervision the work of the departments\nand agencies of the county....executure and enforce the provisions\n'-' y'  of this aharter....\"  The agents'-, subordinates and employees of\n;\nfV.i'  Supervisor GENE Mr.NAKY are also responsible for the proper care\ni :  and treatment of those citizens incarcerated in the St. Louis\ni  County Jail.  Supervisor GENE McNary and his agents, subordinates\n. .  and emploees also nave the duties to carry out all court orders and\ndirections and not to subject plaintiffs and the class they repre-\nsent to constitutional violations.\n4.  Defendant EDWARD MORELAND  is the Director of St. Louis\nCounty Department of Welfare duly appointed pursuant to Article IV\nof the St. Louis County Charter 1969 as amended.  Pursuant to Section\n4.410 (7) et seq of Article IV of the County Charter of St. Louis\nCounty 1969 as amended.  He has the \" custody, rule, keeping and charge\nof all jails and correctional institutions and all prisioners\ntherein...\"\n5.  Both defendants are sued in their official capacities and\nare also sued in their individual capacities as citizens of the\nUnited States and the State of Missouri.\nCLASS ACTION\n6.  Plaintiffs, Robert E. Bullington, Steven L. Toney, Glen\nReynolds and Michael Clark, are members of a class of persons who are\ndetained at the St. Louis County Jail while awaiting trial on alleged\noffenses against the State of Missouri.  Plaintiffs bring this action\npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf\n= 2 =\n\nof themselves and all other persons constituirig the classes de-\nf\nscribed above who are similarly situated.  Their action is main-\ntained as a class action because:\n(1) the persons in these classes are so numerous that joinder\nof all members is impractical;\n(2)  there are questions of lav; and fact common to the class;\n(3)  the claims of the plaintiffs in the case are typical of\nthe claims of the class; and\n(4)  the plaintiffs in this case will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.\nThis action is particularly appropriate as a class action be-\ncause prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the\nclass would create a. risk of adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive\nOf the interests of other members not parties to the adjudication.\nFurther, defendants have acted and refused to act on the grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class thereby making appropriate final\nc\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect\nto the class as a whole.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n7.  Plaintiffs and the classes each represent have been, are,\nand will continue to be subjected to the shocking, dehumanizing,\nillegal and unconstitutional conditions and practices enumerated\nin this complaint.  These conditions and practices exist because\nof the willful and intentional acts, policies and omissions of the\ndefendants in this action.\n8.  The St. Louis County Jail was erected in 1940 to serve as\na \"county\" jail.  At that time the population of St. Louis County\nwas less than 1 million and the County was primarily rural.  The\ncounty has grown and its character changed as the St. Louis County\nMetropolitan Area has grown.  The county is now primarily urban\nwith a population in excess of one million.\n9.  The inmates in the St. Louis County Jail, both pre-trial\nn\ndetainees and sentenced inmates, are housed on the 4th floor of the\nstructure.\n10.  The St. Louis County Jail's inmate population fluctuates.\nThe average daily number of prisoners housed at the jail is 112.\n\nUNSANITARY AMD UNSAFE CONDITIONS\n11.  The cells are infected with roaches and mice.  There is\nalso a fungus which frequently grows on some walls of the jail\nduring periods of high humidity and heat.  Whenever this fungus\nis present, there ia aii increase of respiratory ailments among\nthe inmates.\n12.  Windows in the jail vary in their condition.  In 1975\na majority of the windows wore blocked up and air conditioning\nunits installed.  The exhaust vents on the roof provide the only\nsource of ventilation in the cell areas.  This lack of ventilation\ncauses foul odors to collect and constantly permeat the air.\n13.  The mattreses for the bunks are filthy, foul-smelling\nand never cleaned, aired out or disinfected.  No mattress covers\naire furnished and there is often a long period of time between\nchanging of sheets.\n14.  The only cleaning in the jail is done by the inmates.\nInmates who are trustees are responsible for the halls and common\nf areas, while all inmates are solely responsible for their cells.\nInmates who are not trustees frequently have difficulty obtaining\nthe proper cleaning tools, such as mops and brooms.\n15.  Showers and open toilet areas are contained in each cell\nexcept for the women's cell that has a separate enclosed bath room.\nThe only cleaning of these areas is done by the inmates occupying\nthe individual cells who are seldom provided with the proper materials\nto adequately clean these areas.  Consequently these areas are\nbreeding grounds tor bacteria and fungus.\n16.  Inmates are required to eat their meals in their cells,\nwhich are usually in a dirty and unsanitary condition due to the\nlimited amount of cleaning previously described.\n17.  There is insufficient hot water for inmates to take\nshowers.  Normally an inmate must shower in cold water or remain\ndirty.\n18.  Personal hygiene items such as shampoo, soap, tooth paste,\nc\ntooth brushes, and combs, are sometimes difficult to obtain.  No\n=4=\n\nrazors are given to any inmates, except during sporadic times\nf\nwhen groups of inmates are allowed to shave in one common room.\n19.  Laundry is supposed to be done once a week for all inmates\nby the trustees.  However, because of breakdowns in the equipment,\nwashing is often done only once a month.  Also inmates must wash\ntheir own socks in the sink without any detergent.\n20.  There are heating and cooling problems, causing the jail\nto be unreasonably cold in the winter and unreasonably hot in the\nsummer.  At all times, the temperature varies from floor to floor.\nInmates often suffer the harsh physiological effects of temperature\nextremes.\nLACK OF USE OF RECREATIONAL FACILITIES\n21.  An indoor .area is provided for exercise or reci'eation\nof the inmates, but is not utilized due to a shortage of staff to\nsupervise the area.  This lack of recreation leads to mental and\nphysical deterioration.\nF O OD\nd\\  22.  The food served to the inmates is nutritionally deficient.\nFood which is supposed to be hot is always cold.  Inmates never\nreceive fresh fruits or vegetables.  The portions of food which\ninmates do receive are too small, leaving inmates still hungry\nimmediately after eating a meal.\nMEDICAL FACILITIES AND CARE\n23.  An inmate needing medical attention or medication from\n5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. must request it by getting a written or oral\nmessage to a correctional officer.  These officers have no procedure\nfor routinely checking with inmates to see who needs medical atten-\ntion and they do not in fact do so.  Even when officers receive re-\nquests for medical attention, these messages may not be transmitted\npromptly to the medical staff and they may not be conveyed to the\nmedical staff at all.  Therefore, inmates must sometimes endure\nunreasonable delay in obtaining needed care.  For \"minor\" problems,\nsuch as colds, sores, dandruff, insect bites, rashes, corns,\nn\nathlete's foot, headaches and tooth achos, it is very difficult to\nget any relief, even an aspirin.\n= 5=\n\nr\n24.  When medical  requests are made, the officer decides  if\nthe inmate receives medical  attem ion.  The officer has no spe-\ncialized  training  to diagnosis or to determine  if medical assis-\ntance is required.  Therefore, the decision  to allow medical\nassistance is often at  the wiiim of the officer.\n25.  There is no medical  screening procedure to test  for\ncontagious diseases.  Trustees who handle all food  preparation\ntasks do receive a limited amount of screening for certain diseases.\nHowever, this screening frequently does not take place until  the\ninmate has been on the job for a number of weeks, thus  rendering\nthese tests meaningless, exposing other inmates to great harm.\n26.  No dental care is provided.\n'•-\"••  •  VISITATION AND COMMUNICATION  RIGHTS\n' \"  27.  The visiting  facilities are grossly  inadequate.  The\nvisitation  area consists of a \"fish-bowl\" area where visitors  enter.\nInmates are viewed  through glass-like panels which are the walls\nof the  \"fish-bowl\".  If more than two or three persons  occupy\n!•  '  this area it becomes very crowded.  Inmates with visitors must\nstand on the outside of the  \"fish-bowl\" and communicate with  their\nvisitors through a hole.  They are difficult for effective  and\nmeaningful communication.  There is only one visit allowed per week.\nEach  inmate is allotted  1/2 hour per week  for visitation, with a\nlimit of 3 visitors.\n28.  Inmates are allowed an initial phone call upon  admittance\nand are thereafter  allowed  to make one call per week.  According\nto the whims of some guards, certain inmates are permitted  to make\nmore calls, while some have their weekly  call delayed until  the\nvery end of the week.  Inmates are only allowed to speak  to the\nperson called  for a period of 5 minutes.  The calls take place  in\nan office, with a social worker or officer present, depriving  them\nof any privacy.  If an inmate uses this call to speak with  his\nattorney, he is denied the confidentiality  of the  attorney-client\nrelationship.\no\n\nJAIL DISCIPLINE\n29.  The only written rules and regulations issued to inmates\n^  consist of a general list, of iniiactions classified by level of\nseriousness.  Included with this list is a generalized statement\n'  as to the punishment to be given if a certain rule is broken.  The\njail purports to have a policy whereby all inmates are to receive\na copy of these rules upon admission.  However, officers neglect\nto provide this document to incoming inmates.  Frequently inmates\nare, therefore, unaware of the existance of any formal rules or\nregulations.\n30.  When inmates do violate a rule or regulation, no due\nprocess whatsoever is afforded the inmate.  Guilt or innocence is\nan arbitrary decision made by the individual guard and the inmate\n>  ' may or may not be punrshed depending on the mood of the guard.\n_. .  There is no procedure for appeal of a decision of guilt.\n31.  A procedure exists for reducing the time to be served\nby a sentenced inmate if he shows good behavior while in the jail.\nInmates lose \"good time\", as this practice is called, on the whim\n\"  I  of the corrections officers and are frequently not informed of\nthis decision when it is made.\n32.  Shakedowns occur at unreasonable times and are harrassing\nin nature.  When shakedowns do occur it is normal practice for\nofficers to throw bedding onto floors that have standing pools of\nwater and to scatter personal items throughout the cell areas,\ncausing them to become lost and damaged.\n33.  When admitted to the jail, all of an inmate's personal\neffects are placed in a numbered bin in the property room located\nin the basement.\n34.  Inmates are subjected to verbal abuse from officers,\nsuch as threats, name-calling, intimidations, insinuations and\nharrassment.\n.'  35.  There is no established procedure for registering inmate\ncomplaints.  The inmate must depend upon the good humor of the\n^  staff to correct any problem he or she might be having.\no  |-\n-7-\n\nINMATE SECURITY AND SUPERVISION\nc\n36.  Those persons hired as guards for the Kt. Louis\nCounty Jail receive no training to prepare them for their duties\nat a detention facility.\n37.  There is no effective procedure for the classification\nof inmates.  Pre-trial detainees, misderaeants and felons are all\nhoused together.  No classification procedure exists based upon\ninmates' age, physical size, crime or experience with the criminal\njustice system.  The only system of classification which does exist\nis an arbitrary one imposed by the staff attempting to separate\nviolent inmates from those more well-behaved.\n30.  Adequate supervision of the inmates is impeded by the\nstructure of the jail itself and the limited number of guard staff\nemployed by the jail.  There is no central location in the jail\nwhere guards can supervise inmates located in cells and there are\ntoo few guards on duty at any given time to have someone stationed\non each of the floors at all times.  Consequently, when assaults\nor medical emergencies have occurred in the past, guards have had\ndifficulty determining from what part of the jail an inmate's cries\nfor help have come.  Delays in locating disturbances or medical\nemergencies have resulted in unnecessary injuries which could have\nbeen prevented.  In instances where inmates are so severely injured\nor seriously ill preventing them from crying out for help, even\nmore grievous harm has occurred.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF DETENTION IN THE JAIL\n39.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent suffer mental\nand emotional as well as physical harm by incarceration at the\nSt. Louis County Jail.  Long term psychological damage results from\nthe degradation and demoralization associated with the unsanitary\nand inhumane living conditions, the lack of adequate recreational\nfacilities, the long hours of idleness, the isolation, the deficient\nhealth program, the almost total denial of contact with their\nfamilies and friends, and the inconsistent treatment by jail\npersonnel.  This atmosphere deprives plaintiffs and the class they\n= 8=\n\nrepresent of all dignity and severely damages their mental and\nf emotional well=being.  The mental and emotional harm is demon-\nstrated by the numerous suicide attempts at the jail.\nFREEDOM TO PRACTICE RELIGION\n40.  No special diets are provided for those inmates whose\nreligious preference requires one.\nIMPAIRMENT OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n41.  Plaintiffeand the class they represent, pretria] detainees,\nFirst Amendment Rights are violated by the officers placing the\ninmates' reading material from publishers in the property bin\nwithout allowing the inmates access to the bin.  The inmates are\nrestricted to only two pieces of literature per week.\n42.  Pretrial detainees are impaired as to their right to aid\nin the preparation of their defense at trial in the following\nmanner.\na.  There is no adequate facility for private conversations\nbetween inmates and attorneys.  Most attorney-client visits take\nplace in Social Workers' offices.  Attorneys who do wish to speak\nprivately with their clients must wait their turn to use the Social\nWorker's office.  The hours for these visits are limited and if\nthere are a large number of requests for private attorney visits,\nthere may be a delay of several days before an inmate can consult\nprivately with his attorney.\nb.  The jail does not have a Law Library.  The legal books\nare scattered remotely in Social Works' offices and are inadequate\nto assist the inmates. tio provisions are made for inmates to have\naccess to a law library if they should need to use one.\nc.  Inmate's legal papers, documents, notes, letters, and other\nrecords have been confiscated or destroyed.\nd.  Writing paper, pens, envelopes, etc. are often difficult\nto obtain, especially by those detainees who are indigent.\ne.  Lack of access to telephones inhibits proper attorney-\nclient communication.  There are no special telephone privileges\nfor contacting attorneys, so a detainee has to use his one weekly\n\ncall for this purpose.  If the attorney is not in his office when\nthe call is made, the inmate cannot try again for another week.\n43.  Inmates are often forced to appear in court unshaven and\nwearing dirty, malodorous clothing.  The psychological impact of\nbeing unable to relate to a jury as dignified human beings has\ncaused many inmates to be ineffective witnesses at trial.\n44.  Information, rumors and personal correspondence concerning\nan inmate's case are openly and loudly discussed by jail staff.\nFIRST CLAIM\n43.  The imposition of summary, harsh and brutal punishment\nand conditions upon plaintiffs and their class enumerated in\nparagraphs 9 through 44 denies them the right to be free from cruel\nand unusual punishment in contravention of the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nSECOND CLAIM\n46.  That the conditions found in the St. Louis County Jail are\nseverely punitive in nature and effectively punish the class of\npre-trial detainees and prior to trial and before they have been\nconvicted of any crimes or given any sentence.  Thus detainees\nare deprived of their life and liberty without due process of law,\nall in violation of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States.\nTHIRQ CLAIM\n47.  Failure; .to afford plaintiffs proper disciplinary hearings\nprior to imposition of punishment and the arbitrary taking away of\n\"good time\" as described in paragraphs 29 through 35 denies plaintiffs\nlife and liberty without due process of law in contravention of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States.\nFOURTH CLAIM\n48.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent are denied\neffective representation of counsel and the right to a fair trial\nguaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constituion, by the practices, procedures, acts and policies,\n= 10=\n\nof the defendants which described in paragraphs 42 through 44\nT which restrict, limit and prevent access to legal materials, to\nlegal counsel ant to othoi pel sons ami moans necessary to prepare\na defense.\nFIFTH CLAIM\n49.  Failure to provide a law library and other materials\nneeded by plaintiffs and the class they represent or to provide\na reasonable alternative to direct access to a law library denies\nplaintiffs the right to access to the courts as guaranteed by\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nSIXTH CLAIM\n50.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent are denied the\nright to freedom of speech and association in violation of the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nby practices, procedures, acts and policies of defendants which\nrestrict and limit visitation, arbitrarily prohibit visitation\nwith certain friends, and deny plaintiffs the right to communicate\nwith other persons by means of telephone as enumerated in paragraphs\n27 and 28.\nSEVENTH CLAIM\n51.  Unreasonable searches and seizures of papers and effects\nand the careless handling of inmates' property as described in\nparagraphs 32 and 33 denies plaintiffs their right to be secure\nin their personal property in contravention of the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nEIGHTH CLAIM\n52.  Failure to provide special diets required by certain\nfaiths as discussed in 40 inhibits and restricts plaintiffs and\nthe class they represent from practicing the religion of their choice\nin contravention of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution.\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND OTHER INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n53.  There exists between the parties an actual controversy\nas herein set forth.  The plaintiffs and others similarly situated\nand affected, on whose behalf this action is maintained, are suffering\n\nirreparable injuries and are threatened with further irreparable\ninjuries in the future by reason of the acts and omissions herein\ncomplained of.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent, have no\nplain, adecjuate or complete remedy, administratively or at law,\nto redress the wrongs and unlawful acts herein complained of other\nthan this action for declaration of rights and for injunctive\nrelief.  Other remedies to which plaintiffs and others similarly\nsituated could bo remitted would be attended by such uncertainties\nand delays as to dany substantial relief and would involve multi-\nplicity of suits and would cause further irreparable injury, damage\nand inconvenience to the plaintiffs and others similarly situated.\nDefendants have persisted in deliberately subjecting plaintiffs\nand the classes Lhoy, ropreyotifc to inhumaiu!, brutal condition:.; and\nto the loss of rights secured to them by the Constitution of the\n! -  United States, despite protest and demands by public officials,\nprisoners, and other private citizens.  Unless there is a declaration\nof the rights of the plaintiffs and the classes they represent, these\nT\nunlawful acts, practices and omissions of the defendants will never\ncease and unless this Court restrains and enjoins the defendants\nfrom denying plaintiffs' constitutional rights, plaintiffs will\ncontinue to suffer irreparable injury without means of redress.\n54.  Plaintiffs thereby make a motion for a hearing on a pre-\nliminary injunction to enjoin the unconstitutional acts herein\nalleged.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n:  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class\nthey represent, respectfully pray for relief as follows:\n1.  That the Court enter an order that plaintiffs' action be\nmaintained as a class action.\n2.  That the Court thereafter order that all members of the\nclass be notified of the action by the posting of one copy of the\ncomplaint and the Court order establishing the class in a conspicuous\nplace in each section of the St. Louis County Jai.  There shall also\n^  be posted a notice explaining that the class action case is before\nj  the court and directing inmates to contact plaintiffs' attorneys or\n!\n1-  =12=\n\nthe Court if they have questions.  The notice shall for this reason\ninclude the names, addresses and telephone numbers of plaintiffs1\nattorneys.  These .1 V. t: 111;-. shall  i i main po.stod, being replaced by\ndefendants as necessary, during the pendency of this litigation.\n3.  That the Court enter an order declaring that due to the\nindividual and collective effects of their acts, practices and\nomissions, the defendants:\n(a) have subjected plaintiffs and the class they represent\nto punishment without due process of law and to cruel and\nunusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;\n(b) have deprived plaintiffs and the subclasses of pre-trial .\ndetainees whom they represent due to the punitive condi-\ntions found in the St. Louis County Jail of life and\nliberty without due process of law and contravened the\npresumption that they are innocent until proven guilty\nin violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited\"States Constitution;\n(c) have subjected plaintiffs and the class they represent\nto discipline without due process and in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;\n(d) have deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent\nof the right to effective assistance of counsel and of\nassisting in their defense and their constitutionally\nprotected right to a fair trial in violation of the Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constituion;\n(e) have deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent to\ntheir rights of access of the courts under the First and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constituion;\n(f) have deprived plaintiffs and the classes they represent\nof their rights to freedom of speech and association in\nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution;\n(g) have subjected plaintiffs and the classes they represent\nto unlawful searches and seizures of papers and effects\nand theft of their personal property in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and\n(h)  have deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent\nof their rights to freedom of religion in violation\nof the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n4.  That the Court issue preliminary and permanent injunctions\nenjoining and restraining defendants from engaging in any of the\nunlawful acts, practices or omissions complained of in this complaint.\n= 13=\n\n5.  That the Court order defendants to submit to the Court\nand thereafter implement a plan whereby plaintiffs and the class\nthey represent are assured:\n(a*)  that the St.. Louis County Jail and the cells therein be\nrestored to and kept in safe and sanitary condition,\nwith proper plumbing, heating, ventilation, cleaning,\nfumigation, and other repair and maintenance and that\nthe jail population be reduced to a number which can be\nsafely housed in the present jail facility;\n(b)  that the Court immediately order that no inmate be\nhoused in the St. Louis County Jail unless he can be\ncontinuously and directly viewed by a corrections officer\nwithout assistance of electronic aids and unless a\nsufficient number of additional officers be available\nto immediately intervene in any fight, assault or attack\nto protect him;\n(c)  that a regular recreational and exercise program outside\nof the cells and tanks be established and that inmates be\npermitted outside of the jail for sufficient periods to\nassure their continuous physical and mental well-being;\n(d)  that all inmates be fed in suitable, sanitary facilities\noutside of their cells, that meals be prepared and served\nin accordance with recognized nutritional standards and\nthat procedures providing for special diets for either\nhealth or religous purposes be established and followed;\n(e)  that inmates be permitted sufficient showers in safe\nand sanitary facilities to assure that they remain clean;\n(f)  that inmates be furnished clean and sanitary mattresses\nand beds, a complete set of bedding and clothing, including\nsocks and undergarments, which are cleaned and changed at\nleast three times weekly, adequate towels, proper cleaning\nequipment and other personal hygienic necessitities\n(such as toothpaste, soap, tooth brush);\n(g) that inmates be accorded essential preventive medical\nservices, including complete physical and mental examina-\ntions upon admission to the jail and periodically there-\nafter, and receive adequate medical, dental and mental\nhealth care;\n(h) that inmates be classified according to age, prior\nrecord and type of offense committed so that alleged,\nyouthful and first offenders are not confined with\nmultiple offenders;\n(i) that voluntary educational, vocational and work release\nr\nprograms be established;\n(j) that visiting regulations and facilities be established\nwhich insure decency, comfort, privacy, reasonable\n= 14 =\n\nvisiting periods and no restrictions on the identity of\nvisitors; and that visiting be increased to 7 days\na week;\n.(k) that initiates have access to books, magazines, newspapers\nand law books and other legal materials in sufficient\nquantity and quality;\n(1) that religious services following  the preferences of\nthe inmates be established;\n(rn) that adequate telephones, which shall not be subject to\nwire tapping or other monitoring, be installed and\nprisoners have access to them in order to make local\noutgoing calls without charge;\n(n) that no punishment, restraint or disciplinary measures\nbe taken against any inmate pursuant to procedures which\nassure, inter alia, that:\n(J)  inmates are disciplined only for infractions of\nspecific, written rules of conduct, which shall\nbe published and distributed to every inmate;\n(2)  the inmate is informed in writing of any charges\nagainst him, the name of the accusing officer,\nthe names of witnesses against him and the date\nand time of the hearing;\n(3)  the disciplinary panel is an impartial tribunal;\n(4)  the charging oggicer is present and testifies\nat the hearing;\n(5)  the inmate is allowed to testify in his own behalf;\n(6)  the inmate is allowed to call witnesses;\n(7)  the inmate is allowed to cross-examine the\ncharging officer and other witnesses;\n(0)  the inmae is allowed to select and to be assisted\nin investigation and at the hearing by an\nattorney, a law student, another inmate or a\nmember of the jail staff.\n(9)  a detailed record of the hearing is kept;\n(10)  decisions regarding guilt or innocence are based\non substantial evidence;\n(11)  findings of not guilty are clearly indicated\nin the inmate's instituion record;\n(12)  the inmate is informed of the reasons for\nthe Board's decision and disposition;\n(13)  all disciplinary proceedings are reviewed by\nthe Sheriff, who .shall not increase the severity\nof any disposition.\n(o)  That procedures for filing formal complaints or\ngrievances by inmates be established.\npage 15\n\n6.

Weyerich, Special Assistant County Counselor, their\n\nattorneys of record, and state to the Court and stipulate and\nagree as follows:\nIntroduction\n1.  Action No. 79-650 C (2) was filed on or about May 30,\n1979 by Robert Ernest Bullington, pro se, plaintiff; there-\nafter, this Court entered its Order appointing James L. Thomas\nas attorney for plaintiff, and in due course an Amended Com-\nplaint was filed on behalf of plaintiffs and, in response\nthereto, defendants filed their pleadings, including an Answer\nto Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.\n2.

The parties stipulate and agree that Plaintiffs'\nExhibit 21, generally referred to as the Feasibility Report for\nExpansion St. Louis County Government Center prepared by Pearce\nCorporation and transmitted to the County Executive and to the\nmembers of the St. Louis County Council by letter of transmit-\ntal of March 19, 1981 be received in evidence in this case\n(with respect to such parts of said Exhibit as relate to the\nSt. Louis County Jail located in the Courthouse complex in\nClayton, Missouri); the parties hereto further stipulate and\nagree that all of the factual statements contained in said\nExhibit 21 with respect to said County Jail are true and\naccurate and that all of the statements of opinion contained in\n-5-\n\n_  !said Exhibit are the opinions of those persons associated with\nthe Pearce Corporation whose names appear within said report,\nand that the said persons making said report are, by training,\nexperience, education and profession, qualified to state the\nopinions expressed therein by said persons.\n13.  The parties hereto further stipulate and agree that\ncounsel for plaintiffs and the Honorable Magistrate William S.\nBahn have visited, toured and inspected the jail facility oper-\nated by defendants in Clayton, Missouri and, with respect to\nthe directive of this Court concerning the compliance by defen-\ndants with the Order in Johnson, et al v. O'Brien, et al, the\nparties hereto further stipulate and agree as follows:\na.  The provisions of paragraph 2 of said Order con-\n^p  cerning the renovation of the confinement areas described\ntherein have been fully completed and counsel for\nplaintiffs are unaware of any respect in which defendants\nhave failed fully to comply with the provisions of said\nparagraph.\nb.  Paragraph 4 of the aforesaid Order requires the\ninstitution and maintenance of a recreation program as more\nfully described in said Order; with the exception of iso-\nlated periods of time in which said program has been\ninterrupted because of the mechanical failure of the eleva-\ntors, the requirements of reconstruction resulting from\nescape attempts, or other factors and/or conditions not\ndirectly within the control of defendants, plaintiffs'\nf\n-6-\n\n;  .  '  ,  •  '\ncounsel are unaware of any respect in which defendants have\nnot fully complied with the terms and provisions of said\nparagraph 4.\nc.  Paragraph 5 of the aforesaid Order requires the\ninstitution and maintenance of a medical program as fully\nset forth in said Order; defendants have at all times sub-\nsequent to the entry of said Order interpreted the word\n\"daily\" as used therein to mean \"week days\" (Monday through\nFriday) as contrasted with \"weekends\"; because of said\ninterpretation, the written medical request forms completed\nby residents are evaluated and reviewed by the L.P.N. on\nMondays through Fridays, and by senior supervisory staff in\nconsultation with the emergency room staff of St. Louis\nCounty Hospital on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; subject\nto the foregoing, plaintiffs' counsel are unaware of any\nsignificant manner in which defendants have not fully\ncomplied with the procedures set forth in paragraph 5 of\nthe aforesaid Order.\nd.  Paragraph 6 of the aforesaid Order requires the\ninstitution and on-going maintenance of a program with\nrespect to \"cleaning details\" within said facility; not-\nwithstanding the fact that isolated members of the class of\nplaintiffs have, from time to time asserted nonspecific\nalleged violations with respect to the terms and provisions\nof said paragraph, counsel for said plaintiffs state that\ntheir investigation has revealed no significant or substan-\n-7-\n\ntial intentional violations of the requirements of said\nsubparagraph.\ne.  Subparagraph 7 of the aforesaid Order requires\nthe institution and maintenance of a program with respect\nto laundering the personal apparel of residents; with the\nexception of isolated periods of time during which defen-\ndants have experienced a malfunction of equipment resulting\nin the temporary interruption of said program, counsel for\nplaintiffs are unaware of any substantial manner in which\ndefendants have failed to comply with the terms and provi-\nsions of said paragraph 7 of the aforesaid Order.\nf.  Paragraph 8 of the aforesaid Order requires the\ninstitution and maintenance of a visitation program with\nrespect to the residents of said institution; counsel for\nplaintiffs are unaware of any respect in which defendants\nhave failed to comply with the terms and provisions of the\naforesaid paragraph with respect to visitation.\n14.  The parties hereto therefore stipulate and agree that,\nsubject to the further order of this Court entered upon its own\nmotion or upon motion of the plaintiffs, the matters with\nrespect to the compliance of defendants with the Order of this\nCourt entered in Johnson, et al v. O'Brien, et al be consi-\ndered concluded and the file with respect thereto closed.\n15.  The issues presented by the pleadings in Bullington v.\nMoreland and as to which evidence, testimony and stipulations\nof the parties have been presented to the Court, are based upon\n-8-\n\n_  > the contentions of the class-action plaintiffs that their con-\nstitutional rights as pre-trial detainees are violated by\naction or inaction on the part of the defendants with respect\nto the following general areas or subject matters (as set forth\nin the Magistrate's REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION):\n(1)  Overcrowding by excess population.\n(2)  Cold food and inadequate portions thereof.\n(3)  Substandard medical-dental facilities.\n(4)  Lack of a serviceable library.\n(5)  Failure to provide prisoners with jail rules.\n(6)  Lack of cleanliness.\n(7)  Prisoner mail from courts and attorneys being\ncensored.\n(8)  Strip searches, especailly after visits.\n1  (9)  Antiquated visiting booths creating inadequate\ncommunication.\n(10)  Internal assaults.\n(11)  Lack of recreation.\n(12)  Length of pretrial detention.\n16.  Subsequent to the entry by this Court of the Order of\nSeptember 18, 1980 as aforesaid, counsel for the parties hereto\nseparately, and also with Magistrate Bahn, met and conferred on\nnumerous occasions for the purpose of discussing, clarifying\nand attempting to resolve the foregoing issues raised by plain-\ntiffs' Complaint and listed in the preceding paragraph; as the\nresult of the foregoing efforts, between September 18, 1980 and\nthe date of this Stipulation, numerous practices, procedures\nr\n-9-\n\n, and policies have been amended, promulgated, adopted, imple-\nT\n•  mented and/or maintained by defendants with respect to their\noperation of the St. Louis County Jail with the result that\nmany of the complaints of plaintiffs have been eliminated,\nrectified or resolved; for the purposes of continuity, and for\nthe convenience of the Court, the parties have listed as num-\nbered subparagraphs of paragraph 17, the corresponding 12\n\"general areas\" of plaintiffs' complaints alleged in the\nComplaint as categorized by the Honorable Magistrate in his\nReport (and as listed in paragraph 15 hereof), and as to each\ncategory, the parties have set forth the agreed facts with\nrespect to said category followed by an agreed statement of the\nproposed remedy with respect thereto which, upon approval by\n^--.  the Court, the parties agree may be incorporated in the Court's\nfinal Order; as to such categories wherein the parties agree\nupon the facts, but have not agreed upon the appropriate remedy\nor relief, if any, to be granted, the parties hereto stipulate\nand agree that said issues may be determined by the Court as\nhereinafter set forth in paragraph 21 hereof.\n17.  The complaints alleged in plaintiffs' Complaint, as\ncategorized by the Magistrate in his Report of July 23, 1981\nare as follows:\n1.  OVERCROWDING BY EXCESS POPULATION\n(a)  Statement of Stipulated Facts\nSt. Louis County Jail at Clayton, Missouri is operated\nas a \"maximum security\" institution; with the exception of\nr\n-10-\n\ntwo areas (one, the \"Intake Service Center\", a receiving\nand processing unit located on the ground floor of the \"old\ncourthouse building\", and the second, the \"recreation area\"\nlocated on the second floor of the same building), all\npersons confined in St. Louis County Jail are housed and\nmaintained at all times within the area on the fourth floor\nof the building (for the purposes of this action, the\nparties hereto do not include within the definition of\n\"persons confined in St. Louis County Jail\" such persons as\nmay be in the custody of defendants in the \"work release\nprogram\" under the terms of which persons are in the cus-\ntody of the defendants except for such periods of time as\nsuch person is released to work at an outside place of\nprivate employment; work release subjects are housed cus-\ntomarily in an area located on the third floor of the\ncourthouse); all persons coming into the custody of defen-\ndants are initially received at the \"Intake Service Center\"\n(ISC), and if said person is to be remaining in the custody\nof defendants for confinement either in the St. Louis\nCounty Jail or in the Adult Correctional Institution (ACI)\nat Gumbo, said person is in due course moved from the base-\nment of the building to the fourth floor facility of\nSt. Louis County Jail where the detainee is initially\nhoused in the so-called YELLOW ZONE or intake center.\n-11-\n\nYELLOW ZONE\n. The intake center consists of a unit of 12 cells plus\ntwo cells used for the temporary detention of female\nprisoners or other prisoners initially to be isolated from\nother residents, which two cells are separated from the\nremaining 12 cells; each of the 12 YELLOW ZONE cells is\napproximately 6 ft. X 9 ft. X 8 ft., thereby containing an\narea of approximately 54 sq. ft.; during the course of this\nlitigation, and as the result of stipulations of the\nparties, defendants have installed one additional fold-down\nbunk in each of the 12 cells so that at the present time\neach such cell has sleeping accomodations for two persons;\neach cell further is equipped with a toilet and a wash\nbasin; one separated shower stall serves all residents\nhoused in the YELLOW ZONE; the YELLOW ZONE is used for the\nhousing of residents first entering the system prior to\nclassification by the social service staff for assignment\nto a specific area in the main confinement area of the\njail; the area is further used to house persons who are\nawaiting transfer to ACI, for persons who defendants\nanticipate will make bond but have not yet completed the\nmechanical requirements, and occasionally for persons being\nheld without warrant under the so-called \"20 hour rule\";\npersons housed in the YELLOW ZONE normally do not remain\ntherein for more than 72 hours; for statistical purposes,\ndefendants do not include in their computations of total\n-12-\n\n•  number of inmates any of the persons confined within the\nYELLOW ZONE; during periods of maximum occupancy and\nbecause of circumstances beyond their control, defendants\nhave from time to time placed additional mattresses on the\nfloor of the cells in the YELLOW ZONE thereby increasing on\nsaid occasions the occupancy to three residents per cell;\nbased upon the standards set forth by the Eighth Circuit\nwith respect to minimum number of square feet per resident,\nthe cells in the YELLOW ZONE meet constitutional standards\nfor area at such times as the population thereof is limited\nto not more than two persons per cell,\n(b)  Proposed Remedy\nThe parties hereto stipulate and agree that no more\n/r-  than two persons shall be housed in each of the 12 cells\nlocated in the YELLOW ZONE of St. Louis County Jail, except\nthat, in the event of specific, unusual circumstances one\nadditional person may be placed in each of said cells pro-\nvided that none of the three persons so confined in said\ncell shall be maintained therein for any period of time in\nexcess of 18 consecutive hours.\nRED ZONE\nStatement of Stipulated Facts and Proposed Remedy\nThe cells in the RED ZONE, or main confinement area are the\ncells which were reconstructed in compliance with this Court's\nOrder in Johnson v. O'Brien, supra; the area and the popula-\ntion limits comport with minimum standards as set forth by the\nc\n-13-\n\nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the provisions contained in\nT\n*  the Order in Johnson v. O'Brien with respect thereto, may be,\nby the consent of the parties, ratified and reaffirmed in the\npresent Order.\nGREEN ZONE\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe GREEN ZONE consists of three cells each containing four\nbunks and each measuring 8 ft. X 14 ft. X 8 ft. (height), or\n112 sq. ft. per cell; the zone also includes an area commonly\nreferred to as a \"day room\" into which the three cells open;\nthe area of the day room contains 564 sq. ft.; except for the\ntime period between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m., the residents in the\nGREEN ZONE are not confined to their individual cell, but\n-—  rather are free to move about in all of the cells as well as in\nthe day room; to accommodate additional residents; bunks are\nfrom time to time set up in the day room for one or more addi-\ntional residents; residents housed in the GREEN ZONE normally\nare persons who do not present significant disciplinary\nproblems.\nProposed Remedy\nBased upon the minimum area standards set forth by the\nEighth Circuit, the parties stipulate and agree that occupancy\nof the GREEN ZONE shall be limited to four persons in each of\nthe three-man cells, and in addition thereto, additional resi-\ndents up to, but not exceeding, four (4) in number may, as\nnecessary, be housed in the day room of the GREEN ZONE, pro-\nIT\n-14-\n\nvi'de'd, however, that all residents housed in the GREEN ZONE\nT\n1  shall be permitted to move about in the day room a minimum of\n12 out of any 24 consecutive hour period (except in the event\nof specific objective unusual circumstances as determined by\ndefendants); defendants may, from time to time, petition this\nCourt for further orders with respect to any change in proce-\ndure with respect to confinement of residents within the GREEN\nZONE.\nNORTH MODULE\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe NORTH MODULE is composed of a common area containing\n530 sq. ft. on to which nine one-man doorless rooms open; each\nof the nine one-man rooms contains 58 sg. ft.; thus, the com-\n^ip  bined area of the NORTH MODULE is 1,052 ft.; toilet facilities\nare available only in each of the individual rooms, and there\nis a single shower facility in the common area.  The number of\nresidents housed in the NORTH MODULE in normal circumstances\nranges from nine to fifteen persons.\nProposed Remedy\nIn accordance with the minimum standards set forth by the\nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties stipulate and\nagree that not more than 14 residents be housed in the NORTH\nMODULE.\nT\n-15-\n\nT SOUTH  MODULE\n•  Statement of Stipulated Facts\nThe SOUTH MODULE consists of a common area containing 600\nsq.  ft. plus ten individual rooms opening onto the common area,\neach of which individual rooms contains approximately 52 sq.\nft. of area; thus, the total area is approximately 1,120 sq.\nft.; each of the individual rooms contains toilet facilities\nand there is a shower stall located in the common area. The\nnumber of residents housed in the SOUTH MODULE in normal cir-\ncumstances ranges from eight to fourteen persons.\nProposed Remedy\nIn accordance with the minimum standards set forth by the\nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties stipulate and\n.gp  agree that not more than 14 residents be housed in the SOUTH\nMODULE.\nCLOSE SECURITY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe CLOSE SECURITY area consists of five two-man cells,\neach of which measures 5 ft. X 9 ft X 8 ft. (height), or 45 sq.\nft. per cell; the five cells in the CLOSE SECURITY area open\nonto a day room containing 409 sq. ft.; prior to September,\n1982, on a rotating basis, the two persons in a respective cell\nwere permitted in the day room for one hour periods at a time,\nso that an individual confined in the CLOSE SECURITY area\nremained confined to his cell except for three (3) hours out of\nany 24 hour period during which he was permitted use of the day\nf\n-16-\n\nT room; subsequent to September, 1982, all ten residents of this\n*  area are permitted to use the day room between the hours of 7\na.m. and 10 p.m.\nProposed Remedy\nBased upon the minimum standards set forth by the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals, the parties agree that use of the\ncells in the CLOSE SECURITY area shall be restricted to not\nmore than one person per cell or a total of five residents,\nexcept that in situations of documented emergency beyond the\ncontrol of defendants, two persons may be confined in one or\nmore of each said five cells, so long as no individual resident\nshall be confined in any such cell in excess of seventy-two\nhours with another resident.\nISOLATION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThere are seven ISOLATION cells, each consisting of\napproximately 63 sq. ft. and each housing one resident.  The\nISOLATION cells are used for disciplinary purposes, for admin-\nistrative segregation, and for isolation of residents having\nemotional, psychological or severe medical problems.\nProposed Remedy\nBased upon the minimum standards set forth by the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals, the parties agree that the ISOLATION\ncells may be used for purpose of housing one resident per cell\nas is presently the practice.\n-17-\n\n• •  INFIRMARY\n\"  Statement of Stipulated Facts\nThe INFIRMARY consists of a segregated secure area contain-\ning approximately 158 sq. ft.; the area further contains toilet\nfacilities and a shower stall; the normal capacity of the area\nis three residents; on occasion a fourth bed is added to the\narea because of medical necessity.\nProposed Remedy\nBased upon the standards set forth by the Eighth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, the parties stipulate and agree that three\nresidents may be housed in the INFIRMARY, and that, from time\nto time, defendants may house an additional inmate in said area\nwhen, in the opinion of defendants, specific demonstrated addi-\njp-  tional need for INFIRMARY space is required in order to provide\nt\nfor the health, safety and security of the residents.\n2.  COLD FOOD AND INADEQUATE PORTIONS THEREOF\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nIndividual members of the class of plaintiffs have differ-\nent complaints concerning the food served in the institution;\nthe complaints range from,food being served cold, to a dislike\nfor specific vegetables; the menus are determined by qualified\ndietitians employed by St. Louis County and who physically work\nat St. Louis County Hospital; there is some evidence that some\nof the residents are unaccustomed to the balanced diets\nselected by the dietitians and served by the institution which\ncould form the basis for the complaints of some of the resi-\nf\n-18-\n\ndents; because of the crowded conditions and the fact that all\nmeals are delivered from the kitchen to the individual resi-\ndent's cell, there can, from time to time, be some delays or\ndifference in delivery time with respect to different areas of\nthe institution which accounts for the complaints with respect\nto cold food; at the time of the numerous inspections by coun-\nsel for defendants and by the Magistrate all items of \"hot\"\nfood appeared to be well within acceptable ranges of tempera-\nture for serving; the evidence with respect to this area of\nplaintiffs' Complaint is somewhat inconsistent, contradictory\nand nebulous, and it is difficult to conclude that the actions\nof defendants with respect to the food served in St. Louis\nCounty Jail fail to meet constitutional minimum standards.\nr\n3.  SUBSTANDARD MEDICAL-DENTAL FACILITY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe Order of the Court in the Johnson v. O'Brien case\nremains in effect, and said Order is being met by defendants\nwith respect to medical procedures; the licensed practical\nnurse visits each custody area of the institution at approxi-\nmately 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and receives the written\nmedical complaints submitted by the residents; on Saturday,\nSunday and holidays, the written complaints are reviewed by\nsenior staff members who then consult with the emergency room\nat St. Louis County Hospital with respect to any complaints\nreceived by them which are believed to require review by\nmedically trained personnel; a medical doctor visits the Jail\nr\n-19-\n\non Monday, Wednesday and Friday and a psychiatrist and/or\npsychologist is available on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays;\nsubsequent to the institution of this action and to the Order\nentered in the Johnson case, the defendants established a\ngeneral dental therapy facility at the Adult Correctional\nInstitution at Gumbo; at the present time residents of\nSt. Louis County Jail with dental problems are transported to\nGumbo for treatment of their dental needs; at the present time,\nboth licensed practical nurses work Monday through Friday for\nthe same eight hour shift; the parties agree that the medical\nneeds of the residents cannot be adequately supplied during a\nsingle eight hour period.\nProposed Remedy\nThe parties hereby stipulate and agree that that portion of\nthis Court's Order in Johnson v. O'Brien be reaffirmed with\nrespect to the maintenance of the medical program with the\nfollowing clarification and addition; the written forms\ndescribed in paragraph 5 of the Order in the Johnson case\nshall be reviewed by a licensed practical nurse on duty at the\nJail who shall visit each detention area and attend to each\ninmate who has previously indicated a desire for medical atten-\ntion; such shall be done Monday through Friday, inclusive; on\nSaturday, Sunday and legal holidays, a senior member of the\nstaff shall visit each detention area and attend to each inmate\nwho has previously indicated a desire for medical attention;\nsuch senior staff person shall then communicate with qualified\n-20-\n•  r\n\npersonnel at St. Louis County Hospital for the purpose of\ndetermining whether or not any resident is in need of further\nimmediate medical attention; as to any such inmate who is\ndetermined by the staff at St. Louis County Hospital to be in\nneed of immediate medical attention, defendant shall forthwith\ntransport said inmate to St. Louis County Hospital for the pur-\npose of receiving such medical attention; further, defendants\nshall employ licensed practical nurses assigned to St. Louis\nCounty Jail and shall cause their schedules to be such that on\nMonday through Friday there shall be one or more such licensed\npractical nurse on duty at the jail at least 16 of the 24 hours\nof the day.\n4.  LACK OF A SERVICEABLE LIBRARY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe defendants presently provide selected legal materials\nfor use by the residents; a library containing adequate legal\nmaterials both satisfies the residents' constitutional right to\naccess to the Courts and also provides the detainees with an\nopportunity to occupy their time in a useful and pacific\nendeavor; the materials of a legal nature currently available\nin the Jail library are useful to the residents for the above\npurposes but are not totally adequate and the contents of the\nlibrary with respect to legal materials should be increased.\nProposed Remedy\nThe following listed materials, at a minimum, shall be\nsupplied by defendants as and for a library at St. Louis County\n-21-\n\nJail to be used by the inmates in accordance with such reason-\nable rules concerning the use thereof as may be, from time to\ntime, promulgated and enforced by the defendants:\n1.  An adequate supply of legal size stationery;\n2.  Two manual typewriters in good working order;\n3.  Volumes 38, 39, 40 and 41 of VAMS;\n4.  Missouri Rules of Court pamphlets;\n5.  Vernons Annotated Missouri Rules (Rules 1-102 in four\nvolumes);\n6.  Southwestern Reporter - Missouri cases only (last ten\nyears to date);\n7.  Blacks Law Dictionary;\n8.  Missouri Digest (one set);\n9.  Titles 18 and 28 United States Code Annotated;\n10.  Federal Practice and Procedure by Wright and Miller,\nVolumes 1-3 only;\n11.  Supreme Court Reporter (1953 to date);\n12.  Corpus Jurus Secundum - criminal law sections only (7\nvolumes);\n13.  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures pamphlets; and\n14.  Missouri Revised Statutes plus yearly supplements\n(1978 Edition).\n5.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRISONERS WITH JAIL RULES\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nPrior to the institution of this action, defendants had\ndiscontinued a prior practice of distributing printed rules to\nresidents upon their entry into the institution; during the\ncourse of these proceedings, by stipulation, it was agreed that\nrules would be revised, submitted to counsel for plaintiffs for\n-22-\n\nsuggestion, comment and criticism, and then promulgated,\nf\nprinted.and distributed to the residents; this stipulation has\nbeen completed and at the present time written rules and regu-\nlations are provided to each person entering the St. Louis\nCounty Jail; a copy of said rules and regulations marked\nplaintiffs' Exhibit 22 has been filed with the Court.\nProposed Remedy\nDefendants shall furnish to each person entering St. Louis\nCounty Jail a written or otherwise printed copy of the rules\nand regulations of said institution, which are currently pro-\nmulgated in the form evidenced by Exhibit 22; defendants shall,\nfrom time to time, when deemed necessary, review, revise and\nreprint said rules and regulations; nothing in this Order shall\nAT-  be deemed in any wise to restrict the right of defendants to\nestablish, promulgate and distribute any and all reasonable\nrules and regulations with respect to the operation of St. Louis\nCounty Jail so long as said rules and regulations meet all con-\nstitutional tests, are not inconsistent with existing orders of\nthis Court, and are published and distributed to the residents\nupon entry into the institution.\n6.  LACK OF CLEANLINESS\nStatement of Stipulated Facts and Proposed Remedy\nDefendants are in compliance with the Order of this Court\nwith respect to the cleaning of the residents' areas and the\nlaundry of personal articles as set forth in the Court's Order\nin Johnson v. O'Brien and said Order is reaffirmed and\n/#\"\"  ratified.\n-23-\n\n7.  INMATE MAIL FROM COURTS AND ATTORNEYS AND CENSORSHIP\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nIndividual members of plaintiff class complained that in-\ncoming mail bearing the return address of a court or an attor-\nney at law was censored by institutional staff prior to\ndelivery to residents; the rules promulgated by defendants\nduring the course of this litigation include specific provi-\nsions with respect to receipt of mail from courts or attorneys\nand compliance with said Rules fully eliminates plaintiffs'\ncomplaints.\nProposed Remedy\nDefendants shall at all times carry out the provisions of\ndefendants' rule with respect to \"mail\" set forth on page 9 of\nthe current rules of the institution which provides in part:\n\"Any letter from your attorney, judge or governmental official\nwill be delivered to you unopened.\"; any such mail from an\nattorney, judge, government official, or the like delivered in\nan unopened condition by the staff of St. Louis County Jail\nmay, upon direction from a member of the staff be required to\nbe opened by the resident in the presence of a member of the\nstaff who shall have the right to inspect the contents of said\nenvelope for contraband material, but he shall not read any\nwritten material contained in said envelope.\n-24-\n\n8.  STRIP SEARCHES AFTER VISITS\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nPrior to the institution of this action, inmates were rou-\ntinely subjected to a \"strip search\" in connection with said\ninmates receiving a visit in accordance with the rules of the\ninstitution; all visits are \"secure visits\" in which no contact\neither by way of person or objects is permitted between the\nresident and the visitor, and thus in most circumstances, said\nstrip searches may be considered unnecessary to preserve the\n\"maximum security\" character of the institution; in unusual\ncircumstances or for specific reasons strip searches of inmates\nin connection with visitation may be deemed to be reasonable\nand necessary.\nProposed Remedy\nIt is agreed that inmates shall not be subject to routine\n\"strip searches\" in connection with the exercise of their visi-\ntation privileges; however, in the event a senior member of the\nstaff of St. Louis County Jail has reasonable grounds to be-\nlieve that a strip search is necessary in connection with a\nspecific visitation, a strip search of a resident in connection\nwith a visitation may be required.\n9.  ANTIQUATED VISITING BOOTHS\nCREATING INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nAs indicated previously in this Stipulation, all visita-\ntions in St. Louis County Jail are \"secure\" visits; in connec-\ntion therewith, each of the visiting booths is equipped with a\n-25-\n\nr\nr\n\nmechanism  which  is designed  to permit  the passage  of  sound\n\"**  between.the  resident  and his  visitor  while  at  the  same  time\ntotally  prohibiting  the passage  of  any  object  between  said\npersons;  because,  from  time  to  time, unknown persons  have\nattempted  to tamper with  said device,  repairs  have  been  made\nthereto  which  somewhat  inhibit  the passage  of  sound  in  an\nappropriate  manner;  defendants  have  agreed  that profit  made\nfrom  the  sale  of  sundry  items  to  the  residents  could be  made\navailable  for  the purchase  of equipment  for  telephonic  communi-\ncations between  resident  and visitor  thereby  eliminating  the\nneed  for the  aforesaid  devices,  and  thus permit  the  removal\nthereof  while  at the  same  time  improving  communications  between\nresident  and  visitor.\n4T-  Proposed  Remedy\nDefendant  shall prepare  a plan  for  the  installation  of\ntelephonic  communication  devices  for the visiting  booths  in\nSt.  Louis County  Jail  to  replace  the present  device  used  to\ntransmit  the  sound between visitor  and  resident;  said  plan\nshall provide  for the  installation  of  said  devices  on  a\nstaggered  basis based  upon  receipt  of  available  funds  from\nanticipated  profit  from  the  sale  of merchandise  in  the\ncommissary.\n10.  INTERNAL  ASSAULTS\nStatement  of  Stipulated  Facts\nPlaintiffs  submitted  evidence  of  specific  internal  assaults\nwhich  are  defined by  the parties  as  assaults by  one  inmate  upon\n-26-\n\nanother; investigation by counsel for plaintiffs and by repre-\nsentatives of defendants have independently revealed evidence\nof other instances of internal assault; however, in the over-\nwhelming number of specific cases, the victim of the assault,\nfor various reasons, either refuses to testify concerning said\nmatters or is reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement\nofficials, with the result that successful prosecution (either\ncriminally or administratively) is essentially impossible; upon\nreceipt by defendants of any complaint from a resident with\nrespect to internal assaults, both internal procedures are\nundertaken and a report is made with the Clayton Police Depart-\nment; said department responds, interviews the complainant and\nmakes a report thereof; actual criminal prosecution of said\nmatters is not within the jurisdiction of defendants and defen-\ndants cooperate with appropriate authorities in the event of\nthe institution of criminal proceedings; within the limitations\nof the design of the confinement areas of the present St. Louis\nCounty Jail meaningful increased observation of residents in an\neffort to reduce potential internal assaults is impractical and\ncould not reasonably be expected to result in any reduction\nthereof; the correctional officers assigned to the respective\nareas of the institution must be vigilant to guard against the\nopportunity for said assaults.\n-27-\n\n11.  LACK OF RECREATION\n•  Statement of Stipulated Facts\nThe Order of the Court in Johnson v. O'Brien with respect\nto recreational facilities is being met by defendants; the\nrecreational area has been altered and the facilities presently\ninclude bar bells, strength testing devices, weight machines,\nfoosball machines, punching bags, handball court and facilities\nfor basketball; the program is operated from approximately  8:00\na.m. until midnight and each inmate is given the opportunity\nfor use of the facilities in accordance with the previous\nOrder; counsel for plaintiffs are unaware of any significant or\nsubstantial complaints from any of the plaintiffs with respect\nto the operation and use of the recreational program; the\n^gr—  present program has inmate acceptance and should be continued.\n12.  LENGTH OF PRETRIAL DETENTION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nWith minor exceptions caused by unusual isolated circum-\nstances, the facility operated by defendants on the fourth\nfloor and known as St. Louis County Jail is used for the\ndetention of male persons on one of the following basis:  (a)\ndetained in a pretrial status and charged with a crime against\nthe person such as murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping or\nthe like or (b) held in custody on a writ issued by a Court\nrequiring the production of a person previously committed to\nthe custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections, whose\npresence is required in St. Louis County in connection with\nf\n-28-\n\nseme*judicial proceeding or (c) a person in custody awaiting\nhearing.on a petition for the revocation of probation or parole\nor (d) a minor certified under the provision of the Juvenile\nCode for trial as an adult.  Each of said persons is committed\nto the custody of defendants pursuant to an order issued by an\nappropriate Court; the defendants in this action have no dis-\ncretion as to whether or not, or upon what terms any resident\nis released from custody; because of the nature of the charges\nfor which pretrial detainees are held in St. Louis County Jail,\nto-wit a felony, each inmate is represented by an attorney at\nlaw, retained by him or by the public defender; questions with\nrespect to reduction in bond or release on the resident's own\nrecognizance are matters which must be submitted to a Court for\n^  determination and counsel for said residents, and not defen-\ndants are the appropriate persons to submit said motions to the\nCourt; the defendants in the present action are not personally\ncapable of exercising control over the length of time between\nthe institution of a charge against a member of the class and\nthe date on which judicial resolution of said charge is\nreached; the question of excessive pretrial detention and any\nrelief to which a person may be entitled as the result thereof,\nare more appropriately presented to a Court by a member of the\nclass of plaintiffs in said person's criminal action than as\nclaims against the present defendants in this action.\n18.  In addition to the foregoing 12 areas of complaints as\ncatagorized by the Honorable Magistrate in his Review and\n-29-\n\nT Recbmmendation, plaintiffs presented evidence concerning the\nmanner in which residents aged 16 and under are housed in\nSt. Louis County Jail; upon entry of an Order by the Judge of\nthe Juvenile Division, certifying that an individual is to be\nproceeded against as an adult, custody of the subject is relin-\nquished by the Juvenile Court and, if warrants are issued by\nthe prosecuting attorney, the subject is forthwith transferred\nto the St. Louis County Jail; the number of certified juveniles\nmaintained in St. Louis County Jail varies from time to time;\non March 9, 1981 eight certified juveniles 16 years of age or\nunder were residents of St. Louis County Jail; more recently as\nfew as three certified juveniles were residents of St. Louis\nCounty Jail; at such time as there are appropriate numbers of\nMK>  certified juveniles, either the SOUTH MODULE or the CLOSE\nSECURITY areas, respectively, were used by the defendants for\nthe housing of certified juveniles so that in such circum-\nstances the certified juveniles were segregated from other\nresidents to the greatest extent possible while still residing\nwithin the confines of the jail; both the Statutes of Missouri,\n211.151(4), and 211.331(2) R.S.Mo. 1978 and the Rules promul-\ngated by the defendants (see Exhibit 22, page 49, paragraph 3)\nprohibit the housing of certified juveniles in such circum-\nstances as they are either housed or mingled with adult\nprisoners; the Supreme Court of Missouri in State v. Kemper,\nMo. App. 1975 535 S.W. 2d 241, held that it is a violation of\nMissouri statute to house certified juveniles in such circum-\n-30-\n\nT stances as they came into contact with adult prisoners; all\n*  parties.to this action stipulate and agree that any and all\npersons under the age of seventeen years certified by the\nJuvenile Court to be prosecuted under the general existing law\nas adults must be housed in such a manner as totally to segre-\ngate them from all other adult detainees.\nProposed Remedy\nThe parties stipulate and agree that on such occasions as\nany person 16 years of age or under is detained by defendants,\nsaid person shall be kept in an area totally segregated from\nall persons aged 17 or over; in such circumstances as persons\n16 years of age or under are maintained by defendants in\nSt. Louis County Jail not only shall all such persons be housed\nC\nin an area separate and apart from other inmates but also said\njuveniles shall not be fed, given recreation, toilet and/or\nshowering facilities or in any other manner permitted to come\ninto contact or associate with any detainee aged 17 or over.\n19.  Counsel for plaintiffs in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and\nCause No. 76-210 C (2) are not counsel for plaintiff in Cause\nNo. 82-223 C (4), William J. Bruce, Plaintiff, v. St. Louis\nCounty Department of Justice Services, Inc. which action was,\nas heretofore indicated, consolidated into this action by order\nof Judge William L. Hungate; the parties hereto, however,\nstipulate and agree that the Complaint filed, pro se by plain-\ntiff in that action alleges that plaintiff was at the time of\nthe filing thereof a pretrial detainee resident of St. Louis\nf  •  •\n-31-\n\n'. •  .\nC County Jail; by his Complaint, plaintiff Bruce seeks an order\npermitting said plaintiff to have \"contact\" visits with visi-\ntors; said \"contact\" visits, presumably being defined as a\nvisitation between a resident of the jail and a visitor, in\nwhich the resident and the visitor are permitted to touch or\notherwise physically come into contact with each other; plain-\ntiff seeks no relief by way of money judgment against defen-\ndants in said action; the parties hereto state and represent to\nthe Court that on or about March 13, 1981 William J. Bruce was\nadmitted as a resident of St. Louis County Jail on charges of\nforcible rape and kidnapping on warrants issued by the State of\nMissouri; at said time defendants herein further were in\npossession of detainers from the states of Indiana and Kentucky\nC with respect to plaintiff Bruce; on or about April 15, 1982\nWilliam J. Bruce left the custody of defendants herein and was\ntransported to the Department of Corrections of the State of\nMissouri in Jefferson City, Missouri on a commitment and sen-\ntence of 50 years to said Department; at no time subsequent to\nApril 15, 1982 has plaintiff Bruce been in the custody of\ndefendants in St. Louis County Jail; counsel for defendants in\nthis action state to the Court that any and all complaints\nand/or claims of plaintiff Bruce are included within the\nmatters before this Court in the allegations of the class\naction in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and that any and all relief to\nwhich plaintiff Bruce is or may be entitled should be included\nwithin the final Order entered by this Court in said action No.\nf\n-32-\n\nC 79-650 C (2); counsel for defendants further state that the\nindividual action filed by Mr. Bruce not only should be consi-\ndered included within the aforesaid class action, but also any\nsuch claims have been rendered moot by the removal of said\nplaintiff Bruce from custody of defendants on or about April\n15, 1982; counsel for plaintiffs in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and\n76-210 C (2) state that the plaintiffs in said actions have not\nand do not take the position that the residents in St. Louis\nCounty Jail have an unqualified constitutional right to contact\nvisits.\n20.  The counsel for plaintiffs in this action have made\nclaim against defendants for allowance of attorneys' fees and\nexpenses incurred in representing the members of the class in\n/•\"*  this action; the parties hereto stipulate and agree that coun-\nsel for plaintiffs shall within the time period directed by the\nCourt file with the Court their verified Motion for Allowance\nof Attorneys' Fees together with Affidavits in support thereof\nand that upon receipt of copies thereof by counsel for defen-\ndants, defendants may have such time thereafter as may be set\nby the Court within which to file defendants' Suggestions in\nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees; the\nparties hereto stipulate and agree that said claims for attor-\nneys' fees may be submitted to the Court for consideration and\ndetermination in the foregoing manner in lieu of presentation\nof testimony and evidence to the Court.\n-33-\n\nzl.

DISTRICT OF MO\n)  Cause  No.  79-650-C(2)\nWARDEN  MORELAND,  et al.,  )\n)\nDefendants.  )\nDEFENDANTS' OBJECTIONS TO REVIEW AND\nRECOMMENDATION OF MAGISTRATE\nCome now Defendants by and through their attorneys of record,\nand state that they have no objection to the U. S. Magistrate's\nReview and Recommendation dated July 23, 1981, except in the\nfollowing particulars:\nOVERCROWDING\nThe recommendations set forth in the Magistrate's Review and\nRecommendation have been implemented as of August 3, 1981.  As a\nmatter of law, the County Jail facility is not overcrowded by\nexcess population so as to be violative of the Eighth or\nFourteenth Amendments.\nThe conditions at the County Jail facility, as modified do\nnot constitute a violation of Plaintiffs' civil rights. The\nCounty Jail facility conditions do not involve wanton or\nunnecessary infliction of pain.  See Rhodes v. Chapman,  , U.S.\n,  , S.Ct.  ,  LEd 2  , 41 CCHS.Ct.Bull. p.B3183.  That\nCourt noted at B318 4,:\n\"To the extent that such (jail) conditions are\nrestrictive and even harsh, they are part of the\npenalty that the criminal offenders pay for their\noffenses against society.\"\nLIBRARY\nThe Magistrate's Review and Recommendation regarding the\nCounty Jail facility library are contrary to law and the evidence\nherein, and should be set aside.  The investigating Magistrate has\nr\n\nrecommended that Defendants furnish inmates a library which\ncomports with the requirements set out in Tyler v. Satz,\nNo. 77-918-C(l) (E.D.Mo., 1978).\nAll inmates and pretrial detainees who are indigent have a\nstatutory right to have representation and defense provided by\ncounsel pursuant to Section 600.010 et seq., RSMo., 1978 as\namended, 41 VAMS 1980 p.p. 25-27.\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Noorland v. Ciccone,\n489 F2d. 642 (8th Cir. , 1973) considering the issue of an inmate's\nrights to an adequate law library, held that:\n\"...Under Johnson v. Avery [393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct.\n747 2LEd. 718 (1969)]...the Government need not\nfurnish every means of access to the Courts.  It\nneed only provide some opportunity for a prisoner\nto gain equal access to the Courts.  Thus, if the\npublic defender program at the Medical Center is\neffectual, the Government has met its burden under\nJohnson v. Avery regardless of any concomitant\nright to represent oneself in habeas proceedings.\nSee Adam v. United States 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63\nS.Ct. 236, 87 LEd. 268. ...\"\nThe Supreme Court in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 52 LEd.2d\n72 (1977) addressed the question of whether a state has an\naffirmative federal, constitutional duty to furnish prison inmates\nwith extensive law libraries or alternatively, to provide inmates\nwith professional or quasi-professional legal assistance.  That\nCourt held that adequate law libraries are only one\nconstitutionally acceptable method to assure meaningful access to\nthe Courts.  Bounds supra, at 1499.  The Court further noted the\nuse of full time staff attorneys as part of the public defender's\noffice not only result in more efficient and skillful handling of\nprisoners' cases, but avoid the disciplinary problem associated\nwith writ writers.  Bounds supra, at 1500.\nTherefore, it is clear that the St. Louis County and the\nState of Missouri, through the State mandated public defender\nsystem available to the County Jail facility inmates, has met the\nconsitutional requirements for providing inmates meaningful access\nto the Courts.\n\nWHEREFORE, Defendants move this Court to set aside the\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the\ninvestigating Magistrate's Report and Recommendation as they\nrelate to the \"Library\" and for the Court to take such action on\nthe objection and response of Defendants to \"Overcrowding\" as may\nbe proper.\nTHOMAS W.

On or about December 11, 1980 an Order was entered by\nMagistrate Bahn by which plaintiffs were directed to submit to\nthe Magistrate a listing of the action required to be taken by\ndefendants as set forth in the Order of this Court in Johnson\nv. O'Brien, and further directing plaintiffs' counsel to file\na listing of the complaints and allegations of the class with\nrespect to the issues raised in the present action, and further\nordering the defendants to indicate to the Court the nature of\nthe actions which have been taken by them in order to comply\nwith the Court's order in Johnson v. O'Brien.\n5.  Plaintiffs and defendants, respectively, filed their\nCertificate of Compliance with the Court's Order of December\n11, 1980, and Magistrate Bahn, in due course, both by means of\na personal examination and inspection of the St. Louis County\nJail and based upon the reports of the parties with respect\n-3-\n\nThere was neither claim nor proof of widespread\ninternal assault.  It would appear that the defendant\nis doing all possible, considering the cramped facilities,\nto minimize internal assault.  The jailer has an active\nclassification process, which should be maintained.\nWhen an assault rarely occurs, the defendant is quick\nto call the local police authorities, who interview\nthe complainant and make a report thereon.  Actual criminal\n•prosecution is then in the hands of the local prosecuting\nattorney and not within the jurisdiction of the defendant.\nOf course, this does not relieve the jailer of doing\nhis utmost to classify and protect the detainees.  However,\nit would appear that the complaints are extremely isolated\nand that all reasonably possible is being done to obviate\nviolence.  Absent constitutional violations, courts\ndefer to local jail administrators to protect  fundamental\nrights of prisoners.  Campbell v. Cauthron, supra.  The\nreviewing Magistrate makes no recommendation as to additional\norders in this direction.\nLENGTH OF PRETRIAL DETENTION\nPrisoners in the St. Louis County Jail are\nbasically there to await trial on criminal charges,\nor in answer to a writ issued by the Circuit Court of\nSt. Louis County.  As such, the detainees are committed •\nto the county jailer, who has no control over the length\nof time of incarceration.  The jailer simply awaits judicial\n-4-\n\nFed. R. Civ.

The parties stipulate and agree that Plaintiffs'\nExhibit 21, generally referred to as the Feasibility Report for\nExpansion St. Louis County Government Center prepared by Pearce\nCorporation and transmitted to the County Executive and to the\nmembers of the St. Louis County Council by letter of transmit-\ntal of March 19, 1981 be received in evidence in this case\n(with respect to such parts of said Exhibit as relate to the\nSt. Louis County Jail located in the Courthouse complex in\nClayton, Missouri); the parties hereto further stipulate and\nagree that all of the factual statements contained in said\nExhibit 21 with respect to said County Jail are true and\naccurate and that all of the statements of opinion contained in\n-5-\n\nsaid Exhibit are the opinions of those persons associated with\nthe Pearce Corporation whose names appear within said report,\nand that the said parsons making said report 'are, by training,\nexperience, education and profession, qualified to state the\nopinions expressed therein by said persons.\n13.

The\nnumber of residents  housed in the SOUTH  MODULE in normal cir-\ncumstances  ranges  from  eight to fourteen  persons.\nProposed  Remedy\nIn  accordance  with the minimum  standards  set forth by the\nEighth  Circuit  Court of Appeals, the parties  stipulate and\nagree  that not more  than 14 residents be housed  in the SOUTH\nMODULE.\nCLOSE SECURITY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe CLOSE SECURITY area consists of five two-man cells,\neach of which measures 5 ft. X 9 ft X 8 £t. (height), or 45 sq.\nft.  per cell; the five cells in the CLOSE SECURITY area open\nonto a day room containing 409 sq. ft.; prior to September,\n1982,  on a rotating basis, \"the two persons in a respective cell\nwere permitted in the day room for one hour periods at a time,\nso that an individual confined in the CLOSE SECURITY area\nremained confined to his cell except for three (3) hours out of\nany 24 hour period during which he was permitted use of the day\n-16-\n\nroom; subsequent to September, 1982, all ten residents of this\narea are permitted to use the day room between the hours of 7\na.m. and 10 p.m.\nProposed Remedy\nBased upon the minimum standards set forth by the Eighth\n:' '''  ' ' >  -\nCircuit Court of Appeals,' the parties agree that use of the\ncells in the CLOSE SECURITY area shall be restricted to not\nmore than one person per cell or a total of five residents,\nexcept that in situations of documented emergency beyond the\ncontrol of defendants, two persons may be confined in one or\nmore of each said five cells, so long as no individual resident\nshall be confined in any such cell in excess of seventy-two\nhours with another resident.\nISOLATION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThere are seven ISOLATION cells, each consisting of\napproximately 63 sq. ft. and each housing one resident.  The\nISOLATION cells are used for disciplinary purposes, for admin-\nistrative segregation, and for isolation\" of residents having\nemotional, psychological or severe medical problems.\nProposed Remedy\nEased upon the minimum standards set forth by the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals, the parties agree that the ISOLATION\ncells may be used for purpose of housing one resident per cell\nas is presently the practice.\n-17-\n\nINFIRMARY\n;  Statement of Stipulated Facts\nThe INFIRMARY consists of a segregated secure area contain-\ning approximately 158 sq. ft.; the area further contains toilet\nfacilities and a shower stall; the normal capacity of the area\nis three residents; on occasion a fourth bed is added to the\narea because of medical necessity.\nProposed Remedy  v,   '\n v\nBased upon the sta••'.n  d•ards set forth by the Eighth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, the parties stipulate and agree that three\nresidents may be housed in the INFIRMARY, and that, from time\n• to time, defendants may house an additional inmate in said area\nwhen, in the opinion of defendants, specific demonstrated addi-\ntional need for INFIRMARY space is required in order to provide\nfor the health, safety and security of the residents.\n2.  COLD FOOD AND INADEQUATE PORTIONS THEREOF\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nIndividual members of the class of plaintiffs have differ-\nent complaints concerning the food served in the institution;\nthe complaints range from .food being served cold, to a dislike\nfor specific vegetables; the menus are determined by qualified\ndietitians employed by St. Louis County and who physically work\nat St. Louis County Hospital; there is some evidence that some\nof the residents are unaccustomed to the balanced diets\nselected by the dietitians and served by the institution which\ncould form the basis for the complaints of some of the resi-\n-18-\n\n,' dents; because of the crowded conditions and the fact that all\n', weals are delivered from the kitchen to the individual resi-\ndent's cell, there can, from time to time, be some delays or\ndifference in delivery time with respect to different areas of\nthe institution which accounts for the complaints with respect\nto cold food; at the time of the numerous inspections by coun-\nsel for defendants and by the Magistrate all items of \"hot\"\nfood appeared to be well within acceptable ranges of tempera-\nture for serving; the evidence with respect to this area of\nplaintiffs' Complaint is somewhat inconsistent, contradictory\nand nebulous, and it is difficult to conclude that the actions\nof defendants with respect to the food served in St. Louis\nCounty Jail fail to meet constitutional minimum standards.\n3.  SUBSTANDARD MEDICAL-DENTAL FACILITY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe Order of the Court in the Johnson v. O'Brien case\nremains in effect, and said Order is being met by defendants\nwith respect to medical procedures; the licensed practical\nnurse visits each custody area of the institution at approxi-\nmately 9:00 a.m. Monday^through Friday and receives the written\nmedical complaints submitted by the residents; on Saturday,\nSunday and holidays, the written complaints are reviewed by\nsenior staff members who then consult with the emergency room\nat St. Louis County Hospital with respect to any complaints -\nreceived by them which are believed to require review by\n;  medically trained personnel; a medical doctor visits the Jail\n-19-\n\non Monday, Wednesday and Friday and a psychiatrist and/or\npsychologist is available on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays;\nsubse^ent to the institution of this action and to the Order\n ;\nentered in the Johnson case, the defendants established a\ngeneral dental therapy facility at the Adult Correctional\nInstitution at Gumbo; at the present time residents of\nSt. Louis County Jail,with dental problems are transported to\nGumbo for treatment of their dental needs; at the present time,\nboth licensed practical nurses work Monday through Friday for\nthe same eight hour shift; the parties agree that the medical\nneeds of the residents cannot be adequately supplied during a\nsingle eight hour period.\nProposed Remedy\nThe parties hereby stipulate and agree that that portion of\nthis Court's Order in Johnson v. O'Brien be reaffirmed with\nrespect to the maintenance of the medical program with the\nfollowing clarification and addition; the written forms\ndescribed in paragraph 5 of the Order in the Johnson case\nshall be reviewed by a licensed practical nurse on duty at the\nJail who shall visit each detention area and attend to each\ninmate who has previously indicated a desire for medical atten-\ntion; such shall be done Monday through Friday, inclusive; on\nSaturday, Sunday and legal holidays, a senior member of the\nstaff Bhall visit each detention area and attend to each inmate\nwho has previously indicated a desire for medical attention;\nsuch senior staff person shall then communicate with qualified\n-20-\n\npersonnel at St. Louis County Hospital for the purpose of\ndetermining whether or not any resident is in need of further\nimmediate medical attention; as to any such inmate who is\ndetermined by the staff at St. Louis County Hospital to be in\nneed of immediate medical attention, defendant shall forthwith\ntransport said inmate to St. Louis County Hospital for the pur-\npose of receiving Buch medical attention; further, defendants\nshall employ licensed practical nurses assigned to St. Louis\nCounty Jail and shall cause their schedules to be such that on\nMonday through Friday there shall be one or more such licensed\npractical nurse on duty at the jail at least 16 of the 24 hours\nof the day.\n4.  LACK OF A SERVICEABLE LIBRARY\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe defendants presently provide selected legal materials\nfor use by the residents; a library containing adequate legal\nmaterials both satisfies the residents' constitutional right to\naccess to the Courts and also provides the detainees with an\nopportunity to occupy their time in a useful and pacific\nendeavor; the materials of a legal nature currently available\nin the Jail'library are useful to the residents for the above\npurposes but are not totally adequate and the contents of the\nlibrary with respect to legal materials should be increased.\nProposed Remedy\nThe following listed materials, at a minimum, shall be\nsupplied by defendants as and for a library at St. Louis County\n-21-\n\nJail to be used by the inmates in accordance with such reason-\nable rules concerning the use thereof as may be, from time to\ntime, promulgated and enforced by the defendants:\n1.

FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRISONERS WITH JAIL RULES\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nPrior to the institution of this action, defendants had\ndiscontinued a prior practice of distributing printed rules to\nresidents upon their entry into the institution; during the\ncourse of these proceedings, by stipulation, it was agreed that\nrules would be revised, submitted to counsel for plaintiffs for\n-22-\n\nsuggestion, comment and criticism, and then promulgated,\nprinted and distributed to the residents; this stipulation has\nbeen completed and at the present time written rules and regu-\nlations are provided to each person entering the St. Louis\nCounty Jail; a copy of said rules and regulations marked\nplaintiffs' Exhibit 22 has been filed with the Court.\nProposed Remedy\nDefendants shall furnish to each person entering St. Louis\nCounty Jail a written,or otherwise printed copy of the rules\nand regulations of said institution, which are currently pro-\nmulgated in the form evidenced by Exhibit 22; defendants shall,\nfrom time to time, when deemed necessary, review, revise and\nreprint said rules and regulations; nothing in this Order shall\nbe deemed in any vise to restrict the right of defendants to\nestablish, promulgate and distribute any and all reasonable\nrules and regulations with respect to the operation of St. Louis\nCounty Jail so long as said rules and regulations meet all con-\nstitutional tests, are not inconsistent with existing orders of\nthis Court, and are published and distributed to the residents\nupon entry into the institution.\n6.  LACK OF CLEANLINESS\nStatement of Stipulated Facts and Proposed Remedy\nDefendants are in compliance.with the Order of this Court\nwith respect to the cleaning of the residents' areas and the\nlaundry of personal articles as set forth in the Court's Order\nin Johnson v. O'Brien and said Order is reaffirmed and\nratified.'\n-23-\n\n7.  INMATE MAIL FROM COURTS AMD ATTORNEYS AND CENSORSHIP\nStatement of Stipulated Facts   :\n  N\nIndividual members of plaintiff class complained that in-\ncoming mail bearing the return address of a court or an attor-\nney at law was censored by institutional staff prior to\ndelivery to residents; the rules promulgated by defendants\nduring the'course of this litigation include specific provi-\nsions with respect to receipt of mail from courts or attorneys\nand compliance with said Rules fully eliminates plaintiffs'\ncomplaints.\nProposed Remedy\nDefendants shall at all times carry out the provisions of\ndefendants' rule with respect to \"mail\" set forth on page 9 of\nthe current rules of the institution which provides in part:\n\"Any letter from your attorney, judge or governmental official\nwill be delivered to you unopened.\"; any such mail from an\nattorney, judge, government official, or the like delivered in\nan unopened condition by the staff of St. Louis County Jail\nmay, upon direction from a member of the staff be required tc\nbe opened by the resident in the presence of a member of the\nstaff who shall have the right to inspect the contents of said\nenvelope for contraband material, but he shall not read any\nwritten material contained in said envelope.\n-24-\n\n8.  STRIP SEARCHES AFTER VISITS\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nPrior to the institution of this action, inmates were rou-\ntinely subjected to a,\"strip search\" in connection with said\ninmates receiving a visit in accordance with the rules of the\ninstitution; all visits are \"secure visits\" in which no contact\neither by way of person or objects is permitted between the\nresident and the visitor, and thus in most circumstances, said\nstrip searches may be considered unnecessary to preserve the\n\"maximum security\" character of the institution; in unusual1\ncircumstances or for specific reasons strip searches of inmates\nin connection with visitation may be deemed to be reasonable\nand necessary.\nProposed Remedy\nIt is agreed that inmates shall not be subject to routine\n\"strip searches\" in connection with the exercise of their visi-\ntation privileges; however, in the event a senior member of the\nstaff of St. Louis County Jail has reasonable grounds to be-\nlieve that a strip search is necessary in connection with a ,\nspecific visitation, a strip search of a resident in connection\nwith a visitation may be required.\n9.  ANTIQUATED VISITING BOOTHS\nCREATING INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nAs indicated previously in thiB Stipulation, all visita-\ntions in St. Louis County Jail are \"secure\" visits; in connec-\ntion therewith, each of the visiting booths is equipped vith a\n-25-\n-rr\n\nmechanism which is designed to permit the passage of sound\nbetween the resident and his visitor while at the same time\ntotally prohibiting the passage of any object between said\n*\nperBons; because, from time to time, unknown persons have\nattempted to tamper with said device, repairs have been made\nthereto which somewhat inhibit the passage of sound in an\nappropriate manner; defendants have agreed that profit made\nfrom the sale of sundry items to the residents could be made\navailable for the purchase of equipment for telephonic communi-\ncations between resident and visitor thereby eliminating the\nneed for the aforesaid' devices, and thus permit the removal\nthereof while at the same time improving communications between\nresident and visitor.\nProposed Remedy\nDefendant shall prepare a plan for the installation of\ntelephonic communication devices for the visiting booths in\nSt. Louis County Jail to replace the present device used to\ntransmit the sound between visitor and resident; said plan\nshall provide for the installation of said devices on a\nstaggered basis based upon receipt of available funds from\nanticipated profit from the sale of merchandise in the\ncommi ssary.\n10.  INTERNAL ASSAULTS\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nPlaintiffs submitted evidence of specific internal assaults\nwhich are defined by the parties as assaults by one inmate upon\n-26-\n\n'.I ,\nanother; investigation;b\"y counsel for plaintiffs and by repre-\nsentatives of defendants have independently revealed evidence\nof other instances of internal assault; however, in the over-\nwhelming number of specific cases, the victim of the assault,\nfor various reasons, either refuses to testify concerning said\nmatters or is reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement  ,\nofficials, with the result that successful prosecution (either\ncriminally or administratively) is essentially impossible; upon\nreceipt by defendants of any complaint from a resident with\nrespect to internal assaults, both internal procedures are\nundertaken and a report is made with the Clayton Police Depart-\nment; said department responds, interviews the complainant and\nmakes a report thereof; actual criminal prosecution of said\nmatters is not within the jurisdiction of defendants and defen-\ndants cooperate with appropriate authorities in the event of\nthe institution of criminal proceedings; within the limitations\nof the design of the confinement areas of the present St. Louis\nCounty Jail meaningful increased observation of residents in an\neffort to reduce potential internal assaults is impractical and\ncould not reasonably be expected to result in any reduction\nthereof; the correctional officers assigned to the respective\nareas of the institution must be vigilant to guard against the\nopportunity for said assaults.\n-27-\n\n11.  LACK OF RECREATION  !\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nThe Order of the Court in Johnson v. O'Brien with respect\nto recreational facilities is being met by defendants; the\nrecreational area has been altered and the facilities presently\ninclude bar bells, strength testing devices, weight machines,\nfoosball machines, punching bags, handball court and facilities\nfor basketball; the program is operated from approximately 8:00\na.m. until midnight and each inmate is given the opportunity\nfor use of the facilities in accordance with the previous\nOrder; counsel for plaintiffs are unaware of any significant or\nsubstantial complaints from any of the plaintiffs with respect\nto the operation and use of the recreational program; the\npresent program has inmate acceptance and should be continued.\n12.  LENGTH OF PRETRIAL DETENTION\nStatement of Stipulated Facts\nWith minor exceptions caused by unusual isolated circum-\nstances, the facility operated by defendants on the fourth\nfloor and known as St.- Louis County Jail is used for the\ndetention of male persons on one of the following basis:  (a)\ndetained in a pretrial status and charged with a crime against\nthe person such as murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping or\nthe like or (b) held in custody on a writ issued by a Court\nrequiring the production of a person previously committed to\nthe custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections, whose\npresence is required in St. Louis County in connection with\n-28-\n\nsome judicial proceeding or (c) a person in custody awaiting\nhearing on a petition for the revocation of probation or parole\n.or (d) a minor certified under the provision of the Juvenile\nCode for trial as an adult.  Each of said persons is committed\nto the custody of defendants pursuant to an order issued by an\nappropriate Court; the defendants in this action have no dis-\ncretion as to whether or not, or upon what terms, any resident\nis released from custody; because of the nature of the charges\nfor-which pretrial detainees are held in St. Louis County Jail,\nto-wit a felony, each inmate is represented by an attorney at\nlaw, retained by him or by the public defender; questions with\nrespect to reduction in bond or release on the resident's own\nrecognizance are matters which must be submitted to a Court for\ndetermination and counsel for said residents, and not defen-\ndants are the appropriate persons to submit said motions to the\nCourt; the defendants in the present action are not personally\ncapable of exercising control over the length of time between\nthe institution of a charge against a member of the class and\nthe date on which judicial resolution of said charge is  \\\nreached; the question of excessive pretrial detention and any\nrelief to which a person may be entitled as the result thereof,\nare more appropriately presented to a Court by a member of the\nclass of plaintiffs in said person's criminal action than as \\\n.claims against the present defendants in this action.  . '\n18.  In addition to the foregoing 12 areas of complaints as\ncatagorized by the Honorable Magistrate in his Review and\n-29-\n\nRecommendation, plaintiffs presented evidence concerning the\nmanner in which residents aged 16 and under are.housed in  |\nSt. Louis1)County Jail;'upon entry of an Order by the Judge jof\nthe Juvenile Division, certifying that an individual is to be\nproceeded against as an adult, custody of the subject is relin-\nquished by the Juvenile Court and, if warrants are issued b!y\nthe prosecuting attorney, the subject is forthwith transferred\nto the St. Louis County Jail; the number of certified juveniles\nmaintained in St. Louis County Jail varies from time to time;\non March 9, 1981 eight certified juveniles 16 years of age or\nunder were residents of St. Louis County Jail; more recently as\nfew as three certified juveniles were residents of St. Louis\nCounty Jail; at such time as there are appropriate numbers'of\ni\ncertified juveniles, either the SOUTH MODULE or the CLOSE\nSECURITY areas, respectively, were used by the defendants for\nthe housing of certified juveniles so that in such circum-\nstances the certified juveniles were segregated from other\nresidents to the greatest extent possible while still residing\nwithin the confines of the jail; both the Statutes of Missouri,\n211.151(4), and 211.331(2) R.S.Mo. 1978 and the Rules promul-\ngated by the defendants (see Exhibit 22, page 49, paragraph 3)\nprohibit'the housing of certified juveniles in such circum-\nstances as they are either housed or mingled with adult\nprisoners; the Supreme Court of Missouri in State v. Kemper,\nMo. App. 1975 535 S.W. 2d 241, held that it is a violation of\nMissouri statute^ to house certified juveniles in such circum-\n-30-\n\n•  stances as they came into contact with adult prisoners; all\n• parties to this action stipulate and agree that any and all\npersons under the age of seventeen years certified by the\nJuveni-le Court to be prosecuted under the general existing law\nas adults must be housed in such a manner as totally to segre-\n. gate them from all other adult detainees.\n• i\nProposed Remedy\nThe parties stipulate and agree that on such occasions as\nany person 16 years of1age or under is detained by defendants,\nsaid person shall be kept in an area totally segregated from\nall persons.aged 17 or over; in Buch circumstances as persons\n; 16 years of age or under are maintained by defendants in\n, St. Louis County Jail not only shall all such persons be housed\nin an area separate and apart from other inmates but also said\njuveniles shall not be fed, given recreation, toilet and/or\nshowering facilities or in any other manner permitted to come\ninto contact or associate with any detainee aged 17 or over.\n19.  Counsel for plaintiffs in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and\nCause No. 76-210 C (2) are not counsel for plaintiff in Cause\nNo. 82-223 C (4), William J. Bruce, Plaintiff, v. St. Louis\nCounty Department of Justice Services, Inc.. which action was,\nas heretofore indicated, consolidated'into this action by order\nof Judge William L. Hungate; the parties hereto, however,\nstipulate and agree that the Complaint filed, pro se by plain-\ntiff in that action alleges that plaintiff was at the time of\nthe filing thereof a pretrial detainer resident of St. Loui6\n-31-\n\nCounty Jail; by his Complaint, plaintiff Bruce seeks an order\npermitting said plaintiff to have \"contact\" visits with visi-\ntors; said \"contact\" visits, presumably being defined as a\nvisitation between a resident of the jail and a visitor, in\nwhich the resident and the visitor are permitted to touch or\ni'\notherwise physically come into contact with each other; plain-\ntiff seeks no relief by way of money judgment against defen-\ndants in said action; the parties hereto state and represent to\nthe Court that on or about March 13, 1981 William J. Bruce was\nadmitted as a resident of St. Louis County Jail on charges of\nforcible rape and kidnapping on warrants issued by.the State of\nMissouri; at said time defendants herein further were in\npossession of detainers from the states of Indiana and Kentucky\nwith respect to plaintiff Bruce; on or about April.15, 1982 •\nWilliam J. Bruce left the custody of defendants herein and was\ntransported to the Department of Corrections of the State of\nMissouri in Jefferson City, Missouri on a commitment and sen-\ntence of 50 years to said Department; at no time subsequent to\nApril 15, 1982 has plaintiff Bruce been .in the custody of\ndefendants in St. Louis County Jail; counsel for defendants in\nthis action state to the Court that any and all complaints\nand/or claims of plaintiff Bruce are included within the\nmatters before this Court in the allegations of the class  \\\naction in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and that any and all relief to\ni\nwhich plaintiff Bruce is or may be entitled should be included\ni\nwithin the final Order entered by this Court in said action No.\n-32-\n\n79-650 C (2); counsel for defendants further state that the\nindividual action filed by Mr. Bruce not only should be consi-\ndered included within the aforesaid class action, but also any\nsuch claims have been rendered moot by the removal of said\nplaintiff Bruce from custody of defendants on or about April\n15, 1982; counsel for plaintiffs in Cause No. 79-650 C (2) and\n76-210 C (2) state that the plaintiffs in said actions have not\nand do not take the position that the residents in St. Louis\nCounty Jail have an unqualified constitutional right to contact\nvisits.\n20.  The counsel for plaintiffs in this action have made\nclaim against defendants for allowance of attorneys' fees and\nexpenses incurred in representing the members of the class in\nthis action;.the parties hereto stipulate and agree that coun-\nsel for plaintiffs shall within the time period directed by the\nCourt file with the Court their verified Motion for Allowance\nof Attorneys' Fees together with Affidavits in support thereof\nand that upon receipt of copies thereof by counsel for defen-\ndants, defendants may have such time thereafter as may be set\nby the Court within which to file defendants' Suggestions in\nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees; the\nparties hereto stipulate and agree that said claims for attor-\nneys1  fees may be submitted to the Court for consideration and\ndetermination in the foregoing manner in lieu of presentation\nof testimony and evidence to the Court.\n-33-",

LOUIS COUNTY, MISSOURI,  )\net al.,  )\n)\nDefendants.  )\nANSWER TO PLAINTIFF'S AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nAND OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF\nComes now Defendants Gene McNary and Edward Moreland and for their\nAnswer to Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint for Declaratory Judgment,\nInjunctive Relief and Other Appropriate Relief state to the Court as\nfollows:\nStatement of Facts\n1.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 7 of Complaint:\nPlaintiffs and the classes each represent have been, are, and will\ncontinue to be subjected to the shocking, dehumanizing, illegal and\nunconstitutional conditions and practices enumerated  in this complaint.\nThese conditions and practices exist because of the willful and\nintentional acts, policies and omissions of the defendants in this\naction.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\n=  Paragraph 7 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n2.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 8 of Complaint:\nco\no  The St. Louis County Jail was erected in 1940 to serve as a\n5  \"county\" jail.  At that time the population of St. Louis County was\nn\n«|  less than 1 million and the County was primarily rural.  The county has\n-^  grown and its character changed as the St. Louis County Metropolitan\nArea has grown.  The county is now primarily urban with a population in\nexcess of one million.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the St. Louis County Jail was\nr erected in 1950 and that St. Louis County has a population of\napproximately one million.  Defendants do not have sufficient knowledge\nto answer as to the term \"character\" of St. Louis County nor as to the\nterm \"St. Louis County Metropolitan Area.\"\n\n3.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 9 of Complaint:\nT\nThe inmates in the St. Louis County Jail, both pre-trial and\ndetainees and sentenced inmates, are housed on the 4th floor of the\nstructure.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit certain inmates are housed on the 4th\nfloor but in addition inmates are also housed on the 3rd floor.\n4.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 10 of Complaint:\nThe St. Louis County Jail's inmate population fluctuates.  The\naverage daily number of prisoners housed at the jail is 112.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the jail's population fluctuates\nand that the average daily number of prisoners housed exceeds 112\ninmates.\nUNSANITARY AND UNSAFE CONDITIONS\n5.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 11 of Complaint:\nThe cells are infested with roaches and mice.  There is also a\nfungus which frequently grows on some walls of the jail during periods\nof high humidity and heat.  Whenever this fungus is present, there is\nan increase of respiratory ailments among the inmates.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 11 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n6.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 12 of Complaint:\nWindows in the jail vary in their condition.  In 1975 a majority\nof the windows were blocked up and air conditioning units installed.\nThe exhaust vents on the roof provide the only source of ventilation in\nthe cell areas.  This lack of ventilation causes foul odors to collect\nand constantly permeate the air.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit the windows vary in their condition but\ndeny that air conditioners were installed in any of the windows and\ndeny each and every other allegation of Paragraph 12 of Plaintiffs'\nComplaint.\n7.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 13 of Complaint:\nThe mattresses for the bunks are filthy, foul-smelling and never\ncleaned, aired out or disinfected.  No mattress covers are furnished\nand there is often a long period of time between changing of sheets.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that there are not mattress covers but\ndeny each and every other allegation set forth in Paragraph 13 of\n-2-\n\nT Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n8.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 14 of Complaint:\nThe only cleaning in the jail is done by the inmates.  Inmates who\nare trustees are responsible for the halls and common areas, while all\ninmates are solely responsible for their cells.  Inmates who are not\ntrustees frequently have difficulty obtaining the proper cleaning\ntools, such as mops and brooms.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit the inmates and inmate trustees clean\nthe jail but deny that cleaning materials are not made available.\n9.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 15 of Complaint:\nShowers and open toilet areas are contained in each cell except\nfor the women's cell that has a separate enclosed bath room.  The only\ncleaning of these areas is done by the inmates occupying the individual\ncells who are seldom provided with the proper materials to adequately\nclean these areas.  Consequently these areas are breeding grounds for\nbacteria and fungus.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that showers and open toilet areas are\nT\ncontained in each cell including the women's cells.  The cleaning of\nthese areas is done by inmates occupying the individual cells in\naddition to inmate trustees but deny that said inmates and trustee\ninmates are not provided with the proper materials to adequately clean\nthese areas.  Defendants deny that the areas are breeding grounds for\nbacteria and fungus.\n10.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 16 of Complaint:\nInmates are required to eat their meals in their cells, which are\nusually in a dirty and unsanitary condition due to the limited amount\nof cleaning previously described.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that inmates are required to eat their\nmeals in their cells but deny that the cells are dirty or unsanitary\ndue to the limited amount of cleaning.\n11.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 17 of Complaint:\nThere is insufficient hot water for inmates to take showers.\nNormally an inmate must shower in cold water or remain dirty.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 17 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n12.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 18 of Complaint:\n-3-\n\nPersonal hygiene items such as shampoo, soap, tooth paste, tooth\nbrushes, and combs are sometimes difficult to obtain.  No razors are\ngiven to any inmates, except during sporadic times when groups of\ninmates are allowed to shave in one common room.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that razors are not given to inmates and\nthat shaving is only allowed as a group activity but deny that personal\nhygiene items such as soap, toothpaste, shampoo, toothbrushes and combs\nare difficult to obtain.\n13.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 19 of Complaint:\nLaundry is supposed to be done once a week for all inmates by the\ntrustees.  However, because of breakdowns in the equipment, washing is\noften done only once a month.  Also inmates must wash their own socks\nin the sink without any detergent.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that occasionally breakdowns of equip-\nment do interrupt the washing schedule but deny that said schedule is\noften done only once a month.  Defendants admit that certain personal\ngarments such as socks are to be washed by the inmates in the sink but\ndeny that the inmates are not allowed detergent to wash said socks.\n14.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 20 of Complaint:\nThere are heating and cooling problems, causing the jail to be\nunreasonably cold in the winter and unreasonably hot in the summer.  At\nall times, the temperature varies from floor to floor.  Inmates often\nsuffer the harsh physiological effects of temperature extremes.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the temperature varies in the jail\nfrom floor to floor but deny each and every other allegation as set\nforth in Paragraph 20 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nLACK OF USE OF RECREATIONAL FACILITIES\n15.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 21 of Complaint:\nAn indoor area is provided for exercise or recreation of the\ninmates, but is not utilized due to a shortage of staff to supervise\nthe area.  This lack of recreation leads to mental and physical deteri-\noration.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that an indoor area is provided for\nexercise and recreation of inmates and that at times a full utilization\nof said area is not used due to a shortage of staff.  Defendants deny\neach and every other allegation set forth in Paragraph 21 of\nPlaintiffs' Complaint.\n-4-\n\nT\nFOOD\n16.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 22 of Complaint:\nThe food served to the inmates is nutritionally deficient.  Food\nwhich is supposed to be hot is always cold.  Inmates never receive\nfresh fruits or vegetables.  The portions of food which inmates do\nreceive are too small, leaving inmates still hungry immediately after\neating a meal.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 22 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nMEDICAL FACILITIES AND CARE\n17.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 23 of Complaint:\nAn inmate needing medical attention or medication from 5:00 p.m.\nto 9:00 a.m. must request it by getting a written or oral message to a\ncorrectional officer.  These officers have no procedure for routinely\nchecking with inmates to see who needs medical attention and they do\nnot in fact do so.  Even when officers receive requests for medical\nattention, these messages may not be conveyed to the medical staff at\nall.  Therefore, inmates must sometimes endure unreasonable delay in\nobtaining needed care.  For \"minor\" problems, such as colds, sores,\ndandruff, insect bites, rashes, corns, athlete's foot, headaches and\ntooth aches, it is very difficult to get any relief, even an aspirin.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that an inmate needing medical attention\nor medication from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. must request it by getting a\nwritten or oral message to a correctional officer, but deny each and\nevery other allegation set forth in Paragraph 23 of Plaintiffs' Com-\nplaint.\n18.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 24 of Complaint:\nWhen medical requests are made, the officer decides if the inmate\nreceives medical attention.  The officer has no specialized training to\ndiagnosis or to determine if medical assistance is required.  There-\nfore, the decision to allow medical assistance is often at the whim of\nthe officer.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that a correctional officer decides if\nT\nan inmate receives medical attention but deny each and every other\nallegation set forth in Paragraph 24 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n-5-\n\n19.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 25 of Complaint:\nThere is no medical screening procedure to test for contagious\ndiseases.  Trustees who handle all food preparation tasks do receive\nlimited amount of screening for certain diseases.  However, this\nscreening frequently does not take place until the inmate has been on\nthe job for a number of weeks, thus rendering these tests meaningless,\nexposing other inmates to great harm.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 25 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n20.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 26 of Complaint:\nNo dental care is provided.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that no preventative dentistry is pro-\nvided for inmates but deny each and every other allegation as set forth\nin Paragraph 26 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nVISITATION AND COMMUNICATION RIGHTS\n21.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 27 of Complaint:\nThe visiting facilities are grossly inadequate.  The visitation\nT\narea consists of a \"fish-bowl\" area where visitors enter.  Inmates are\nviewed through glass-like panels which are the walls of the \"fish-\nbowl\".  If more than two or three persons occupy this area it becomes\nvery crowded.  Inmates with visitors must stand on the outside of the\n\"fish-bowl\" and communicate with their visitors through a hole.  They\nare difficult for effective and meaningful communication.  There is\nonly one visit allowed per week.  Each inmate is allotted 1/2 hour per\nweek for visitation, with a limit of 3 visitors.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny that inmates are alloted one-half hour\nper week for visitation and deny that there is a limit of three visi-\ntors.  Defendants admit that the inmate is alloted one hour per week\nwith a limit of two visitors per said visit.  Defendants deny that if\ntwo people occupy the visiting area that said visiting area becomes\nvery crowded.  Defendants deny each and every other allegation set\nforth in Paragraph 27 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n22.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 28 of Complaint:\nT\nInmates are allowed an initial phone call upon admittance and are\nthereafter allowed to make one call per week.  According to the whims\nof some guards, certain inmates are permitted to make more calls, while\n-6-\n\nsome have their weekly call delayed until the very end of the week.\nInmates are allowed to speak to the person called for a period of 5\nminutes.  The calls take place in an office, with a social worker or\nofficer present, depriving them of any privacy.  If an inmate uses this\ncall to speak with his attorney, he is denied the confidentiality of\nthe attorney-client relationship.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 28 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nJAIL DISCIPLINE\n23.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 29 of Complaint:\nThe only written rules and regulations issued to inmates\nconsist of a general list of infractions classified by level of\nseriousness.  Included with this list is a generalized statement as to\nthe punishment to be given if a certain rule is broken.  The jail pur-\nports to have a policy whereby all inmates are to receive a copy of\nthese rules upon admission.  However, officers neglect to provide this\ndocument to incoming inmates.  Frequently inmates are, therefore, un-\naware of the existence of any formal rules or regulations.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 29 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n24.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 30 of Complaint:\nWhen inmates do violate a rule or regulation, no due process what-\nsoever is afforded the inmate.  Guilt or innocence is an arbitrary\ndecision made by the individual guard and the inmate may or may not be\npunished depending on the mood of the guard.  There is no procedure for\nappeal of a decision of guilt.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 30 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n25.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 31 of Complaint:\nA procedure exists for reducing the time to be served by a sen-\ntence inmate if he shows good behavior while in the jail.  Inmates lose\n\"good time\", as this practice is called, on the whim of the corrections\nofficers and are frequently not informed of this decision when it is\nf made.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that a procedure exists for reducing the\ntime to be served by a sentenced inmate if he shows good behavior while\n-7-\n\nin jail but deny that said procedure is based upon the whim of the\ncorrection officer as set forth in Paragraph 31 of Plaintiffs'\nComplaint.\n26.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 32 of Complaint:\nShakedowns occur at unreasonable times and are harrasslng in na-\nture.  When shakedowns do occur it is normal practice for officers to\nthrow bedding onto floors that have standing pools of water and to\nscatter personal items throughout the cell areas, causing them to be-\ncome lost and damaged.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that shakedowns do occur at various\ntimes but that said times are not unreasonable.  Defendants deny each\nand every other allegation as set forth in Paragraph 32 of Plaintiffs'\nComplaint.\n27.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 33 of Complaint:\nWhen admitted to the jail, all of an inmate's personal effects are\nplaced in a numbered bin in the property room located  in the basement.\nANSWER:  Defendants admit that when an inmate is admitted to the\nSt. Louis County Jail that his personal effects are placed in a\nnumbered box in a locked property room but deny that this area is\nlocated in the basement of the building.  Said area is located on the\nsame floor as the confinement area.  Defendants further state that an\ninmate, upon request, can obtain certain personal effects from said box\nsuch as legal books or documents.\n28.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 34 of Complaint:\nInmates are subjected to verbal abuse from officers, such as\nthreats, name-calling, intimidations, insinuations and harrassment.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 34 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n29.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 35 of Complaint:\nThere is no established procedure for registering inmate com-\nplaints.  The inmate must depend upon the good humor of the staff to\ncorrect any problem he or she might be having.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 35 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nINMATE SECURITY AND SUPERVISION\n30.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 36 of Complaint:\n-8-\n\nThose persons hired as guards for the St. Louis County Jail\nreceive no training to prepare them for their duties at a detention\nfacility.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation as set forth in\nParagraph 36 of Plaintiffs1 Complaint.\n31.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 37 of Complaint:\nThere is no effective procedure for the classification of inmates.\nPre-trial detainees, misdemeants and felons are all housed together.\nNo classification procedure exists based upon inmates' age, physical\nsize, crime or experience with the criminal justice system.  The only\nsystem of classification which does exist is an arbitrary one imposed\nby the staff attempting to separate violent inmates from those more\nwell-behaved.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 37 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n32.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 38 of Complaint:\nAdequate supervision of the inmates is impeded by the structure of\nT\nthe jail itself and the limited number of guard staff employed by the\njail.  There is no central location in the jail where guards can super-\nvise inmates located in cells and there are too few guards on duty at\nany given time to have someone stationed on each of the floors at all\ntimes.  Consequently, when assaults or medical emergencies have\noccurred in the past, guards have had difficulty determining from what\npart of the jail an inmate's cries for help have come.  Delays in\nlocating disturbances or medical emergencies have resulted in unneces-\nsary injuries which could have been prevented.  In instances where\ninmates are so severely injured or seriously ill preventing them from\ncrying out for help, even more grievous harm has occurred.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 38 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n33.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 39 of Complaint:\nPlaintiffs and the class they represent suffer mental and emo-\ntional as well as physical harm by incarceration at the St. Louis\n1\nCounty Jail.  Long term psychological damage results from the degrada-\ntion and demoralization associated with the unsanitary and inhumane\nliving conditions, the lack of adequate recreational facilities, the\n-9-\n\nT\nlong hours of idleness, the isolation, the deficient health program,\nthe almost total denial of contact with their families and friends, and\nthe inconsistent treatment by jail personnel.  This atmosphere deprives\nplaintiffs and the class they represent of all dignity and severely\ndamages their mental and emotional well-being.  The mental and emo-\ntional harm is demonstrated by the numerous suicide attempts at the\njail.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 39 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nFREEDOM TO PRACTICE RELIGION\n34.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 40 of Complaint:\nNo special diets are provided for those inmates whose religious\npreference requires one.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 40 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n35.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 41 of Complaint:\nr\nPlaintiffs and the class they represent, pretrial detainees, First\nAmendment Rights are violated by the officers placing the inmates'\nreading material from publishers in the property bin without allowing\nthe inmates access to the bin.  The inmates are restricted to only two\npieces of literature per week.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny that they violate the First Amendment\nrights of inmates by placing the inmates' reading material in the pro-\nperty bin without allowing inmates access to the bin.  Defendants admit\nthat inmates are restricted to two pieces of published material\n(excluding a Bible and/or legal documents) at any given time.\nDefendants further state that an inmate may request other published\nmaterials if he turns in the two in his possession at any time of the\nweek and hence theoretically could read numerous publications per week.\n36.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 42 of Complaint:\nPretrial detainees are impaired as to their right to aid in the\npreparation of their defense at trial in the following manner.\na.  There is no adequate facility for private conversations be-\ntween inmates and attorneys.  Most attorney-client visits take place in\nSocial Workers' offices.  Attorneys who do wish to speak privately with\ntheir clients must wait their turn to use the Social Worker's office.\n-10-\n\nThe hours for these visits are limited and if there are a large number\nof requests for private attorney visits, there may be a delay of\nseveral days before an inmate can consult privately with his attorney.\nb.  The jail does not have a Law Library.  The legal books are\nscattered remotely in Social Workers' offices and are inadequate to\nassist the inmates.  No provisions are made for inmates to have access\nto a law library if they should need to use one.\nc.  Inmate's legal papers, documents, notes, letters, and other\nrecords have been confiscated or destroyed.\nd.  Writing paper, pens, envelopes, etc. are often difficult to\nobtain, especially by those detainees who are indigent.\ne.  Lack of access to telephones inhibits proper attorney-client\ncommunication.  There are no special telephone privileges for\ncontacting attorneys, so a detainee has to use his one weekly call for\nthis purpose.  If the attorney is not in his office when the call is\nmade, the inmate cannot try again for another week.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nT\nParagraph 42 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n37.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 43 of Complaint:\nInmates are often forced to appear in court unshaven and wearing\ndirty, malodorous clothing.  The psychological impact of being unable\nto relate to a jury as dignified human beings has caused many inmates\nto be ineffective witnesses at trial.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 43 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n38.  Plaintiffs' Paragraph Number 44 of Complaint:\nInformation, rumors and personal correspondence concerning an\ninmate's case are openly and loudly discussed by jail staff.\nANSWER:  Defendants deny each and every allegation set forth in\nParagraph 44 of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\nDefendants request that the Court incorporate by reference\nnumerous documents provided by Defendants; said documents are\nidentified as three manila folders and designated Volume 1 of 3, Volume\n2 of 3, and Volume 3 of 3 which set forth with specificity the policies\nand practices of the St. Louis County Jail.  Defendants further state\nthe following:\n-11-\n\n1.  This Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter.\nT\n2.  The Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted against these Defendants.\n3.  The Amended Complaint is frivolous and malicious and should be\nstricken pursuant to 28 USC Code 1915(d).\nWHEREFORE, having fully answered Plaintiffs' Amended  Complaint\nDefendants Gene McNary and Edward Moreland pray that said Complaint be\ndismissed with prejudice at Plaintiffs' cost.\nTHOMAS W.

There is also a\nfungus which frequently grows on some walls of the jail during periods of\nhigh humidity and heat.  Whenever this fungus is present, there is an in-\ncrease of respiratory aliments among the inmates.\nResponse:  Interviews with St. Louis County Jail Staff indicate roaches\nand mice are not present in the jail and fungus does not grow on the walls.\nThe jail is serviced monthly by Sanders Pest Control Services.  Respiratory\naliments are not high among the inmates.  Mr. Corzine inspected the jail\nMarch 5, 1980 and saw no evidence of roaches, mice or fungus.  See attach-\nment A-l, A-2, A-3, A-6, C-l.\n12)  Windows in the jail vary in their condition.  In 1975 a majority of\nthe windows were blocked up and air conditioning units installed.  The exhaust\nvents on the roof provide the only source of ventilation in the cell areas.\nThis lack of ventilation causes foul odors to collect and constantly permeat\nthe air.\nResponse:  Staff interviewed during this investigation stated that the\nair is not foul, however the ventilation could be improved.  See attachment\nA-l, A-2, A-5, C-l.\n13)  The mattreses for the bunks are filthy, foul-smelling and never\ncleaned, aired out or disinfected.  No mattress covers are furnished and there\nis often a long period of time between changing of sheets.\nResponse:  Interviews with County Jail staff indicate that all mattresses\nare changed yearly.  Mattresses are not aired out or disinfected, mattress covers\nare not issued.  See attachments A-l, A-4, A-5, B-l, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, B-6,\nB-7, B-8, B-9.\nT\n\nare solely responsive for their cells.  Inmates who\"• Jre not trustees frequently\nhave difficulty obtaining the proper cleaning tools, such as mops and brooms.\n*r-  Response:  Dorm workers (prisoners) are responsible for assigned cleaning\ntasks which include cell areas, halls and common areas, all prisoners are\nresponsible for maintaining their respective cell area in a clean safe and\nsanitary manner.  Sufficient cleaning supplies are issued to prisoners three\ntimes each day.  See attachments A-2, A-5, A-6, B-ll.\n15)  Showers and open toilet areas are contained in each cell except for\nthe women's cell that has a separate enclosed bath room.  The only cleaning of\nthese areas is done by the inmates occupying the individual cells who are\nseldom provided with the proper materials to adequately clean these areas.\nConsequently these areas are breeding grounds for bacteria and fungus.\nResponse:  Proper cleaning materials are provided to all prisoners three\ntimes each day for the purpose of maintaining their living area in a clean,\nsanitary and safe manner.  See attachments A-3, A-4, A-5, B-ll.\n16)  Inmates are required to eat their meals in their cells, which are\nusually in a dirty and unsanitary condition due to the limited amount of\ncleaning previously described.\nResponse:  Proper cleaning materials are provided to all prisoners\nthree times each day for the purpose of maintaining their living area in\na clean sanitary and safe manner.

See attachment A-4.\n19)  Laundry is supposed to be done once a week for all inmates by the\ntrustees.  However, because of breakdowns  in the equipment, washing is often\ndone only once a month.  Also inmates must wash their own socks in the sink\nwithout any detergent.\nResponse:  All linen and resident clothing are laundred at the Adult\nCorrectional Institution once each week.  A washer and dryer are available\nfor use by all prisoners.  Dorm workers are assigned to wash and drying\nT\n*  clothing for other prisoners upon request.

The county jail does not allow any touch or\nphysical contact between detainee and visitors.\nOn or about April 15, 1982, plaintiff, William\nJ. Bruce, left the custody of the County Department of\nJustice Services, Inc., and was transported to the Department\nof Corrections of the State of Missouri in Jefferson\nCity as a result of a commitment and sentence of fifty\nyears to said department.\nAny claims made by Plaintiff Bruce have been\nrendered moot by the removal of said plaintiff from the\ncustody of defendant as aforedescribed.  However, the\nCourt notes that (contact visits are not constitutionally\nguaranteed. I Second, the Court finds refusal of such\nvisits to~\"be reasonable in this particular institutional\nsetting.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nEASTERN DIVISION\nJUL 241981\nROBERT E. BULLINGTON,\net al., EYVON  MENDENHAU\nU. S. DISTRICT COURT\nPlaintiffs, E. DISTRICT OF MO.\nv.  ) No. 79-650C(2)\n)\nWARDEN MORELAND, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendants.  )\nMAGISTRATE'S REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION\nSubject case was filed in the Federal District\nCourt on May 30, 1979. A prior case, styled Johnson v.\nO'Brien, 76-210C(4), was considered by the Honorable John\nF. Nangle, who issued an order pertaining thereto on\nDecember 30, 1977.  This prior case was consolidated into\nthe Bullington case and referred to the undersigned\nMagistrate for review and recommendation.  Said Magistrate\nhad assisted in the resolution of the Johnson case.\nCOMPLIANCE WITH ORDER OF DECEMBER 30, 1977\nJail detainees in this matter are represented\nby Messrs. James L. Thomas and John P. Emde, who were of\nenormous assistance to the Court.  In a preliminary report\nmade to the Court on February 6, 19 81, I indicated that\nsaid attorneys and myself made an unannounced visit at\nCD:\nno the St. Louis County Jail on February 3, 1981. At this\n!§ time, we ascertained that the directives of your judgment\nSi\nB and order entered on December 30, 197 7, had been basically\nsatisfied.\n•o\nWe then proceeded to examine the complaints\naddressed to the Court in Bullington v. Moreland, the\nprime case.  This Court conducted a series of hearings\nand listened to the testimony of Bullington and several\nother County Jail detainees.  The majority of the testimony\nlacked constitutional import and bordered on querulous\ncarping.  The complaints alleged in the petition and recited\nT\nin the subsequent hearings, could be catagorized into twelve\n\ngeneral areas, as follows:\n(1)  Overcrowding  by excess  population.\n(2)  Cold food and inadequate  portions\nthereof.\n(3)  Substandard medical-dental  facilities.\n(4)  Lack of a serviceable  library.\n(5)  Failure to provide prisoners with  jail\nrules.\n(6)  Lack of cleanliness.\n(7)  Prisoner mail  from courts and  attorneys\nbeing  censored.\n(8)  Strip searches, especially  after visits.\n(9)  Antiquated visiting booths  creating\ninadequate  communication.\n(10)  Internal  assaults.\n(11)  Lack of recreation.\n(12)  Length of pretrial  detention.\nOVERCROWDING\nAttached hereto is a breakdown of the  various\ndivisions of the County Jail indicating dimensions  and\npopulation.\n(A)  Red  zone.\nThis is the area that was  constructed\nin compliance with the Court's  order\nin Johnson v. O'Brien, supra.  The\narea and the population  comport with\nminimum circuit court directives.\n(B)  Green zone.\nThe common area afforded the  twelve\ninmates in three  4 man cells,\ngives adequate square  footage.\n(C)  North module.\nThis area contains nine  1 man  cells\nwhich average out over 115 square  feet\nper cell, per man.  These are  desirable\nareas that are used  for trustees  and\nfavored detainees.\n(D)  South module.\nThis consists of ten rooms which  are\nusually occupied by certified  juveniles.\nThese are spacious and adequate  facili-\nties affording each detainee over  112\nsquare  feet.\n(2)\n\n(E)  Close  security.\nT\nThese  five 2 men cells which are only\n45 square  feet per cell, pose  some\nproblem.  While there is an  adjacent\nday room that affords some 184  square\nfeet, it can only be used by one or\ntwo men at a time, because of the\nfriction existing in the unit.  The\nresult is that  for the vast majority\nof the day, each detainee has  only\nabout 23 square  feet of living  area.\nThis area could possibly be  altered\nas was the red zone to  incorporate\nthe day room area into the cell  area\nor reduce the population of each  cell\nto one man, in order to comport with\nEighth Circuit standards.\n(F)  Isolation.\nThe seven 1 man cells in isolation  afford\neach man approximately  63 square  feet.\n(G)  Infirmary.\nThe present infirmary has four beds  in\napproximately  158 square  feet.  Con-\nsidering the beds, this makes  for\npretty tight quarters, although  it\naffords each patient  approximately\n40 square  feet.\nWhen you total the indicated  capacity of  the\naforedescribed  units, you arrive at 147 detainee  spaces.\nAs I previously informed you, on the day we visited,  there\nwere  152 detainees in these spaces.  If the close  security\narea is unalterable, the population there should be  reduced\nby five.  This would reduce the total population to 142.\nHowever, the north and south modules, which are  basically\noccupied by relatively  low risk prisoners, could play  host\nto an additional  four cots or mattresses per unit on a\nquasi-temporary  basis.  We note, however, the use of\nadditional cots is somewhat restricted.  Presently,  these\ncots are being placed in the north and south module  day\nroom areas.  There are no toilet  facilities in these  day\nrooms.  This, of course, could be altered by the  County.\nThis, then could give the indicated capacity of the  County\nJail as such, at 150 detainees.\nNow the County maintains what they call an  Intake\nT\n(3)\n\nUnit, which has twelve 1 man cells.  These are unclassified\nprisoners, who are undergoing processing.  This unit usually\nhas at least double the twelve man indicated  capacity.\nThis is accommodated by placing additional mattresses on\nthe floor.  The County does not consider this part of the\njail proper for reasons best known to them.  This area\ncould accommodate twelve fold-down type bunks above the\nexisting beds, which would, more or less,  comfortably\ndouble its indicated capacity.  It should be noted that\nthe intake units, as they are presently utilized, are not\nsuitable for long term detention.  There is simply  inadequate\nspace to serve meals in these areas.  This would  furnish\nan additional 24 spaces for detainees, or intakees, whatever\nyou choose to call them.  The cost of the modification\nshould be modest.\nMr. Moreland testified at the hearings that in\naddition to the cell overcrowding, he lacked space for:\n7 (1)  An adequate law library.\n(2)  Room for social workers.\n(3)  Adequate lawyer-client  visitation.\n(4)  Kitchen expansion.\n(5)  Larger infirmary.\n(6)  Housing additional  correctional\nofficers.\nDepending upon the outcome of the bond  issue\nand, indeed, even before a successful bond issue election\ncan come into fruition, these suggested alternatives have\nto be considered by both the Court and the County of St.\nLouis.\nFOOD\nAlthough the prisoners complain about cold  food\nand inadequate portions, these complaints border on\nfrivolity, and we concluded that many of the complaints\nwere simply that certain prisoners did not like some types\n(4)\n\nof food served.  I observed the food to be both wholesome\nand the portions adequate to the average appetite.  All\nof the prisoners who testified before this Court appeared\nto be reasonably well nourished.\nMEDICAL-DENTAL FACILITIES\nI had previously reported to you that the medical\nprogram in the St. Louis County Jail was basically in confor-\nmance with your prior order made in the Johnson case.  There\nis a 9:00 a.m. sick call five days a week, wherein the\nLPN actually patrols the corridors, picking up medical\ncomplaints.  A physician visits the jail on Mondays, Wednesdays\nand Fridays, and a psychiatrist is available on Tuesdays,\nThursdays and Saturdays.  Dental problems are sent to Gumbo\nfor general dental therapy.  Previously, only extractions\nwere handled at the County Hospital.  The investigating\nMagistrate was unable to get any proof of sexual abuse\nfrom the medical personnel.  One casual observation should\nbe noted.  Both LPNs work the same shift.  Perhaps the\nCounty will be well advised to have one nurse work the\nmorning shift and the other work the afternoon shift.  This\nwould afford at least 16 of the 24 hours a day, some medical\ncoverage.\nLIBRARY\nFor all practical purposes, there is no County\nJail Library.  There is a small room in which the walls\nare basically decked with advance sheets.  The room is\napproximately 150 square feet and has a table in the center,\nwhich is made available to two prisoners at a time for\na period of one hour.  The social worker will make copies\nof cases needed from the courthouse library.  Actually,\nthe County should furnish a library which comports with\nthe requirements set out in Tyler v. Satz, No. 77-918C(l)\n(E.D. Mo. 1978).  This latter mentioned library was furnished\nby the City of St. Louis to its City Jail and has been\nT\nenthusiastically received.  It affords the detainees their\n(5)\n\nright to up-to-date legal information and utilizes much\nof their spare time in a pacific time consuming endeavor.\nJAIL RULES\nThe County has recently adopted a detailed set\nof rules.  Furthermore, each incoming detainee is given\na summary of the major disciplinary rules.  The jail\nadministration has made a serious attempt to comply with\ndue process requirements in the administration of its\ndisciplinary rules.  This complaint is thereby rendered\nmoot.\nCLEANLINESS\nAs previously reported, the Court's prior order\nhas been carried out.  A washer and dryer are available\nfor laundering and the residents can use these facilities\nby putting their clothes in a bag, which is then fed to\nthe machines by a trustee.  Various detainees who testified\nbefore this Court complained there was not enough soap\nT made available, but my personal inspection of the jail\npremises would indicate that it was basically clean.\nMAIL CENSORING\nInmates complained and testified that incoming\nmail from the courts and attorneys was censored.  County\nofficials denied this.  At any rate, the County should\nbe made aware of prisoners' rights to uncensored in-coming\nmail from courts and attorneys, as per existing case law.\nSTRIP SEARCHES\nThere were allegations of senseless routine strip\nsearches made in pleadings and testimony given thereon.\nThe County has abandoned strip searches after non-contact\nvisitation, which was a prior custom.  Obviously, occasional\nstrip searches are essential to security and should not\nbe the concern of this Court.\nVISITING BOOTHS\nT Jail residents complained of cumbersome communica-\ntion problems in existing visiting booths.  The communication\n(6)\n\nchannels have been further barred to disallow the passage\nof contraband.  This additional installation has created\nhearing problems.  Actually, a plexiglass shield with\ntelephonic communication on both sides would be the ideal\nsolution to visiting communication.\nINTERNAL ASSAULTS\nAlthough there were complaints and testimony\nof prisoner assaults on one another, we were unable to\nverify any such physical abuse.  There is no doubt but\nthat there are occasional fights and no doubt the somewhat\ncramped quarters contribute to friction, which ultimately\nrelieves itself in violence.  However, this seems to be\nthe way of man, and absent obvious tolerated brutality\nor the mixing of young prisoners with seasoned prior\noffenders, there is little that correctional officers can\ndo to avoid occasional physical fighting.  We do not feel\nthat the evidence on this score invites judicial interference.\nRECREATION\nAs previously reported, the County has installed\na recreation area in one of the old courtrooms on the\nsecond floor of the Old Courthouse.  When it was first\nopened for usage in 1980, there were two escapes from the\narea.  The recreation area was closed for awhile to make\nconstruction alterations and the insertion of a correctional\nofficer booth within the recreation facility.  Since then,\nthe exercise facility which include bar bells, strength\ntesting devices, weight machines, fooz ball machines,\npunching bags and a handball court have been used by the\nprisoners on a regular and acceptable basis.  The recreation\narea is operated from 8:00 a.m. until midnight.  Prisoners\nare given the opportunity to use the facility for one hour\nperiods on rotaing intervals.  There is a maximum limit\nof eight detainees permitted to use the facility at any\none time.  This type of a facility does not necessarily\nreplace a large outdoor activity area, but it at least\n(7)\n\nfurnishes the essential recreational facilities as required\nby the courts.\nPRETRIAL DETENTION\nBullington testified that 40% of the detainees\nwere there for more than eight months awaiting trial.  Mr.\nMoreland testified that the average pretrial detainee was\nin the County Jail eight and a half to nine months (he\nlater indicated to the press that this computation was\nerroneous and that the average detention was some five\nmonths).\nWhen you consider that the average federal\npretrial detainee is kept barely over thirty days, and\nthat the City Circuit Court pretrial detention period is\nthree months, there is a suggestion that county trial\nacceleration could possibly lessen jail population. In\nany event, this question is not before the Court at this\ntime.\nT\nThe foregoing report is limited to the recommenda-\ntions concerning the physical facilities of the existing\nSt. Louis County Jail.  This Court has assimilated, through\nthe courtesy of county officials and county circuit judges,\nstatistics concerning bond settings on prisoners, incarceration\nperiods while awaiting trial, and court dispositions which\ncould be made the subject of a supplementary report at\nsome future date.\nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE\nDated:  July 23, 1981\n\nCOUNTY JAIL DIVISIONS, DIMENSIONS AND POPULATION\n(96)  RED ZONE Twelve 8 men cells, 32 ft. x. 8 ft. = 256 sq. ft'.\n•? 8 men = 32 sq. ft. per man.\n(12)  GREEN ZONE Three 4 men cells, 8 ft. x. 14 ft. = 336 sq. ft.\ntotal + 564 sq. ft. day room = 900 sq. ft.\n* 12 men = 75 sq. ft. per man.\n(9)  NORTH MODULE  Nine 1 man cells, 58 sq. ft. per cell x 9 =\n522 sq. ft. total + 530 sq. ft. day room =\n1052 sq. ft. * 9 = 115 sq.

DiSTRiCT COURT\nPlaintiffs, )\nNo. 76-\nv.  )\nWILLIAM O'BRIEN, et al.,  )\nDefendants. )\nr MAGISTRATE'S MEMORANDUM\nSubject case has been under consideration\nin the Federal District Court for some time.  During\nthe pendency of this case, some twenty meetings have\nbeen held by the attorneys representing the prisoners\nin the St. Louis County Jail, the various executives\nof St. Louis County and this Court.  In addition, the\nundersigned Magistrate has been in frequent contact\nwith representatives of the St. Louis County Circuit\nCourt.  The sudden and enormous growth in population\nof St. Louis County, the resultant increased crime,\ntwo bond issues for the building of a new jail, which\nwere submitted to the voters and defeated, are contributing\nO\n\nfactors leading to the need to reconcile the differences\nbetween the County Jail detainees and their jailors.\nIn prior conferences and hearings in the courtroom,\nthe Court has narrowed the particular issues concerning\nthe County Jail to twelve in number.  These were set\nout in this Court's report to the District Court in\nJuly of 1981. ('Nine Of these issues have been reconciled\nbetween counsel for the detainees and the County Jail.\nThis reconcilation is contained in the stipulation of\nthe parties filed with this Court.  The undersigned\nMagistrate recommends that the District Court accept\nthe stipulation as submitted as being both fair and\nlegally acceptable to the Federal District Court.\nThe parties were unable^.tQ agree on Item 2\nwhich is titled COLD FOOD AND INADEQUATE PORTIONS THEREOF.'\nAs previously reported, the reviewing Magistrate,\nwithout notice to the jail, viewed and sampled the evening\nmeal.  It was tasty, adequate and visibly well balanced.\nIt was not o^ ^qurvi^t_standing, nor is such required.\nPrisoners testified before this Court that\nthere was occasional hair in the tray; that there was\nsometimes shells in the eggs; that the food was occasionally\nco_ld_£ that religious__eating prohibitions were not accommodated;\nthat slaw, zucchini, broccoli and spinach were  d^yj^eiL\nby many.  Several of these echoes are uttered frequently\n-2-\n\nin typical American households.  None of the complaining\nT\nwitnesses appeared to be anything but well nourished\nand the complaints bordered cm frivolity.  The reviewing\nMagistrate is satisfied that the diet_in the St. Louis\nCounty Jail comports with the requirementsjyof Ahrens  \\\nv. Thomas, 570 F.2d 286, 289  (8th Cir. 1978); Campbell \\\n]\nI\nv. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503 (8th Cir. 1980).  1\nINTERNAL ASSAULTS  -\"\"\"\"\"\"\nThe litigants in this matter made a realistic\nevaluation of the internal assault problem in their\nstipulation, page 26.  Internal assaults in jails and\npenal institutions are an ever present problem.  Tension,\nproximity, frustration, fear of punishment, lack of\nsex and racial tension contribute to frequent, physical\n(|  and emotional conflict.  The jail in question is antiquated\nand was built to serve a county one-third its present\nsize.\nAt the hearing conducted by the reporting\nMagistrate, one detainee, who wanted to remain anonymous,\nreported that he had been raped while another inmate\nwatched.  He said he reported the incident and the Clayton\nPolice subsequently investigated.  He was moved to isolation\nfor his own protection.  Bullington himself said he saw\na sexual assault in 1977, but did not report the incident\nbecause of fear.  One Kay Brown, a social worker, testified\nthat she only knew of one assault  (the one reported\nby the anonymous detainee).\nf\n\nThere was /neither claim nor proof of widespread\ninternal^ assault: J  It would appear that the defendant\nis doing all possible, considering the cramped facilities,\nto minimize internal assault.  The jailer has an active\nclassification process, which should be maintained.\nWhen an assault rarely occurs, the defendant is quick\nto call the local police authorities, who interview\nthe complainant and make a report thereon.  Actual criminal\nprosecution is then in the hands of the local prosecuting\nattorney and not within the jurisdiction of the defendant.\nOf course, this does not relieve the jailer of doing\nhis utmost to classify and protect the detainees.  However,\nit would appear that the complaints are extremely isolated\nand that all reasonably possible is being done to obviate\nviolence.  Absent constitutional violations, courts\ndefer to local jail administrators to protect fundamental\nrights of prisoners.  Campbell v. Cauthron, supra~T\nreviewing Magistrate makes no recommendation as to additional\norders in this direction.\nLENGTH OF PRETRIAL DETENTION\nPrisoners in the St. Louis County Jail are\nbasically there to await trial on criminal charges,\nor in answer to a writ issued by the Circuit Court of\nSt. Louis County.  As such, the detainees are committed\nto the county jailer, who has no control over the length\nof time of incarceration.  The jailer simply awaits judicial\n-4-\n\norder as to the future movement of the detainee.  The\njailer has no discretion as to whether_or not or as\nto what terms any detainee can be released from his\ncustody.  Obviously then, any question of unconstitutional\npretrial detention should be directed to the County Court\nby said inmates requesting acceleration of judicial\nprocess.  Inasmuch as there is no reason to censure\nthe jailer or rjsgujLre directign_jLjijfchis area, the reviewing\nMagistrate^makes no observations on the length of pretrial\ndetention.,\nv\n''Therefore, the reviewing Magistrate, recommends\nthat the above observations coupled with the stipulation\nof the parties, be posted in the St. Louis County Jail\nto invite objection/ if necessary, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§636(b).\nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE\nDated:  June 21, 1983",

Further, at page 4\nof the Review and Recommendation, the Honorable Magistrate states\nas follows:\n^^ ^   Mr. Moreland testified at the hearings that in\n= =\n^™^\"*\"  addition to the cell overcrowding, he lacked space\nHZ^S  for:\n*^\"\"*^  (1) An adequate law library.\n)t5H55S  (2)  Room for social  workers.\nO 55^5S5<o\n. — —— -q-  (3)  Adequate lawyer-client visitation.\nDM—j^T-  (4) Kitchen expansion.\n•gS^SSsO  (5) Larger infirmary.\n5S35^  (6) Housing additional correctional\n^^^^_  officers.\nM~ ~\"  Depending upon the outcome of the bond issue\n^^^^^  and, indeed, even before a successful bond issue\nIM*^\"\"™  election can come into fruition, these suggested\n—^-^—  alternatives have to be considered by both the Court\n——  and the County of St. Louis.\n7\nThus, plaintiffs assume that the present report of the Honor-\nable Magistrate is not intended by him to be dispositive of all\nin™\n\nissues submitted for evidentiary hearing and consideration and\nrecommendation by him.\nFor this reason, plaintiffs, in this response, will comment\nupon the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate, subject\nmatter by subject matter and will urge the Court to return the\nmatter to the Magistrate for further consideration and recommen-\ndation of those matters not already covered by the Magistrate.\nTHE STANDARDS BY WHICH PLAINTIFFS\nRIGHTS ARE TO BE MEASURED\nPlaintiffs in this action are defined as \"all pretrial\ndetainees confined within the St. Louis County Jail at Clayton,\nMissouri.  Thus, as persons incarcerated prior to any finding of\nguilt, plaintiffs are presumed innocent and the conditions of\ntheir confinement are measured by the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979).\nPersons may not be \"punished\" prior to conviction and thus,\nif confinement in the St. Louis County Jail constitutes \"punish-\nment\" , the constitutional rights of plaintiffs are being\nviolated.  The Eighth Circuit has reviewed pretrial confinement\nconditions and in Campbell v. Cauthron, 623 F. 2d 503 (1980)\nset forth rather clearly defined standards for the measuring\nof pretrial inmates' constitutional rights.  The Court in the\nCampbell case further comments upon, reviews and analyzes\nvarious other cases, with the result that the views of the\nEighth Circuit appear to be clearly set forth or reasonably\npredictable.\nWhen measured by the announced constitutional standards,\nit is impossible to conclude other than that confinement in the\nSt. Louis County Jail does in fact constitute \"punishment\".\nIn all candor, counsel for plaintiffs must concede that\nr\nthe problems existing in the jail are almost without exception\nnot problems of the attitude, motive, or intent of Mr. Moreland\nand his staff, but rather problems related directly to, and\n-2-\n\narising from the total lack of space.  The staff has demonstrated\na concern and interest in providing such things as appropriate\nlibrary space, recreational facilities, counseling,  educational\nopportunities for the 15 and 16 year old youths confined in the\njail, religious services, dental services and the like.  Either\nthe absence or the inadequacy of the foregoing services, is more\nthe result of inadequate space within which to perform such ser-\nvices than a recalcitrance or refusal to provide the same on the\npart of St. Louis County.  Unfortunately, irrespective of the\ngood intentions of the County, the result is the same.\nThe jail does not pass muster.\nConfinement in St. Louis County Jail ,is_ punishment.\nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights are being violated.\nPlaintiffs will now comment upon the Report of the Magistrate\non a topic by topic basis.\n1.  OVERCROWDING\nThe greatest single problem in St. Louis County Jail is\nthe almost total inability of the staff to carry out in practice\nits own classification system.  Upon entry into the system,\neach new resident is classified according to his age, physical\nand mental condition, history of past anti-social behavior,\ndegree of severity of the existing charge, and status as to\na convicted or pretrial detainee.  Based upon such classification\nan  objective determination is made as to the specific location\nwithin the jail in which the new inmate should be housed.  In\nmost instances, it is impossible for the staff to house the\ninmate in the recommended location.  Those who are violent,\npsychotic and combative to other inmates and staff and who\nshould be isolated, are,for lack of space, sharing cells with\nseven other men.  And visa versa, an inmate who has never spent\na night in jail, who has no history of anti-social behavior,\nis placed in a shared cell with multiple repeat offenders.\nf\n-3-\n\nThe jail is overcrowded to the extent that the staff cannot\npossibly carry out its own proper classification and screening\nsystem.\nFor this reason, the overall aggregate number of inmates\nwithin  the institution should be limited so as to permit proper\nassignment of all inmates to appropriate space.\nAs indicated by the Magistrate's Report, inmates confined\nin the green zone, the north module, the south module, and the\nisolation units are all housed in areas which meet the Eighth\nCircuit test with respect to square feet per man.  The red zone\nis marginal and, depending upon interpretation, may or may not\nmeet the test of the Eighth Circuit.  Plaintiffs agree with the\nMagistrate's report with respect to close security and urge the\nCourt to limit the population therein to one man per cell. Plaintiffs\nsuggest that the Court limit the population of the infirmary to\nnot more than two persons.  Consideration must be given, not only\nto raw square foot numbers, but to the ability of the staff to\nmove about in the infirmary for the purpose of treating the inmates\nhoused therein.\nAs indicated by the Magistrate, the County does not include\nthe intake unit in computing the 14 7 man capacity of St. Louis\nCounty Jail.  The persons housed in the intake unit are held in\nthat unit for periods usually not exceeding three days.  Plaintiffs\nunderstand that the County has completed installation of the\n\"fold down\" bunks to which the Magistrate refers.  Based upon\nthis assumption, plaintiffs submit that the Court should order\nthat the population of the intake unit be limited to two persons\nper cell with no inmate to be held in the intake unit for more\nthan 72 consecuitive hours.\nPlaintiffs further request the Court to limit the number of\ncots which may be used in connection with the north and south\nmodules.  The exact limitation will depend in part upon the number\nf\nand manner in which additional toilet facilities are installed\n-4-\n\nas suggested by the Magistrate.\n2.  FOOD\nPlaintiffs do not agree with the Report of the Magistrate\nwith respect to food.  Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court\nto permit further presentation of arguments as to this matter.\n3.  MEDICAL-DENTAL FACILITIES\nThe plaintiffs agree with the recommendation of the Magistrate\nwith respect to the assignment of the LPNs working at the jail.\nFurther, plaintiffs suggest that appropriate arrangements be made\nfor the services of an LPN on the weekend and holidays.\n4.  LIBRARY\nPlaintiffs totally and fully agree with the Report of the\nMagistrate with respect to the library.  Plaintiffs further request\nthe Court to refer the question of library space to the Magistrate\nfor further recommendations with regard to the specific manner\nr in which library facilities may be brought into constitutional\ncompliance.\n5.  JAIL RULES\nPlaintiffs agree with the Report of the Magistrate concerning\njail rules.  The parties have entered into a stipulation concerning\nthis matter, which in due course will be fully implemented, ren-\ndering this subject matter moot.\n6.  CLEANLINESS\nPlaintiffs agree with the Report of the Magistrate.\n7.  MAIL CENSORING\nPlaintiffs agree with the Report of the Magistrate concerning\nmail censoring.  The parties have entered into a stipulation con-\ncerning the promulgation of rules and practices concerning inmates'\nmail from courts and attorneys.  It is anticipated that this matter\nwill be rendered moot upon the consummation of such stipulations.\n8.  STRIP SEARCHES\nr Plaintiffs' chief complaint concerning strip searches was\nwith respect to noncontact visitation.  Searches have been\n-5-\n\nabandoned with respect to visitation and thus plaintiffs have\nno present complaint concerning the same.\n9.  VISITING BOOTHS\nThe parties have discussed possible solutions concerning\nplaintiffs' complaints concerning the visiting booths.  Plaintiffs\nagree with the Magistrate's Report and intend to discuss this\nsubject further with defendants in the hope of reaching a solution.\n10.  INTERNAL ASSAULTS\nPlaintiffs submit that internal assauts (prisoner vs.\nprisoner) are essentially related to inability of the staff\nto carry out into practice the procedure with regard to the\nclassification and housing of inmates.  Except as the problem\nof overcrowding is solved, there will be no solution to the\nproblem of inmate fighting.\n11.  RECREATION\nThe plaintiffs agree with the Report of the Magistrate\nwith regard to recreation.\nHowever, it must be noted that from time to time the elevator\nrequired to be used in connection with recreation malfunctions\nresulting in a total suspension of recreation.  Also, because\nof physical considerations with respect to the movement of inmates\nfor recreation, any shortage of correctional officers caused by\nillness, adverse weather conditions, or the like, causes the\ntemporary suspension of recreational privileges.  In the absence\nof such unusual circumstances, the recreation program appears\nto be functioning as well as possible given the physical limitations.\n12.  PRETRIAL DETENTION\nPlaintiffs fully agree with the implication in the Magistrate's\nReport to the effect that in many instances an inordinate amount\nof time passes between original confinement as a pretrial detainee\nand disposition of such charges by trial, plea or otherwise.\nPlaintiffs submit that the matter should be returned to the Magistrate\nf\n-6-\n\nT\nfor further consideration and recommendation with respect to what,\nif any, steps may be taken to remedy this situation.\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiff respectfully requests the Court to approve the\nReport of the Magistrate in the respects herein indicated, to\nreject the Report of the Magistrate in the respects herein indi-\ncated and to return the case to the Magistrate for further review\nand recoiranendation.\nRespectfully Submitted,\n^  P.
