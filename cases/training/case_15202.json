    "summary": "<p>On November 1, 2013, female inmates housed at the all-women Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Pittsfield Township, Michigan, sued the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) over its strip-search policies. Beginning in 2009, MDOC required each prisoner at Huron Valley to sit on a chair and spread her labia to allow female corrections officers to check her vaginal cavity for contraband after returning from off-site visits and after meeting with anyone during direct-contact visits. The plaintiffs alleged that the chairs were improperly sanitized, and that prisoners weren’t able to properly sanitize their hands before touching their genitals, exposing them to a heightened risk of contracting diseases through contact with the bodily fluids of other prisoners. They further alleged that the searches were carried out in view of other prisoners and male corrections officials. The plaintiffs brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. §1983. They argued that by requiring strip searches in unsanitary conditions and in view of other prisoners and male corrections officials, MDOC was deliberately indifferent to the health, safety, privacy and bodily integrity of inmates, in violation of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs asked the court for class certification to represent other prisoners who are, were, or will be confined at Huron Valley and who have been or may be subjected to spread-labia search. They further asked the court to: declare the spread-labia search technique unconstitutional; issue a permanent injunction requiring Huron Valley correctional staff to stop performing such searches; issue an injunction requiring Huron Valley to provide medical and mental health care to address ongoing harm being suffered by the plaintiffs, including mental anguish, trauma, and infections caused by the unsanitary conditions; award damages to the plaintiffs for harm suffered, including punitive damages where appropriate; and to award the plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Paul D. Borman.</p><p>On May 1, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part MDOC’s motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiffs’ claim for monetary damages was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. It also found that, because the warden had taken reasonable steps to avert the risks associated with the spread-labia search procedure (conducting an inquiry, taking action to make it more sanitary, and eventually ending it as a routine procedure in 2011), correctional staff had not violated the Eighth Amendment. </p><p>However, the court found that if the spread-labia searches were carried out under unsanitary conditions with other prisoners and male corrections officials watching, then the prison may have violated the prisoners’ Fourth Amendment right to privacy. The court further found that because the plaintiffs had also alleged that the spread-labia search was still being carried out, even if it was no longer officially a routine procedure, the plaintiffs could be entitled to prospective injunctive relief prohibiting corrections officials from continuing the practice. This meant that the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim was sufficiently strong to survive MDOC’s motion to dismiss. On March 9, 2016, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the court’s denial of qualified immunity to the prison’s warden, and dismissed MDOC’s appeal of the district court’s order denying the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims for prospective injunctive relief. 643 Fed. App’x 526.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on August 11, 2016, but the definition of their proposed class changed multiple times throughout the proceedings. In an effort to ensure the class was ascertainable, the plaintiffs proposed in their reply brief the following class definition: “current and former women incarcerated at WHVCF since 2010 who were eligible for offsite trips and contact visits and were thus, pursuant to the practice of WHVCF subject to the ‘chair portion’ of Defendants’ strip searches.” During oral argument, the plaintiffs proposed two subclasses: (1) women who were currently or had formerly been incarcerated at the relevant facility and were subject to the chair portion of the strip search in view of other people sometime between November 1, 2010 and November 1, 2013; (2) women who were currently or had formerly been incarcerated at the relevant facility and were subject to the chair portion of the strip search under unsanitary or unhygienic conditions between November 1, 2010 and December 16, 2011. The plaintiffs asserted that individuals in both subclasses had suffered compensable injuries. </p><p>In its decision on December 22, 2016, the court rejected the motion for certification as to both proposed subclasses. As to the unsanitary conditions subclass, the court denied certification because the Sixth Circuit had affirmed that MDOC was protected by qualified immunity.  As to the subclass of inmates subjected to search in public, the court found that the class was ascertainable, but did not meet the adequacy of representation, numerosity, and typicality requirements for class certification. 2016 WL 7409953.</p><p>The parties were referred to Magistrate Judge Steven Whalen for a settlement conference on July 19, 2017.  The court denied motions for summary judgment from both parties on August 24, 2018.  On September 16, 2019, the court again denied class certification, and scheduled a bench trial (named plaintiffs only) for November 6, 2019.</p><p>On October 17, 2019 the plaintiffs, without explanation, dismissed their claims.  The court closed the case on October 18, 2019.</p>",

HEYNS, et al.,\nDefendants.\n______________________________/\nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’\nMOTION TO DISMISS AND FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BASED ON QUALIFIED\nIMMUNITY (ECF NO. 11)\nPlaintiffs filed this class action complaint on November 1, 2013.  (ECF No. 1).  On\nJanuary 21, 2014, Defendants Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”), Daniel H.\nHeyns, Thomas Finco, Dennis Straub, Randy Treacher, and Millicent Warren filed the instant\nMotion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment based upon Qualified Immunity.  (ECF No. 11). \nPlaintiffs then filed their response.  (ECF No. 17).  Defendants thereafter filed a reply.  (ECF No.\n18).  \nA hearing on this matter was held on June 20, 2014.  For the following reasons the Court\nwill GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART Defendants’ motion to dismiss and for summary\njudgment. \nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs Amira Salem and Keshuna Abcumby (collectively “Plaintiffs”) brought this\nclass action suit on behalf of all female prisoners who “since October 2010, have been, are now,\n\nor will be hereafter incarcerated by [the Women’s] Huron Valley Correctional Facility and who\nhave been subject to sexual harassment and degrading and unhygienic treatment by MDOC\ncustodial staff.”  (Compl. ¶ 16).  The Court notes that a class has not been certified in this action.\nPlaintiffs have named six defendants in this action.  Defendant Michigan Department of\nCorrections (“MDOC”) is described by Plaintiffs as the department of the State of Michigan\nresponsible for the care and custody of prisoners incarcerated in the State of Michigan.  Plaintiffs\nallege that the MDOC has the responsibility, authority and ability to remedy current and future\nconditions at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility (“WHV”) that gave rise to the\nPlaintiffs’ allegations.\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant Daniel H. Heyns is the director of the MDOC and his\nduties and responsibilities include developing and implementing polices and procedures for the\noperation and management of the MDOC and its employees.  (Compl. ¶ 9).  Plaintiffs contend\nthat he is responsible for the care, custody and protection of prisoners under the jurisdiction of\nthe MDOC. (Id.).\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant Thomas Finco is Deputy Director of the MDOC’s\nCorrectional Facilities Administration (“CFA”) and has served in that capacity since October 1,\n2011.  (Id. at ¶ 10).  Plaintiffs assert that Defendant Finco is responsible for the operation of all\ncorrectional institutions in the MDOC system including “promulgating and administering\nMDOC’s policies.”  (Id.).  Plaintiff allege that Defendant Dennis Straub was the Deputy Director\nof the MDOC’s CFA prior to October 1, 2011 and he had the same responsibilities of Defendant\nFinco.  (Id. at ¶ 11).\n2\n\nPlaintiffs next allege that Defendant Randy Treacher is the Chief Deputy Director of the\nCFA and his duties and responsibilities include the supervision of Defendants Straub and Finco. \n(Id.  ¶ 12).\nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Millicent Warren is the Warden of WHV.  (Id. ¶\n13).  Warren describes her duties and responsibilities as overseeing the overall operation of\nWHV which “includes reviewing policy and practices at WHV and providing input to my\nsupervisor, the Assistant Deputy Director, as well as MDOC central office on existing polices,\nproposed or instituted policy changes as well as operational activities to carry out MDOC\npolicy.”  (Def.’s Br. Ex. A, Warren Aff. ¶ 3).  Warren also attests that she is “the facility\nappointing authority, accountable for hiring, discipline and termination recommendations of\nstaff, budget compliance and physical plan operations.”  (Id.).\nA. Strip Search and Chair Portion of the Strip Search\nPrior to 2009, a standard strip search at a correctional facility that housed female\nprisoners in Michigan was conducted by female correction officers who would require the\nprisoner to “remove her clothing, bend forward, [to] allow[] for a visual inspection of the\nentrance to the vagina and rectal cavity; in such cases, the person [would] be required to bend\nand spread her buttocks, and cough.  The female [officer] then performed a visual check of the\ninmate’s mouth, nose, ears, hair and asked the prisoner to allow the officer clear view of areas\nbehind ears and under breasts.”  (Warren Aff. at ¶ 6).  \nIn 2009, the MDOC consolidated all of its female prisoners into one facility, the WHV. \n(Warren Aff. at ¶ 7).  At that time the MDOC instituted what the Court shall refer to as “the chair\nportion of the strip search” in which a female prisoner must sit on a chair, open her knees, and\n3\n\nspread her labia to expose her vaginal cavity for a visual inspection by correction officers. \n(Compl. ¶ 25).  These types of searches were performed after a prisoner returned from an off-site\nvisit (including hospital visits or leaving the prison on writ) and after each “contact visit” (i.e. a\nvisit in which a prisoner was allowed physical contact with her visitors).  (Warren Aff., Ex. C-1,\nPolicy Directive, 04.04.110, at 4).  Plaintiffs contend that the communal chairs on which they\nwere required to sit were “unwashed and unsanitized”, were not lined with sanitary paper, and\nwere “wet with bodily fluids from other prisoners”.  (Id.).  Plaintiffs allege that female prisoners\nwho suffered from communicable diseases such as “HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis C,\nsexually transmitted diseases, and other vaginal infections” were all subject to the chair portion\nof the strip search while on their menstrual cycles which resulted in blood being left on the\ncommunal chairs used during the strip searches.  (Id. ¶ 26). \nDefendants further clarified that the chair portion of the strip search was also used on the\nEast Side of WHV prior to Defendant Millicent Warren’s appointment as warden in 2009. \n(Def.’s Reply, Ex. A, Supp. Warren Supp. Aff. at ¶ 4).  In 2009, with the consolidation of all the\nwomen’s correctional facilities into one facility, the WHV, the MDOC determined that the chair\nportion of the strip searches would also be implemented at the West Side of WHV.  (Id.). \nDefendants contend that the decision to use the chair portion of the strip search was an attempt\n“to better comply with the search depicted in the 1998 training video which showed how a\nproper strip search of female offenders was to be done.  The additional step of using a chair was\nadded because of the awareness that females could hide contraband in their vagina.”  (Warren\nAff. at ¶ 8; Ex. B, 1998 Training Video).  Further the “MDOC, at the time, believed that\nincorporating a chair into the routine strip search procedure would aid staff in performing a more\n4\n\nthorough search for contraband and to better comply with MDOC policy on strip searches.” \n(Id.).  \nThe 1998 training video, supplied under seal by Defendants, depicts how to conduct a\nstrip search pursuant to PD 04-04-110, and instructs that during a routine strip search the female\ninmate is “required to sit and spread the lips of her vagina”.  The training video further advises\nthat any tampon or sanitary napkin must be removed to allow the officer to visually search the\nvaginal opening.  The training video is silent as to maintaining sanitary conditions or preventing\nthe spread of communicable diseases.  (See Ex. B, Training Video). \nPlaintiffs claim that the chair portion of the strip search was actually promulgated to\nretaliate against the female prisoners at WHV following the 2009 settlement of an unrelated\ncourt case, Neal, et al. v. MDOC, et al., case no. 96-6986-CZ, in which many female residents of\nWHV were plaintiffs.  (Pls.’ Resp. Ex. 4, Salem Aff. at ¶ 10, “I believe the institution of these\nsearches was in direct retaliation for the Neal v MDOC case and its settlement agreement in\n2009.”).  In support of this theory, both Plaintiffs attest that they were not subjected to the chair\nportion of the strip search until 2009.  (Salem Aff. at ¶ 5; Abcumby Aff. at ¶¶ 2-3).  Plaintiff\nSalem attested that she has been housed at WHV since 2005.  (ECF No. 19, Supp. Salem Aff. at\n¶¶ 3-4).   Plaintiff Salem attests that she is not aware of any other female prisoner at WHV that\nwas subject to the chair portion of the strip search prior to 2009. (ECF No. 19, Supp. Salem Aff.\nat ¶¶ 4, 6-7). \nB. Factual Allegations as to the Named Plaintiffs\nPlaintiff Salem alleges that in 2009 through early 2012 she was subject to the chair\nportion of the strip searches and she was “ordered to get completely naked, sit on an unsanitized\n5\n\nchair, open her legs wide, and manually open her labia to allow correctional officers to peer into\nher vagina.”  (Compl. ¶ 40; see also ECF No. 19, Supp. Salem Aff. at ¶ 5).  Plaintiff Salem is\nMuslim and asserts that her religion prohibits women from exposing themselves in that manner\nrequired by the chair portion of the strip search.  (Compl. ¶ 41).  Plaintiff Salem also alleges that\nshe has been exposed to communicable diseases because of the chair portion of the strip search\nand has suffered from anxiety attacks, flashbacks of sexual abuse, psychological and mental\ndistress and also avoided family and religious visitations due to the effects of the chair portion of\nthe strip search.  (Id. at ¶ 42; Pls.’ Resp. Ex. 4, Salem Aff. at ¶¶ 13, 15).\nPlaintiff Keshuna Abcumby alleges that between 2009 and 2012 she was subject to the\nchair portion of the strip search ten times, and on some occasions she was made to “hold her\nknees up and cough, as if pushing to deliver a baby.”  (Compl. ¶ 45; Pls.’ Resp. Ex. 4, Abcumby\nAff. at ¶ 3).  Plaintiff Abcumby also claims that on occasion, disinfectant spray was made\navailable to clean the chair used in the strip search but that the spray was not allowed sufficient\ntime to remain on the chair to work effectively per the label instructions.  (Compl. at ¶ 46). \nPlaintiff Abcumby alleges that because of these searches she has suffered multiple vaginal\nbacteria infections, anxiety attacks, flashbacks of sexual abuse, nightmare, night sweats, nausea,\nvomiting, abnormal menstrual cycles, headaches, high blood pressure, and psychological and\nmental distress.”  (Id. ¶ 47; Abcumby Aff. ¶¶ 10, 14).  \nC. MDOC Memoranda regarding the Chair Portion of The Strip Search \nDefendants acknowledge that during 2010 and 2011 they became aware of complaints\nfrom the inmates at WHV regarding the chair portion of the strip search.  (Warren Aff. ¶ 9). \nDefendants assert that they received 67 grievances regarding some aspect of the chair portion of\n6\n\nthe strip search and they also received 30 complaints to WHV psychological services regarding\nthe same with possible overlap between the inmates that filed the grievances and the inmates that\ncomplained to psychological services.  (Id. at 11; Ex. A, 12/14/11 Memo at 5).  Plaintiffs dispute\nDefendants’ accounting of grievances and claim that as of December 14, 2011 there were more\nthan 70 grievances filed and also claim that the total number of grievances filed regarding the\nchair portion of the strip search exceeds 500.  (Pls.’ Resp. at 8; Pls.’ Resp., Ex. 4, Appendix of\ninmates who have filed grievances concerning the chair portion of the strip search both before\nand after December 14, 2011).1  Further, Plaintiffs allege that many grievances filed on this issue\nwere rejected because MDOC does not allow inmates to challenge policies and procedures and\nthere is no alternative mechanism to exhaust the claims in the Complaint.  (Compl. ¶ 36).\nDefendants state that in response to the 67 grievances and 30 complaints to psychological\nservices, Warren began an administrative fact finding and review process regarding the\n“necessity of continuing the chair portion of the strip search.”  (Warren Aff. ¶¶ 4, 12). \nAdditionally, on June 3, 2011, Warren issued a Memorandum regarding the 04-04-110 Policy\nDirective.  (Defs.’ Br., Ex. B, 6/3/11 Memo), which stated that effective immediately the\nlanguage in the 04-04-110 Policy Directive regarding “Search and Arrest at Women’s Huron\nValley Correctional Facility” under the heading “Searches” would read as follows:\n1 Plaintiffs state in their response that there are more than 500 grievances and refer to\ntheir exhibit 4, which is a numbered list of inmate names and corresponding inmate numbers. \nPlaintiffs represent that this is a list of all of the names of inmates that have filed grievances\nconcerning the chair portion of the strip search both before and after December 14, 2011. \nPlaintiffs argue that the number of grievances filed before December 14, 2011 is more than 70,\nhowever it is unclear from the record what number of grievances were filed prior to December\n14, 2011.\n7\n\n3. Strip Search: Visual inspection of all body surfaces of a person who has been\nrequired to remove all or most of his/her clothing and jewelry for purposes of the\nsearch.  This includes visual inspection of the mouth, ears, and nasal cavities. \nUnless determined by the Warden to be unnecessary for an assignment within the\nsecurity perimeter which requires a strip search (e.g., Michigan State Industries),\nit also includes visual inspection of the entrance to the vagina and rectal cavity; in\nsuch cases, the person will be required to bend and spread her buttocks and sit on\na sanitary paper lined chair and spread her knees so as to spread the lips of her\nvagina to allow inspection.  All clothing and articles which are removed also shall\nbe inspected for contraband.\nNOTE: If necessary, the prisoner may be required to manually spread the lips of\nher vagina with her hands.  If this procedure is necessary, the prisoner will be\nallowed to sanitize their hands before and after this procedure with an approve[d]\nsanitizer.   \n(6/3/11 Memo).2  Warren went on to state in the June 3, 2011 memorandum that an approved\nsanitizer would be located in each strip search room and “shall be available whenever a strip\nsearch needs to be performed”.  (Id.).\nThen on December 14, 2011, in response to the 67 grievances and 30 complaints to\npsychological services and as a result of her fact-finding investigation, Warren issued a fifteen\npage memorandum on the issue of whether the “‘chair portion of the regular post contact visit\n2 Although unclear, it appears that the language in Policy Directive 04-04-110, effective\non April 24, 2009 (and through June 3, 2011) defined “Strip Search” under the heading\n“Searches”, in relevant part, a “[Strip Search] also includes visual inspection of the entrance to\nthe vagina and rectal cavity; in such cases, the person will be required to bend and spread his/her\nbuttocks, and spread the lips of her vagina, to allow inspection.  All clothing and articles which\nare removed also shall be inspected for contraband.”  (Warren Aff., Ex. C-1, PD 04-04-100, Eff.\n4/24/09).  There is no mention of a chair being used in this procedure.  However, in Operating\nProcedure 04-04-110, effective May 1, 2009, a “Strip Search” is defined, in relevant part, as\n“[Strip Search] also includes visual inspection of the entrance to the vagina and rectal cavity; in\nsuch cases, the person will be required to bend and spread her buttocks and sit on a sanitary\npaper lined chair and spread her knees so as to spread the lips of her vagina to allow inspection. \nAll clothing and articles which are removed also shall be inspected for contraband.”  (Warren\nAff, Ex. C-2, OP 04-04-110, Eff. 5/01/09).\n8\n\nstrip search be continued as a matter of routine?”  (Warren Aff., Ex. A, 12/14/11 Memo at 1).  In\nthe memo, Warren recounted the history of the chair portion of the strip search stating that the\nchair portion of the strip search was “instituted in an effort to operate the facility in complete\naccord with MDOC policy” specifically a 1998 training video which provided that female\ninmates should sit and spread the lips of their vagina for visual inspection during a routine strip\nsearch.  (Id.; see also Ex. B, 1998 Training Video).  Warren also explained that “MDOC Central\nOffice, after discussion with the WHV warden, decided the use of the chair and visual inspection\nof the vaginal opening was an important part of the strip search of female prisoners after contact\nvisits ...”  (12/14/11 Memo at 2). The December 14, 2011 Memo then addressed six factors that\nWarren considered regarding whether to continue the chair portion of the routine strip search. \n(Id. at 3).  \nThe first factor considered was random drug/urine test results of the WHV inmates from\n12/31/09 through 8/23/11.  These results offered no evidence regarding the efficacy of the search\nmethod, however, because the chair portion of the strip search had been in use since the facility’s\nconsolidation, so there were no results for comparison.  The second factor Warren investigated\nwas the “comments from mental health services” regarding prisoner complaints or suggestions of\nharm due to participating in the chair portion of the strip search.  (Id. at 4-5).  Warren noted that\ninterviews with members of the mental health services revealed that mental health services had\nreceived approximately 25-30 complaints regarding the chair portion of the strip search.  (Id. at\n5).  One health services member noted that he received “a number” of complaints in early 2009\nwhen the practice was first introduced but had received “few recent complaints”.  (Id.).  Warren\nstated that the complaints only constituted 1.7% of the prisoner population, and further noted that\n9\n\nthe fact that the members interviewed could not identify any prisoner who they believed suffered\npsychological harm or was injured as a result of the policy meant any complaints made were not\n“persistent.”  (Id. 5-6).  Another health services member interviewed noted that two or three\nprisoners “claimed that the strip search exacerbated trauma from pre-prison sexual abuse that\nthey had experienced.”  (Id. at 6).  That doctor “found these complaints plausible.  He noted, that\nthe experience of the chair portion of the strip search could theoretically ‘refresh’ or ‘reawaken’\nthe experience of past sexual abuse in some prisoner patients.”  (12/14/11 Memo at 6).  Warren\nconcluded that the mental health professionals would describe the chair portion of the strip\nsearch as a “stressor” that was more than a minor irritation but “less than an event that actually\ncaused psychological harm o[r] damage in and of itself.”  (Id. at 6-7). \nThe third factor Warren considered were the grievances filed by prisoners that mentioned\nthe chair portion of the strip search “as objectionable.”  (Id. at 7).  Warren stated that the\n(approximate) 673 grievances represented 4% of the total population that were allowed contact\nvisits, and also noted that 96% of the grievances related specifically to the chair portion of the\nstrip search and the requirement that inmates spread their labia for the female officers to inspect. \nIn those grievances, the prisoners stated they felt “degraded”, “humiliated”, “sexualized” and\nuncomfortable with having to touch themselves.  (Id.).  Warren then noted that WHV\n“attempted” to make sure the strip search rooms had gloves, sanitary chair covers, paper towels,\ndisinfectant, trash cans and hand sanitizer, but noted that 42% of the grievances claimed that the\nchair portion of the strip search was unsanitary.  (Id.).  \n3 The briefing also represents that the number of grievances filed was 69.\n10\n\nWarren next examined the log of voluntary non-contact visits and found that prisoners\ndid not utilize a non-contact visit option that would allow them to avoid the chair portion of the\nstrip search altogether.  (Id. at 8).  Therefore, Warren concluded that the strip search was not a\nsignificant inhibitor to participating in contact visits because inmates overwhelming chose to\nhave a contact visit even when the visitor was a friend, clergy or unfamiliar volunteer rather than\navoiding the strip search by opting to have a non-contact visit.  (Id. at 8-9).  \nWarren also surveyed officers who conducted the strip searches on inmates after contact\nvisits.  (12/14/11 Memo at 9-10).  Of the officers surveyed, 75% believed that the chair portion\nof the strip search was not necessary for the security of the facility.  (Id. at 10).  Additionally,\n100% of the officers surveyed believed they could conduct a strip search effectively without\nrequiring the prisoner sit on a chair.  (Id.).  Finally, 63% of the officers surveyed answered that\nyes, they believed the chair portion of the strip search could be “conducted in a way that\nmaintains your and the prisoner’s dignity and self-respect.”  (Id. at 10-11).\nThe last factor considered by Warren was the fact that since the policy began there had\nbeen only one instance of contraband being found in an inmate’s vagina.  (Id. at 11).  However,\nthe contraband (a pair of earrings) was not found during the chair portion of the strip search but\nrather during the portion of the strip search when an inmate is required to bend over, spread her\nbuttocks and cough.  (Id.).  Also, that inmate had just arrived from a different jail and she was\nlikely unaware of WHV’s routine strip search policy.  (Id. at 11-12).\nWarren summarized her findings in the memorandum, concluding: \n[o]n balance the increased security benefit provided by the use of the chair\nportion of the strip search, on the present data may not be sufficiently great to\nrequire, even though it allows, the modest stressor of continued use of the chair\nportion of the routine post contact visit strip search. ... the chair portion of the\n11\n\nstrip search appears viewed by both prisoners and the staff conducting the strip\nsearches as an unnecessary irritation.  Therefore, I have decided to suspend the\nroutine use of the chair portion of the strip search following contact visits\neffective Friday, December 16, 2011.\n(12/14/11 Memo at 14-15; see also Pls.’ Resp. Ex. 2, 12/13/11 Notice to Staff stating the chair\nportion of the strip search is “no longer authorized” as of 12/16/2011).\nD. MDOC’s Current Policy \nWarren attests that after December 16, 2011 the chair portion of the strip search has not\n“been regularly employed by WHV staff, pursuant to the current policy.”  (Warren Aff. ¶ 15). \nWarren further asserts that she has no intention of re-instituting the policy “on a routine basis,\nabsent some exigent circumstance”.  (Id. at ¶ 16).\nPlaintiffs dispute that the chair portion of the strip search no longer occurs and claim that\nthe chair portion of the strip search was utilized against them at some point in 2012 at WHV. \n(See Abcumby Aff. at ¶ 15, “I have been subjected to similar searches throughout the years of\n2011 and 2012.”; Salem Aff. at ¶ 5, “I have been subjected to the spread-labia vaginal inspection\nsearch at least 5 times between 2009 and 2012.”).  Plaintiffs also point to an attached appendix\nof inmate names who have allegedly filed 500 grievances regarding the chair portion of the strip\nsearch both before and after the date it was allegedly abrogated to illustrate that the search\nprocedure is still being used.  (See Pls.’ Resp., Ex. 4, Appendix).  However, it is unclear from the\nindex the date of when those grievances were filed as only the names of the inmates are\nprovided.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nDefendants style their present motion as a motion to dismiss pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P.\n12(b)(6) and also as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). \n12\n\nRule 12(b)(6) allows for the dismissal of a case where the complaint fails to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.  When reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a\ncourt must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept its\nallegations as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.” DirectTV, Inc. v.\nTreesh, 487 F.3d 471, 476 (6th Cir. 2007).  But the court “need not accept as true legal\nconclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.” Id. (quoting Gregory v. Shelby County, 220 F.3d\n433, 446 (6th Cir. 2000)).  “[L]egal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not\nsuffice.” Eidson v. State of Term. Dep’t of Children's Servs., 510 F.3d 631, 634 (6th Cir. 2007). \nThe Supreme Court explained that “a plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds' of his\n‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of\nthe elements of a cause of action will not do.  Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right\nto relief above the speculative level....”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\n(2007) (internal citations omitted).  Dismissal is only appropriate if the plaintiff has failed to\noffer sufficient factual allegations that make the asserted claim plausible on its face.  Id. at 570.\nPursuant to Rule 56(a), a court “shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).  The moving party bears the initial burden of showing that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact, but once this burden is met, the opposing party must\nproduce some facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.  Matsushita Elec. Indust. Co. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 547, 587 (1986).  The Court must view the facts and draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 255 (1986).  “[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties\n13\n\nwill not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement\nis that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  Id. at 247-48 (emphasis in original). \nPursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(d), on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), when\n“matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must\nbe treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  In the present motion, Defendants\nattach and rely upon affidavits, a training video, as well as pertinent MDOC memoranda, and\npolicy and operating directives.  Plaintiffs’ response to the motion further relies upon affidavit\ntestimony of the Plaintiffs, memoranda, policy directives, and an appendix of inmate names that\nallegedly correspond to grievances filed regarding the chair portion of the strip search procedure. \nTherefore, to the extent that this Court relies upon Defendants’ and Plaintiffs’ proffered\nevidence, the Court construes Defendants’ motion as one for summary judgment under FED. R.\nCIV. P. 56(a). \nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Eleventh Amendment \nPlaintiffs’ complaint, in establishing proper jurisdiction, notes specifically that\n“Defendants named herein as public officials of the State of Michigan [are] sued in their official\nand individual capacities for violations of Plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional rights.” \n(Compl. ¶ 5).  Plaintiffs’ complaint also provides that in addition to costs, expenses, and\ndamages (including punitive damages), Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against\nDefendants prohibiting them from “subjecting Plaintiffs to polices and procedures that violate\ntheir constitutional statutory rights, and common law rights”, and remediation of certain prison\nconditions (namely the prohibition of the chair portion of the strip search).  (Compl. at *14). \n14\n\nDefendants contend that to the extent that Plaintiffs’ claims are brought against the\nindividual defendants in their official capacities for money damages, those claims are barred\npursuant to the Eleventh Amendment.  Plaintiffs concede this point, noting that “[t]he MDOC is\na state agency and is therefore entitled to sovereign immunity from Plaintiff’s [sic] suit for\nmonetary damages” and that “Eleventh Amendment immunity extends to state officials or\nemployees sued in their official capacities.”  (Pls.’ Resp. at 11).  Indeed, it is well settled that\nwhen a plaintiff seeks monetary damages from individual defendants in their official capacities,\nthose claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Thiokol Corp. v. Dep’t of Treas., 987 F.2d\n376, 381 (6th Cir. 1993); Evans v. Vinson, 427 F. App’x 437, 441 (6th Cir. 2011) (recognizing\nthe same).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims insofar as they seek money damages against the MDOC\nor against the individual defendants sued in their official capacity are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment.4 \nHowever, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits against government officials sued\nin their official capacities for prospective injunctive relief.  Therefore, as Plaintiffs also appear to\nbe seeking prospective injunctive relief against the Defendant officials in their official capacity\nand these claims are not barred.  See Will v. Mich Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 n. 10\n(1989) (citation omitted); see also Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908); Pucci v. 19th\nDistrict Court, 628 F.3d 752, 765 (6th Cir. 2010) Sutton v. Evans, 918 F.2d 654, 657 (6th Cir.\n1990).\n4 Plaintiffs request the chance to amend their complaint if it is unclear whether they are\nsuing the individual Defendants in their official and individual capacities.  However, Plaintiffs\nexplicitly set forth in their complaint that they are suing the individual officers in both their\nindividual and official capacities so there is no need for Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. \n15\n\nB. Section 1983\nTo establish a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must assert that a right\nsecured by the Constitution or a federal law has been violated, and that the violation was caused\nby a person acting under the color of state law.  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).  “Persons\nsued in their individual capacities under 1983 can be held liable based only on their own\nunconstitutional behavior.”  Heyerman v. County of Calhoun, 680 F.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(citations omitted).  “This court has held that § 1983 liability must be based on more than\nrespondeat superior, or the right to control employees.”  Shehee v. Luttrell, 199 F.3d 295, 300\n(6th Cir. 2005).  In the present action there appears to be no dispute that the Defendants acted\nunder the color of state law with regards to any action they took with regards to the strip search\npolicy.  Therefore, the only issues that remain are whether the Defendants deprived the Plaintiffs\nof any rights protected by the Constitution or federal law.  \n1. Possible Fourteenth Amendment Claims\nDefendants argue that to the extent Plaintiffs claim a violation of their substantive due\nprocess rights in connection with the chair portion of the strip search it is the Eighth\nAmendment, and not the Fourteenth Amendment, that is the proper source of that protection\nbecause it is the “primary source of protection against the wanton infliction of pain”.  (Defs.’ Br.\nat 19).  Defendants cite Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986) for this proposition.  In Whitley,\nthe Supreme Court found that the Eighth Amendment is the primary source of substantive\nprotection for convicted prisoners against the wanton infliction of pain “in cases such as this one,\nwhere the deliberate use of force is challenged as excessive and unjustified [under the Fourth\nAmendment].”  Id. at 327.  Here, however, it appears that any Fourteenth Amendment claim\n16\n\nPlaintiffs assert in their complaint is asserted in conjunction with her Fourth Amendment claim\nbased on a violation of Plaintiffs’ right to privacy, not an excessive force claim.  (See Compl. at\n¶¶ 57–64).  Therefore, Defendants’ argument that Eighth Amendment is controlling is off the\nmark.  \nThe Defendants are correct, however, that where an explicit textual source of\nconstitutional protection exists, that source rather than the more generalized notion of\nsubstantive due process is the guide for analyzing the claim.  Walker v. Norris, 917 F.2d 1449\n(6th Cir. 1990); see also Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994).  The Sixth Circuit has\nexplicitly recognized a prisoner’s “‘privacy’ right against the forced exposure of one's body to\nstrangers of the opposite sex [as being] located in the Fourth Amendment.” Everson v. MDOC,\n391 F.3d 737, 757 n. 26 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 916 (6th\nCir. 1992)); see also Stoudemire v. MDOC, 705 F.3d 560, 572 (6th Cir. 2013) (providing that\n“we have noted, ‘a convicted prisoner maintains some reasonable expectations of privacy while\nin prison ... even though those privacy rights may be less than those enjoyed by non-prisoners.”\n(quoting Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 916)).  In this action, Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are based\non alleged violations of their right to privacy and those rights are explicitly located in the Fourth\nAmendment (and made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).  Therefore,\nthe Court will analyze Plaintiffs’ claims through the framework of the Fourth Amendment rather\nthan the more generalized notion of substantive due process pursuant to the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\nMoreover, Plaintiffs fail to address Defendants’ argument regarding a possible\nFourteenth Amendment due process claim whatsoever.  Indeed, Plaintiffs failed to differentiate\n17\n\nany possible Fourteenth Amendment due process claim from their Fourth or Eighth Amendment\nclaim in their response or during oral argument.  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have\nabandoned any due process claim pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment arising under the facts\nalleged in this action.  See Brown v. VHS of Mich., Inc., 545 F. App’x 368, 372 (6th Cir. 2013)\n(holding “[t]his Court’s jurisprudence on abandonment of claims is clear: a plaintiff is deemed to\nhave abandoned a claim when a plaintiff fails to address it in response to a motion for summary\njudgment.”) (collecting cases)). \n2. Eighth Amendment Claim and Qualified Immunity \nPlaintiffs’ assert that the individual Defendants violated their Eighth Amendment rights. \nThe individual Defendants claim that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs’\nEighth Amendment claim.  \nThe doctrine of qualified immunity generally protects “government officials performing\ndiscretionary functions ... from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  The purpose of qualified\nimmunity is to “shield the official from suit altogether, saving him or her from the burdens of\ndiscovery and costs of trial.”  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).  Qualified immunity\nprotects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”  Humphrey v.\nMabry, 482 F.3d. 840, 847 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)). \nA government official is entitled to qualified immunity “unless a plaintiff pleads facts\nshowing: “(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right and (2) that the right\n18\n\nwas ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.”5  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, --- U.S. ---\n, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011) (citation omitted).  The order of the inquiry is no longer\nmandatory and Courts are allowed to use their discretion in deciding which of the two steps of\nthe qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first.  Id. (citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555\nU.S. 223, 236 (2009)).  Once a government official has raised the defense of qualified immunity,\nthe plaintiff must bear the burden to demonstrate that the defense is unwarranted.  Roth v.\nGuzman, 650 F.3d 603, 609 (6th Cir. 2007).  A constitutional right is clearly established when “it\nwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).  “But under either prong, courts may\nnot resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment.”  Tolan v.\nCotton, --- U.S. ---, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1866 (2014). \nAs to whether the individual Defendants violated the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights,\nPlaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ “implementation” of the chair portion of the strip search\nviolates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and that the Defendants “failed to\nadequately train, supervise and/or institute and implement adequate policies and procedure to\nconduct searches constitutes deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ health, safety, privacy and\nbodily integrity in violation” of the Eighth Amendment.  (Compl. ¶¶ 50, 52).  Plaintiffs allege\nthat Defendants are “individually liable” for these Eighth Amendment violations because “they\nand/or their agents (1) participated in creating and carrying out the unconstitutional policies that\ncaused the harm to each Plaintiff; (2) failed to take necessary steps to ensure the safety and\n5 Some Sixth Circuit panels have also used a “third step requiring the court to determine\nwhether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly\ndid was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established right.” Grawey v. Drury, 567\nF.3d 302, 309 (6th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). \n19\n\nwell[-]being of each Plaintiff; and (3) implicitly authorized, approved or knowing[ly] acquiesced\nin the unconstitutional conduct of offending MDOC staff.”  (Compl. ¶ 53).\nPlaintiffs’ claims regarding violations of the Eighth Amendment relate to the conditions\nof confinement at WHV as they claim the conditions relating to the chair portion of the strip\nsearch were unsanitary.  The Supreme Court has recognized that prison conditions can constitute\na cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment if those conditions lead to\n“deprivations of essential food, medical care, or sanitation.”  Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337,\n348 (1981).  Moreover, prison “[c]onditions must not involve the wanton and unnecessary\ninfliction of pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime\nwarranting imprisonment.”  Id. at 347.  \n“[A] prison official violates the Eighth Amendment only when two requirements are met. \nFirst, the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, “sufficiently serious,” such that “a prison\nofficial’s act or omission must result in the denial of ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s\nnecessities’” or that an inmate is “incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of\nserious harm.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 (internal citation omitted); see also Barker v. Goodrich,\n649 F.3d 428, 434 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding same).  The second, subjective, requirement is that\nthe prison official must have a “culpable state of mind”; “[i]n prison-conditions cases[,] that state\nof mind is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.”  Id. (citations omitted). \n“Satisfying the objective component ensures that the alleged deprivation is sufficiently severe,\nwhile satisfying the subjective component ‘ensures that the defendant prison official acted with a\nsufficiently culpable state of mind.’” Quigley v. Tuong Vinh Thai, 707 F.3d 675, 681 (6th Cir.\n2013) (quoting Smith v. Carpenter, 316 F.3d 178, 183-84 (2d Cir. 2003)).\n20\n\na.  Objective Component \nThe Court need not reach the question of whether the possibility of exposure to\ncommunicable diseases as alleged in this action constitutes a “sufficiently serious” risk of\nserious harm because the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot establish the subjective component of\nthe Eighth Amendment inquiry as to the individual liability of the Defendants as examined,\ninfra.\nb. Subjective Component\nThe Court notes that “it is well-settled that qualified immunity must be assessed in the\ncontext of each individual’s specific conduct.”  Stoudemire v. MDOC, 705 F.3d 560, 570 (6th\nCir. 2013) (quotation omitted).  Therefore, “the question of whether an official possessed the\nrequisite knowledge and culpable mental state to sustain a deliberate indifference claim ‘must be\naddressed for each officer individually.’”  Id. (quoting Garretson v. City of Madison Heights,\n407 F.3d 789, 797 (6th Cir. 2005)).  In regard to the subjective element, an officer must have\n“both be[en] aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exist[ed], he must also [have] draw[n] the inference.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. \n“An officer’s knowledge of the risk may be demonstrated through circumstantial evidence and\ninference, and ‘a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from\nthe very fact that the risk was obvious.’” Barker, 649 F.3d at 434 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n842). \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that the individual Defendants “failed to adequately train,\nsupervise and/or institute and implement adequate policies and procedures” such that their\nEighth Amendment rights were violated.  (Compl. ¶ 52).  Supervisory officials, however, “are\n21\n\nnot liable in their individual capacities unless they ‘either encouraged the specific incident of\nmisconduct or in some other way directly participated in it.  At a minimum, a plaintiff must show\nthat the official at least implicitly authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in the\nunconstitutional conduct of the offending officers.’” Heyerman v. County of Calhoun, 680 F.3d\n642, 647 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Hayes v. Jefferson Cnty., 668 F.2d 869, 872 (6th Cir. 1982)). \nIndeed, § 1983 liability “must be based on more than respondeat superior, or the right to control\nemployees.”  Shehee v. Luttrell, 199 F.3d 295, 300 (6th Cir. 1999).  \n1. Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher\nIn the present action, Plaintiffs have failed to evidence or allege any particularized facts\nagainst Defendants Daniel H. Heyns, Thomas Finco, Dennis Straub, or Randy Treacher beyond\ntheir general job descriptions.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have not made any arguments or set forth any\nfacts on the part of Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, or Treacher in the Complaint, their\nresponse, or during oral argument regarding these Defendants’ individual state of minds such\nthat they were both aware of facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk\nof harm existed to the Plaintiffs or that they actually drew that inference.6  Stoudemire, 705 F.3d\nat 570 (“it is well-settled that qualified immunity must be assessed in the context of each\nindividual’s specific conduct.” (citation omitted)); Heyerman, 680 F.3d at 647 (“[p]ersons sued\nin their individual capacities under § 1983 can be held liable based only on their own\nunconstitutional behavior.”).  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not address or differentiate the conduct of\n6 Indeed, Plaintiffs’ argument in their Response brief states only that the “MDOC was on\nactual notice that the inmates were being subjected to unnecessary psychological and physical\nharm” and that the MDOC ignored and “condoned them and perpetuated their continuance”. \n(Pls.’ Resp. at 19).  Further, Plaintiffs only separately address Defendant Warren, arguing that\nshe was deliberately indifferent in her actions.  (Id.).  \n22\n\nthese individual officers whatsoever.  Where Plaintiffs have failed to address or make any\narguments regarding Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher, those Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity.\nMoreover, the failure to separately address these individual Defendants or make any\narguments regarding their personal involvement indicates that Plaintiffs’ attempt to sue them in\ntheir individual capacities is merely a fiction.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendants\nHeyns, Finco, Straub, or Treacher appear to be lodged against these defendants in their official\ncapacity and/or  “improperly conflate[] a § 1983 claim of individual supervisory liability with\none of municipal liability.”  Phillips v. Roane Cnty., Tenn., 534 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(reasoning that allegations regarding officers were not properly trained were “more appropriately\nsubmitted as evidence to support a failure-to-train theory against the municipality itself, and not\nthe supervisors in their individual capacities.”); see also Heyerman, 680 F.3d at 647 (holding\nthat a plaintiff’s attempt to hold a prosecuting attorney liable in her individual capacity for the\ncontinuation of a policy or following of a policy improperly conflated a § 1983 claim “of\nindividual supervisory liability with one of municipal liability”); Miller v. Calhoun Cnty., 408\nF.3d 803, 817 n. 3 (6th Cir. 2005) (noting that where a plaintiff failed to allege or present any\nevidence that the individual defendants had any personal involvement in the alleged underlying\nmisconduct, a “failure-to-train” claim lodged against those individual defendants was properly\nconstrued as a claim against the individuals in their official capacities, which in turn is treated as\na claims against the county.); see also Broyles v. Corr. Med. Services, Inc., 478 F. App’x 971,\n977 n. 1 (6th Cir. 2012) (noting that allegations regarding a prison supervisor’s implementation\nof a policy or practice would be relevant to the prison official’s liability in his official capacity.).  \n23\n\n2. Defendant Warren \nPlaintiffs more specifically allege that Defendant Warren was personally involved in the\ncreation and implementation of the chair portion of the strip search policy.  (Compl. ¶¶ 13-15). \nIt is undisputed that Defendant Warren was personally aware of 67 grievances filed by prisoners\nregarding the practice and some 30 complaints to WHV psychological services and decided to\ninvestigate the issue in 2011.  (Warren Aff. ¶¶ 9-11).  To that end, Defendant Warren issued two\nmemoranda regarding the chair portion of the strip search, the first in June 2011 specifying that\ncertain procedures must be followed to ensure sanitary conditions, and in December 2011\nproviding the results of her investigation and concluding that the chair portion of the strip search\nwould no longer be routinely practiced as of December 16, 2011.  (Ex. B, 6/3/2011 Memo;\n12/14/2011 Memo).  \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs argue that “[d]espite warnings from psychologists on her\nstaff that the searches could cause severe psychological stress in some female inmates, and\ndespite complaints and grievances concerning the transmission of infection and serious adverse\npsychological impact, the warden still implemented and continued the policy.”  (Pls.’ Resp. at\n19).  However, the record is clear that Defendant Warren became aware of complaints regarding\nthe chair portion of the search in 2010 and 2011 which spurred “an administrative fact finding\nand review” regarding the procedure which included seeking opinions of the psychologists on\nher staff.  (Warren Aff. ¶¶ 11-14).  As a result of that inquiry, and after receiving the opinions of\nher staff psychologists on her staff, Defendant Warren formally abandoned the policy.  (12/14/11\nMemo).  Additionally, ostensibly because of these same complaints, by April 2011 Defendant\nWarren required that a disposable seat cover be used and hand sanitizer be available during the\n24\n\nchair portion of the strip search.  (Warren Aff. ¶ 10).  On June 3, 2011, the language of the\nOperating Procedure 04.04.110 was changed to reflect these changes.  (Ex. B, 6/3/2011 Memo). \nFinally, during the fact finding review, Defendant Warren directed the staff to “allow prisoners\nwho did not want to be subject to a strip search following a contact visit, to be allowed to choose\na non-contact visit.”  (Id. ¶ 13; Ex. D, 4/5/2011 Memo).    \nThe Supreme Court has provided that “prison officials who act reasonably cannot be\nfound liable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause”.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845. \nIndeed, “prison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may\nbe found free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately\nwas not averted.”  Id. at 844; see also Street v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 102 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir.\n1996) (quoting same).  Even when viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the present facts\ncannot establish that Defendant Warren was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ Eighth\nAmendment rights in regards to the chair portion of the strip search.  Indeed, Plaintiffs cannot\ndispute that Defendant Warren’s response to complaints regarding the chair portion of the strip\nsearch was reasonable given that she officially changed the policy and instituted sanitary\npractices.  Accordingly, Defendant Warren, in her individual capacity, is entitled to qualified\nimmunity from Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim where Plaintiffs cannot establish a\nconstitutional violation on her part where the record reflects her knowledge of prisoner’s\ncomplaints, her inquiry in to the matter, her actions to make the search sanitary, and her direction\nthat prisoners could choose to avoid the chair portion of the search by foregoing contact visits,\nand her formal abandonment of the policy. \n25\n\n3. Fourth Amendment Claims and Qualified Immunity\nThe Court notes that is it unclear from Defendants’ initial briefing whether they were\nseeking qualified immunity for Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims based on violations of the Fourth\nAmendment.  However, Plaintiffs assumed as much in their Response and Defendants noted in\nboth their Reply brief (at 4) and stated during their oral argument that the individual Defendants\nare seeking qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim.  \nAs stated previously, a government official is entitled to qualified immunity and is\nshielded from money damages “unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing: “(1) that the official\nviolated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the\ntime of the challenged conduct.”  al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at  2080 (citation omitted).  The order of\nthis inquiry is no longer mandatory.  See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236.  Again, this Court stresses\nthat qualified immunity must be assessed on an individual basis.  Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 570\n(“it is well-settled that qualified immunity must be assessed in the context of each individual’s\nspecific conduct.” (citation omitted)); Heyerman, 680 F.3d at 647 (“[p]ersons sued in their\nindividual capacities under § 1983 can be held liable based only on their own unconstitutional\nbehavior.”).\nA. Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher\nIn the context of their Fourth Amendment claims, Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants are\nindividually liable for the “unconstitutional conditions” at WHV because they “(1) participated\nin creating and carrying out the unconstitutional policies that caused harm to each Plaintiff; (2)\nfailed to take necessary steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of each Plaintiff; and (3)\nimplicitly authorized, approved or knowing[ly] acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of\n26\n\noffending MDOC staff.”  (Compl. at ¶ 61).  However, Plaintiffs fail to carry their burden in\nshowing the individual Defendants, Heyns, Finco, Straub and Treacher, are not entitled to\nqualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claims, where they have failed to differentiate the\nindividual conduct of these Defendants.  See Roth, 650 F.3d at 609 (holding that it is plaintiff’s\nburden to show that the defense of qualified immunity is unwarranted).  As examined supra in\nthe context of Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, qualified immunity must be assessed on an\nindividual basis and specific to each defendant’s conduct.  Here, Plaintiffs have again failed to\nplead any particular facts beyond their general job descriptions connecting Defendants Heyns,\nFinco, Straub and Treacher to their Fourth Amendment allegations.  Therefore, for the same\nreasons Plaintiffs failed to state Eighth Amendment claims against Defendants Heyns, Finco,\nStruab, and Treacher,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state Fourth Amendment\nclaims against Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher and those Defendants are entitled\nto qualified immunity.\nB. Defendant Warren\nPlaintiffs have set forth particular facts and allegations regarding Defendant Warren in\nconnection to their Fourth Amendment claim. \n1. Constitutional Violation  \nIt well settled that the Sixth Circuit recognizes that “a convicted prisoner maintains some\nreasonable expectations of privacy while in prison ... even though those privacy rights may be\nless than those enjoyed by non-prisoners.”  Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 916 (6th Cir.\n1992) (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979) and Kent v. Johnson, 821 F.2d 1220,\n1226-27 (6th Cir. 1987)) (acknowledging that a prisoner “particularly” maintains a limited right\n27\n\nto privacy against “forced exposure to strangers of the opposite sex”.); Everson v. MDOC, 391\nF.3d 737, 757 n. 26 (6th Cir. 2004) (recognizing same).  Further, as the Sixth Circuit recently\nnoted, there is a “dignitary interest ‘inherent in the privacy component of the Fourth\nAmendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches.’”  Stoudemire v. MDOC, 705 F.3d\n560, 573 (6th Cir. 2013).  \nWhen a court evaluates whether a prison regulation infringes upon a prisoner’s\nconstitutional rights, “the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological\ninterests.”  Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 916-17 (emphasis in original) (quoting Turner v. Safely, 482\nU.S. 78, 89 (1987)); see also Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, --- U.S. ---, 132 S. Ct. 1510, 1515 (2012) (citing the same in regards to pretrial\ndetainees and explaining that this test “confirm[s] the importance of deference to correctional\nofficials” ).  In Bell v. Wolfish, the touchstone case regarding the constitutionality of strip\nsearches, the Supreme Court explained:\n[t]he test for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of\nprecise definition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing\nof the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in\nwhich it is conducted.  \n441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979) (upholding policy of suspicionless strip searches of pretrial detainees\nand convicted prisoners).  The job of evaluating whether a prison policy is reasonably related to\nlegitimate security interests “is ‘peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials.’ ... [and] ‘in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily\ndefer to their expert judgment in such matters.’”  Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1517 (internal citations\n28\n\nomitted).7  \nTherefore, as required by Bell and Florence, and reflected in the recent Sixth Circuit\ndecision of Stoudemire, this Court must balance the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of prisoners’ personal rights and to this end, “consider the scope of the particular\nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in\nwhich it is conducted.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559; Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516 (relying on same);\nsee also Williams v. City of Cleveland, 771 F.3d 945, 950 (6th Cir. 2014) (applying the same\nfactors in evaluating strip searches of pretrial detainees).  The Court views the facts in a light\nmost favorable to Plaintiffs. \n7 Both parties cite to the factors set forth in Cornwell, ostensibly from Turner, where the\nSupreme Court set forth certain enumerated factors to aid in determining whether the prison\npolicy is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest:\n \n(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the prison policy and the\nlegitimate governmental interest asserted to justify it; (2) the existence of\nalternative means for inmates to exercise their constitutional rights; (3) the impact\nthat accommodation of these constitutional rights may have on other guards and\ninmates, and on the allocation of prison resources; and (4) the absence of ready\nalternatives as evidence of the reasonableness of the regulation.\nCornwell, 963 F.2.d at 917 (citing Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 331 (9th Cir. 1988)\nand Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  However, the Supreme Court did not refer to these factors in\nFlorence, its most recent case addressing prison policies affecting Fourth Amendment privacy\nrights in the context of pretrial detainees, nor did the Sixth Circuit reference these factors in\nWilliams v. City of Cleveland that addressed the same.  Significantly, the Sixth Circuit did not\nreference these factors in its recent decision regarding a convicted prisoner’s Fourth Amendment\nconstitutional claims regarding strip searches in Stoudemire v. MDOC.  See Stoudemire, 705\nF.3d at 572 (quoting and applying the Bell “test of reasonableness” that a court “must consider\nthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the jurisdiction for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”).  Therefore, the Court does not rely upon\nthe Cornwell framework in its analysis but uses the more recent balancing of factors as first\nespoused by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, and explained in Florence, Stoudemire, and\nWilliams.   \n29\n\na.  Scope, Manner and Location\nPlaintiffs argue that the scope and manner of the chair portion of the strip search was\noverly invasive because such a search was a “body cavity search” that was performed in view of\nother inmates, by officers of the opposite gender and while they sat on a dirty chair.  Defendants,\non the other hand, argue that similar visual body cavity searches of prisoners in which there is no\nphysical touching by an inspecting official have been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme\nCourt.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 n. 39 (noting the search at issue involved the visual inspection\nof body cavities but there was no touching by any official); see also Florence, 132 S. Ct. at\n1515-17 (holding a policy that a visual body cavity search (and compelled delousing) of persons\ncharged with non-indictable offenses before their admission to the general population of the\nfacility did not offend the Fourth Amendment and describing the term “strip search” as\n“imprecise” and noting that in that particular case the term “does not include any touching of\nunclothed areas by the inspecting officer.  There are no allegations that the detainees here were\ntouched in any way as part of the searches.”); see also Goff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358, 364-65 (8th\nCir. 1986) (holding visual body cavity searches performed every time an inmate entered or left\nthe maximum security prison was reasonable).  \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ arguments improperly conflate the\nmeaning of a “body cavity search” and a visual “strip search”.  While the definition of a strip\nsearch or body cavity search can be imprecise, the MDOC policies define the terms with\nspecificity.  MDOC policy 04-04-110 provides that a “body cavity” search is one in which\nrequires reasonable suspicion that the prisoner is harboring contraband, “involves physical\nintrusion into a body cavity by the person conducting the search”, and requires the search to be\n30\n\nconducted by a licensed physician.  (Ex. C-1, PD 04-04-110 (eff. 4/24/09), at ¶¶ G(4), X).  While\na “strip search” is defined in the same policy as including a “visual inspection of the entrance to\nthe vagina and rectal cavity ...”.  (Id. at ¶ G(3)).  In the instant case, there are no allegations that\nthe officers physically touched the Plaintiffs, rather, the chair portion of the strip search was a\nvisual search of the Plaintiffs’ body cavities, consistent with the MDOC policy.  Therefore,\nPlaintiffs’ attempt to cast the chair portion of the strip search policy as a “body cavity search” is\nnot supported by the record or the MDOC policy itself.\nHowever, this does not end the Court’s inquiry.  Here, Defendants’ arguments that the\nchair portion of the strip search was reasonable because other courts have found that nonphysical\nstrip searches are constitutional disregard the real thrust of Plaintiffs’ claims - that the manner of\nthe strip searches as performed were unreasonable. \n In the present case, Plaintiffs’ allegations are factually distinct from those set forth in\nBell or Florence.  Here, the visual body cavity search at issue required that the prisoners sit on a\ndirty chair and manipulate their own vaginas at the direction of the officers and in full view of\nother prisoners.8  (Compl. ¶ 19(b)).  While true that there may be a valid penological reason to\njustify a visual body cavity search, the “manner in which the searches were conducted must itself\npass constitutional muster.”  Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 649 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding a\nplaintiff’s claim regarding strip searches that were allegedly conducted daily, at times in front of\nother prisoners, the guards did not change their latex gloves between searches should have gone\nto the jury); see also Hutchin v. McDaniel, 512 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he Fourth\n8 Plaintiffs argue in their Response brief that the searches were also done in fully view of \n“officers of the opposite sex.”  (Pls.’ Resp. at 4, 5, 10, 16, 17).  Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that\nthey were subject to derogatory remarks during the chair portion of the strip search.  (Pls.’ Resp.\nat 1).  However, Plaintiffs do not allege any of these particular facts in their Complaint. \n31\n\nAmendment protects prisoners from searches and seizures that go beyond legitimate penological\ninterests.  Searches of prisoners must be conducted in a manner that is reasonable under the facts\nand circumstances in which they are performed.”) (internal citation omitted)).  Indeed, the Sixth\nCircuit has explained that “if the search is conducted in a particularly invasive manner, despite\nthe lack of exigent circumstances that necessitate the degree of invasion to which the detainee is\nsubjected, then the search may be unreasonable by virtue of the way in which it is conducted.” \nWilliams, 771 F.3d at 952 (citing Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 574).  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs have alleged in their complaint that these strip searches took\nplace in the presence of other prisoners.  (Comp. at ¶ 19).  The Sixth Circuit has held that a\nvisual strip search is “an offense to the dignity of the individual” and is “undoubtedly\nhumiliating and deeply offensive to many”.  Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 572-73 (citations omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit has also recognized that where a strip search is preformed in the presence of\nothers, such a strip search is considered “more invasive” than one conducted in private.  Id. at\n953 (quoting Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 573 and collecting other cases).\nTherefore, given the facts in this limited record, the Court finds that the chair portion of\nthe strip search, if conducted in the presence of others, as alleged by Plaintiffs represents a\nsignificant incursion into the Plaintiffs’ privacy.  \nb. Justification \nThe Court now turns to the justification for the chair portion of the strip search.  Plaintiffs\nappear to concede that Defendants had a general legitimate penological interest for conducting a\nvisual strip search of prisoners after contact visits (see Pls.’ Resp. at 17, “[t]he assumption that\nprisoner searchers are initiated to detect and deter contraband cannot be ignored; indeed, MDOC\n32\n\nmay have a legitimate penological interest in searching, even strip searching, inmates after\ncontact visits.”).  Defendant Warren provides that routine strip searches on inmates after contact\nvisits is a “necessary tool” in the management of a prison and the goal of these strip searches is\nto prevent contraband items (i.e. weapons, drugs, money, jewelry, and cell phones) from being\nsmuggled into the prison.  (Warren Aff. at ¶ 5).  Further, Defendant Warren explained that the\nchair portion of the strip search was instituted because the MDOC was aware that female\nprisoners could hide contraband in their vaginas and because the MDOC, “at the time, believed\nthat incorporating a chair into the routine strip search procedure would aid staff in performing a\nmore thorough search for contraband and to better comply with MDOC policy on strip searches.” \n(Warren Aff. ¶ 8).  Moreover, Plaintiffs also do not argue in their brief that the chair portion of\nthe strip search was unconstitutional merely because the policy did not require particularized or\nindividualized suspicion.  (See Pls.’ Resp. at 16).  Plaintiffs’ tacit concession of these issues is\nsupported by the fact that “[u]nquestionably, ‘detect[ing] and deter[ing] the possession of\ncontraband’ is a legitimate penological objective.”  Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 573 (quoting\nFlorence, 134 S. Ct. at 1517).\nAs the Sixth Circuit has recently instructed, however, “the pertinent question” is whether\nthe Defendants’ “selection of the particular procedures to which it subjected plaintiffs is\nreasonably related to that legitimate end”.  Williams, 771 F.3d at 954 (citation omitted).  In the\npresent action, Plaintiffs claim that the chair portion of the strip search was overly invasive and\nan exaggerated response to “considerations of institutional security”.  (Pls.’ Resp. at 17). \nIn Williams the Sixth Circuit found that “a correctional institution will have little need to\nconduct the search or seizure in a particular manner if there are “obvious, easy alternatives ...\n33\n\nthat fully accommodate[] the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost’ to the institution’s valid\npenological interest underlying the search in the first place.”  Williams, 771 F.3d at 954 (quoting\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90-91).  In the present action, Plaintiffs argue that the chair portion of the\nstrip search an exaggerated response to any security issue because the prisoners were already\nmade to bend over, spread their buttocks and cough during a routine strip search.  Morever,\nPlaintiffs note that the cough and bend portion of the strip search is an example of an alternative,\nless invasive means by which the goals of the strip search could be accomplished.  It is\nundisputed that the cough and bend procedure was used prior to 2009 when the inmates were not\nsubject to the chair portion of the search, is used currently, and was also used in addition to the\nchallenged chair portion of the strip search during 2009 and 2011.  \nThe Court further notes that the December 2011 Memo provides that during the time\nperiod the chair portion of the strip search was officially authorized only one piece of contraband\nwas discovered, and that contraband was found pursuant to the bend procedure - not the chair\nportion of the search.  (See 12/14/11 Memo, at 10).  Finally, Defendants’ December 2011\nMemorandum notes that pursuant to its own survey of guards who performed the search, 75% of\nthe guards surveyed did not believe it was necessary, and 100% of the guards surveyed believed\nthey could conduct the strip search effectively without the chair portion of the search.  (Id. at 10). \nc. Weighing the Factors\nA regulation that infringes upon a prisoner’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1515 (citation\nomitted).  Here, Plaintiffs have asserted that the chair portion of the strip search was carried out\nin an unreasonable manner because prisoners were made or are still made to sit on dirty chairs, in\n34\n\nfull view of other prisoners, directed to manipulate their own vaginas and such a search was\nneedless and gratuitous because the strip search already involved a bend and cough procedure\nthat accomplished the same goals and was just as effective.  Defendants argue simply that they\nhave a strong interest in ensuring dangerous contraband is kept out of their prisons and rely upon\nthe well settled precept that a court should generally defer to the needs of prison administration. \nSee Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.  However, the Sixth Circuit has recently reaffirmed that “we must not\nconfuse deference with abdication.”  Williams, 771 F.3d at 951 (quoting Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at\n572)).  \nGiven these facts and weighing the Bell factors, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have raised\na genuine issue of material fact at this stage regarding whether the chair portion of the strip\nsearch was conducted in a reasonable manner.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ allegations raise a genuine\nissue of material fact regarding whether the chair portion of the strip search as conducted on\nthese particular persons was reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and where it\nmay have been gratuitous or duplicative of measures already in use. \nC. Clearly Established Law\n“Once a court finds a constitutional violation, it must next consider whether ‘the right\nwas clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.’” Goodwin v. City of Painesville, 781\nF.3d 314, 324 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Campbell v. City of Springboro, 700 F.3d 779, 786 (6th\nCir. 2012)).  A constitutional right is clearly established if “[t]he contours of that right [are]\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violated that\nright.”  Wheeler v. City of Lansing, 660 F.3d 931, 938 (6th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \n35\n\nDefendants briefly argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the\nPlaintiffs cannot cite to case in which a court established that a strip search performed by an\nofficer of the same sex “employing the use of a chair for a portion of the strip search” was\nunconstitutional.  (Defs.’ Br. at 16).  The Court rejects Defendants’ argument as construing the\nconstitutional right at issue too narrowly.  Indeed, in determining whether a clearly established\nright exists, “there need not be a case with the exact same fact pattern or even ‘fundamentally\nsimilar’ or ‘materially similar’ facts; rather, the question is whether the defendants had ‘fair\nwarning’ that their actions were unconstitutional.’” Goodwin, 781 F.3d at 324 (quoting\nCummings v. City of Akron, 418 F.3d 676, 687 (6th Cir. 2005)).  \nTellingly, in Stoudemire, the Sixth Circuit rejected a similar attempt to narrowly construe\nthe contours of a ‘clearly established right’ where the defendant official argued that a prisoner\nhad no right to be free from a same-sex strip search under the Fourth Amendment.  Stoudemire,\n705 F.3d at 574-75.  In Stoudemire, the Sixth Circuit noted that “it was clearly established that\nsuspicionless strip searches were permissible as a matter of constitutional law, only so long as\nthey were reasonable under the circumstances and performed pursuant to a legitimate\npenological justification.”  Id. at 575.  The Sixth Circuit concluded that the right implicated was\nthe “well established right, the right not to be subjected to a humiliating strip search in full view\nof several (or perhaps many) others unless the procedure is reasonably related to a legitimate\npenological interest.”  Id.  \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs have identified a similar well established right to be free\nfrom a strip search that was performed in full view of other prisoners.  See Id.  Viewing the facts\nin a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that such a right was well-established in\n36\n\n2009, where earlier case law clearly instructs that a strip search must be reasonably related to a\nlegitimate penological purpose and that the manner of that search also be reasonable.  See Bell,\n441 U.S. at 559-60.  Here, the Court finds that a reasonable officer would have known that a\nstrip search performed in front of other prisoners was not related to a legitimate penological\ninterest. The Sixth Circuit held in Williams that it has been a “long-standing rule” that a strip\nsearch “even if it does not need to be based upon individualized suspicion, still ‘must be\nconducted in a reasonable manner.’” Williams, 771 F.3d at 951 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 560));\nsee also Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 917. \nAs the Court has already found that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether\nthe chair portion of the strip search was conducted in a reasonable manner or reasonably related\nto a legitimate penological purpose, the Court must deny Defendant Warren qualified immunity. \nC. Possible Prospective Relief regarding the Chair Portion of the Strip Search \nPlaintiffs assert in their Response that they seek prospective injunctive relief against the\nMDOC (and the individual Defendants in their official capacity), and request that the MDOC\ncease the practice of the chair portion of the strip search.  (Pls.’ Resp. at 12).  \nDefendants respond that the routine practice of the chair portion of the strip search was\nexplicitly abandoned as of December 2011 and therefore argue that any request for prospective\ninjunctive relief regarding the policy is moot.  However, Plaintiffs argue that they have been\nsubjected to the chair portion of the strip search after the policy change and that the practice is\nstill currently being used at WHV.  (Compl. ¶ 30).  Plaintiffs also supply the Court with\naffidavits from the Plaintiffs which state that each Plaintiff suffered the search at issue after the\ndate Warren abolished the “routine” practice.  Plaintiffs further claim that 500 grievances have\n37\n\nbeen filed objecting to the search practice and some (it is unclear how many) were filed after the\nchair portion of the strip search was allegedly abolished as a “routine” practice.  (Pls.’ Br. Ex. 4,\nAppendix).  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the Court must at this\nstage in the litigation, Plaintiffs’ allegations of on-going strip searches which involve the use of a\nchair allow the Court to conclude that these searches are on-going and that the possibility of\nprospective relief remains viable. \nTherefore, the Court rejects Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ request for prospective\ninjunctive relief is moot and denies summary judgment in this regard.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss and for Summary Judgment based on Qualified Immunity (ECF No. 11).  Therefore, the\nCourt:\n(1)  GRANTS Defendants’ Motion and DISMISSES the Eighth Amendment claims\nagainst Defendants Warren, Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher in their\nindividual capacity based on qualified immunity; \n(2) GRANTS Defendants’ Motion and DISMISSES Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth\nAmendment Due Process claims against ALL Defendants; \n(3) GRANTS Defendants’ Motion and DISMISSES the Fourth Amendment claims\nagainst Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher in their individual\ncapacities based on qualified immunity;\n(4) DENIES qualified immunity to Defendant Warren in her individual capacity on \nthese individual Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims; and\n(4)  DENIES Defendants’ Motion to the extent they argue these individual Plaintiffs’\nclaims for prospective relief are moot. \ns/Paul D.

Named Plaintiffs Amira Salem \nand Keshuna Abcumby, both former inmates there, filed suit against the Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections, Warden Millicent Warren, and four other state officials, \nalleging that the  inmate  strip  search procedures used  by officers  at the  facility \nviolated their rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. \nIn  May  20 15,  this  Court  dismissed  Plaintiffs'  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment  claims  against  all  Defendants,  and  Plaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment \nclaims against all Defendants except Defendant Warren, concluding that Defendant \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3433    Page 2 of 45\nWarren  was  not  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  on  that  claim.  The  1ssue  of \nprospective injunctive relief against MDOC was not raised in this count. \nDefendants  appealed  this  Court's  ruling  denying  qualified  immunity  to \nDefendant Warren to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which \naffirmed that ruling. See generally Salem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., 643 F. App'x \n526 (6th Cir. 2016) (available on the docket at ECF No. 32). The Sixth Circuit noted \nthat Defendant Warren had not raised at the District Court the issue that there were \nno facts supporting her personal involvement in any searches done in public view \nand that MDOC policy forbade guards from searching in such a manner. See id. at \n530.  In December 2016, this  Court denied Plaintiffs'  class  certification motion \nwithout prejudice. \nThe remaining issues are whether Defendant Warren is entitled to summary \njudgment on the claim that strip searches were performed in view of others, and \nwhether Plaintiffs are entitled to future injunctive relief against MDOC. \nPresently before the Court are Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \nand  Qualified  Immunity,  as  well  as  Plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment. \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3434    Page 3 of 45\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \n1.  Chair-based Strip Searches at the Women's Huron Valley \nCorrectional Facility \nPrior to 2009, a standard strip search at a correctional facility that housed \nfemale prisoners in Michigan was conducted by female corrections officers, who \nwould require the prisoner to \"remove her clothing [and] bend forward, [to allow] \nfor a visual inspection of the entrance to the vagina and rectal cavity; in such cases, \nthe [prisoner would] be required to bend and spread her buttocks, and cough.\" (ECF \nNo. 21, May 20 15 Opinion and Order1 at 3, Pg ID 241  (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (citing ECF No. 11  Ex. A, January 2014 Affidavit of Millicent Warren~ \n6).) \"The female [corrections officer] then performed a visual check of the inmate's \nmouth, nose, ears, hair and asked the prisoner to allow the officer clear view of areas \nbehind ears and under breasts.\" (/d. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).) \nDefendant  Millicent  Warren  became  warden  of MDOC's  Huron  Valley \ncomplex in October 2008. (ECF No. 65, Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A, Deposition of \n1 The factual summary in this section is drawn in part from this Court's May 1, 2015 \nOpinion and Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' Motion to \nDismiss and for Summary Judgment Based on Qualified Immunity. See generally \nSalem v.  Michigan Dep't ofCorr., No.  13-14567, 2015 WL 1966727 (E.D. Mich. \nMay 1, 2015) (available on the docket at ECF No. 21). There is no apparent dispute \nas to the facts set forth herein that are drawn from the May 2015 Opinion and Order. \n3 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3435    Page 4 of 45\nMillicent Warren at 39:25-40:2.) At some time prior to that, MDOC had instituted \nthe use of a chair to aid corrections officers in performing strip searches on female \ninmates, in certain circumstances, in the East Side of the facility. (May 20 15 Opinion \nand  Order at  3-4,  Pg  ID  241-42.)  After MDOC  consolidated  all  of its  female \nprisoners into the Huron Valley facility-now known as the Women's Huron Valley \nCorrectional Facility (\"WHV\")-in 2009, id., MDOC also implemented the chair-\nbased strip searches on the West Side of the facility. (ECF No.  18 Ex. A, March \n2014 Supplemental Affidavit of Millicent Warren~ 4.) \nAs  to  the  specifics  of the  chair-based  strip  searches,  a  WHV  Operating \nProcedure  dated  May  1,  2009  (and  hereinafter  referred  to  as  \"WHV-OP-\n04.04.110\"2 defined the general term \"strip search\" as follows: \n) \n2 WHV-OP-04.04.110, an Operating Procedure specific to WHV, implemented the \nmore  general  MDOC  Policy Directive  04.04.110  (hereinafter \"PD  04.04.110\"), \nentitled  \"Search  and  Arrest  in  Correctional  Facilities.\"  Warren  clarified  the \ndifference between Policy Directives and Operating Procedures in her September \n21, 2017 deposition, explaining that Policy Directives represent MDOC's \"position \non ... any particular topic,\" while an Operating Procedure \"tells you how to do that, \nhow do you accomplish that goal.\" (Warren Dep. 11 :8-15.) The record suggests that \ndifferent versions ofPD 04.04.110 have been in effect at different times, but there is \nno  apparent  dispute  that  PD  04.04.110  and  WHV -OP-04.04.11 0  represent  the \nrelevant formal policy documents in this case. \nWarren  further testified  in  her  deposition  that  within the  grievance  procedures \navailable  to  WHV  inmates  at the  relevant  time,  inmates  could  file  grievances \nconcerning formal MDOC or WHV policies like those discussed above, but that such \ngrievances were necessarily denied because inmates \"cannot grieve policy.\" (Warren \nDep. 8:5-22.) On the other hand, inmates could grieve implementation of policy \ni.e., not following it-as Warren testified: \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3436    Page 5 of 45\nStrip Search: Visual inspection of all body surfaces of a person who has \nbeen required to remove all or most of his/her clothing and jewelry for \npurposes of the search. This includes visual inspection of the mouth, \nears,  and  nasal  cavities.  Unless  determined  by  the  Warden  to  be \nunnecessary  for  an assignment within the  security perimeter which \nrequires a strip search (e.g., Michigan State Industries), it also includes \nvisual inspection of the entrance to the vagina and rectal cavity; in such \ncases, the person will be required to bend and spread her buttocks and \nsit on a sanitary paper lined chair and spread her knees so as to spread \nthe lips of her vagina to  allow inspection. All  clothing and articles \nwhich are removed also shall be inspected for contraband. \n(ECF No. 11  Ex. A, Jan. 2014 Warren Aff. Ex. C-2, WHV-OP-04.04.110 at 3, Pg \nID 129 (emphasis in original).) Importantly, WHV-OP-04.04.110 also provides that \nQ. ... I  think you testified  earlier that prisoners  can't grieve a  policy  itself, \nmeaning they can't file a grievance to say, \"Hey, I don't like strip searches. I think \nthey violate my rights. I'm filing this grievance.\" That would be rejected under \nthat MDOC policy? \nA. That's correct. \nQ. Okay. But if a prisoner had a problem with the way a policy was implemented \nand believed it went outside the scope of it, that's grievable, isn't it? \nA. Yes, it is. \nQ. Okay. So if an officer stepped outside the bounds of what they're supposed to \ndo, they could grieve it; correct? \nA. That's correct. \nQ. So if an officer were performing a strip search and left the door open and could \nsee a bunch of people out in the hallway, even though he did everything right \nwith the chair strip . . . search in every other fashion except that, the prisoner \nwould have a right to grieve that, wouldn't they? \nA. That's correct. \n(Warren Dep. 50:14-51 :9.) \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3437    Page 6 of 45\n\"[a] strip search of a prisoner at WHV must be conducted by and only in the presence \nof female employees.\" (!d. at 4, Pg ID 130.) \nThese types of searches were performed after a prisoner returned from an off \nsite visit (including hospital visits or leaving the prison on writ), and after each \n\"contact visit\" (i.e., visits in which a prisoner was allowed physical contact with her \nvisitors). (May 2015 Opinion and Order at 4, Pg ID 242.) Warren averred in a sworn \naffidavit that the decision to use the chair portion of the strip search was an attempt \n\"to better comply with the search depicted in the 1998 training video which showed \nhow a proper strip search of female offenders was to be done. The additional step of \nusing a chair was added because of the awareness that females could hide contraband \nin their vagina.\" (!d.  (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Jan. 2014 Warren \nAff.  ~ 8).)  Warren  further  averred  that  \"MDOC,  at  the  time,  believed  that \nincorporating  a chair into the  routine  strip  search procedure would aid  staff in \nperforming a more thorough search for contraband and to better comply with MDOC \npolicy on strip searches.\" (!d.  at 4-5, Pg ID 242-43) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).) \nThe 1998 training video includes a visual depiction of how to conduct a strip \nsearch pursuant to PD 04.04.110, and instructs that during a routine strip search the \nfemale inmate is \"required to sit and spread the lips of her vagina.\" (!d. at 5, Pg ID \n243 (citing Jan. 2014 Warren Aff. Ex. B, Video).) The training video further advises \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3438    Page 7 of 45\nthat any tampon or sanitary napkin must be removed to allow the corrections officer \nto visually search the vaginal opening, but is silent as to the maintenance of sanitary \nconditions and as to the prevention of the spread of communicable disease. (!d. \n(citing Jan. 2014 Warren Aff. Ex. B, Video).) \nWarren testified that the initial decision to institute the chair portion of the \nstrip search in the Huron Valley complex was not hers, as it was being used on the \nEast Side of the  facility  before she became warden.  (Warren Dep.  40:18-41:6.) \nWarren also testified as to how searches like this were to be carried out: specifically, \nshe testified that they were required to be conducted in a windowless room by female \nofficers, and that only the officer performing the search was allowed to be present \nin the room with the inmate unless another officer was also present for training \npurposes. (Warren Dep. 49: 12-25.) Like all strip search procedures, strip searches \ninvolving a chair were to be conducted one at a time, out of view of other prisoners. \n(Warren Dep. 50:1-13.) \nWarren provided  further  testimony regarding the  administration of chair \nbased strip searches in a sworn affidavit dated December 14, 2017. (Defs.' Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. B, December 2017 Affidavit of Millicent Warren, Pg ID 706-10.) In \nthat affidavit, she averred, consistently with the language of WHY- OP-04.04.11 0 \nquoted above, that the policy required any strip search to be conducted \"by and only \nin the presence of female employees.\" (Dec. 2017 Warren Aff. ~ 3 (quoting WHY-\n7 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3439    Page 8 of 45\nOP-04.04.110 at 4, Pg ID 130).) She then averred as follows: \nAt no time did I give instruction to staff to violate these policies in any \nway. I did not encourage staff to conduct strip searches of prisoners in \nview of other prisoners or to conduct strip searches in an unsanitary \nmanner. I did not participate directly in conducting strip searches of \nprisoners in view of other prisoners or to conduct strip searches in an \nunsanitary manner. I did not implicitly authorize, approve or knowingly \nacquiesce in staff conducting strip searches of prisoners in view of other \nprisoners or to conduct strip searches in an unsanitary manner. \n(!d.) \n2.  Inmate Complaints and Subsequent Policy Changes \nDuring 2010 and 2011, MDOC personnel (including Warren) became aware \nof complaints from inmates at WHV regarding the chair strip search. (May 2015 \nOpinion and Order at 6, Pg ID 244.) The parties differ over the precise number of \nsuch complaints, but there is no dispute that MDOC received at least 67 grievances \nregarding some aspect of the chair strip search between 2009 and 2011, and that \nWHV's psychological services staff received at least 30 complaints regarding the \nsame (with possible overlap between the two groups). (See id. at 6-7, Pg ID 244-45.) \nComplaints about WHV's strip search procedures were also raised by WHV \ninmates  at  Warden's  Forum  Committee  (\"WFC\")  meetings,  which  Warren \nconducted periodically in order to share news with the inmate population and to \nallow inmates to  discuss  issues  of concern to them.  (Warren Dep.  12:20-13:6.) \nMinute records from  four WFC meetings (three in 2009 and one in early 2011) \n8 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3440    Page 9 of 45\nreflect  that  WHV  inmates  raised  vanous  complaints  about  the  strip  search \nprocedures at those meetings, including, inter alia, complaints that the procedures \nwere unhygienic, required some inmates to violate their own religious practices, and \ncould be traumatic to prisoners with histories of sexual abuse. (Warren Dep. Exs. 8-\n11, Pg ID 882-900.) \nIn  response  to  these  gnevances  and  complaints,  Warren  began  an \nadministrative fact finding and review process to evaluate the necessity of the chair \nstrip  search.  (ld.)  Ultimately,  on June  3,  2011,  Warren  issued  a  memorandum \namending the relevant language in WHV -OP-04.04.11 0. The newly amended WHV-\nOP-04.04.11 0 contained the same definition of \"Strip Search\" as quoted above, but \nadded the following language directly after that definition: \nNOTE: If necessary, the prisoner may be required to manually spread \nthe lips of her vagina with her hands. If this procedure is necessary, the \nprisoner will be allowed to sanitize their hands before and after this \nprocedure with an approve[ d] sanitizer. \n(May 2015 Opinion and Order at 7-8, Pg ID 245-56 (quoting ECF No.  11  Ex. B, \nJune  2011  Memorandum  at  Pg  ID  154).)  Warren  stated  in  the  June  3,  2011 \nmemorandum that \"[t]here is now an approved sanitizer located in each strip search \nroom and [it] shall be available whenever a strip search needs to be performed and \nthe prisoner is required to 'manually spread the lips of her vagina with her hands'.\" \n(!d. (quoting June 2011 Memorandum at Pg ID 154).) \n9 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3441    Page 10 of 45\nOn December  14,  2011,  Warren issued a second memorandum regarding \nWHV search procedures, specifically addressing the issue of whether the \"chair \nportion of the regular post contact visit strip search [should] be continued as a matter \nof routine.\"  (/d.  at 8-9,  Pg  ID  246-47  (quoting Jan.  2014  Warren  Af£  Ex.  A, \nDecember  2011  Memorandum  at  1,  Pg  ID  99).)  In  the  December  14,  2011 \nmemorandum, Warren recounted the history of the chair portion of the strip search, \nstating that the chair portion of the strip search was \"instituted in an effort to operate \nthe facility in complete accord with MDOC policy\" and referring to the 1998 training \nvideo. (/d.  at 9, Pg ID 247 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting December \n2011  Memorandum  at  1-2,  Pg  ID  99-100).)  Warren  also  explained  in  the \nmemorandum that the  \"MDOC  Central  Office,  after discussion  with the  WHV \nwarden, decided the use of the chair and visual inspection of the vaginal opening \nwas an important part of the strip search of female prisoners after contact visits.\" (/d. \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting December 2011 Memorandum at 2, Pg \nID 10 0).) The memorandum then addressed six factors that Warren considered in \ndetermining whether to continue the chair portion of the routine strip search: ( 1) the \nresults of random drug tests administered in 2010 and 2011; (2) comments from the \nfacility's mental health staff; (3) prisoner grievances concerning the chair portion of \nthe strip search; (4  ) the extent to which prisoners had availed themselves of a \"non \ncontact visit\" option to avoid having to undergo the chair portion of the strip search; \n10 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3442    Page 11 of 45\n(5) the results of a survey administered to corrections officers who had performed \nthe chair portion of the strip search; and ( 6) the number of instances in which a strip \nsearch had revealed contraband hidden on an inmate's person since the chair portion \nof the  strip  search was  implemented.  (See  id  at 9-11,  Pg  ID  247-49.)  Warren \nsummarized her conclusion as follows: \n[o   ]n balance the increased security benefit provided by the use of the \nchair portion  of the  strip  search,  on  the  present  data may  not  be \nsufficiently great to require, even though it allows, the modest stressor \nof continued use of the chair portion of the routine post contact visit \nstrip search .... the chair portion of the strip search appears viewed by \nboth  prisoners  and  the  staff conducting  the  strip  searches  as  an \nunnecessary irritation. Therefore, I have decided to suspend the routine \nuse of the chair portion of the  strip  search following  contact visits \neffective Friday, December 16, 20 11. \n(!d.  at  11-12,  Pg  ID  249-50  (alteration  1n  original)  (quoting  December  2011 \nMemorandum at 14-15, Pg ID 112-13).) \nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs filed this putative class action on November 1, 2013, seeking relief \nfor conduct at WHV \"during the last three years.\" (ECF No. 1, Compl. ~ 1.) Plaintiffs \nasserted  two  substantive  claims  in  their  Complaint:  violation  of the  Eighth \nAmendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment (Count 1), and violation \nof Plaintiffs'  privacy  and  due  process  rights  under the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments (Count II). Plaintiffs brought the action against Warren, MDOC, and \nfour other MDOC employees (sued, like Warren, in both their official and individual \n11 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3443    Page 12 of 45\ncapacities)  whom  Plaintiffs  alleged  were  in  some  way  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the chair portion of the strip search. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs \nrequested certification of the lawsuit as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23, as well as various forms of injunctive, declaratory, and other \nlegal relief. (See Compl. at 14, Pg ID 14.) \n1.  Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment \nOn January 21,2014, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and for Summary \nJudgment Based upon Qualified Immunity. (ECF No. 11.) Plaintiffs filed a Response \non March 11, 2014 (ECF No. 17), and Defendants filed a Reply on March 25, 2014 \n(ECF No. 18). The Court conducted a hearing on Defendants' Motion on June 26, \n2014. \nOn May 1, 2015, the Court entered an Opinion and Order Granting in Part and \nDenying in Part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment Based \nupon Qualified Immunity. See generally Salem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., No. 13-\n14567,2015 WL 1966727 (E.D. Mich. May 1, 2015) (available on the docket at ECF \nNo. 21 ). This Court first noted that both parties relied on evidence outside of the \npleadings in their briefs, and thus made clear that \"to the extent that this Court relies \nupon  Defendants'  and  Plaintiffs'  proffered  evidence,  the  Court  construes \nDefendants' motion as one for summary judgment under FED. R. CIV. P.  56(a).\" \n(May 2015 Opinion and Order at 14, Pg ID 252.) \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3444    Page 13 of 45\nTurning to the merits, the Court first held that \"Plaintiffs' claims insofar as \nthey seek money damages against the :MDOC or against the individual defendants \nsued in their official capacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\" (Id. at 15, Pg \nID  253.)  The  Court then  addressed the  merits  of the  constitutional  claims  that \nPlaintiffs had asserted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. First, the Court found that Plaintiffs \nhad \"failed to differentiate any possible Fourteenth Amendment due process claim \nfrom  their  Fourth  or  Eighth  Amendment  claim\"  either  in  their  Response  to \nDefendants' Motion or at oral argument, and had therefore \"abandoned any due \nprocess claim pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment arising under the facts alleged \nin this action.\" (May 2015 Opinion and Order at 18, Pg ID 256 (citing Brown v.  VHS \nof Mich.,  Inc.,  545  F.  App'x 368, 372 (6th Cir. 2013)).) As to Plaintiffs' Eighth \nAmendment  claim,  the  Court held  that  the  four  individual  Defendants  besides \nWarren were entitled to qualified immunity because Plaintiffs had failed to plead or \nargue  any  specific  personal  involvement  by  those  Defendants  in  the  search \nprocedures  at  issue.  The  Court then  found  that  Warren  herself was  entitled to \nqualified immunity  because Plaintiffs could not show that she  had violated the \nEighth Amendment in light of Warren's \"knowledge of prisoner's complaints, her \ninquiry [into] the matter, her actions to make the search sanitary, and her direction \nthat prisoners could choose to avoid the chair portion of the search by foregoing \ncontact visits, and her formal abandonment of the policy.\" (Id. at 25, Pg ID 263.) \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3445    Page 14 of 45\nAs  to Plaintiffs'  Fourth Amendment claims,  the  Court held that the  four \nindividual Defendants besides Warren were  entitled to  qualified immunity as to \nthose claims for the same reason that they had qualified immunity as to Plaintiffs' \nEighth  Amendment  claims:  Plaintiffs'  \"fail[u re]  to  differentiate  the  individual \nconduct of [those] Defendants.\" (/d.  at 27, Pg ID 265 (citing Roth v.  Guzman, 650 \nF.3d 603, 609 (6th Cir. 2007)).) \nBy contrast, Defendant Warren was denied qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' \nFourth Amendment claims. This Court first explained that the appropriate inquiry \nwas to \"balance the need for the particular search against the invasion of prisoners' \npersonal rights and to this end, 'consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted.\"' (/d. at 29, Pg ID 267 (quoting Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n559 (1979)).) As to the invasiveness of the search, the Court cited Sixth Circuit case \nlaw  holding that  strip  searches  conducted  in  the  presence  of others  are  \"more \ninvasive\" than those conducted in private (see id. at 32, Pg ID 270 (quoting Williams \nv.  City of Cleveland, 771 F.3d 945, 953 (6th Cir. 2014)), and therefore found \"that \nthe chair portion of the strip search, if conducted in the presence ofo thers, as alleged \nby  Plaintiffs represents  a  significant incursion  into  the  Plaintiffs'  privacy.\"  (/d. \n(emphasis added).) Then, the Court determined that notwithstanding Defendants' \n\"general  legitimate  penological  interest  for  conducting  a  visual  strip  search  of \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3446    Page 15 of 45\nprisoners after contact visits,\" there was little evidence that the chair portion of the \nstrip search procedure specifically furthered that interest in ways that standard strip \nsearches did not.  (Id  at 32-34, Pg ID 270-72.) Accordingly, the Court held that \nPlaintiffs' allegations raised \"a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the \nchair portion  of the  strip  search  as  conducted  on  these  particular persons  was \nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and where it may have been \ngratuitous or duplicative of measures already in use.\" (!d.  at 35, Pg ID 273.) \nThe Court then rounded out the qualified immunity inquiry by addressing the \nissue of whether the constitutional right that was allegedly violated \"was 'clearly \nestablished' at the time of the challenged conduct.\"' (!d.  at 26, Pg ID 264 (quoting \nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011)).) In that regard, the Court found that \nbecause pre-2009 case law \"clearly instructs that a strip search must be reasonably \nrelated to a legitimate penological purpose and that the manner of that search also \nbe  reasonable[,] ... a  reasonable  officer would  have  known that  a  strip  search \nperformed in front of other prisoners was not related to a legitimate penological \ninterest.\" (!d.  at 37, Pg ID 275 (internal citations omitted) (collecting authorities).) \nThe Court therefore denied qualified immunity to Defendant Warren. \nFinally, the  Court took up  Defendants'  argument that the injunctive relief \nPlaintiffs sought-specifically, their \"request that the MDOC cease the practice of \nthe chair portion of the strip search\"-was moot because the chair portion of the \n15 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3447    Page 16 of 45\nstrip search was formally discontinued as a \"routine practice\" in December 20 11. \n(!d. at 37-38, Pg ID 275-76.) The Court rejected this argument, since Plaintiffs had \nalleged (and averred in sworn affidavits) that they and other inmates at WHV had \n\"suffered the search at issue after the date Warren abolished the 'routine' practice.\" \n(!d.) The Court thus concluded that \"Plaintiffs' allegations of on-going strip searches \nwhich involve the use of a chair allow the Court to conclude that these searches are \non-going and that the possibility of prospective relief remains viable.\" (!d.) \n2.  Defendants' Appeal to the Sixth Circuit \nBoth parties collaterally appealed the Court's May 1, 2015 Opinion and Order. \n(ECF  Nos.  23,  26.)  The  Sixth  Circuit  dismissed  Plaintiffs'  appeal  for  lack  of \njurisdiction on September 8, 2015. (ECF No. 31.) \nApproximately six months later, on March 9, 2016, the Sixth Circuit issued \nan opinion regarding Defendants' appeal, affirming this Court's denial of qualified \nimmunity to Defendant Warren, and dismissing for lack of jurisdiction Defendants' \nappeal of this Court's determination that Plaintiffs' injunctive-relief claim was not \nmoot. See generally Salem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., 643 F. App'x 526 (6th Cir. \n2016) (available on the docket at ECF No. 32). On the qualified immunity issue, the \ncourt rejected Plaintiffs' argument that the lack of individualized suspicion rendered \nthe  challenged  searches  unconstitutional,  holding  that  such  an  argument  was \nforeclosed by both Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precedent. (See id. at 4 (citing \n16 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3448    Page 17 of 45\nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders ofCty. ofB  urlington, 566 U.S. 318, 330-34 \n(2012) and Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep't ofCorr., 705 F.3d 560, 575 (6th Cir. 2013)).) \nThe Sixth Circuit then turned to Warren's argument that the manner in which \nthe  challenged  searches  were  conducted  was  constitutionally  permissible.  In \naddition, Warren argued that Plaintiffs had failed to show her personal involvement \nin any searches performed in public view, and that MDOC policy in fact forbade \nguards  from  conducting searches  in  this  way,  but the  Sixth Circuit declined to \naddress this argument because it had not been raised before this Court in the first \ninstance. \nThe  Sixth  Circuit  thus  confined  its  inquiry  \"to  whether  the  searches, \nperformed in the  manner alleged by Plaintiffs, violated their clearly established \nFourth Amendment rights.\" (!d.  at 5.) To that issue, the Sixth Circuit applied the \nsame balancing test that this Court had employed in the May 2015  Opinion and \nOrder: \nWhether  a  prison  search  is  constitutionally  reasonable  depends  on \n\"whether the  jail's  'need  for  the  particular  search'  outweighs  'the \ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.'\" Williams, 771 F.3d \nat 950 (quoting Bell v.  Wolfish, 441  U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 \nL.Ed.2d 447  (1979);  Stoudemire,  705  F.3d at  572).  In making this \ndetermination, we \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and \nthe place in which it is conducted,\" id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, \n99 S.Ct. 1861 ), while also examining \"obvious, easy alternatives\" that \naccommodate  the  inmate's  privacy  interests  at  little  cost  to  valid \n17 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3449    Page 18 of 45\npenological objectives, id. (quoting Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 90-\n91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). \nSalem, 643 F. App'x at 530.  The Sixth Circuit rejected Warren's contention that \nWilliams and Stoudemire were distinguishable on their facts, finding that the factual \ndifferences between those two decisions and this case ultimately \nfail to undercut this court's stance that searches conducted in view of \nother inmates-who \"do not share the searching officers' institutional \nneed to view [another prisoner] unclothed\"-are exceedingly intrusive. \nWilliams,  771  F.3d  at  953.  Moreover,  Plaintiffs  pair  their  public \nviewing allegations with claims that guards forced the inmates to \"sit \nnaked on an unwashed and unsanitized chair wet with bodily fluids \nfrom  other prisoners.\"  These  aspects  of the  searches  amplify  their \n.  . \nInvasiveness. \n!d. \nAs to the justification for the challenged search procedures, the Sixth Circuit \nacknowledged the importance of MDOC's need to detect and deter the possession \nof contraband among its inmates, but concluded that those goals \"can be met through \nconstitutionally competent searches outside the view of other inmates.\" (!d.  at 6 \n(citing Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 574).) Indeed, the court noted, \"the obvious, less \ninvasive alternative is to 'conduct the searches and seizures in private rather than in \nthe presence of other [prisoners].\"' (!d.  (quoting Williams, 771  F.3d at 955).) As \nWarren had made no argument \"that this alternative would undermine penological \nobjectives,\"  the  Sixth  Circuit upheld  this  Court's judgment \"denying  qualified \nimmunity to Warren regarding the non-private searches.\" (!d.) Further, the court held \n18 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3450    Page 19 of 45\nthat under its own precedents, '\"the right not to be subjected to a humiliating strip \nsearch in full view of several (or perhaps many) others' was clearly established by \nFebruary 2007-two years before Warren implemented the chair searches at issue.\" \n(!d. at 7 (quoting Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 575).) \nFinally, the Sixth Circuit held that it had no jurisdiction over Defendants' \nappeal of this Court's decision to allow Plaintiffs'  claim for injunctive relief to \nproceed. In that regard, the court explained that while the collateral-order doctrine \npermits  interlocutory  appeals  of district-court  denials  of Eleventh  Amendment \nimmunity, Defendants never raised that issue before this Court in the first instance, \nand so \"no 'district court order denying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity' \nexist[ed] for Defendants to collaterally appeal.\" (/d.  at 7 (quoting P.R. Aqueduct & \nSewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993).) \n3.  Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class \nAfter the matter was remanded and the parties had conducted discovery for \nseveral months, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification on August 11, 2016. \n(ECF No. 44.) The parties briefed the Motion in full (ECF Nos. 50-51), and this \nCourt held a hearing on the Motion on November 16, 2016. On December 22, 2016, \nthe Court denied Plaintiffs' class certification motion without prejudice. (ECF No. \n56, December 2016 Opinion and Order.) The issue of class certification is not dealt \nwith in this Opinion. \n19 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3451    Page 20 of 45\n4.  Instant Motions \nIn Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Qualified Immunity (ECF \nNo.  65, Defs.' Mot.  Summ. J.), remaining Defendants Warren and MDOC seek \nsummary judgment in two respects: for Warren in her individual capacity based on \nqualified immunity, and for MDOC itself (as well as for Warren in her official \ncapacity, which amounts to the same thing) with regard to Plaintiffs' request for \nprospective  injunctive  relief.  Plaintiffs  filed  a  timely  Response  to  Defendants' \nMotion. (ECF No. 67, Pls.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J.) Defendants did not file a Reply. \nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 64, Pls.' \nMot. Summ. J.), in which they request that this Court \"grant judgment in favor of all \nPlaintiffs that were strip searched in front of others.\" (!d.  at 2, Pg ID 579.) In that \nMotion, Plaintiffs first summarize the Sixth Circuit's March 2016 decision affirming \nthis  Court's  denial  of qualified  immunity  to  Defendant Warren  as  well  as  the \nprecedents on which that decision relied. (See id. at 5-10, Pg ID 589-94.) Plaintiffs \nthen represent that \"[w]e currently have one hundred and thirty five (135) women \nwho have  alleged that they were  strip while incarcerated at [WHV]  in view of \nothers,\" and argue that summary judgment should be granted as to those individuals. \n(/d.  at 11-14.) Defendants filed a timely Response to Plaintiffs' Motion (ECF No. \n70, Defs.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J.), and Plaintiffs filed a timely Reply (ECF No. 72, \nPis.' Reply Supp. Summ. J.). \n20 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3452    Page 21 of 45\nEach  of the  Reply  briefs  that  Plaintiffs  filed  in  support  of their  class \ncertification  and  summary  judgment  motions  respectively  attached  the  same \nproposed exhibit:  840  pages  of putative  affidavits  signed  by current or former \ninmates of WIN, asserting that the affiant was subjected to strip search procedures \nduring her term of incarceration under different sets of circumstances. (Pls.' Reply \nSupp. Summ. J. Ex. A; Pls.' Reply Supp. Class Cert. Ex. A.) \nThen, on April 3, 20 18-one day before the scheduled hearing on the three \npending Motions-Plaintiffs filed, yet again, two identical supplements to those two \nReply briefs, each of which contained an attached exhibit of 70 additional pages of \nputative affidavits. (ECF Nos. 74, 75.) \nThe Court struck from the record these tardy filings at the hearing on April4, \n2018, the following day, finding that the \"document dump\" the previous evening \nwas unreasonable and vexatious under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. (ECF No. 76.) Further, the \nCourt noted that the April 3, 2018 document dump came after the 840-page dump \non the Court and the Defendant in the February reply brief. \nOn April 5, 2018, the Court issued an Order Striking Exhibits and Imposing \nSanctions stating: \nOn February 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed two reply briefs (ECF Nos. 72, \n73):  one  in  support  of their  previously-filed  Motion  for  Partial \nSummary  Judgment  (ECF  No.  64),  and  one  in  support  of their \npreviously-filed Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. 66). Attached \nas a single exhibit to each of the two reply briefs were 840 pages of \n21 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3453    Page 22 of 45\nputative  affidavits  by  current  or  former  inmates  of  Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections' Women's Huron Valley facility (\"WHV\"), \nwhich Plaintiffs argued evidenced that a substantial number of inmates \nhad been subjected to non-private strip searches while incarcerated at \nWHV. These putative affidavits were filed in no discernible order and \nwithout an index or tabbed pages, and a noticeable proportion of the \nputative affidavits were either unsigned, duplicative of other putative \naffidavits in the same exhibit, or not indicative of whether the author \nhad in fact been subjected to non-private strip searches at WHV. \nThen, on the evening of April 3, 20 18-the day before a scheduled \nhearing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs' Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment, and Defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment  (ECF  No.  65)- Plaintiffs  supplemented  each  of these \nexhibits to their reply briefs with an additional 69 pages of putative \naffidavits  that  followed  the  same  template.  These  tardy  and \nunauthorized submissions were presented without justification, were \nnot organized in any apparent fashion, and included putative affidavits \nduplicative of those contained in the first set. The Court struck these \nsupplemental filings in an Order issued on April4, 2018. (ECF No. 76.) \nThe Court finds that these late filings violated 28 U.S.C.  § 1927 by \nunreasonably and vexatiously impacting the proceedings. \nThe Court also finds that the initial set of putative affidavits that were \nattached as exhibits to Plaintiffs' reply briefs were improper. \"[I]t is \nwell-settled that a party may not raise new issues for the first time in a \nreply brief; he can only respond to arguments raised for the first time in \nthe respondent's response  brief.\" Resolution  Tr.  Corp.  v.  Townsend \nAssocs. Ltd. P'ship, 840 F. Supp. 1127, 1142 (E.D. Mich. 1993) (citing \nUnited States v. Jerkins, 871 F.2d 598 (6th Cir. 1989)). \nIn light of the sheer volume of Plaintiffs' putative affidavits, the lack of \nany apparent attempt to organize them or to screen out duplicates, and \nthe fact that Plaintiffs effectively denied Defendants any meaningful \nopportunity to respond to them by attaching them to their reply briefs, \nthe Court finds  that Plaintiffs'  conduct as  to  the putative affidavits \nneedlessly increased the cost of litigation under Federal Rule of Civil \n22 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3454    Page 23 of 45\nProcedure  11 (b)( 1)  and  ( c )(3 ),  and  unreasonably  and  vexatiously \nmultiplied the proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. \nAccordingly, as discussed on the record at the April 4, 2018 hearing, \nthe Court orders the exhibits to ECF Nos. 72 and 73 STRICKEN from \nthe record in this case and the  images  removed from  the  CMIECF \nsystem. \nThe Court orders Plaintiffs' counsel to reimburse Defendants' counsel \nfor two hours of labor at a rate of $195 per hour, for a total monetary \nsanction of $390. \n(ECF No. 77.) \nOn April  18,  2018,  Plaintiffs  filed  a new  set of affidavits:  561  pages of \naffidavits by current and former WHV inmates. \nAfter a hearing on August  1,  2018, the Court struck Plaintiffs'  affidavits \nbecause Plaintiffs' attorney Kenneth Hardin's submission affidavit was improperly \nsworn (by a Pennsylvania notary). (ECF No. 86.) The Court also noted on the record \nthat  a  random  check  of some  affidavits  contained  inadequate  or  contradictory \nstatements, contained no statements at all, or fell outside the statute of limitations. \nThis filing too violated 28 U.S.C. § 1927. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court \ngave Mr. Hardin two weeks to properly file relevant affidavits. Thereafter, the Court, \nat Mr. Hardin's request, provided him an additional month for filing.3 (ECF No. 89.) \n3 At this point, the proposed affidavits are not part of the record, and not necessary \nto the Court's resolution of the instant Motions for  Summary Judgment. If they \nbecome part of the record subsequently, they will be, of course, relevant to the issue \nof class certification. \n23 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3455    Page 24 of 45\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nSummary judgment is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates that \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. \n317, 322 (1986); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56( a). \"A fact is 'material' for purposes of a motion \nfor  summary  judgment  where  proof of that  fact  'would  have  [the]  effect  of \nestablishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense \nasserted by the parties.\"' Dekarske v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 294 F.R.D. 68,77 (E.D. Mich. \n2013) (Borman, J.) (quoting Kendall v.  Hoover Co., 751  F.2d 171,  174 (6th Cir. \n1984) ). A dispute is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 247-48 (1986). \n\"In  deciding  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,  the  court  must  draw  all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\" Perry v.  Jaguar of Troy, \n353 F.3d 510, 513 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus.  Co.  v.  Zenith \nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). At the same time, the non-movant must \nproduce enough evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find in his or her favor by a \npreponderance  of the  evidence,  Anderson,  477  U.S.  at  252,  and  \"[t]he  'mere \npossibility' of a factual dispute does not suffice to create a triable case.\" Combs v. \nInt'l Ins.

Instead, \"the non-moving party must be able \n24 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3456    Page 25 of 45\nto show sufficient probative evidence [that] would permit a finding in [his] favor on \nmore than mere speculation, conjecture, or fantasy.\" Arendale v.  City of Memphis, \n519 F.3d 587,601 (6th Cir. 2008) (alterations in original) (quoting Lewis v. Philip \nMorris Inc., 355 F.3d 515, 533 (6th Cir. 2004)). \nWhen presented with cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court \"must \nevaluate each motion on its own merits and view all facts and inferences in the light \nmost favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Westfield Ins.  Co.  v.  Tech Dry, Inc., 336 \nF.3d 503, 506 (6th Cir. 2003). \"The fact that the parties have filed cross motions for \nsummary judgment does not automatically justify the conclusion that there are no \nfacts in dispute.\" Ely v. Dearborn Heights School Dist. No.  7, 150 F. Supp. 3d 842, \n849-50 (E.D. Mich. 2015) (citing Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437, 444 (6th \nCir. 2003). In this context, a plaintiff and a defendant have different burdens: \nIn a defensive motion for summary judgment, the party who bears the \nburden of proof must present a jury question as to each element of the \nclaim. Davis v. McCourt, 226 F .3d 506, 511 (6th Cir. 2000). Failure to \nprove an essential element of a claim renders all other facts immaterial \nfor summary judgment purposes. Elvis Presley Enters.,  Inc.  v.  Elvisly \nYours, Inc., 936 F.2d 889, 895 (6th Cir. 1991). \nWhen the moving party also bears the ultimate burden of persuasion, \nthe movant's  affidavits  and other evidence not only must show the \nabsence of a material fact issue, they also must carry that burden. Vance \nv.  Latimer,  648  F.Supp.2d  914,  919  (E.D.  Mich.  2009); see \nalso Resolution  Trust  Corp.  v.  Gill,  960  F.2d  336,  340  (3d  Cir. \n1992); Stat-Tech Liquidating Trust v. Fenster, 981 F .Supp. 1325, 133 5 \n(D. Colo. 1997) (stating that where \"the crucial issue is one on which \n25 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3457    Page 26 of 45\nthe  movant  will  bear  the  ultimate  burden  of  proof  at \ntrial, summary judgment can  be  entered  only  if the  movant submits \nevidentiary materials to establish all of the elements of the claim or \ndefense\"). \nThe plaintiff therefore \"must sustain that burden as well as demonstrate \nthe absence of a genuine dispute. Thus, it must satisfy both the initial \nburden of production on the summary judgment motion-by showing \nthat no genuine dispute exists as to any material fact-and the ultimate \nburden of persuasion on the claim-by showing that it would entitled \nto  a  directed  verdict  at  trial.\"  William  W.  Schwarzer,  et  al.,  The \nAnalysis and Decision of Summary Judgment Motions,  139 F.R.D. \n441, 477-78 (1992) (footnotes omitted). \nEly, 150 F. Supp. 3d at 849-50. \nFinally, all evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment must be \ncapable of presentation in a form that would be admissible at trial. See Alexander v. \nCareSource, 576 F.3d 551,558-59 (6th Cir. 2009) (\"[T]he party opposing summary \njudgment must show that she can make good on the promise of the pleadings by \nlaying out enough evidence that will be admissible at trial to demonstrate that a \ngenuine issue on a material fact exists, and that a trial is necessary.\"). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe Sixth Circuit's March 2016 opinion significantly narrowed the issues in \nthis  case.  In  affirming this  Court's  denial  of qualified  immunity  to  Defendant \nWarren, the Sixth Circuit explained that its precedent has \"held that strip searches \nperformed in view of other inmates without a legitimate penological justification \nviolates  inmates'  clearly established  Fourth Amendment rights.\"  Salem,  643  F. \n26 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3458    Page 27 of 45\nApp'x at 530 (citing Williams, 771 F.3d at 952-56 and Stoudemire, 705 F.3d at 572-\n75). And while the Sixth Circuit observed that \"Plaintiffs pair their public-viewing \nallegations with claims that guards forced the inmates to sit naked on an unwashed \nand unsanitized chair wet with bodily fluids from other prisoners\" and that such \nclaims also serve to \"amplify [the searches'] invasiveness,\" the court went on to \n\"uphold the judgment of the district court denying qualified immunity to Warren \nregarding the non-private searches.\" (!d.  at 6 (emphasis added).) Thus, \"the Sixth \nCircuit's  decision  affirmed this  Court's holding that Defendant Warren was  not \nprotected  by  qualified  immunity  to  the  extent  that  the  subject  searches  were \nperformed in full view of other female prisoners.\" (December 2016 Opinion and \nOrder at 9, Pg ID 514.) These decisions have made clear that the scope of Plaintiffs' \naction is now limited to strip searches performed in the presence of individuals other \nthan  the  officer  and  the  inmate,  for  whose  presence  there  was  no  legitimate \npenological justification. \nA.  Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Qualified Immunity \nDefendants make two arguments for summary judgment. First, they argue that \nPlaintiffs have failed to show that Defendant Warren directly participated in or even \ntacitly authorized the sort of \"non-private searches\" that the Sixth Circuit found to \nbe unconstitutional in the March 2016 opinion, and then argue that this precludes \nliability for Warren under Section 1983 both on the merits and under the doctrine of \n27 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3459    Page 28 of 45\nqualified  immunity.  Second,  they  contend that prospective  injunctive  relief for \ncontinuing violations of law is not available to Plaintiffs in this case. As discussed \nin detail below, the Court, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non \nmoving party, finds that fact issues preclude summary judgment on both of these \ngrounds, and will therefore deny Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and \nQualified Immunity. \n1.  Defendant Warren's Individual Liability \n\"[T]he § 1983 liability of supervisory personnel must be based on more than \nthe right to control employees. Section 1983 liability will not be imposed solely upon \nthe basis of respondeat superior.\" Bellamy v.  Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 421  (6th Cir. \n1984) (citing Hays v. Jefferson County, 668 F.2d 869 (6th Cir. 1982)). \"Supervisory \nliability under § 1983 does not attach when it is premised on a mere failure to act; it \n'must be based on active unconstitutional behavior.\"' Greene v.  Barber, 310 F .3d \n889, 899 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Bass v. Robinson, 167 F.3d 1041, 1048 (6th Cir. \n1999)).  It follows  from  this  that \"[a]  supervisory  official's  failure  to  supervise, \ncontrol or train the offending individual is not actionable unless the supervisor either \nencouraged  the  specific  incident  of misconduct  or  in  some  other way  directly \nparticipated in it.\" Peatross v.  City of Memphis, 818 F.3d 233, 242 (6th Cir. 2016) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shehee v.  Luttrell, 199 F.3d 295, 300 \n(6th Cir. 1999)). The Sixth Circuit has \"interpreted this standard to mean that 'at a \n28 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3460    Page 29 of 45\nminimum,' the plaintiff must show that the defendant 'at least implicitly authorized, \napproved, or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of the offending \nofficers.\"' !d. (quoting Shehee, 199 F .3d at 300). \nIn short, \"[t]he acts of one's subordinates or the mere failure to act standing \nalone are not enough to hold a supervisor liable.\" Thames v.  City of Westland, 310 \nF. Supp. 3d 783 (B.D. Mich. 2018) (quoting Summers v. Leis, 368 F.3d 881,888 (6th \nCir.  2004)).  The  distinction  between  implicit  authorization  or  knowing \nacquiescence, on the one hand, and \"mere failure to act,\" on the other, is not always \nclear. Still, recent case law provides some guidance as to what may constitute the \nrequisite affirmative conduct on the part of a supervisory official.  For example, \nactively assisting subordinates in covering up constitutional violations after the fact \nis  sufficient.  See  Coley v.  Lucas  Cty.,  Ohio,  799 F.3d 530, 542  (6th Cir.  2015) \n(finding that a plaintiff had  sufficient alleged that a defendant  sheriff \"at least \nimplicitly authorized,  approved  or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional \nconduct of the offending subordinate when he helped [subordinate officers] to cover \nup their unconstitutional actions\" by making false statements to federal officials) \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  The  Sixth  Circuit  has  also  found  that  a \nsupervisor's  failure  to  properly  train  subordinates,  failure  to  investigate  their \nconstitutional violations, and adoption of a custom of exonerating such violations in \na way that effectively gives \"the green light\" to those who would commit them in \n29 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3461    Page 30 of 45\nthe future can justify liability under Section 1983. Peatross v.  City ofM  emphis, 818 \nF.3d 233, 241-45 (6th Cir. 2016). In addition, \"a supervisor may be liable under§ \n1983  if he abandon[ s]  the specific duties of his position ..  . in the face  of actual \nknowledge of a breakdown in the proper workings of the department,\" provided that \n\"some execution of the supervisors' job function result[s] in [the p]laintiffs injury.\" \nWinkler  v.  Madison  Cty.,  893  F.3d  877,  898-99  (6th  Cir.  2018)  (alterations in \noriginal)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citations  omitted).  Lastly,  supervisory \nliability  may  exist where  \"a history  of widespread  abuse  puts  the  responsible \nsupervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and [she] fails to \ndo  so,\" in a way that demonstrates \"a causal connection between actions of the \nsupervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation .... The deprivations \nthat constitute widespread abuse sufficient to notify the supervising official must be \nobvious,  flagrant,  rampant,  and  of  continued  duration,  rather  than  isolated \noccurrences.\" Curran v.  City of Dearborn, 957 F. Supp. 2d 877, 888 (E.D. Mich. \n2013) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Doe v. City \nof Roseville, 296  F.3d 431,  440  (6th  Cir.  2002)).  See also  Campbell v.  City of \nSpringboro,  Ohio,  700  F.3d 779,  790  (6th Cir.  2012)  (holding that supervisory \nliability could be based on a causal connection between a police chiefs acts or \nomissions and constitutional injuries caused by a police dog, where the chief allowed \nthe  dog  into  the  field  after his training had  lapsed,  \"never required appropriate \n30 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3462    Page 31 of 45\nsupervision of the canine unit and essentially allowed it to run itself,\" \"failed to \nestablish and publish an official K-9 unit policy,\" was \"seemingly oblivious to the \nincreasing  frequency  of dog-bite  incidents,\"  and  ignored  \"many  complaints\" \nregarding  the  need  to  further  train  the  dog,  such  that  the  chiefs  \"apparent \nindifference to maintaining a properly functioning K-9 unit could be reasonably \nexpected to give rise to just the sort of injuries that occurred\"). \nIn the instant case, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show that \nWarren was sufficiently involved in the unconstitutional search practices at issue. \nDefendants note that at all relevant times, WHV policy \"required sanitary napkins \nto  be  used  on  the  chair  during  searches,  and  that the  searches  could  only  be \nconducted by and in front of female employees.\" (Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 2, Pg ID \n613.) As Warren \"did not authorize these policies to be violated, did not encourage \nstaff to violate these policies, and did not personally conduct searches in violation \nof these policies,\" Defendants maintain, she was not personally involved enough in \nany improper searches to justify individual liability against her. (!d.) \nPlaintiffs  counter that their  evidence  does  adequately  connect  Warren to \nunconstitutional  strip  searches,  in  that  it  demonstrates  her  knowledge  of the \nconstitutional violations and her failure to provide adequate training. 4 In particular, \n4 There is some ambiguity based on Plaintiffs' briefs as to whether their argument is \nthat  Warren  is  liable  as  a  policymaker,  or  that  her  unlawful  conduct  was \nacquiescence to violations by her employees-at times, Plaintiffs appear to argue \n31 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3463    Page 32 of 45\nthey  cite  Warren's testimony that she  was  made  aware  of inmates'  complaints \nregarding  strip  search  procedures  through  formal  grievances,  and  through \ndiscussions at \"Warden's Forum Committee\" (\"WFC\") meetings, which Warren \nconducted periodically in order to share news with the inmate population and to \nallow inmates to discuss issues of concern to them. (Warren Dep. 12:20-13:6.) As \nexhibits to their Response, Plaintiffs have attached meeting minutes from four WFC \nmeetings-three  in  2009  and  one  in  20 11-at which  attendees  raised  issues \nregarding strip search procedures. (Pis.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J. Exs. 8-11.) Plaintiffs \nhave  also  submitted records  of four  grievances  filed  by  four  different  inmates \nregarding the strip search procedures, including one filed by Keshuna Abcumby, one \nof the two individual Plaintiffs in the case. (Pis.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J. Exs. 12-15.) \nCiting all of this, Plaintiffs argue that \"the need for training may not have been \nobvious from the outset, but the pattern of constitutional violations put Defendant \nboth. (See, e.g., Pis.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J. at 17, Pg ID 788 (\"Here, it has been \nshown  that  the  policymaker  was  aware  of,  and  acquiesced  in,  a  pattern  of \nconstitutional violations involving the exercise of policy implementation.\").) To the \nextent that Plaintiffs' argument is based on formal policies, in any case, it lacks \nmerit.  Assuming that Warren exercised sufficient control  over those policies to \nqualify her as a \"policymaker,\" Plaintiffs have cited no provision of PD 04.04.11 0, \nWHV -OP-04.04.11 0, or any other policy that authorized officers to conduct strip \nsearches on inmates in the presence of other inmates. Indeed, WHV- OP-04.04.11 0 \nexpressly provided-at least as of May 2009, the date of the earliest version in the \nrecord-that any \"strip search of a prisoner at WHV must be conducted by and only \nin the presence of female employees\" (WHV-OP-04.04.110 at 3, Pg ID 129), and \nthere is no indication that this rule was later altered, by Warren or anyone else. \n32 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3464    Page 33 of 45\nWarden on notice that the officers confront the particular situation on a regular basis, \nand that they often reacted in a manner contrary to constitutional requirements.\" \n(Pis.' Resp. Opp'n Summ. J. at 17, Pg ID 788.) \nDefendants are correct when they point out that Plaintiffs have offered no \ndirect evidence of Warren's participation in, or even her knowledge of any non \nprivate strip searches conducted in the presence of other inmates at WHY. The four \nsets ofWFC meeting minutes reflect complaints by inmates that the procedures were \ninvasive, that they were unhygienic, that they required some inmates to violate their \nown religious practices, and that they could be traumatic to prisoners with histories \nof sexual abuse, but they make no mention of strip searches that were conducted in \nthe presence of other inmates, male corrections officers, or persons not part of the \ncorrections staff. The same is true of the four sets of grievance records submitted by \nPlaintiffs:  they  variously  relate  the  individual  grievants'  mental  distress,  post \ntraumatic reactions, feelings of degradation, health and hygiene concerns, and fears \nof grievance-related  retaliation,  but they  contain  no  reference  to  strip  searches \nconducted in the presence of any persons who were not female corrections officers. \nNevertheless, even given this absence of direct proof, the record at this stage \ncontains sufficient evidence on which a reasonable jury could find  that Warren \nimplicitly  authorized or knowingly  acquiesced  in  a  custom of non-private  strip \nsearches. This conclusion rests primarily on Plaintiffs' allegation in the Complaint \n33 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3465    Page 34 of 45\nthat Defendants \"conduct[e d]  spread-labia vaginal searches on numerous female \nprisoners in full view of one another\" (Compl. ~ 19(b)), and on a February 2014 \naffidavit signed by named Plaintiff Keshuna Abcumby, which Plaintiffs attached to \ntheir response to Defendants' initial Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment \nBased upon Qualified Immunity, filed in early 2014. (ECF No. 17 Ex. 5, Pg ID 207-\n09.) In that affidavit, Plaintiff Abcumby attested that she was subjected to strip \nsearches involving the \"use of an unsanitized chair at least 10 times\" in 2011  and \n2012, and that \"[t]hese searches were done in view of other people.\" (!d.~~ 3, 6, 15.) \nBased on the foregoing, this Court finds that a reasonable jury could determine that \nWarren implicitly authorized or knowingly acquiesced in a pattern or custom of \nconstitutionally violative strip searches. \nThe Court recognizes that Warren testified in her deposition that WHV policy \nrequired strip searches to be conducted in private, only in the presence of female \ncorrections officers, and on a one-on-one basis (except in some situations involving \ntrainee corrections officers), and that strip searches were generally conducted in a \nprivate room with no window on the door. (Warren Dep. 49:12-50:13.) Warren also \naverred in her own sworn affidavit that she did not instruct or encourage corrections \nofficers  to  violate  that  policy,  nor  did  she  \"implicitly  authorize,  approve  or \nknowingly acquiesce in staff conducting strip searches of prisoners in view of other \nprisoners or to conduct strip searches in an unsanitary manner.\" (Dec. 2017 Warren \n34 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3466    Page 35 of 45\nAff. ~ 3.) At the same time, in light of the Warden's Forum Committee meeting notes \nevidencing improper searches, and Abcumby' s affidavit, and drawing all reasonable \nfactual inferences in favor of Plaintiffs at this stage, the Court finds that a jury could \nreasonably find in favor of Plaintiffs. \nThe  parties  do  not  dispute  that  MDOC  received  at  least  67  gnevances \nregarding some aspect of the chair portion oft he strip search between 2009 and 20 11. \nThus, even though the four sets of grievance documents and the four sets of WFC \nmeeting minutes that Plaintiffs have offered do not directly evidence any specific \ngrievance or complaint regarding non-private strip searches, a reasonable jury could \nstill  find  on  this  record  that  Warren's  \"apparent  indifference  to\"  a  pattern  of \nconstitutional violations \"could be reasonably expected to give rise to just the sort \nof injuries that occurred.\" Campbell, 100 F.3d at 790. \nDefendants also raise a separate argument that Warren is entitled to qualified \nimmunity with respect to Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim as asserted against \nher  in  her  individual  capacity.  \"The  doctrine  of qualified immunity protects \ngovernment officials 'from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does \nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable \nperson  would  have  known.\"'  Pearson  v.  Callahan, 555  U.S.  223,  231 \n(2009) (quoting Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald, 451  U.S.  800,  818  (1982)). The \nqualified immunity doctrine requires the court to determine: (1) \"whether the facts \n35 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3467    Page 36 of 45\nthat a plaintiff has alleged ... make out a violation of a constitutional right\" and (2) \n\"whether the right at issue was 'clearly established' at the time of [the] defendant's \nalleged misconduct.\" /d.  at 232 (citations omitted) (quoting Saucier v.  Katz,  533 \nU.S.  194, 201  (2001)).  The crux of Defendants'  argument in this regard is that \nbecause Plaintiffs have failed to make any showing that Warren was personally \ninvolved in (and thus responsible for)  any constitutional violations at all,  she is \nnecessarily entitled to assert qualified immunity. \nAs  discussed  above,  however,  Plaintiffs  have  raised  a  genuine  Issue  of \nmaterial  fact over whether an ongoing pattern of constitutionally violative  strip \nsearches  can  be  attributed  to  Warren's  implicit  authorization  of or  knowing \nacquiescence to such searches, even if they were conducted in violation of a formal \npolicy promulgated by MDOC, WHV, or both. Defendants' argument must fail for \nthis reason. Additionally, although Defendants have not made any specific argument \nbased on the \"clearly established\" prong of the qualified immunity test, the Sixth \nCircuit expressly held in its March 2016 opinion in this matter that \"'the right not to \nbe subjected to a humiliating strip search in full view of several (or perhaps many) \nothers'  was  clearly  established  by  February  2007-two  years  before  Warren \nimplemented the chair searches at issue.\" Salem,  643  F.  App'x at 531  (quoting \nStoudemire v. Mich. Dep't ofCorr., 705 F.3d 560, 575 (6th Cir. 2013)). \nThe  principle  that  supervisory  liability  for  constitutional  violations  by \n36 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3468    Page 37 of 45\nsubordinates may attach under  Section  1983  based on implicit authorization  or \nknowing  acquiescence  was  clearly  established  by  the  time  Warren  assumed \nsupervisory responsibility for  WHV' s search procedures as well. See Phillips v. \nRoane Cty.,  Tenn.,  534 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"A supervisor is not liable \npursuant to § 1983 for failing to train unless the supervisor 'either encouraged the \nspecific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly participated in it. At a \nminimum  a  plaintiff must  show that the  official  at  least  implicitly  authorized, \napproved, or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of the offending \nofficers.\"') (emphasis added) (quoting Shehee v. Luttrell, 199 F .3d 295, 300 (6th Cir. \n1999)). See also Doe ex ref. Doe v.  City of Roseville, 296 F.3d 431,440 (6th Cir. \n2002)  (\"[S]upervisor liability  [under §  1983]  occurs either when the supervisor \npersonally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there  is  a \ncausal  connection  between  actions  of the  supervising  official  and  the  alleged \nconstitutional deprivation. The causal connection can be established when a history \nof widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct \nthe alleged deprivation, and he [she] fails to do so. The deprivations that constitute \nwidespread  abuse  sufficient to  notify  the  supervising official  must be  obvious, \nflagrant,  rampant,  and  of continued duration,  rather than isolated occurrences.\") \n(quoting Braddy v. Florida Dep't ofL  abor & Employment Sec., 133 F.3d 797, 802 \n(11th Cir. 1998)). \n37 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3469    Page 38 of 45\nFinally, the Court notes that even though \"the right not to be subjected to a \nhumiliating strip search in full view of several (or perhaps many) others was clearly \nestablished by February 2007,\" Salem, 643 F. App'x at 531 (internal quotation marks \nomitted), the Sixth Circuit has spoken again on this topic in the time since it issued \nits opinion in this case in March 2016. In Sumpter v.  Wayne Cty., 868 F.3d 473 (6th \nCir. 2017), the Sixth Circuit recognized that even strip searches performed in the \npresence  of  other  inmates,  while  undeniably  intrusive,  may  nonetheless  be \nconstitutionally permissible where they are justified by a legitimate penological \ninterest such as the maintenance of the health and safety of other inmates, which \nmight otherwise be compromised by long delays caused by private strip searches. \nSee id.  at 485  (\"[W]e accord considerable deference to defendants' assertion that \nthey  conducted  group  strip  searches  when  the  high  volume  of inmates  and \nconcomitant effect of delays on inmate health and safety demanded it. ... [O]n one \nhand,  the  group  strip  searches plaintiff endured in the Registry were especially \nintrusive;  on the  other hand,  defendants  have  asserted  a  legitimate  penological \njustification  for  periodically  conducting  the  searches.\").  In  this  case,  however, \nDefendants  have  not asserted that non-private  strip  searches were  conducted at \nWHV  in  order to  protect the  inmates'  health,  safety,  or  some  other legitimate \npenological interest; Defendants' position is simply that to any extent such strip \nsearches did occur, they cannot be attributed to any act or omission by Warren. \n38 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3470    Page 39 of 45\nBecause Plaintiffs have demonstrated the  existence of a genuine  issue  of \nmaterial fact regarding Warren's implicit authorization of, or knowing acquiescence \nto,  a  pattern  or  custom  of non-private  strip  searches  that  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment rights of the inmates that were subjected to them, the Court will deny \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Qualified Immunity as to Plaintiffs' \nindividual-capacity claim against Warren. \n2.  Prospective Injunctive Relief as to MDOC \nPlaintiffs also seek prospective injunctive relief in this matter: specifically, a \n\"Permanent Injunction prohibiting Defendants from subjecting Plaintiffs to policies \nand procedures that violate their constitutional, statutory rights, and common law \nrights.\" (Compl. at 14, Pg ID 14.) In its May 2015 Opinion and Order Granting in \nPart and Denying in Part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment \nBased  on  Qualified  Immunity,  this  Court  rejected  Defendants'  argument  that \nPlaintiffs'  request  for  injunctive  relief was  moot  because  the  chair-based  strip \nsearches had been formally abolished as a routine practice in 2011, and concluded \nbased on \"Plaintiffs' allegations of on-going strip searches which involve the use of \na chair ... that these searches are on-going and that the possibility of prospective \nrelief remains viable.\" (May 2015 Opinion and Order at 37-38, Pg ID 275-76.) On \nappeal, the Sixth Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' request for \ninjunctive relief. See Salem, 643  F. App 'x at 531  Defendants now argue that the \n39 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3471    Page 40 of 45\nrequest  is  moot  both  on  Eleventh  Amendment  grounds  and  under  the  Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626. \nThe Eleventh Amendment \"protects states, as well as state officials sued in \ntheir official capacity for money damages, from suit in federal court. It also applies \nto state agencies or departments ....\"  Boler v.  Earley, 865 F.3d 391, 409-10 (6th \nCir. 20 17) (internal citations omitted). One well-recognized exception to this form \nof immunity is relevant to this case, however: \"a federal court may, without violating \nthe Eleventh Amendment, issue a prospective injunction against a state officer to \nend a continuing violation of federal law.\" Price v.  Medicaid Dir., 838 F.3d 739, \n746-47 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908)). The Ex \nparte  Young  doctrine  \"does not  ...  extend  to  any  retroactive  relief.\"  Puckett v. \nLexington-Fayette Urban  Cty.  Gov't, 833  F.3d 590, 598 (6th Cir. 2016) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting S & M Brands, Inc. v. Cooper, 527 F .3d 500, 507 \n(6th  Cir.  2008)).  '\"[A]  court need  only  conduct  a  straightforward  inquiry  into \nwhether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief \nproperly characterized as prospective' to determine whether the Ex parte Young \ndoctrine avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit.\" Diaz v.  Michigan Dep't of \nCorr., 703 F.3d 956, 965 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting Verizon Maryland Inc. v. Public \nService Commission ofM  aryland, 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002)). \nAdditionally, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") provides: \n40 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3472    Page 41 of 45\nProspective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions \nshall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the \nFederal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not \ngrant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such \nrelief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct \nthe violation  of the  Federal  right,  and  is  the  least  intrusive  means \nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall \ngive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the \noperation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief. \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). \nDefendants' arguments based on the Ex parte Young doctrine and the PLRA \nare both premised on the assertion that Warren \"ended the routine use of the chair \nportion of the strip search policy on December 16, 20 11, ... well before Plaintiffs \nbrought the instant suit.\" (ECF No. 65, Defs.' Mot.  Summ. J.  (citing May 2015 \nOpinion and Order at 11-12, Pg ID 249-50).) Consequently, Defendants argue, there \nis no ongoing violation of federal law that would warrant injunctive relief. \nDefendants are  correct that Warren issued an order in late 20 11  formally \nending \"the routine use of the chair portion of the strip search policy\" at WHV in \nlate 2011, pursuant to a memorandum that she issued on December 14, 2011. (ECF \nNo. 11 Ex. A, Jan. 2014 Warren Aff. Ex. A, December 2011 Memorandum.) But in \nlight of the Sixth Circuit's March 2016 opinion in this case, this action is no longer \nstrictly concerned with the use, routine or otherwise, of the chair portion of the strip \nsearch policy. What is at issue now in this case is the use of non-private strip search \nprocedures-a practice that has in fact been prohibited under the relevant policies \n41 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3473    Page 42 of 45\nfor the entirety of the time period in question. Moreover, as discussed above, there \nis a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a custom or pattern of \nemploying that practice irrespective of its status under MDOC and WHV policies. \nWarren's formal termination of the routine use of the chair portion of the strip search \npolicy in December 20 11 is therefore immaterial to Plaintiffs' claim for prospective \ninjunctive relief; what matters at present is whether there is an ongoing custom or \npattern of non-private strip searches. \nDefendants also rely on the Supreme Court's decision in City ofL  os Angeles \nv. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), but that case does not support Defendants' argument. \nLyons had to do with the doctrine of standing rather than Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity, and it involved a request for injunctive relief by a plaintiff who had been \ninjured when he was placed in a chokehold by a police officer. The issue before the \nCourt in Lyons was whether the plaintiff had standing to enjoin the police department \nfrom using chokeholds like that which had been used on him in the future, and the \nCourt explained that this issue depended in tum on \"whether he was likely to suffer \nfuture injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.\" !d.  at  105. The \nCourt's conclusion that the plaintiff lacked standing was grounded in the principle \nthat for purposes of standing, \"[a] bstract injury is not enough. The plaintiff must \nshow that he 'has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct \ninjury' as the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of \n42 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3474    Page 43 of 45\ninjury must be both 'real and immediate,' not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.\"' Id. at \n101-02. In this case, the risk of the asserted harm occurring in the future is more \nconcrete than it was in Lyons. See id. at 108 (\"We cannot agree that the 'odds' that \nLyons would not only again be stopped for a traffic violation but would also be \nsubjected to a chokehold without any provocation whatsoever are sufficient to make \nout a federal case for equitable relief. We note that five months elapsed between [the \nincident]  and the filing  of the complaint, yet there was no allegation of further \nunfortunate encounters between Lyons and the police.\"). \nPlaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief comes before the Court on Defendants' \nsummary  judgment  motion;  the  question  presented  is  whether,  drawing  all \nreasonable factual inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, there remains any genuine factual \nissue  over  the  existence  of a  real  and  immediate  threat  of injury  based  on \nconstitutionally  violative  non-private  strip  search  procedures.  And  given  the \nevidence before the Court, the Court will reserve judgment on this issue pending \ntrial. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  will  at  this  time  deny  Defendants'  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment or Qualified Immunity as to Plaintiffs'  claim for injunctive \nrelief. \nB.  Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nPlaintiffs  have  filed  a  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment,  seeking \n43 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3475    Page 44 of 45\n\"judgment in favor of all Plaintiffs that were strip searched in front of others.\" (Pis.' \nMot.  Summ.  J.  at 2,  Pg ID 579.) In that Motion, Plaintiffs note that they have \nassembled a large number of inmates and former inmates \"who have alleged that \nthey were strip [searched] while incarcerated at WHVCF in view of others.\" (!d. at \n11, Pg ID 595.) Then, after summarizing the holdings in the Sixth Circuit's March \n2016 opinion, as well as several cases that the Sixth Circuit relied upon in reaching \nthose holdings, Plaintiffs argue that \n[b]ased upon the Court of Appeal's prior decision on this exact matter \nand the foregoing case law unequivocally finding that body cavity strip \nsearches  performed  in  view  of  others  without  justification  are \nunconstitutional, this Court must find that this type [o fJ egregious strip \nsearch forcing these women to use their hands to touch their vaginas \nwhile sitting fully exposed on a chair, in view of others, is a violation \nof their Fourth Amendment Rights. As such, summary judgment must \nbe granted as to the women who were strip searched in front of other \ninmates  and  third  parties,  not necessary  to  the  strip  search,  while \nincarcerated at WHVCF. As such, summary judgment must be granted \nas to the women who were strip searched in front of other inmates and \nthird parties, not necessary to the strip search, while incarcerated at \nWHVCF. \n(!d. at 14, Pg ID 598.) \nAs Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment does little more than summarize the law of the case.  While the Sixth \nCircuit did  conclude that the type of search described by Plaintiffs violates the \nFourth  Amendment-and  that  this  principle  was  clearly  established  prior  to \n44 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 90   filed 08/24/18    PageID.3476    Page 45 of 45\nWarren's assumption of supervisory responsibility over inmate search procedures at \nWHV- this does not resolve any issues in Plaintiffs' favor that were not already \nresolved by the Sixth Circuit. Questions of fact remain as to whether Defendant \nWarren  implicitly  authorized  or  knowingly  acquiesced  in  Fourth  Amendment \nviolations at WHV- an issue which the Sixth Circuit expressly did not reach on \nprocedural grounds, see Salem, 643 F. App'x at 530- and also as to whether such \nviolations  are  ongoing.  Accordingly, the  CoUli  will  deny Plaintiffs'  Motion for \nPa1iial Summary Judgment. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor all of the reasons stated above, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants' \nMotion for Sununary Judgment and Qualified Immunity, and DENIES Plaintiffs' \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nPaul D. Borman \nUnited States District Judge \n45 ",

This proposed class action lawsuit seeks injunctive and declaratory relief and \ndamages on behalf of women confined in the all-women Huron Valley Correctional Facility \n(“Huron Valley”) operated by the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”).   During the \nlast three years, over 1,900 women have been incarcerated in Huron Valley, MDOCs only \nfemale prison. \n2.  During their imprisonment, these women have been routinely and regularly \nsubjected to Defendants’ conducting body cavity searches whereby female prisoners, in addition \nto standard strip search, were and are required to sit on an unsanitized chair and use their \nunsanitized hands to spread their genitals, allowing a guard to visually search their vagina for \nany hidden contraband (“spread-labia searches”). \n3.  Despite representations by MDOC and its officials that the practice would be \ndiscontinued in December 2011, the spread-labia searches have continued to date. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  4.  This is a civil action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief together with monetary damages against Defendants for violations of Eighth \nand Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. \n  5.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 which authorizes Federal \ncourts to decide cases concerning federal questions, and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4) which \nauthorizes Federal courts to hear civil rights cases.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the \nDefendants named herein as public officials of the State of Michigan sued in their official and \nindividual capacities for violations of Plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional rights.  The amount \nin controversy exceeds Seventy-Five Thousand ($75,000.00) Dollars. \n  6.  Venue is proper in this court as Defendants conduct their business in the County \n  2 \n    \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 3 of 15    Pg ID 3\n   \n \nof Washtenaw in the Eastern District of Michigan and the named Plaintiffs are or were \nincarcerated in the Eastern District of Michigan during the relevant time periods. \nPARTIES \nA.  PLAINTIFFS \n7.  Plaintiff representatives are citizens of the United States and at all relevant times \nwere imprisoned in Huron Valley under the jurisdiction of the MDOC.  Plaintiffs bring this \naction on behalf of themselves and a class of prisoners who are, were or will be confined in \nHuron Valley and who have been or will be subjected to sexual and physical assaults and abuse, \nsexual harassment, and degrading, sexually humiliating and unhygienic treatment from Huron \nValley correctional officers and staff. \nB.  DEFENDANTS \n8.  Defendant MDOC is a Department of the State of Michigan responsible for the \ncare and custody of prisoners incarcerated in the State of Michigan.  Defendant MDOC have the \nresponsibility, authority and ability to remedy current and future conditions at Huron Valley that \nhave given rise to the sexual harassment, degrading, sexually humiliating and unhygienic \ntreatment, and deprivation of rights as set forth in this Complaint. \n9.  Defendant Daniel H. Heyns (“Heyns”) is the Director of the Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections.  His duties and responsibilities include a responsibility for \ndeveloping and implementing policies and procedures for the operation and management of the \nMichigan Department of Civil Rights and its employees.  He is responsible for the care, custody \nand protection of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections. \n  3 \n   \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 4 of 15    Pg ID 4\n   \n \n10.  Defendant Thomas Finco (“Finco”) is the Deputy Director of the MDOC’s \nCorrectional Facilities Administration (“CFA”) and has served in that capacity since October 1, \n2011.  Defendant Finco’s duties and responsibilities include the operation of all correctional \ninstitutions in the MDOC system, including promulgating and administering MDOC’s policies. \n11.  Defendant Dennis Straub (“Straub”) was the Deputy Director of the CFA before \nOctober 1, 2011.  His duties and responsibilities included the promulgation and administration of \nMDOC policies. \n12.  Defendant Randy Treacher (“Treacher”) is the Chief Deputy Director of the CFA. \nHis duties and responsibilities include the supervision of Defendants Straub and Finco during \ntheir respective terms. \n13.  Defendant Millicent Warren was and is the Warden of Huron Valley.  Her \nresponsibilities and duties include the training, assignment, supervision, discipline and \ninvestigation of correctional officers and MDOC employees at Huron Valley.  She is responsible \nfor the unlawful treatment to which the Plaintiffs were subjected. \n14.  Defendant Warden Warren is also responsible for the custody, safety, protection, \nfair treatment and rehabilitation of the prisoners in Huron Valley and for ensuing that Huron \nValley is operated according to proper correctional standards, statutes and/or laws to ensure the \nsafety and protection of vulnerable populations, including Plaintiffs. \n15.  Defendant Warden Warren is also responsible for developing procedures and \nimplementing policies to prevent the sexual abuse and degrading treatment of Huron Valley’s \nfemale prisoners and for ensuing an adequate and effective mechanism for the safe and effective \nreporting of sexual harassment and degrading, sexually humiliating and unhygienic treatment \nexperienced by female prisoners housed at Huron Valley. \n \n  4 \n    \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 5 of 15    Pg ID 5\n   \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  16.  This action is brought by the named Plaintiffs on behalf of female prisoners who, \nsince October 2010, have been, are now, or will be hereafter incarcerated at Huron Valley under \nthe jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections and who have been subjected to \nsexual harassment and degrading and unhygienic treatment by MDOC custodial staff. \n  17.  The number of women who have been subjected to these violations of their rights \nwhile under the jurisdiction of the MDOC since 2010 exceeds 100 women.  The number of class \nmembers is sufficiently numerous to make class action status the most practical method for \nPlaintiffs to challenge the policies, procedures and practices of Defendants that are a proximate \ncause of their ongoing abuse. \n  18.  There are questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffs’ claims \ncommon to, and typical of, those raised by the Class they seek to represent. \n  19.  Questions of law or fact common to the Class, without limitation, include: \na.  Defendants’ conducting body cavity searches on female prisoners whereby \nfemale prisoners, in addition to standard strip search, were required to sit \non an unsanitized chair and use their unsanitized hands to spread their \ngenitals, allowing a guard to visually search their vaginal and anal cavities \nfor any hidden contraband. \nb.  Defendants’ conducting spread-labia vaginal searches on numerous female \nprisoners in full view of one another. \nc.  Defendants’ failure to properly supervise, train, monitor, discipline and/or \nregulate prison staff and failure to properly protect this vulnerable \npopulation resulting in sexual harassment and degrading and unhygienic \ntreatment. \n  5 \n   \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 6 of 15    Pg ID 6\n   \n \nd.  Defendants’ ongoing failure to promulgate and implement proper policies \nand procedures to protect female prisoners and properly supervise, train, \nand discipline prison staff in violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional, \ncommon law, and statutory rights. \n20.  The violations of law and resulting harms alleged by the named Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all Class members. \n21.  Plaintiff Class members will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nPlaintiff class members.  Plaintiffs’ counsel knows of no conflicts of interest between the class \nrepresentatives and absent class members with respect to the matters at issue in this litigation;  \nthe class representatives will vigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of the Class;  and the class \nrepresentatives are represented by experienced counsel.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys \nwith substantial experience and expertise in complex and class action litigation involving the \nissues in this litigation.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all \nclaims in this action, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class. \n21.   The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available \nmethods of adjudication and will promote the convenient administration of justice.  Moreover, \nthe prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class could result in \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class and/or one \nor more of the Defendants. \n22.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nPlaintiffs, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class. \n  6 \n    \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 7 of 15    Pg ID 7\n   \n \nSTATEMENT OF GENERAL FACTS \n  23.  Since 2009, all female prisoners under the jurisdiction of the MDOC have been \nincarcerated at Huron Valley. \n  24.  Pursuant to a MDOC strip search training video from 1998, standard strip \nsearches included the removal of all clothing and requiring the female prisoner to go through a \nseries of movements intended to reveal if anything is being concealed, including bending and \ncoughing, as well as spreading the buttocks cheeks for visual inspection.   \n  25.  In addition to the standard strip search, additional spread-labia search was and is \nregularly performed whereby the female prisoner is required to sit naked on an unwashed and \nunsanitized chair wet with bodily fluids from other prisoners, with her legs spread, and use her \nown unwashed hands to spread her labia for guard inspection. \n  26.  Female prisoners carrying communicable diseases such as HIV, AIDS, \ntuberculosis, hepatitis C, sexually transmitted diseases, and other vaginal infections have been \nforced to submit to spread-labia searches while on their menstrual cycles, leaving blood on the \nchair. \n  27.  The spread-labia search was and is performed on female prisoners after they have \ncontact visits, finish shifts in prison jobs, receive medical care, and at other arbitrary times \ndictated by MDOC officials. \n  28.  On December 13, 2011, responding to complaints and grievances about the \nprocedure from 2009 to 2011, Warden Warren issued a Notice to Staff directing that the \n“procedure of requiring the prisoner to sit in a chair lined with sanitary paper and manually \nspreading the labia as to inspect the entrance of the vagina is no longer authorized as of 0600 \nhours on Friday, December 16, 2011.” \n  29.  On April 12, 2012, the Americans Civil Liberties Union transmitted a letter to \n  7 \n   \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 8 of 15    Pg ID 8\n   \n \nMDOC demanding for a “decisive end” to the spread-labia search practice.  The letter was also \nsigned by 34 human rights, health, legal and religious organizations and individuals. \n  30.  At the time of the filing of this Complaint, the spread-labia search practice \ncontinues at Huron Valley and prisoners continue to file grievances regarding the procedure. \n  31.  In contravention of MDOC’s policies and/or standard correctional practices, \nDefendants have conducted and continue to conduct sexually humiliating, degrading, unhygienic \nand unconstitutional spread-labia searches of female prisoners. \n  32.  Defendants, without adequate procedures, training or supervision, have subjected \nfemale prisoners to spread-labia searches without taking adequate steps to protect their health, \nsafety, privacy and rights. \n  33.  Defendants have failed to implement and effectuate policies, procedures and \nmechanisms to deter the sexually humiliating, degrading, unhygienic and unconstitutional \nspread-labia searches of female prisoners. \n  34.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omission in failing to safeguard female \nemployees, the plaintiffs in this case have all experienced sexual harassment, sexual humiliation, \nembarrassment, psychological trauma, and fear. \n  35.  Defendants’ mechanisms for addressing grievances through an administrative \nprocess are ineffective and futile for Plaintiffs’ complaints as Defendants do not provide an \nadequate or available system to exhaust their claims administratively. \n  36.  Plaintiffs are regularly not allowed to file grievances challenging policies or \nprocedures and Defendants do not provide an alternative administrative mechanism to exhaust \nthe claims set forth in this Complaint. \n  37.  A grievance cannot be instituted except through a written form and Defendants \nand their agents consistently fail to ensure that Plaintiffs are provided with the grievance forms, \n  8 \n    \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 9 of 15    Pg ID 9\n   \n \nroutinely refuse to process grievances, and regularly fail to ensure responses to grievances, \nrendering administrative process for Plaintiffs unavailable or futile. \n  38.  Defendants, by policy and practice, have created barriers to the grievance system \nrendering the administrative process effectively unavailable to Plaintiffs. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS RELATIVE TO  \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS AND CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n \nA.  Plaintiff Amira Salem \n \n  39.  Plaintiff Amira Salem is currently a prisoner at Huron Valley. \n  40.  Commencing in 2009 and continuing until late 2010 and early 2011, Plaintiff was \nsubjected to spread-labia searches where she was ordered to get completely naked, sit in an \nunsanitized chair, open her legs wide, and manually open her labia to allow correctional officers \nto peer into her vagina. \n  41.  Plaintiff Salem is Muslim and her religion prohibits women from exposing their \ngenitalia in the manner required by the spread-labia search.  \n42  As a direct result of the unlawful search, Plaintiff Salem has suffered from anxiety \nattacks, flashbacks of sexual abuse, psychological and mental distress.  She has avoided and thus \nbeen deprived of family and religious visitations due to the humiliation, degradation, shame, \ndisgust and physical and mental abuse the spread-labia procedure causes after each visit. \nB.  Plaintiff Keshuna Abcumby \n43.  Plaintiff Keshuna Abcumby is currently a prisoner at Huron Valley. \n44.  Commencing in 2009 and continuing until 2011, Plaintiff Abcumby was \nsubjected to spread-labia searches where she was ordered to get completely naked, sit in an \nunsanitized chair, open her legs wide, and manually open her labia to allow correctional officers \nto peer into her vagina.  \n45.  On some occasions, Plaintiff Abcumby was required to sit in the chair naked, and \n  9 \n   \n\n2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   Doc # 1   Filed 11/01/13   Pg 10 of 15    Pg ID 10\n   \n \nhold her knees up and cough, as if pushing to deliver a baby. \n46.  On some occasions, a pink disinfectant spray was made available to spray on the \nchair, but was not allowed the sufficient time required by the product label to work effectively \nbefore Plaintiff was required to sit on the chair. \n47.  As a direct result of the unlawful searches, Plaintiff Abcumby suffered several \nvaginal bacteria infections, anxiety attacks, flashbacks of sexual abuse, nightmare, night sweats, \nnausea, vomiting, abnormal menstrual cycles, headaches, high blood pressure, and psychological \nand mental distress.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n§1983 – 8th Amendment \n \n  48.

Borman \nUnited States District Judge \nMICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF \nCORRECTIONS, ET AL., \nDefendants. \nI \n-------------------------\nOPINION AND ORDER \nDENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WITHOUT PREJUDICE \nCECFNO. 44) \nNow before the Court is Plaintiffs Amira Salem and Keshuna Abcumby's Motion for \nClass Certification that was filed on August 11, 2016.  (ECF No. 44.)  Defendants Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections (\"MDOC\") and Millicent Warren filed a response and Plaintiffs \nthereafter filed a reply.  (ECF Nos. 50 & 51.)1 \n1 After this Court's previous Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part \nDefendants' motion to dismiss and for summary judgment and the Sixth Circuit's remand in this \ncase, the only claims remaining against Defendants Daniel Heyns, Thomas Finco, Randy \nTreacher, Dennis Straub are official capacity claims for prospective relief.  See Salem v. MDOC, \nNo. 13-14567,2015 WL 1966727, at *8 (E.D. Mich. May 1, 2015) (available on the docket at \nECF No. 21); Salem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., 643 F. App'x 526 (6th Cir. 2016).  The Court \nnotes that both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' current briefing assumes, with no discussion, that all \nthe individual Defendants, save Defendant Millicent Warren, are no longer parties to this case. \nThe Court, however, recognizes that \"a suit against an individual in his official capacity is the \nequivalent of a suit against the government entity.\"  Goodwin v. Cnty. ofS ummit, Ohio, 45 F. \nSupp.3d 692, 699-700 (N.D. Ohio, 2014) (citing Will v. Mich. Dep 't ofS tate Police, 491 U.S. 58, \n71 (1985)); see also  Kraemer v. Luttrell, 189 F. App'x 361, 366 (6th Cir. 2006) (finding that \n\"suing a municipal officer in his official capacity for a constitutional violation pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 is the same as suing the municipality itself.\")  Accordingly, the Court agrees that \n\nA hearing on this matter was originally scheduled for Thursday, October 27, 2016.  On \nOctober 24, 2016, the Court issued an order directing Defendants to file a sur-reply addressing \nthe new proposed class definition that Plaintiffs raised for the first time in their reply brief.  (ECF \nNo. 52.)  Defendants filed their sur-reply on November 1, 2016.  (ECF No. 53.)  A hearing on \nthis matter was held on November 16, 2016.  For the following reasons, the Court will DENY \nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification at this time. \nI. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE \nOn November 1, 2013, Plaintiffs filed the instant putative class action pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of all female prisoners who \"since October 2010, have been, are now, or \nwill be hereafter incarcerated by [the Women's] Huron Valley Correctional Facility and who \nhave been subject to sexual harassment and degrading and unhygienic treatment by MDOC \ncustodial staff.\"  (Compl. ~ 16).  Plaintiffs alleged violations of their Fourth, Fourteenth and \nEighth Amendment rights and named six defendants in their action: Michigan Department of \nCorrections, Daniel Heyns, Thomas Finco, Randy Treacher, Dennis Straub, and Millicent Warren \n(collectively \"Defendants\"). \nPrior to 2009, a standard strip search at a correctional facility that housed female \nprisoners in Michigan was conducted by female correction officers who would require the \nprisoner to remove all her clothing, bend forward and spread her buttocks to allow for a visual \ninspection of the vagina and rectal cavity.  Then, in 2009, Defendant MDOC consolidated all of \nthe official capacity claims remaining against Defendants Heyns, Finco, Straub, and Treacher are \nmerely duplicative of Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief against the MDOC and will therefore \nformally dismiss those claims.  Goodwin, 45 F. Supp.3d at 700 (holding that \"when a civil rights \ncomplaint asserts a claim against a municipal entity and a municipal official in his or her official \ncapacity, federal courts will dismiss the official-capacity claim.\") \n2 \n\nits female prisoners into one facility, the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility (\"WHV\"). \nAt that time, Defendant Warren became the warden for the entire facility and the \"chair portion\" \nof the strip search was added to the above described standard strip search procedure.  Plaintiffs \nallege that the \"chair portion\" of the strip search procedure required that a female prisoner was \nforced to sit on a chair, open her knees, and spread her labia to expose her vaginal cavity for \ninspection by correction officers.  (Compl., at~ 25.)  Plaintiffs contend that the communal chairs \non which they were required to sit were \"unwashed and unsantizied,\" were not lined with \nsanitary paper, and were \"wet with bodily fluids from other prisoners.\"  (/d.)  Plaintiffs further \nclaim that female prisoners who suffered from communicable diseases such as \"HIV, AIDS, \ntuberculosis, hepatitis C, sexually transmitted diseases, and other vaginal infections\" were all \nsubject to the chair portion of the strip searches while on their menstrual cycles which resulted in \nblood being left on the communal chairs used during the strip searches.  (/d., at ~ 26.)  Plaintiffs \nalso allege that the chair portion of the search were conducted on \"numerous female prisoners in \nfull view of' other female prisoners.  (/d., at~ 19.)  This type of strip search was required after \nevery visit in which a prisoner was allowed physical contact with a visitor or was taken to any off \nsite location.  (/d., at ~ 27.) \nOn January 21, 2014, Defendants filed a \"Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment \nbased upon Qualified Immunity.\"  (ECF No. 11.)  After briefing and a hearing, the Court issued \nan Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part Defendants' motion to dismiss and for \nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity.2  See Salem v. MDOC, No. 13-14567,2015 WL \n2 This Court evaluated the motion under the standard for summary judgment as both sides \nrelied upon affidavits and materials outside the pleadings. \n3 \n\n1966727 (E.D. Mich. May 1, 2015) (available on the docket at ECF No. 21.)  Defendants \nappealed the Court's Opinion and Order.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit succinctly summarized this Court's Opinion and Order: \nThe district court agreed that the Eleventh Amendment barred Plaintiffs' \nmonetary claims against the MDOC and the named defendants in their official \ncapacities. It also found Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim abandoned and \ntheir Eighth Amendment claim insufficiently established. The court then \ndismissed the Fourth Amendment, unreasonable-search claim against all the \ndefendants except Warren because Plaintiffs \"failed to differentiate [their] \nindividual conduct.\"  Finding adequate the individual-conduct allegations against \nWarren, the court then denied Warren qualified immunity, holding that \"Plaintiffs \nhave identified a ... well established right to be free from a strip search that was \nperformed in full view of other prisoners.\"  Finally, the court denied summary \njudgment on the claim for prospective injunctive relief, finding that the allegedly \nongoing nature of the searches overcame Defendants' mootness argument. \nSalem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., 643 F. App'x 526, 529 (6th Cir. 2016) (available on the docket \nat 31). \nOn March 9, 2016, the Sixth Circuit affirmed this Court's denial of qualified immunity as \nto Defendant Warren.  ld., at 529-531.  The Sixth Circuit rejected Defendant Warren's argument \non appeal that she was not personally involved in any of the alleged constitutionally offensive \nsearches, because she failed to raise the argument in her motion for summary judgment. ld., at \n530.  The Sixth Circuit then went on to \"confine\" its inquiry as to \"whether the searches, \nperformed in the manner alleged by Plaintiffs, violated their clearly established Fourth \nAmendment rights.\" Jd.  The Sixth Circuit concluded \"that viewing the facts in a the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, we uphold the judgment of the district court denying qualified immunity \nto Warren regarding the non-private searches.\" ld., at 531. \nThe Sixth Circuit also held that it lacked jurisdiction to address Defendants' appeal from \n4 \n\nthis Court's finding that the claim for injunctive relief could proceed against the Defendants. \nThe Sixth Circuit explained that while Defendants argued in their appeal that sovereign \nimmunity barred Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief against Defendants based upon Papasan v. \nAllain, 478 U.S. 265 (1986), \"the Defendants never invoked sovereign immunity as to this claim. \nInstead they relied on the Prison Litigation Reform Act in pressing for summary judgment on \nmootness grounds.\" !d. at 531. \nThe mandate issued on March 31,2016.  (ECF No. 33.)  Thereafter, Defendants filed an \nAnswer to the Complaint and the parties submitted a discovery plan.  (See ECF No. 37, 39.) \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n\"A district court has broad discretion to decide whether to certify a class.\"  In re \nWhirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation, 722 F.3d 838, 850 (6th \nCir. 2013) (citation omitted); see also In reAm. Med. Sys., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996). \nA district court has such substantial discretion because \"it possesses the inherent power to \nmanage and control its own pending litigation.\"  Rikos v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 799 F.3d 497 \n(6th Cir. 20.15) (quoting Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 559 (6th Cir. 2007).  \"The \nclass action is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by an on behalf of the \nindividual named parties only.\"'  Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 537 (6th Cir. \n2012) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,--- U.S.---, 131 S.Ct. 2541,2550 (2011)). \nCritically, \"Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking class \ncertification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule-that is, he must be \nprepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law \nor fact, etc.\"  Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2551 (emphasis in original); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, ---\n5 \n\nU.S.---, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013).  The party seeking certification bears the burden in \nshowing all prerequisites under Rule 23 are satisfied.  In reAm. Med Sys., 75 F.3d at 1079. \nWhen reviewing a plaintiffs motion for class certification, the district court must conduct \na \"rigorous analysis\" of the Rule 23 requirements.  Corneas!, 133 S.Ct. at 1432 (citation omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that this \"rigorous analysis\" will frequently involve some \n\"overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim.\" /d.  To obtain class certification \npursuant to Rule 23 \"the plaintiffs must show that ' ( 1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; \nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" In \nre Whirlpool, 722 F.3d at 850 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)).  \"These four requirements \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation-serve to limit class claims to \nthose that are fairly encompassed within the claims of the named plaintiffs because class \nrepresentatives must share the same interests and injury as the class members.  /d. at 850-51 \n(citing Wal-mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2550). \nIn addition to meeting the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the proposed class must meet \nat least one of the three requirements set forth in Rule 23(b).  Wal-mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2548 \n(20 11 ).  In the present action, Plaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b )(3), which \nrequires that the \"questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available \nmethods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\"  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3). \nPlaintiffs bear the burden to show that all of the class certification prerequisites have been met. \n6 \n\nIn re Whirlpool, 722 F.3d at 851 (citation omitted). \nIII. ANALYSIS \nA.  Class Definitions \n\"[B]efore a court may certify a class pursuant to Rule 23, 'the class definition must be \nsufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a \nparticular individual is a member of the proposed class.\"' Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., \n693 F.3d 532, 537-38 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted); Newberg on Class Actions§ 3:3 (5th \ned.) (\"Courts generally treat the requirement [of definiteness] as a precursor to Rule 23 and \ntherefore examine the implicit requirements before proceeding the Rule's explicit \nrequirements.\")  In evaluating the \"ascertainability\" of a class, the Sixth Circuit has indicated that \nclass definitions which are \"amorphous\" or \"imprecise\" do not meet this standard.  !d. at 537-38 \n(citation omitted).  Further, \n[f Jor a class to be sufficiently defined, the court must be able to resolve the \nquestion of whether class members are included or excluded from the class by \nreference to objective criteria.  In some circumstances, a reference to damages or \ninjuries caused by particular wrongful actions taken by the defendants will be \nsufficiently objective for proper inclusion in a class definition. \nJd, at 538-39 (citation omitted); Newberg on Class Action§ 3.1 (5th ed.) (\"Despite the \nspecificity of Rule 23, courts have grafted on to it two additional criteria, often referred to as the \n'implicit requirements' of class certification: that the class be 'definite' or 'ascertainable' and \nthat the class representative be a member of the class.\"). \nIn their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs initially sought certification for the \nfollowing class of individuals: \"Current and future female prisoners who, since October 2010, \nhave been incarcerated at the Women's Valley Correctional Facility, and subject to sexual and \n7 \n\nphysical assault and abuse, sexual harassment, and degrading sexually humiliating and \nunhygienic treatment at the hands of Huron Valley correctional officers and staff.\"  (Pis.' Mot., at \n~ 1, see also Comp l.)  Then, apparently conceding Defendants' arguments regarding the proposed \nclass's lack of ascertainablity, Plaintiffs proposed a new and more narrow class definition in their \nreply brief: \"current and former women incarcerated at WHVCF since 2010 who were eligible \nfor offsite trips and contact visits and were thus, pursuant to the practice ofWHVCF, subject to \nthe 'chair portion' of Defendants' strip searches.\"  (Pis.' Reply, at 2.)  Plaintiffs went on to define \nthe \"chair portion\" of the strip search as \"forcing inmates to sit on un-sanitized chairs without \nwiping off the previous women's bodily fluids, forcing the inmates to use their unwashed hands \nto spread their genitals for visual inspection, forcing the inmates to then use their unwashed \nhands to touch their mouths, having the women 'spread labia' while menstruating, and having the \nwomen 'spread labia' in view of other prisoners after every visit in which a prisoner was allowed \nphysical contact with her visors or went on any off-site trip.\"  (!d. at 2-3.)  Plaintiffs argued in \ntheir reply that the more narrow class definition neutralized Defendants' arguments regarding \nascertainability and noted that the class could be ascertained from objective criteria - grievances \nfiled by female inmates regarding the strip search practices at WHV.3 \nIn light of Plaintiffs' new proposed class definition, this Court ordered supplemental \nbriefing from the Defendants.  (See ECF Nos. 52 & 53.)  Yet, the Court now declines to address \nthe first two proposed class definitions because during oral argument Plaintiffs proposed a third \n3 The Court notes that Plaintiffs' second proposed class includes potential members who \nwere \"eligible\" for offsite trips and contact visits but who may not have actually had any contact \nvisits or gone on an offsite trip.  Accordingly, as defined, Plaintiffs' second proposed class \ndefinition includes women who never were subject to the search at issue and making the class too \nbroad. \n8 \n\nclass definition that consisted of two subclasses: The first subclass would consist of any women \nwho are currently, or have formerly been, incarcerated at the Women's Huron Valley \nCorrectional Facility who were subject to the \"chair portion\" of the strip search in view of others \nbetween November 1, 2010 and November 1, 2013, and who have alleged to have suffered a \ncompensable injury as a result of the search.  Plaintiffs then proposed a second subclass defined \nas any women who are currently or have formerly been incarcerated at the Women's Huron \nValley Correctional Facility who were subject to the chair portion of the strip search between \nNovember 1, 2010 and December 16, 2011, who alleged that the search was performed in \nunsanitary or unhygienic conditions and who also suffered a compensable injury arising from that \nsearch. \nAs an initial matter, as discussed during the hearing and conceded by Plaintiffs' attorney, \nthe Sixth Circuit's decision affirmed this Court's holding that Defendant Warren was not \nprotected by qualified immunity to the extent that the subject searches were performed in full \nview of other female prisoners.  See Salem v. Michigan Dep't ofCorr., 643 F. App'x 526, 531(6th \nCir. 20 16) {\"Thus, viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, we uphold the \njudgment of the district court denying qualified immunity to Warren regarding the non-private \nsearches.\").  Plaintiffs' proposed second subclass defines a strip search that does not include any \nallegation regarding \"non private\" strip searches and in fact appears to be a subclass designed to \ncapture those potential class members who were not searched in full view of other female \nprisoners.  Accordingly, the Court finds this subclass definition is outside the scope of this action \nafter the Sixth Circuit's remand affirming the denial of qualified immunity as to Defendant \nWarren in this regard.  Thus, the only relevant portion of the third proposed class definition is the \n9 \n\nfirst subclass as defined by Plaintiffs: Any women who are currently, or have formerly been, \nincarcerated at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility who were subject to the \"chair \nportion\" of the strip search in view of others between November 1, 2010 and November 1, 2013, \nand who allege they have suffered a compensable injury as a result of the search. \nPlaintiffs' new third proposed class definition negates Defendants' earlier arguments in \nits response and sur-reply regarding potential over-breadth because the new definition narrows \nthe proposed class to women who suffered compensable injuries related to the \"chair portion\" of \nthe strip search in full view of others during a discrete time frame.  The Court also rejects \nDefendants earlier argument that Plaintiffs' proposed class definition constitutes an improper \nfail-safe class.  As explained by the Sixth Circuit, \"a 'fail-safe' class is one that includes only \nthose who are entitled to relief.  Such a class is prohibited because it would allow putative class \nmembers to seek a remedy but not be bound by an adverse judgment-either those 'class \nmembers win or, by virtue of losing, they are not in the class' and are not bound.\" !d. (citation \nomitted); see also Schilling v.  Kenton Cnty., Ky., No. 10-142-DLB, 2011 WL 293759, at *5 (E.D. \nKy. Jan. 27, 2011) (\"The class definition should avoid subjective standards such as the plaintiffs \nstate of mind or terms that depend on a merits adjudication.  A class definition is therefore too \ngeneral where it requires the Court to determine whether an individual's constitutional rights \nhave been violated in order to ascertain membership in the class itself.\")  Defendants reasoned in \ntheir sur-reply that  \"liability must be determined before the class member can be part of the class \nbecause it is not simply that the class member was subjected to the chair-based strip search which \ncreates liability, it is whether that prisoner was subjected to a search without a properly-sanitized \nchair, or not provided with a disposable seat cover, or the search was conducted in view of other \n10 \n\nprisoners.\"  (Defs.' Sur-reply, at 8-9.)  Here, Plaintiffs have proposed a third class definition that \nincludes all the women who were subject to the pattern or practice of the \"chair portion\" of the \nstrip search during pertinent time period.  Unlike a fail safe class, this definition does not depend \nupon a merits adjudication or include any subjective standards.  Defendants' argument appears to \nbe that the Court would have to make individual inquiries regarding the manner of the search to \ndetermine the constitutional validity of each strip search claim, however, this argument an \nargument that the Plaintiffs' claims lack commonality, not that the definition constitutes an \nimpermissible fail safe class or is unascertainable. \nIn summary, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' third proposed class definition is \nascertainable and can be determined based on objective criteria such as exhausted grievances. \nDespite having an ascertainable class, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification must be denied at this time for the reasons examined below. \nB.  Numerosity \nPursuant to Rule 23(a)(1), the numerosity requirement is satisfied when \"the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members [of the class] is impracticable.\"  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1). \nIn its initial motion for class certification Plaintiffs represented that there were 700 or more \npotential class members.  In their reply brief, which proposed a second, more narrow definition, \nPlaintiffs represented that there were \"11 0 potential class members who have exhausted the \ninternal grievance policy of the MDOC regarding the 'chair portion' of Defendants' strip search.\" \n(Pis.' Reply, at 5).  It was unclear at the hearing if the third proposed class definition affected the \npotential class members - especially in light of a proposed second subclass that applied to \nsearches that are outside the scope of this action.  The Court finds the lack of clarity and \n11 \n\nconsistency on this issue telling.  While a plaintiff need not know an exact figure to meet the \nnumerosity requirement, Plaintiffs must \"demonstrate that the number of potential class members \nis large.\"  In re Consumers Power Co. Sec. Litig., I05 F.R.D. 583, 60I (E.D. Mich. I985).  Here, \nPlaintiffs' initially represented a number of 700 potential members and then in their response \nbriefing Plaintiffs represented a potential call of II 0.  Plaintiffs did not provide any particular \nbasis, rationale, or evidence in support of their representation that there are II 0 potential class \nmembers, and during oral argument Plaintiffs' counsel noted that they have not yet received the \npertinent grievances in discovery.  Indeed, it is completely unclear how many of the potential \nmembers will fall within the new third proposed class definition addressed above and how many \nwere part of the second inapplicable subclass addressed supra. \nGiven the complete lack of clarity on this issue, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not \nmet the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) at this time. \nC.  Adequacy and Typicality \nThe Court also finds that Plaintiffs may not be adequate class representatives and their \nclaims may not be typical of those of the proposed class as required by Rule 23(a).  Pursuant to \nRule 23(a)(4), the court must find that the \"representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.\"  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4).  The Sixth Circuit has held that there \nare two criteria for determining the adequacy of representation: \"I) the representative must have \ncommon interests with unnamed members of the class; 2) it must appear that the representatives \nwill vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.\" In re Am. Me d. \nSys. Inc., 75 F.3d at I083 (quoting Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 51 I, 525 (6th Cir. \nI976)).  The typicality test in Rule 23(a)(3) \"'limit[s] the class claims to those fairly \nI2 \n\nencompassed by the named plaintiffs claims.\"' Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F.3d \n388, 399 (6th Cir. 1998) (alteration in Sprague, citation omitted).  \"A necessary consequence of \nthe typicality requirement is that the representative's interests will be aligned with those of the \nrepresented group, and in pursuing his own claims, the named plaintiff will also advance the \ninterests of the class members.\"  Young, 693 F.3d at 542 (citation omitted). \nHere, the named Plaintiffs allege that they were subject to the same \"chair portion\" of the \nstrip search by Defendants as the rest of the proposed class and thus share a common and typical \ninjury and interest with those proposed class members.  However, as noted above, \"Rule 23 does \nnot set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking class certification must affirmatively \ndemonstrate his compliance with the Rule - that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in \nfact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.\"  Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct. at \n2551 (emphasis in original). \nIn the present case, Plaintiff Abcumby provided in her affidavit that she was subject to the \n\"chair portion of the strip search\" in full view of others.  Yet, Plaintiff Salem has not alleged in \nthe complaint or in her affidavit that she was subject to the \"chair portion of the strip search\" in \nview of other people.  (See ECF No. 17, Ex. 4, Salem Aff.; ECF No. 19, Salem Am. Aff.)  Thus, \nPlaintiff Salem does not fall within Plaintiffs' third proposed class definition and her claim is not \ntypical of the class. \nAdditionally, Defendants have raised substantive and non-frivolous concerns regarding \nexhaustion of grievances.  It is unclear from the complaint, affidavits, and briefing whether the \nnamed representative Plaintiffs have exhausted their claims as required by the Prison Litigation \nReform Act.  See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007) (holding that \"[t]here is no question \n13 \n\nthat exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in \ncourt.\").  The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs have no duty to plead exhaustion.  See Surles v. \nAndison, 678 F.3d 452, 455-56 (6th Cir. 2012) (\"A PLRA defendant bears the burden of proving \nthat a PLRA plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies.\").  Yet, in the present case \nthere are real concerns over whether either named Plaintiff exhausted their grievances.  (See \nCompl., ~~ 35-38, alleging that Plaintiffs \"are regularly not allowed to file grievances challenging \npolicies or procedures and Defendants do not provide an alternative administrative mechanism to \nexhaust the claims set forth in this Complaint.\"). \nThus, the Court is faced with the unappealing prospect of certifying a class only to have \nboth named Plaintiffs later dismissed from the suit based on a failure to exhaust their claims.  See \nJohannes v.  Washington, No. 14-cv-11691, 2015 WL 5634446, at* 9-10 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 25, \n2015) (Michelson, J.) (declining to certify a class before addressing threshold issue of exhaustion \nbecause defendants raised \"non-trivial concerns about exhaustion\" and \"[o  ]therwise the Court \nrisks certifying a class only to later find that the claims of all six of the class representatives must \nbe dismissed, and, therefore, their claims are atypical and they are inadequate class \nrepresentatives.\").  These legitimate concerns lead the Court to conclude that Plaintiffs have not \nsatisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (4) and have not shown that the named Plaintiffs \nare adequate representatives of the potential class or that their claims are typical of the class. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that it would be imprudent to certify a class at this time. \nIn summary, the Court finds, after a \"rigorous analysis,\" that Plaintiffs have not carried \ntheir burden and shown that they satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a).  Specifically, the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have not shown that the potential class is sufficiently numerous to meet the \n14 \n\nstandard of Rule 23(a)(l).  Further, class certification at this time would be improper based on \nthe fact that the named Plaintiffs do not appear to be adequate representatives and either fall \noutside the proposed class definition or may not have claims typical to the class based on a \nfailure to exhaust their administrative remedies.  Because Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a)(J), (3) and (4), the Court need not reach the issue of commonality or \nwhether Plaintiffs' claims meet the standards of Rule 23(b). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor all these reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification \nwithout prejudice (ECF No. 44).  The Court also DISMISSES the official capacity claims against \nDefendants Daniel Heyns, Thomas Finco, Randy Treacher, Dennis Straub as duplicative. \nlT IS SO ORDERED. \nPAUL D. BORMAN \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nDEC  2 2 2016 \nDated: \n15 ",

The background of this litigation\nis set forth in detail in several previous opinions of this Court.  See Salem v. Mich.\nDept. of Corr., No. 13-14567, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14457 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 24,\n2018); Salem v. Dept. of Corr., No. 13-14567, 2016 WL 7409953 (E.D. Mich. Dec.\n22, 2016); Salem v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., No. 13-14567, 2015 WL 1966727 (E.D.\n1\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3956    Page 2 of 54\nMich. May 1, 2015).  The Sixth Circuit has also issued an opinion following the\nparties’ interlocutory cross-appeal of this Court’s May 1, 2015 Opinion and Order. \nSalem v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., 643 F. App’x 526 (6th Cir. 2016).  In summary, and as\nnarrowed by these decisions, the Plaintiffs are a putative class of inmates and former\ninmates of the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) female-only WHV,\nalleging that the WHV and then Warden Millicent Warren, in both her official and\nindividual capacities, violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by\nsubjecting them to mandatory routine strip searches, allegedly in full view of other\ninmates and individuals not necessary to the search, following off-site visits (including\nhospital visits or leaving the prison on a writ) and following all contact visits (i.e.\nvisits at the WHV in which a prisoner was allowed physical contact with her visitors).\n Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. (ECF\nNo. 66.)  Defendants filed a Response to the Motion (ECF No. 71), Plaintiffs filed a\nReply (ECF No. 73) and Defendants filed a Sur-Reply (ECF No. 84).  The Court has\ndetermined, pursuant to E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(f), that a hearing is not necessary and\ndecides the matter on the parties’ written submissions.  \n2\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3957    Page 3 of 54\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA. The Saga of Plaintiffs’ Multiple Last-Minute “Document Dumps”\nThis motion for class certification was filed on December 15, 2017, but has yet\nto be heard due to the prolonged inability of Plaintiffs’ counsel to properly submit\ncompetent evidence in support of their motion for class certification, as detailed\nbelow.  Before addressing the merits of the Plaintiffs’ long-pending motion for class\ncertification, the Court provides a brief but necessary explanation of the reason for the\ndelay: the ongoing saga of the Plaintiffs’ multiple affidavit “document dumps” and\none of Plaintiffs’ counsels’ sheer inability to comply with the Court’s numerous\nOrders regarding the insufficiency of their proposed “affidavit evidence.” To begin\nwith, attached to their Reply brief in support of their Motion for Class Certification,\nPlaintiffs  attached  approximately  840  pages  of  never-before-seen-or-referenced\nputative affidavits of current and former WHV inmates who claimed to have been\nsubject to non-private strip searches while incarcerated at the WHV.  (ECF No. 73-1.) \nThen, on the evening before the April 4, 2018 scheduled hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion\nfor Class Certification, Plaintiffs filed a “Supplement” to their Reply that attached an\nadditional seventy (70) pages of affidavits from additional putative class members\nclaiming to have been strip searched in front of others.  (ECF No. 75, Supplement to\nPlaintiffs’ Reply.)  Both sets of affidavits were sloppily presented with no tabbing or\n3\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3958    Page 4 of 54\nindexing and suffered from numerous significant procedural failings, including failure\nof signatures and proper notarization.  In addition, many of the affidavits were not\nfilled out at all and/or were duplicates.  On April 4, 2018, the morning of the hearing\non the motion for class certification, the Court issued an Order striking the Plaintiffs’\nsupplemental filing, more appropriately characterized as a last-minute completely\ndisorganized document dump, as inappropriate supplementation under E.D. Mich.\nL.R. 7.1(d).  (ECF No. 76, 04/04/18 Order Striking Supplements to Plaintiffs’\nReplies.)  Following discussion of the improperly filed affidavits at the April 4, 2018\nhearing, the Court canceled the hearing on the motion for class certification and issued\nanother Order striking the 840 pages of affidavits attached to Plaintiffs’ Reply brief\nand imposing sanctions against the Plaintiffs under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for unreasonably\nand vexatiously multiplying these proceedings.  (ECF No. 77, April 5, 2018 Order\nStriking Exhibits and Imposing Sanctions.)1  \n1   The Court did proceed on April 4, 2018, to hear argument on the parties’ motions\nfor summary judgment, which were scheduled to be heard simultaneously with the\nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  The Court issued its Opinion and Order on\nthe parties’ summary judgment motions on August 24, 2018.  The Court ultimately\ndetermined that it was not necessary to consider the Plaintiffs’ “affidavit evidence”\nfor purposes of resolving the parties’ motions for summary judgment.  (ECF No. 90,\nOpinion  and  Order  Denying  Defendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and\nQualified Immunity and Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.)\nNo interlocutory appeal was taken from the Court’s August 24, 2018 Opinion and\nOrder.  \n4\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3959    Page 5 of 54\nIn an effort to provide the Plaintiffs with every opportunity to present their\nclaim, the Court issued a second Order on April 5, 2018, allowing Plaintiffs two-\nweeks time to submit to the Court any putative affidavits they sought to have the\nCourt consider including “numbered pages, an index listing the name and page\nnumber for each individual affiant, tabbed pages separating each entry with the name\nof the individual affiant printed on the tab, and no duplicate entries.”  (ECF No. 78,\nApril 5, 2018 Order Requiring Additional Filings.)  The Court also Ordered a counsel\nfor  the  Plaintiffs  (Kenneth  Hardin)  to  file  an  Affidavit  or  Sworn  Declaration\nexplaining how the affidavits were created, describing how, where, and by whom the\naffidavits were signed and notarized, and otherwise detailing the process by which the\naffidavits were obtained and compiled.  (Id.)  The Court permitted the Defendants to\nfile a Sur-Reply up to seven (7) pages addressing the impact if any of the re-filed\naffidavits on their Response to the Plaintiffs’ motion.  (Id.) \nOn April 17 and 18, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the Hardin Affidavit along with the\nrevised affidavits of the putative class members.  (ECF Nos. 79, 80.)  Once again,\nincredibly, the Plaintiffs failed to submit the required information in an appropriate\nor organized format.  On August 1, 2018, the Court held a hearing to address the\ncontinued deficiencies in the Plaintiffs’ filings.  Following that hearing, the Court\ndetermined that Mr. Hardin’s Affidavit was improperly notarized in Pennsylvania and\n5\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3960    Page 6 of 54\nthat many of the re-submitted affidavits of the putative Michigan class members were\nincomplete and non-conforming, and that further sanctions were warranted.  That\nsame day, the Court issued another Order Striking Filings and Imposing Sanctions,\nstriking the Hardin Affidavit (ECF No. 79) and the “improper document dump of\nproposed affidavit exhibits” (ECF No. 80).  (ECF No. 86, 08/01/18 Order Striking\nFilings and Imposing Sanctions.)  In the 08/01/18 Order, the Court permitted Plaintiffs\nyet another final opportunity to re-file the putative class member affidavits, requiring\nsubmission on or before August 16, 2018.  (Id.)  On August 8, 2018, the Plaintiffs\nfiled  an  Emergency  Motion  seeking  additional  time  to  submit  the  affidavits,\nexplaining the difficulties Plaintiffs faced in attempting to obtain affidavits from\nputative class members who were still incarcerated, and seeking an additional thirty\n(30) days to re-file the affidavits. (ECF No. 88, Plaintiffs’ Uncontested Motion for\nOrder Amending the Court’s August 1, 2018 Order Striking Filings.)  The Defendants\ndid not oppose this motion, and the Court issued an Order on August 15, 2019,\ngranting the motion and permitting Plaintiffs to “properly file affidavit exhibits no\nlater than September 15, 2018.”  (ECF No. 89, 08/15/18 Order.)  \nOn September 14 and 15, 2018, as the Court had Ordered in its 08/15/18 Order,\nthe Plaintiffs refiled the Hardin Affidavit and the affidavits of 188 putative class\nmembers.  (ECF Nos. 91-94.)  On December 18, 2018, continuing to submit untimely\n6\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3961    Page 7 of 54\nnew and additional evidence (discovery closed in this case on September 28, 2017\nafter several extensions and the dispositive motion deadline was December 15, 2017,\nalso after several extensions had been granted), the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave\nof Court to File Additional Affidavits from 23 additional putative class members. \n(ECF No. 95.)   The Defendants filed a Response to the Plaintiffs’ motion on July 17,\n2019 (ECF No. 98), and the Plaintiffs filed a Reply on July 24, 2019 (ECF No. 99).\nThese 23 additional Affidavits are strikingly untimely and the motion to file them is\nDENIED.\nB. The Court’s Previous Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Original Motion to\nCertify Class Without Prejudice\nOn December 22, 2016, the Court issued an Order denying Plaintiffs’ original\nmotion for class certification without prejudice, finding inconsistencies between\nPlaintiffs’ evolving class definition and the Sixth Circuit’s ruling specifically defining\nthe touchstone of unconstitutionality in this action as the allegedly non-private nature\nof the searches. (ECF No. 56, December 22, 2016 Opinion and Order Denying\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification Without Prejudice 9-10, PgID 514-15.)  At\noral argument on the motion for class certification, Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged\nthat  the Sixth Circuit’s March 9, 2016 Opinion limited this action to claims of non-\nprivate searches, specifically stating that if in “going through the grievances, if it was\nnot specifically alleged to have been conducted in front of others, we would have no\n7\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3962    Page 8 of 54\nchoice but to voluntarily dismiss those potential claimants.”  (ECF No. 100, Transcript\nof November 16, 2016 Hearing 9:17-20) (hereinafter “11/16/16 Hr’g Tr.”)  Based on\nthe Sixth Circuit’s directive and counsel’s representations that inmate grievances\nwould be forthcoming, the Court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs’ third proposed\nclass of “women who suffered compensable injuries related to the chair portion of the\nsearch in full view of others during a discrete time frame” could potentially be\nascertained “based on objective criteria such as exhausted grievances.”  (ECF No. 56,\n12/22/16 Order Denying Class Certification 10-11, PgID 515-16.)  Despite finding\nthat the Plaintiffs had preliminarily demonstrated ascertainability based on their\nanticipated  review  of  grievances,  the  Court  concluded  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to\n“affirmatively demonstrate” the remaining Rule 23 factors as required under Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (“Rule 23 does not set forth a\nmere  pleading  standard.  A  party  seeking  class  certification  must  affirmatively\ndemonstrate his compliance with the Rule—that is, he must be prepared to prove that\nthere are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.”). \nThis Court was particularly troubled by the fact that named Plaintiff Salem had not\neven alleged in her Affidavit that her chair search was done in view of others and thus\nher claims were not typical of the class, and also by the “non-frivolous concerns\nregarding exhaustion of grievances” that the Defendants had raised regarding whether\n8\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3963    Page 9 of 54\nthe named Plaintiffs, not to mention the hundreds of proposed putative class members,\nhad fully exhausted their claims as required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e (“PLRA”).  (12/22/16 Order at 13-14, PgID 518-19.)  \nThe Court recognizes that Plaintiffs have no duty to plead exhaustion, and that\nDefendants bear the burden of establishing that Plaintiffs have not exhausted their\nremedies  through  the  grievance  procedure.    However,  given  the  fact  that  the\nDefendants both pleaded exhaustion as an affirmative defense and have strenuously\nargued failure to exhaust in their opposition to the motion for class certification, and\ngiven the Court’s obligation under Wal-Mart to conduct “a rigorous analysis” of the\nRule 23 factors, and to “probe behind pleadings,” which often “entail[s] some overlap\nwith the merits of plaintiff’s underlying claim,” the exhaustion issue is front and\ncenter in the class certification analysis in this case.  In fact, at the November 16, 2016\nhearing on the motion for class certification, counsel for the Plaintiffs expressly stated\non the record that “if [the named Plaintiffs] failed to exhaust, they would not be\neligible to participate.”  (11/16/16 Hr’g Tr. 11:11-12.)   As the Court observed in its\nOrder declining to certify a class, Plaintiffs’ request for class certification presented\nthe Court “with the unappealing prospect of certifying the class only to have both\nnamed Plaintiffs later dismissed from the suit based on a failure to exhaust their\nclaims.”  (12/22/16 Opinion and Order 14, PgID 519) (citing Johannes v. Washington,\n9\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3964    Page 10 of 54\nNo.  14-cv-11691,  2015  WL  5634446,  at  *9-10  (E.D.  Mich.  Sept.  25,  2015)\n(Michelson, J.)).  \nThree years on, it appears that the Court is still faced with this prospect because\nthere is no evidence in this record that either of the named Plaintiffs, or even any one\nof the 188 affiants, exhausted a grievance specifically complaining that they had been\nsubjected to the chair search procedure in the full view of others. While the Affidavits\nfinally filed by the Plaintiffs attempt to backfill the Plaintiffs’ claims with assertions\nthat they were searched utilizing the chair in view of numerous other people, the\nrecord in this case clearly demonstrates that the non-private nature of these searches\nwas never an issue that the Plaintiffs expressly grieved, complained of, or otherwise\nbrought to the attention of anyone at the MDOC. \nII. CERTIFICATION UNDER RULE 23\n“The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted\nby and on behalf of the individual named parties only.’” Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,\n569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013).  “To come within the exception, a party seeking to maintain\na class action ‘must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance’ with Rule 23.”  Id.\n(quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)).  “[T]hat is, he\nmust be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common\nquestions of law or fact, etc.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  “[C]ertification is proper only\n10\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3965    Page 11 of 54\nif the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule\n23(a) have been satisfied.”  Id. at 350-51 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).  The Court may not “presume” compliance with Rule 23’s requirements but\nmust satisfy itself through “rigorous analysis,” that necessarily “entails some overlap\nwith  the  merits  of  plaintiff’s  underlying  claim,”  that  there  has  been  “actual”\ncompliance.  Id. at 351.\nTo merit class certification, the Plaintiffs must show that, as required under Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(a), “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses\nof the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.”  In re Whirlpool Corp. Front Loading-Washer Pdcts. Liability\nLitig., 722 F.3d 838, 850 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)).  “These four\nrequirements—numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequate\nrepresentation—serve to limit class claims to those that are fairly encompassed within\nthe claims of the named plaintiffs because class representatives must share the same\ninterests and injury as the class members.”  Id. at 850 (citing Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at\n2550). “In addition to fulfilling the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the proposed class\nmust also meet at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).”  Id.  Where,\n11\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3966    Page 12 of 54\nas here, the Plaintiffs seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), the Plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate ‘that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members’ and that the class action is\n‘superior  to  other  available  methods’  to  adjudicate  the  controversy  fairly  and\nefficiently.” Id. at 850-51.  “The plaintiffs carry the burden to prove that the class\ncertification prerequisites are met, and the plaintiffs, as class representatives, [are]\nrequired to establish that they possess the same interest and suffered the same injury\nas the class members they seek to represent.”  Id. at 851 (internal citation omitted). \nA. Plaintiffs’  Proposed  Class  Definition  and  Plaintiffs’  Underlying\nClaim\nIn the December 22, 2016 Opinion and Order denying without prejudice\nPlaintiffs’  initial  class  certification  motion,  the  Court  addressed  the  following\nproposed plaintiff class:\nAny women who are currently, or have formerly been, incarcerated at the\nWomen's Huron Valley Correctional Facility who were subject to the\n“chair portion” of the strip search in view of others between November\n1, 2010 and November 1, 2013, and who allege they have suffered a\ncompensable injury as a result of the search.\n(Salem II at 9-10, Pg ID 514-15.) In the instant Motion for Class Certification,\nPlaintiffs propose a class definition identical to this definition, except that the relevant\ntime span is “from November 1, 2010 to the present.” (Pls.’ Mot. Class Cert. at 8, Pg\n12\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3967    Page 13 of 54\nID 722.) Plaintiffs also seek to add the following six subclasses to the putative class\ndefinition:\nAny women subject to search during 2009-2010 time period before\nWarden’s investigation of feasibility of chair-based strip search; any\nwomen subject to search and complaining that they were not given\ndisposable seat covers before the April, 2011 memorandum from the\nWarden; any women subject to search and complaining that they were\nnot given hand sanitizer before the April, 2011 memorandum from the\nWarden; any women subject to search and complaining that they were\nnot given disposable seat covers after the April, 2011 memo from the\nWarden; any women subject to search and complaining that they were\nnot given hand sanitizer after the April, 2011 memo from the Warden;\nand any women subject to search after December 14, 2011 to present\ntime period after chair-based strip search policy \"ended\" in writing.\n(Pls.’ Mot. Class Cert. at 8, Pg ID 722.) Notably, however, none of these proposed\nsubclasses are limited to individuals who were subject to strip searches in view of\nother inmates or persons without a legitimate penological need to be present. For that\nreason, these proposed sub-classes are outside the scope of this action, which (as\nemphasized above) has been limited by the Sixth Circuit to non-private strip searches.\n(See Salem, 643 F. App’x at 531) (“[V]iewing the facts in the light most favorable to\nPlaintiffs, we uphold the judgment of the district court denying qualified immunity to\nWarren regarding the non-private searches.”).) For that reason, this Court addresses\ncertification of the following class only:\nAny women who are currently, or have formerly been, incarcerated at the\n13\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3968    Page 14 of 54\nWomen's Huron Valley Correctional Facility who were subject to the\n“chair portion” of the strip search in view of others from November 1,\n2010 to the present, and who allege they have suffered a compensable\ninjury as a result of the search.\nThe Rule 23 inquiry, necessarily entwined as it is with the merits, must begin\nwith an understanding of the Plaintiffs’ underlying claim.  It is not possible to conduct\na “rigorous” examination of the requirements of adequacy, typicality, commonality,\nand predominance without reference to the elements of the underlying claims. While\nthe Complaint is a logical starting point in many instances, here six years of litigation\nand one round of appeal to the Sixth Circuit precedes this Court’s Rule 23 analysis,\nand so the Court addresses the claim as shaped by the course of these proceedings. \nIn any event, the Complaint provides no insight into the Plaintiffs’ only remaining\nclaim, captioned “Count II - § 1983 - 4th and 14th Amendment Due Process and\nPrivacy Violations,” which is pled in an entirely conclusory fashion, does not even\ndistinguish among the various named Defendants or specifically attribute any alleged\nconduct to any particular Defendant, and certainly does not separately allege a Monell2\nclaim. \nUnderstanding Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the underlying claim in this action\nis no easy task as Plaintiffs have failed to explain their theories of liability and have\n2   Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Serv. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).\n14\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3969    Page 15 of 54\nnever articulated the theory behind their Monell claims against the MDOC and the\nWarden in her official capacity in anything other than broad conclusory terms. \nAgainst the weight of the undisputed evidence that the WHV chair search Policy does\nnot authorize non-private searches, Plaintiffs rely directly on the chair search Policy\nand argue this as a blanket policy case, analogizing to several “strip search” cases in\nwhich courts have certified classes of prisoners (or former prisoners) who challenged\nblanket established institutional strip search policies applied in an across-the-board\nmanner to defined categories of inmates.  See, e.g., In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search\nCases,  461  F.3d  219  (2d  Cir.  2006)  (certifying  a  class  of  all  newly-admitted\nmisdemeanor detainees strip searched without reasonable suspicion pursuant to a\nblanket policy); Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)\n(certifying a class where the defendants “implemented a uniform, indiscriminate\npolicy of strip searching all detainees, in the absence of reasonable suspicion”);\nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D. 46 (D.D.C. 2008) (certifying a class of\narrestees who were subject to a blanket “drop, squat, and cough” search without\nindividualized reasonable suspicion); Calvin v. Sheriff of Will Cty., No. 03-C-3086,\n2004 WL 1125922 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2004) (finding commonality and certifying a\nstrip search class as to a blanket “no reasonable suspicion” strip search policy, that\nwas applied routinely to a defined class of arrestees, where “the ultimate legal\n15\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3970    Page 16 of 54\nquestion  is  not  whether  jail  personnel  made  erroneous  reasonable  suspicion\ndeterminations regarding each individual,” but rather whether the blanket policy,\nwhich did not require reasonable suspicion, unconstitutionally “avoided all such\ninquiry”); Eddelman v. Jefferson Cty. Ky., 96 F.3d 1448 (6th Cir. 1996) (unpublished)\n(finding that the fact that some searches were more or less intrusive did not defeat\ncommonality because the differences were not relevant where the plaintiffs claimed\nthat all searches without reasonable suspicion of those arrested for minor offenses was\nunconstitutional, regardless of whether the arrestee was forced to disrobe or whether\nthe search occurred in the presence of others). \nBut the chair search Policy does not authorize non-private searches, and yet\nPlaintiffs preface their motion for class certification with the statement that “[t]he strip\nsearch  procedure  was  a  policy  implemented  by  the  Michigan  Department  of\nCorrections.  As implemented policy, the strip search was not a matter to be addressed\nthrough the filing of grievances.”  (Pls.’ Mot. 8, PgID 722.)  Plaintiffs assert that\nseveral inmates were told that the chair search procedure was “policy” and could not\nbe grieved.  (Id.)  It is undisputed that the chair search procedure was Policy and the\ncontent of MDOC policies, as discussed infra, are not generally grievable except as\nspecifically applied to the prisoner.  However, there is no dispute that the chair search\nPolicy did not authorize non-private searches, and in fact demanded the opposite.  The\n16\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3971    Page 17 of 54\nPolicy Directives and WHV Operating Procedures governing “Search and Arrest in\nCorrectional Facilities” that were in effect before, during and after the time period\nrelevant to this case all required that strip searches be conducted only by employees\nof the “same sex” (with limited exceptions) and be “conducted in a place which\nprevents the search from being observed by those not assisting in that search” (again,\nwith limited exceptions).  (See ECF No. 11-2, PD 04.04.110 (eff. 02/01/09), PgID\n119; WHV OP 04.04.110 (eff. 05/01/2009), PgID 130; ECF No. 17-4, PD 04.04.110\n(eff. 04/09/2012), PgID 199.)  Plaintiffs have cited no provision of PD 04.04.110,\nWHV-OP-04.04.110,  or  any  other  formal  policy  or  directive  that  would  have\nauthorized officers to conduct strip-searches on inmates in the presence of other\ninmates or other individuals not necessary to the penological purposes of the search.\nThe touchstone of unconstitutionality that survived the Defendants’ appeal to\nthe Sixth Circuit is the claim that the chair strip searches were conducted in full view\nof other inmates or persons without a legitimate penological need to be present. The\nPlaintiffs have expressly acknowledged that this is the scope of the claim going\nforward in this case:\nMs. Miller: Your Honor, I believe that because the unconstitutional – the\nstandard that we were given from the Sixth Circuit is that it was done in\nview of others.  So in my view, no other claims would survive.  We’re\nstill in discovery. If we confined it to that definition while we’re going\nthrough the grievances, if it was not specifically alleged to have been\n17\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3972    Page 18 of 54\nconducted in front of others, we would have no choice but to voluntarily\ndismiss those potential claimants.\n(11/16/16 Hr’g Tr. 9:13-20.) (emphasis added).\n It is undisputed that the scope of this action is now limited to claims that\nPlaintiffs were subject to non-private chair strip searches, and there is no colorable\nargument that the chair search Policy authorized the chair strip searches to be\nconducted in view of others.  In fact the Policy directed a one-on-one, same-sex\nsearch.  Yet Plaintiffs repeatedly tether their Fourth Amendment claim to the Policy\nitself, insisting that they are relieved of any exhaustion requirement because the chair\nsearch was “Policy” and they were unable to grieve “Policy.” Plaintiffs insist in their\nmotion for class certification that “the filing of grievances cannot be a prerequisite to\nclass membership because the strip search procedure was policy and under MDOC’s\nown instruction, ‘not able to be grieved.’”  (Pls.’ Mot. 10, PgID 724.)  Plaintiffs argue,\nwithout citation to any authority, that therefore the Court should rely on the 188 after-\nthe-fact affidavits that they created for inmates to sign and simply excuse the fact that\nit appears that none of them, including the named Plaintiffs, grieved, much less fully\nexhausted, the issue of non-private chair searches at the time those searches occurred. \nBut  non-private  searches  were  never  Policy  and  such  intrusions  were  always\ngrievable. Yet Plaintiffs have not produced one fully exhausted grievance from any\n18\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3973    Page 19 of 54\ninmate, let alone from the named Plaintiffs, grieving this aspect of the search (or for\nthat matter any fully exhausted grievances period).\nPlaintiffs appear to recognize the weakness of their theory, arguing in their\nmotion for class certification that “exclud[ing] women from the class action solely\nbecause they did not expressly state that they were strip searched in front of others in\ntheir grievance is an undue burden to place upon these women who had just endured\na trauma and report limited reading and writing skills.”  (Pls.’ Mot. 10, PgID 724.) \nYet counsel for Plaintiffs previously stated in a hearing before this Court that if a\nproposed Plaintiff had not alleged in a grievance that she had been searched in front\nof others, Plaintiffs would have “no choice but to dismiss them from this action.” \n(11/16/16 Hr’g Tr. 9:19-20.)  But that was before counsel apparently discovered that\nnone of the proposed class members was sufficiently aggrieved by the presence of\nothers at the time of their searches to mention that affront in any grievance, or in any\nforum meeting with the Warden, or in any other manner contemporaneously with the\nsearches.  (See discussion infra.)  Only now, having been presented with check-box\naffidavits that present this specific query, do the proposed class members recall and\nreport that “others” were present.  \nThis non-private aspect of the search is the essence of the constitutional claim\nthat has survived in this case  – as Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded at the previous class\n19\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3974    Page 20 of 54\ncertification hearing, there is no Fourth Amendment claim without such an allegation. \nRegardless  of  how  Plaintiffs  attempt  to  characterize  their  claims,  the  Fourth\nAmendment violation they complain of was in fact always grievable.  Plaintiffs’\nattempt at revisionist history, trying to give extreme importance now to an issue that\nappears not to have merited mention by the inmates at the time of the actual events\nunder scrutiny, cannot change the nature of the Fourth Amendment claim that\nPlaintiffs must demonstrate. \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification offers no clarity at all on the nature of\ntheir claim. The brief speaks in vague generalities proclaiming that “the nature and\nextent of defendants’ unconstitutional practices are common to the named Plaintiffs\nand all proposed and potential class members,” with no amplification whatsoever\ndescribing those vague but common “practices.”  Plaintiffs acknowledge that “the\ncircumstances surrounding each class member’s chair portion of Defendants’ strip\nsearch procedure were not identical,” but simply conclude that nonetheless the\nPlaintiffs’ claims all “stem from the same alleged unconstitutional conduct.” (Pls.’\nMot. 17, PgID 731.)  \nAll that is missing here is everything. After six years of opportunity to discover\nevidence and develop theories of liability, there is no explanation or analysis of the\nalleged unconstitutional conduct that was “common to all” other than the blanket\n20\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3975    Page 21 of 54\nassertion that the all class members suffered from the same unconstitutional conduct,\ni.e., a chair search pursuant to the MDOC Policy, which it is undisputed did not\nauthorize the conduct of which the class complains.  “‘It is not sufficient for a party to\nmention a possible argument in a most skeletal way, leaving the court to put flesh on its\nbones.’” Bishop v. Gosiger, Inc., 692 F. Supp. 2d 762, 774 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (quoting\nMeridia Prods. Liab. Lit. v. Abbott Labs., 447 F.3d 861, 868 (6th Cir. 2006)). \n“‘[I]ssues averted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.’” Id. (quoting McPherson v. Kelsey,\n125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th Cir. 1997)). \n   Determining the Defendants’ liability as to each and every search will require\nindividualized proof regarding whether others were present and whether the presence\nof “others” was related to the penological purpose of the search. In addition, as\ndiscussed in detail infra, individualized inquiries regarding exhaustion also will\nrequire separate analysis as to each class member’s claim.   In short, “mini-trials” will\nbe required to determine whether, in any given instance, the circumstances of the\nsearch were such that Plaintiffs can assert a viable claim that Defendants violated their\nFourth Amendment rights.  As discussed supra, unlike a claim related to a blanket\npolicy that has been indisputably applied across-the-board to a defined group of\nindividuals, Plaintiffs’ claim relates to the manner in which individual searches were\n21\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3976    Page 22 of 54\ncarried out and whether they were carried out in violation of a governing Policy\nspecifying private searches.  In short, Plaintiffs’ underlying claim relates to numerous\nunrelated allegedly non-private searches that, if they occurred as alleged, may have\nviolated  WHV  Policy  and  could  and  should  have  been  grieved.    With  this\nunderstanding of Plaintiff’s underlying claim, the Court now turns to an analysis of\nthe Rule 23 factors, beginning with those that most clearly mandate denial of class\ncertification here.3\n3   As discussed supra, Plaintiffs have made no effort to develop any theory of Monell\nliability apart from their reliance on the chair search Policy itself.  And even then,\nPlaintiffs have never explained how the Policy itself supports their Monell claim.  In\narguing that the Warden was not entitled to qualified immunity, Plaintiffs alluded to\na claim based on a “policy of inaction,” citing Garretson  v. City of Madison Heights,\n407 F.3d 789, 796 (6th Cir. 2005). (ECF No. 67, Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ.\nJudg. and Qualified Immunity 17, PgID 788.)  There are several problems with this\nreference.  First, the discussion of a “policy of inaction” in Garretson to which the\nPlaintiffs cited was with respect to Garretson’s claim against the municipality, not the\nindividual officers, and thus Garretson was a completely inapt reference in the context\nof the Warden’s liability in her individual capacity and her entitlement to qualified\nimmunity. In referencing Garretson in this context, Plaintiffs conflate the concept of\nsupervisory liability of a policymaker in an individual capacity with a policy of\ninaction claim against a municipality.  See Essex v. Cty. of Livingston, 518 F. App’x\n351, 355-56 (6th Cir. 2013).  If Plaintiffs were suggesting some type of Monell claim\nagainst the MDOC and the Warden in her official capacity with this reference (even\nthough the issue before the Court was solely the Warden’s entitlement to qualified\nimmunity), they have made no effort to develop such a claim.  In fact, having elected\nto base their claims on the argument that the chair search Policy authorized the\nclaimed Fourth Amendment violations and that therefore the Policy could not be\ngrieved, they  cannot credibly turn around and argue that they are actually making a\nclaim that there was a custom or practice of violating the chair search Policy.  In any\nevent, there is no evidence in this fully-developed record that would support such a\n22\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3977    Page 23 of 54\nclaim.  In order to establish a “policy of inaction,” Plaintiffs must show:\n(1) a clear and persistent pattern of [non-private chair strip searches]; (2)\nnotice, or constructive notice of such pattern, to [the MDOC]; (3) tacit\napproval of the deliberate indifference and failure to act amounting to an\nofficial policy of inaction; and (4) that the custom or policy of inaction\nwas the “moving force,” or direct causal link, behind the constitutional\ninjury.\nGarretson, 407 F.3d at 796 (citing Doe v. Claiborne Cty., 103 F.3d 495, 508 (6th Cir.\n1996)). Here, after six years of litigation, as discussed at length in this Opinion and\nOrder, Plaintiffs have failed to submit competent evidence that the Warden or the\nWHV was made aware that there was a persistent pattern of inmates being chair strip\nsearched in view of other inmates or persons without a legitimate penological need\nto be present, let alone that there was official approval of and a failure to act in\nresponse to such a pattern.  While many aspects of the chair strip search were brought\nto the attention of the Warden (and were addressed) there is simply no evidence that\nthe inmates complained that the searches were being conducted in a non-private\nsetting.  In fact, the only contemporaneous partial grievances that have been submitted\nindicate that the search was conducted by a single corrections officer.  See ECF No.\n67-2, PgID 913-17, Partial Grievance of inmate DeBruin, complaining that she was\n“asked to strip and sit in a chair by officer Sharpe,” never mentioning the presence of\nanother individual and suggesting the presence of a single corrections officer; ECF\nNo. 67-2, Partial Grievance of inmate Radtke, complaining that she was “forced to\nperform a body cavity search in front of WHV officer,” which made her feel violated\nand humiliated, making no mention of the presence of the others and suggesting the\npresence of a single corrections officer.  After six years of litigating this case,\nPlaintiffs have failed to articulate or proffer evidence in support of any variant of a\ncustom or practice claim and it is not the Court’s job to hypothesize such a claim or\nsearch the record for evidence in support of such a claim. “[D]istrict courts cannot be\nexpected to dig through the record to find the seeds of a party’s cause of action.\nPlaintiff must mark each site, identifying the genuine disputes of fact that preclude\nsummary judgment on a particular claim.  The district court had no obligation to do\nplaintiff’s work for her, nor do we.”  Sumpter v. Wayne Cty., 868 F.3d 473,490 (6th\nCir. 2017).  Similarly, Plaintiffs’ completely conclusory one-sentence reference in\ntheir motion for class certification to a “failure to protect this vulnerable population\n23\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3978    Page 24 of 54\nB. Commonality, Typicality, Predominance\nTo obtain class certification, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that “the claims or\ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3), and that “the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). If Plaintiffs\nsatisfy these factors, and thereby satisfy all four prerequisites set forth in Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(a), they must then satisfy one of the three prongs of Rule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs\nproceed under Rule 23(b)(3), which allows a class action to be maintained if “the\ncourt finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is\nsuperior  to  other  available  methods  for  fairly  and  efficiently  adjudicating  the\ncontroversy.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(3).    “[T]he  commonality  and  typicality\nrequirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n. 5.  If the Court\nfinds a clear failure of proof on the issue of commonality, “it is unnecessary to resolve\nwhether  [Plaintiffs]  have  satisfied  the  typicality  and  adequate-representation\nrequirements of Rule 23(a).”  Id. \nby declining to supervise, train, monitor, discipline, regulate prison staff,” with zero\nanalysis of any element of any one of these types of Monell claims (Pls.’ Mot. 6, PgID\n720), is so lacking in substance after six years of litigation that it merits no analysis.\n“‘It is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in a most skeletal way,\nleaving the court to put flesh on its bones.’” Bishop, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 774. \n24\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3979    Page 25 of 54\n1. Individualized  inquiries  as  to  liability  preclude  class\ncertification.\nPlaintiffs’ claim that class members were searched pursuant to the chair search\nPolicy in view of others who were unnecessary to the penological purposes of the\nsearch, which in fact would be contrary to the chair strip search Policy, necessarily\nrequires  resolution  of  particularized  inquiries  regarding  each  individual  search. \nUnlike blanket strip search policy claims that do not rely on the particulars of any\nindividual search, Plaintiffs’ claims are not amenable to class treatment because they\ndo not present a “common contention . . . that is capable of classwide resolution –\nwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is\ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at\n350.  If Plaintiffs were claiming that a WHV policy authorized non-private searches,\nthat all class members were searched pursuant to that policy, and that the policy was\ninvalid on its face, resolution of the issue of the constitutionality of that policy\npossibly could determine “in one stroke” a central issue to those class claims.  But\nhere, the Policy prohibits the alleged unconstitutional conduct and thus the manner\nand degree of intrusiveness of each individual search will be central issues that cannot\nbe resolved “in one stroke.”  See, e.g., Gustafson v. Polk Cty., Wis., 226 F.R.D. 601,\n605-06 (W.D. Wis. 2005) (Crabb, C.J.) (finding that commonality requirement was\nnot met when the plaintiffs’ claims necessarily required “an examination of the extent\n25\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3980    Page 26 of 54\nof the intrusiveness of each class member’s strip search or the manner in which the\nsearches were conducted”); Klein v. DuPage Cty., 119 F.R.D. 29 (N.D. Ill. 1988) \n(declining to certify a class of inmates who complained that routine “strip-and-cavity\nsearches” conducted before and after court appearances and visitations where the\nreasonableness of each search was dependent upon “special institutional security\nconcerns” and where each search may have been conducted in a “variety of ways”). \n   It is undisputed that the Plaintiffs are claiming that the putative class members’\nFourth Amendment rights were violated on a number of different occasions, by a\nnumber of different individuals, under a number of different circumstances.  The\nAffidavits report the presence of various individuals (some by name, some not), and\nlist a number of dates on which the Plaintiffs and putative class members were\nsearched (some with specific dates, some with only years or ranges), and do not\nconnect the presence of any particular individual with any particular search date. \nMoreover, the Affiants purport to define which correctional officers were “necessary”\nto their particular searches by identifying individuals they deemed to be “unnecessary”\nparties who viewed their search and then indicating YES/NO whether “the only\nunnecessary party/parties identified above was/were Correctional Officer Trainees.”\nAgain, these responses are directed generally to the inmate’s identification of a group\nof “others” who were alleged to have been present without specification of which\n26\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3981    Page 27 of 54\nindividuals were present at and “unnecessary” for any particular search. This question\nseemed to confound many Affiants (as it does the Court) as several of the inmates\neither did not answer this question or scribbled out their original response and\nprovided a different response, likely because an inmate would have no basis for\ndetermining the penological necessity of others who may have been present during her\nsearch – especially when asked to recall the circumstances of the event many years\nafter the search occurred.    \nThe Defendants’ liability as to each and every search will require individualized\nproof regarding whether “others” were present and whether the presence of “others”\nwas related to the penological purpose of the search.  Here, the Policy prohibits the\nalleged unconstitutional conduct and thus the manner and degree of intrusiveness of\neach individual search will be central issues that cannot be resolved “in one stroke,”\ndefeating commonality.  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \n2. Individualized inquiries regarding exhaustion preclude class\ncertification.\nUnder the PLRA, a prisoner may not bring an action “with respect to prison\nconditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law ... until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). \nCongress enacted this provision to address the “outsized share” of prisoner litigation\n27\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3982    Page 28 of 54\nfilings and to ensure that “the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and\neffectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit.” Jones v. Bock, 549\nU.S. 199, 203 (2007). Put another way, the purpose of § 1997e(a) is to “reduce the\nquantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.” Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516,\n524 (2002).  In addition, exhaustion “gives an agency an opportunity to correct its\nown mistakes with respect to the programs it administers before it is haled into federal\ncourt, and it discourages disregard of [the agency’s] procedures.”  Woodford v. Ngo,\n548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n“There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that\nunexhausted claims cannot be brought into court.”  Jones, 549 U.S. at 211.  The\nprison’s grievance process determines when a prisoner has properly exhausted his or\nher claim.  Id. at 218 (“The level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the\ngrievance  procedures  will  vary  from  system  to  system,  but  it  is  the  prison’s\nrequirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.”). \nEven where a prisoner has made some attempts to go through the prison’s grievance\nprocess, “[t]he plain language of the statute makes exhaustion a precondition to filing\nan action in federal court.”  Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 645 (6th Cir. 1999). \nThe prisoner “may not exhaust his [or her] administrative remedies during the\npendency of the federal suit.” Id. (citations omitted); see also Woodford, 548 U.S. at\n28\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3983    Page 29 of 54\n95 (“A prisoner who does not want to participate in the prison grievance system will\nhave  little  incentive  to  comply  with  the  system’s  procedural  rules  unless\nnoncompliance carries a sanction....”). However, “inmates are not required to specially\nplead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.”  Jones, 549 U.S. at 216. \nInstead, failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense under the\nPLRA.  As such, Defendants bear the burden of proof on exhaustion.  Surles v.\nAndison, 678 F.3d 452, 456 (6th Cir. 2012) (“A PLRA defendant bears the burden of\nproving that a PLRA plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies.”).\na.    Grievance Procedures at the MDOC\nPursuant  to  its  Policy  Directive  03.02.130,  dated  July  9,  2007,  the\nadministrative remedies available at the MDOC are as follows. First, the prisoner must\nattempt to resolve any issue with the staff member involved within two business days\nof becoming aware of a grievable issue. (ECF No. 50-1, Policy Directive 03.02.130\n(eff. 07/09/2007) ¶ P, PgID 471-77.)  If the issues are not resolved within five\nbusiness days, the prisoner may file a Step I grievance using the appropriate form.\n(Id.)  “The issues should be stated briefly but concisely” and “[d]ates, times, places,\nand names of all those involved in the issue being grieved are to be included.”  (Id. ¶\nR.) The prisoner should receive a response within fifteen business days of filing the\ngrievance. (Id. ¶ X.)\n29\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3984    Page 30 of 54\nIf the prisoner is dissatisfied with the disposition of the grievance, or does not\nreceive a response by ten business days after the due date, he or she may file a Step\nII grievance using the appropriate form.  (Id. ¶ BB.)  As with Step I, a response to the\nStep II grievance should be issued within fifteen business days.  (Id. ¶ CC.)\nSimilarly, if the prisoner is dissatisfied with the Step II response or does not\nreceive a response by ten business days after the response was due, he or she may file\na Step III grievance.  (Id. ¶ FF.)  The matter is fully exhausted after the disposition of\nthe Step III grievance.  Surles, 678 F.3d at 455 (“A grievant must undertake all steps\nof the MDOC process for his grievance to be considered fully exhausted.”) (emphasis\nadded).\nb.    Exhaustion as an issue precluding class certification\nAs this Court recognized in December 2016 when denying Plaintiffs’ prior\nmotion for class certification without prejudice: \nDefendants have raised substantive and non-frivolous concerns regarding\nexhaustion of grievances.  It is unclear from the complaint, affidavits,\nand briefing whether the named representative Plaintiffs have exhausted\ntheir claims as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.  See Jones\nv. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007) (holding that “[t]here is no question\nthat exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted\nclaims  cannot  be  brought  in  court.”).    The  Court  recognizes  that\nPlaintiffs have no duty to plead exhaustion.  See Surles v. Andison, 678\nF.3d 452, 455-56 (6th Cir. 2012) (“A PLRA defendant bears the burden\nof proving that a PLRA plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative\n30\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3985    Page 31 of 54\nremedies.”).  Yet, in the present case there are real concerns over\nwhether either named Plaintiff exhausted their grievances.  (See Compl.,\n¶¶ 35-38, alleging that Plaintiffs “are regularly not allowed to file\ngrievances challenging policies or procedures and Defendants do not\nprovide an alternative administrative mechanism to exhaust the claims\nset forth in this Complaint.”).  \nThus, the Court is faced with the unappealing prospect of certifying a\nclass only to have both named Plaintiffs later dismissed from the suit\nbased on a failure to exhaust their claims.  See Johannes v. Washington,\nNo. 14-cv-11691, 2015 WL 5634446, at * 9-10 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 25,\n2015) (Michelson, J.) (declining to certify a class before addressing\nthreshold issue of exhaustion because defendants raised “non-trivial\nconcerns about exhaustion” and “[o]therwise the Court risks certifying\na  class  only  to  later  find  that  the  claims  of  all  six  of  the  class\nrepresentatives  must  be  dismissed,  and,  therefore,  their  claims  are\natypical  and  they  are  inadequate  class  representatives.”).    These\nlegitimate concerns lead the Court to conclude that Plaintiffs have not\nsatisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (4) and have not shown\nthat the named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the potential\nclass or that their claims are typical of the class.  Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that it would be imprudent to certify a class at this time.\n(12/22/16 Opinion and Order 13-14, PgID 518-19).\nThose same “substantive and non-frivolous concerns regarding exhaustion of\ngrievances” remain at issue here and similarly preclude certification.  Specifically,\ndespite  the  Court’s  ruling  above,  Plaintiffs  only  submitted  three  unexhausted\ngrievances with their instant motion for class certification, none of which belong to\nthe named Plaintiffs and all of which were rejected as untimely filed. (See ECF Nos.\n31\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3986    Page 32 of 54\n66-4, Wascher-McIntosh Griev., PgID 746-51, 66-5, Turner Griev., PgID 752-57, and\n66-6, Tanner Griev., PgID 758-63.)  See Scott v. Ambani, 577 F.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir.\n2009) (stating that a prisoner cannot satisfy the exhaustion requirement by filing an\nuntimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative grievance). Plaintiffs\notherwise failed to submit any exhausted grievance by the named Plaintiffs (or any\nputative class member) with their instant motion (although they did previously\nprovide grievance records for Abcumby which do not appear exhausted, as explained\nfurther below), and instead propose new criteria for ascertaining class membership –\nthe 188 affidavits by prisoners who swear that they were subjected to the chair strip\nsearch in view of others.  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs make only conclusory allegations regarding\nexhaustion, without citation to any evidence in the record, and that “Plaintiffs’ failure\nto produce even one exhausted claim of a potential class member calls into question\nwhether this action is suitable as a class action.”  (ECF No. 71, Defs’ Resp., PgID\n947-48, 950.)  The Court agrees that the unanswered issue of whether either of the\nnamed  Plaintiffs,  or  even  any  putative  class  member,  have  exhausted  their\nadministrative remedies regarding the sole remaining claim in this case – that they\nwere subjected to the chair strip search in view of other inmates or persons without\na legitimate penological need to be present – raises concerns regarding Plaintiffs’\n32\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3987    Page 33 of 54\nability to meet their burden to demonstrate that: (1) “the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class” (typicality)\n(Rule 23(a)(3)); (2) “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class” (adequacy) (Rule 23(a)(4)); and (3) “that the questions of law\nor fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members” (predominance) (Rule 23(b)(3)).\ni. Plaintiffs have failed to produce any exhausted grievances,\ndespite their unsupported assertions that the named Plaintiffs\nhave “exhaust[ed] their [administrative] remedies” and the\nmajority of putative class members’ attestations that they\nhave “completed the grievance process”\nAs explained above, “[t]here is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under\nthe PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought into court.”  Jones, 549 U.S.\nat 211.  Plaintiffs concede in their motion for class certification that they “have since\n[their prior motion for class certification] received grievances and other documents\nfrom the MDOC,” (Pls.’ Mot. 7, PgID 721), and Defendants confirm that Plaintiffs\n“hav[e] all of the relevant grievances.”  (ECF No. 71, Defs.’ Resp. 6, PgID 944).  \nPlaintiffs then unambiguously state that “both named Plaintiffs did exhaust their\nremedies by filing Step I-III grievances.”  (Pls.’ Mot. 18, PgID 732.)  However, they\nfail to attach those purported grievances to their motion (even though they do attach\n(unexhausted) grievance documents of three putative class members). The only\n33\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3988    Page 34 of 54\nevidence regarding Plaintiff Abcumby’s alleged administrative exhaustion in the\nrecord  is  six  pages  of  grievance  records  attached  to  Plaintiffs’  Response  to\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Qualified Immunity (ECF No. 67-2,\nPls.’ Resp. Opp’n Summ. J. Ex. 15, Abcumby Grievance Records, PgID 918-23), and\nwhile those documents may evidence that Plaintiff Abcumby initiated a grievance\nregarding the chair strip search procedure, they do not show that she exhausted the\nprocess. The record contains no grievance records for Plaintiff Salem at all, despite\nher uncorroborated statement in her February 9, 2014 affidavit that she “filed a\ngrievance on September 4, 2011” regarding “utilizing the chair in the strip search.” \n(ECF No. 17-5, Pls.’ Resp. Opp’n MTD, Ex. 4, PgID 211.)  \nIn addition, the overwhelming majority of the affidavits supplied by Plaintiffs\nat the time they filed their reply brief similarly assert in a check-box fashion that the\naffiants “did complete the grievance process regarding the search(es).”  (ECF Nos. 92,\n93, 94.)  However, again, Plaintiffs fail to supply even one of those “complete[d]”\ngrievances in support of their motion for class certification.\nWhile recognizing that it is Defendants’ burden to prove failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies, the exhaustion issue nevertheless impacts Plaintiffs’ ability\nto demonstrate that they are adequate class representatives and that their claims and\ndefenses are typical of those of the class members, and raises concerns about the\n34\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3989    Page 35 of 54\npotential for individualized factual and legal issues predominating over class-wide\nissues.\nii. The grievances that have been supplied fail to complain\nabout the “non-private” nature of the searches\nOf the few unexhausted grievances Plaintiffs have provided to the Court, no\ngrievance contains allegations stating or inferring that other inmates or other persons\n“not assisting in that search” were in the room or otherwise complains about the “non-\nprivate” nature of the prisoner’s search.  Rather, these grievances complain only about\nbeing subjected to the “spread labia” chair search, which they found “humiliating” and\n“degrading.”  (See Wascher-McIntosh Griev., PgID 747; Turner Griev., PgID 757;\nTanner Griev., PgID 763; see also Radtke, Williams, deBruin, and Abcumby Grievs.,\nPgID 901-23.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that the grievances submitted cannot be expected to contain\n“every allegation of misconduct that occurred within the strip search procedure.” \n(Pls.’ Mot.9, PgID 723.)  But the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to provide\n“fair notice of … alleged mistreatment or misconduct that forms the basis of the\nconstitutional or statutory claim made against a defendant in a prisoner’s complaint.” \nBell v. Konteh, 450 F.3d 651, 654 (6th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks and citation\nomitted), abrogated on other grounds by Jones, 549 U.S. at 219.  Therefore, “[a]n\n35\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3990    Page 36 of 54\ninmate’s grievance must give ‘sufficient notice of the matter being grieved …,’ so that\n‘[p]rison officials … ha[ve] a chance to provide a remedy for the inmate and to decide\nwhether the objectives of the review process have been served.’”  Rivers v.

Edelman, 851 F.3d 583, 591 (6th Cir. 2017) (“We have also explained that the\npurpose of the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement ‘is to allow prison officials a fair\nopportunity to address grievances on the merits, to correct prison errors that can and\nshould be corrected and to create an administrative record for those disputes that\neventually end up in court.’”) (quoting Reed-Bey v. Pramstaller, 603 F.3d 322, 324\n(6th Cir. 2010)); Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90 (“The PLRA attempts to eliminate\nunwarranted federal-court interference with the administration of prisons, and thus\nseeks to ‘afford corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints\ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal case.’”).  Therefore, it is important\nthat “[t]he issues [a plaintiff] may raise … in [her] lawsuit are limited to the specific\nissues raised … in [her] grievance.”  Vandiver v. Martin, 48 F.

Mich. Dep’t of Corr., No. 1:10 CV 880, 2013 WL 5442400, at *7\n(W.D. Mich. June 24, 2013) (explaining that the plaintiff was required to bring the\nspecific  allegations  to  the  attention  of  prison  officials  through  the  grievance\nprocedure); Bartelson v. Parker, No. 19-cv-281, 2019 WL 3849159, at *1 (E.D. Ky.\nAug. 15, 2019) (concluding that plaintiff’s § 1983 claim regarding a strip search\nconducted in view of other inmates was not exhausted when the underlying grievance\n“complained only that the search was done in front of a security camera [but] did not\nallege or complain that it was conducted in front of other inmates”). \nHere,  while  Plaintiffs  have  submitted  a  few  unexhausted  grievances\ncomplaining about the “spread labia” chair strip search Policy as applied to the\nindividual grievant, there is no grievance in the record complaining that other inmates\nwere in the room or otherwise complaining about the “non-private” nature of the\nsearch, and thus no grievance that would serve to provide notice of this alleged\nconstitutional violation to prison officials.  In addition, even the Warden Forum\nCommittee notes produced earlier in this litigation fail to include any mention of a\n37\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3992    Page 38 of 54\ncomplaint about the “non-private” nature of any search, although there were other\ndiscussions regarding the manner of search, whether it violated religious principles,\netc. (ECF No. 67-2, Warden Forum Comm. Notes, PgID 882, 889, 896-97, 899-90.) \nAccordingly, there is no record evidence before the Court that Defendants were “on\nnotice” of any complaint that strip searches were being conducted in a “non-private”\nmanner in violation of the chair strip search Policy.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded at\nthe hearing on the original motion for class certification that Plaintiffs’ inability to\ndemonstrate a class member’s exhaustion of any grievance regarding the “non-\nprivate” nature of any search would result in dismissal of that Plaintiff or putative\nclass member from the action. \niii. Plaintiffs and putative class members were required to\ngrieve alleged violations of the strip search policy\nThe MDOC policy directive on Prisoner/Parolee Grievances, PD 03.02.130,\nprovides that while “[a] grievant may not grieve the content of policy or procedure\nexcept as it was specifically applied to the grievant[,]” (PD 03.02.130(F)(1) (emphasis\nadded), PgID 471-72), “[g]rievances may be submitted regarding alleged violations\nof policy or procedure or unsatisfactory conditions of confinement which directly\naffect the grievant, including alleged violations of this policy and related procedures.” \n(Id.. (E) (emphasis added).)  Thus, prisoners may grieve alleged violations of policy\n38\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3993    Page 39 of 54\nor procedure as well as the content of policies or procedures as “specifically applied”\nto them, and they must exhaust those grievances before they are permitted to seek\nrelief in federal court.  See Jones, 549 U.S. at 211; Owens v. Keeling, 461 F.3d 763,\n769 (6th Cir. 2006) (“So long as the prison system has an administrative process that\nwill review a prisoner’s complaint … the prisoner must exhaust his prison remedies.”)\n(quoting Wyatt v. Leonard, 193 F.3d 876, 878 (6th Cir. 1999)).  This requirement\napplies  to  “all  inmate  suits  about  prison  life,  whether  they  involve  general\ncircumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some\nother wrong.”  Porter v. Nussle, 534 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir. 2002).\nPlaintiffs try to get around the requirement that they must exhaust their\nadministrative remedies in part by arguing that “[a]s implemented policy, the strip\nsearch was not a matter to be addressed through the filing of grievances.”  (Pls. Mot.\n8, PgID 722, citing Ex. 2, Warden Warren Dep. 8.)   Plaintiffs refer to testimony that\nDefendant Warren provided in her deposition:\nQ.  . . . What types of issues can be grieved?\nA.  Grieved by?\nQ.  Inmates.\nA.  Prisoners can grieve any issue they feel is unjust. However, they\ncannot grieve policy.\n39\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3994    Page 40 of 54\nQ.  Okay. So when, as here in this case, there are complaints about an\nexisting policy, what can the inmate do besides a grievance to\nhave their issues heard?\nA.  Once they grieve through the third step and have exhausted all of\ntheir remedies, they can then go to a court for a decision. \nQ.  If they can't grieve the policy, so they can’t even get to the three-\nstep process, what can they do as an alternative?\nA.  They can always grieve even if it is denied. They just have to\nexhaust their remedies.\n(Warren Dep. 8:1-22, PgID 745.)  Plaintiffs similarly contend in their Reply brief that\nthey “learned throughout discovery that the strip search procedure was policy and\ntherefore not grievable” because “[a]s the MDOC does not permit inmates to grieve\npolicy, such as the strip search procedure, the Plaintiffs cannot be required to have\nfiled futile grievances merely to exhaust administrative remedies.”  (ECF No. 73, Pls.’\nReply 2, PgID 1806.)\nFirst, Plaintiffs have cited no authority for their argument that the perceived (or\neven actual) futility of filing grievances is a basis for excusing noncompliance with\nthe PLRA’s administrative exhaustion requirement, and the governing case law\nweighs in the opposite direction.  See Hix v. Tennessee Dep’t of Corr., 196 F. App’x\n350,  354  (6th  Cir.  2006)  (“There  is  no  futility  exception  to  the  exhaustion\nrequirement.”) (citing Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.6 (2001)); Jones v.\nDouglas, 108 F. App’x 254, 256 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[U]nder Booth, even futile claims\n40\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3995    Page 41 of 54\nmust be exhausted under § 1997e(a) before filing a § 1983 complaint.”) (citing Booth,\n532 U.S. at 738); see also Cox v. Mayer, 332 F.3d 422, 428 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Wrote\nthe Court: ‘[The Court] will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory\nexhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise.’ And so, neither\nshall we.”) (quoting Booth, 532 at 741 n. 6).\nSecond, as explained below, the assertion that Plaintiffs would not be permitted\nto grieve the “content” of policy would be true if Plaintiffs were making a facial\nchallenge to the blanket application of the MDOC chair strip search policy (i.e.,\narguing  that  a  specific  section  of  the  policy  as  outlined  in  PD  04.04.110  was\nunconstitutional), but they are not.   They are plainly alleging a violation of that policy\n“as it was specifically applied” to them.4\n4 Plaintiffs claim that “[m]any of the grievances filed by women subjected to the strip\nsearch procedure were rejected for reason that the inmates were ‘unable to grieve\npolicy.’” (Pls. Mot. 9, PgID 723, referring to Wascher-McIntosh Griev. and Turner\nGriev.)  However, a review of those grievances reveals that is simply not true.  Rather,\nthose grievances were rejected as “untimely” filed.  Specifically, in the two grievances\ncited by Plaintiffs, it was the grievant herself who claimed that she did not file the\ngrievance earlier because she allegedly was told it was not a grievable issue because\nit was policy, while each grievance indicates that it was actually rejected because it\nwas untimely. (See Wascher-McIntosh Griev., PgID 746, Turner Griev., PgID 757.) \nPlaintiffs have failed to produce even one grievance that was rejected as improperly\ngrieving the content of the strip search policy as opposed to a violation of the policy. \nIndeed, Plaintiff’s Abcumby’s grievance documents attached as an exhibit to earlier\nfilings in this case indicate that she was expressly instructed to grieve the issue.\n(Abcumby Griev., PgID 919.)  \n41\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3996    Page 42 of 54\nThus, to the extent Plaintiffs or putative class members are complaining that\nthey were subjected to a strip search “in the presence of individuals other than the\nofficer and the inmate, for whose presence there was no legitimate penological\njustification,” they are necessarily complaining about a violation of the applicable\npolicy or procedure as “specifically applied” to them, and not about the “content of\na policy or procedure.”  Accordingly, Plaintiffs were, pursuant to PD 03.02.130,\nrequired to file grievances regarding such alleged violations and to exhaust those\ngrievances prior to bringing such a claim in this Court.  See Townsend v. Ouellette,\nNo. 1:17-cv-935, 2019 WL 1333741, at *5 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 11, 2019) (plaintiff was\nrequired to grieve a dispute about the content of a policy directive regarding religious\nbeliefs “‘as it was specifically applied’ to him”) (citing Wayne v. Heyns, No. 1:13-cv-\n1308, 2015 WL 1478205, at *8 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2015) (“To the extent that\nplaintiff is asserting claims based on the policy directive as it was specifically applied\nto him, it is pellucid that he was required to exhaust his claims through the MDOC’s\ngrievance process before he filed his suit.”)), report and recommendation adopted by\n2019 WL 1332017 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 25, 2019); see also Doe 1 v. Mich. Dep’t of\nCorr., No. 13-14356, 2016 WL 465496, at *7-9 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 8, 2016) (requiring\nexhaustion of prisoners’ complaints about MDOC housing policy as “specifically\napplied” to them). Therefore, Plaintiffs were plainly required to file a grievance\n42\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3997    Page 43 of 54\nregarding any alleged violation of the strip search policy as applied to them, unless the\ngrievance procedure was “unavailable” as described below.\niv. Any analysis regarding the “unavailability” of the\ngrievance  process  would  require  individualized\nassessment precluding certification.\nAs explained above, the duty to exhaust administrative remedies under the\nPLRA is mandatory and without exception.  Jones, 549 U.S. at 211 (“There is no\nquestion that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims\ncannot be brought in court.”)  The “one significant qualifier” in the statute is that “the\nremedies must indeed be ‘available’ to the prisoner.”  Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850,\n1856 (2016).  “Available” means “‘capable of use,’” and thus “an inmate is required\nto exhaust those, but only those, grievance procedures that are ‘capable of use’ to\nobtain ‘some relief for the action complained of.’”  Id. at 1858-59 (citation omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has identified three examples of circumstances that make a\nprocedure unavailable: (1) “when (despite what regulations or guidance materials\npromise) it operates as a simple dead end – with officers unable or consistently\nunwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates”; (2) “an administrative scheme\nmight be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use”; and (3)\n“when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance\nprocess through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.”  Id. at 1859-60.\n43\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3998    Page 44 of 54\nPlaintiffs appear to suggest (although they have never directly argued such a\npoint by citing relevant authority or specific record evidence) that they and at least\nsome putative class members should be excused from the mandatory requirement to\nexhaust their administrative remedies regarding claimed violations of the strip search\npolicy because they were allegedly prevented or “thwarted” from pursuing those\nremedies when certain plaintiffs were allegedly told by corrections personnel that they\ncould not grieve “policy.”  (See Pls.’ Mot. 9-11, PgID 723-25; Compl., ¶¶ 35-38,\nalleging that Plaintiffs “are regularly not allowed to file grievances challenging\npolicies or procedures and Defendants do not provide an alternative administrative\nmechanism to exhaust the claims set forth in this Complaint.”)  As another court in\nthis District has previously recognized:\nCourts have held that prison officials may render the process unavailable\nif they provide incorrect information about filing or fail to respond\nappropriately to a plaintiff's request to file. See, e.g., Davis v. Fernandez,\n798 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 2015) (“Grievance procedures are unavailable to\nan inmate if the correctional facility’s staff misled the inmate as to the\nexistence or rules of the grievance process so as to cause the inmate to\nfail to exhaust such process.”); Pavey v. Conley, 663 F.3d 899, 906 (7th\nCir. 2011) (“An administrative remedy is not ‘available,’ and therefore\ndoes not need to be exhausted, if prison officials erroneously inform an\ninmate that the remedy does not exist or inaccurately describe the steps\nhe needs to take to pursue it.”); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 268 (5th\nCir. 2010) (“When a prisoner has no means of verifying prison officials’\nclaims about the administrative grievance process, incorrect statements\nby officials may indeed make remedies unavailable.”); Brown v. Croak,\n312 F.3d 109, 112 (3rd Cir. 2002) (finding that the plaintiff raised a\n44\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.3999    Page 45 of 54\nquestion of fact about the availability of grievances when he was given\nincorrect filing information); Smith v. Woods, No. 9:03-CV-480, 2006\nWL 1133247, at *15 (N.D.N.Y. April 24, 2006) (“[C]ase law exists\nsupporting the proposition that, assuming plaintiff was instructed by\nprison officials, contrary to prison regulations, that he could not file a\ngrievance, and plaintiff indeed did not initiate the grievance process by\nfiling that grievance in reliance on that misrepresentation,” the process\nwas unavailable.) However, the Sixth Circuit has indicated that even in\nthese situations, “the prisoner must make some affirmative efforts to\ncomply with the administrative procedure.” Brock v. Kenton Cty., Ky.,\n93 F. App’x 793, 798 (6th Cir. 2004). The efforts must be “‘sufficient\nunder the circumstances.’” Lee v. Willey, 789 F.3d 673, 677 (6th Cir.\n2015).\nVeeder v. Tri-Cap, No. 17-cv-11690, 2018 WL 7254610, at *7 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 13,\n2018), report and recommendation adopted by 2019 WL 208281 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 15,\n2019).  The Sixth Circuit explained that when “[f]aced with a policy that was not\nclearly unavailable, the only way to determine if the process was available, or futile,\nwas to try.  Here, a process existed, and therefore … ‘compliance with those rules …\nis required.’”  Napier v. Laurel Cty., Ky., 636 F.3d 218, 224 (6th Cir. 2011) (citation\nomitted).5  Further, “[i]t is well established in this Circuit that nonspecific allegations\n5 The Napier court explained that:\nOur Court has consistently analyzed whether an inmate’s efforts to\nexhaust were sufficient under the circumstances, but in each case, the\nprisoner did something. See Bruce v. Corr. Med. Serv., Inc., 389 Fed.\nAppx. 462, 467 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting that prisoner attempted to file a\ngrievance and “was told Policy 501.01 would not allow it”); Flournoy v.\nSchomig, 152 Fed. Appx. 535, 537 (7th Cir. 2005) (recognizing that\nplaintiff  had  submitted  an  “emergency  grievance”  before  being\ntransferred, then filed another after transfer); Rancher v. Franklin Cnty.,\n45\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4000    Page 46 of 54\nof  fear  and  subjective  feelings  of  futility  will  not  excuse  a  failure  to  exhaust\nadministrative remedies.”  Buffman v. United States, No. 13-cv-14024, 2015 WL\n71840, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 6, 2015) (citing Boyd v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 380 F.3d\n989, 998 (6th Cir. 2004)). \nThus, Plaintiffs’ suggestion that they or certain class members were misled\nabout their ability to grieve the chair strip searches at issue here, if true, may raise a\nquestion  of  fact  as  to  whether  the  administrative  remedies  for  those  particular\nPlaintiffs/putative plaintiffs were “unavailable” to them.  This will require a fact\nintensive review for each claim that is not amenable to class-wide determination. \nResolution of those claims would devolve into mini-trials on exhaustion for each class\nmember regarding what each Plaintiff or putative plaintiff knew or should have\ndiscovered about the grievance process,  which MDOC individual(s) each class\nmember allegedly spoke to, what was said and when.  Plaintiffs also will be required\nto demonstrate, for every claimed “unavailable remedy,” the “affirmative efforts”\nmade  to  comply  with  the  grievance  procedure  “under  the  circumstances”  (i.e.,\n122 Fed. Appx. 240, 242 (6th Cir. 2005) (excusing the exhaustion\nrequirement because the prisoner had filed a grievance with the jail,\ncontacted  prison  personnel,  and  submitted  documents  from  other\nprisoners stating that the jail had refused to accept medical grievances).\nNapier, 636 F.3d at 224 (emphasis in original).\n46\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4001    Page 47 of 54\nattempts to file a grievance) and the results of those efforts.  And if Plaintiffs make\nthis showing, Defendants then would be permitted to respond to each claim and\n“present evidence showing that the plaintiff’s ability to exhaust was not hindered.” \nSurles, 678 F.3d at 457 n.10; see also McBee v. Campbell Cty. Detention Ctr., No. 17-\n5481, 2018 WL 2046303, at *4 (6th Cir. Mar. 15, 2018) (requiring “defendants [to]\npresent ‘proof that they did not interfere with [a prisoner’s] ability to exhaust [her]\nadministrative remedies’”) (quoting Surles, 678 F.3d at 457); Doe 1, 2016 WL\n465496, at *11 (noting that if a plaintiff contends he was prevented from exhausting\nhis administrative remedies, the defendant must present evidence that the plaintiff’s\nability was not hindered).  See also Ratliff v. Graves, 761 F. App’x 565, 566-67 (6th\nCir. 2019) (plaintiff’s remedies not unavailable even though jailer failed to provide\ngrievance forms in response to several requests where evidence showed that plaintiff\nfailed to ask other jailers for forms and failed to establish that other jailers “thwarted”\nhim); Doe 1, 2016 WL 465496, at *11 (grievance procedure not unavailable even\nthough “prisoners were informed that the issues ‘will be handled administratively’ and\nthat the investigations were conducted and closed by PREA investigators, and thus\n“‘Defendants did not utilize the grievance procedure to resolve the sexual misconduct\ngrievances and the response of the MDOC did not allow for any appeal to step 2 or\n47\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4002    Page 48 of 54\n3 of the grievance process’” because plaintiffs still could have appealed to step 2 or\n3 if dissatisfied or if they did not receive a timely response).  \nThe  need  for  individualized  inquiries  as  to  liability,  exhaustion,  and  the\navailability of exhaustion defeats commonality and typicality, and results in the\ncertainty that individualized factual and legal issues would predominate over class-\nwide issues.\nC. Ascertainability\nAlthough generally a threshold issue, the Court notes here in closing that the\nproposed Plaintiff class is not sufficiently ascertainable. “[B]efore a court may certify\na class pursuant to Rule 23, ‘the class definition must be sufficiently definite so that\nit is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual\nis a member of the proposed class.’” Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532,\n537-38 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted); Newberg on Class Actions § 3:3 (5th ed.)\n(“Courts generally treat the requirement [of definiteness] as a precursor to Rule 23 and\ntherefore examine the implicit requirements before proceeding the Rule's explicit\nrequirements.”) In evaluating the “ascertainability” of a class, the Sixth Circuit has\nindicated that class definitions which are “amorphous” or “imprecise” do not meet this\nstandard. Id. at 537-38 (citation omitted). Further, \n48\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4003    Page 49 of 54\n[f]or a class to be sufficiently defined, the court must be able to resolve\nthe question of whether class members are included or excluded from the\nclass  by  reference  to  objective  criteria.  In  some  circumstances,  a\nreference to damages or injuries caused by particular wrongful actions\ntaken by the defendants will be sufficiently objective for proper inclusion\nin a class definition. \nId. at 538-39 (citation omitted); Newberg on Class Actions § 3.1 (5th ed.) (“Despite\nthe specificity of Rule 23, courts have grafted onto it two additional criteria, often\nreferred to as the ‘implicit requirements’ of class certification: that the class be\n‘definite’ or ‘ascertainable’ and that the class representative be a member of the\nclass.”).\nApplying these standards, this Court found in its initial Order denying class\ncertification that the proposed class definition quoted above “is ascertainable and can\nbe determined based on objective criteria such as exhausted grievances” (12/22/16\nOrder 11, Pg ID 516), but went on to deny Plaintiffs’ initial class certification motion\non a combination of numerosity, typicality, and adequacy grounds (see id. at 11-15,\nPg ID 516-20). Now, Defendants argue in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class\nCertification that Plaintiffs have failed to show that administrative grievances are in\nfact a valid method for determining an ascertainable class, since they have failed “to\nsubmit any exhausted grievances, even after they have acknowledged that the best\n49\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4004    Page 50 of 54\nmeans of ascertaining the class is by exhausted grievances.”  (Defs.’ Resp. 4, PgID\n942.)\nIn  their  Reply,  Plaintiffs  propose  a  new  criteria  for  ascertaining  class\nmembership: the 188 affidavits discussed at length supra that have been sworn by\ninmates who allege that they were subjected to “chair” strip searches at WHV in view\nof other inmates or individuals not necessary to serve any penological purpose. (ECF\nNos. 92, 93, 94.) Although they assert that they “initially believed that they would be\nable  to  use  the  grievances  as  an  ascertainable  means  for  determining  class\nmembership,  the  Plaintiffs  learned  throughout  discovery  that  the  strip  search\nprocedure was policy and therefore not grievable.” (ECF No. 73, Pls.’ Reply Supp.\nClass Cert. at 2, Pg ID 1806.) Plaintiffs also cite Sixth Circuit authority supporting the\nuse of class-member affidavits as a method of determining ascertainability, at least\nwhere there are other independent means of verifying class membership. See Rikos v.\nProcter & Gamble Co., 799 F.3d 497, 525-27 (6th Cir. 2015) (upholding the district\ncourt’s determination that a proposed class was ascertainable because the class was\ndefined by objective criteria, and could be corroborated through the use of the\ndefendant’s internal data and class member affidavits).   However Rikos is not a case\ncontrolled in any way by the exhaustion requirements of the PLRA.  In fact, Plaintiffs\nhave failed to cite any law that stands for the proposition that inmate affidavits,\n50\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4005    Page 51 of 54\nsubmitted years after the events they purport to describe, can substitute for properly\nfiled and exhausted contemporaneous grievances.  Indeed to allow such a practice\nwould thwart the very purpose of the grievance exhaustion requirement, which is to\nalert the institution to the allegedly offending conduct and to permit the institution an\nopportunity to address that conduct short of a legal confrontation with the inmate. \nWithout first addressing the exhaustion of each class member’s grievance of the non-\nprivate nature of the search, the class as defined is not sufficiently ascertainable. \nD. Conclusion as to Class Certification\n“The crux of this case is commonality.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349.  Individualized\nissues as to liability and exhaustion as to each putative class members’ chair search\nexperiences abound and defeat commonality and typicality in this action, and those\nindividualized inquiries predominate over any class-wide issues that Plaintiffs have\npresented.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class is DENIED.\nIII. The Court Will Hold a Bench Trial on the Issue of the Two Named\nPlaintiffs’ Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies to Determine Whether\nThis Action May Proceed to Trial as to the Two Named Plaintiffs\nAs discussed above, there are disputed issues of fact regarding whether the two\nnamed Plaintiffs, Abcumby and Salem, have exhausted their administrative remedies\nregarding the sole remaining issue in this case – that they were subjected to chair strip\n51\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4006    Page 52 of 54\nsearches performed in the presence of individuals who were unnecessary to the\npenological purposes of the search – including whether exhaustion may be excused\nif those remedies were “unavailable” to each of the plaintiffs.  The Sixth Circuit Court\nof Appeals has held that “disputed issues of fact regarding exhaustion under the PLRA\npresent[] a matter of judicial administration that could be decided in a bench trial.” \nLee v. Willey, 789 F.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015).6  In deciding that issue, the Sixth\nCircuit explained that “exhaustion under the PLRA is analogous to other threshold\nissues of judicial administration that ‘courts must address to determine whether\nlitigation is being conducted in the right forum at the right time,’” and that “[m]atters\nof judicial administration often require judges to decide factual disputes that are not\nbound up with the merits of the underlying dispute.”  Id. (quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).  The rationale behind a judge making a preliminary determination\nregarding exhaustion under the PLRA is that “[a] jury might decide the merits of the\ncase that should never have gotten to the merits stage because the judge should have\n6 The Lee court noted that “all six of the circuits that have addressed th[is] issue agree\nthat ‘judges may resolve factual disputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the\nparticipation of the jury.’”  Id. at 677-78 (citing Small v. Camden Cty., 728 F.3d 265,\n271 (3d Cir. 2013); Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 308-09 (2d Cir. 2011) (per\ncuriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 272 (5th Cir. 2010); Pavey v.

Mich. Aug. 25, 2017), report\nand recommendation adopted by 2017 WL 4150789 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 19, 2017). \nWithin the context of these evidentiary hearings, federal district court judges can\nresolve all genuine issues of material fact related to the exhaustion of administrative\nremedies, including making credibility determinations, and these findings must be\naccepted unless they are clearly erroneous.  Lee, 789 F.3d at 678-80; Hill v. Smith, 186\nF. App’x 271, 274 (3d Cir. 2006) (review of a district court’s “factual findings on\nexhaustion is for clear error, giving due regard for the opportunity of the trial court to\njudge the credibility of the witnesses.”).\nAccordingly, the matter will be set for a bench/evidentiary hearing directed\nsolely to the issue of whether Plaintiffs Salem and Abcumby have exhausted their\nadministrative remedies regarding the claim that they were subject to chair strip\nsearches performed in the presence of individuals who were unnecessary to the\nlegitimate penological purpose of the search, including whether the grievance process\nfor that claim was “unavailable” to either Plaintiff.  The parties may submit exhibits\nlimited solely to this issue, which may include affidavits or declarations of Abcumby,\nSalem and/or the MDOC officials involved in the grievance process and any relevant\nMDOC grievance records for the two named Plaintiffs, including any MDOC Step III\n53\n\nCase 2:13-cv-14567-PDB-RSW   ECF No. 101   filed 09/16/19    PageID.4008    Page 54 of 54\nGrievance Report(s) with attached grievances for Abcumby and/or Salem.  Affidavits,\ndeclarations or other documents regarding grievance records for prisoners or former\nprisoners other than Abcumby and Salem may not be submitted to the Court for\npurposes of this evidentiary hearing.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class (ECF No. 66) is\nDENIED.  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Leave of Court to File Additional Affidavits (ECF No.\n95) is DENIED.\nA bench trial on the issue of the named Plaintiffs’ exhaustion of administrative\nremedies will be held on November 6, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to file with the Court and to submit to opposing counsel bench briefs up\nto ten (10) pages in length (in compliance with E.D.
