    "summary": "<p>On January 27, 2016, Concerned Pastors for Social Action filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the state of Michigan and the city of Flint under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;300j-8(a). The plaintiffs, represented by counsel from the ACLU, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested that the court: (1) declare the defendants were in violation of their duties under the Safe Drinking Water Act, (2) enjoin the defendants from continuing to violate the Safe Drinking Water Act, (3) order that the defendants take all steps necessary to remedy their violations, and (4) grant any equitable relief the court deemed necessary to mitigate the health and medical risks faced by Flint residents.</p>\r\n<p>The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that cities must mitigate lead in their water. Part of mitigation is taking account of the corrosiveness of the water; the more corrosive the water, the more it breaks down a protective layer surrounding the lead pipes that water is carried in. This protective layer is built up over time and nearly impossible to restore. According to the Safe Drinking Water Act, once a city reaches optimal corrosion treatment, it must maintain that optimal level of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The background of this case is that Flint is a struggling city; more than 40% of its residents live below the poverty level, and nearly 25% of its working age citizens are currently unemployed. In 2011, in response to the economic hardship Flint was facing, Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency. He stripped the elected city officials of their power and installed an Emergency Manager to oversee the city in November 2011. Flint had historically received its drinking water from Detroit. Detroit&rsquo;s drinking water is drawn from Lake Huron and treated with chemicals to make it less corrosive. Detroit&rsquo;s water was &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; meaning it was safe to drink. In March of 2013, when the price of Detroit&rsquo;s water rose, Flint's Emergency Manager decided to switch its drinking water source to a new water supply system. This system was based around a new water pipeline that was not scheduled to finish until June 2016.</p>\r\n<p>According to the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint, the governor&rsquo;s appointed Emergency Manager did not want to negotiate with Detroit over its higher prices to supply the city's water until the new pipeline could be finished. In early 2014, the Emergency Manager decided that the Flint River would be the city's water supply in the meantime. At that time, Flint had not treated its own water in nearly 50 years. The Flint River had known problems&mdash;swimming in the water was not recommended because of elevated levels of bacteria, fish in the river contained mercury (a neurotoxin) and PCB (a carcinogen), and local industrial and agricultural runoff caused high levels of contamination. In 2011, outside consultants had concluded that, in order to use the Flint River as a drinking water source, the city&rsquo;s system would need $50 million in upgrades. The Flint Water System did not perform all of these upgrades. They did not undertake the research required by the Safe Drinking Water Act to learn how to optimize corrosion control. Nonetheless, on April 29, 2014, the Flint Water System began pumping Flint River water into the homes of its customers. It did not treat the water to reduce its corrosiveness at all. And it did not attempt to minimize the leaching of lead from its pipes.</p>\r\n<p>The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the agency in charge of enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act in Michigan, started notifying the city of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act as early as December 2014. The city continued to tell its citizens that the water was safe to drink. After a customer started reporting health problems in her children in early 2015, the EPA, the MDEQ, and the city of Flint were notified of the high levels of lead in the city&rsquo;s water. No one notified Flint&rsquo;s residents. After Flint&rsquo;s situation started garnering more attention, the city expanded its budget in order to buy water from Detroit. But the damage had been done. The lead of the pipe was exposed due to the corrosiveness of the Flint River water. Even purchasing water from Detroit could not help&mdash;the tap water still contained lead in actionable concentrations. Flint&rsquo;s mayor declared a state of emergency in Flint in December of 2015. Governor Snyder declared a state of emergency in Genesee County on January 5, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 2016, the EPA used its authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act to issue an Emergency Administrative Order directing the city of Flint, the MDEQ, and the state of Michigan to take certain remedial measures. Although Flint said it would comply with the EPA&rsquo;s order, the other two necessary decisionmakers, Michigan and the MDEQ, challenged the EPA&rsquo;s authority. Meanwhile, Flint&rsquo;s drinking water still posed an imminent health threat to its citizens. This case was filed a week later, and was assigned, randomly, to Judge Mark Goldsmith.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2016, the state defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Primarily, they alleged that the sole authority over the Flint Water Crisis rested with the EPA and that the court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction. Additionally, the state defendants stated that they had Eleventh Amendment protection because the plaintiffs sought relief for &ldquo;past violations&rdquo; of the Safe Drinking Water Act; the designation of \"past\" violation matters because the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity for state actors is only for <em>prospective</em> declaratory and injunctive relief. The state defendants also noted they were not &ldquo;owners or operators&rdquo; of the Flint Water System and therefore could not be sued under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2016, the plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction. They asserted that they would be likely to succeed on the merits because the defendants were still failing to adhere to optimal corrosion control or monitor the lead in the water. The named defendants were all &ldquo;owners and operators&rdquo; of the Flint Water System&mdash;even the state defendants because of their control over the finances and operations of the system due to the appointment of the Emergency Manager. The plaintiffs also asserted irreparable harm&mdash;Flint&rsquo;s drinking water remained unsafe to drink, and portions of Flint&rsquo;s population lacked reliable alternatives to the tap water.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2016, the defendants asked Judge Goldsmith to recuse himself. In 2014, Judge Goldsmith worked for four weeks in Flint and drank the lead-laden water. The defendants asked the court to consider the &ldquo;appearance of . . . impropriety.&rdquo; On April 26, 2016, Judge Goldsmith recused himself over the protests of the plaintiffs, who thought his recusal might cause too long of a delay. By a second random draw, Judge David M. Lawson was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, 2016, Judge Lawson denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that under the Administrative Procedure Act, district courts could review EPA compliance orders, despite the assertion that only a circuit court could issue judicial review. As for the specific compliance orders regarding the Safe Drinking Water Act, the court determined that the plaintiffs were not seeking an appeal of a final determination of an EPA compliance order, because they were not subject to the compliance order and would probably like to see the order enforced. Because the suit was entirely collateral to the EPA compliance order, the court determined that it had subject-matter jurisdiction. The court also declined to abstain from the case under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, and found that the relief requested by the plaintiffs was prospective and therefore excluded the state defendants from Eleventh Amendment immunity. (The harm was &ldquo;not, as the defendants would read it, the damage to the lead service pipes, [but i]nstead, the harm is the continued leaching of lead into the drinking water.&rdquo;) Finally, the court determined that the plaintiffs had alleged enough facts to determine that the state actors were indeed operators of the Water System, despite Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act precedent that seemed to indicate the contrary. 194 F. Supp. 3d. 589.</p>\r\n<p>On November 10, 2016, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary relief. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that they were likely to succeed on the merits and that at least some Flint residents struggled to obtain the water that they needed to sustain themselves. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to provide door-to-door water bottle delivery to all non-exempt houses serviced by the Flint Water System. Exempt houses were those that had a filter, those that refused to permit a water filter to be installed, those that affirmatively opted out of the filter service, and those that were non-occupied. Additionally, the defendants were ordered to provide updated information about the status of the water supply to residents; the information was to be presented in English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and Hmong, so that it would be accessible to the vast majority of the houses serviced by the system. &nbsp;217 F. Supp. 3d 960.</p>\r\n<p>On November 17, 2016, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending the appeal of the decision with the Sixth Circuit. Notice of the appeal was filed with the court on November 21, 2016. On December 2, 2016, the district court denied a motion to stay, believing that the Sixth Circuit was unlikely to find for the defendants.</p>\r\n<p>The lower court was proven correct. On December 16, 2016, the Sixth Circuit, in a per curiam decision joined by Judges Damon Keith and Bernice Donald, denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay. It also held that the defendants had only a slim likelihood of success on the merits and were unlikely to be irreparably harmed by the preliminary injunction. Judge Jeffrey Sutton dissented, believing that the defendants had a strong likelihood of success on the merits. Judge Sutton also advised that the parties \"talk to each other,\" stating &ldquo;everyone has the same interests in mind: delivery of safe water.&rdquo; 844 F.3d 546. (Sutton, J., dissenting).</p>\r\n<p>The parties did end up talking to each other&mdash;by March 27, 2017, they reached a settlement. The defendants agreed to replace the lead service lines to at least 18,000 households served by the Flint Water System. The city agreed to excavate pipes and replace any lead pipe it discovered with copper pipe at no cost to the recipient. This was to be accomplished within three years of the effective date. The state of Michigan agreed to allocate $87,000,000 to the replacement of the service lines. Flint&rsquo;s water was to be monitored regularly for consecutive 6 month periods. Water samples collected by the defendants were to be reviewed by an independent monitor. Discontinuation of funding for the monitoring program was to occur in the event that the 90th percentile of lead in the water samples contained below-actionable levels of lead for two consecutive 6-month periods. The defendants were also instructed to expand their installation and maintenance of and education on water filters.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants were to continue distributing water until May 1, 2017. On May 1, the defendants could start closing points of distribution if the average number of daily bottle pickups was less than 20 for the first three weeks of the previous month and the point of distribution provided clear notice of their impending closure for at least a week. The state defendants were directed to maintain health programs, like the Medicaid expansion, the Elevated Blood Lead Level Case Management service, the Michigan Food Pantry expansion, and the Child and Adolescent Health Center expansion.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement also provided for $895,000 in attorneys' fees for the plaintiffs' counsel and for the court to maintain jurisdiction in order to enforce the settlement. On March 27, 2017, the court issued an order approving the settlement agreement and dismissing the case. Accordingly, on March 31, 2017, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal of the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On December 27, 2017, the plaintiffs sought judicial enforcement of the information sharing provisions of the settlement agreement (paragraphs 117 and 118). The plaintiffs alleged that, for nine months, the state was not complying with these provisions, as they had failed to provide the plaintiffs with timely, accurate, and complete status reports and timely responses to the plaintiffs&rsquo; requests for additional information. There were three particular areas on which the state failed to provide status reports: (1) verification of filter installations following service line replacements, (2) a maintained list of addresses of the residents who refused to grant the city permission to replace their service lines, and (3) the notification of new water system customers to CORE staff so these individuals could provide filter services promptly. Because this non-compliance made it difficult for the plaintiffs to enforce the agreement, they sought a more extensive reporting and certification process and greater oversight from the court. On March 15, 2018, Judge Lawson granted the plaintiffs' request.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed another motion to enforce the settlement agreement on June 21, 2018. This time, the plaintiffs alleged further noncompliance. Under the agreement, paragraph 29 required the city to conduct 18,000 excavations to replace the lead and galvanized steel pipes with copper ones. While the agreement required a minimum of 18,000 excavations it was unclear how many lead and steel services were actually located in the city. Therefore, the city was required to excavate at least 6,000 lines and use the data from those excavations to estimate (1) whether it was likely that more than 18,000 of these pipes existed within the city and (2) whether the $97 million in funding allocated under the agreement would sufficiently cover the cost of excavation and replacement, or if the state needed to find additional funding. Paragraph 30 required the state to commission a report as to their findings from the initial excavations. The state submitted its report on February 8, 2018, stating that it found lead and galvanized steel service lines at roughly 70.7% of the 8,843 homes where excavations were conducted. It concluded (1) it was not reasonably likely that there were more than 18,000 of these service lines within the city and (2) the $97 million in funding would reasonably cover the costs for the remainder of the excavations. The city reached this conclusion by assuming that the 70% rate would continue to drop each year. In their motion, the plaintiffs alleged that the city&rsquo;s conclusions were based on flawed methods and presumptions and requested the court to order the city to revise its conclusions based on sound methods conducted by experts.</p>\r\n<p>Before this motion was resolved, the plaintiffs filed a motion to also have paragraphs 38 and 117 of the agreement enforced by the court. The settlement agreement required the city to take steps to ensure the health and safety of all city residents during and after the excavations. Specifically, paragraph 38 required the city to install a faucet filter at each home immediately after its service line is replaced to reduce the risk of increased lead levels in the water. Paragraph 117 required the city to produce a quarterly status report regarding this progress. The plaintiffs alleged that, according to the city&rsquo;s quarterly report on May 25th, the city had delayed installation of filtration faucets and inadequately documented and reported filter verification efforts. The plaintiffs requested that the court force the city to comply with these two provisions of the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>After a consolidated hearing on the two outstanding enforcement motions, Judge Lawson ordered the enforcement of paragraphs 38 and 117 on September 10, 2018. Judge Lawson ordered the city to attempt proper filter installation within three business days of service line replacement and to provide the plaintiffs with weekly reports describing the city&rsquo;s filter installation processes. The plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief that enforcement of these paragraphs would render the previous motion unnecessary. The plaintiffs withdrew their motion to enforce paragraphs 29 and 30 and Judge Lawson subsequently dismissed the motion as moot on October 5.</p>\r\n<p>The court first amended the settlement agreement on March 26, 2019. The amendments focused on an excavation list that would consist of addresses of occupied residential homes in Flint with the highest likelihood of having lead or galvanized steel service lines, based on a predictive model. Two months later, the court amended the settlement agreement for the second time. These amendments focused on the state's and city's obligations to complete initial visits to check the new Flint Water System customers. On August 24, 2020, the court again amended the settlement agreement, giving the city additional time to complete the required excavations and service line replacements at eligible homes.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2020, the plaintiffs filed their fourth motion to enforce the settlement agreement. This time the plaintiffs alleged even further noncompliance: (1) the city of Flint refused to conduct excavations and service line replacements in two neighborhoods within the city; (2) the city had not complied with the monitoring requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule for checking lead levels; (3) the city had fallen far short of its obligation to report on time information about its service line replacement activities, including its in-person outreach to residents; and (4) the city had not conducted mail and in-person outreach to residents to obtain their permission to conduct excavations and replacements in the manner contemplated by the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, 2020, the court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and ordered the city to remedy all outreach violations by October 20 by conducting in-person visits to affected homes. It required the city of Flint to conduct excavations at all homes in the University Park and Smith Village neighborhoods, to comply with the monitoring requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule by identifying 60 water sample sites that the city confirmed meet the high-risk criteria, to report on time information about its service line replacement activities, and to obtain residents' permission to conduct excavations and replacements.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a fifth motion to enforce the settlement agreement on November 1, 2022. Again, the plaintiffs alleged that the city had still not completed all required service line excavations and replacements despite more than two-and-a-half years of extensions beyond the original January 2020 deadline to complete this work. The plaintiffs also proposed a notice requirement, requesting that the court order the city to leave door hangers at residences where the city conducted a visual inspection and determined no further restoration was needed. The court granted this motion on February 24, 2023, finding that the proposed door hanger notification procedure fell in line with the city's previous commitments under the settlement agreement, and therefore would not be unduly burdensome.</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, alleging that, despite the court&rsquo;s order, the city had failed to (1) determine which homes still required property restoration; (2) provide timely, accurate, and complete monthly restoration reporting; and (3) conduct mail and in-person outreach to residents to obtain their permission to conduct service line excavations and replacements. The parties informed the court on June 29, 2023 that the city had made progress in completing outreach requirements, although litigation pertaining to the contempt motion was ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, 2024, Judge Lawson granted in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for contempt, finding that the city had not taken all reasonable steps to, nor shown an inability to, comply with the February 2023 order. Although the city was found in contempt, Judge Lawson concluded that there was not a prima facie case for finding Mayor Neeley himself in contempt of court. In light of the finding of contempt against the city, the court allowed the plaintiffs to request reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees for the enforcement of the February 2023 order. The plaintiffs filed a motion for these fees on April 8, 2024, and, on June 27, 2024, the court granted the motion for $62,367.56, comprising $51,393.50 in attorney&rsquo;s fees and $10,974.06 in costs and expenses.</p>\r\n<p>On May 29, 2024, the state filed an unopposed motion to temporarily stay specific reporting obligations regarding restoration under the settlement agreement until August 1, 2025. The city of Flint did not have funds available to complete the restoration, and the stay was requested to enable the state to step in to fund the completion of the project by the August 1 date while minimizing additional administrative costs and delays. The court granted the motion to stay on June 29, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The case is ongoing.</p>",

Honorable David M. Lawson \n \nNICK A. KHOURI, FREDERICK HEADEN, \nMICHAEL A. TOWNSEND, MICHAEL A.  \nFINNEY, JOEL FERGUSON, SYLVESTER  \nJONES, R. STEVEN BRANCH, and  \nCITY OF FLINT, \n \n      Defendants. \n__________________________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CONTEMPT \n  On March 28, 2017, the City of Flint entered into a Settlement Agreement, promising, \namong other things, to replace the water service lines made of lead that furnished water to \nresidences throughout the City.  The Settlement Agreement brought to a conclusion, or so it was \nthought at the time, a lawsuit that was filed under the Clean Water Act to redress the well-\ndocumented  and  widely  publicized  contamination  of  the  City’s  water  system  when  the \nmunicipality replaced the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which drew its water from \nLake Huron, with its own Flint-River-based system as the source of the City’s drinking water.  The \nSettlement Agreement established deadlines for various phases of the replacement and restoration \noperation.  Those benchmarks included outreach, reporting, and inspection requirement deadlines \nintended to ensure that Flint residents were notified of their rights to remediation and to permit the \nplaintiffs to monitor the City’s progress remediating the defective water distribution system.  \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13124   Filed 03/12/24   Page 2 of 30\nThose deadlines almost immediately were missed, and the plaintiffs thereafter filed motions and \nstipulations to modify them.   \n  Now, for the sixth time in six years, the plaintiffs seek to enforce the Settlement Agreement, \nas modified by the several deadline extensions that the Court has granted following the parties’ \nstipulations.  The plaintiffs allege that the City continues to miss deadlines for completing \npromised replacement work, including by failing (1) to complete by March 1, 2023 outreach to all \nhomes eligible for service line replacement; (2) to determine by May 1, 2023 the addresses where \nthe City still needs to complete restoration work; and (3) to provide accurate and complete monthly \nrestoration reports to the plaintiffs.  They ask the Court to impose coercive sanctions by holding \nthe City and its mayor, a non-party, in contempt; ordering the City and its mayor to pay a $500 \ndaily fine to the Court until it complies with the Court’s last enforcement order; and amending the \nSettlement Agreement to permit the plaintiffs to recover attorney’s fees and costs for future \nenforcement efforts.   \n  The Court held a hearing on the motion on June 30, 2023 during which the parties presented \nevidence.  The Court also permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs in August and November \n2023.  Based on the evidence, it is apparent that the City has failed to abide by the Court’s orders \nin several respects, and that it has no good reason for its failures.  The City has demonstrated \nbelated compliance since the hearing, but even now, it has not actually replaced all of the lead \nservice lines, which it originally promised to replace by March 28, 2020.  The City is in civil \ncontempt of the Court’s order.   \nI.  Factual Background \n  At the time of the June 2023 hearing on the present motion, the City of Flint had continued \nto miss deadlines for completing the water service line replacement work it promised to do when \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13125   Filed 03/12/24   Page 3 of 30\nit entered into a Settlement Agreement on March 28, 2017.  The Agreement is extensive, and the \nparties and the Court repeatedly have modified it in to ensure the City’s compliance and protect \nthe health and safety of Flint residents.  As modified, the Agreement required that the City \n“implement a plan to replace all lead and galvanized service lines at Flint residences” to reduce \nlead contamination in the City’s tap water.  4th Enforcement Order, ECF No. 228, PageID.11034.  \nIt required the City to conduct outreach to residents to seek their consent to excavate their service \nlines.  The outreach was to be made via a mailing and at least two in-person contacts, one of which \nmust occur after 5:00 p.m. or on a weekend, to all homes that had an active water account when \nor after the parties entered the Agreement.  Mar. 2019 Modification Order, ¶¶ 14-15, ECF No. 208, \nPageID.10354-55; Settlement Agreement, ¶ 11, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7365-66.  The Agreement \nalso mandates that the City address property damage caused by its service line work to residents’ \nsidewalks, curbs, and driveways.  The City must repair any damage by filling the excavation \ntrench, removing debris, ensuring uniform plant cover, and repairing any broken asphalt or \nconcrete.  2022 Modification Order, ¶ 2, ECF No. 237, PageID.11071; 5th Enforcement Order, \nECF No. 258, PageID.11694-95.  Finally, the City must make monthly status reports to the \nplaintiffs detailing its outreach and restoration efforts, and it must maintain sufficient records to \ncomply with all reporting requirements.  5th Enforcement Order, ECF No. 258at PageID.11695-\n96; Mar. 2019 Modification Order, ¶ 6, ECF No. 208, PageID.10348-49. \n  The City has not fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement as modified.  As of the filing \ndate of the plaintiffs’ motion, the City had yet to complete outreach, excavations, or restoration; it \nhad made inconsistent reports to the plaintiffs; and it repeatedly had missed deadlines.  The City’s \nviolations have caused difficulties and, in some cases, hardship to Flint residents, many of whom \nhave  waited  years  for  excavations  and  repairs.    See,  e.g.,  Diener  decl.,  ECF  No.  260-3, \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13126   Filed 03/12/24   Page 4 of 30\nPageID.11784-85 (attesting that the City did not complete restoration work at declarant’s property \nafter replacing the service line in 2019); Hayes decl., ECF No. 260-4, PageID.11787-91 (attesting \nthat the City never replaced declarant’s service line after she consented to the replacement in \n2020); Perez decl., ECF No. 260-5, PageID.11793-94 (attesting that the City determined that no \nrestoration work was needed at declarant’s property, despite the City causing extensive damage to \nhis lawn).  Many also still do not have access to safe tap water.  Because the City has yet to replace \nall water service lines, residents still are advised by the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nstate of Michigan not to drink tap water unless a special filter has been installed.  May 16, 2023 \nScripps Article, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11850-51.   \n  The Agreement states that its dispute resolution mechanism is the “sole and exclusive \nmechanism” for resolving disputes and disagreements arising out of the Agreement, and that the \nCourt has jurisdiction to enforce its terms.  Settlement Agreement, ¶¶ 125-26, ECF No. 147-1, \nPageID.7423.  It also states that no modification may be made to the Agreement absent a “joint \nstipulation of all of the Parties and a Court order.”  Id. at ¶ 138, PageID.7426-27.  And it caps the \nplaintiffs’ attorney’s fees at $895,000, which have been paid, while specifying that the payment \n“shall fully and finally release, discharge, and satisfy any claim by Plaintiffs to litigation costs \n(including attorneys’ fees and expert costs) incurred in this Case and incurred in enforcing this \nAgreement through the Termination Date.”  Id. at ¶¶ 123-24, PageID.7422-23.  However, the \nplaintiffs contend that the Agreement’s dispute resolution provisions have proved inadequate and \nits fee provisions are inequitable.  The plaintiffs explain, therefore, that they have filed the instant \ncontempt motion in an effort to coerce the City to comply with the Agreement, as well as to amend \ncertain terms of the Agreement to ensure prompt compliance.   \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13127   Filed 03/12/24   Page 5 of 30\nA.  Violations of the Court’s Order  \n  The plaintiffs have filed five previous motions to enforce the Agreement and to remedy the \nCity’s mismanagement of the service line replacement process.  The Court granted the most recent \nmotion to enforce on February 24, 2023 and ordered three remedies that are relevant here.  First, \nthe Court ordered the City to create a detailed written Service Line Replacement Plan describing \n“the  steps  the  City  will  take  to  complete  the  remaining  excavation  and  replacement  work \n(excluding restoration) required by the Agreement as quickly as practicable, and no later than \nAugust 1, 2023.”  5th Enforcement Order, ECF No. 258, PageID.11689.  The Court directed the \nCity to include a plan for “completing outreach as quickly as practicable and no later than March \n1, 2023.”   Id. at PageID.11690.  Second, the Court ordered the City to compile and provide to the \nplaintiffs an Excel spreadsheet no later than May 1, 2023 (1) listing all previously excavated \naddresses on the 2022 Replacement Eligible Homes List; and (2) indicating whether the City has \ncontemporaneous documentation that it completed restoration and the date of restoration, or \nwhether it has completed a visual inspection verifying that  \n(a) no asphalt, concrete, or other debris remains; (b) the address has a complete, \nuniform sidewalk with no gaps or holes, and the sidewalk is uniform in both grade \nand alignment; (c) the address has a complete, uniform driveway with no gaps or \nholes, and the driveway is uniform in both grade and alignment; (d) the address has \na complete, uniform curb, with no gaps or missing pieces, and the curb has a \nuniform grade and alignment; (e) the lawn is free of holes or trenches and is of a \nuniform grade, with no visible depressions; (f) any visible topsoil on the greenbelt \nor lawn is free of debris and the greenbelt or lawn has a consistent and uniform \nplant cover; and (g) the water shut-off valve is flush with the surface of the lawn \nand does not pose a tripping hazard. \n \nId. at PageID.11687; Stip. to Modify, ¶ 16.b, ECF No. 256, PageID.11625-27.  The parties agreed \nthat, no later than seven days after submitting this list, the City shall propose a deadline for \ncompleting  all  remaining  restoration  work  required  under  the  Settlement  Agreement.    5th \nEnforcement Order, ECF No. 258, PageID.11687.  Third, the Court directed the City to make a \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13128   Filed 03/12/24   Page 6 of 30\nmonthly report to the plaintiffs with an Excel spreadsheet listing all of the excavated properties \nwhere (1) the City completed and documented restoration, including the dates of restoration; (2) \nthe City has not completed restoration and does not need a visual inspection to confirm restoration \nstatus; and (3) the City has no record of restoration.  Id. at PageID.11695-96.  For properties \nlacking records, the Court ordered the City to indicate in the spreadsheet whether it has confirmed \nvia an in-person visual inspection that restoration was completed, or whether a visual inspection \nstill is needed.  Id. at PageID.11695-96.   \n  The plaintiffs now contend that the City has violated all three terms of the Court’s February \n24, 2023 order.   \n1.  Outreach \n  In the face of the City’s noncompliance, the parties repeatedly have agreed to modify the \ndeadline by which the City is required to complete outreach and replace eligible service lines.  In \nApril 2022, the City stipulated to complete all remaining excavations by September 30, 2022.  Apr. \n2022 Modification Order, ¶ 1, ECF No. 237, PageID.11071.  The parties agreed at that time that \nthe City had yet to make outreach to 1,369 homes to seek residents’ consent to a service line \nexcavation and replacement.  Apr. 2022 Stip. to Modify, ECF No. 236, PageID.11060.  The homes \nincluded those with active water accounts, and more than 700 addresses with inactive accounts \nthat the City agreed were eligible for service line replacement.  Sep. 2021 Emails, ECF No. 260-\n7, PageID.11888; Dec. 2021 Emails, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11890. \n  The City did not complete outreach to the 1,369 homes by September 30, 2022.  The \nplaintiffs moved again to enforce the settlement agreement, and the City stipulated in response to \na March 1, 2023 deadline for completing any remaining outreach.  5th Enforcement Order, ECF \nNo. 258, PageID.11690.  The City also failed to meet that deadline:  On April 28, 2023, it sent the \nplaintiffs a spreadsheet of all work orders “that still needed some sort of outreach,” dated April 23, \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13129   Filed 03/12/24   Page 7 of 30\n2023, that included 673 addresses that “were mistakenly excluded because at one point they did \nnot have active water accounts.”  Apr. 2023 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11979.  The City \nsuggested that it had completed outreach to most of these addresses the previous week by doubling \nthe number of outreach teams, which made 237 first and second attempts and 445 final attempts \nat outreach.  Ibid.  As of May 15, 2023, however, the City had not yet provided a report to the \nplaintiffs detailing the specific addresses to which it had made such outreach.  May 2023 Emails, \nECF No. 260-8, PageID.11952-53.  Moreover, the City allowed that it still was completing \noutreach to the addresses on its October and December 2022 outreach lists, indicating that it had \nyet to make weekend visits to 70 of 423 addresses on the October 2022 list and that it still needed \nto complete outreach to 28 of 104 addresses on the December 2022 list.  Apr. 2023 Emails, ECF \nNo. 260-8, PageID.11979.  The City stated that its outreach to the latter set of addresses had \nresulted in 47 completed service line replacements and five work declinations.  Ibid.   \n  In April, the City also began making weekly reports to the plaintiffs listing the total number \nof excavations, service line replacements, and consent outreach attempts made, and well as the \ntotal number of excavations and replacements scheduled for the next week and the total number \nof estimated replacements the City could perform based on the number of parts in its materials \ninventory.  The reports detail the following number of weekly outreach attempts: \nExhibit  Report Date  Final Consent Attempts  Consents Obtained \n37  April 12, 2023  12  3 \n38  April 19, 2023  8  21 \n39  April 26, 2023  445  14X (number illegible) \n40  May 3, 2023  50  10 \n43  May 10, 2023  0  0 \n41  May 17, 2023  TK  20 \n42  May 24, 2023  N/A  13 \n \nSee Status Reps., ECF No. 260-8, PageID.12020-35.  The City indicated in the May 17, 2023 \nreport  that  “[c]onsent  attempt  data  is  undergoing  final  quality  control  checks”  and  that  it \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13130   Filed 03/12/24   Page 8 of 30\n“anticipated that final, updated reporting on consent attempts will be available 05/1[ ]/2023.”  May \n17, 2023 Status Rep., ECF No. 260-8, PageID.12029 (date illegible).  In the final report, dated \nMay 24, 2023, the City indicated that “[c]onsent attempt work is complete.”  May 24, 2023 Status \nRep., ECF No. 260-8, PageID.12031.  Although some of the numbers in the emailed status reports \nare illegible (certain numbers and digits are missing throughout the plaintiffs’ exhibits, which came \nfrom the City), the plaintiffs represent that the City’s spring outreach attempts resulted in more \nthan 200 property owners consenting to service line checks.  Contempt Mot., ECF No. 260, \nPageID.11744.  However, the City’s reports suggest that many of those property owners lacked \nactive water accounts, and that no service line evaluations or replacements could be made at these \naddresses until the owners established active water accounts.  See, e.g., Apr. 26, 2023 Status Rep., \nECF No. 260-8, PageID.12025. \n  The plaintiffs asked Noah Attal, a data analyst, to complete a statistical analysis of the \noutreach data the City attached to its weekly reports.  Attal analyzed a spreadsheet dated May 14, \n2023 that included outreach attempts through March 20, 2023.  Attal decl., ECF No. 266-1, \nPageID.12725 n.2.  His analysis shows that, as of May 20, 2023, the City had not completed \noutreach to 306 addresses on its October 2022 Scope of Work List.  Id. at ¶ 13, PageID.12730-31.  \nAttal compiled a list of these addresses and attached it as an exhibit to his affidavit.  See Outreach \nWork Remaining as of June 2023, ECF No. 266-1, PageID.12740-46.  The list indicates that the \nCity completed some outreach to many of the 306 addresses, but it did not complete its outreach \nby making the required in-person attempts at the required times or by making the required \nmailings.  Ibid.; see also Attal decl., ¶ 13, ECF No. 266-1, PageID.12731 (categorizing remaining \noutreach). \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13131   Filed 03/12/24   Page 9 of 30\n  The plaintiffs blame the City’s failure to complete its outreach obligations by the March 1, \n2023  deadline  in  part  on  the  City’s  mismanagement  of  its  contractors,  Lakeshore  Global \nCorporation and ROWE Professional Services.  According to the plaintiffs, the City explained that \nit wrongly instructed its contractors not to complete outreach to homes that did not have active \nwater accounts, despite acknowledging that many of those homes were eligible for service line \nreplacement under the terms of the Agreement.  May 2023 Violations Notice, ECF No. 260-7, \nPageID.11923; Mar. 2022 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11975.  The City also explained that it \ndid not ensure that its contractors had the technological capacity to record the times that it \nattempted to make outreach, or to differentiate between consent and scheduling attempts, and that \nthe City therefore lacked complete reports of consent attempts performed during the fall of 2022.  \nMar.  2023  Emails,  ECF  No.  260-8,  PageID.11975-76;  Calero  decl.,  ¶  3,  ECF  No.  260-2, \nPageID.11765.   \n2.  Restoration \n  The City acknowledges that it did not meet the May 1, 2023 deadline for determining the \nscope of its remaining restoration work.  Resp., ECF No. 264, PageID.12071.  It blames inclement \nweather and ground cover in early 2023, which it says precluded it from visually observing lawns, \nroads, sidewalks, and driveways.  Ibid.  Although the City began conducting visual inspections in \nthe fall of 2022, it acknowledges that none of the inspections it completed prior to March 2023 \ncomplied with the visual inspection criteria set out in the parties’ January 19, 2023 stipulation and \nin the Court’s February 24, 2023 order.  Calero decl., ¶ 6, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11766; Apr. \n2023 Meet and Confer Request, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11948.  The City agreed that it would \nhave to redo at least 2,000 non-compliant visual inspections.  Apr. 2023 Meet and Confer Request, \nECF No. 260-8, PageID.11948.  On May 18, 2023, the City also informed the plaintiffs that it had \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13132   Filed 03/12/24   Page 10 of 30\ndecided to complete visual inspections at 11,000 additional addresses for which it had only hard-\ncopy records of possible restoration.  Calero decl., ¶ 6, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11766-67. \n  The City attached spreadsheets to its April and May weekly status reports listing the homes \nwith complete excavations where “no replacement was needed.”  See, e.g., May 17, 2023 Status \nRep., ECF No. 260-8, PageID.12029.  The spreadsheets are not in the record.  But plaintiffs’ \ncounsel states in a declaration that, based on her analysis of the spreadsheets, the City reported (1) \n5,452 addresses where it had completed visual inspections as of May 1, 2023; (2) 21,138 addresses \nwhere it had completed or still needed to complete a visual inspection between May 2, 2023 and \nMay 10, 2023; and (3) 26,590 addresses where it had completed or still needed to complete a visual \ninspection as of May 10, 2023.  Calero decl., ¶ 19, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11773; see also id. at \n¶¶ 15-18, PageID.11771-73 (describing the spreadsheets and data).  The City states in its response \nbrief that, as of June 14, 2023, it has completed 26,520 in-person visual inspections of addresses \nthat did not have a contemporaneous record of restoration, leaving about 500 inspections to \ncomplete.  Resp., ECF No. 264, PageID.12071.  It attached no documentation or affidavits in \nsupport of that assertion, but it represented that it would complete all remaining inspections and \nsupply compliant reporting to the plaintiffs by June 26, 2023.  Ibid. \n  Noah Attal also analyzed the scope of the City’s remaining restoration analysis obligations, \nusing data the City provided to the plaintiffs through June 21, 2023.  Attal decl., ¶ 15, ECF No. \n266-1, PageID.12731-32.  Attal found that the City had completed an excavation or replacement \nat 704 addresses for which it has not reported any restoration status.  Id. at ¶ 19, PageID.12734.  \nAttal also compiled an anonymized list of these addresses and attached it as an exhibit to his \naffidavit.  See Excavated Addresses Missing from June 2023 Restoration Reporting, ECF No. 266-\n1, PageID.12748. \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13133   Filed 03/12/24   Page 11 of 30\n  Mr. Attal also testified at the evidentiary hearing.  He explained that he is a master’s student \nin public policy and information science at the University of Michigan and worked as a data analyst \nat the University of Michigan School of Environment and Sustainability and at Safe Water \nEngineering, a consulting firm based in Detroit.  He stated that he has previous experience \nanalyzing municipal water data in these roles.   \n  Mr. Attal testified that he analyzed whether the June restoration reporting data was \ncomprehensive of all documented service line excavations.  To answer this question, he compiled \napproximately 40 files containing addresses where the City had conducted an excavation.  He then \nuploaded this list to ArcGIS, a software program that allowed him to geocode each address and fix \ndata errors, such as duplicate addresses or misspellings.  He used the same process for the City’s \nrestoration status data.  Finally, he compared the two lists and concluded that there were 704 \naddresses where the City had a record of a previous excavation but no record of restoration status.  \nThus, the plaintiffs and public were unable to evaluate for those parcels whether restoration was \nneeded.  Mr. Attal admitted that he had not independently determined whether any properties he \nidentified were commercial, vacant, demolished, uninhabitable, or duplexes.   \n  The plaintiffs blame the City’s mismanagement of its contractors for its mismanagement \nof its restoration work.  The City told the plaintiffs that it has no staff working on restoration \nreporting, but instead relies entirely on its contractor, ROWE, which it hired in April 2022 to \noversee service line exploration, replacement, and property restoration.  Calero decl., ¶ 4, ECF No. \n260-2, PageID.11765-66; ROWE Contract, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11957.  However, the City \ndid not inform ROWE of all of its reporting requirements, and ROWE only learned of all of the \nrelevant  reporting  obligations  in  March  2023,  when  the  plaintiffs  explained  to  ROWE  the \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13134   Filed 03/12/24   Page 12 of 30\nrestoration requirements detailed in the Court’s February 24, 2023 order.  Mar. 2022 Emails, ECF \nNo. 260-8, PageID.11975; Calero decl., ¶ 4, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11765-66. \n  At the hearing, the City presented one witness, Jeff Markstrom, who is the design services \nmanager at ROWE Professional Services Company.  The City contracts with ROWE to oversee \nservice line exploration, replacement, and property restoration.  Mr. Markstrom testified that he \noversees ROWE’s work and is the liaison between the firm and the City.  He also noted that the \nCity  has  a  contract  with  the  Lakeshore  Global  Corporation  (LGC)  to  perform  service  line \nreplacement, restoration, and outreach to residents.  He explained that ROWE staff collaborate \nwith teams in the field to make sure data about each site visit are inputted properly.   \n  Mr. Markstrom testified that restoration status site visits began in the Fall of 2022 and then \nbegan again “April-ish,” of 2023, at least a month after the March 1, 2023 outreach deadline in the \nCourt’s latest order.  Although he was aware of the City’s May 1 restoration status deadline, he \ncould not recall when he was informed of it.  He identified two principal justifications for the slow \nstart in the Spring.  First, he explained that city contractors could not be done while winter weather \nconditions persisted, because snow-covered ground might prevent crews from determining if \nrestoration had been completed.  Second, he testified that ROWE’s crews had to wait for the \nlanguage for the door hanger that was to be used as part of the outreach efforts to be approved.   \n  Mr. Markstrom testified that City officials informed him on May 10 that there were \nproperties his teams had previously visited that needed to be inspected again because the records \ndid not include all the information required by the Court’s February 2023 Order.  Initially, these \nsite visits were conducted by two staff members from ROWE, but six to eight two-person teams \neventually were participating in the work.  He testified that this staffing increase occurred after \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13135   Filed 03/12/24   Page 13 of 30\nMay 1.  Mr. Markstrom estimated that crews could conduct approximately 120 to 140 inspections \nper day.  \n  Mr. Markstrom also explained that he had reviewed approximately ten of the 704 addresses \nnoted  in  Mr.  Attal’s  report  and  identified  some  with  inactive  water  accounts  or  that  were \nabandoned homes.  However, he admitted that restoration could be completed at properties with \ninactive water accounts.   \n  On July 21, 2023, nearly a month after the hearing, the City filed an affidavit from Mr. \nMarkstrom (ECF No. 274-1) stating that he had reviewed the plaintiffs’ list of 704 properties and \nfound:  \n-  102 addresses where visual inspections had already been completed.  Mr. \nMarkstrom noted that addresses in this category were frequently duplexes, had \na misspelling, or an improper address type (e.g., DR instead of CT). \n-  582 addresses where visual inspections were still required  \n-  20 addresses that were invalid or were vacant parcels \nHe stated that the City completed visual inspections of the 582 relevant addresses as of July 7.   \n3.  Reporting \n  As noted above, the City indicated that it would provide a compliant list of all of the \nproperties  where  it  has  completed  visual  restoration  inspections  by  June  26,  2023.    The \nspreadsheets the City provided to the plaintiffs apparently did not comply with the Court’s \nFebruary 24, 2023 order.  The City did not provide any spreadsheets to the plaintiffs until May 1, \n2023.  Calero decl., ¶ 11, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11769; Mar. 2022 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, \nPageID.11975-76.  And the spreadsheets provided thereafter did not comply with the ordered \nformatting requirements.  According to the plaintiffs, the spreadsheets were missing data for \nthousands of addresses, did not appear to list any addresses where the City had contemporaneous \ndocumentation that restoration is complete, and did not clearly distinguish between addresses \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13136   Filed 03/12/24   Page 14 of 30\nwhere the City had completed inspections and still needed to complete inspections.

The plaintiffs also say that the City \nfailed to ensure that ROWE had the technological capability to export restoration data in Excel \nformat until March 2023 and failed to keep ROWE informed of the City’s reporting obligations \npursuant to the Court’s orders.  Mar. 2022 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11975; Calero decl., ¶ \n4,  ECF  No.  260-2,  PageID.11765-66.    Mr.  Markstrom’s  hearing  testimony  confirmed  that \nallegation as well. \nB.  Mayor Neely \n  Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley is not a party to this lawsuit or to the Settlement Agreement.  \nThe plaintiffs did not name him as a defendant because the City was under the governance of a \nstate emergency manager when they filed their original complaint.  However, the mayor’s \nauthority since has been restored, and the mayor once again serves as the “Chief Executive Officer” \nof the City of Flint.  City Charter, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11836.  As such, he is responsible for \ntaking “care that the laws shall be enforced,” including by making recommendations to the City \nCouncil, ibid., reviewing or vetoing every City Council resolution, id. at PageID.11834-35, and \nsubmitting an annual budget, id. at PageID.11837.  He also is responsible for appointing the City \nAdministrator and other executive staff.  Id. at PageID.11836. \n  Mayor Neeley also effectively serves as the chief spokesperson for the City of Flint, \nincluding for its service line replacement efforts.  He provides updates at public meetings about \nthe status of the City’s replacement work and routinely makes comments to the press.  In the fall \nof 2022, he committed to “continue the work” of pipe replacement “until the work is done,” \npromising that he would “work with anyone who is committed to making that happen” and asking \nthe “remaining homeowners to give our crews the right of entry so we can fix this once and for \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13137   Filed 03/12/24   Page 15 of 30\nall.”  Nov. 2022 City Press Release, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11843.  He has also admitted that \n“[d]eadlines were set and deadlines were missed,” and taken personal responsibility for that fact.  \nSee May 2023 Scripps Article, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11853 (“Some could be attributed to \nme. . . .”).  And he has acknowledged that the City has struggled to pin down what work remains, \nwhile nevertheless insisting that the City “will not rush through this process just to say we got it \ndone.”  Id. at PageID.11852. \nC.  Proceedings on the Contempt Motion \n  The plaintiffs notified the City in February, March, April, and May 2023 that it had violated \nCourt’s February 24, 2023 enforcement order.  See Feb. 2023 Violation Notice, ECF No. 260-8, \nPageID.12016-17; Mar. 2023 Violation Notice, ECF No. 260-7, PageID.11938; Apr. 2023 Meet \nand Confer Request, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11946-48; May 2023 Violation Notice, ECF No. \n260-7, PageID.11922-23.  Counsel met and conferred to discuss the violations on May 12 and 18, \n2023, but did not come to an agreement to resolve them.  See Calero decl., ¶¶ 5-7, ECF No. 260-\n2, PageID.11766-67.  Accordingly, on May 26, 2023, the plaintiffs filed the instant contempt \nmotion.  See ECF No. 260.   \n  The Court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for contempt on June 30, 2023.  At the \nclose of the hearing, the Court ordered both parties to file post-hearing supplemental briefing.  On \nJuly 27, the Court ordered the plaintiffs to file a reply brief in light of the City’s representation that \nit had complied with its obligations.   \n  On November 1, 2023, the plaintiffs sought leave to submit supplemental evidence.  The \ndefendants filed a response in opposition on November 14, 2023.  The Court ultimately granted \nthe plaintiffs’ request.  ECF No. 279.   \n  The documents most recently submitted by the plaintiffs principally concern the City’s \nfailure to meet the Court’s August 1, 2023 deadline by which it was to complete all service line \n- 15 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13138   Filed 03/12/24   Page 16 of 30\nexcavations and replacements.  See ECF No. 258, PageID.11684.  On August 16, 2023, the City \nnotified the plaintiffs of its determination that it had completed all excavations and replacements \nrequired by the Settlement Agreement.  ECF No. 277-1, PageID.13096.  However, the plaintiffs \nresponded that the City had failed to provide adequate documentation to support this determination \nand that the documentation that was provided actually undermined the City’s position.  Over the \nnext two months, the parties engaged in detailed correspondence about the scope of the outstanding \nwork and, as of November 1, 2023, it appears that the remaining dispute centers on the status of \nreplacement work at 184 addresses.  ECF No. 277-1, PageID.13085.  Of these, the plaintiffs assert \nthat there are 106 addresses where a resident consented to excavation and there are no records of \nthat work being completed or full scheduling attempts made and 20 addresses where the City’s \nrecords  indicate  that  a  lead  or  galvanized  steel  pipe  was  found  but  contain  no  record  of \nreplacement.    The  remaining  58  are  addresses  where  the  City  reported  an  excavation  but \ninformation on service line composition or replacement status is lacking.  Id. at PageID.13103-04.  \nFor its part, the City asserts that the work at the majority of these addresses is complete under the \nterms of the Settlement Agreement.  However, it appears to concede that scheduling outreach \nremains to be completed at 60 addresses.  Id. at PageID.13085.   \nII.  Discussion \nA.  Contempt Finding \n  The plaintiffs request that the Court impose sanctions to remedy the City’s ongoing \nviolations of the Agreement, as modified by the Court’s February 24, 2023 enforcement order.  \nThey argue that they have satisfied their burden by demonstrating that the City has failed to comply \nwith clearly ordered outreach, restoration, and reporting requirements.  And they contend that the \nCity cannot show categorically and in detail its inability to comply with the Agreement, because \n- 16 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13139   Filed 03/12/24   Page 17 of 30\nthe City repeatedly took actions at odds with the Agreement, and did so despite the plaintiffs \nrepeatedly informing the City of its outstanding obligations.   \n  The City responds that civil contempt is not warranted because it is not meant to be punitive \nand should merely coerce future compliance.  Such coercion is unnecessary where compliance has \nbeen achieved, they insist.  First, the defendants contend that there is no remaining dispute that all \noutreach has been completed to homes on the 2022 Replacement Eligible Homes List as of June \n22, 2023.  Next, the defendants seek to contextualize the 704 addresses missing restoration \nreporting, noting that they had completed 26,679 visual inspections as of the date of the hearing.  \nThe defendants argue that 582 addresses they concede required inspection represent just over two \npercent of the total.  They maintain that this amount is not indicative of neglect and state that \ninspections at these addresses are complete as of July 7.  Finally, they argue that they have taken \nall reasonable efforts to comply with the Court’s orders.  Their argument on this point offers few \nspecifics.  Rather, they list the work completed so far and its cost.   \n  One thing is certain: the City did not comply with the latest Court order that detailed the \nremaining procedures and extended deadlines for compliance.  There is another certainty: the \n“power of courts to punish for contempts is a necessary and integral part of the independence of \nthe judiciary, and is absolutely essential to the performance of the duties imposed on them by law.”  \nN.L.R.B. v. Cincinnati Bronze, Inc., 829 F.2d 585, 590-91 (6th Cir. 1987) (quoting Gompers v. \nBuck’s Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 450 (1911)); Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, \n370 (1966) (“There can be no question that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with \ntheir lawful orders through civil contempt.”).  “Contempt proceedings enforce the message that \ncourt orders and judgments are to be complied with in a prompt manner.”  Elec. Workers Pension \nTr. Fund of Local Union #58, IBEW v. Gary’s Elec. Serv. Co., 340 F.3d 373, 378 (6th Cir. 2003).  \n- 17 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13140   Filed 03/12/24   Page 18 of 30\n“A litigant may be held in contempt if his adversary shows by clear and convincing evidence that \nhe violated a definite and specific order of the court requiring him to perform or refrain from \nperforming a particular act or acts with knowledge of the court’s order.”  Cincinnati Bronze, 829 \nF.2d at 591 (internal quotation omitted).   \n  “Clear and convincing evidence is a not a light burden and should not be confused with the \nless stringent, proof by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 379 \n(citation omitted).  But “[o]nce the movant establishes his prima facie case, the burden shifts to \nthe contemnor who may defend by coming forward with evidence showing that he is presently \nunable to comply with the court’s order.”  Ibid. (citing United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752, \n757 (1983)).  “To meet this production burden in this circuit ‘a defendant must show categorically \nand in detail why he or she is unable to comply with the court’s order.’”  Ibid. (quoting Rolex \nWatch U.S.A., Inc. v. Crowley, 74 F.3d 716, 720 (6th Cir. 1996)).  A “good faith effort” is \ninsufficient.  Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703, 708 (6th Cir. 1991).  Rather, the contemnor must \nshow that it “took all reasonable steps within [its] power to comply.”  Ibid. (quoting Peppers v. \nBarry, 873 F.2d 967, 969 (6th Cir. 1989)).   \n  Contempt “is . . . reserved for those who ‘fully understand[]’ the meaning of a court order \nand yet ‘choose[] to ignore its mandate.’”  Gascho v. Glob. Fitness Holdings, LLC, 875 F.3d 795, \n800 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, Loc. 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade \nAss’n, 389 U.S. 64, 76 (1967)).  As described above, there is ample evidence that the City’s \nconduct fits that reservation.  It is undisputed that the City missed the Court-ordered deadlines for \ncompleting outreach to service line replacement eligible homes and for assessing the scope of its \nremaining restoration work.  There is clear and convincing evidence that the City violated definite \nand specific provisions of the Agreement and February 24, 2023 order. \n- 18 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13141   Filed 03/12/24   Page 19 of 30\n  The City effectively suggests that the plaintiffs’ motion should be denied as moot because \nit has completed the ordered outreach and restoration assessments.  However, the “mere fact that \na party may have taken steps toward achieving compliance is not a defense to a contempt charge.”  \nSizzler Fam. Steak Houses v. W. Sizzlin Steak House, Inc., 793 F.2d 1529, 1535 n.5 (11th Cir. \n1986).   \n  Despite remaining questions about whether the City has completed all required outreach, \nsee ECF No. 277-1, PageID.13085, it now appears that the City has now complied with many of \nthe items raised in the plaintiffs’ contempt motion.  The City has complied with the Court’s orders \nby completing all required outreach at 313 addresses of concern to the plaintiffs, see Stip., ECF \nNo. 269, PageID.12768, and all required visual inspections, see Markstrom Decl., ECF No. 274, \nPageID.13043.  Nevertheless, the City may still be found in contempt for its earlier violations.  \nThe City is correct that civil contempt is meant to be remedial and not punitive, see United States \nv. Work Wear Corp., 602 F.2d 110, 115 (6th Cir. 1979), but courts regularly find parties in civil \ncontempt, even when they have complied with a court order after the initiation of contempt \nproceedings.  This is possible because there is a distinction between the finding of contempt and \nthe sanctions for the violation, which may be either coercive or compensatory.   See, e.g., Masco \nCorp. of Indiana v. Delta Imports LLC, No. 11-14720, 2013 WL 5816525, at *1-2 (E.D. Mich. \nOct. 29, 2023) (finding contempt and awarding attorney’s fees in enforcing consent judgment even \nthough defendant had purged itself of the contempt); Benjamin v. Sielaff, 752 F. Supp 140, 147-\n48 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (analyzing contempt and sanctions separately); Walpole Woodworkers, Inc. v. \nAtlas Fencing, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 247, 254-55 (D. Conn. 2002) (finding defendant in contempt \nbut imposing no sanctions because of compliance).  While a coercive remedy may be inappropriate \n- 19 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13142   Filed 03/12/24   Page 20 of 30\nafter compliance has been achieved, a compensatory remedy may be necessary.  See Masco Corp., \n2013 WL 5816525, at *2 (awarding compensatory sanctions).   \n  Because the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof, the burden shifts to the City to \ndemonstrate that it is unable to comply with the Court’s orders.  Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 379.  \nThe  City  has  not  made  that  showing  with  regard  to  its  outreach,  restoration,  or  reporting \nobligations.  It has not even attempted to demonstrate that it “took all reasonable steps within [its] \npower to comply with” the Court’s February 24, 2023 order, Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 379 \n(quoting Peppers v. Barry, 873 F.2d 967, 969 (6th Cir. 1989)), let alone that it made any effort to \nmarshal resources, assert authority, or “demand the results needed” to comply, Glover, 934 F.2d \nat 708 (quoting Aspira of New York, Inc. v. Bd. of Educ. of New York, 423 F. Supp. 647, 654 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1976)).  To the contrary, the City acknowledges that it made significant efforts to \ncomply with the order only after the relevant deadlines has passed.  See Resp., ECF No. 264, \nPageID.12070-71; Calero decl., ¶¶ 4-11, ECF No. 260-2, PageID.11765-69; Apr. 2023 Emails, \nECF No. 260-8, PageID.11979; May 2023 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11952.   \n  The City’s two principal justifications for the delay — winter weather and preparations for \nthe doorhanger — are unpersuasive.  First, winter weather cannot explain the City’s failure to \nperform outreach to homes eligible for service line replacement by March 1, 2023.  Although Mr. \nMarkstrom testified about the difficulties conducting compliant visual inspections and restoration \nwork during winter weather, the City provided no evidence that winter weather actually inhibited \noutreach activities.   And the City conducted at least some outreach in December 2022, suggesting \nthat it was possible to do so in all seasons.  See Apr. 2023 Emails, ECF No. 260-8, PageID.11979.  \n  Winter weather may partially explain a delay in conducting site visits.  Certainly, it is \nchallenging to determine whether a property needs restoration if it is covered in snow.  But again, \n- 20 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13143   Filed 03/12/24   Page 21 of 30\nthe City has failed to meet its burden of showing it “took all reasonable steps” to comply.  Gary’s \nElectric, 340 F.3d at 379.  The City provided no evidence about snow cover in Flint during the \nrelevant months.  And when site inspections did begin, Mr. Markstrom testified that ROWE did \nnot increase its staffing until May 1, after the Court’s deadline.  At peak, there were approximately \nsix to eight crews working, who could evaluate 120 to 140 houses a day.  Had City officials been \nready to proceed at that capacity in early March, the City would have had sufficient time to comply \nwith the Court’s May 1 deadline.  The City knew how many properties required visual inspections, \nand it knew how much time it had to complete these inspections, yet it has failed to show why \nthese could not completed by May 1.   \n  Likewise, the delay in approval for doorhanger text does not explain adequately the City’s \nfailure to meet its deadlines.   The parties agreed to the doorhanger text ahead of schedule.  Notice \n& Stip. ¶¶ 1-4, ECF No. 272, PageID.12910.  And doorhangers were not required for the outreach \nactivities.  Mr. Markstrom provided no specific explanation about how the doorhanger approval \nprocess delayed outreach work.  An issue with the printing company might justify a delay, but the \nCity has provided no further evidence and the Court cannot speculate.  The defendant must \ndemonstrate “categorically and in detail why he or she is unable to comply with the court’s order.”  \nRolex Watch, 74 F.3d at 720.   This explanation is not sufficiently detailed.  \n  Finally, the City attempts to contextualize its belated compliance, listing its achievements \nthus far.  The City has undoubtedly completed much of what the Settlement Agreement and the \nCourt has required.  But that does not excuse its missed deadlines.  If the Court’s deadlines were \nunfeasible, the proper path would have been for the City to seek a modification.  The City never \ndid that.  Instead, deadlines came and went with little note.  The defendants did not ultimately \ncomplete their required tasks until after the Court’s June 2023 hearing.  Cases that excuse \n- 21 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13144   Filed 03/12/24   Page 22 of 30\nnoncompliance with court orders on the ground of “substantial compliance” still require the party \nto have taken “all reasonable steps” to comply.  See, e.g., Peppers v. Barry, 873 F.2d 967, 969 (6th \nCir. 1989); Satyam Computer Servs. Ltd. v. Venture Global Eng’g, LLC, 323 F. App’x 421, 430 \n(6th Cir. 2009).  “Good faith is not a defense to civil contempt,” and “diligence alone does not \nsatisfy” a contemnor’s burden of production.  Glover, 934 F.2d at 708 (quoting Fortin v. Comm’r \nof Mass. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 796-97 (1st Cir. 1982)).  Here, it is undisputed that \nthe City “repeatedly ignored the court’s orders and acted only after contempt proceedings were \nthreatened.”  Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit has found that similarly-belated compliance efforts fell “far \nshort of the required diligence” necessary to establish that a party has taken “all reasonable steps \nto comply” with a court’s order.  Ibid.  In Glover v. Johnson, the court of appeals cited approvingly \na district court’s finding of contempt where public officials “allowed deadlines to pass without \nadvance announcements or volunteered explanations, awaiting complaints by the plaintiffs before \neven treating with the court concerning delinquencies”; bore “with seeming equanimity long \nperiods of nonperformance, inadequate performance, or outright defiance from key constituents”; \nand “displayed an evident sense of nonurgency bordering on indifference, contrasting vividly with \nthe spurt of activity on the [heels] of plaintiffs’ motion for a finding of contempt.”  Ibid. (quoting \nAspira, 423 F. Supp. at 654).  The same findings are evident in the present case, and the City again \nappears to have made genuine efforts toward compliance only when the plaintiffs spurred it on by \nfiling their sixth motion to enforce the Agreement.  See, e.g., Concerned Pastors for Soc. Action \nv. Khouri, 658 F. Supp. 3d 495, 503-04 (E.D. Mich. 2023) (Lawson, J.); 4th Enforcement Order, \nECF No. 228, PageID.11030-42.   \n- 22 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13145   Filed 03/12/24   Page 23 of 30\n  The City did not take all reasonable steps within its power to comply with the Court’s \nOrder.  The City has not met its burden of showing an inability to comply with the Court’s orders.  \nThe City is in contempt of the Court’s clear and unambiguous February 24, 2023 order.   \nB.  Mayor Neely \n  The same cannot be said for Mayor Neely.  It is true that under “[w]ell settled law,” non-\nparty corporate officers may be held in contempt when the corporations they lead fail to comply \nwith federal court orders.  Gascho, 875 F.3d at 803 (quoting Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 380).  \nAnd “because a civil contempt ruling either attempts to coerce compliance or compensate the \ncomplainant for losses, it is fully appropriate to impose judicial sanctions on the nonparty corporate \nofficer.”  Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 383.  Nonetheless, two conditions must be met for a district \ncourt to have the authority to hold a non-party officer in contempt.  First, the officer must have \nnotice of the Court’s order or injunction and its contents.  Gascho, 875 F.3d at 803 (citing Gary’s \nElectric, 340 F.3d at 380).  Second, the officer must be “responsible for the corporation’s conduct” \nand have “failed to take appropriate action to ensure performance.”  Ibid. (citing Gary’s Electric, \n340 F.3d at 382); see also Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 376 (1911) (holding that corporate \nofficers who are “apprised of the writ directed to the corporation, prevent compliance or fail to \ntake appropriate action within their power for the performance of the corporate duty,” may be \nfound “no less than the corporation itself . . . guilty of disobedience, and may be punished for \ncontempt.”).   \n  As “Chief Executive Officer” of the City of Flint, Mayor Neeley is “subject to the court’s \norder just as the [City] itself was.”  Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 382.  And the City does not dispute \nthat Mayor Neeley had notice of the Court’s February 24, 2023 order and its requirements.  \nHowever,  the  plaintiffs  have  not  demonstrated  that  Mayor  Neeley  himself  failed  to  take \nappropriate action to ensure compliance with the extended deadlines.  They have not supplied any \n- 23 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13146   Filed 03/12/24   Page 24 of 30\nevidence that demonstrates that Mayor Neeley himself took any actions that prevented the City \nfrom completing its outreach or restoration-assessment obligations, or failed to take any actions \nwithin his power to ensure performance.   \n  The parties speculate that Mayor Neeley could have done more to supervise contractors \nand City staff.  But they do not point to anything in the record establishing that Mayor Neeley \nfailed to do either of these things or failed to do them adequately.  The plaintiffs’ conclusory \nstatements fall far short of the “clear and convincing” evidence required to hold Mayor Neeley in \ncontempt of court.  See Gary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 382 (applying the clear and convincing \nevidence standard to a non-party corporate executive); Consolidation Coal Co. v. Loc. Union No. \n1784, United Mine Workers of Am., 514 F.2d 763, 766 (6th Cir. 1975) (“[T]he petitioner in a civil \ncontempt proceeding must overcome a heavy burden of proof.”).   \n  The plaintiffs have not established a prima facie case for holding Mayor Neeley in \ncontempt of court. \nC.  Remedy \n  In its initial response to the contempt motion, the City contended that sanctions would not \nbe necessary or warranted because it would fully comply with the Court’s prior orders by the \nhearing date on the contempt motion.  It didn’t.  In its July 2023 supplemental filing, the City \nargued that it has taken all reasonable efforts to comply with the Court’s orders.  But its argument \non this point offers few specifics.  Rather, it listed the work completed so far and its cost.  The \nCity represented that there were only 19 service line excavations remaining as of July 19 and that \nit anticipated meeting its August 1 deadline to complete service line replacement.  ECF No. 274, \nPageID.13039.  It reasoned that because there would be no future acts left to coerce, the relief the \nplaintiffs seek is moot.   \n- 24 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13147   Filed 03/12/24   Page 25 of 30\n  As noted above the Court has the authority to order sanctions for contempts, even after a \nparty has complied with the Court’s order, but the plaintiffs’ November 2023 filing indicated that \nthe City still had not complied with all the requirements of the Settlement Agreement.  The \nplaintiffs’ sought-after remedies are not moot.     \n  A court may impose coercive or compensatory sanctions as a civil contempt remedy.  \nGary’s Electric, 340 F.3d at 379 (citing United States v. United Mine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. \n258, 303-04 (1947)); see also Work Wear Corp., 602 F.2d at 115 (“Civil contempt is meant to be \nremedial and to benefit the complainant either by coercing the defendant to comply with the \nCourt’s order via a conditional fine or sentence or by compensating the complainant for any injury \ncaused by the defendant’s disobedience.”).  The plaintiffs have asked the Court to impose a $500 \nfine for each day that the City has failed to comply with the latest order.  A contempt fine “is \nconsidered civil and remedial if it either ‘coerce[s] the defendant into compliance with the court’s \norder, [or] . . . compensate[s] the complainant for losses sustained.’” Int’l Union, United Mine \nWorkers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 829 (1994) (quoting Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 303-\n04).  The proposed $500 daily fine is coercive because it is intended to incentivize the City to \ncomply with the order, and it is avoidable by complying with the February 24, 2023 order.   \n  However, considering the City’s post-hearing efforts, as belated as they were, a daily fine \nis no longer appropriate, as the plaintiffs now acknowledge.  See ECF No. 276, PageID.13049.  \nThere also are prudential reasons for declining to impose a daily fine due to the financial condition \nof the City.  “[I]t is necessary in fixing the amount of a coercive fine to consider the defendants’ \nfinancial resources and consequent burden the fines place on the particular defendants.”  United \nStates v. Pro. Air Traffic Controllers Org. (PATCO), 525 F. Supp. 820, 822 (E.D. Mich. 1981); \nsee also Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 304 (holding that a “court which has returned a conviction for \n- 25 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13148   Filed 03/12/24   Page 26 of 30\ncontempt must, in fixing the amount of a fine to be imposed as a punishment or as a means of \nsecuring future compliance, consider the amount of defendant’s financial resources and the \nconsequent seriousness of the burden to that particular defendant”).  In light of the City’s previous \narguments that it lacks sufficient funds to complete the pipeline replacement program, a coercive \nfine at the present time is not warranted.   \n  The plaintiffs also ask the Court to modify the Settlement Agreement in a way that would \nallow them to seek attorney’s fees if they must seek the Court’s assistance in the future to secure \ncompliance.  The plaintiffs acknowledge that they agreed to limit attorney’s fees when they entered \nthe Settlement Agreement, which precludes them from seeking fees related to enforcement.  They \nargue, however, that if they must bring future enforcement actions, the threat of additional attorney \nfees would deter the City from continuing to violate the Agreement.    \n  The Settlement Agreement required the “State Parties” to pay $895,000 in litigation costs, \nwhich included attorneys’ fees and expert expenses.  That payment was to “satisfy any claim by \nPlaintiffs to litigation costs (including attorneys’ fees and expert costs) incurred in this Case and \nincurred in enforcing this Agreement through the Termination Date.”  Settlement Agreement, ¶¶ \n123-24, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7422-23.  The “Termination Date” is defined as the later of the \ndate that the Government Parties completed their obligations under the Health Programs section \nof the Agreement or one year after all the service lines are replaced.  Id., ¶ 2(ee), PageID.7362.  \nThe service line replacement deadline under the Agreement was to be January 1, 2020,  id., ¶ 20(c), \nPageID.7370-71.  The City failed to meet that deadline, and it was extended to August 1, 2023, \nsee ECF No. 258, PageID.11684.  The City had not met the extended deadline as of November \n2023.   \n- 26 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13149   Filed 03/12/24   Page 27 of 30\n  Nonetheless, modifying a Settlement Agreement, especially one that has been approved by \nthe Court, is no small task.  The Settlement Agreement entered by the parties in this case operates \nas a consent decree — that is, a “settlement agreement subject to continued judicial policing.”  \nVanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013, 1017 (6th Cir. 1994) (quoting Williams \nv. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983)).  A consent decree is “a strange hybrid in the law,” \nLorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., 979 F.2d 1141, 1148 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting Brown v. \nNeeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir. 1981)), in that it is “at once ‘a voluntary settlement agreement \nwhich could be fully effective without judicial intervention’ and ‘a final judicial order . . . plac[ing] \nthe power and prestige of the court behind the compromise struck by the parties,’” ibid. (quoting \nWilliams, 720 F.2d at 920).  Consent decrees therefore “may be ‘treated as contracts for some \npurposes but not for others.’”  Ibid. (quoting United States v. ITT Continental Baking, 420 U.S. \n223, 236 n.10 (1975).  It follows that a consent decree also “should be construed to preserve the \nposition for which the parties bargained.”  Vanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Vogel v. City of \nCincinnati, 959 F.2d 594, 598 (6th Cir. 1992)).   \n  A court has the inherent power to enforce “to modify a consent decree if satisfied that the \ndecree ‘has been turned through changing circumstances into an instrument of wrong.’”  Waste \nMgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 F.3d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States \nv. Knote, 29 F.3d 1297, 1302 (8th Cir. 1994)).  This power arises from the “injunctive quality of a \nconsent decree,” which “compels the approving court to . . . modify the decree if ‘changed \ncircumstances’ subvert its intended purpose.”  Vanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Williams, 720 \nF.2d at 920).  Even though the City’s performance of its obligations under the Settlement \nAgreement has been woefully dilatory, and the delay in replacing the service lines impacts the \nhealth and welfare of the community, it cannot be said that the Agreement has been transformed \n- 27 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13150   Filed 03/12/24   Page 28 of 30\nthereby into “an instrument of wrong,” at least not to the extent that would justify a blanket \napproval for additional attorney’s fees for future enforcement efforts.   \n  However, that does not mean that an award of attorney’s fees apart from the Agreement is \nprohibited as a compensatory sanction for the City’s contempt.  Although the Court declines to \nmodify the Settlement Agreement to clear the way for future attorney’s fee requests, the Court still \nmay fashion some kind of equitable relief for the plaintiffs.  “Where a consent decree is violated, \nthe court should fashion equitable relief that is ‘designed to make the party whole for his or her \nloss.’”  Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 F.3d 523, 533 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Cook v. City of \nChicago, 192 F.3d 693, 695 (7th Cir. 1999)).  The cost of bringing the violation of the Court \nFebruary 24, 2023 order “to the attention of the court is part of the damages suffered by” the \nplaintiffs and typically would warrant “[a]t a minimum” the recovery of “fees and costs.”  Inst. of \nCetacean Rsch. v. Sea Shepherd Conservation Soc’y, 774 F.3d 935, 959 (9th Cir. 2014).  And it is \n“well recognized” that “[c]ourts have inherent authority to enforce their judicial orders and decrees \nin cases of civil contempt by assessing attorneys’ fees.”  Liberis v. Craig, 845 F.2d 326, 1988 WL \n37450, at *5 (6th Cir. 1988) (table); see also Nicole Gas Prod., Ltd., 916 F.3d 566, 579 (6th Cir. \n2019) (affirming fee award as sanction for contempt finding); Inst. of Cetacean Rsch., 774 F.3d at \n958 (“[T]he cost of bringing the violation to the attention of the court is part of the damages \nsuffered  by  the  prevailing  party.”  (quotation  marks  omitted)).    Thus,  the  Court  may  order \n“equitable relief that is compensatory in nature” by awarding the plaintiffs attorney’s fees now, to \ncompensate the plaintiffs for the cost of bringing the instant action.  Shy, 701 F.3d at 533; see also \nInst. of Cetacean Rsch., 774 F.3d at 959.  “An award of attorney’s fees and expense is among the \n‘appropriate’ equitable remedies for a successful moving party ‘in a civil contempt proceeding.’”  \nCernelle v. Graminex, L.L.C., 539 F. Supp. 3d 728, 738 (E.D. Mich. 2021), aff’d, No. 21-1579, \n- 28 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13151   Filed 03/12/24   Page 29 of 30\n2022 WL 2759867 (6th Cir. July 14, 2022); see TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 F.2d 1261, \n1273 (6th Cir. 1983) (citing Chas. Pfizer & Co. v. Davis-Edwards Pharmacal Corp., 385 F.2d 533, \n538 (2d Cir. 1967)); see also McMahan & Co. v. Po Folks, Inc., 206 F.3d 627, 634 (6th Cir. 2000) \n(“An award of attorney’s fees is appropriate for civil contempt in situations where court orders \nhave been violated.”) (citing Redken Lab., Inc. v. Levin, 843 F.2d 226 (6th Cir. 1988)).    \n  The plaintiffs have not asked for compensatory attorney’s fees in any specific amount.  The \namount of the award must be “reasonable,” generally as measured by the lodestar method.  Ne. \nOhio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 831 F.3d 686, 702 (6th Cir. 2016).  That method calls for \nmultiplying “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable \nhourly rate.” Ibid. (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)).   \n  The Court will permit the plaintiffs to submit their requests for reasonable attorney’s fees \nincurred in seeking the enforcement of the February 24, 2023 order.   \nIII.  Conclusion \n  Nearly seven years after entering the Settlement Agreement, it appears that the City still \nhas not completed the service line replacement program.  The evidence presented at the hearing \ndemonstrated  that  the  City  had  outstanding  outreach,  restoration  assessment,  and  reporting \nobligations well after the deadlines imposed by the Court’s February 24, 2023 Order.  The City \nhas not complied with the Court’s order, and it has not met its burden of showing an inability to \ncomply.   \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ motion for contempt (ECF No. 260) is  \nGRANTED IN PART.   \n  It  is  further  ORDERED  AND  ADJUDGED  that  the  City  of  Flint  is  in  CIVIL \nCONTEMPT of the Court’s February 24, 2023 order.   \n- 29 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 280, PageID.13152   Filed 03/12/24   Page 30 of 30\n  It is further ORDERED that as a remedy for the City’s contempt, the plaintiffs may recover \ntheir attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses (including expert witness expenses) incurred in bringing \nits motion for contempt and the ensuing proceedings.  \n  It is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs may apply for the award of expenses by filing \nan appropriate motion with proper documentation of fees, costs, and expenses on or before April \n1, 2024.   \n  It is further ORDERED that the motion is DENIED in all other respects. \n    s/David M.

For purposes of this \nSection (Section IV) only, a “replacement eligible household” is a household that \nhas an active water account as of the Effective Date, irrespective of any water shut-\n13 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 18 of 92    Pg ID 7366\noffs that may occur after the Effective Date.  \n12.  Replacement eligible households shall not include abandoned \nhouseholds. A household is abandoned for purposes of this Agreement if it meets \nthe definition of “Abandoned Property” set forth in section 24-109 of the Flint, \nMichigan Code of Ordinances, as of the Effective Date.  \n13.  The City shall maintain a list of households it determines are \nabandoned and that would otherwise be eligible for service line replacement \n(“Abandoned Homes List”). If a resident activates a new water account at any time \nwithin 18 months of the Effective Date or prior to the Year 3 Cutoff Date, \nwhichever is later, the City shall determine whether the address is on the \nAbandoned Homes List. If the address is on the Abandoned Homes list, the City \nshall undertake reasonable efforts to obtain permission from the account holder to \nreplace the service line. Reasonable efforts shall include sending at least two \nwritten requests. If permission is granted, the City shall replace the service line at \nno cost to the new property owner within the timeline described in Paragraph 20. \n14.

Reasonable efforts shall include sending at least two \n14 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 19 of 92    Pg ID 7367\nwritten requests. If permission is granted, the City shall replace the service line at \nno cost to the new property owner within the timeline described in Paragraph 20. If \na new water account is activated more than 18 months after the Effective Date or \nafter the Year 3 Cutoff Date, whichever is later, the City must send a written notice \nto the new account holder, informing the account holder that the household’s \nservice line material was not verified during City-wide service line excavation and \nreplacement in 2017 through 2020, and that the service line may contain lead or \ngalvanized steel. \n15.  Efforts to obtain permission for replacement at eligible households. \nThe City shall undertake reasonable efforts to contact property owners of \nproperties upon which replacement eligible households are located to obtain \npermission to replace the portions of service lines that lie beneath private property. \nTo the extent that the resident of a replacement eligible household is a different \nperson from the property owner, and if access to the household is necessary to \nconduct excavation or replacement, then the City shall also undertake reasonable \nefforts to contact the resident to obtain permission to replace the service line.  \na.  For purposes of Paragraph 15, reasonable efforts shall include, \nfor those replacement eligible households at which an initial \nattempt to obtain permission by making in-person contact with \nthe property owner at the household was unsuccessful, sending \n15 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 20 of 92    Pg ID 7368\nat least 2 written requests, by U.S. mail, to property owners at \nthe most recent mailing address identified through city records, \nfor permission to replace the service line at that household. The \nCity shall keep records that show the dates on which such \nwritten requests were sent, the address of the replacement \neligible household, and the address of the property owner of \nsuch household (if different). \nb.  A property owner who refuses permission to replace the portion \nof the service line lying beneath his or her property shall have 3 \nmonths from the date he or she initially declines replacement to \ngrant the City permission to replace the portion of the service \nline lying beneath his or her property. To ensure that there is \nsufficient time to replace the service lines of property owners \nand residents whose permission is sought in the last year of the \n3-year period set forth in Paragraph 20, the City shall contact \nthe property owners and residents at all replacement eligible \nhouseholds to seek permission to conduct excavation and \nreplacement within 18 months of the Effective Date or prior to \nthe Year 3 Cutoff Date, whichever is later.   \n16.  New water account at replacement eligible households. The City shall \n16 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 21 of 92    Pg ID 7369\nmaintain records of the addresses of all replacement eligible households at which \nthe property owner refuses permission to replace a service line (“Refusal List”). \nWhen a resident activates a new water account at any time within 18 months of the \nEffective Date or prior to the Year 3 Cutoff Date, whichever is later, the City shall \ndetermine whether the address is on the Refusal List. If the address is on the \nRefusal List, the City shall undertake reasonable efforts to obtain permission from \nthe account holder to replace the service line. Reasonable efforts shall include \nsending at least two written requests. If permission is granted, the City shall \nreplace the service line at no cost to the new property owner within the timeline \ndescribed in Paragraph 20. If a new water account is activated more than 18 \nmonths after the Effective Date or after the Year 3 Cutoff Date, whichever is later, \nthe City must send a written notice to the new account holder that the household’s \nservice line material was not verified during City-wide service line excavation and \nreplacement in 2017 through 2020, and that the service line may contain lead or \ngalvanized steel. \n17.  Prohibition on Partial Service Line Replacements. Because partial \nlead service line replacement is frequently associated with short-term elevated lead \nlevels in drinking water, if the City discovers that the entire length of a service line \n(from the main line to the curb box to the household water meter) is composed of \nlead or galvanized steel or a combination thereof, but the property owner refuses to \n17 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 22 of 92    Pg ID 7370\ngrant the City permission to replace the portion of the service line lying beneath \nprivate property, the City shall not replace any portion of the service line. The City \nshall maintain a list of such households where a lead or galvanized steel service \nline is discovered but not replaced, and shall record the known existence of a lead \nor galvanized steel service line in the City records for each such household.   \n18.  Ability to opt in. The Parties agree that there may be some households \nin the City that are currently unoccupied and do not have an active water account, \nbut at which the property owner may want to have the service line replaced. To \nfacilitate replacement of service lines at these households, the City shall make \navailable on its website a form permitting property owners to opt in to the service \nline replacement program under this Section (Section IV.A). Property owners may \nopt in to the replacement program under this Paragraph at any time within 18 \nmonths of the Effective Date or prior to the Year 3 Cutoff Date, whichever is later. \nThe City shall maintain a list of all property owners who have completed the form, \nand shall undertake reasonable efforts to contact those property owners to seek \npermission to replace the service lines at those households. The City may require \nproperty owners that seek to opt in under this Paragraph to create an active water \naccount.    \nB.   Timeline and Milestones \n19.  The City shall complete the obligations in Paragraphs 8-18 within 3 \n18 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 23 of 92    Pg ID 7371\nyears of the Effective Date.  \n20.

In making this \ndetermination, the City shall consider all relevant information available to them, \nincluding without limitation information obtained through completion of service \nline replacement under Proposal No. 17-560; any additional excavations (through \nhydro vacuum or other methods) completed after the Effective Date; and any \nadditional investigation of service line material at households conducted in \nconnection with tap water monitoring under this Agreement.  \n25 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 30 of 92    Pg ID 7378\n30.  Within 30 days after the completion of excavations and service line \nreplacements at replacement eligible households identified in Zones 1 through 10 \nin Proposal Nos. 17-560, 2017 Replacement of Water Service Lines (Zones 1-10), \nand 17-564, 2017 Replacement of Water Service Lines (Zones 1-9), the City shall \nprovide a written statement to all other Parties summarizing the data and \ninformation used in the evaluation outlined in Paragraph 29, and the City’s relevant \nconclusions regarding (i)-(iii) in Paragraph 29. Within 14 days of receiving the \nwritten statement under this Paragraph, any other Party shall notify the City of \nwhether they concur with the findings in the written statement. To the extent any \nParty does not concur with the findings in the City’s statement, any Party may \ninitiate the dispute resolution process described in Section XIII. No monies will be \nreleased pursuant to Paragraph 31 until the resolution of any dispute arising under \nthis Paragraph.  \n31.  Release of Reserve Monies. If the Allocated Monies will be sufficient \nto complete the excavations and service line replacements of all lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines in the City, based on the evaluation conducted under \nParagraph 29, then the Reserve Monies must no longer be retained as required \nunder Paragraph 27 and will be distributed to the City for the purposes identified in \nsection 2201(b) of, and in accordance with, the WIIN Act.  \n32.  Obligation to seek additional funds. If, based on the evaluation \n26 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 31 of 92    Pg ID 7379\nconducted pursuant to Paragraph 29, it is reasonably likely that the Allocated \nMonies and Reserve Monies will be insufficient to complete the 18,000 \nexcavations and replacements identified in Paragraphs 8-18 plus any additional \nexcavations and replacements identified, State Parties shall undertake all \nreasonable efforts to secure additional monies (including, if necessary, seeking \nappropriations from the Michigan State Legislature) sufficient to reimburse the \nCity for costs related to the excavations and replacements described in Paragraphs \n8-20 at replacement eligible households. Any additional monies secured by State \nParties under this Paragraph shall be made available for reimbursement or payment \nunder Paragraph 23. State Parties shall undertake the reasonable efforts required \nunder this Paragraph and shall provide Plaintiffs with a written report documenting \nsuch efforts and the results within 90 days of Plaintiffs’ concurrence or the \nresolution of any disputes under Paragraph 30.  \n33.  Obligation to replace additional service lines. If, based on the \nevaluation conducted pursuant to Paragraph 29, it is reasonably likely that there \nwere more than 18,000 lead and galvanized steel service lines at replacement \neligible households in the City as of the Effective Date, then the milestones in \nParagraph 20 shall be modified and the City shall complete excavation and \nreplacement of the updated total number of estimated lead and galvanized steel \nservice lines in the City within 3 years of the Effective Date. If additional monies \n27 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 32 of 92    Pg ID 7380\nare necessary to conduct excavations and service line replacements under this \nParagraph, the City will conduct those excavations and service line replacements \nonly if State Parties secure additional monies for reimbursement or payment under \nParagraph 23, as described in Paragraph 32. In the event that additional monies \nState Parties secure as described in Paragraph 32 are insufficient to complete the \nCity’s obligations under this Paragraph, the City shall nonetheless complete as \nmany replacements of lead and galvanized steel service lines at replacement \neligible households as the additional monies allow.    \nD.   Process \n34.  Flushing protocol. The City shall ensure that, after replacement of a \nservice line at a household, flushing is conducted for at least 15 minutes at the hose \nbib outside the house, and that the resident is instructed to flush the taps inside the \nhouse for at least 15 minutes by opening the taps as wide as possible and flushing \nthe water at the highest velocity possible after removing and cleaning any aerators \nand Faucet Filters. \n35.  Notice of lead or galvanized steel premise plumbing. If the City \ndiscovers that a household has premise plumbing made of lead or galvanized steel, \nthe City shall provide notice to the property owner and residents of the household \nof the premise plumbing material, and that the premise plumbing in the household \nmay be a source of lead in drinking water.  \n28 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 33 of 92    Pg ID 7381\n36.  Contract management and recordkeeping. The City shall maintain \nrecords sufficient to comply with the reporting and disclosure requirements under \nthis Agreement.  \n37.  Oversight. Plaintiffs or State Parties may request in writing to meet \nand confer with the City about whether the actions planned or taken under this \nSection will ensure compliance with the timeline and milestones in Paragraphs 19-\n20.

Faucet Filter Maintenance after Service Line Replacement   \n38.  Government Parties shall ensure that at each household where a \nservice line is replaced, residents are instructed to use filtered water for at least 6 \nmonths following the service line replacement. Unless the resident refuses, \nGovernment Parties will make a good faith effort to ensure that each household has \na properly installed Faucet Filter immediately after its service line replacement is \ncomplete and a sufficient number of replacement cartridges for 6 months of use. A \ngood faith effort shall include three attempts to obtain access to a household to \nproperly install a Faucet Filter. For the excavations and replacements undertaken \nby the City with respect to the first 6,000 service lines under Paragraph 20.a, State \nParties will fulfill the obligations under this Paragraph. Thereafter, the City shall \n29 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 34 of 92    Pg ID 7382\nfulfill the obligations under this Paragraph. Government Parties will document any \nrefusal by a resident for a filter installation under this Paragraph and provide that \ndocumentation to Plaintiffs upon request, within 14 days of such request.  \n39.  Replacement cartridges. State Parties will provide the City with filter \nreplacement cartridges for the City to make available to residents free of charge at \nCity Hall, or another location designated by the City, until one year after the \nCompletion of Service Line Replacement. The replacement cartridges shall be \ncompatible with the Faucet Filters distributed and installed through the Community \nOutreach and Resident Education (CORE) Program in Section VI.  \nF.   Monitoring in Connection with Service Line Replacements \n40.  Confirming Lead Elimination After Replacement (CLEAR) Program. \nState Parties shall recruit at least 200 households to participate in tap water \nmonitoring as part of the CLEAR program. State Parties shall make reasonable \nefforts to include a geographically diverse set of eligible households in the CLEAR \nprogram. At each household participating in the CLEAR program tap water \nmonitoring, State Parties shall direct the resident to, using procedures that comply \nwith the Lead and Copper Rule, 40 C.F.R. § 141.86, and at no cost to the resident: \na.  collect a tap water sample within 90 days prior to replacement \nof the lead or galvanized steel service line serving that \nhousehold (round 1); and \n30 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 35 of 92    Pg ID 7383\nb.  collect a tap water sample monthly for 6 months following \nreplacement of the lead or galvanized steel service line serving \nthe household (rounds 2 through 7).   \n41.  State Parties shall make reasonable efforts to pick up resident-\ncollected samples as part of the CLEAR program, including at least 3 attempted \npick-ups for each sample collected.  \n42.  If, during a round described in Paragraphs 40.a and 40.b, the total \nnumber of households recruited for the CLEAR program that successfully collect \nsamples for that round falls below 100, State Parties will continue to recruit \nadditional households to participate in the CLEAR program until a minimum of \n100 participating households have collected samples for each round described in \nParagraphs 40.a and 40.b.  \n43.  If the household otherwise qualifies as a Tier 1 sampling site pursuant \nto 40 C.F.R. § 141.86(a)(3), Government Parties may use the tap water samples \ncollected under Paragraph 40 to count towards the minimum required number of \ntap water samples to be collected during a 6-month monitoring period under \nParagraph 46. \n44.  State Parties shall make the results of tap water testing conducted as \npart of the CLEAR Program publicly available by posting the results on a website \ncontrolled by some or all State Parties. State Parties shall update the results posted \n31 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 36 of 92    Pg ID 7384\nonline within 7 days of receiving each round of complete data from the laboratory. \nAny monitoring results posted online pursuant to this Paragraph shall remain \npublicly available and posted online until the Termination Date.   \nG.  Completion of Service Line Replacement \n45.  If the City determines that it has materially complied with all of its \nobligations under Paragraphs 8-20, 28-30, 33, and 38 of this Agreement, it shall \nprovide a written statement to all Parties stating the specific date upon which the \nCity believes it completed such obligations and explaining the basis for its \nconclusion. Within 14 days of receiving the written statement under this Paragraph, \nall Parties shall notify the City whether they concur with the conclusions in the \nwritten statement. If all Parties concur with the City’s conclusion in the written \nstatement, the City’s obligations under Paragraphs 8-20, 28-30, 33, and 38 of this \nAgreement shall be deemed to be completed as of the date indicated in the City’s \nstatement. This date will constitute the “Completion of Service Line \nReplacement.” To the extent any Party does not concur with the conclusions in the \nCity’s statement, any Party may initiate the dispute resolution process described in \nSection XIII. \nV.  Tap Water Monitoring  \n \nA.   Tap Water Monitoring During Consecutive 6-month Periods   \n \n46.  Government Parties shall monitor the tap water distributed through \n32 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 37 of 92    Pg ID 7385\nFlint’s Water System for lead in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule, 40 \nC.F.R. § 141.86, during consecutive 6-month periods, including the period \nbeginning January 1, 2017, and continuing thereafter.  \n47.  Government Parties shall not seek, and the Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality shall not permit, reduced monitoring for the Flint Water \nSystem under 40 C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4) until one year after Completion of Service \nLine Replacement.  \n48.  Tap water monitoring conducted under Paragraph 46 shall include, for \neach 6-month monitoring period, the collection of tap water samples from at least \nthe minimum number of sites specified in the first column (“standard monitoring”) \nof the table in 40 C.F.R. § 141.86(c). All sites at which tap water monitoring is \nconducted under Paragraph 46 shall be Tier 1 sampling sites, as defined in 40 \nC.F.R. § 141.86(a)(3).  \n49.  For tap water monitoring conducted under Paragraph 46, during each \n6-month monitoring period, at least half of the minimum number of required \nsamples specified in Paragraph 48 shall be collected during May-June or July-\nAugust.    \nB.   Independent Monitoring Program \n50.  An independent program shall be established to conduct additional tap \nwater monitoring for the Flint Water System.  \n33 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 38 of 92    Pg ID 7386\n51.  The Parties shall meet and confer to agree on a third-party \nIndependent Monitor to conduct tap water monitoring pursuant to this Section \n(Section V.B). The Independent Monitor shall be a person with expertise in \ncollecting and processing tap water samples for lead, and must not have been \nemployed by or provided consulting services to any Party relating to drinking \nwater in Flint, Michigan during the 5 years prior to the Effective Date. If a Party \nsuggests a potential Independent Monitor who has served as a consultant or expert \nfor that Party during the last 5 years concerning a matter other than drinking water \nin Flint, Michigan, then that Party shall disclose that fact and the nature of the prior \nconsulting or expert work to the other Parties at the time the name is suggested. If, \nafter 30 days from the Effective Date, the Parties cannot agree on an Independent \nMonitor, Plaintiffs and Government Parties shall each submit one nomination to \nthe Court (one nomination for Plaintiffs, collectively, and one nomination for \nGovernment Parties, collectively) within 35 days from the Effective Date. The \nParties shall jointly request that the Court select the Independent Monitor to \nconduct the monitoring described in this Section (Section V.B) within 45 days \nfrom the Effective Date.  \n52.  The Independent Monitor shall conduct household tap water \nmonitoring for lead in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule at a minimum of \n100 Tier 1 sampling sites during consecutive 6-month monitoring periods, for 3 \n34 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 39 of 92    Pg ID 7387\nyears following the Effective Date. These 100 sampling sites shall be distinct from \nthe sites used for tap water monitoring conducted under Paragraph 46. The first 6-\nmonth monitoring period will begin on July 1, 2017, or on another date agreed \nupon by the Independent Monitor and Plaintiffs. The Independent Monitor may \nconduct monitoring at fewer than 100 Tier 1 sampling sites only if Plaintiffs \napprove.  \n53.  The Independent Monitor shall identify the sampling sites used for \nmonitoring under this Section (Section V.B). Plaintiffs may assist the Independent \nMonitor with identifying the sampling sites. At the Independent Monitor’s or \nPlaintiffs’ request, Government Parties will provide any records and other \ninformation in their custody or control to facilitate confirmation that the sites \nidentified by the Independent Monitor (i) are Tier 1 sampling sites, and (ii) are not \nbeing used as sites for tap water monitoring under Paragraph 46 for a particular 6-\nmonth monitoring period.   \n54.  Plaintiffs shall execute a contract with the Independent Monitor to \nconduct the tap water monitoring described in Paragraphs 50-53 and 55-56. State \nParties shall timely reimburse Plaintiffs for reasonable costs incurred under that \ncontract, excluding any overhead or oversight costs incurred by Plaintiffs and up to \na maximum of $25,000 per 6-month monitoring period. \n55.  If the 90th percentile lead level of the samples collected as part of the \n35 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 40 of 92    Pg ID 7388\nIndependent Monitoring Program under this Section is below the Lead Action \nLevel for two consecutive 6-month monitoring periods, State Parties shall \ndiscontinue funding for the Independent Monitoring Program.  \n56.  The Independent Monitor shall provide the results from the tap water \nmonitoring conducted under Paragraph 52 to the Parties within 14 days after the \nend of the 6-month monitoring period. Within 30 days after the end of the 6-month \nmonitoring period, State Parties shall make those results publicly available through \na website controlled by some or all of State Parties. Any monitoring results posted \nonline pursuant to this Paragraph shall remain publicly available and posted online \nuntil the Termination Date.   \nC.   Sample Collection \n57.  All household tap water samples collected for the purposes of \nimplementing this Agreement shall be collected using wide-mouth sample bottles \nas described in Paragraph 2.dd.  \n58.  All household tap water samples collected for the purpose of \nimplementing this Agreement shall be collected without the practice of pre-\nstagnation flushing, as described in a Memorandum from Peter C. Grevatt, \nDirector, Office of Ground Water & Drinking Water, U.S. EPA, to Water Division \nDirectors, Regions I – X, U.S. EPA, dated February 29, 2016, regarding \nClarification of Recommended Tap Sampling Procedures for Purposes of the Lead \n36 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 41 of 92    Pg ID 7389\nand Copper Rule, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit F. No tap water sampling \ninstructions provided to residents for the purposes of collecting tap water samples \nunder this Agreement shall include an instruction to conduct pre-stagnation \nflushing prior to collecting the sample. \nD.   Voluntary Residential Monitoring  \n59.  Until one year after the Completion of Service Line Replacement, \nGovernment Parties shall continue to provide household tap water testing kits to \nresidents who want to test their tap water for lead. Government Parties shall \nprovide these testing kits and the testing free of charge to residents. Government \nParties shall make household tap water testing kits available for residents to pick \nup at City Hall, and may make tap water testing kits available at other locations. \nState Parties will cover the costs of the tap water testing kits.   \n60.  Government Parties may charge a reasonable fee to cover costs of \ntesting a resident’s tap water for lead if the resident has already submitted more \nthan two testing kits for the purpose of testing his or her tap water during the \npreceding 6 months. \n61.  State Parties shall ensure that each household that submits a tap water \ntesting kit pursuant to Paragraph 59 is notified of the tap water monitoring results \nfor that individual household no later than 30 days after the Flint Water System \nlearns of those results. This notification shall be provided by mail and otherwise \n37 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 42 of 92    Pg ID 7390\ncomply with the requirements in 40 C.F.R. § 141.85(d).   \n62.  State Parties shall make the results of tap water monitoring conducted \nunder this Section publicly available on a website controlled by some or all of \nState Parties. The results posted on such a website shall be updated at least every \n30 days. Any monitoring results posted online pursuant to this Paragraph shall \nremain publicly available and posted online until the Termination Date. \nE.   Notification of Tap Water Monitoring Results \n63.  Government Parties shall implement an information check and log \nsystem at all locations where residents can drop off household tap water testing \nkits, to help ensure residents promptly receive their testing results. \n64.  A staff person at each such location shall make best efforts to verify \nthat a name and address are present and legible on each testing kit at the time of \nsubmission.  \n65.  Staff at each such location shall also maintain a log that identifies \neach testing kit that is dropped off by any identifying number on the sample bottle \nand provide written receipts to the resident upon drop-off that contain any \nidentifying number. POD or City staff receiving the testing kit shall record in the \nlog the date and time that the testing kit was received and that the staff person has \ncompleted the information check described in Paragraph 64. \n38 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 43 of 92    Pg ID 7391\nVI.  Filter Installation, Maintenance, and Education  \n \n66.  State Parties shall maintain and expand the CORE program on filter \neducation, installation, and maintenance as described in this Section. \n67.  For purposes of this Section only (Section VI), a “CORE eligible \nhousehold” is any household that has an active water account, but does not include \nhouseholds that are abandoned, as defined in Paragraph 12. \nA.  CORE Staff  \n68.  State Parties shall ensure that CORE teams are dispersed throughout \nFlint for 8 hours per day, Monday through Saturday. By March 1, 2017, State \nParties will make best efforts to disperse at least 90 education specialists daily for \n8 hours per day on Mondays through Saturdays. CORE education specialists will \nbe dispersed on Sundays for up to 8 hours to conduct scheduled appointments with \nCORE eligible households and Initial and Follow-up Visits. The number of CORE \neducation specialists dispersed on Sundays may vary depending on demand and \nstaff availability.   \n69.  Starting March 1, 2017, State Parties will make a good-faith effort to \nmaintain 160 education specialists, including 16 coordinators, as part of the CORE \nstaff. In the event that the number of CORE education specialists available to \nconduct Initial and Follow-Up Visits drops to or below 150, State Parties will, \nwithin 7 days, request that GST Michigan Works! hire the number of education \n39 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 44 of 92    Pg ID 7392\nspecialists necessary to reach 165 total education specialists. State Parties will \nmake best efforts to ensure that, within 45 days of such a request to GST Michigan \nWorks!, such additional education specialists are hired and trained to conduct \nInitial and Follow-Up Visits. \n70.  Before any permanent decrease in CORE staff, State Parties shall \nprovide written notice to Plaintiffs at least 30 days before the planned staff \ndecrease and shall meet and confer with Plaintiffs concerning such a decrease upon \nrequest, within 14 days of such a request. Plaintiffs may not initiate the dispute \nresolution process described in Section XIII to address disputes arising under this \nParagraph. \n71.  Within 14 days of the Effective Date, State Parties will make available \nto Plaintiffs for review and comment any materials used to train CORE staff. All \ntraining materials used for CORE staff and written materials distributed during \nCORE visits shall be consistent with the Filter Education described in Paragraph \n77.c. State Parties shall inform Plaintiffs by written notice every 30 days, \nbeginning 30 days after the Effective Date, of any changes to these materials. \nB.  Initial Visits \n72.   Except as provided in Paragraph 74, by March 23, 2017, CORE \nteams shall make all reasonable efforts to complete an Initial Visit with every \nCORE eligible household. An Initial Visit for a CORE eligible household is \n40 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 45 of 92    Pg ID 7393\ndeemed completed if one of the following is true: \na.  There is a successful filter inspection: A CORE team has made \na successful filter inspection if the CORE team makes personal \ncontact with a resident of the household and conducts the Filter \nInspection and Education set forth in Paragraph 77; or \nb.  A resident refuses inspection: A resident refuses inspection \nwhen the CORE team makes personal contact with a resident of \nthe household, and upon an attempt by the CORE team to \nconduct the Filter Inspection and Education set forth in \nParagraph 77, the resident refuses CORE staff entry into the \nhousehold. In such circumstances, the CORE team shall attempt \nto leave with the resident a door hanger as described in \nParagraph 75 and any written educational information as \ndescribed in Paragraph 77.c.iv, and shall document whether a \nFollow-up Visit is appropriate. A Follow-Up Visit is \nappropriate unless the CORE team determines, based on \npersonal contact with the resident, that a Follow-up Visit to that \nhousehold would be rejected by the resident. In such \ncircumstances, the CORE team shall document the reasons for \nthat determination, and the household is no longer a CORE \n41 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 46 of 92    Pg ID 7394\neligible household. \n73.  CORE teams will have made all reasonable efforts to complete an \nInitial Visit at a CORE eligible household as required in Paragraph 72 if, after two \nattempted Initial Visits, they have been unable to make personal contact with a \nresident of the household.  \n74.  No Initial Visit is required for any CORE eligible household for \nwhich a CORE team conducted a Filter Inspection and Education set forth in \nParagraph 77, or its substantial equivalent, prior to the Effective Date. \n75.  CORE teams shall leave a door hanger at a CORE eligible household \nwhere they are unable to make personal contact during any attempted Initial Visit \nor Follow-Up Visit. The door hangers shall include information on the purpose of \nthe CORE program; how to schedule an appointment for a visit from a CORE \nteam; and how to get information about water-related services. A copy of the door \nhanger is attached as Exhibit G. By April 15, 2017, the door hanger shall include \nSpanish language information on the purpose of the CORE program and how to \nschedule an appointment for a visit from the CORE team.   \n76.  CORE teams dispersed on Saturdays will be instructed to attempt to \nvisit CORE eligible households where attempted Initial Visits on weekdays had \nresulted in no personal contact with a resident. \n77.  The “Filter Inspection and Education” conducted by CORE teams \n42 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 47 of 92    Pg ID 7395\nduring an Initial Visit must, at a minimum, include the following elements: \na.  Engagement \ni.  The CORE team will explain to a resident of the household \nthat they are visiting to inspect the household’s Faucet Filter \nto ensure it is properly installed and working and to provide \ninformation and training related to Faucet Filters. \nb.  Inspection \ni.  The CORE team will inspect the household’s kitchen faucet \nto determine whether a Faucet Filter has been installed.  \nii.  If a Faucet Filter has been installed on a kitchen faucet, the \nCORE team will determine whether that filter is properly \ninstalled and is operating properly. If the CORE team \ndetermines that the Faucet Filter is properly installed and is \noperating properly, the Inspection is complete. \niii.  If no Faucet Filter has been installed on a kitchen faucet, or \nif the CORE team discovers that a Faucet Filter is installed \nimproperly or is not operating properly, the CORE team will \nattempt to provide and install, at no cost to the household, a \nnew Faucet Filter and/or appropriate filter cartridge on a \nkitchen faucet. If the CORE team installs a Faucet Filter \n43 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 48 of 92    Pg ID 7396\nand/or filter cartridge, and determines that the Faucet Filter \nis properly installed and operating properly, the Inspection is \ncomplete.   \niv.

The notice will \nalso describe, to the extent known, the anticipated length of time the delay is \nexpected to persist, the cause or causes of the delay, the measures taken or to be \ntaken by the Claiming Party to prevent or minimize delay, the schedule by which \nthose measures will be implemented, and the anticipated date of compliance.  \n135.  Each Notified Party will provide written notice to all Parties of its \nposition regarding the Claiming Party’s assertion of force majeure or impossibility \nwithin 14 days of receipt of written notice under Paragraph 134.  \n136.  If the Notified Parties agree that any delay or impediment to \nperformance has been or will be caused by force majeure, the Parties will agree in \nwriting to a reasonable modification of all requirements affected by the force \nmajeure or impossibility. \n137.  If any Notified Party disagrees with any notice served by a Claiming \nParty under Paragraph 134 or the explanation of force majeure or impossibility \ntherein, or if the Parties cannot agree on new terms for compliance, any Party may \ninvoke the dispute resolution procedures described in Section XIII. \nXV.  Modification  \n138.  The Parties may, subject to Court approval, modify the terms of this \nAgreement by written agreement. The Parties shall file a joint stipulation and \nnotice to the Court for any such modification. Upon the reasonable request of any \n74 \n \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   Doc # 147-1   Filed 03/27/17   Pg 79 of 92    Pg ID 7427\nParty, the Parties will jointly request expedited consideration of such joint \nstipulation and notice from the Court.

The Parties agree that the Court has jurisdiction over this Case \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8 and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The Parties will submit a \nstipulation of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n41(a)(2), in the form attached as Exhibit J. The Parties’ stipulation is contingent on \nthe Court’s entry of an order first incorporating the terms of this Agreement and \nretaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement until the Termination \nDate. If the Court declines to incorporate the terms of this Agreement or retain \nsuch jurisdiction, this Agreement is not effective and any stipulation of dismissal is \nnull and void. \n140.  All Parties to this Agreement consent to enforcement of this \nAgreement in the Court and under the terms set forth in the Agreement. All Parties \nwaive any jurisdictional challenges to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction to \nenforce the Agreement. Notwithstanding this paragraph, State Parties only waive \nany applicable Eleventh Amendment immunity to the extent necessary to enforce \nthis Agreement. \n141.

No appeal shall be taken from the Court’s incorporation of this \nAgreement into an order dismissing this Case with prejudice pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2). This provision does not preclude any Party from \nappealing a subsequent order of the Court. \n143.  Within 3 business days of the Effective Date, State Defendants will \nfile a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b) to dismiss \ntheir appeal currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, Case No. 16-2628.

That ruling was\nbased on testimony furnished by the State defendants that unfiltered tap water delivered to Flint\nusers does not comply with the Lead and Copper Rule and is unsafe to drink.  The primary method\nof water delivery outlined in this Court’s order was through the Flint Water System’s existing\ntransmission infrastructure with the added protection of properly installed and maintained water\nfilters.  The State’s witnesses assured the Court that tap water run through a properly installed and\nmaintained water filter is safe to drink.  For those households that do not have a properly installed\nand maintained water filter, the Court ordered the defendants to deliver bottled water.\nThe Michigan Attorney General has filed a motion on behalf of the State defendants asking\nthat this Court’s order for safe drinking water be stayed.  He says that the current method of\n\n“delivery,” whereby Flint residents must find a way to retrieve their own drinking water, and can\nuse water filters that may or may not be installed and maintained correctly, is good enough.  He\nbases his arguments on the premise that all of the factors relevant to a stay pending appeal favor the\nCourt staying the preliminary injunction.  He is incorrect.  The State defendants’ arguments consist\nof  a  rehash  of  contentions  advanced  and  rejected  by  the  Court  earlier  in  this  case,  a\nmischaracterization of the nature of the relief ordered, and factual assertions that are unfaithful to\nthe record.  The motion to stay the preliminary injunction will be denied.  \nI.\nBased on the evidence presented by the parties — including the State defendants’ witnesses\n— the Court was convinced that the most effective means to ensure compliance with the Safe\nDrinking Water Act’s (SDWA) Lead and Copper Rule for the benefit of Flint residents was the\nproper installation and maintenance of faucet water filters for all water system users.  That\nconclusion was supported by the testimony of two of the State defendants’ witnesses: MDEQ Chief\nBryce Feighner and Michigan State Police Captain Christopher Kelenske.  For those households for\nwhich the defendants could not demonstrate compliance, the Court ordered that bottled water be\ndelivered.  \nIn their stay motion, the State defendants cite the cost of monthly delivery of bottled water\nto 100% of the Flint households as the basis for their conclusion that the Court’s remedial order is\nunreasonable and overbroad.  That peculiar argument is based on a demonstrably false premise. \nMoreover, when considering the nature of the remedy ordered to address the continuing violation\nof the SWDA’s regulations, and the consequences of noncompliance, a balance of the applicable\nfactors does not favor a stay of the preliminary injunction.    \n-2-\n\nThe traditional factors balanced with each other when deciding whether to stay a court’s\norder pending appeal are: “‘(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the\nmerits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a\nstay; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants the stay; and (4) the public\ninterest in granting the stay.’”  Michigan State A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Johnson, 833 F.3d 656,\n661 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Serv. Emp. Int’l Union Local 1 v. Husted, 698 F.3d 341, 343 (6th Cir.\n2012) (quoting Mich. Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153\n(6th Cir. 1991)).  The factors are “‘interrelated considerations,’” Husted, 698 F.3d at 343 (quoting\nGriepentrog, 945 F.2d at 153), meaning that a strong showing of irreparable injury, for example,\nmight make up for a modest showing of likely success,  Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at 153-54 (observing\nthat “more of one excuses less of the other” (citations omitted)).  However, a defendant seeking to\nstay a district court’s judgment “is still required to show, at a minimum, ‘serious questions going\nto the merits.’”  Ibid. (quoting In re DeLorean, 755 F.2d 1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985).  \nA.\nThe State defendants argue that they are likely to be successful on their appeal for at least\nfour reasons.  They say, first, that the Treasurer and members of the RTAB are not “operators” of\nthe Flint water system; second, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits the remedial relief the plaintiffs\nseek because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate an ongoing violation of the Safe Drinking Water\nAct (SWDA); third, the injunction is overbroad and unsupported by reliable evidence; and fourth,\nthe Court failed to comply with the security requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c). \nThe Court will address each in turn.\n-3-\n\nThe argument that the State defendants — the state treasurer and members of the Flint\nReceivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) — are not operators of the Flint water system has\nbeen discussed and rejected in the Court’s opinion denying the motion to dismiss, Concerned\nPastors for Soc. Action v. Khouri, No. 16-10277, 2016 WL 3626819, at *11 (E.D. Mich. July 7,\n2016), and the order for the preliminary injunction, Concerned Pastors, 2016 WL 6647348, at *6-8\n(E.D. Mich. Nov. 10, 2016).  The State defendants rely on Phillips v. Snyder, 836 F.3d 707, 715-16\n(6th Cir. 2016), for the proposition that emergency managers appointed by the governor are local\nactors.  The case contains no such holding, although it does confirm that “states may allocate the\npowers of subsidiary bodies among elected and non-elected leaders and policymakers.”  Id. at 715\n(citing Sailors v. Board of Education, 387 U.S. 105 (1967)).  And it is true that the mere act by a\nstate governor of appointing a public official — even when that official displaces a locally elected\nofficial — does not make the governor responsible for everything that the appointee does.  But as\ndiscussed in detail in the previous opinions, Michigan law subjects emergency financial managers\nto oversight by the governor and the state treasurer, and curtails the power of local government\nofficials during the state receivership.  Mich. Com. Laws §§ 141.1549(2), (3)(d), (3)(e), (8); Phillips,\n836 F.3d at 712.  \nMoreover, Flint is still in state receivership and the emergency manager orders are still in\neffect and cannot be modified by the City.  One such order requires the City to take all steps\nnecessary to complete the KWA project.  The RTAB must make and approve any decisions to\nremediate the continuing crisis in Flint, and substantial evidence shows that the State defendants\nhave significant involvement with compliance going forward.  Because the State defendants\neffectively “manage[] . . . the affairs of [the Flint water] facility,” United States v. Bestfoods, 524\n-4-\n\nU.S. 51, 66 (1998), they are responsible as operators because they “exercise . . . direction over the\nfacility’s activities,” id. at 71. \nThe State defendants’ argument that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits the Court’s\ninjunction is premised on their belief that there are no ongoing violations of the SDWA.  The\nevidence establishes otherwise.  Monitoring violations are continuing and are likely to recur. \nNeither the sentinel site program nor residential monitoring that relies on volunteers who do not\nhave homes from the pre-selected high-risk pool comply with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR). \nMr. Feighner testified that the sentinel and extended sentinel sites do not all meet the LCR’s high-\nrisk criteria.  Moreover, as the plaintiffs point out, Flint’s Water Treatment Plant Supervisor JoLisa\nMcDay admitted at deposition in July 2016 that the water system did not have the proper monitoring\nprogram in place.  Nor is it likely that the monitoring will be complied with in the near future\nbecause there are not an adequate number of qualified personnel to ensure compliance.  Although\nMr. Feighner testified about the current monitoring efforts, he did not rebut evidence of inadequate\nstaffing and long-standing violations of the LCR monitoring requirements.  \nThe State defendants make the point that the Court erred by stating that the 15 ppb “action\nlevel” for lead content was a “maximum contaminant level” (MCL).  They are correct that this\nstatement was erroneous.  The EPA’s MCL goal for lead is zero.  The EPA decided not to establish\nan MCL for lead, and instead adopted a treatment technique approach, which set an “action level”\nof 15 ppb that triggered a number of compliance measures such as corrosion control, source water\ntreatment, lead service line replacement, and public education.  Maximum Contaminant Level Goals\nand National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper, 56 FR 26460-01 at 26477. \nNonetheless, the plaintiffs are correct that the Court did not rely on the misstatement of an MCL to\n-5-\n\nconclude that the Flint water system did not have optimal corrosion control treatment.  The Court\nsummarized the relevant regulations and credited information that showed lead levels in the water\nboth above and below 15 ppb.  The Court finally concluded that it is not in dispute that the action\nlevel was exceeded, and Mr. Feighner conceded that unfiltered tap water in Flint is not safe to drink\nat this time.  The SDWA violations continue, and the injunction is designed as a remedial measure\nto order compliance going forward.  \nThe State defendants’ argument that the injunction is overbroad and lacks evidentiary\nsupport is based on the mistaken notion that the primary remedial action contemplated is the door-to-\ndoor delivery of bottled water to all residents in Flint.  The main thrust of the ordered relief is the\nproper installation and maintenance of tap water filters.  For those homes that have properly installed\nand maintained water filters in place — which is the vast majority of residences, if the State\ndefendants’ witnesses are to be believed — bottled water delivery is not necessary and was not\nordered.  But there are two problems with the State defendants’ position.  First, handing out a water\nfilter does not ensure that it is effective in reducing lead content of drinking water to an acceptable\nlevel.  There must be a protocol in place to see that the filters are installed and maintained properly. \nOtherwise, the presence of a filter alone may cause the more insidious problem of false security in\nthe suitability of the tap water for drinking.  Second, for many without a proper filter in place, the\ndifficulty of obtaining drinking water is significant, as the testimony demonstrated.  The evidence\nof a systemwide problem supports the need for systemic relief for Flint residents.  The SDWA\nempowers citizens to act as “private attorneys general” to “seek relief . . . on behalf of society as a\nwhole,” further suggesting the propriety of a systemwide remedy.  See Ellis v. Gallatin Steel Co.,\n390 F.3d 461, 477 (6th Cir. 2004) (discussing Clean Air Act citizen suits); 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)(1). \n-6-\n\nThe injunction is tailored to the specific systemic harms found and is appropriate in scope.  A stay\npending appeal would perpetuate the very irreparable harm the preliminary injunction is designed\nto address.   \nFinally, the defendants are correct that the Court did not address whether a security bond was\nrequired under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).  “[T]he rule in [the Sixth] [C]ircuit has long\nbeen that the district court possesses discretion over whether to require the posting of security.”  \nAppalachian Reg’l Healthcare, Inc. v. Coventry Health & Life Ins. Co., 714 F.3d 424, 431 (6th Cir.\n2013) (quoting Moltan Co. v. Eagle–Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171, 1176 (6th Cir. 1995) (citing\nRoth v. Bank of the Commonwealth, 583 F.2d 527, 539 (6th Cir. 1978)) (emphasis in original).  “A\ncourt errs when it “‘fail[s] to . . . expressly consider[ ] the question of requiring a bond’ when the\nissue has been raised.”  Ibid. (quoting Roth, 583 F.2d at 539) (emphasis added).  The defendants\nnever broached the issue, and they have not asked for reconsideration on that point.  No error\noccurred, and the Court has significant discretion to waive the bond requirement in light of the\npublic interest.  See Moltan Co. v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171, 1175-76 (6th Cir. 1995). \nThe State defendant have not demonstrated that they are likely to prevail on the merits of the\nappeal on any of these points, and therefore this factor does not favor a stay of the injunction.\nB.\nIt is unlikely that the State defendants will be irreparably harmed absent a stay.  The\ndefendants acknowledge an obligation to furnish safe drinking water to Flint residents — an\nobligation which has eluded them following the calamity brought about by the state-appointed\nemergency managers’ decisions when operating the Flint water system.  The Court’s injunction is\n-7-\n\ndesigned reasonably to ensure that the measures taken will be effective to satisfy the demands of the\nSDWA and its regulations in the short term.  \nNotwithstanding the response to the crisis by the State defendants, Flint residents continue\nto suffer irreparable harm from a lack of reliable access to safe drinking water.  This is more than\na mere inconvenience; hunting for water has become a dominant activity in some residents’ lives,\ncausing anxiety, stress, and financial hardship.  As noted above, those who rely on filters that may\nnot be properly installed or maintained are at risk of exposure to lead.  As noted by the record, there\nare systemic barriers to water access that the injunction is tailored to address.  Compliance with the\norder does not require bottled water delivery in perpetuity, or to every household.  The defendants\nmay discontinue delivery if they ensure that a home has a properly installed and maintained water\nfilter, or residents opt out of the delivery service.\nC.\nThe State defendants contend that the public interest favors a stay because of the financial\ncommitment necessary to comply with the Court’s injunction, among other reasons discussed below. \nThey say that if the appropriated funds for Flint relief, which include other services, are redirected\nsolely to comply with the Court’s order to deliver four cases of bottled water per week to every Flint\nresident, some of the broader relief efforts will be left without funding.  That argument is based, in\nturn, on the defendants’ continued but disingenuous assertion that the cost of door-to-door water\ndelivery carries a monthly cost of $10.5 million.  The State defendants’ forceful but aimless\nlanguage on this point is undermined by the evidence they themselves have offered to the Court,\nboth at the evidentiary hearing and in support of this stay motion.  \n-8-\n\nThe $10.5 million figure is a chimera.  According to Captain Kelenske, it is based on the idea\nthat between 30,000 and 34,000 homes rely on the Flint water system, and five cases of water would\nbe delivered to each one of them every week.  But Captain Kelenske also testified that under his\nwatch, every Flint home has been visited and his operation has verified that 96% of the homes have\nwater filters.  The remaining 1,000 to 1,500 homes that are on the water system but have not been\nverified as having a water filter may be because some of those homes are unoccupied.  Captain\nKelenske did not say that all of the households with water filters have them properly installed and\nmaintained.  But according to the State defendants’ witness, George Krisztian, the cost of verifying\nthat faucet water filters are installed and maintained properly is $955,971.  Moreover, how\ncompliance with the injunction might affect other state-funded projects in Flint is in the State\ndefendants’ hands.  Because State defendants substantially can control the costs of compliance, and\ncan fund those costs from the state treasury, the order does not necessarily require displacing any\nexisting or planned projects. \nThe defendants also insist that delivering massive amounts of bottled water to each Flint\nresident will slow the recovery of Flint’s water system by significantly decreasing the amount of\nwater moving through the Flint water system delivery lines.  There is no factual support for that\nassertion, and it defies common sense.  Even where no effective filter is in place, faucet uses that\nbottled water delivery may displace constitute only a small fraction of household water use. \nAccording to the EPA, an average family of four uses 400 gallons of water per day, or 2800 gallons\nper week.  Approximately 70% of that water usage is used indoors.  The indoor water usage is\n26.7% toilet, 21.7% clothes washing, 16.8% shower, 15.7% faucet, 13.7% leaks, and 5.3% other. \n-9-\n\nFaucet usage includes washing hands and dishes, as well as drinking water and water for cooking.\nhttps://www3.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html (last visited December 2, 2016). \nThe State defendants argue that the Court’s order is contrary to the public interest because\nwater needs to move through the water pipes in order to reform the scale that prevents lead from\nleaching into the water.  The argument goes that any water delivered to Flint residents would offset\nthe amount of water that moves through the water system therefore slowing the reformation of the\northophosphate scale.  This argument is specious, because the amount of water displaced by bottled\nwater use is negligible.  \nMoreover, Flint residents are already offsetting the amount of water moving through the\nwater system by consuming large amounts of bottled water.  And, as noted above in several places,\nthe Court’s order does not call for bottled water delivery to every house.  It calls for water filters to\nbe installed and properly maintained, which in turn would increase rather than decrease the amount\nof water moving through the water system.  Finally, even if the State decided to ignore the water\nfilters and instead deliver bottled water to every house in Flint, the amount of water offset would be\nvery small — about 1.7% of usage for a family of four.  And in any case, the defendants can address\nthis issue by installing and maintaining filters, which should result in no water use reduction.  \nThe State defendants also argue that complying with the Court’s order could add an\nadditional 4.7 million plastic bottles to Flint’s recycling system each week.  That argument assumes,\nhowever, that (1) door-to-door bottled delivery would be provided to every Flint residence — a\npremise that is simply false; and (2) delivery of bottled water would have an effect on the amount\nof bottled water usage, compared to the present system of requiring residents to fetch the cases of\nbottled water from distribution points.  There is no evidence on this second point.  If recycling empty\n-10-\n\nwater bottles is a municipal problem, it is one that already exists, because Flint residents know that\nit is not safe to drink unfiltered tap water.  The purported recycling problem was caused by the\ndamage wrought on the Flint water system infrastructure through the ill-advised decisions of\nappointed receivership officials.  The Court’s injunction would have no effect on that score, and the\nargument impacts the public interest factor not at all.  \nNext, the State defendants argue that the scope of the Court’s door-to-door delivery has no\nknown precedent.  Perhaps, but there also is no precedent for the systemic infrastructure damage to\na water delivery system caused by a public official’s decision to switch to a water source that is\ncorrosive and the failure to “install and operate optimal corrosion control treatment.”  40 C.F.R. §\n141.80(d)(1); see also 40 C.F.R. § 141.2 (“Optimal corrosion control treatment . . . means the\ncorrosion control treatment that minimizes the lead and copper concentrations at users’ taps while\ninsuring that the treatment does not cause the water system to violate any national primary drinking\nwater regulations.”);  40 C.F.R. § 141.82(g) (“All systems optimizing corrosion control shall\ncontinue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, including maintaining water\nquality parameters at or above minimum values or within ranges designated by the State.”  The relief\nordered is consistent with the EPA’s requirements in the LCR.  The order builds on the existing\nwater distribution mechanisms to provide a rough substitute for the essential service that municipal\nwater systems must furnish, and mirrors what the EPA already requires of water systems that seek\nexemptions from the LCR.  See 40 C.F.R. § 142.62(f)-(h).       \nD.\nThe Lead and Copper Rule is intended to“provide maximum human health protection by\nreducing the lead and copper levels at consumers’ taps to as close to the MCLG as is feasible.” \n-11-\n\nMaximum Contaminant Level Goals and National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead\nand Copper, 56 Fed. Reg. 26460-01 (June 7, 1991).  Because, according to the State defendants’\nwitnesses, unfiltered tap water delivered to water customers of the Flint water system is not safe to\ndrink, the public interest is not served by staying the injunction designed to ensure that each water\nuser has an operational tap water filter, or that there is a suitable alternative for the delivery of safe\ndrinking water at the point of use.  \nII.\nThe factors set out in Michigan State A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Johnson, 833 F.3d 656, 661\n(6th Cir. 2016), do not favor staying the Court’s preliminary injunction.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion to stay the injunction pending appeal [dkt.\n#97] is DENIED.   \ns/David M.

Honorable David M. Lawson\nNICK A. KHOURI, FREDERICK HEADEN, \nMICHAEL A. TOWNSEND, DAVID \nMCGHEE, MICHAEL A. FINNEY, \nBEVERLY WALKER-GRIFFEA, NATASHA \nHENDERSON, and CITY OF FLINT, \nDefendants.\n_______________________________________/\nORDER ALLOWING PRELIMINARY DISCOVERY\nThe plaintiffs filed the present action on January 27, 2016 seeking relief under the Safe\nDrinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f, et seq., from contamination of water supplied by the Flint\nWater System.  The Court held a hearing on the defendants’ motions to dismiss on May 13, 2016,\nand adjourned without date a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  After\nthe motion hearing, the Court held a status conference conducted at the request of the parties to\ndiscuss preliminary discovery related to the preliminary injunction motion.  The Court requested the\nparties to submit letters outlining their respective discovery requests, which have been received.   \nThe plaintiffs seek depositions of the following four witnesses: Captain Chris A. Kelenski,\nDeputy State Director of the Michigan State Police; Michael Glasgow, City of Flint Utilities\nAdministrator; Rodney S. Branch, Chief of Staff to City of Flint Mayor Karen Weaver; and Jody\nLundquist, Chief Financial Officer for the City of Flint.  These witnesses all submitted declarations\n\nand an affidavit in support of the various defendants’ responses to the motion for a preliminary\ninjunction.  The plaintiffs also seek the production of the documents that each witness relied on or\nreviewed in preparing his or her declaration or affidavit, and any additional documents reviewed in\npreparation for the depositions, to be produced at the time of the relevant deposition.  \nThe state defendants ask to depose any of the witnesses that the plaintiffs intend to call\nduring the preliminary injunction motion hearing, and also the two experts who submitted\ndeclarations in support of the plaintiffs’ motion: Daniel E. Giammar, Ph.D., P.E. and Bruce P.\nLanphear, M.D.  The city defendants would like to depose all of the individuals that the plaintiffs\nintend to depose prior to the motion for a preliminary injunction hearing.  However, all defendants\nrequest that no depositions be scheduled by any party until the Court rules on the pending motions\nto dismiss.\nThere is no suggestion in the record that the parties have conducted a conference to establish\na discovery plan under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f).  Normally, “[a] party may not seek\ndiscovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f),” unless\n“authorized . . . by court order.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1).  The Court has discretion to allow\ndiscovery before a case management conference and prior to a Rule 26(f) conference if it believes\nthat the discovery will advance the case toward resolution and address critical issues.  The plaintiffs\nhave identified important concerns in their motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Court\nbelieves that the discovery requested will aid in the determination of those matters.\nThe Court has not yet ruled on the motions to dismiss.  Although a decision will issue on\nthose motions in due course, the discovery related to the preliminary injunction motion should not\nbe delayed for that reason.  \n-2-\n\nThe more contentious question among the parties stems from the defendants’ insistence that\nany deposition taken be the only deposition that the deponents are required to give in this case.  The\nplaintiffs prefer that all depositions taken to prepare for the preliminary injunction motion be limited\nin scope to the issues set forth in each witness’s declaration or affidavit. And the plaintiffs ask that\nthe depositions not count towards the limit set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30 because\nthe depositions are related to the application for preliminary relief and relate solely to the feasibility\nand necessity of that relief.\nDepositions ordinarily are noticed and taken without the involvement of the Court.  However\nthe civil rules impose certain limitations, here the most pertinent of which is that “[a] party must\nobtain leave of court,” absent stipulation, to take a deposition if “the deponent has already been\ndeposed in the case[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A)(ii).  When such a request is made, the Court\n“must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(2).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A).  Rule\n26(b)(2) requires the Court to limit discovery that is “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can\nbe obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive,”\nor if a party already “had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action,”\nor if the discovery exceeds the “scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C). \nAnd the recent amendments to the civil discovery rules found in Rule 216(b)(1) emphasize that\ndiscovery must be “proportional to the needs of the case,” assessing proportionality by considering\na number of enumerated factors.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  The Court has considerable discretion\nin determining the appropriate course of discovery and tailoring the scope to the needs of each\nindividual case.  Marshall v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, No. 13-966, 2014 WL 4243775, at *1\n(S.D. Ohio Aug. 26, 2014) (quoting Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc. v. Roxane Labs., Inc., No.\n-3-\n\n2005-0889, 2007 WL 764302, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 9, 2007).  Second depositions may be allowed\nunder appropriate circumstances.  \nThe defendants have identified a justifiable concern over the potential for substantial\ninconvenience of the witnesses who might be subjected to multiple depositions over the Flint water\ncrisis.  This is not the only lawsuit filed that deals with some aspect of this very large problem. \nAccording to a motion to consolidate actions filed in Mays v. Snyder, 15-14002, pending before\nanother judge in this district, there are currently 52 related actions pending in the Eastern District\nagainst three groups of defendants: the City of Flint defendants, the State of Michigan defendants,\nand the Water Consultant defendants.  The consolidation motion notes 6 putative class actions, 45\nindividual actions on behalf of Flint residents, and the case presently before this Court.  Although\nthe plaintiffs in the present case object to consolidation of this action with the others (since this is\nthe only case that raises Safe Drinking Water Act claims, among other reasons), the witnesses face\nthe likely possibility that they could be subjected to multiple depositions.  \nHowever, it is impossible to say now whether any of these burdens will come to pass.  And\nthe Court is reluctant to give advice on whether it will allow a second deposition of the defendants’\nwitnesses, should that request be made.  If it is, the Court will assess the appropriate factors as they\nexist at that time.  For now, however, the Court will not say that second depositions will be allowed,\nand therefore the Court will not limit the scope of the depositions of the witnesses that the parties\nchoose to take at this stage of the case.  \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the parties may engage in preliminary discovery to obtain \n-4-\n\ndocuments and depose the identified witnesses prior to their Rule 26(f) conference.\ns/David M.

Did the City violate \nthis requirement by relying on guesswork and a rigged formula, and by failing to \nuse the data available to it to draw reasonable conclusions about how many lead \nand galvanized steel service lines are in Flint, and about how much it will cost to \nreplace them?  \n   \n   iv \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8071    Page 8 of 40\nCONTROLLING AUTHORITIES \nNat’l Ecological Found. v.

City of Dayton, 132 F.3d 1142 (6th Cir. 1997)   \n   v \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8072    Page 9 of 40\nINTRODUCTION \n  In the Court-ordered Settlement Agreement resolving this Safe Drinking \nWater Act case, the parties “agree[d] that replacing all lead and galvanized steel \nwater service lines in the City of Flint . . . will help reduce lead contamination in \nthe City’s drinking water.” Settlement Agmt. (Agmt.) 3, ECF No. 147-1. To that \nend, the City of Flint and City Administrator (together, the City) committed to \nlocating lead and galvanized steel service lines at thousands of homes in Flint and \nreplacing them.  \n  As a starting point, the Agreement required the City to conduct excavations2 \nat a minimum of 18,000 households over three years to locate lead and galvanized \nsteel service lines. Id. ¶ 9. However, when the Agreement was executed in March \n2017, the parties did not know with certainty how many service lines in Flint \nneeded to be replaced, or where they were. The parties thus did not know whether \n18,000 excavations would be sufficient to locate all service lines in Flint needing \nreplacement.  \nTo account for this, the City agreed to analyze the data it collected during \nthe first year of excavations and assess whether there were likely more than 18,000 \n                                                            \n2 An excavation involves digging a hole or channel at the location of a service \nline for the purpose of identifying the material of the buried service line. Agmt. \n¶ 2(l). If an excavation covered by the Agreement uncovers a lead or galvanized \nsteel service line, the City must remove the line and replace it with a copper line. \nId. ¶ 10. \n   1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8073    Page 10 of 40\nservice lines in Flint that needed to be replaced when the Agreement was executed, \nand how much it will cost to replace those lines (Paragraph 30 analysis). If the \nCity’s Paragraph 30 analysis concludes that Flint likely had more than 18,000 \nservice lines needing replacement, then the number of excavations the City must \nconduct is increased to that new number. Id. ¶ 33. The Paragraph 30 analysis is \ncritical to the Agreement’s success: it determines how many total service lines the \nCity must excavate and replace, and whether the State must seek additional \nfunding to ensure the City has enough money to finish the job.  \nThe City submitted a report concluding that there were not likely more than \n18,000 service lines needing replacement, and that the $97 million in available \nfunding under the Agreement will be sufficient to complete the required work. The \nCity, however, failed to conduct the evaluation the Agreement requires. \n  First, the City used an illogical, rigged formula that could never result in a \nconclusion that there were more than 18,000 lead and galvanized steel service lines \nin Flint. The City’s approach effectively insulates it from a finding that would \nrequire it to complete additional excavations and pipe replacements. Second, the \nCity’s estimates of the percentage of homes in Flint that will require service line \nreplacement moving forward are unsupported by the available data. Instead of \nconducting a reasoned evaluation, the City relies on guesswork and undocumented \npersonal observations of City staff to reduce the projected number of service lines \n   2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8074    Page 11 of 40\nfor replacement. The consequences of the City’s shoddy analysis are not academic. \nIf the City’s estimates are off by even two percent, it will run out of funding under \nthe Agreement.  \nAfter months of meetings and correspondence with the City to try to bring it \ninto compliance with the Agreement, Plaintiffs seek relief from the Court. The \nCity’s refusal to conduct the required evaluation undermines the central purpose of \nthe Agreement: to protect all Flint residents from lead exposure from the pipes \nbringing tap water into their homes. Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request \nthat the Court order the City to revise its estimates using sound methods applied by \nan expert qualified to conduct statistical predictive modeling. In the alternative, \nPlaintiffs request that the City use the rate of replacements observed to date to \nestimate the total number of remaining lead and galvanized service lines.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  Replacement of service lines under the Settlement Agreement  \n  \nThe centerpiece of the Settlement Agreement is a requirement that the City \nremove thousands of lead and galvanized steel service lines at occupied homes in \nFlint by January 1, 2020. See Agmt. ¶¶ 8-20. Flint had roughly 28,400 occupied \nhomes when the Agreement was executed.3 But not all the service lines connecting \n                                                            \n3 Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 19; see Woods Decl. ¶ 57 & n.15 (explaining uncertainty \nconcerning the total number of occupied homes in Flint).\n \n   3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8075    Page 12 of 40\nto those homes need to be replaced. Some are made of copper or other materials \nthat are not known to contribute to lead contamination in drinking water. \nAccordingly, the Agreement aims to provide sufficient funding to replace all \nservice lines in Flint that are composed of lead or galvanized steel.  \nThe Agreement requires the City to conduct excavations to determine the \nservice line composition at 18,000 homes (at a rate of at least 6,000 per year) and \nreplace lead and galvanized steel service lines with copper ones. Id. The State4 \nmust provide up to $97 million to reimburse the City for conducting these \nexcavations and pipe replacements. Id. ¶¶ 21-27.  \nThe 18,000 figure5 is the minimum number of excavations the City is \nrequired to conduct to identify all the lead and galvanized steel service lines at \nFlint’s roughly 28,400 occupied homes. It was arrived at through extensive \nnegotiation, like all the Agreement’s terms. See id. at 3. The 18,000 figure, \nhowever, was based on incomplete and imperfect information. E.g., Chaudhary \nDecl. Ex. 2 attach. ¶ 3 (letter from EPA explaining that Flint’s records of the \nlocations of lead service lines were inadequate and incomplete). In March 2017, \n                                                            \n4 Plaintiffs refer to State Defendants, the State of Michigan, and the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality collectively as “the State.” \n5 An April 2016 report indicated that there could be up to 20,000 lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 3 at 2 tbl.1 (total of categories \nlabeled “Lead Materials,” “Galvanized Materials,” and “Unknown”). The 20,000 \nfigure assumes that all lines that city records indicate are of unknown composition \nare in fact made of lead or galvanized steel. See id.; see also id. Ex. 12 at 2. \n \n   4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8076    Page 13 of 40\nwhen the Agreement was entered, the City did not know how many lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines were in Flint, and publicly available estimates had \nfluctuated widely over time. Compare id. Ex. 3 at 2 tbl.1 (April 2016 estimate of \n20,272 service lines), with id. Exs. 6, 7 (January 2017 estimate of 29,000 service \nlines). Similarly, no one knew where these lines were located.  \nTo account for these uncertainties, the Agreement requires the City to \nexcavate at least 6,000 service lines in 2017 and then use the data from those \nexcavations to calculate the total number of service lines that need replacement in \nFlint. See Agmt. ¶ 29. To that end, the City must “conduct an evaluation” \nfollowing the first year of excavations and pipe replacements. Id. The evaluation \nmust estimate the total number of lead and galvanized steel service lines serving \noccupied homes in Flint as of the Agreement’s execution and the cost to replace \nthem. Id.; see also id. ¶ 33 (referring to the “updated total number of estimated lead \nand galvanized steel service lines in the City”). The City must determine “whether \nthe data and information available to it support any of the following conclusions: \n(i) it is reasonably likely that there were more than 18,000 lead and galvanized \nsteel service lines at [eligible households in Flint] as of [March 28, 2017],” and/or \n(ii) the $97 million in funding available under the Agreement “can reasonably be \nexpected to cover the costs of completing the 18,000 excavations and replacements \n. . . and the total number of any additional lead and galvanized steel service lines \n   5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8077    Page 14 of 40\nanticipated in light of the evaluation of (i).” Id. ¶ 29. The City “shall consider all \nrelevant information available,” including information obtained through \nexcavations and pipe replacements completed during 2017. Id.   \nParagraph 30 of the Agreement required the City to produce a written \nstatement (Report) “summarizing the data and information used in the evaluation,” \nand describing the evaluation’s conclusions. Id. ¶ 30. The conclusions in the City’s \nReport are important: If there were likely more than 18,000 lead and galvanized \nsteel service lines in Flint as of the Agreement’s execution, then the City must \ncomplete excavations and replacements at the new total number of estimated lead \nand galvanized steel service lines in the City by March 28, 2020. Id. ¶ 33. In this \nway, the new estimate of the total number of lead and galvanized steel service lines \nin Flint will become the minimum number of excavations the City must complete.  \nCorrespondingly, if the $97 million in allocated funding is likely not \nsufficient to complete the required excavations and replacements at the estimated \ntotal number of homes with service lines needing replacement, the State must \n“undertake all reasonable efforts to secure additional monies (including, if \nnecessary, seeking appropriations from the Michigan State Legislature) sufficient \nto reimburse the City” for the required work. Id. ¶ 32. The State’s obligation to \nseek additional funding can be triggered only through the analysis conducted under \nParagraphs 29 and 30. See id. ¶¶ 29-30. \n   6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8078    Page 15 of 40\nThe evaluation under Paragraphs 29 and 30 is critical. If the City later \ndiscovers that it needs more money to complete its work, the State will not be \nrequired to seek those funds from the state legislature. Thus, this evaluation is the \nonly mechanism under the Agreement that ensures the City will have enough \nmoney to replace Flint’s lead and galvanized steel service lines.  \nII.  The City’s Paragraph 30 Report  \n \nThe City submitted its Paragraph 30 Report on February 8, 2018. Chaudhary \nDecl. Ex. 8. The Report summarized the excavation and pipe replacement work \ncompleted as of the Report’s date: through February 8, 2018, the City conducted \napproximately 8843 excavations. Id. at 2. Those 8843 excavations uncovered 6256 \nlead or galvanized steel service lines. Id. In other words, the City discovered a lead \nor galvanized steel service line at roughly 70.7% of the homes where it conducted \nexcavations. The parties refer to this percentage as the “hit rate.” \nThe Report then concluded that it is “not reasonably likely that there were \nmore than 18,000 lead or galvanized steel service lines” in Flint as of March 2017. \nId. at 1 (emphasis added). The City appears to have reached this conclusion in two \nsteps: First, it subtracted the number of lines it had excavated to date from 18,000. \nId. at 2. Second, it assumed the hit rate for the remaining 91736 lines “will continue \n                                                            \n6 The City appears to have subtracted incorrectly. The Report concludes that, \n“[w]ith 8,843 excavations completed, the City’s remaining obligations under the \nSettlement Agreement are to conduct 9,173 excavations.” Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 8 at \n   7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8079    Page 16 of 40\nto drop” to 60% in 2018 and 50% in 2019, i.e., that the City will uncover lead or \ngalvanized steel service lines at a lower percentage of homes during the 2018 and \n2019 work. Id.  \nThe Report went on to conclude that the $97 million in available funding \n“can reasonably be expected to cover the costs” of completing the remaining \nrequired work. Id. at 1. The City reached this conclusion using the number of \nremaining excavations it believes it needs to perform under the Agreement (9173). \nThe City then applied its decreasing hit rate to that figure to conclude that it will \nlikely need to replace 51697 more service lines in 2018 and 2019. See id. at 2, 4. \nBased on the City’s projections, it will need $59,221,184 to complete an \nadditional 9173 excavations and 5169 replacements. Id. at 3. The remaining \navailable funding under the Agreement is $59,750,000. Id. Thus, the City’s \nestimates leave a little over $500,000 left from the original $97 million. Assuming \na pipe replacement costs $4985 (the average of the City’s projections for 2018 and \n                                                            \n2. However, 18,000 minus 8843 equals 9157, not 9173. To avoid confusion, \nPlaintiffs use the City’s figure (9173).  \n7 Again, the City’s reported numbers appear to be based on calculation errors. \nUsing the City’s reported 9173 remaining excavations (which itself is based on a \nsubtraction error, see supra note 5), and using the City’s statements that it will \nconduct 6000 excavations in 2018 and 3173 excavations in 2019, applying the \nCity’s projected hit rates yields a total of 5187 (not 5169) remaining replacements: \n[6000 multiplied by 0.6 = 3600 replacements in 2018] + [3173 multiplied by 0.5 = \n1587 replacements in 2019] = 5187 (3600 + 1587) total remaining replacements in \n2018 and 2019, not 5169, as the City reports.  \n   8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8080    Page 17 of 40\n2019), this funding will cover at most a discrepancy of 106 replacements.8 \nIII.  The parties’ dispute concerning the validity of the Paragraph 30 \nReport’s conclusions  \n  \nOn March 1, 2018, after a meeting with the City and its engineering firm \n(AECOM), id. Ex. 9, Plaintiffs notified the City that they did not concur with its \nconclusions about the likely number of lead and galvanized steel service lines in \nFlint and the likelihood that the available $97 million in funding will cover the \ncosts of the required work. Id. Ex. 12; see Agmt. ¶ 30.9 Plaintiffs explained that the \nCity did not provide sufficient analysis or information to support its conclusion \nthat it is reasonably likely that, as of March 2017, Flint had no more than 18,000 \nlead and galvanized steel service lines. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 12 at 2. Plaintiffs also \nnoted that the City had not explained the “data and information” underlying its \nprojection that the hit rate will decrease by 10% from the observed hit rate in 2017 \n(70%) in each of the following two years. Id. (quoting Agmt. ¶ 30). Plaintiffs asked \nfor additional documentation to support the City’s conclusions. Id. at 2-3.   \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ inquiries, the City provided two additional \ndocuments: a density map created in 2016 by the University of Michigan-Flint, and \na brief “Follow-Up Summary” containing additional narrative descriptions of the \n                                                            \n8 Including the $2,000,000 buffer in the City’s budget, see Chaudhary Decl. Ex. \n8 at 4 (entries for “Construction Contingency”), the remaining funding \n($2,528,816) will cover at most 507 additional replacements. \n9 The State did not object to any of the conclusions in the Paragraph 30 Report.  \n   9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8081    Page 18 of 40\nCity’s analysis. Id. Exs. 13, 14. The Follow-Up Summary noted that the number of \nservice lines requiring replacement in 2017 (roughly 70%) was lower than the City \nexpected (80%). Id. Ex. 13. Relying on this lower-than-expected hit rate, the City \nconcluded that the original 18,000 figure likely overestimated the number of lead \nand galvanized steel service lines in Flint. See id. (paragraph (1) under heading \nlabeled, “Conclusions”).    \nThe City said that the 2016 “density map” it provided was based on postal \nservice records, city records, and possibly additional information; the City is not \ncertain exactly what data the map makers relied on. Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 17. The \nmap purports to show through color-coding whether the density of lead, \ngalvanized, and unknown service lines is likely to be high (red areas) or low (green \nareas). Id. Ex. 14. The University of Michigan-Flint team that created the map \nadmitted that there were up to 13,000 homes for which the city records had no \ninformation about the service line material, that the team had to disregard many of \nthe records that “were in pencil and unreadable,” and that the team did “not [have] \nnecessarily good information on what kind of updates were made” to the records \nover time. Id. Ex. 22; see also id. Ex. 1. The City says it started excavating in the \nred areas of the map and will move towards the green areas in 2018 and 2019.  \nPlaintiffs explained in a letter dated March 30, 2018, that the density map \nand Follow-Up Summary were not adequate to support the City’s conclusions. \n   10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8082    Page 19 of 40\nId. Ex. 15. Plaintiffs noted that the City had not provided any information about the \nassumptions underlying the map’s predictions, and had not conducted any analyses \nto test the reliability of the map—created in 2016—based on the new data collected \nfrom the 2017 pipe replacement work. Plaintiffs also explained that without any \ninformation about the basis for the City’s expected hit rate for 2017 (80%), and \nwhich variables drove the difference between that expected hit rate and the lower \nobserved hit rate (70%), the City could not reasonably draw conclusions about \nwhether that trend would continue. As a result, Plaintiffs explained that the City \ncould not reasonably conclude from this fact (that its observed hit rate in 2017 was \n10% lower than expected), that the 18,000 figure was “likely an overestimation.” \nId. at 3-4. Plaintiffs reiterated their request for any written analysis or modeling \nthat would support continued reliance on the density map. Id. at 4.  \nThe City confirmed subsequently that it had no additional “specific \ninformation or written documentation . . . describing how the City came to its \nprojections [for the decreased hit rates].” Id. Ex. 17 at 1, 2. As a result, the only \nexplanation for the City’s numbers is the assertion that \nthose projections were the result of deductive reasoning, based on the \nFAST Start Phase I-IV experiences, institutional knowledge of the \nage, and condition of the City’s infrastructure possessed by the City’s \nDepartment of Public Works, and the professional expertise and \ntraining of AECOM in assessing and planning for public works \nprojects of this type. \n \nId. Ex. 11 at 2.  \n   11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8083    Page 20 of 40\nBecause of the lack of analysis and support for the City’s projected \ndecreased hit rates, Plaintiffs proposed several statistically sound options for \nupdating the City’s service line and cost estimates. First, Plaintiffs proposed that \nthe City use the observed hit rate as of the date of the Report—70.7%10—as the \nprojected hit rate moving forward. Id. Ex. 15 at 3. Alternatively, Plaintiffs \nproposed that the City use the observed hit rate for excavations conducted through \nJuly 31, 2018, as the projected hit rate, thereby including additional information in \nthe observed rate. Id. Ex. 18 at 3. The City rejected both options. See id. Ex. 20.  \nAfter Plaintiffs notified the City that they intended to file this motion, see id. \nEx. 21, the City provided five additional files that purport to “provide additional \nsupport” for the City’s Paragraph 30 Report. Id. Ex. 23. These files include a list of \nfire hydrants in the City, including their dates of fabrication, and a map of those \nhydrants, color-coded by age. Id. The City also provided several maps showing the \ncomposition of service lines based on the City’s water service line records, which \nhave been digitized by a consultant. Id. Finally, the City provided the results of \nadditional excavations completed between April 26 and June 4, 2018. Id. Of those \nexcavations, 37.2% uncovered lead or galvanized steel service lines. The City \nasserts that these documents show that its conclusions in the Paragraph 30 Report \n                                                            \n10 70.7% is the reported observed hit rate for all excavations conducted through \nFebruary 8, 2018. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 8 at 2. 70.1% is the reported observed hit \nrate for those excavations conducted during 2017 (Phase IV) alone.

Id. Ex. 24. Plaintiffs again explained that \nthe documentation provided by the City to date does not provide adequate support \nfor the conclusions in its Report. Id.  \nFor four months, through correspondence, in-person meetings, and phone \ncalls, Plaintiffs have attempted to work with the City to resolve their objections to \nthe Paragraph 30 Report. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Settlement Agreement, which operates as a consent decree, is “a \nprospective form of relief involving continuous court oversight.” Whitlock v. FSL \nMgmt., LLC, 843 F.3d 1084, 1094 (6th Cir. 2016); Pedreira v.

Accordingly, “[t]he court’s task in \ninterpreting a consent decree is ‘to ascertain the intent of the parties at the time of \nsettlement.’” Nat’l Ecological Found. v.

Motors Corp., 67 F.3d 129, 134 (6th Cir. 1995)). \nThe meaning of the consent decree “must be discerned within its four corners,” \nUnited States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 682 (1971), and the decree “should \nbe construed to preserve the position for which the parties bargained,” Vanguards \nof Cleveland v.

Waste Mgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City \nof Dayton, 132 F.3d 1142, 1145 (6th Cir. 1997). In this way, the Court must \ninterpret the decree in light of “the circumstances surrounding its formation.” \nDotson v.

Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 \nF.3d 523, 533 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Court should reject the City’s analysis because it uses a flawed \nmethod that presumes the answer to the question it must consider \n \nThe City’s conclusion that there were not more than 18,000 lead or \ngalvanized steel service lines for replacement in Flint is invalid because the City \n   14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8086    Page 23 of 40\nused a formula that guaranteed its estimate would never exceed 18,000. In other \nwords, “no” was the only answer possible under the City’s Paragraph 30 analysis. \nThis fundamental error makes that analysis meaningless. \nThe City’s flawed method starts with an assumption that there are 18,000 \nservice lines to be excavated and subtracts the number of excavations completed as \nof February 2018 (8843), stating that the City has an obligation to complete only \n917311 more excavations. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 8 at 2. The City then applied its \nanticipated hit rates (60% in 2018 and 50% in 2019) to those remaining \nexcavations to conclude that it will likely need to replace only an additional 5169 \nlead and galvanized steel service lines. Id. at 4; see supra p. 8 & note 6.   \nThrough its analysis, the City has only calculated how many lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines are likely to be discovered if the City does 9173 more \nexcavations. But the answer to that question says nothing about whether there were \nlikely more or fewer than 18,000 total lead and galvanized steel service lines in \nFlint as of the Agreement’s execution. The City’s Report thus ignores the core \nquestion the City was required to answer: what does the new data say about how \nmany lead and galvanized steel service lines there were in Flint as of March 2017?  \nTo answer that question, the City must apply a valid projected hit rate to the \ntotal number of occupied homes that have not yet been excavated (19,557), not \n                                                            \n11 See supra note 5 (explaining the City’s subtraction error).  \n   15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8087    Page 24 of 40\njust—as the City has done—to the bare minimum number of excavations the City \nmust still complete under the Agreement (9173). Applying the hit rate to only this \nsubset of homes essentially ignores the rest of homes in Flint and artificially \nreduces the total number of homes eligible for service line replacement. It also \nmakes the City’s analysis a farce: even assuming a 99.9% hit rate, the City still \nwould conclude there were fewer than 18,000 lead and galvanized steel lines in \nFlint when the Agreement was executed.12 The City’s approach, in other words, \ncould never estimate more than 18,000 lines, and effectively renders Paragraphs 32 \nand 33 of the Agreement dead letter.   \nHad the City applied a valid projected hit rate13 to the correct number of \nremaining homes—the number of occupied homes in Flint that have not yet been \nexcavated (19,557), Woods Decl. ¶ 57 (d )—the City would have to answer “yes” \n1\nto the central question of whether there were likely more than 18,000 lead and \ngalvanized steel pipes in Flint when the Agreement was executed. See id. ¶¶ 52-57. \nIn fact, the City has already answered “yes” to this question and endorsed \nthe approach described by Plaintiffs. In a May 2018 letter to EPA calculating the \nnumber of service lines Flint still needs to replace, the City applied the observed \n                                                            \n12 9173 remaining excavations (as reported by the City) x 99.9% hit rate, \nrounded to the nearest whole number = 9164 lines remaining to be replaced. \nAdding this number (9164) to the total lead and galvanized steel lines identified \nduring 2017 (6256) = 6256 + 9164 = 15,420 total lead or galvanized steel lines.  \n13 As explained infra pp. 20-26, the City’s projected hit rates are invalid. \n \n   16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8088    Page 25 of 40\nhit rate to the total number of homes that have not yet been excavated. Chaudhary \nDecl. Ex. 19. It concluded that the City “still has approximately 14,000 lead, \ngalvanized or other [service lines] left to replace.” Id. Adding 14,000 to the total \nlead and galvanized steel pipes already identified (6256) yields more than 20,000 \npipes. Thus, mere months after the City told Plaintiffs that Flint likely had no more \nthan 18,000 service lines needing replacement, it projected to EPA that Flint likely \nhad more than 20,000 lines needing replacement as of March 2017. This \ncorrespondence underscores the incoherence of the City’s Paragraph 30 Report.   \nII.    The Court should reject the City’s analysis because the City fails to \nprovide reasonable support for its conclusion that there were no more \nthan 18,000 lead or galvanized steel service lines in March 2017 \n   \nThe City’s conclusion that “the original 18,000 ceiling was likely an \noverestimation” appears to be based on two premises: First, while the City’s \nconsultants projected that a service line would need to be replaced at “80% of the \naddresses” in areas excavated in 2017, the observed hit rate was lower, 70%. See \nid. Ex. 13 at 1. Second, this hit rate can be “expected to decline” in 2018 and 2019 \nbecause the City’s remaining excavations will be in areas “originally projected . . . \nto have much lower concentrations of service lines requiring replacement.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs have repeatedly asked the City for supporting documentation, \nwritten analysis, or statistical modeling to explain how it calculated its projected \nhit rate for 2017 (80%) and the expected decline in hit rates moving forward (60% \n   17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8089    Page 26 of 40\nfor 2018, 50% for 2019). See, e.g., Chaudhary Decl. Exs. 9 at 1 (asking the City to \n“explain the basis” for the projected declining hit rates, and asking “[w]hat data” \nthe City considered), 12 at 2-3; Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 19. \nThe City has offered scant support to explain the fundamental premises on \nwhich it bases its analysis. The City’s conclusion that Flint likely had no more than \n18,000 pipes needing replacement in March 2017 is untenable. \nA.  The difference between the projected hit rate for 2017 (80%) and \nthe observed hit rate (70.1%) does not prove that the 18,000 pipe \nceiling was an overestimate  \n \nThe City does not know how its original 80% projected hit rate was \ncalculated. It cannot identify who generated the 80% figure, the process or \nmodeling she used, or the data, records, and other specific factors she considered. \nChaudhary Decl. ¶ 17; see Woods Decl. ¶¶ 13-14. The City has told Plaintiffs that \n“we just don’t know” what the projection was based on. Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 17. \nWhen Plaintiffs raised concerns about this missing information, the City \nhypothesized that the 80% projection was based on a “review of available City \nrecords, age of local water-related infrastructure (fire hydrants/water mains), and \nother available data etc.” Id. Ex. 13. Assuming this is true, however, the City has \nnot provided any information on how these factors were applied to calculate the \n80% prediction; for example, what did the City assume about the relationship \nbetween the age of a fire hydrant on a block and the likelihood that homes on that \n   18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8090    Page 27 of 40\nsame block have lead or galvanized steel service lines? Woods Decl. ¶ 14. More \ncritically, the City offers no information on whether the factors that informed the \npredicted 80% hit rate have proven to be good predictors of the presence of lead \nand galvanized steel service lines; for example, does the presence of a fire hydrant \ninstalled before a certain year in fact reliably predict that homes on that block have \nlead or galvanized steel service lines? Id. ¶¶ 14-15.  \nWithout information on the factors that went into calculating the 80% \nprojection and whether those factors were accurate predictors of the presence of \npipes that need replacing, the City cannot draw any reasonable conclusions about \nthe significance of the difference between the predicted hit rate (80%) and the \nobserved hit rate (70.1%) for the work completed through 2017. Id. ¶ 20. It \ncertainly cannot conclude that its overestimation of the hit rate is a trend that will \ncontinue as the City expands its work to other areas of Flint. In other words, even \nif the City overestimated the proportion of lead and galvanized steel service lines \nin the areas where it conducted work in 2017, it cannot reasonably conclude that it \nalso overestimated the proportion of lines for replacement in other areas of the City \nwithout analyzing the discrepancy between the 2017 predicted and observed hit \nrates. Id. ¶¶ 20-22.  \nTo reach these conclusions in a sound way, the City should have identified \nall the factors it believes predict the presence of a lead or galvanized steel service \n   19 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8091    Page 28 of 40\nline, built a model that predicts the outcome based on those factors, and then tested \nhow well those factors performed as predictors using the data collected in 2017. \nSee id. ¶¶ 18-19. The City has not done this analysis. Id. ¶ 15. Thus, contrary to the \nCity’s assertion, the fact that the observed hit rate was lower than expected for \n2017 does not, without more, prove that the “original 18,000 ceiling was likely an \noverestimation.” Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 13 at 1; see Woods Decl. ¶ 22.   \nB.  The City provides no reasonable support for its projected \ndecrease in hit rates for 2018 and 2019 \n \nThe documents offered by the City provide no support for the second \npremise underlying its Paragraph 30 Report, that the projected hit rate will be 60% \nfor work conducted in 2018 and 50% for work conducted in 2019. The 2016 \ndensity map does not show what the City claims. And the City’s citation to general \nfactors, without explaining how those factors led to the City’s specific projections, \ndo not suffice for the “evaluation” considering all available “data and information” \nthat the Agreement requires. Agmt. ¶¶ 29-30. Plaintiffs cannot—and the Court \nshould not—accept the City’s handwaving as adequate support for its projections.  \n1.  The density map provides no support for the City’s \nprojected declining hit rates \n  \nFirst, the City’s primary reliance on a density map created in 2016 by the \nUniversity of Michigan-Flint, Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 14, is unwarranted. The City \nclaims that it is reasonable to conclude that the map’s red shaded areas will have \n   20 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8092    Page 29 of 40\nhigher hit rates than the map’s green shaded areas and so, as the City’s excavation \nwork moves away from the map’s red areas, the hit rate will necessarily decline. \nChaudhary Decl. ¶ 17. While this argument is facially appealing, it is \nfundamentally flawed.  \nThe City does not know, and the map does not indicate, what information \nthe University of Michigan-Flint used to develop the map. Id.; see id. Ex. 14; \nWoods Decl. ¶ 27. To the extent the map relies on the City’s historical records of \nservice line composition, those records were incomplete, and the map does not \nindicate whether it says anything about the more than 10,000 homes in Flint for \nwhich the City had no records in 2016. See Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 1 at 1-2; Woods \nDecl. ¶ 27. Moreover, the city records that were available when the map was \ncreated have been shown to be inaccurate to a significant degree. Chaudhary Decl. \nEx. 5 at 5 (showing that 27% (16 of 58) of homes where city records showed a full \ncopper service line in fact had at least partial lead or galvanized steel lines). \nImportantly, the map also does not appear to include information about homes that \nthe City’s records indicate have copper service lines. Woods Decl. ¶ 26. Because \nof the lack of information about the data reflected in the map, one cannot infer \nanything from the map about the relative density of lead and galvanized steel \nservice lines in different areas of Flint. See id. ¶¶ 30-32.  \nAs a result, the map cannot support the City’s projected declines in the hit \n   21 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8093    Page 30 of 40\nrate. This is because the hit rate depends on the total number of homes in a given \narea; the hit rate is equal to the total number of lead and galvanized service lines in \nan area, divided by the total number of replacement eligible households in that \narea. Thus, the total number of homes in the area—including homes with copper \nservice lines—is a key component of the hit rate. Id. ¶¶ 30-31. Because the map \ndoes not say anything about the density of homes with copper service lines, one \ncannot draw any conclusions about the hit rates of the green shaded areas \ncompared to the red shaded areas. Id. ¶¶ 31-39. For example, if a red shaded area \ncontains 10 lead or galvanized service lines and 20 total homes, then the expected \nhit rate is 50%. If that same red shaded area contains 10 lead or galvanized steel \nservice lines, but 100 total homes, then the expected hit rate is only 10%. \nMoreover, the City’s reliance on a map created in 2016, before the \nAgreement was executed, is not sufficient to meet the Agreement’s requirement to \n“consider all relevant information available,” including information obtained \nthrough excavations completed after March 2017. Agmt. ¶ 29. The entire purpose \nof the Paragraph 30 analysis was to use new data to develop a reliable estimate of \nthe total number of lead and galvanized steel service lines in Flint. \n2.  The City’s listing of general variables it considered, without \nmore, provides no support for the City’s hit rate predictions \n  \nThe variables the City repeatedly cites in support of its projected hit rates are \nhopelessly general, and the City has provided no explanation for how it applied \n   22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8094    Page 31 of 40\nthose variables to calculate its specific 60% and 50% projections. For instance, the \nFollow-Up Summary identifies a few variables the City considered as part of its \nprojections, including “age of local water-related infrastructure (fire hydrants/water \nmains), and other available data etc.” Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 13 at 1. But the general \nreference to the “age of local water-related infrastructure”—let alone “other \navailable data etc.”—does not meaningfully explain why the City expects hit rates \nof 60% and 50% in the areas slated for work in 2018 and 2019, respectively.  \nThe list of hydrants and the hydrant age map the City recently provided \n(Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 27 & Ex. 23-2) are more of the same. To be sure, it is intuitive \nto think that the age of fire hydrants on a certain block may correlate, to some \ndegree, with the presence of lead and galvanized steel service lines. But the City \nhas provided nothing to show how its hydrant map (with hydrant ages color-coded) \nand list of more than 3600 hydrants led to the specific projections that 60% and \n50% of the service lines the City excavates in 2018 and 2019, respectively, will \nneed to be replaced. See Woods Decl. ¶¶ 42-43. In this way, the City has sent \nPlaintiffs large amounts of raw data, but with no analysis of how those data fit \ntogether, or how the City used those data, to support its conclusions.14  \nTo the extent the City purports to have used these data to inform its \n                                                            \n14 The other “water card” maps recently provided by the City, Chaudhary Decl. \nExs. 23-3, 23-4, likewise contain no description about how the information in the \nmaps was used (if at all) to inform the conclusions in the Paragraph 30 Report.  \n   23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8095    Page 32 of 40\nprojections, its explanation for how it did so falls flat. The City’s general \nreferences to the “experiences” of the FAST Start program, the Department of \nPublic Works’ “institutional knowledge of the age, and condition of the City’s \ninfrastructure,” and AECOM’s “professional experience,” Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 11 \nat 2, are not a reasonable foundation for the specific 60% and 50% projections. \nThis amounts to a plea from the City to trust its say-so about where the lead and \ngalvanized service lines are in Flint. Reliance on personal, undocumented \nexperience alone is unjustified, especially when the City has provided no details on \nthe specific experience of the officials on whom it is relying, “how that experience \nleads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the \nopinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.” Cf. Fed. R. Evid. \n702 adv. comm. note. These kinds of speculative estimates are exactly what the \nAgreement sought to avoid by requiring the Paragraph 30 analysis.   \nThe City’s recent reliance on the reported 37.2% hit rate for the 954 \nexcavations conducted between April 26 and June 4, 2018, Chaudhary Decl. Ex. \n23, does not support the City’s projected hit rates, either. The City has provided no \ninformation about how those 954 homes relate to the factors the City relies on \n(e.g., how old are the hydrants near those homes?), or about whether those 954 \nhomes are representative of the full area in which excavations will be conducted in \n2018. See Woods Decl. ¶¶ 44-49. Without this information, there is no basis to \n   24 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8096    Page 33 of 40\nconclude that the low hit rate observed was not due to chance. Id. \nIn sum, although the factors the City cites seem appealing because they \ncould be plausibly related to the likely presence of lead and galvanized steel \nservice lines, the City has provided no analysis or explanation for how it applied \nthose factors to derive its specific predictions. Its predictions have thus effectively \nemerged from a black box. This Court should not give credit to conclusions that \ncannot be explained.   \n3.  Even assuming there is some support for a declining hit rate \nin 2018 and 2019, the City has not supported its specific \nnumeric projections \n   \nEven if the Court accepts the broad notion that the hit rate may decrease as \nthe City moves into the areas slated for excavations in 2018 and 2019, the City has \noffered only its ipse dixit in support of its specific prediction that the hit rate will \ndecrease by 10% in each of the next two years. The City has not explained how it \ncalculated those specific reductions (and has conceded that its derivation of these \nreductions was “not statistical,” Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 19), and has failed to provide a \ncomplete, precise list of factors the City considered and how it applied those \nfactors. Indeed, it appears that the 60% and 50% predictions are guesses.   \nThe basis for these predictions is even more puzzling considering that the \nCity had not yet identified which areas were slated for work in each of 2018 and \n2019 at the time the City submitted its Paragraph 30 Report. See Chaudhary Decl. \n   25 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8097    Page 34 of 40\nEx. 17. How could the City differentiate between the likelihood of discovering a \nlead or galvanized steel service line in 2018 versus 2019 when it had not even \ndetermined in which areas it would conduct excavations in each of those years?     \nThis is a dispositive problem, because the amount by which the hit rate will \ndecline will determine how much funding the City will need to complete the \nrequired service line replacements. The City anticipates that it will need all but \nroughly $528,000 of the available $97 million in funding. If the City’s hit rate \nestimates are wrong by just two percent, it will not have enough money.15  \nIII.  The City’s conclusion that it will not need additional funding to \ncomplete its obligations under the Agreement is invalid \n \nBecause the City’s conclusion about the total number of lead and galvanized \nsteel service lines is untenable, so too is its conclusion about the funding needed to \nreplace the remaining lines. The City’s calculations (which apply its unsupported \nhit rates, see supra pp. 20-26) indicate that it expects to replace only 5169 more \nservice lines in 2018 and 2019. See Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 8 at 2, 4. The City’s cost \nestimates indicate that if the City completes 913716 more excavations and replaces \n                                                            \n15 6000 excavations in 2018 * 62% hit rate = 3720 replacements, 120 more than \nthe City anticipates. 3173 excavations in 2019 * 52% hit rate = 1650 replacements, \n63 more than the City anticipates. Thus, if the City’s hit rates are 2% too low, it \nwill need to complete an additional 183 replacements, requiring $912,255 \n(assuming $4985 per replacement).  \n16 Again, the City’s arithmetic appears incorrect. The City’s budget chart \nreports that it will conduct 9137 more excavations, Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 8 at 4, \n   26 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8098    Page 35 of 40\nan additional 5169 pipes, it will have only $528,000 left of the $97 million, plus an \nadditional $2 million the City budgeted for “[c]onstruction contingenc[ies].” See \nid.; see supra pp. 8-9. Assuming there are no other construction contingencies \nrequiring extra expenses, this remaining funding will cover at most an additional \n507 replacements. See supra note 7.  \nBut the City cannot draw a valid conclusion about the funding needed until it \nhas a sound estimate for how many pipes it must excavate and replace. As \nexplained supra pp. 14-17, the City’s calculations considered only 18,000 homes \nin Flint, and ignored the remaining 10,400 homes by virtue of its manipulated \nformula. Its projected hit rates for work expected in 2018 and 2019 are also \nunsupported. See supra pp. 20-26. As a result, the City’s estimates about the \nnumber of lead and galvanized pipes to be replaced are likely off by thousands. \nThe City will run out of money. The Court must therefore reject the City’s \nconclusion that the $97 million in available funding will be sufficient to complete \nthe required excavations and pipe replacements.  \nIV.  A revised evaluation is necessary to implement the Agreement  \n \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to implement the Agreement to preserve the \npositions for which the parties bargained and ensure that the City conducts enough \n                                                            \ntransposing two digits from the statement earlier in its Report that it will complete \n9173 more excavations (the latter number is also incorrect, see supra note 5). \n   27 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8099    Page 36 of 40\nexcavations to identify and replace Flint’s lead and galvanized steel service lines. \nPlaintiffs therefore request that the Court order the City to revise its Paragraph 30 \nReport using one of the methods described below.  \nCreation of a sound predictive model. Plaintiffs request that the Court order \nthe City to create a sound model that will predict the total number of lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines in Flint as of March 28, 2017. The City has said that \nit does not have staff with the relevant expertise to conduct statistical modeling. \nChaudhary Decl. ¶ 19. Thus, Plaintiffs request that the Court order the City to hire \na consultant (a statistician) with expertise in predictive modeling to construct and \nrun the model. The City must ensure that the statistician uses well-documented and \nwell-established statistical methods to support his or her modeling decisions.  \nBefore running the model, the City should provide to all parties for review \nand comment a clear and complete description of all analytical assumptions and \nmethods in the proposed model, and Plaintiffs ask that the Court provide the \nparties an opportunity to raise objections to the proposed model. The Court should \nthen require the City to update its predictions with the model results, and to \nrecalculate a data-informed estimate of the total number of replacement eligible \nhomes with service lines needing replacement. The Court should require the City \nto revise its Paragraph 30 Report using the model results, and to include with the \nrevised Report all explanatory and outcome data in addition to the model’s results. \n   28 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8100    Page 37 of 40\nIn light of the City’s persistent failure to meet deadlines imposed under the \nAgreement, see Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agmt. 4-14, ECF No. 155, \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue the following interim deadlines \nto ensure that the City promptly completes the modeling work:   \n•  8/22/2018, or 1 week after this Court’s order on the motion (whichever is \nearlier): The City must propose 3 experts for the project \n•  1 week thereafter: The parties must agree on an expert for the project \n•  2 weeks thereafter: The City must submit the proposed model to all \nparties for review and comment  \n•  1 week thereafter: Plaintiffs and the State provide comments and/or raise \nobjections on proposed model  \n•  1 week thereafter: The parties resolve any comments and objections on \nthe proposed model from Plaintiffs or the State  \n•  2 weeks thereafter: The City must submit a revised Paragraph 30 Report  \n \nExpediently fixing the problems with the City’s Paragraph 30 Report is critical \nbecause the City has already begun conducting excavations for the second of the \nthree years of work under the Agreement. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. 23. The City has \nalready begun to plan for both the second and third years of work (2018 and 2019).   \n  Application of the observed hit rate. If the City declines to conduct the \nmodeling analysis described above, or fails to meet any of the deadlines ordered by \nthe Court, then Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court order the City to revise \nits Paragraph 30 Report by applying the observed hit rate to date to the total \nnumber of occupied homes at which the City has not yet conducted excavations. \nAs described above, the City has not used all its data to assess whether the \n   29 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 166   filed 06/21/18    PageID.8101    Page 38 of 40\nfactors it purports to rely on (such as the age of nearby fire hydrants or city \nrecords) are in fact good predictors of the presence of service lines needing \nreplacement. See Woods Decl. ¶¶ 12-22. In the absence of this assessment, the \nobserved hit rate (70.7% as of Feb. 8, 2018) is a sound predictor of the future hit \nrate. Id. ¶¶ 52-56. Indeed, in a May 2018 letter to EPA, the City applied exactly the \napproach Plaintiffs suggest, using a 70% projected hit rate to conclude that the City \n“has approximately 14,000 lead, galvanized or other left to replace.” Chaudhary \nDecl. Ex. 19. Applying the 70.7% hit rate yields an estimate of 20,083 total lead \nand galvanized steel service lines as of March 28, 2017. Woods Decl. ¶ 57.    \nThis is likely a conservative approach. But see id. ¶ 57 nn.15 & 18. The City \nmay have access to data that would support different assumptions and ultimately \nyield a lower estimate for the total number of lead and galvanized steel service \nlines in Flint. But the City has failed to provide any such data, or any support for \napplying a different hit rate, despite Plaintiffs’ repeated requests. See, e.g., \nChaudhary Decl. Exs. 9, 12 at 2-3, 15 at 4; Woods Decl. ¶ 13.  \nCONCLUSION \n   \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that the Court order the above-\ndescribed relief to enforce the Settlement Agreement. \nDated:   June 21, 2018          Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Sarah C.

Honorable David M. Lawson \n \nNICK A. KHOURI, FREDERICK HEADEN,  \nMICHAEL A. TOWNSEND, JOEL  \nFERGUSON, MICHAEL A. FINNEY,  \nSYLVESTER JONES, and CITY OF FLINT, \n \n  Defendants. \n__________________________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ FIFTH MOTION \nTO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n  The City of Flint continues to miss deadlines for completing the water service line \nreplacement work it promised to do when it entered into a Settlement Agreement on March 28, \n2017.  Those original deadlines have been extended several times.  Among the tasks that the City \npromised to perform were to identify and replace lead service lines for thousands of Flint \nresidences, restore the property after the excavations, and furnish reports of its work.  In their \ncontinuing efforts to secure the Agreement’s benefits to the residents of Flint, the plaintiffs have \nfiled their fifth enforcement motion, alleging that the City has violated and is violating the \nagreement  by  (1)  failing  to  complete  the  remaining  required  service  line  excavations  and \nreplacements by the latest Court-ordered deadline of September 30, 2022; (2) failing to track and \nmaintain records of the addresses where the City has completed restoration; (3) neglecting to \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11673   Filed 02/24/23   Page 2 of 26\nprovide timely monthly reports, including cumulative lists of all addresses where the City has \ncompleted restoration; and (4) failing to complete the remaining required restoration work.   \n  The defendants do not dispute these allegations.  After the motion was filed, the parties \nagreed to most of the relief proposed by the plaintiffs, with one exception.  A dispute remains \nregarding a proposed procedure for remedying the City’s incomplete restoration efforts.   \n  The Court held a hearing on the remaining disputed item on February 15, 2023.  The City \nargued that the remedial measures proposed by the plaintiffs would expand its obligations beyond \nthat called for by the Settlement Agreement and would create an intolerable burden on its limited \nresources.  However, the City put itself in this position by its mismanagement of the service line \nreplacement process, it has grossly exaggerated the “burden” that would be imposed by the \ninspection and notice procedures proposed by the plaintiffs, and those remedial measures are well \nwithin  the  means  available  to  the  Court  to  enforce  the  Settlement  Agreement  it  has  been \nsupervising for almost five years.  The plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement \nwill be granted.   \nI. \n  The plaintiffs filed their latest enforcement motion on November 1, 2022, pointing out the \nfailures listed above.  The parties have agreed to most of the plaintiffs’ proposals to address these \nconcerns, but a dispute remains over a proposed procedure for inspecting and restoring certain \nproperty excavations.   \n  The Settlement Agreement initially required the City of Flint to complete service line \nexcavations for at least 18,000 eligible homes in Flint and replace those lines composed of lead or \ngalvanized steel by January 1, 2020.  In August 2020, adopting a stipulation of the parties, the \nCourt modified the Settlement Agreement to establish a new, November 20, 2020 deadline by \n-2- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11674   Filed 02/24/23   Page 3 of 26\nwhich the City would complete all remaining excavation and replacement work.  Aug. 2020 \nModification  Order,  ¶  1,  ECF  No.  217,  PageID.10409.    The  modification  specified  that \n“completion of an excavation or service line replacement includes completion of restoration work \nat the address,” ibid., and required the City to report monthly cumulative lists of the homes where \nrestoration work had been completed, id. at ¶ 7, PageID.10413.  However, the City has failed to \nfurnish monthly lists to the plaintiffs; it has provided a cumulative list of restored homes only \ntwice,  most  recently  in  July  2021.    See  May  2021  Notice  of  Violation,  ECF  No.  242-2, \nPageID.11374; October 2022 Notice of Violation, ECF No. 242-4, PageID.11377. \n  In April 2022, the parties again stipulated to a new deadline — September 30, 2022 — for \ncompleting all excavations and service-line replacements.  Again, the Court approved the modified \ndeadline.  Apr. 2022 Modification Order, ¶ 1, ECF No. 237, PageID.11071.  Based on the parties’ \nstipulation and the City’s efforts to re-bid its restoration contracts, however, the Court did not \nmodify the deadline for completing restoration work.  Instead, the parties broadly agreed that “[t]he \nCity shall complete restoration at every address where it has conducted or conducts an excavation \npursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as modified.”  Id. at ¶ 2.  They also agreed that they would \nlater jointly file a stipulation specifying an agreed-upon modification for the restoration deadline.  \nId. at ¶ 6, PageID.11074-75.  Because no such stipulation has been filed, the plaintiffs now invoke \nthe Settlement Agreement’s dispute resolution provisions to ensure the City’s compliance with its \nrestoration obligations.  See ibid.; 5th Mot. to Enforce, ECF No. 242, PageID.11109.   \n  The City acknowledges that, as the result of certain decisions made from 2017 through \n2019 regarding restoration activities, its recordkeeping is incomplete, and it does not know the \nexact status of restoration at certain previously-excavated addresses.  See Resp., ECF No. 248, \nPageID.11560; October 2022 Notice of Violation, ECF No. 242-4, PageID.11380.  It has suggested \n-3- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11675   Filed 02/24/23   Page 4 of 26\nto the plaintiffs that the only way for it accurately to assess the scope of restoration work remaining \nis to visually inspect thousands of previously-excavated homes to confirm whether restoration in \nfact was completed and retroactively deem homes restored.  The City therefore agreed to take \ncertain actions in response to the plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement to \ndemonstrate completion of its obligation to restore the lawn, curb, sidewalk, and driveway at the \naddresses where it has excavated and replaced service lines.  See Stip. to Modify, ¶ 16, ECF No. \n256, PageID.11625-26.  For each address where restoration has been completed as called for by \nthe  Settlement  Agreement,  the  City  will  provide  either  contemporaneous  documentation  of \ncompleted restoration or make an in-person visual inspection.  Id. at ¶ 16, PageID.11625-26.  The \nvisual inspection shall verify that  \n(a) no asphalt, concrete, or other debris remains; (b) the address has a complete, \nuniform sidewalk with no gaps or holes, and the sidewalk is uniform in both grade \nand alignment; (c) the address has a complete, uniform driveway with no gaps or \nholes, and the driveway is uniform in both grade and alignment; (d) the address has \na complete, uniform curb, with no gaps or missing pieces, and the curb has a \nuniform grade and alignment; (e) the lawn is free of holes or trenches and is of a \nuniform grade, with no visible depressions; (f) any visible topsoil on the greenbelt \nor lawn is free of debris and the greenbelt or lawn has a consistent and uniform \nplant cover; and (g) the water shut-off valve is flush with the surface of the lawn \nand does not pose a tripping hazard. \n \nIdi. at PageID.11626-27.  The City also has agreed to take a photo or photos to document the \ncondition of the property, to provide the plaintiffs with the photos upon request, and to make \nmonthly reports to the plaintiffs of the restored homes.  Ibid.  With each monthly report, the City \nwill provide the plaintiffs with any emails and any logged calls it received during the reporting \nperiod from residents concerning the visual inspections.  Id. at ¶ 18, PageID.11628. \n  In addition to this agreed-upon relief, the plaintiffs propose a notice requirement:  They \nask that the Court order that, if the City conducts a visual inspection of an address and determines \nthat no further restoration is needed, the City leave a door hanger at that address notifying the \n-4- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11676   Filed 02/24/23   Page 5 of 26\nresident of its determination.  5th Mot. to Enforce, ¶ 6, ECF No. 242, PageID.11121.  The plaintiffs \nfurther propose that the City take and maintain a photo of every such door hanger left on a \nresidence and include on the door hanger a City phone number and email address that residents \nmay use to contact the City if they disagree with the City’s determination or have any questions.  \nSee Stip. to Modify, ECF No. 256, PageID.11629-30.  By the plaintiffs’ accounting, there are \napproximately 6,000 residences in Flint where the City lacks a contemporaneous record of \nrestoration.  Rolnick Decl., ¶ 4, ECF No. 242-2, PageID.11128-29.  The owner of one such \nresidence, Sidney Hemphill, submitted a declaration stating that the City twice dug up her front \nyard and sidewalk to replace, then fix, her service line in 2019.  Hemphill Decl., ECF No. 257-3, \nPageID.11650-51.    The  City  never  returned  to  restore  Hemphill’s  property  or  otherwise \ncommunicated with her.  Ibid.  Hemphill states that she would like to be notified if the City decides \nthat it will not complete restoration so that she can contact the City to protest its decision and \ndecide whether to complete the restoration work herself.  Id. at PageID.11652. \n  The City opposes the new proposed door hanger notice procedure as unduly burdensome \nand outside the parameters of the Settlement Agreement.  In support of its argument, it presented \nan affidavit of its Director Public Works, Michael J. Brown, attesting that the requirement would \n“impose an undue and heavy burden on the City.”  Brown Aff., ¶ 9, ECF No. 248-1, PageID.11564.  \nBrown explains in the affidavit that the extent of the restoration issue is unknown, as is the number \nof employees that would be needed to print door hangers and personally deliver them to thousands \nof addresses.  Id. at ¶¶ 10-11.  He also explains that it would be time-consuming for the City to \nrespond to the calls and emails from residents in response to the door hangers.  Id. at ¶ 12, \nPageID.11565.  Drawing upon his prior experience with this matter and other large-scale public-\n-5- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11677   Filed 02/24/23   Page 6 of 26\nworks projects, Brown concluded that the proposed notice process would “impose a tremendous \nfinancial and time burden upon the City.”  Id. at ¶ 13.   \n  The plaintiffs point out that the City previously has agreed to leave door hangers on homes \nto fulfill its obligations under the Settlement Agreement.  The original agreement, for example, \nobligated Community Outreach and Resident Education (CORE) teams to leave door hangers with \ninformation about faucet filters when they failed to make contact with eligible households, or when \nresidents refused filter inspections.  Agreement, ¶¶ 75, 80, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7394, 7400.  \nLater, the parties also stipulated to amend the settlement agreement to require the City to leave \ndoor hangers on service line-replacement-eligible households.  See Jul. 2018 Modification Order, \nECF No. 174, PageID.8711; Aug. 2020 Modification Order, ¶ 6, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  \nThe amendment requires the City to “undertake reasonable efforts to schedule a time to complete \nthe work” at each address where the resident has given the City permission “to conduct an \nexcavation and replacement (if necessary).”  Ibid.  If the City is unsuccessful at contacting said \nresidents, the amendment requires the City to “leave a door hanger with information explaining \nthat the City is trying to contact the resident to schedule a time to conduct the excavation and \nreplacement (if necessary) and providing information about how the resident can schedule the \nwork.”  Ibid. \n  The plaintiffs sought leave to take Brown’s deposition to inquire about the conclusory \nstatement he made in his affidavit about the burdens imposed by the proposed notification \nprocedure.  The Court granted that request over the City’s objection, and Brown sat for a deposition \non January 10, 2023.  His responses to the questioning revealed that Brown was not very careful \nwith the underlying facts when he drafted his affidavit.  He testified, for example, that he \nunderstood that the proposed notification procedure would require the City to evaluate past \n-6- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11678   Filed 02/24/23   Page 7 of 26\nrestoration work, update records, and provide notice to every home where an excavation had been \ncompleted.  Brown dep., ECF No. 257-4, PageID.11657-61, 11671.  He thus believed “that there \nwas going to be this much larger job scope of work that needed to be done,” which would prevent \nhis department from successfully evaluating and putting a door hanger on “every single house” \nasking people if they were “satisfied” with whatever restoration work had been done.  Id. at \nPageID.11567-69.  However, Brown admitted that he had not actually evaluated the costs of a door \nhanger program, calculated the personnel time that would be required to perform in-person visual \ninspections, or consulted any other data.  Id. at PageID.11661, 11665-67.  He also admitted that \nhe was not aware that the City already planned on going to the relevant homes in person to \ncomplete visual inspections of the properties.  Id. at PageID.11660-64.  If the City already had \nagreed to complete visual inspections, Brown allowed that it would take “a small amount of time \nprobably to go and put the door hanger on the door.”  Id. at PageID.11664.  And Brown admitted \nthat if residents reached out to the City to report mistakes made during the restoration process, it \nwas “quite probable” that the City would benefit by learning where additional servicing work is \nneeded.  Id. at PageID.11669-70.  \n  Despite the undermining of Brown’s affidavit and his acknowledgements at the deposition, \nthe City persisted in its argument at the hearing that the inspection and door-hanger notification \nprocedure proposed by the plaintiffs poses an unreasonable burden on the City.   \nII. \n  The Settlement Agreement states that the dispute resolution mechanism outlined there is \nthe “sole and exclusive mechanism” for resolving disputes and disagreements arising out of the \nAgreement, and that the Court has jurisdiction to enforce its terms.  Settlement Agreement, ¶¶ 125-\n26, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7423.  It also states that no modification may be made to the \n-7- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11679   Filed 02/24/23   Page 8 of 26\nAgreement absent a “joint stipulation of all of the Parties and a Court order.”  Id. at ¶ 138, \nPageID.7426-27. \n  In most cases, as here, the settlement results in the dismissal of a lawsuit.  Thereafter, “[t]he \ncourt must enforce the settlement as agreed to by the parties and is not permitted to alter the terms \nof the agreement.”  Brock v. Scheuner Corp., 841 F.2d 151, 154 (6th Cir. 1988).  “There is a deeply \nembedded judicial and legislative policy in favor of keeping final judgments final.” Cummings v. \nGreater Cleveland Reg. Transit Auth., 865 F.3d 844, 846 (6th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).  “That \nis especially true for settlement agreements.”  Ibid.  However, the Sixth Circuit has explained that \na district court possesses broad, inherent authority and equitable power to enforce the terms of a \nsettlement agreement entered into by the parties to litigation.  Brock, 841 F.2d at 154.   \n  A settlement agreement in essence is a contract.  Cogent Sols. Grp., LLC v. Hyalogic, LLC, \n712 F.3d 305, 309 (6th Cir. 2013).  When enforcing a contract, the first objective is to “honor the \nintent of the parties,” Rasheed v. Chrysler Corp., 445 Mich. 109, 127 n.28, 517 N.W.2d 19, 29 \nn.28 (1994), and the prime source of that intent is the plain language of the agreement, Wilkie v. \nAuto-Owners Ins. Co., 469 Mich. 41, 61, 664 N.W.2d 776, 787 (2003) (“Well-settled principles of \ncontract interpretation require one to first look to a contract’s plain language.”).   \n  As the Court explained when dealing with earlier enforcement motions in this case, the \nSettlement Agreement entered by the parties operates as a consent decree — that is, a “settlement \nagreement subject to continued judicial policing.”  Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, \n23 F.3d 1013, 1017 (6th Cir. 1994) (quoting Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. \n1983)).  A consent decree is “a strange hybrid in the law,” Lorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., \n979 F.2d 1141, 1149 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir. 1981), \nin that it is “at once ‘a voluntary settlement agreement which could be fully effective without \n-8- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11680   Filed 02/24/23   Page 9 of 26\njudicial intervention’ and ‘a final judicial order . . . plac[ing] the power and prestige of the court \nbehind the compromise struck by the parties,’” ibid. (quoting Williams, 720 F.2d at 920).  Consent \ndecrees therefore “may be ‘treated as contracts for some purposes but not for others.’”  Ibid. \n(quoting United States v. ITT Continental Baking, 420 U.S. 223, 236 n.10 (1975).  The “scope of \na consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not by reference to what might \nsatisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it or by what might have been written had the plaintiff \nestablished his factual claims and legal theories in litigation.”  Ibid. (quoting Firefighters Local \nUnion No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 574 (1984) (internal quotations omitted)).  But a consent \ndecree also “should be construed to preserve the position for which the parties bargained.”  \nVanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Vogel v. City of Cincinnati, 959 F.2d 594, 598 (6th Cir.), \ncert. denied, 506 U.S. 827 (1992).  Thus, courts effectuating the purposes or accomplishing the \ngoals of a decree “are not bound under all circumstances by the terms contained within the four \ncorners of the parties’ agreement,” Lorain NAACP, 979 F.2d at 1149, but rather, in enforcing a \nconsent decree, may exercise “broad equitable remedial powers,” Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 \nF.3d 523, 532-33 (6th Cir. 2012).   \n  A court’s power to enforce a consent decree includes the “inherent equitable power to \nmodify  a  consent  decree  if  satisfied  that  the  decree  ‘has  been  turned  through  changing \ncircumstances into an instrument of wrong.’”  Waste Mgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 \nF.3d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Knote, 29 F.3d 1297, 1302 (8th Cir. \n1994)).  This power arises from the “injunctive quality of a consent decree,” which “compels the \napproving court to . . . modify the decree if ‘changed circumstances’ subvert its intended purpose.”  \nVanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Williams, 720 F.2d at 920).  “[E]ven if the consent decree \ndoes not expressly grant the district court jurisdiction to modify the decree, it is well-settled that \n-9- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11681   Filed 02/24/23   Page 10 of 26\n‘courts retain the inherent power to enforce agreements entered into in settlement of litigation \npending before them.’”  Ibid. (quoting Sarabia v. Toledo Police Patrolman’s Ass’n, 601 F.2d 914, \n917 (6th Cir. 1979)).  Whether a situation rises to the level where judicial modification is \nappropriate “is a factual issue for the district court to decide in the first instance.”  Waste Mgmt. of \nOhio, 132 F.3d at 1146. \n  The plaintiffs do not contend that the proposed door hanger notification procedure is \nexplicitly required by the language of the Settlement Agreement.  Rather, they contend that the \nCourt  properly  may  impose  the  procedure  to  enforce  what  the  Settlement  Agreement \nunambiguously  requires:  that  the  City  “complete  restoration  at  every  address  where  it  has \nconducted  or  conducts  an  excavation,”  Apr.  2022  Modification  Order,  ¶  2,  ECF  No.  237, \nPageID.11071, while maintaining monthly records of its progress, Aug. 2020 Modification Order, \n¶ 7, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  Because the City has not done what it has promised to do, and \nit has not even kept records of the work it has completed, it is appropriate to install a sensible \nenforcement device to see that the City’s performance of its part of the agreement is achieved.    \n  The Settlement Agreement plainly contemplates that the Court will enforce its terms by \nresolving  disputes  among  the  parties.    Settlement  Agreement,  ¶¶  125-30,  ECF  No.  147-1, \nPageID.7423-24.  Because it does not otherwise “specify the consequences of a breach,” it \nimplicitly leaves the remedies for breach to the Court’s “equitable discretion.”  Cook v. City of \nChicago, 192 F.3d 693, 698 (7th Cir. 1999).  That discretion is significant, ibid., and may include \nthe imposition of “additional affirmative conduct” not required by the underlying agreement, \nRoman v. Korson, 307 F. Supp. 2d 908, 919 (W.D. Mich. 2004) (citing In re Arthur Teacher's \nFranchise Litig., 689 F.2d 1150, 1158 (3rd Cir. 1982); N.L.R.B. v. J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc., 563 \nF.2d 8, 15 (2d Cir. 1977)).  \n-10- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11682   Filed 02/24/23   Page 11 of 26\n  The City plainly is struggling to comply with the Settlement Agreement’s restoration \nrequirements.  It admits that it does not know the scope of the restoration it already has completed \nand that visual inspections of thousands of residences are necessary to determine which addresses \nhave been restored.  It also admits that it has performed excavations and service line replacements \nat certain addresses without also performing any or all restoration work.  See Resp., ECF No. 248, \nPageID.11560.  That, in fact, appears to be what is motivating the City’s opposition to the door \nhanger proposal: it fears that residents will call to lodge complaints about the City’s incomplete \nrestoration work and that it might feel the need to respond to many of those calls.  The plaintiffs \nreasonably interpret the City’s opposition as an effort to avoid its obligation to restore every \nproperty it excavated.   \n  The plaintiffs’ concern that the City will not accurately determine whether restoration has \nbeen completed in every case also is well-founded.  This is the fifth occasion in which the plaintiffs \nhave been obliged to seek judicial relief in aid of the Settlement Agreement to remedy the City’s \nrepeated failure to meet Court-ordered deadlines for completing excavation and service line \nreplacement.  Again, that work, per the terms of the Settlement Agreement, “includes completion \nof  restoration  work”  at  each  address.  Aug.  2020  Modification  Order,  ¶  1,  ECF  No.  217, \nPageID.10409.  It therefore is within the Court’s discretion to impose “more stringent and \ncomplete measures” than it previously ordered to ensure the City restores properties excavated \npursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  Screw Mach. Tool Co. v. Slater Tool & Eng’g Corp., 683 \nF.2d 159, 163 (6th Cir. 1982).  “[B]road” equitable relief is appropriate to remedy the latest \nviolations of the agreement “in the light of the violations which preceded them.”  Ibid. \n  The City’s argument that the notification procedure is unduly onerous is belied by the \ntestimony of its own affiant, who stated that it would take little time to leave a door hanger at each \n-11- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11683   Filed 02/24/23   Page 12 of 26\nresidence the City visually inspects.  Moreover, the City already has contemplated that it will \nreceive comments from property owners from its visual inspections, and it committed to provide \na record of said concerns to the plaintiffs on a monthly basis.  Stip. to Modify, ¶ 18, ECF No. 256, \nPageID.11628.  The City also has committed to leave door hangers at certain properties per the \nterms of the modified Settlement Agreement.  See Jul. 2018 Modification Order, ECF No. 174, \nPageID.8711; Aug. 2020 Modification Order, ¶ 6, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  Leaving door \nhangers  with  information  about  the  City’s  restoration  efforts  is  in  keeping  with  those \ncommitments.   \n   When enforcing a settlement agreement, as with a contract, the first objective is to “honor \nthe intent of the parties.”  Rasheed v. Chrysler Corp., 445 Mich. 109, 127 n.28, 517 N.W.2d 19, \n29 n.28 (1994).  The City intended to restore every property it excavated per the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement.  The plaintiffs’ requested notice remedy appears reasonably tailored to \naddress the City’s failure to honor that intention — and, perhaps, its efforts to avoid doing so.   \nIII. \n  The  parties’  stipulation  filed  in  response  to  this  fifth  enforcement  motion  outlines \nappropriate procedures to bring current the City’s responsibilities.  The plaintiffs also have \ndemonstrated that they are entitled to the relief they request to enforce the terms of this Settlement \nAgreement that is so important to the welfare of the City’s residents, and which promotes the \ninterests of the City and the State of Michigan in restoring confidence in the municipal water \nsystem.   \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement (ECF No. 242) is GRANTED.     \n-12- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11684   Filed 02/24/23   Page 13 of 26\n  It is further ORDERED that the City of Flint shall complete excavations and replace \nservice lines made of lead or galvanized steel (excluding restoration) at all 31,578 replacement \neligible homes appearing on the “2022 Replacement Eligible Homes List,” which has been agreed \nto and exchanged among the Settling Parties, as quickly as practicable and by no later than August \n1, 2023.  \n  It is further ORDERED that, for addresses where the City has scheduled an excavation or \nreplacement, the day before each scheduled excavation or replacement, the City shall make a \ntelephone call to the resident at whose address an excavation is scheduled if the City has a contact \nphone number for the household.  This caller shall remind the resident of the scheduled excavation \nor replacement and inform the resident that if they are not home at the scheduled time, the City \nwill be unable to complete the work and the resident will be required to reschedule.  This reminder \nshall be conveyed through a voicemail if the resident does not answer the call.  The City shall \nmaintain a log documenting these calls, including the address(es) the calls concerned and whether \nthe caller spoke to the resident or left a voicemail, and shall provide this log to the plaintiffs upon \nrequest. \n  It is further ORDERED that, for addresses where the City has scheduled an excavation or \nreplacement with a resident, but the resident is not home at the time of the scheduled excavation \nand/or replacement, the City must undertake reasonable efforts to reschedule the work at that \naddress.  These reasonable efforts shall include, at minimum: \na.  If the City has not yet completed the minimum post-consent scheduling attempts \nrequired by Paragraph 6 of the August 24, 2020 Court order modifying the Agreement \n(“August 2020 Order”), ECF No. 217, Page ID.10413, the City must complete those \nattempts. \n-13- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11685   Filed 02/24/23   Page 14 of 26\nb.  The City must leave a door hanger (i) with information explaining that the City \nwas unable to complete a scheduled excavation and/or replacement because the resident \nwas not home and that the resident must reschedule with the City, and (ii) providing \ninformation about how the resident can reschedule the work.  The City shall take a photo \nof every door hanger it leaves to document compliance with this provision and provide \nthose photos to the plaintiffs upon request. \nc.  The City must make at least two telephone calls to the resident if the City has a \ncontact phone number for the household, one of which must occur the same day as the \nscheduled excavation and the second of which must occur between one and seven days \nafter the scheduled excavation.  The caller shall attempt to reschedule the work with the \nresident, and shall inform the resident that this is the City’s second-to-last or last attempt \n(as applicable) to reschedule, but that the resident may contact the City to schedule another \ntime to complete the work.  The caller shall convey this information by voicemail if the \nresident does not answer.  The City shall maintain a log documenting these calls and the \naddress(es) the calls concerned, including whether the caller spoke to the resident or left a \nvoicemail, whether the caller successfully rescheduled the work, and the date of the \nrescheduled work (if applicable), and shall provide this log to the plaintiffs upon request. \nd.  If the City does not have a contact phone number for the household, the City \nmust complete two additional in-person outreach attempts to reschedule the excavation \nand/or replacement beyond the minimum number of attempts required by Paragraph 6 of \nthe August 2020 Order.

FINNEY,  \nSYLVESTER JONES, and CITY OF FLINT, \n \n  Defendants. \n__________________________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ FIFTH MOTION \nTO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n  The City of Flint continues to miss deadlines for completing the water service line \nreplacement work it promised to do when it entered into a Settlement Agreement on March 28, \n2017.  Those original deadlines have been extended several times.  Among the tasks that the City \npromised to perform were to identify and replace lead service lines for thousands of Flint \nresidences, restore the property after the excavations, and furnish reports of its work.  In their \ncontinuing efforts to secure the Agreement’s benefits to the residents of Flint, the plaintiffs have \nfiled their fifth enforcement motion, alleging that the City has violated and is violating the \nagreement  by  (1)  failing  to  complete  the  remaining  required  service  line  excavations  and \nreplacements by the latest Court-ordered deadline of September 30, 2022; (2) failing to track and \nmaintain records of the addresses where the City has completed restoration; (3) neglecting to \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11673   Filed 02/24/23   Page 2 of 26\nprovide timely monthly reports, including cumulative lists of all addresses where the City has \ncompleted restoration; and (4) failing to complete the remaining required restoration work.   \n  The defendants do not dispute these allegations.  After the motion was filed, the parties \nagreed to most of the relief proposed by the plaintiffs, with one exception.  A dispute remains \nregarding a proposed procedure for remedying the City’s incomplete restoration efforts.   \n  The Court held a hearing on the remaining disputed item on February 15, 2023.  The City \nargued that the remedial measures proposed by the plaintiffs would expand its obligations beyond \nthat called for by the Settlement Agreement and would create an intolerable burden on its limited \nresources.  However, the City put itself in this position by its mismanagement of the service line \nreplacement process, it has grossly exaggerated the “burden” that would be imposed by the \ninspection and notice procedures proposed by the plaintiffs, and those remedial measures are well \nwithin  the  means  available  to  the  Court  to  enforce  the  Settlement  Agreement  it  has  been \nsupervising for almost five years.  The plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement \nwill be granted.   \nI. \n  The plaintiffs filed their latest enforcement motion on November 1, 2022, pointing out the \nfailures listed above.  The parties have agreed to most of the plaintiffs’ proposals to address these \nconcerns, but a dispute remains over a proposed procedure for inspecting and restoring certain \nproperty excavations.   \n  The Settlement Agreement initially required the City of Flint to complete service line \nexcavations for at least 18,000 eligible homes in Flint and replace those lines composed of lead or \ngalvanized steel by January 1, 2020.  In August 2020, adopting a stipulation of the parties, the \nCourt modified the Settlement Agreement to establish a new, November 20, 2020 deadline by \n-2- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11674   Filed 02/24/23   Page 3 of 26\nwhich the City would complete all remaining excavation and replacement work.  Aug. 2020 \nModification  Order,  ¶  1,  ECF  No.  217,  PageID.10409.    The  modification  specified  that \n“completion of an excavation or service line replacement includes completion of restoration work \nat the address,” ibid., and required the City to report monthly cumulative lists of the homes where \nrestoration work had been completed, id. at ¶ 7, PageID.10413.  However, the City has failed to \nfurnish monthly lists to the plaintiffs; it has provided a cumulative list of restored homes only \ntwice,  most  recently  in  July  2021.    See  May  2021  Notice  of  Violation,  ECF  No.  242-2, \nPageID.11374; October 2022 Notice of Violation, ECF No. 242-4, PageID.11377. \n  In April 2022, the parties again stipulated to a new deadline — September 30, 2022 — for \ncompleting all excavations and service-line replacements.  Again, the Court approved the modified \ndeadline.  Apr. 2022 Modification Order, ¶ 1, ECF No. 237, PageID.11071.  Based on the parties’ \nstipulation and the City’s efforts to re-bid its restoration contracts, however, the Court did not \nmodify the deadline for completing restoration work.  Instead, the parties broadly agreed that “[t]he \nCity shall complete restoration at every address where it has conducted or conducts an excavation \npursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as modified.”  Id. at ¶ 2.  They also agreed that they would \nlater jointly file a stipulation specifying an agreed-upon modification for the restoration deadline.  \nId. at ¶ 6, PageID.11074-75.  Because no such stipulation has been filed, the plaintiffs now invoke \nthe Settlement Agreement’s dispute resolution provisions to ensure the City’s compliance with its \nrestoration obligations.  See ibid.; 5th Mot. to Enforce, ECF No. 242, PageID.11109.   \n  The City acknowledges that, as the result of certain decisions made from 2017 through \n2019 regarding restoration activities, its recordkeeping is incomplete, and it does not know the \nexact status of restoration at certain previously-excavated addresses.  See Resp., ECF No. 248, \nPageID.11560; October 2022 Notice of Violation, ECF No. 242-4, PageID.11380.  It has suggested \n-3- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11675   Filed 02/24/23   Page 4 of 26\nto the plaintiffs that the only way for it accurately to assess the scope of restoration work remaining \nis to visually inspect thousands of previously-excavated homes to confirm whether restoration in \nfact was completed and retroactively deem homes restored.  The City therefore agreed to take \ncertain actions in response to the plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement to \ndemonstrate completion of its obligation to restore the lawn, curb, sidewalk, and driveway at the \naddresses where it has excavated and replaced service lines.  See Stip. to Modify, ¶ 16, ECF No. \n256, PageID.11625-26.  For each address where restoration has been completed as called for by \nthe  Settlement  Agreement,  the  City  will  provide  either  contemporaneous  documentation  of \ncompleted restoration or make an in-person visual inspection.  Id. at ¶ 16, PageID.11625-26.  The \nvisual inspection shall verify that  \n(a) no asphalt, concrete, or other debris remains; (b) the address has a complete, \nuniform sidewalk with no gaps or holes, and the sidewalk is uniform in both grade \nand alignment; (c) the address has a complete, uniform driveway with no gaps or \nholes, and the driveway is uniform in both grade and alignment; (d) the address has \na complete, uniform curb, with no gaps or missing pieces, and the curb has a \nuniform grade and alignment; (e) the lawn is free of holes or trenches and is of a \nuniform grade, with no visible depressions; (f) any visible topsoil on the greenbelt \nor lawn is free of debris and the greenbelt or lawn has a consistent and uniform \nplant cover; and (g) the water shut-off valve is flush with the surface of the lawn \nand does not pose a tripping hazard. \n \nIdi. at PageID.11626-27.  The City also has agreed to take a photo or photos to document the \ncondition of the property, to provide the plaintiffs with the photos upon request, and to make \nmonthly reports to the plaintiffs of the restored homes.  Ibid.  With each monthly report, the City \nwill provide the plaintiffs with any emails and any logged calls it received during the reporting \nperiod from residents concerning the visual inspections.  Id. at ¶ 18, PageID.11628. \n  In addition to this agreed-upon relief, the plaintiffs propose a notice requirement:  They \nask that the Court order that, if the City conducts a visual inspection of an address and determines \nthat no further restoration is needed, the City leave a door hanger at that address notifying the \n-4- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11676   Filed 02/24/23   Page 5 of 26\nresident of its determination.  5th Mot. to Enforce, ¶ 6, ECF No. 242, PageID.11121.  The plaintiffs \nfurther propose that the City take and maintain a photo of every such door hanger left on a \nresidence and include on the door hanger a City phone number and email address that residents \nmay use to contact the City if they disagree with the City’s determination or have any questions.  \nSee Stip. to Modify, ECF No. 256, PageID.11629-30.  By the plaintiffs’ accounting, there are \napproximately 6,000 residences in Flint where the City lacks a contemporaneous record of \nrestoration.  Rolnick Decl., ¶ 4, ECF No. 242-2, PageID.11128-29.  The owner of one such \nresidence, Sidney Hemphill, submitted a declaration stating that the City twice dug up her front \nyard and sidewalk to replace, then fix, her service line in 2019.  Hemphill Decl., ECF No. 257-3, \nPageID.11650-51.    The  City  never  returned  to  restore  Hemphill’s  property  or  otherwise \ncommunicated with her.  Ibid.  Hemphill states that she would like to be notified if the City decides \nthat it will not complete restoration so that she can contact the City to protest its decision and \ndecide whether to complete the restoration work herself.  Id. at PageID.11652. \n  The City opposes the new proposed door hanger notice procedure as unduly burdensome \nand outside the parameters of the Settlement Agreement.  In support of its argument, it presented \nan affidavit of its Director Public Works, Michael J. Brown, attesting that the requirement would \n“impose an undue and heavy burden on the City.”  Brown Aff., ¶ 9, ECF No. 248-1, PageID.11564.  \nBrown explains in the affidavit that the extent of the restoration issue is unknown, as is the number \nof employees that would be needed to print door hangers and personally deliver them to thousands \nof addresses.  Id. at ¶¶ 10-11.  He also explains that it would be time-consuming for the City to \nrespond to the calls and emails from residents in response to the door hangers.  Id. at ¶ 12, \nPageID.11565.  Drawing upon his prior experience with this matter and other large-scale public-\n-5- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11677   Filed 02/24/23   Page 6 of 26\nworks projects, Brown concluded that the proposed notice process would “impose a tremendous \nfinancial and time burden upon the City.”  Id. at ¶ 13.   \n  The plaintiffs point out that the City previously has agreed to leave door hangers on homes \nto fulfill its obligations under the Settlement Agreement.  The original agreement, for example, \nobligated Community Outreach and Resident Education (CORE) teams to leave door hangers with \ninformation about faucet filters when they failed to make contact with eligible households, or when \nresidents refused filter inspections.  Agreement, ¶¶ 75, 80, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7394, 7400.  \nLater, the parties also stipulated to amend the settlement agreement to require the City to leave \ndoor hangers on service line-replacement-eligible households.  See Jul. 2018 Modification Order, \nECF No. 174, PageID.8711; Aug. 2020 Modification Order, ¶ 6, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  \nThe amendment requires the City to “undertake reasonable efforts to schedule a time to complete \nthe work” at each address where the resident has given the City permission “to conduct an \nexcavation and replacement (if necessary).”  Ibid.  If the City is unsuccessful at contacting said \nresidents, the amendment requires the City to “leave a door hanger with information explaining \nthat the City is trying to contact the resident to schedule a time to conduct the excavation and \nreplacement (if necessary) and providing information about how the resident can schedule the \nwork.”  Ibid. \n  The plaintiffs sought leave to take Brown’s deposition to inquire about the conclusory \nstatement he made in his affidavit about the burdens imposed by the proposed notification \nprocedure.  The Court granted that request over the City’s objection, and Brown sat for a deposition \non January 10, 2023.  His responses to the questioning revealed that Brown was not very careful \nwith the underlying facts when he drafted his affidavit.  He testified, for example, that he \nunderstood that the proposed notification procedure would require the City to evaluate past \n-6- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11678   Filed 02/24/23   Page 7 of 26\nrestoration work, update records, and provide notice to every home where an excavation had been \ncompleted.  Brown dep., ECF No. 257-4, PageID.11657-61, 11671.  He thus believed “that there \nwas going to be this much larger job scope of work that needed to be done,” which would prevent \nhis department from successfully evaluating and putting a door hanger on “every single house” \nasking people if they were “satisfied” with whatever restoration work had been done.  Id. at \nPageID.11567-69.  However, Brown admitted that he had not actually evaluated the costs of a door \nhanger program, calculated the personnel time that would be required to perform in-person visual \ninspections, or consulted any other data.  Id. at PageID.11661, 11665-67.  He also admitted that \nhe was not aware that the City already planned on going to the relevant homes in person to \ncomplete visual inspections of the properties.  Id. at PageID.11660-64.  If the City already had \nagreed to complete visual inspections, Brown allowed that it would take “a small amount of time \nprobably to go and put the door hanger on the door.”  Id. at PageID.11664.  And Brown admitted \nthat if residents reached out to the City to report mistakes made during the restoration process, it \nwas “quite probable” that the City would benefit by learning where additional servicing work is \nneeded.  Id. at PageID.11669-70.  \n  Despite the undermining of Brown’s affidavit and his acknowledgements at the deposition, \nthe City persisted in its argument at the hearing that the inspection and door-hanger notification \nprocedure proposed by the plaintiffs poses an unreasonable burden on the City.   \nII. \n  The Settlement Agreement states that the dispute resolution mechanism outlined there is \nthe “sole and exclusive mechanism” for resolving disputes and disagreements arising out of the \nAgreement, and that the Court has jurisdiction to enforce its terms.  Settlement Agreement, ¶¶ 125-\n26, ECF No. 147-1, PageID.7423.  It also states that no modification may be made to the \n-7- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11679   Filed 02/24/23   Page 8 of 26\nAgreement absent a “joint stipulation of all of the Parties and a Court order.”  Id. at ¶ 138, \nPageID.7426-27. \n  In most cases, as here, the settlement results in the dismissal of a lawsuit.  Thereafter, “[t]he \ncourt must enforce the settlement as agreed to by the parties and is not permitted to alter the terms \nof the agreement.”  Brock v. Scheuner Corp., 841 F.2d 151, 154 (6th Cir. 1988).  “There is a deeply \nembedded judicial and legislative policy in favor of keeping final judgments final.” Cummings v. \nGreater Cleveland Reg. Transit Auth., 865 F.3d 844, 846 (6th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).  “That \nis especially true for settlement agreements.”  Ibid.  However, the Sixth Circuit has explained that \na district court possesses broad, inherent authority and equitable power to enforce the terms of a \nsettlement agreement entered into by the parties to litigation.  Brock, 841 F.2d at 154.   \n  A settlement agreement in essence is a contract.  Cogent Sols. Grp., LLC v. Hyalogic, LLC, \n712 F.3d 305, 309 (6th Cir. 2013).  When enforcing a contract, the first objective is to “honor the \nintent of the parties,” Rasheed v. Chrysler Corp., 445 Mich. 109, 127 n.28, 517 N.W.2d 19, 29 \nn.28 (1994), and the prime source of that intent is the plain language of the agreement, Wilkie v. \nAuto-Owners Ins. Co., 469 Mich. 41, 61, 664 N.W.2d 776, 787 (2003) (“Well-settled principles of \ncontract interpretation require one to first look to a contract’s plain language.”).   \n  As the Court explained when dealing with earlier enforcement motions in this case, the \nSettlement Agreement entered by the parties operates as a consent decree — that is, a “settlement \nagreement subject to continued judicial policing.”  Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, \n23 F.3d 1013, 1017 (6th Cir. 1994) (quoting Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. \n1983)).  A consent decree is “a strange hybrid in the law,” Lorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., \n979 F.2d 1141, 1149 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir. 1981), \nin that it is “at once ‘a voluntary settlement agreement which could be fully effective without \n-8- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11680   Filed 02/24/23   Page 9 of 26\njudicial intervention’ and ‘a final judicial order . . . plac[ing] the power and prestige of the court \nbehind the compromise struck by the parties,’” ibid. (quoting Williams, 720 F.2d at 920).  Consent \ndecrees therefore “may be ‘treated as contracts for some purposes but not for others.’”  Ibid. \n(quoting United States v. ITT Continental Baking, 420 U.S. 223, 236 n.10 (1975).  The “scope of \na consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not by reference to what might \nsatisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it or by what might have been written had the plaintiff \nestablished his factual claims and legal theories in litigation.”  Ibid. (quoting Firefighters Local \nUnion No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 574 (1984) (internal quotations omitted)).  But a consent \ndecree also “should be construed to preserve the position for which the parties bargained.”  \nVanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Vogel v. City of Cincinnati, 959 F.2d 594, 598 (6th Cir.), \ncert. denied, 506 U.S. 827 (1992).  Thus, courts effectuating the purposes or accomplishing the \ngoals of a decree “are not bound under all circumstances by the terms contained within the four \ncorners of the parties’ agreement,” Lorain NAACP, 979 F.2d at 1149, but rather, in enforcing a \nconsent decree, may exercise “broad equitable remedial powers,” Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 \nF.3d 523, 532-33 (6th Cir. 2012).   \n  A court’s power to enforce a consent decree includes the “inherent equitable power to \nmodify  a  consent  decree  if  satisfied  that  the  decree  ‘has  been  turned  through  changing \ncircumstances into an instrument of wrong.’”  Waste Mgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 \nF.3d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Knote, 29 F.3d 1297, 1302 (8th Cir. \n1994)).  This power arises from the “injunctive quality of a consent decree,” which “compels the \napproving court to . . . modify the decree if ‘changed circumstances’ subvert its intended purpose.”  \nVanguards, 23 F.3d at 1018 (quoting Williams, 720 F.2d at 920).  “[E]ven if the consent decree \ndoes not expressly grant the district court jurisdiction to modify the decree, it is well-settled that \n-9- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11681   Filed 02/24/23   Page 10 of 26\n‘courts retain the inherent power to enforce agreements entered into in settlement of litigation \npending before them.’”  Ibid. (quoting Sarabia v. Toledo Police Patrolman’s Ass’n, 601 F.2d 914, \n917 (6th Cir. 1979)).  Whether a situation rises to the level where judicial modification is \nappropriate “is a factual issue for the district court to decide in the first instance.”  Waste Mgmt. of \nOhio, 132 F.3d at 1146. \n  The plaintiffs do not contend that the proposed door hanger notification procedure is \nexplicitly required by the language of the Settlement Agreement.  Rather, they contend that the \nCourt  properly  may  impose  the  procedure  to  enforce  what  the  Settlement  Agreement \nunambiguously  requires:  that  the  City  “complete  restoration  at  every  address  where  it  has \nconducted  or  conducts  an  excavation,”  Apr.  2022  Modification  Order,  ¶  2,  ECF  No.  237, \nPageID.11071, while maintaining monthly records of its progress, Aug. 2020 Modification Order, \n¶ 7, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  Because the City has not done what it has promised to do, and \nit has not even kept records of the work it has completed, it is appropriate to install a sensible \nenforcement device to see that the City’s performance of its part of the agreement is achieved.    \n  The Settlement Agreement plainly contemplates that the Court will enforce its terms by \nresolving  disputes  among  the  parties.    Settlement  Agreement,  ¶¶  125-30,  ECF  No.  147-1, \nPageID.7423-24.  Because it does not otherwise “specify the consequences of a breach,” it \nimplicitly leaves the remedies for breach to the Court’s “equitable discretion.”  Cook v. City of \nChicago, 192 F.3d 693, 698 (7th Cir. 1999).  That discretion is significant, ibid., and may include \nthe imposition of “additional affirmative conduct” not required by the underlying agreement, \nRoman v. Korson, 307 F. Supp. 2d 908, 919 (W.D. Mich. 2004) (citing In re Arthur Teacher's \nFranchise Litig., 689 F.2d 1150, 1158 (3rd Cir. 1982); N.L.R.B. v. J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc., 563 \nF.2d 8, 15 (2d Cir. 1977)).  \n-10- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11682   Filed 02/24/23   Page 11 of 26\n  The City plainly is struggling to comply with the Settlement Agreement’s restoration \nrequirements.  It admits that it does not know the scope of the restoration it already has completed \nand that visual inspections of thousands of residences are necessary to determine which addresses \nhave been restored.  It also admits that it has performed excavations and service line replacements \nat certain addresses without also performing any or all restoration work.  See Resp., ECF No. 248, \nPageID.11560.  That, in fact, appears to be what is motivating the City’s opposition to the door \nhanger proposal: it fears that residents will call to lodge complaints about the City’s incomplete \nrestoration work and that it might feel the need to respond to many of those calls.  The plaintiffs \nreasonably interpret the City’s opposition as an effort to avoid its obligation to restore every \nproperty it excavated.   \n  The plaintiffs’ concern that the City will not accurately determine whether restoration has \nbeen completed in every case also is well-founded.  This is the fifth occasion in which the plaintiffs \nhave been obliged to seek judicial relief in aid of the Settlement Agreement to remedy the City’s \nrepeated failure to meet Court-ordered deadlines for completing excavation and service line \nreplacement.  Again, that work, per the terms of the Settlement Agreement, “includes completion \nof  restoration  work”  at  each  address.  Aug.  2020  Modification  Order,  ¶  1,  ECF  No.  217, \nPageID.10409.  It therefore is within the Court’s discretion to impose “more stringent and \ncomplete measures” than it previously ordered to ensure the City restores properties excavated \npursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  Screw Mach. Tool Co. v. Slater Tool & Eng’g Corp., 683 \nF.2d 159, 163 (6th Cir. 1982).  “[B]road” equitable relief is appropriate to remedy the latest \nviolations of the agreement “in the light of the violations which preceded them.”  Ibid. \n  The City’s argument that the notification procedure is unduly onerous is belied by the \ntestimony of its own affiant, who stated that it would take little time to leave a door hanger at each \n-11- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11683   Filed 02/24/23   Page 12 of 26\nresidence the City visually inspects.  Moreover, the City already has contemplated that it will \nreceive comments from property owners from its visual inspections, and it committed to provide \na record of said concerns to the plaintiffs on a monthly basis.  Stip. to Modify, ¶ 18, ECF No. 256, \nPageID.11628.  The City also has committed to leave door hangers at certain properties per the \nterms of the modified Settlement Agreement.  See Jul. 2018 Modification Order, ECF No. 174, \nPageID.8711; Aug. 2020 Modification Order, ¶ 6, ECF No. 217, PageID.10413.  Leaving door \nhangers  with  information  about  the  City’s  restoration  efforts  is  in  keeping  with  those \ncommitments.   \n   When enforcing a settlement agreement, as with a contract, the first objective is to “honor \nthe intent of the parties.”  Rasheed v. Chrysler Corp., 445 Mich. 109, 127 n.28, 517 N.W.2d 19, \n29 n.28 (1994).  The City intended to restore every property it excavated per the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement.  The plaintiffs’ requested notice remedy appears reasonably tailored to \naddress the City’s failure to honor that intention — and, perhaps, its efforts to avoid doing so.   \nIII. \n  The  parties’  stipulation  filed  in  response  to  this  fifth  enforcement  motion  outlines \nappropriate procedures to bring current the City’s responsibilities.  The plaintiffs also have \ndemonstrated that they are entitled to the relief they request to enforce the terms of this Settlement \nAgreement that is so important to the welfare of the City’s residents, and which promotes the \ninterests of the City and the State of Michigan in restoring confidence in the municipal water \nsystem.   \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ fifth motion to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement (ECF No. 242) is GRANTED.     \n-12- \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 258, PageID.11684   Filed 02/24/23   Page 13 of 26\n  It is further ORDERED that the City of Flint shall complete excavations and replace \nservice lines made of lead or galvanized steel (excluding restoration) at all 31,578 replacement \neligible homes appearing on the “2022 Replacement Eligible Homes List,” which has been agreed \nto and exchanged among the Settling Parties, as quickly as practicable and by no later than August \n1, 2023.  \n  It is further ORDERED that, for addresses where the City has scheduled an excavation or \nreplacement, the day before each scheduled excavation or replacement, the City shall make a \ntelephone call to the resident at whose address an excavation is scheduled if the City has a contact \nphone number for the household.

Presently before the Court is the\nplaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction through which they ask the Court to order the\ndefendants to provide two forms of immediate relief: First, the plaintiffs want the defendants to\nsubmit to the Court for review and approval a plan to provide every household served by the Flint\nwater system with reliable access to safe drinking water, which would include door-to-door delivery,\nif needed.  Second, the plaintiffs want the defendants to ensure that Flint residents have easy access\nto adequate information about lead contamination in their drinking water, the safe and unsafe uses\nof unfiltered tap water, and contact information residents can use if they need additional water\ndelivered or filter installation or maintenance.  At the evidentiary hearing held on September 14,\n\n2016, the defendants produced testimony on the condition of the water delivered to homes in Flint\nthrough the water delivery system, the cost of providing door-to-door delivery of bottled water, and\nsteps taken by City and State officials to remediate the contaminated system.  The plaintiffs offered\nanecdotal evidence of the hardships endured by Flint residents caused by the contamination, the\nunreliability of the 211 telephone call-in service for water deliveries, and the defendants’ inability\nconsistently to deliver safe drinking water to the tap in the homes of Flint residents.  \nThe criteria for obtaining a preliminary injunction are well known and undisputed by the\nparties. The relevant factors are whether (1) the moving party has demonstrated a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) the moving party will suffer irreparable injury without the\ninjunction; (3) the preliminary injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the public\ninterest will be served if the injunction issues.  Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 818-19 (6th\nCir. 2012) (citing Certified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, LLC v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535,\n542 (6th Cir. 2007)).  Although these factors are to be balanced, the failure to show a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits is generally fatal.  Ibid.; see also Gonzales v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 225\nF.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2000).  The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and that burden is the same\nirrespective of whether the relief sought is mandatory or prohibitive. United Food & Commercial\nWorkers Union, Local 1099 v. Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Auth., 163 F.3d 341, 348 (6th\nCir.1998).  Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the issuance of preliminary\ninjunctions and temporary restraining orders when appropriate. It is appropriate here.\nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nTo demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, the plaintiffs must show that they can\nprove violations of certain federal regulations enacted under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C.\n-2-\n\n§§ 300f, et seq., and that the defendants — the Michigan treasurer and members of the Flint\nReceivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) (the State defendants), and the City of Flint and\nits city administrator (the Flint defendants) — are responsible for curing those violations and\nproviding safe drinking water to the City’s water customers, the residents of the City of Flint.  But\nat this stage of the proceeding, the plaintiffs need not prove their case “in full.”  Univ. of Texas v.\nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  They need only show “more than a mere possibility of\nsuccess.”  NE. Ohio Coal. for Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 591 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting\nCertified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir.\n2007)).  As the Sixth Circuit has explained, “it is ordinarily sufficient if the plaintiff has raised\nquestions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult, and doubtful as to make them a fair\nground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.”  Six Clinics Holding Corp., II v.\nCafcomp Sys., Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 402 (6th Cir. 1997) (citing In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d\n1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985)).  The plaintiffs have easily satisfied this standard.    \nThis case involves the contamination of Flint’s drinking water with minerals that are harmful\nto health.  The plaintiffs contend that the contamination comes from the way the defendants have\noperated Flint’s public water system.  \nTo begin, according to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), a “‘public water delivery\nsystem’ means a system for the provision to the public of water for human consumption through\npipes or other constructed conveyances.”  42 U.S.C. § 300f(4)(A).  Under the SDWA, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) has enacted regulations with which operators of public\nwater delivery systems must comply.  The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated (1) the\nSDWA’s requirement to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, 40 C.F.R. §§\n-3-\n\n141.81–.82; (2) the SDWA’s requirements for monitoring tap water for lead, 40 C.F.R. § 141.86;\n(3) the SDWA’s reporting requirements, 40 C.F.R. § 141.90; and (4) the SDWA’s notification\nrequirements, 40 C.F.R. § 141.85.  They contend that both the Flint and State defendants are\nresponsible for remediating those violations and curing the harm caused.  The SDWA allows a\ncitizen-suit against any person “alleged to be in violation of any requirement prescribed” by the Act. \n42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)(1).  \nA.  SDWA Regulations\nThe City of Flint has operated a public water system for over a century.  See “Flint’s Water\nCrisis  Should  Raise  Alarms  for  America’s  Aging  Cities,”  Fortune  (found  at \nhttp://fortune.com/2016/01/25/flint-water-crisis-america-aging-cities-lead-pipes/) (last visited Nov.\n10, 2016) (noting that “[t]he city of Flint was incorporated in 1855, just as water mains were\nbecoming increasingly common in American cities”); How the Flint River Got So Toxic, The Verge\n(found at (http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-\nhistory) (last visited Nov. 10, 2016) (stating that “[b]etween 1900 and 1930, Flint had its first boom,\nreaching a population of 150,000. The city had been drawing its drinking and industrial water from\nthe Flint River since 1893. . .”).  Since 1965, the City of Detroit provided treated or “finished” water\nto Flint.  The finished water included chemicals, such as orthophosphate, to maintain corrosion\ncontrol and mitigate the leaching of lead into the water system from lead water pipes.  After a series\nof decisions discussed more fully below, Flint switched its water source from the Detroit system to\nthe Flint River in April 2014.  That change triggered requirements established by the SDWA\nregulations relating to treatment and monitoring drinking water in Flint’s delivery system.   \n-4-\n\n1. Corrosion Control\nThe SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300f, et seq., requires the EPA “to establish maximum contaminant\nlevel goals (MCLGs) and national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) for contaminants\nthat, in the judgment of the Administrator, may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and\nthat are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems.”  Maximum Contaminant Level\nGoals and National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper, 56 Fed. Reg.\n26460-01 (June 7, 1991).  In 1991, the EPA promulgated the Lead and Copper Rule with the goal\nof “provid[ing] maximum human health protection by reducing the lead and copper levels at\nconsumers’ taps to as close to the MCLG as is feasible.”  Ibid.  MCLGs are non-enforceable health\ngoals, whereas maximum containment levels (MCLs) are enforceable and should be set as close to\nthe relevant MCLG as possible.  Ibid.  The EPA’s MCLG for lead is zero.  Ibid.  The current MCL\nfor lead is 15 parts per billion (ppb), at the 90th percentile of samples collected in accordance with\n40 C.F.R. § 141.86.  40 C.F.R. § 141.80(c)(1).  \nThe EPA has determined that lead can enter drinking water systems from two sources: (1)\nfrom “raw water supplies, i.e., source water or distributed water, and (2) corrosion of plumbing\nmaterials in the water distribution system (corrosion by-products).  Most lead contamination is from\ncorrosion by-products.”  56 Fed. Reg. 26460-01.  “The amount of lead in drinking water attributable\nto corrosion by-products depends on a number of factors, including the amount and age of lead and\ncopper bearing materials susceptible to corrosion, how long the water is in contact with the lead\ncontaining surfaces, and how corrosive the water in the system is toward these materials.”  Ibid. \n“The amount of lead in drinking water depends heavily on the corrosivity of the water.”  Ibid. \n-5-\n\nAll water systems are required to “install and operate optimal corrosion control treatment.” \n40 C.F.R. § 141.80(d)(1).  “Optimal corrosion control treatment . . . means the corrosion control\ntreatment that minimizes the lead and copper concentrations at users’ taps while insuring that the\ntreatment  does  not  cause  the  water  system  to  violate  any  national  primary  drinking  water\nregulations.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  “All systems optimizing corrosion control shall continue to operate\nand maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, including maintaining water quality parameters\nat or above minimum values or within ranges designated by the State.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.82(g).  \nIn the 1990s, after a multi-year lead and copper corrosion control optimization study that\nincluded Flint, the Detroit water system administrators concluded that adding orthophosphate to\ndrinking water was the optimal treatment alternative for full-scale lead corrosion control in its water\nsystem.  According to Daniel Giammar, Ph.D, an environmental engineer with an expertise in water\nchemistry and its effect on drinking water distribution systems, adding orthophosphate to drinking\nwater can promote the formation of a lead-phosphate “scale” on the surface of lead pipes.  Giammar\nDecl. ¶ 19.  In order to maintain optimal levels of corrosion control once a stable protective scale\nhas formed inside of lead pipes, water systems must maintain the stability of the scale by continuing\nto add orthophosphate to the water.  Id. ¶ 21.\nAll parties acknowledge that Flint’s water system includes lead pipes.  In Mr. Giammar’s\nopinion, the constant flow of orthophosphate-treated water from Detroit created a chemically and\nphysically stable lead-phosphate scale on the interior surface of Flint’s lead pipes.  Id. ¶ 24.  He\nrepresents that a review of the Flint water system’s tap monitoring system shows more than a decade\nof lead concentrations ranging from 4 ppb to less than 2 ppb.  Id. ¶ 25.  But the Flint water\nadministrator failed to add orthophosphate to the Flint River water used after April 2014.  That\n-6-\n\nfailure, according to Mr. Giammar, caused significant damage to the lead-phosphate scale that built\nup over many years.  Id. ¶¶ 28-29.  This conclusion is supported by the water samples collected from\nJuly 2014 to December 2014, and January 2015 to June 2015, where the lead levels increased to 6\nppb and 11 ppb respectively.  Id. ¶ 34.  An additional set of water samples collected during August\n2015 saw an increase of lead levels to more than 25 ppb.  Id. ¶ 34.  \nFrom subsequent water monitoring data collected by the EPA and the Michigan Department\nof Environmental Quality (MDEQ), Mr. Giammar calculated lead levels ranging between 8 to 11\nppb, and between 0.9% and 1.6% of homes had lead levels above 100 ppb.  Id. ¶ 43.  He noted,\nhowever, that those samples may be biased low because the samples may not have been collected\nfrom homes with lead service lines, as is required by the SDWA.  Id. ¶ 46; see 40 C.F.R. §\n141.86(a)(8).  A new protective scale can take up to twelve months to form, but Mr. Giammar’s\nconclusion is that the subsequent data do not show a downward trend in the 90th percentile lead\nlevels as would be expected if the protective scale were reforming.  ¶¶ 36-44.\nMr. Giammar also reviewed publically available tap water monitoring data at sites that the\nMDEQ has designated as “sentinel sites.”  Id. ¶ 48.  Sentinel sites are homes in Flint that the MDEQ\nplans to sample repeatedly over time to determine the effectiveness of Flint’s water system corrosion\ncontrol.  Those samples showed a lead level of 14 ppb, and 2.1% of the samples showed lead\nconcentration levels of over 100 ppb.  Id. ¶ 49.  It was too early to make any conclusions from the\nsentinel site data at the time the preliminary injunction motion was filed, because the samples were\nonly collected during the course of a single month.  Id. ¶ 49.  And Bryce Feighner, Chief of the\nOffice of Drinking Water at the MDEQ, testified at the hearing that during the first six-month testing\nperiod, the initial lead levels were at 40 ppb, but reduced to 16 ppb by the last round of monitoring. \n-7-\n\nMr. Feighner agrees that the action level of 15 ppb was exceeded during that first six-month\nmonitoring period.  Most telling, however, was Mr. Feighner’s testimony that the unfiltered tap\nwater in Flint is not safe for the residents to drink at this time. \nIt appears beyond dispute that the City of Flint failed to meet its responsibilities under the\ncorrosion control regulations of the Lead and Copper Rule.\n2.  Monitoring\nThe change in Flint’s water source from the Detroit water system to the Flint River in April\n2014 triggered the requirement for Flint to renew its testing protocols, as prescribed by the MDEQ\nrules.  See Mich. Admin. R. §§ 325.10101-.12820.  The plaintiffs also argue that the defendants did\nnot comply with the Lead and Copper Rule’s monitoring requirements, and that the defendants\ncontinue to ignore the monitoring requirements.  Again, the defendants do not contest this argument.\nThe Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems personnel to conduct periodic tap water\nsampling for lead.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(d).  Beginning in 1992, Flint was required to complete a\nmaterials evaluation of its distribution system “in order to identify a pool of targeted sampling sites,\n. . . which [wa]s sufficiently large to ensure that the water system can collect the number of lead and\ncopper tap samples required” by the rule.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(a)(1).  Flint was required to use the\ninformation  collected  under  40  C.F.R.  §  141.42(d)  (special  monitoring  for  corrosivity\ncharacteristics) when conducting a materials evaluation.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(a)(2). \nThe regulations require that once the sampling site pool is established, “[a] water system\nshall collect each first draw tap sample from the same sampling site from which it collected a\nprevious sample.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(b)(4).  “If, for any reason, the water system cannot gain entry\nto a sampling site in order to collect a follow-up tap sample, the system may collect the follow-up\n-8-\n\ntap sample from another sampling site in its sampling pool as long as the new site meets the same\ntargeting criteria, and is within reasonable proximity of the original site.”  Ibid.  A first-draw sample\nis one liter of cold water that has stood motionless in the system for at least six hours taken from\neither the kitchen or bathroom sink tap.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(b)(2). \nPersonnel operating large water systems, such as Flint’s, must draw samples from 60 to 100\nsingle family structures designated as “tier 1 sampling sites,” that contain copper pipes with lead\nsolder installed after 1982, or lead pipes, or are served by a lead service line.  40 C.F.R. §\n141.86(a)(3) & (c).  Because Flint’s water system contains lead service lines, 50 percent of the\nsamples collected during each monitoring period must be from sites that include copper pipes with\nlead solder or lead pipes, and 50 percent from sites that are served by lead service lines.  40 C.F.R.\n§ 141.86(a)(8).  First-draw samples from residences may be collected by the water system, or by\nresidents after being instructed on the methods for collection.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(b)(2).  First-draw\nsamples from the service lines are conducted in much the same way, except that the samples must\nbe taken directly from the service line or after flushing the water in a residence long enough to\naccess the water that was in the lead service line (either by calculating the water volume or waiting\nfor a significant change in temperature of the water).  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(b)(3).  \nThe regulations require Flint to sample its water system every six months until the water\nsystem achieves lead levels at or below 15 ppb for two consecutive six-month monitoring periods,\nat which point it is allowed to reduce its sampling sites and test only once per year.  40 C.F.R. §\n141.86(d)(4) & (c).  Any system that demonstrates a tap water lead level at or below 5 ppb, and\ncopper levels at or below 6.5 ppb, may further reduce the frequency of sampling to once every three\ncalendar years.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(v).  \n-9-\n\nAfter Flint switched to the Flint River as a water source, the MDEQ required the collection\nof tap water samples for two six-month monitoring periods.  Mich. Admin. R. § 325.10710(a)(3). \nHowever, Flint did not comply with all the Lead and Copper Rule monitoring requirements.  It\nappears that there had been 324 monitoring sites used by the Flint water system for compliance from\n1992 to 2015.  Rather than taking samples from the targeted sampling sites, Flint reached out to the\ngeneral public, its own employees, and even entertained posting requests for testing sites on Twitter. \nIndeed, the Flint Utilities Manager said in an interview that the water system “throw[s] bottles out\neverywhere” to collect the required number of samples.  Pl.’s Mot., Ex. 60 at 5.  It appears that only\n14 of the 100 homes used in the previous six-month period were used for the 2015 period, which is\na clear violation of the Lead and Copper Rule.  See Pl.’s Mot., Ex. 61, Pls.’ App’x pp. 366-68. \nAdditionally, five days before the end of the 2015 monitoring period, the MDEQ informed\nFlint that it needed 61 more water samples, and that based on the first 39 samples, the water system\nmeasured over the 15-ppb action level.  During this period, it appears that the Flint population was\nunder 100,000 (99,763), and therefore only required 60 tap samples.  Mich. Admin. R. §§\n325.10710a(3).  Nonetheless, the tap samples provided from June 25, 2015 to June 30, 2015 were\nnot from the pre-established sampling pool, and all of the samples had lead levels below 15 ppb. \nOn November 9, 2015, the MDEQ sent a letter to the Flint Water System seeking additional\ninformation about its compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule.  The letter stated that all of the\nLead and Copper reports submitted to the MDEQ certified that all of the tap samples were collected\nfrom tier 1 sites.  However, the MDEQ stated that it could not confirm that the 324 historically used\ntier 1 sites indeed were qualifying sites.  For example, it could only confirm that 6 of the sites\ncontained lead service lines, and 26 of the sites used service lines that were not lead.  Indeed, the\n-10-\n\nMDEQ stated that there are more than 10,000 homes and businesses in Flint with service lines of\nunknown composition.  \nIt appears that Flint is continuing to violate the monitoring requirements.  The Flint water\nsystem was required to continue water sampling for the monitoring period of January 1, 2016 to June\n30, 2016.  According to the plaintiffs, based on the available data, the sentinel site monitoring does\nnot consist entirely of homes that meet the Lead and Copper Rule requirements, in part, because it\nrelies on citizen volunteers to provide water samples.  Furthermore, the EPA noted that Flint has not\n“demonstrated that it has an adequate number of qualified personnel to perform the duties and\nobligations required to ensure the City’s public water system complies with the [SDWA] and the\n[NPDWRs], including the [Lead and Copper Rule].”  Pl.’s Mot., Ex. 70, Pls.’ App’x p. 416.  \nThe defendants have not offered contrary evidence.  It appears, therefore, that there is no\ndispute that monitoring requirements were not followed and continue to be disregarded.  \n3.  Defendants’ Response\nThe  parties  have  not  discussed  the  claimed  violations  of  the  SDWA’s  reporting  or\nnotification requirements in this injunction proceeding, and the Court need not address them.  The\nFlint defendants argue, however, that the plaintiffs cannot carry their burden of demonstrating a\nlikelihood of success on the merits because the relief they seek is moot in light of the pending, now\nimplemented, water delivery plan.  The Flint defendants argue that they should be given the benefit\nof the doubt that the plan will be in place and run effectively.  That argument talks past the claimed\ncorrosion control and monitoring requirements, however.  It more appropriately is considered as a\nresponse to the contention that irreparable harm cannot be shown, and the Court will discuss it when\nassessing that factor.\n-11-\n\nB.  Defendants’ Responsibility \nThere is no question that the Flint defendants bear some responsibility for addressing the\ncontamination problem.  The State defendants argue that the relief sought is overbroad, and that an\ninjunction should not issue because the State defendants are not “operators” within the meaning of\nthe SDWA.  That argument is not persuasive.  Because of the State defendants’ initial and\ncontinuing involvement in decisions that affect water delivery, they also are properly subject to this\ninjunction.\nIt is undisputed that over the last several years, Flint has experienced economic challenges,\nand in 2011 the City was placed in receivership.  That year, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder\nappointed Michael Brown as the emergency manager to run the City of Flint under the Local\nGovernment and School District Fiscal Accounting Act, Public Act 4 of 2011 (Public Act 4) (later\nrejected by Proposition 12-1, effective August 8, 2012).  The emergency manager “act[ed] for and\nin the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief administrative officer of the local\ngovernment.”  Public Act 4, § 15(4).  The emergency manager displaced Flint’s locally elected\ngovernment while the receivership was in effect.  Public Act 4, § 15(4) (“Upon the declaration of\nreceivership  and  during  the  pendency  of  receivership,  the  governing  body  and  the  chief\nadministrative officer of the local government may not exercise any of the powers of those offices\nexcept as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager and are subject to any\nconditions required by the emergency manager.”).  Instead, the State, through its emergency\nmanager, was responsible to “assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and the local\ngovernment’s capacity to provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential\nto the public health, safety, and welfare.”  Ibid.  \n-12-\n\nMichael Brown was succeeded by three more emergency managers — Edward Kurtz,\nDarnell Early, and Gerald Ambrose — although they were appointed under subsequent versions of\nPublic Act 4.  As a group, the emergency managers took major steps toward rectifying Flint’s\nfinancial emergency.  Those steps included the purchase of water from the Karegondi Water\nAuthority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.  On March 25, 2013, Flint’s City\nCouncil, while under receivership, voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a\nconsortium of cities and counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline\nthat will provide water from Lake Huron to Flint and the surrounding areas.  The shift away from\nDetroit water was a purported cost-saving decision that was projected to have substantial savings\nover the next 25 years.  The decision  required the approval of then emergency manager Gerald\nAmbrose.  On April 17, 2013, Flint gave notice to Detroit that it would be terminating its contract\nand no longer purchasing water from Detroit beginning on April 17, 2014.  The termination of the\ncontract, however, occurred before the KWA pipeline was in place.  Although Detroit offered to\ncontinue to provide water to Flint at a discounted rate while the KWA finished its pipeline, Flint\ndeclined the offer.  In the interim, the City Council and emergency manager decided to activate\nFlint’s own water treatment plant and use the Flint River as its water source.    \nWhen Flint began using the Flint River water in April of 2014, it did not treat the water with\northophosphate to control lead levels in the drinking water, and instead added chemicals, such as\nferric chloride, which, studies have shown, exacerbate the problem.  In the months following the\nswitch to the Flint River, residents reported that their water was discolored, foul-smelling, and laden\nwith sediment.  Subsequent testing showed a substantial increase of lead in the Flint drinking water. \n-13-\n\nIn April 2015, after being informed that the financial emergency had been addressed, the\ngovernor appointed the City of Flint RTAB to succeed the emergency managers under the Local\nFinancial Stability and Choice Act 436 of 2012, 141.1563.  Emergency Manager Gerald Ambrose\nissued Order No. 20, which effectuated the transfer of governing power to the RTAB.  That order\ncontains at least two provisions that are relevant here: first, it requires that the City’s governing\nauthority “[t]ake all steps necessary to successfully establish, develop, and complete the Karegnondi\nWater Authority (KWA) project”; and second, those city officials “shall not revise any Order that\nwas implemented by the Emergency Manager during his or her term prior to one year after the\ntermination of the receivership.”\nAs the Court held in its opinion denying the motion to dismiss, the state defendants qualify\nas operators of the Flint water system.  The term “operator” is not defined in the SDWA.  But that\nterm is found in other environmental statutes, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).  Under CERCLA, “operator” is defined as\n“any person owning or operating” a facility.  42 U.S.C. § 9601(20)(A)(ii).  The Supreme Court gave\nthe term in CERCLA its “ordinary meaning” as “someone who directs the workings of, manages,\nor conducts the affairs of a facility.”  United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 66 (1998).  The Court\nrecognized that “operate” means “more than mere mechanical activation of pumps and valves, and\nmust be read to contemplate ‘operation’ as including the exercise of direction over the facility’s\nactivities.”  Id. at 71.\nThe Court previously found that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to establish\nthat the state defendants were operators of the Flint water system within the meaning of the SDWA,\nand the plaintiffs have tendered further evidence to support that finding.  For instance, the state\n-14-\n\ndefendants routinely assessed whether plant operators were qualified, evaluated the water system’s\nwater-source options, and gathered information about chemicals and equipment needed for water\ntreatment.  Indeed, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, commissioned by the governor, issued a\nreport stating that\n[t]he role of the emergency manager (EM) under the Emergency Manager law, PA\n436, is clear and unambiguous.  Though they report directly to the Department of\nTreasury, EMs have complete authority and control over municipal decisions.  In that\ncontext, the EMs had the responsibility to ensure that Flint water system operations\nwere adequately resourced and supported by personnel and consultants with adequate\ntraining and expertise.\n. . . \nNumerous decisions were made between December 2011 and April 2015 that had\nsome impact on the decision to use the Flint River as the primary source of drinking\nwater  for  the  city  of  Flint.    Various state-appointed EMs served during this\ntimeframe and it was these EMs who made these decisions, not locally elected\nofficials.  Although  it  is  true  that  some  locally  elected  officials  supported,\nacknowledged, embraced, and even celebrated some of the decisions, the decisions\nwere not theirs to make.  The state-appointed EMs made the decisions.\nPl.’s Mot., Ex. S, Pls.’ App’x pp. 669-70; see also Pls.’ App’x pp. 678-80 (Letter by Gerald\nAmbrose explaining the state of affairs of the water system as of March 3, 2015, which demonstrates\nhis involvement with Flint’s water system).\nFor the last few years, Treasury officials have participated in near-weekly meetings with\nFlint officials during which they discussed various aspects of the water system, including water-\nquality sampling, boil-water notices, environmental compliance, and preparation to switch to a new\nwater source.  Moreover, the water system cannot purchase treatment chemicals or implement a\nproject plan for water system improvements absent RTAB’s approval. \nThe state defendants argue that the City of Flint is the sole owner and operator of its water\nsystem.  However, for all practical purposes, the state defendants have been the municipal\ngovernment during the receivership that was put into place by Governor Snyder.  The emergency\n-15-\n\nmanagers “act[ed] for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief\nadministrative officer of the local government.”  Public Act 4, § 15(4).  They had “broad powers .\n. . to assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and the local government’s capacity\nto provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to the public health,\nsafety, and welfare.”  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Indeed, “the governing body and the chief\nadministrative officer of the local government [could] not exercise any of the powers of those offices\nexcept as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager and are subject to any\nconditions required by the emergency manager.”  Ibid.  The RTAB is the next representative of the\nState and is required to follow the emergency managers’ established orders.  And any decisions to\nremediate the continuing crisis must be made and approved by that board.  There is substantial\nevidence that the state defendants have significant involvement with compliance going forward; it\nis their actions that are the focal point in this case.\nThe plaintiffs have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. \nAccordingly, this factor weighs heavily in the plaintiffs’ favor.\nII.  Irreparable Harm\nIt is beyond dispute that Flint residents, like all other people, need daily access to a source\nof safe drinking water, and the presence of lead in drinking water can cause serious health problems. \nMost at risk to lead exposure are infants, young children, and pregnant women.  Lead can cause\npermanent damage to the brain and kidneys and can interfere with the production of oxygen-carrying\nred blood cells that perfuse other organs.  Lead poisoning has been linked with lowered mental\nfunctioning in children.  And it can affect more severely adults with kidney ailments and high blood\npressure.  That much is uncontested here.  \n-16-\n\nThe Flint defendants argue, however, that the plaintiffs have not offered evidence that a\nsingle Flint water user lacks access to safe drinking water, nor that a single consumer has been\nforced to consume unsafe water.  They characterize the harm claimed by the plaintiffs in three ways:\n(1) inconvenient for some; (2) embarrassing for some; and (3) and embarrassing for some because\ntheir needs are being met by people or organizations other than the government.\nThe Flint defendants contend that although some Flint residents suffer varying degrees of\ninconvenience and embarrassment in obtaining safe drinking water, such inconveniences do not rise\nto the level of an irreparable harm.  They believe that Gilley v. United States, 649 F.2d 449, 455 (6th\nCir. 1981), supports their position.  It does not. The Gilley court based its decision primarily on\nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that neither financial\nloss nor damage to reputation constitutes irreparable harm sufficient to support a preliminary\ninjunction in the context of a probationary federal employee seeking to prevent her discharge.   415\nU.S. at 91-92.  That holding was extended by the Sixth Circuit in Gilley, when the court held that\nharm to a tenured federal employee’s reputation was not sufficiently irreparable to support a\npreliminary injunction to bar transfer of the employee to another work site.  649 F.2d at 454.  Gilley\nis readily distinguishable from the present case on its facts, and it applies a legal standard that is\nunique to federal labor disputes.  See ibid. (holding that the “standards for judging claims of\nirreparable harm in federal personnel cases . . . are more stringent than those applicable to other\nclasses of cases.”  Ibid.   It does not provide guidance on the irreparable harm determination in this\ncase.\nThe state defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not shown irreparable harm because they\nare not in danger of consuming tainted Flint water, since clean water is available for free to all those\n-17-\n\nwho need it.  They also contend that the plaintiffs’ delay in filing this motion for preliminary\ninjunction nullifies any showing of irreparable harm; and the plaintiffs delayed providing to the State\nthe addresses of particular individuals in need, such as Jacqueline Childress (who testified about her\ntravails at the evidentiary hearing), and therefore caused the delay in getting them the relief they\nneeded. \nThe state defendants rely mistakenly on Fund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982 (D.C.\nCir. 1975), for the proposition that a plaintiff’s delay somehow nullifies irreparable harm.  But that\ncase dealt with a request for a preliminary injunction to stop a regulation issued by the Fish and\nWildlife Service that permitted hunting the greater snow goose.  Id. at 984.  The D.C. Circuit\nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that irreparable harm could be established by proof that a small loss\nof a reasonably abundant species would irretrievably damage the species.  Id. at 987.  In addition,\nthe panel mentioned in passing that the plaintiffs’ delay in seeking injunctive relief  “bolstered” the\n“conclusion that an injunction should not issue.”  Ibid. \nThe delay in seeking injunctive relief in this case in no way resembles the circumstances in\nFund for Animals.   Here, once the state officials acknowledged the lead contamination in Flint’s\nwater system, the emergency response to the crisis changed rapidly in the early months as the\nresponse teams and volunteers endeavored to meet Flint’s drinking water needs.  Once the State’s\nefforts took shape and became more stable, the plaintiffs took the prudent step of requesting limited\ndiscovery to ensure the relief they sought was still needed.  When it was clear to them that the efforts\nwere insufficient, they proceeded with their motion.  Arguing that irreparable harm is “nullified” by\nthe plaintiffs’ own delay is unfounded.  Any delay caused by lack of contact information for specific\n-18-\n\npersons in need is largely irrelevant to the overall question of irreparable harm caused by the\nquestionable availability of safe drinking water to Flint residents.  \nIt is abundantly clear that the public relies every day on the ready availability of safe\ndrinking water at the tap.  The most efficient and cost effective way to deliver safe drinking water\nto a population is through a public water system. The SDWA was enacted in 1974 “to assure that\nwater supply systems serving the public meet minimum national standards for protection of public\nhealth.”  1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454, 6454. \nA safe water supply has always been critical to civilization.  Early villages were purposely\nlocated near good water supplies, and ancient trails were often routed past natural springs.  In the\n1600s and 1700s, water systems were localized and consisted generally of little more than a water\nsupply source.  Communities came to rely on central wells or ponds for filling buckets and carrying\nthe water home on a daily basis. \nDuring the 1800s, America fundamentally changed from an agrarian society to an urban\nindustrial society.  A “few modern citywide [water] systems began to appear before 1830.  By the\nlate nineteenth century, waterworks were generally regarded as a public enterprise, justified as such\nbecause of the need to protect the public health and to supply water on a citywide basis.”  Martin\nV. Melosi, PhD, The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America From Colonial Times to the\nPresent, 423 (2000).  “The new distribution system of pipes and pumps removed from the individual\nresponsibility for filling containers at a public well or local watercourse, and made the waterworks\n. . . responsible for bringing water directly to each consumer.  Implicit in this system was a guarantee\nthat the supply met the prevailing standards of purity.” Id. at 424. \n-19-\n\nIn modern society, when we turn on a faucet, we expect safe drinking water to flow out.  As\nthe evidence shows, that is no longer the case in Flint.  The Flint water crisis has in effect turned\nback the clock to a time when people traveled to central water sources to fill their buckets and carry\nthe water home.\nAlthough the evidence from the hearing established that Flint’s tap water is not safe to drink,\nthe defendants maintain that injunctive relief is not necessary because Flint residents can obtain all\nthe water they need for drinking from bottles available at points of distribution (PODs) throughout\nthe city, and tap water run through a filter contains only small amounts of lead, which measures\nbelow the EPA’s action level prescribed by the SDWA’s regulations.  They rely on Lyda v. City of\nDetroit (In re City of Detroit, Mich.), No. 13-53846, 2014 WL 6474081 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. Nov.\n19, 2014), as authority for the idea that community water distribution efforts negate a finding of\nirreparable harm.  In that case, the plaintiffs sought, among other things, to enjoin the City of Detroit\nfrom shutting off their water due to unpaid water bills.  Id. at *1.  The court assessed the preliminary\ninjunction factors, even though it questioned its authority to grant such relief.  Id. at *13.  The court\nconcluded that an injunction would not be warranted because there was very little likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, even though there was strong evidence of irreparable harm.  Ibid.  The court\ngave two reasons for rejecting the defendants argument that the availability of bottled water\nameliorated the irreparable harm caused by water shut-offs: first, bottled water was more expensive,\nand second the court noted “it is challenging to commit the time and energy necessary to purchase\nand transport sufficient quantities of water.” Id. at *12.  Although the Flint defendants argue that the\nLyda court denied injunctive relief, in part, because of the patchwork of charity and public funds\navailable to the plaintiffs to assist with obtaining water, the case plainly does not stand for that\n-20-\n\nproposition.  See Lyda, 2014 WL 6474081, at *11 (stating that “there ha[d] been no analysis of\nwhether the available resources w[ould] be sufficient to address [the plaintiffs’] need[s] over the\nlong term”).  Moreover, the plaintiffs have offered evidence that rebuts the defendants’ assumptions\nthat the distribution of water filters and bottled water addresses the obvious daily need for safe\ndrinking water.  \nThe filtered water solution is a commendable step, but it is uneven at best.  MDEQ Chief\nBryce Feighner testified that filtered water is safe for everyone to drink, including young children\nand pregnant women.  But he also acknowledged and agreed with a Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC) study that found that certain Pur and Brita filters make the Flint tap water safe to drink only\nwhen the filters are properly installed and maintained. \nChristopher Kelenske, a Captain with the Michigan State Police who commands the\nEmergency Management Homeland Security Division, assumed control of the emergency response\nin Flint in January 2016, and presently manages the State’s response to the Flint water crisis and\ncoordinates the distribution of resources in Flint.  He testified that between 30,000 and 34,000\nhomes rely on the Flint water system.  He confirmed that water filters and cartridges are available\nto Flint residents at several PODs throughout the city.  The water filters were confirmed by the\nNational Sanitation Foundation to reduce lead in drinking water. According to Captain Kelenske,\nas of April 11, 2016, all of the active water customer households had been visited by water response\nteams.  Of those homes, 90% confirmed having water filters.  The remaining 10% of homes have\nbeen visited, but response teams have been unable to make contact to confirm the residents have the\nwater filters.  Additionally, 89.1% of the 5,686 apartments in Flint have been visited and 99.7% of\nthose visited confirmed having water filters.  As of April 11, 2016, more than 100,000 certified\n-21-\n\nwater filters, 240,000 water filter cartridges, and 44,000 water testing kits had been distributed.  He\nalso testified that the MDEQ recently began a program called Community Outreach and Resident\nEducation (CORE), which sends out teams to install water filters and educate residents about the\nwater crisis.  In August 2016, CORE personnel began training Flint residents to take over the\nprogram.  There are currently two teams in operation and they have visited approximately 1,100\nhomes and installed approximately 400 water filters.  \nNonetheless, distributing water filters alone does not guarantee that they are properly\ninstalled and maintained.  For instance, Michael Hood, the executive director of Crossing Water, a\nnon-profit corporation started in January 2016 to respond to the Flint water crisis, testified that his\norganization delivers bottled water and water filters to Flint residents using rapid response service\nteams (RRSTs), and also installs water filters and installs new plumbing when necessary to allow\nfor the installation of water filters.  Crossing Water has visited more than 400 homes and interacted\nwith approximately 800 families in Flint.  According to Mr. Hood, the installation process is not as\nsimple as one might imagine.  Damage to the faucet and pipes, which he often finds, prevents proper\ninstallation.  Aerators must be removed from the faucet head and cleaned, which can be difficult if\nthe aerator has corroded onto the faucet or the resident does not have the dexterity to remove it. \nAfter the aerator is reattached, the appropriate adaptor and washer that comes with the water filter\nmust be attached to the faucet.  However, sometimes the adaptors do not fit a given faucet.  If the\nfilter is attached, a filter cartridge must then be placed inside that water filter and cold water only\nmust be run through the filter to make sure it is working.  \nMr. Hood testified that some residents can install the filters easily, but others have difficulty\nfor a variety of reasons: some are illiterate or do not read English and therefore cannot read the\n-22-\n\ninstructions; others have cognitive issues, are elderly, or lack the tools necessary for the installation;\nand still others have faucets that simply are not compatible with any of the filters. \nMoreover, once a water filter is installed, it is important to maintain it by periodically\nreplacing the cartridge.  The filters have lights that indicate when the cartridge is expired or about\nto expire.  But it is also important to run only cold water through the filters, because hot water can\ncompromise the cartridge.  Mr. Hood testified that some residents have been given the wrong\ncartridge replacements, are running hot water through the filters, and in one case a resident was\nusing the filter without a cartridge, rendering it entirely ineffective.  Mr. Hood testified that the data\nthat have been collected by Crossing Water indicates that as many as 52% of the homes visited by\nCrossing Water had some type of problem with the water filters.  Although on cross-examination,\nthe city defendants challenged Crossing Water’s computation and suggested that the actual number\nsupported by the data was closer to 23%, even that number indicates that the distribution of water\nfilters does not ameliorate the danger of lead contamination to a large swath of Flint water\ncustomers.  \nCynthia Roper, the director of Michigan Voice, an advocacy group, testified that she has \nwitnessed confusion about maintaining water filters.  For example, in July she spoke with a woman\nwho had her 15-year-old son install the water filter, but the resident was not sure it was installed\nproperly.  When asked how long it had been since she had replaced the filter, the woman reported\nfive months, which far exceeds its effective life.  Ms. Roper also mentioned that the woman ran hot\nwater through the filter, which compromises the filter.  \nThe installation and proper maintenance of water filters that allow delivery of tap water with\nlead contents below the Lead and Copper Rule’s action level might be an acceptable response that\n-23-\n\nblunts the plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable harm.  But the defendants have not offered sufficient\nevidence that the water filter solution is an effective one, because there is no reliable data\nestablishing that the filters are properly installed and consistently maintained.  \nThat leads to the question whether the defendants’ efforts to furnish bottled water adequately\nalleviates the harm they caused with lead contamination.  Certainly, since the Flint water system\ncannot deliver safe drinking water to the homes of Flint residents through its water main and service\nline distribution system, then alternate container delivery — bottled water — becomes necessary. \nThe defendants insist that they have satisfied that obligation, and indeed, significant efforts to\ndistribute bottled water have been undertaken.  \nCaptain Kelenske testified in an affidavit that on January 6, 2016, the State Emergency\nOperations Center (SEOC) was activated and staffed daily from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m, and later\nthose times were extended to 8:00 p.m. seven days a week.  On January 8, 2016, Flint’s Mayor\ndedicated five Flint fire stations as points of distribution.  Additionally, nine Flint churches were\nsupplied with bottled water for distribution.  The fire stations were staffed by the American Red\nCross and remained open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  State agencies also have been working on\ntranslating written information to be distributed into multiple languages, including Spanish, Chinese-\nMandarin, Arabic, Hmoob-Hmong, and American Sign Language. \nBeginning on January 14, 2016, in addition to current water supplies, more than 12,000 cases\nof water began to arrive daily for distribution.  According to the Flint defendants, there is no limit\non the amount of water a resident may have, and residents are not required to produce identification\nto receive Commodities.  More points of distribution were set up and service announcements were\n-24-\n\nmade to inform Flint residents of their locations.  According to Captain Kelenske, as of April 11,\n2016, more than 8 million liters of water had been distributed. \nThe State continues to operate nine PODs, one in each of Flint’s nine wards.  The Flint\nTransit Authority is willing to make adjustments to bus routes to assist with water distribution, and\nwill provide free rides to the points of distribution if needed.  The United Way has provided bus\npasses for those who cannot afford them.  \nKelenske testified that his agency identified individuals in Flint who are homebound and\ncreated an Access and Functional Needs list (AFN list).   The initial AFN list was compiled by\ncontacting various agencies that serve, for example, the aging population.  As of date of the hearing,\na list of 1250 residents had been compiled; those residents receive weekly deliveries of water.  He\ncontends that the people on the list are visited by rapid response teams approximately every five to\nseven days.  Flint residents may also call either 211 or (866) 561-2500 if they need assistance\ninstalling water filters or require deliveries of water.  The requests made through the call numbers\nare sent to the emergency operations centers several times a day and delivery routes are scheduled. \nThe delivery teams are comprised of individuals from the American Red Cross and AmeriCorp\nNational Civilian Community Corps.  When the teams make contact with Flint residents, they\ndetermine whether the residents need to be added to the AFN List. \nThose efforts certainly are commendable.  However, the plaintiffs have offered credible\nanecdotal evidence that indicates that the distribution network is in flux and not completely effective\nin providing safe drinking water to several households.  \nFor instance, Loretta Burns, a 69-year-old long-time Flint resident, testified in an affidavit\nthat getting bottled water has become a major challenge.  She is the primary care giver for two of\n-25-\n\nher grandsons, and takes care of her husband, who has significant health problems.  Ms. Burns is\nthe only person in her household capable of obtaining cases of bottled water.  She says that shortly\nafter the water crisis was announced, her family received home deliveries of bottled water from\nvolunteers and community organizers.  After a month, however, those deliveries ceased.  Ms. Burns\nsays that it has been difficult to get information, and only learned that she was able to get water from\none of the fire stations because she happened to drive by it.  And when she did ask for water from\nthat location, she was limited to two cases, which forced her to stop at various churches advertising\nbottled water.  Furthermore, Ms. Burns says that the lines at the fire station were long, she had to\nsign her name, give her address, and show her driver’s license to receive the water.  When the fire\nstation stopped providing water, she drove around town looking for a new distribution center and\nasked neighbors where water could be found.  Because of the size of her family, Ms. Burns has to\npick up cases of water about three times a week, and she is never sure where water will be available,\nor how much she will be allowed to have.  Ms. Burns says that she has filters, but that she has\nreceived conflicting information about who should use the filters and how often the filters need to\nbe changed. \nJacqueline Childress, a 60-year-old retired General Motors inspector, testified at the hearing\nthat she has been a resident of Flint for most of her life.  She rents a house in Flint and lives with her\n40-year-old son who has a mental disability.  Ms. Childress relies on her pension and Social Security\nbenefits to support herself.  She does not drink the tap water in her home. Neither she nor her son\nown a vehicle; she must rely on others to drive her to pick up water from the various PODs. \nSometimes her other son gives her a ride, but other times she pays anywhere from $10 to $20 for\na ride to pick up the bottled water she uses for drinking.  When the water crisis first began, Ms.\n-26-\n\nChildress says that she often received deliveries of bottled water.  However, the water deliveries\nhave slowed down and now are not frequent.  She has called 211 several times, but has yet to receive\na bottled water delivery as a result of calling 211.  Ms. Childress testified that she has plates and\nscrews in her legs, which makes it more difficult to carry cases of bottled water.  She acknowledged\nthat there are sites where water can be obtained, but without a car she cannot retrieve the drinking\nwater.  She knows buses are available, but she is only able to carry one case of bottled water at a\ntime, which may only last her family half a day.  She said that she has run out of bottled water a\nnumber of times.  Ms. Childress testified that she has a water filter, but when it was installed the\nfaucet broke.  She said that she was unaware that the plumbers union had been replacing faucets at\nno cost.  Without a working faucet, she cannot use a water filter.  She said that for many people on\nher block it is a big struggle to get the bottled water they need.\nJerry Gains is a 67-year-old veteran who lives with his wife and daughter; all suffer from\nserious medical conditions.  Before the fire station near him stopped providing water, he was making\nthree trips a week to retrieve cases of water.  When he would go to the station, he could only get two\none-gallon jugs or two cases of water per visit, which was simply not enough to meet his\nhousehold’s needs.  He was forced to drive around the city searching for water to supplement the\nwater he received from the fire station.  Recently, after several changes in distribution centers, he\nhas been able to get as much water as he asks for.  Mr. Gains notes, however, because he is unable\nto walk up his front steps with a case of water, he has to toss the cases to the top of the stairs so his\ndaughter can pick them up.  He has to take breaks when unloading the water because he gets short\nof breath.  He only recently heard about the 211 number from a neighbor. \n-27-\n\nA filter was delivered to Mr. Gain’s home early in 2016, but it did not have installation\ninstructions.  He installed it and assumed it could remain in place until the indicator light turned red. \nHowever, after four months the indicator light did not change, and a canvasser subsequently told him\nthat he should be changing the filter at least once a month.  Therefore, he and his family do not trust\nthe filtered tap water. \nCommunity organizers contend that the experiences of Ms. Burns, Ms. Childress, and Mr.\nGains are not unique.  Mary Brady-Enerson testified in an affidavit that she has canvassed Flint\nsince January 31, 2016 and has encountered residents without access to safe drinking water, faucets\nthat cannot use filters, and those who are confused on how to properly install and monitor filters they\nhave.  She also contends that the new distribution centers do not open until noon and close most days\nby 6 p.m.   \nDarnell  Ishmel,  who  runs  FlintH2o,  a  community-led  digital  platform  that  seeks  to\ncoordinate water and resource access for Flint, has also witnessed Flint residents struggling to access\nwater.  He witnessed one man struggling to carry two cases of water on his back to his multi-\ngenerational family, as he does several times a week.  He recalls one instance when a semitrailer\ntruck from Maryland arrived during a snowstorm blared its horns and called out “Water!” to the\nFlint residents.  Despite being within a few blocks of one of the fire stations, residents from the\nsurrounding area came out in the snow to receive water from the truck. \nDespite the substantial efforts of Captain Kelenske and others, it is clear that some residents,\nwho are actively seeking safe drinking water, are encountering great difficulty in accessing safe\ndrinking water by retrieving bottled water from the PODs.  \n-28-\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has held that, “‘despite the overall flexibility of the test for preliminary\ninjunctive relief, and the discretion vested in the district court, equity has traditionally required a\nshowing of irreparable harm before an interlocutory injunction may be issued.’” Nat’l Viatical, Inc.\nv. Universal Settlements Int’l, Inc., 716 F.3d 952, 957 (6th Cir. 2013) (internal marks omitted)\n(quoting Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Mich. Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 103 (6th Cir. 1982)). \nPlaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must “demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the\nabsence of an injunction.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (emphasis\nin original) (citing cases).  “‘A preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to prevent the\npossibility of some remote future injury.’” Ibid. (quoting 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1, p. 139 (2d ed. 1995)).\nThe plaintiffs have satisfied this factor, even in the face of the defendants’ evidence of the\navailability of bottled water and filters.  The fact that such items are available does not mean that\nthey are reliably accessible or effective in furnishing safe drinking water to every household. \nBottled water is heavy, and not all of Flint’s residents are capable of transporting the cases of water\neffectively.  Indeed, the endeavor of hunting for water has become a dominant activity in some Flint\nresidents’ daily lives.  The initial surge of volunteer support last winter aided greatly in the\ndistribution efforts, but as that effort wanes, for any number of reasons, access to water becomes\nmore difficult.  Furthermore, leaving water filters at residents’ doorsteps — even if the instructions\nare provided in multiple languages — does not ensure proper installation and maintenance.  The\nlikelihood that some of the filters are installed improperly and Flint residents are continuing to\nconsume lead is quite high under the circumstances.\n-29-\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs have shown that the AFN list is inadequate and there are no clear\ncriteria for getting onto or being removed from the list.  The plaintiffs argue persuasively that in\nlight of the varied challenges facing Flint residents, the AFN list only addresses a small part of the\naccess problem.  The plaintiffs also point out that the 211 help line is not always effective.  As Ms.\nChildress testified, the 211 staff “are very nice when you call them, but they just don’t come.”  \nSome residents have stopped calling, and some, because illiteracy is common and internet access\nlimited, still do not know that 211 is available to take delivery requests.  \nThe plaintiffs have made a significant showing that at least some residents have struggled\nto obtain the water they need to sustain themselves.  And their evidence raises serious questions as\nto the efficacy of the emergency response.  Flint has been struggling to access safe drinking water\nfor the better part of a year.  With the colder months approaching, it is reasonable to conclude that\nthe difficulties will worsen.  This factor weighs in favor of the plaintiffs.\nIII.  Harm to Others\nThe Flint defendants maintain that injunctive relief in the form requested by the plaintiffs\n— particularly door-to-door water delivery to every home in the city — will cause them great\nfinancial harm, and it is speculative that the relief will be of any benefit. David Sabuda, Flint’s\nInterim Chief Financial Officer, testified that although Flint has a water fund that accounts for the\nwater revenues and the water expenses for the city, it has a projected negative cash flow of\napproximately $18.9 million between June of 2016 and June of 2017.  He also testified that although\nFlint is anticipating spending $12.9 million on water in the current fiscal year, those funds can be\nused only to purchase water, and the funds cannot be used to fund a door-to-door water delivery\nsystem for bottled water.  Sabuda said that if Flint were required to pay for a door-to-door bottled\n-30-\n\nwater delivery service, it would be $9 million a month, and such an expense would be devastating\nto the City of Flint. \nSimilarly, Captain Kelenske testified that his staff projected the cost of providing door-to-\ndoor delivery service of five cases of bottled water each week for every home in Flint to be\napproximately $9.4 million a month, which is $6 million more than his operation is spending now. \nAt 10 cases a week, the estimated cost would be $11.4 million a month.  Captain Kelenske expects\nit would take 70 teams to accomplish such deliveries and his recommendation would be to activate\nthe National Guard, although he offered no supporting information for either the amount of expense\nor the need for the National Guard call-up.\nAdded expenses of that magnitude, if shouldered solely by the City of Flint, indeed would\nbe daunting.  But, as noted above, the city still is under the governmental control of the State of\nMichigan through the governance of the RTAB.  The plaintiffs have furnished evidence that of the\n$212 million appropriated by the State to respond to the Flint water crisis, about $100 million\nremains unspent, and only about five percent of the total has been used to purchase bottled water and\nfilters.  \nThe defendants argue that the large cost of the proposed injunctive relief is not worth the\nbenefit, relying on Sierra Club, Inc. v. Bostick, 539 F. App’x 885, 888 (10th Cir. 2013).  In that case,\nenvironmental groups sued to enjoin the construction of the Gulf Coast Pipeline and sought a\npreliminary injunction until their case could be litigated fully.  The court found that because the\nenormous cost of delaying the project (“hundreds of thousands of dollars each day,” id. at 890) could\nnot be justified by a “minimal impact on the environment,” ibid., the plaintiffs failed to show that\nthe balance of the equities favored them.  That case is not persuasive.  The harm in this case is not\n-31-\n\nenvironmental; it concerns public health and safety.  The “minimal” harm posed by the pipeline\nconstruction in Bostick pales to the dangers posed by lead in Flint’s drinking water and the daily\nstruggles Flint residents have endured to obtain safe drinking water for the past year. \nMoreover, in the Sixth Circuit, “[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time\nand energy necessarily expended’ in compliance with an injunction ‘are not enough’” to show a\nsubstantial harm.  United States v. Edward Rose & Sons, 384 F.3d 258, 264 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting \nBaker v. Adams County/Ohio Valley School Board, 310 F.3d 927, 930 (6th Cir. 2002)).  And, as the\nplaintiffs point out, the harm to be remediated by the injunction is largely of the defendants’ making. \nSee Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d 1104, 1116 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that where state defendants\nproceeded with the construction of a highway project without complying with various environmental\nstatutes and “‘jumped the gun’ on the environmental issues by entering into contractual obligations\nthat anticipated a pro forma result,” injunctive relief was proper in part because “the state defendants\nare largely responsible for their own harm,” and the environmental harms from proceeding without\nproper compliance with the statutes outweighed the costs to the defendants).  \nFinally, the financial harm to the defendants can be mitigated by scaling back the scope of\ninjunctive relief sought in a way that ensures the benefit of safe drinking water in each household. \nAs noted above, water filters can provide homes with safe drinking water that complies with the\nLead and Copper Rule regulations if those filters are installed and maintained properly.  The\ndefendants need not deliver water to homes that have properly installed and maintained faucet water\nfilters, as long as the defendants can monitor and verify the effectiveness of the filters.  \nIt is clear that the interim relief the plaintiffs seek would provide a concrete benefit for many\nFlint residents.  Flint’s monetary concerns, although valid, are not enough to tip the scale in their\n-32-\n\nfavor in light of the physical harm Flint residents have been exposed to during this water crisis. \nMoreover, the Flint defendants would not be required to shoulder the full cost if the plaintiffs’\nrequested relief is granted.  This factor also favors the plaintiffs.\nIV.  The Public Interest\nThere can be no dispute that “the public interest at stake here, the quality of public drinking\nwater and the health and safety of the consumers, is fundamental.”  United States v. Alisal Water\nCorp., 431 F.3d 643, 656 (9th Cir. 2005).  Where the public interest is involved, “equitable powers\nassume an even broader and more flexible character than when only a private controversy is at\nstake.”  Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946).  “Unless a statute in so many\nwords, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court’s jurisdiction in equity, the\nfull scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.”  Ibid.  The SDWA gives the district\ncourt authority to enter “such judgment as protection of public health may require.”  42 U.S.C. §\n300g–3(b).\nThe Flint defendants argue that granting this preliminary injunction would force the City to\nreallocate both personnel and money away from its most critical priority: restoring its water system. \nThey argue that such relief would contravene the public interest because it would prolong the water\ncrisis in Flint.  The plaintiffs argue that the relief they seek is the type of relief contemplated for\nthose that seek exemptions from the Lead and Copper Rule.  40 C.F.R. § 142.62(f)-(h).  The\nplaintiffs have the better argument.  \nThere is no evidence that an injunction will necessarily halt or delay restoration of Flint’s\nwater system.  And even if it did delay the process, it is in the public interest to address the\nimmediate health and safety needs of residents before addressing the long-term needs.  Here, the\n-33-\n\nplaintiffs seek a stop-gap measure that provides ready access to safe drinking water.  It is in the best\ninterest of everyone to move people out of harms way before addressing the source of the harm.\nThe Flint defendants also argue that Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976), counsels courts\nto be reluctant to enjoin governmental bodies.  But in that case — which addressed the district\ncourt’s insertion of “itself by injunctive decree into the internal disciplinary affairs of [a] state\nagency,” id. at 380 — the Supreme Court merely reiterated the “settled rule that in federal equity\ncases the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.” Id. at 378 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\nHere, the Court is not being asked to meddle with an agency’s internal operations.  The\nplaintiffs are seeking temporary relief to provide Flint residents basic life necessities while the water\ncrisis is resolved.  Furthermore, even with the proposed injunctive relief, the defendants still enjoy\nwide latitude to address Flint’s water needs.  How the water crisis is resolved ultimately will be left\nto the City of Flint and the State of Michigan.  Nonetheless, there is an immediate danger to Flint\nresidents, and the nature of the defendants’ violations reasonably justify the relief ordered herein. \nThere is already a water distribution mechanism in place, so the relief the plaintiffs seek in light of\nwhat is already being provided may be a far less drastic than the defendants believe.  The public\ninterest factor favors the plaintiffs.\nV.  Remedy\nThis lawsuit was prompted by the lead contamination of the Flint water delivery system.  The\ninterim relief is intended to provide a rough substitute for the essential service that municipal water\nsystems must furnish: delivery of safe drinking water at the point of use.  The Court is convinced\nthat this service can be achieved by means of the current water main and service line infrastructure,\n-34-\n\naugmented by effective faucet filters that are installed and maintained properly.  If the defendants\ncannot establish that a household is so equipped, then they must deliver the water by other means. \nThey also must provide information to residents about the current state of the water distributed\nthrough the system, proper use and maintenance of filters, and points of distribution of bottled water. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction [dkt.\n#27] is GRANTED.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants, their agents and employees, and those in active\nconcert and participation with them MUST provide door-to-door bottled water delivery in the\nmanner outlined below to every non-exempt household served by the Flint Water System. \nIt is further ORDERED that an exempt household shall consist of any of the following:\nA. Any household in which the residents affirmatively opt out of door-to-door water\ndelivery;\nB. Any  household  in  which  the  residents  refuse  to  permit  the  installation  and\nmaintenance of a qualifying faucet water filter at public expense; \nC. Any household in which the defendants verify that a qualifying faucet water filter is\ninstalled and properly maintained.  \nD. Any household that is not occupied by residents.   \nA qualifying water filter (1) is a point-of-use faucet filter certified by the National Sanitation\nFoundation to remove lead up to 150 ppb and compatible with the household’s plumbing in the\nkitchen and all other locations where a filter is installed; (2) has had the faucet filter properly\ninstalled and verified as properly functioning; and (3) is periodically inspected by a qualified person\nto verify that cartridges are replaced consistent with the manufacture’s service life recommendations\nand that the water filters otherwise are maintained properly.  The defendants must inspect each filter\nto ensure the filter and cartridge have been maintained properly and are functioning.  Inspections\n-35-\n\nmust occur at least monthly for the first three months, and at least every other month thereafter.  The\ndefendants must provide instructions to one or more adult residents regarding the use and\nmaintenance (including the frequency for changing cartridges) of any filter used by or installed at\nthat household.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the door-to-door bottled delivery program for non-exempt\nhousehold must conform to the following criteria:\nA. The defendants must confirm the number of residents in each household and  provide\neach household with four cases of bottled water per week per resident; each case must contain at\nleast the equivalent of twenty-four 0.5 liter bottles of water;\nB. The defendants may leave bottled water deliveries at each household in the program\nin an appropriate and conspicuous location if residents are not home at the time of delivery; \nC. The defendants must notify in writing residents of households that opt out of water\ndelivery that they may opt back in to receive weekly bottled water deliveries at any time by calling\n211, or another telephone number provided by the defendants. \nD. The defendants must ensure that the water distribution sites operated by the State of\nMichigan, or equivalent distribution sites, remain in operation as necessary to provide bottled water\nto those residents who opt out of the bottled water delivery program.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants must provide Flint residents with clear and\ncurrent information about lead contamination in the drinking water that states that: (1) unfiltered tap\nwater from the Flint Water System is currently unsafe for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth, or\npreparing baby formula because it may contain high levels of lead; (b) lead exposure can cause\nserious and permanent health harms, especially when consumed by pregnant women, infants,\nchildren less than six years old, and adults with high blood pressure or kidney ailments; and (c)\nfaucet filters are effective at removing lead only when properly installed and adequately maintained.\nThe notices must also list the locations, hours, and resources available at state-run water distribution\nsites, and provide a phone number, email address, and website that Flint residents can use to notify\n-36-\n\nthe defendants if they lack access to sufficient safe water and to arrange for a prompt bottled water\ndelivery or faucet filter replacement, installation, or maintenance.  The initial notices must be\ndelivered promptly, and thereafter whenever there is a material change in the information furnished. \nThe notices must be delivered in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure actual notification to each\nhousehold.   \nIt is further ORDERED that notices and instructions required by this order must be\npresented in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and Hmong. \nIt is further ORDERED that the defendant will file a status report with the Court on or\nbefore December 16, 2016 documenting compliance with each of the provisions of this order.  \nIt is further ORDERED that this order shall be effective immediately and continue until\nfurther order of the Court.\ns/David M.

Honorable David M. Lawson\nNICK A. KHOURI, FREDERICK HEADEN, \nMICHAEL A. TOWNSEND, DAVID \nMCGHEE, MICHAEL A. FINNEY, \nBEVERLY WALKER-GRIFFEA, NATASHA \nHENDERSON, and CITY OF FLINT, \nDefendants.\n_______________________________________/\nOPINION AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS\nThree organizations advocating on behalf of the citizens of Flint, Michigan, and a Flint\nresident, have turned to the federal courts for relief from the hardship visited on the population\ncaused by the mishandling of the City’s water treatment and distribution system.  The targets of their\nlawsuit are the Michigan treasurer and members of the Flint Receivership Transition Advisory Board\n(RTAB) (the State defendants), and the City of Flint and its city administrator (the Flint defendants). \nBoth defendants have filed motions to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that the federal district\ncourt should not, or cannot, get involved, and the plaintiffs should be content with the remedial\ncourse charted by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Court disagrees.  For reasons\nexplained below, the Court believes that it should not defer to the EPA’s “primary jurisdiction” to\naddress the plaintiffs’ complaints, the lawsuit is not a disguised appeal of the EPA’s January 2016\norder, the relief the plaintiffs seek is, in the main, prospective and the Eleventh Amendment does\n\nnot bar this lawsuit against the State defendants, the individual members of the RTAB are proper\ndefendants under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) because they exert control over the financial\ndecisions affecting the operation of the Flint water system, and the complaint states viable claims\nfor relief.  The motions to dismiss will be denied.\nI.\nAccording to the allegations in the complaint, the water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink\nand has not been safe to drink since April 2014.  The plaintiffs allege that in November 2011, in\nresponse to Flint’s budget deficit and mounting debt, Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial\nemergency in the city and appointed an emergency manager to take over and run the city’s\noperations.  In order to save the city money, the plaintiffs contend, the emergency manager switched\nthe city’s drinking water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, a water source known to be\ncontaminated by nearby industries.  The city and state officials allegedly failed to follow the federal\nrequirements for treating and testing drinking water for lead under the SDWA.  The plaintiffs\nmaintain that the caustic Flint River water corroded the city’s aging metal pipes and destroyed the\nprotective coating that had formed over many years, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. \nThe plaintiffs maintain that even though the defendants have stopped using the Flint River as the\ncity’s drinking water source in October 2015, the city’s water remains unsafe to drink, wash with,\nand bathe in. The plaintiffs assert that the residents of Flint have been exposed and are still being\nexposed to high levels of lead in their water, and in the past two years, the percentage of Flint\nchildren with elevated levels of lead in their blood has doubled and nearly tripled in some areas. \nThe complaint sets forth the plaintiffs’ view of the political history that emerged as a result\nof Flint’s financial travails.  In November 2011, the City of Flint was put into a state-controlled\n-2-\n\nreceivership.  Local government officials were stripped of authority in favor of state-appointed\npersonnel.  Between November 2011 and April 2015, Flint had four successive emergency\nmanagers, who were vested with broad powers to address the city’s financial emergency, including\nauthority over the city budget.  In early 2015, the emergency manager gave defendant Natasha\nHenderson full authority to direct and supervise the day-to-day operations of the city, including\nauthority to direct the head of the Department of Public Works and manage the operations of the\nwater system.  Flint’s Utilities Department is responsible for the supply and maintenance of water\nservices, which reports to the Department of Works.  The plaintiffs maintain that defendant\nHenderson has directed the operation of the water system, managed the purchase of water meters,\nplumbing supplies, and chemicals to treat Flint River water at the treatment plant.  She also allegedly\ndecided that Flint could enter into a contract with the consultants to provide design, procurement,\nand construction services to the Flint water treatment plant.   \nOn April 28, 2015, Governor Snyder removed the emergency manager and replaced him with\nan appointed Receivership Transition Advisory Board to continue to manage the city’s affairs along\nwith the city officials for the duration of the receivership.  The plaintiffs contend that since its\ninception, the RTAB has made a number of decisions directing the operation of the Flint water\nsystem.  In August 2015, the RTAB allegedly decided that Flint could enter into a multi-year\nenvironmental monitoring services contract with a testing laboratory and decided to allow Flint to\npurchase chemicals to be used to treat water at the water treatment plant.  It further decided whether\nFlint could purchase water distribution pipe repair parts for use in maintaining the water system.  \n-3-\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the RTAB is the primary, but not exclusive, state entity that\nmanaged Flint’s operations during the receivership.  They also allege that the State Treasurer,\ndefendant Nick A. Khouri, manages aspects of the city’s operations.  For example, the Mayor and\nthe City Council cannot amend the budget that was adopted by the emergency manager without\napproval of both the RTAB and the State Treasurer.  The plaintiffs further maintain that the State\nTreasurer exerts control over the Flint water system by having the final authority to decide whether\nthe water system can make large operational changes that involve budget amendments.  In early\n2014, the State Treasurer decided whether Flint could expend more than $3 million to upgrade its\nwater treatment plant to allow Flint to use the Flint River as its primary drinking water source.  And,\nthe plaintiffs allege, the State Treasurer exercised final decision-making power over the water\nsystem’s choices about where to get its drinking water.  The plaintiffs allege that the Mayor and the\nCity Council were stripped of all authority except as specifically authorized in writing by the\nemergency manager prior to the elimination of the position last spring. \nThe plaintiffs allege that in March 2013, Flint’s City Council voted to join the Karegnondi\nWater Authority (KWA), a newly formed water supply system that would have a new operational\npipeline available in June 2016.  The City Council’s vote to join the KWA could only be authorized\nby the emergency manager and State Treasurer.  The plaintiffs allege that the State Treasurer\nrejected Detroit’s final offer to continue to receive water from Detroit while the KWA pipeline was\ncompleted. \nThe problem, the plaintiffs contend, was that the City of Flint had not treated its own water\non a regular basis for nearly fifty years.  And it had never undertaken the analysis required by the\nSDWA to identify and understand how a water system optimizes corrosion control treatment for\n-4-\n\ndrinking water.  The plaintiffs allege that in 2011, outside consultants for the city analyzed whether\nthe Flint River could be used as the city’s permanent primary source of drinking water.  The\nconsultants allegedly concluded that it would require about $50 million in upgrades to the equipment\nand systems to assure reliable and safe drinking water to customers.   Nonetheless, the plaintiffs\nallege, the water system was not upgraded with all of the recommended improvements in advance\nof distributing the Flint River water to customers’ homes in 2014.  And the water was distributed\nwithout any treatment to reduce its corrosivity and to minimize the leaching of lead from the pipes\nand solder into the drinking water. \nThe plaintiffs allege that Flint residents began raising concerns about the safety of their\ndrinking water nearly two years ago.  However, government officials dismissed their concerns and\ninsisted that the water was safe to drink.  The state officials allegedly disregarded researchers’\nfindings that the water contained dangerously high levels of lead.  The plaintiffs allege that the\ndamage done to the city pipes from the Flint River water means that lead will continue to\ncontaminate Flint’s drinking water unabated.  The ongoing contamination, the plaintiffs allege, poses\nan ongoing health risk to city residents and in particular young children, who are the most vulnerable\nto the effects of lead. \nOn October 1, 2015, the plaintiffs petitioned the United States Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) to issue an emergency order in response to Flint’s water crisis as authorized by the\nSDWA.  On January 21, 2016, the EPA issued an Emergency Administrative Order (EPA Order)\ndirecting Flint and the State of Michigan to take certain steps to begin to address the crisis, including\nproviding certain information to the public on a website and to the EPA, planning for optimization\nof water treatment to control corrosion, and retaining personnel qualified to ensure compliance with\n-5-\n\nthe SDWA’s requirements.  The purpose of the EPA Order was to “make sure” that the defendants\ntake “actions to protect public health . . . immediately.” \nThe plaintiffs filed the present action on January 27, 2016 alleging violations of certain\nfederal regulations enacted under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f, et seq.  They\nbring four separate claims: (1) Violations of the SDWA’s requirement to operate and maintain\noptimal corrosion control treatment, 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.81 .82; (2) violations of the SDWA’s\nrequirements for monitoring tap water for lead, 40 C.F.R. § 141.86; (3) violations of the SDWA’s\nreporting requirements, 40 C.F.R. § 141.90; and (4) violations of the SDWA’s notification\nrequirements, 40 C.F.R. § 141.85.  The plaintiffs are seeking a judgment declaring that all of the\ndefendants are in violation of their obligations under the SDWA and its implementing regulations. \nThey also ask to enjoin the defendants from ongoing and future violations of the SDWA and its\nimplementing regulations, ordering the defendants to take all such actions to remedy the violations\nof the SDWA, and ordering a complete replacement of all lead service lines in the water system at\nno cost to customers of the water system.  The plaintiffs also ask for preliminary injunctive relief\nto address the immediate concerns of Flint residents’ need to access safe water for drinking and\nhousehold needs.  \nUpon filing, the case was assigned to another judge in this district, who disqualified himself\nat the defendants’ request on April 26, 2016.  The defendants responded to the complaint with\nmotions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) & (6).  This Court heard oral\narguments on those motions on May 13, 2016.\n-6-\n\nII.\nA.\nThe Flint defendants argue in their motion to dismiss that this Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction because the plaintiffs in reality are seeking review of a final order issued by the EPA,\nwhich must be taken to a circuit court, not a district court.  They invoke Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(1), which “provides for the dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.”  Cartwright v. Garner, 751 F.3d 752, 759 (6th Cir. 2014).  This challenge amounts to\na “factual attack” on the Court’s jurisdiction, because a determination requires consideration of\nevidence not included in the complaint.  Ibid.  That evidence here consists of the EPA’s emergency\nadministrative order dated January 21, 2016.  “In the case of a factual attack, a court has broad\ndiscretion with respect to what evidence to consider in deciding whether subject matter jurisdiction\nexists, including evidence outside of the pleadings, and has the power to weigh the evidence and\ndetermine the effect of that evidence on the court’s authority to hear the case.”  Id. at 759-60.  The\n“[p]laintiff bears the burden of establishing that subject matter jurisdiction exists.”  Id. at 760 (citing\nDLX, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 381 F.3d 511, 516 (6th Cir. 2004)).\nOn January 21, 2016, the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance issued\nan emergency administrative order, in which it found that the “Respondents”   the City of Flint,\nthe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the State of Michigan   had operated the\nFlint Water System in such a way as to introduce contaminants into the system that “present[ed] an\nimminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons” who had a right to assume that the\nwater was safe for human consumption.  EPA Emergency Admin. Order ¶¶ 45, 33 (Jan. 21, 2016). \nThe EPA then ordered the Respondents to engage in certain reporting and information disclosure\n-7-\n\nrequirements, respond to the Flint Task Force recommendations, and comply with various water\ntreatment obligations.  The EPA also directed the Respondents to submit a plan to address corrosion\ncontrol and water quality parameters, and it prohibited the transition to a new water source unless\ncertain conditions had been fulfilled.  The parties bound by the EPA’s order are the “Respondents\nand their officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns.”  Id. ¶ 65.  The order was “a final\nagency action by EPA.”  Id. ¶ 74.      \nThe Flint defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ complaint is an implicit request for judicial\nreview of the EPA Order, and therefore this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, because under\nthe SDWA a petition for judicial review of a final action by the Administrator of the EPA can only\nbe reviewed by the circuit court in which the petitioner resides.  They reason that granting any of\nthe relief requested by the plaintiffs would necessarily differ from that of the EPA and would be\nsubstituting the Court’s judgment for that of the EPA in several areas.  For one, they say that the\nEPA did not find that the defendants violated the various provisions of the Lead and Copper Rule,\n40 C.F.R. § 141.80, et seq., as the plaintiffs contend.  They also point out that the plaintiffs seek\nrelief that exceeds the scope of that ordered by the EPA.  And the Flint defendants observe that the\ninjunctive relief that the plaintiffs seek   including replacement of all of the lead pipe service lines\n(privately owned lines included), and equitable relief to mitigate the health and medical risks from\nthe defendants’ violations   goes beyond what the EPA determined was necessary to protect the\nhealth of Flint residents.  The Flint defendants argue that granting these requests amounts to judicial\nreview of the EPA Order.\nCongress has allocated the responsibility for reviewing EPA actions under the SDWA among\nthe various circuit and district courts.  A final EPA action under that Act “may be filed in the circuit\n-8-\n\nin which the petitioner resides or transacts business which is directly affected by the action.”  42\nU.S.C. § 300j-7(a)(2).  That statute, however, does not directly answer the question of this Court’s\nsubject matter jurisdiction.   \nSubject matter jurisdiction refers to “the courts’ statutory or constitutional power to\nadjudicate the case.”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (emphasis in\noriginal).  Federal courts have “the authority to decide cases that the Constitution and Congress have\nempowered them to resolve.”  Ohio ex rel. Skaggs v. Brunner, 549 F.3d 468, 474 (6th Cir. 2008). \nCongress has empowered district courts to hear civil actions against a city or state government by\ncitizens brought under the SDWA, subject to two conditions.  42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a).  First, the\nplaintiffs may not file a suit 60 days before giving notice of the violation to the Administrator of the\nEPA, the alleged violator, and the state in which the violation is occurring.  42 U.S.C. §\n300j-8(b)(1).  Second, a civil action may not commence “if the Administrator, the Attorney General,\nor the State has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a court of the United\nStates to require compliance with such requirement.”  42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe plaintiffs filed the present action more than 60 days after giving notice of the alleged\nviolations to the relevant parties and no civil actions have commenced by the Administrator of the\nEPA, the Attorney General, or the State of Michigan against the Flint defendants.  The plaintiffs say\nthat Jones v. City of Lakeland, Tennessee, 224 F.3d 518 (6th Cir. 2000) (en banc), supports their\nposition.  In that case, the court held that a provision of the Clean Water Act, which prevented a\nprivate action when the EPA or a state agency was “diligently prosecuting” an enforcement action,\ndid not bar the plaintiffs’ lawsuit against a local city for polluting a creek.  The state agency had\nissued a number of compliance orders.  But the court held that the preclusion language barred a\n-9-\n\ncitizen-suit only if the agency was “diligently prosecuting an enforcement action in a court of the\nUnited States or of a State.”  Id. at 522 (emphasis added).  Because the state administrative agency\nwas prosecuting the action on its own authority and not in a federal or state court, the citizen suit\nwas allowed to proceed.  \nThe Flint defendants acknowledge that the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)(1), authorizes \ncitizen-suits.  Nonetheless, they insist that citizen-suits are prohibited by 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(e) when\nthe suit amounts to judicial review.  In fact, that statute explicitly prohibits judicial review of agency\nactions “except as provided in section 300j-7 of this title.”  42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(e).  They argue that\nJones is distinguishable because the Clean Water Act does not contain a blanket prohibition on using\ncitizen suits to judicially review EPA orders like the SDWA’s section 300j-8(e).  \nThat distinction is not persuasive.  Although the Clean Water Act does not contain an express\nprovision for judicial review of EPA compliance orders, compliance orders issued by the EPA are\nreviewable in district courts under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq.  Sackett\nv. E.P.A., 132 S. Ct. 1367, 1374 (2012) (The Administrative Procedure Act “creates a presumption\nfavoring judicial review of administrative action.”); Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. Sec’y of Labor, 763 F.3d\n627, 632 (6th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he normal default rule is that persons seeking review of agency action\ngo first to district court rather than to a court of appeals.”) (internal marks and citations omitted). \nTherefore, the same prohibition would seem to apply under the Clean Water Act, and the lack of an\nexpress provision in the act is not informative here.  Jones supports the plaintiffs’ position. \nHowever, as the Flint defendants note, it does not fully address their argument that the Court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction because this case is an impermissible judicial review of the EPA Order\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(e).  \n-10-\n\n The defendants point out that the Sixth Circuit recently provided guidance when an action\nconstitutes judicial review in Mokdad v. Lynch, 804 F.3d 807, 813 (6th Cir. 2015), a case that does\nnot support their position.  However, the defendants do not examine Mokdad; rather, they rely on\nits reference to City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U.S. 320 (1958), which the court of\nappeals characterized as “[t]he leading Supreme Court case discussing the scope of exclusive-\njurisdiction provisions.”  Mokdad, 804 F.3d at 813.  In City of Tacoma, the city intended to construct\na power project on a river where the State of Washington owned a fish hatchery.  The power project\ncould not be built without condemnation of the state’s hatchery, because the proposed dams would\nflood the hatchery.  Tacoma sought and received a license to proceed with their power project by\nthe Federal Power Commission, under the Federal Power Act, over the vigorous objections of the\nstate.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the issuance of the license and the state appealed to the Supreme\nCourt.  While that appeal was pending, Tacoma proceeded with its plans for the power project and\nfiled an action in state court that would declare valid an issuance of bonds to finance the project. \nThe state opposed the action raising the same issues it had in the previous licensing proceedings. \nThe state court case was appealed to the state supreme court twice and ultimately resulted in an\ninjunction preventing Tacoma from proceeding with the project.  But the Supreme Court reversed\nthe state supreme court, holding that the exclusive review provision of the Federal Power Act\n“necessarily  precluded  de  novo  litigation  between  the  parties  of  all  issues  inhering  in  the\ncontroversy, and all other modes of judicial review.”  357 U.S. at 336.\nCity of Tacoma is distinguishable on a number of bases.  For one, the plaintiffs are not a\nparty to an action between the EPA and the City of Flint.  Nor are the plaintiffs identified as\n“Respondents” in the EPA’s emergency order.  Moreover, the plaintiffs are not subject to the EPA\n-11-\n\nOrder and are not asking for relief from the EPA Order.  The plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin the\nEPA Order either explicitly or implicitly.  See F.C.C. v. ITT World Commc’ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463,\n468 (1984) (holding that a party “may not evade [statutory exclusive-jurisdiction] provisions by\nrequesting the District Court to enjoin action that is the outcome of the agency’s order).  Rather they\nare asserting their own rights under the SDWA.  As the Mokdad court observed, “[l]ater decisions\nof the Supreme Court have reiterated that exclusive-jurisdiction provisions bar litigants from\n‘requesting the District Court to enjoin action that is the outcome of the agency’s order,’ but not\nclaims that are ‘wholly collateral to a statute’s review provisions.’”  Mokdad, 804 F.3d at 813\n(quoting ITT World Commc’ns, 466 U.S. at 468, and  Thunder Basin Coal Co. V. Reich, 510 U.S.\n200, 212 (1994)).  \nThe Sixth Circuit used the concept of “inescapable intertwinement” as an aid in determining\nwhether a lawsuit was barred by an exclusive jurisdiction provision in a statute governing appeals\nof administrative agency orders.  Citing precedent from other circuits, the court stated that “‘[a]\nclaim is inescapably intertwined [with an agency order] if it alleges that the plaintiff was injured by\nsuch an order and that the court of appeals has authority to hear the claim on direct review of the\nagency order.’” Ibid. (quoting Merritt v. Shuttle, Inc., 245 F.3d 182, 187 (2d Cir. 2001)) (alteration\nin original).  Here, the plaintiffs do not allege that their injury stems from the EPA’s emergency\norder.  In fact, the plaintiffs likely would endorse many of its findings.  And even if the relief\nrequested by the plaintiffs may overlap or even be inconsistent with the EPA Order, the SDWA\nprovides for intervention by the EPA in a citizen-suit or by a citizen in a suit brought by the EPA. \n42 U.S.C.A. § 300j-8(b)(1)(B), (c).  \n-12-\n\nThe plaintiffs’ present suit does not amount to an appeal of a final determination by the EPA. \nThe relief they seek may parallel the EPA’s directives to the Flint and Michigan respondents, and\nmay augment those orders.  And their action is wholly collateral to the SDWA’s review provisions. \nThe Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a), unaffected by\nsection 300j-7 or section 300j-8(e).  \nB.\nThe  state  defendants  make  a  related  argument:  that  the  Court  should  abstain  from\nadjudicating the complaint and defer to the EPA under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.  Under\nthat doctrine, a court may stay or dismiss a proceeding if it finds that the matter lay within the\nprimary jurisdiction of an administrative agency to allow the parties the reasonable opportunity to\nseek an administrative ruling.  United States v. Haun, 124 F.3d 745, 749 (6th Cir. 1997); see Alltel\nTennessee, Inc. v. Tennessee Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 913 F.2d 305, 307 (6th Cir. 1990).  “The doctrine\nof primary jurisdiction arises when a claim is properly cognizable in court but contains some issue\nwithin the special competence of an administrative agency.”  Id. at 749 50.  The state defendants\nargue that this case involves complex factual and scientific questions that are outside the Court’s\nconventional experience, and the Court may be called upon to determine the most appropriate\nmanner in which to abate any violations of the SDWA requiring the resolution of complicated\nenvironmental, biological, logistical, municipal, financial, and practical issues of great significance\nand impact.  They also note that EPA proceedings have begun and the agency has issued a\ncompliance order.  And the state defendants argue that primary jurisdiction is often invoked when\na plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief, because there is the greatest likelihood that a court’s order will\ninterfere with an administrative agency’s proceedings.  \n-13-\n\nAn analysis of abstention requests must begin with the observation that district courts have\na “virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”  Colorado River\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976).  The primary jurisdiction\ndoctrine is recognized as a means “to obtain the benefit of the expertise and experience of the\nadministrative agencies and the desirable uniformity which occurs when a specialized agency\ndecides certain administrative questions.”  Alltel Tennessee,, 913 F.2d at 309 (citing In re Long\nDistance Telecommunications Litigation, 831 F.2d 627, 630 (6th Cir. 1987).  But the court should\n“defer[] to an administrative agency only when the reasons for the existence of the doctrine are\npresent.”  Ibid. (citing United States v. Western Pacific, 352 U.S. 59, 64 (1956)).  The Supreme\nCourt has observed that “[n]o fixed formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.” \nUnited States v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 64 (1956)).  \nThe state defendants argue that this case involves complex factual and scientific questions\nthat are outside the Court’s conventional experience, but that does not appear to be the case.  The\nplaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated the SDWA.  That\ndetermination does not require reviewing environmental impact reports or considering the content\nof lead in the drinking water.  It merely requires determining whether the defendants complied with\nthe statute, which is well within the Court’s expertise.  Furthermore, the injunctive relief in this case\nfocuses on obtaining clean drinking water for the residents of Flint.  Whether such relief requires\nthe defendants to supply water filters to every Flint resident or replace all of the lead service lines,\nthe expertise required is no more than inquiring into whether the lead levels in the water are above\nor below the prescribed amount, and what remedial measures may suffice to cause compliance.  It\nmay be that the lead service lines can be made safe again through proper water treatment and all that\n-14-\n\nis needed is temporary injunctive relief to allow time for that to occur.  “A federal court may not\nabdicate its adjudicative duty simply because an action sounds an administrative tone.”  Haun, 124\nF.3d at 752.\nThe state defendants rely on Harding-Wright v. District of Columbia Water and Sewer\nAuthority, 04-00558 (D.C. 2004).  That case is similar in many ways to this one.  In Harding-Wright,\nthe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) made a change in its water treatment\nthat resulted in increased levels of lead in the drinking water.  Harding-Wright, Ex. 1 at p. 5.  To\nhelp alleviate the harm, WASA and the EPA worked on a series of interim measures to ensure the\nsafety of drinking water, such as making an interim water supply available and making certified\nwater filters available to the 23,000 homes that had been affected by the high levels of lead in the\ndrinking water.  Id. at 10.  The Harding-Wright court granted in part the defendant’s motion to\ndismiss because it found that fashioning an interim remediation plan independent of what the EPA\nalready required was better left to the expertise of the EPA.  Id. at 20.  Furthermore, the plaintiffs\nwere asking the court to order the defendants to distribute water filters to a greater number of\nresidents than had already been required under a consent administrative order, and would therefore\nresult in inconsistent judgments.  Id. at 22.  \nHarding-Wright is informative; however, the EPA had already entered an Administrative\nOrder for Compliance on Consent that mandated replacement of some of the lead service lines and\nthe provision of water filters to 23,000 affected homes.  The court deferred to the EPA under the\nprimary jurisdiction doctrine in a case where the EPA had taken more substantial steps than have\nbeen taken thus far in Flint.  It appears that much more remains to be done here, and the plaintiffs\nare entitled to seek other avenues of relief.    \n-15-\n\nThe state defendants also argue that EPA proceedings have begun and they have issued a\ncompliance order, which would weigh in favor of staying the current proceeding.  The plaintiffs\nrespond that there is no decision pending with the EPA that would be relevant to this case.  The\nplaintiffs have the better argument.  In Haun, the Sixth Circuit explained that one of the reasons to\nstay a proceeding under the primary jurisdiction doctrine is to allow the parties the opportunity to\nseek an administrative ruling.  Haun, 124 F.3d at 749.  The EPA issued its compliance order on\nJanuary 21, 2016.  The SDWA allows for   and even contemplates   concurrent actions.  42\nU.S.C.A. § 300j-8(b)(1)(B), (c).  As the plaintiffs point out, there are no questions before the EPA\nthat must be answered before the plaintiffs’ claims can be adjudicated by this Court.  \nFinally, the state defendants argue that primary jurisdiction is often invoked when a plaintiff\nis seeking injunctive relief, because there is the greatest likelihood that a court’s order will interfere\nwith an administrative agency’s proceedings.  See B.H. v. Gold Fields Mining Corp., 506 F. Supp.\n2d 792, 798 (N.D. Okla. 2007).   In B.H. the EPA ordered remediation of a 40-square-mile area\nwhere lead contamination had been found.  The plaintiffs were seeking injunctive relief that the\ncourt found would likely conflict with the EPA’s remediation plan.  The B.H. court stayed the action\npending the resolution of the EPA’s remediation plan under the primary jurisdiction doctrine\nbecause the cleanup of environmental hazards fell squarely within the EPA’s expertise, and\ninjunctive relief would have interfered with the remediation effort. But here, the plaintiffs are not\nseeking relief that would likely interfere with the EPA’s compliance order.  Instead, the relief the\nplaintiffs are seeking would be consistent with the order.  The danger of creating inconsistent\nobligations for the defendants is relatively low in this case, because the EPA and the plaintiffs are\nseeking the same result: safe drinking water for the residents of Flint.\n-16-\n\nThis does not appear to be a case that will require intricate fact finding or the need for special\nadministrative expertise.  Nor does there appear to be an administrative program that may be upset\nby the Court’s decisions.  The plaintiffs are seeking to enforce their rights under the SDWA.  The\nrelief sought is both similar and different than what has been ordered in the EPA Order, but not\nconflicting.  The state defendants have not shown how such relief would be inconsistent with the\nEPA Order or would interfere with it in any way.  Because federal judges “have no more right to\ndecline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given,” United\nStates v. Haun, 124 F.3d 745, 752 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.)\n264, 404 (1821)), abstaining under the primary jurisdiction doctrine would be imprudent here.\nIII.\nThe Flint defendants contend that the complaint fails to state a viable claim, because the\nplaintiffs ask for retrospective relief, which is unavailable under the SDWA.  The state defendants\nmake a similar argument, contending that because the plaintiffs are seeking retrospective relief, their\nclaims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The state defendants also contend that the complaint\nfails to state a claim for which relief can be granted against the individual members of the Flint\nReceivership Transition Advisory Board in their official capacities, because the Board is a non-\njuridical entity.  And they also contend that the claims against the board members and the state\ntreasurer must fail because none of those individuals has the requisite control over the Flint water\nsystem.\nThese arguments are based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  “The purpose of\nRule 12(b)(6) is to allow a defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to\nlegal relief if all the facts and allegations in the complaint are taken as true.” Rippy ex rel. Rippy v.\n-17-\n\nHattaway, 270 F.3d 416, 419 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.\n1993)).  Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court views the complaint in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiff, the allegations of fact are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor\nof the plaintiff.  Bassett v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 528 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2008).  To\nsurvive a motion to dismiss under that rule, the complaint must contain “sufficient factual matter,\naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  Plausibility requires\nshowing more than the ‘sheer possibility’ of relief but less than a ‘probab[le]’ entitlement to relief. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, [556 U.S. 662, 678] (2009).”  Fabian v. Fulmer Helmets, Inc., 628 F.3d 278, 280\n(6th Cir. 2010).  “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s\nliability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’” \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).  \nUnder the new regime ushered in by Twombly and Iqbal, pleaded facts must be accepted by\nthe court, but conclusions may not be accepted unless they are plausibly supported by the pleaded\nfacts.  “[B]are assertions,” such as those that “amount to nothing more than a ‘formulaic recitation\nof the elements’” of a claim, can provide context to the factual allegations, but they are insufficient\nto state a claim for relief and must be disregarded.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 555).  However, as long as a court can “‘draw the reasonable inference that the defendant\nis liable for the misconduct alleged,’ a plaintiff’s claims must survive a motion to dismiss.”  Fabian,\n628 F.3d at 281 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). \n-18-\n\nA.\nAll the defendants characterize the relief sought by the plaintiffs as “retrospective.”  They\ninsist that the replacement of lead service lines and mitigation of health and medical risks are\nmeasures to address past violations, and therefore the relief requested is retrospective. The plaintiffs\nrecognize that retrospective relief is not available under the SDWA.  But they characterize the relief\nthey seek as prospective rather than retrospective.  They argue that replacement of lead service lines\nand mitigating the health and medical risks amount to prospective relief because those measures\naddress the ongoing violations by the defendants.  And they contend that 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)\nspecifically authorizes district courts to enforce the SDWA’s various monitoring, reporting, public\ninformation, and treatment provisions.   \n“The purpose of the [Safe Drinking Water Act] is to assure that water supply systems serving\nthe public meet minimum national standards for protection of public health.”  H.R. Rep. No.\n93-1185, at 6454 (1974).  The SDWA allows a citizen-suit against any person “alleged to be in\nviolation of any requirement prescribed” by the Act.  42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)(1).  The Sixth Circuit\nhas not interpreted this provision, but the Supreme Court interpreted the same “in violation of”\nlanguage in the Clean Water Act as requiring a citizen-plaintiff to “allege a state of either continuous\nor intermittent violation   that is, a reasonable likelihood that a past polluter will continue to\npollute in the future.”  Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., 484 U.S. 49,\n57 (1987) (noting parallel language in Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7604; Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 6972 (1982 ed. and Supp. III); Toxic Substances Control Act,\n15 U.S.C. § 2619 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV)); see United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., 684 F.2d 1174,\n-19-\n\n1188 (6th Cir. 1982) (finding that where possible, similar statutory language should be given similar\nconstruction).  The plaintiffs have done so here.\nCongress has empowered “[t]he United States district courts . . . to enforce in an action\nbrought under this subsection any requirement prescribed by or under” the SDWA.  42 U.S.C. §\n300j(a).  Although the Sixth Circuit has not interpreted the scope of this provision, other circuits\nhowever have interpreted analogous language in the Clean Water Act to mean that “[t]he authority\nto ‘enforce’ an existing requirement is more than the authority to declare that the requirement exists\nand repeat that it must be followed.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Sw. Marine, Inc., 236 F.3d 985, 1000\n(9th Cir. 2000).  Rather, as “long as the district court’s equitable measures are reasonably calculated\nto ‘remedy an established wrong,’ they are not an abuse of discretion.”  Ibid. (quoting Alaska Ctr.\nfor Env’t v. Browner, 20 F.3d 981, 986 (9th Cir. 1994)).\nThe defendants do not fairly characterize the harm alleged by the plaintiffs.  It is not, as the\ndefendants would read it, the damage to the lead service pipes.  Instead, the harm is the continued\nleaching of lead into the drinking water.  To remedy that harm, replacement of all lead service pipes\nmay be required.  Indeed, the regulations contemplate such relief.  The SDWA requires “water\nsystems” to comply with regulations designed to control lead contamination in drinking water,\nknown collectively as the Lead and Copper Rule.  40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80 .91.  The Lead and Copper\nRule mandates that “[s]ystems that fail to meet the lead action level in tap samples taken pursuant\nto § 141.86(d)(2), after installing corrosion control and/or source water treatment (whichever\nsampling occurs later), shall replace lead service lines in accordance with the requirements of this\nsection.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.84(a).  Whether those remedial measures will be required in this case\nremains to be seen.   \n-20-\n\nIn all events, the plaintiffs are seeking relief consistent with the regulations.  The plaintiffs\nallege that the corrosive water from the Flint River water destroyed the protective coating in the\nwater system that was built up over a period of years.  They also allege that corrosive water can\ndamage water pipes irreversibly, necessitating replacement.  They have stated a claim under 40\nC.F.R. § 141.84(a).  They also seek the mitigation of health and medical risks resulting from the\nalleged ongoing violations of the SDWA.  Such relief also may be called for because, as the\nplaintiffs allege, the lead is continuing to leach into the drinking water supply.  The relief the\nplaintiffs can fairly be characterized as prospective, and authorized by the SDWA.\nB.\nThis holding also impacts the state defendants’ argument that the claims against them in their\nindividual official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  \nThe Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not\nbe construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the\nUnited States by Citizens of another state, or by Citizens or subjects of any foreign State.”  U.S.\nConst. Amend. XI.  In general, the Eleventh Amendment immunizes state officials from suit in\nfederal court.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 (1984).  However, state\nsovereign immunity as recognized by the Eleventh Amendment does not extend to suits against state\nofficials seeking to enjoin violations of federal law.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-160 (1908). \nA plaintiff can “avoid[] this sovereign immunity bar by suing for injunctive or declaratory relief,\nrather than monetary relief.”  Johnson v. Unknown Dellatifa, 357 F.3d 539, 545 n.1 (6th Cir. 2004)\n(citing Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 n.10 (1989)).  To determine whether\na claim for such relief avoids sovereign immunity, “a court need only conduct ‘a straightforward\n-21-\n\ninquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief\nproperly characterized as prospective.’”  Dubuc v. Michigan Bd. of Law Examiners, 342 F.3d 610,\n616 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Comm’n of Maryland, 535\nU.S. 635, 645 (2002)).  \nAs noted above, the remedies sought by the plaintiffs plainly are forward-looking.  They do\nnot seek an award of damages or other forms of compensation to redress past injuries.  Instead, they\nseek to compel state officials to comply with federal law, a form of relief authorized under the\nEleventh Amendment.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159-160.\nC.\nThe individual members of the RTAB also argue that they can not be sued in their official\ncapacities, because an official capacity suit is tantamount to a suit against the entity itself, and the\nRTAB is immune from suit because it is a non-juridical entity.  They contend that the legislation\ncreating the RTAB supports the conclusion that the entity was not intended to be amenable to suit,\nand the entity has no legal means of raising funds for payment of a judgment.\nThat argument “ha[s] been consistently rejected by the courts.”  Telespectrum, Inc. v. Pub.\nServ. Comm’n of Kentucky, 227 F.3d 414, 422 (6th Cir. 2000); see, e.g., Michigan Bell Tel. Co. v.\nClimax Tel. Co., 202 F.3d 862, 868 (6th Cir. 2000) (allowing an action against the individual\nmembers of the Michigan Public Service Commission under Ex parte Young).  Moreover, the state\ncourt cases cited in support of their argument concern money damages, which is what prompted the\nMichigan Supreme Court to say that “[i]t cannot be true that such an agency can be officially liable\nto suits for liabilities, where it has no legal means of raising funds for payment.”  O’Leary v. Bd. of\nFire & Water Comm’rs of Marquette, 79 Mich. 281, 286, 44 N.W. 608, 610 (1890).  Here, the\n-22-\n\nplaintiffs are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against individual state officials, consistent\nwith Ex Parte Young.\nD.\nThe state defendants also argue that they are immune from suit from the requirements of the\nSDWA because they are not responsible as a “supplier of water,” since they do not “own[] or\noperate[] a public water system.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 300f(5).  They maintain that as the State\nTreasurer and as individual members of the Flint Receivership Transition Advisory Board, they lack\nthe requisite control over the Flint water system to ensure compliance with the SDWA or its\nregulations.  They argue that they merely have financial monitoring responsibility over the city, not\nany level of operational control. The plaintiffs disagree and allege that the state defendants have\ntaken actions that should result in a finding that they are “operators” of the Flint water system within\nthe meaning of the SDWA.  \nThe term “operator” is not defined in the SDWA.  42 U.S.C. 300f(4)(A).  However, the term\nis found in other environmental statutes, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).  Under CERCLA, “operator” is defined as\n“any person owning or operating” a facility.  42 U.S.C. § 9601(20)(A)(ii).  The Supreme Court gave\nthe term in CERCLA its “ordinary meaning” as “someone who directs the workings of, manages,\nor conducts the affairs of a facility.”  United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 66 (1998).  The Court\nrecognized that “operate” means “more than mere mechanical activation of pumps and valves, and\nmust be read to contemplate ‘operation’ as including the exercise of direction over the facility’s\nactivities.”  Id. at 71.  \n-23-\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the state defendants all had significant operational control over the\nFlint water system, including the decision to use the water from the Flint River and authorize\nexpenditures to upgrade the water system in preparation for using Flint River water.  The plaintiffs\nallege that the RTAB worked with the city officials to manage the city, that the city administrator\nhad direct control over the water supply, and the State Treasurer made decisions that directly\nimpacted the Flint water system.\nThe state defendants argue that they did not have the authority to exert operational control\nover the Flint water system.  The significance of that reality, they say, lies in the fact that none of\nthe state defendants have the authority to implement the relief the plaintiffs are requesting. \nHowever, the plaintiffs have alleged that the RTAB must authorize all contracts or purchases over\n$75,000, and the State Treasurer has the final decision-making authority over where Flint gets its\ndrinking water and must approve any amendments to the budget.  It is difficult to imagine how the\nplaintiffs could obtain the relief they request without the participation and cooperation   coerced\nor otherwise   of the state defendants.  \nCourts have found that the financial authority and level involvement as alleged by the\nplaintiffs here to be relevant under CERCLA on the question of operator liability.  See K.C.1986 Ltd.\nP’ship v. Reade Mfg., 472 F.3d 1009, 1020 (8th Cir. 2007) ( finding relevant that defendant’s\napproval was necessary for any decisions involving large expenditures); see also Exxon Mobil Corp.\nv. United States, 108 F. Supp. 3d 486, 531 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (finding relevant that the government,\namong other things, approved any expenditure exceeding $1,000); Clean Harbors, Inc. v. CBS\nCorp., 875 F. Supp. 2d 1311, 1327-28 (D. Kan. 2012) (finding relevant the requirement that a\ndefendant approve significant operational expenses).  Commenting on these cases, the state\n-24-\n\ndefendants concede that financial control was a relevant consideration, but they argue that it was not\ndeterminative in those cases.  The state defendants are correct.  Those cases found operator liability\nbased on more than simply financial control.  However, those cases were adjudicated at the summary\njudgment stage.   Here, the plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to state a claim that the state\ndefendants have exerted a level of control to bring them within the scope of the SDWA’s\nrequirements. \nIV.\nThe Court has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThose claims are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  And the complaint states claims against\nall the defendants for which relief can be granted.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendants’ motions to dismiss [dkt. #22, 23] are\nDENIED.\nIt is further ORDERED that counsel for the parties shall appear before the Court for a status\nconference on August 3, 2016 at 3:00 p.m. to discuss adjudication of the plaintiffs’ motion for\npreliminary injunction and further case management. \ns/David M.

Lawson, District Judge. \nDecided and Filed:  December 16, 2016 \n \nBefore:  KEITH, SUTTON, and DONALD, Circuit Judges. \nThe court delivered a PER CURIAM order.  SUTTON, J. (pp. 5–13), delivered a separate \ndissenting opinion. \n_________________ \nORDER \n_________________ \n  The Treasurer of the State of Michigan and the members of the Flint Receivership \nTransition Advisory Board (jointly referred to as the “State Defendants”) appeal a preliminary \ninjunction requiring, among other things, the delivery of bottled water to non-exempt households \nserved by the Flint water system.  They move to stay the injunction pending appeal.  Flint \nresponds in support of the motion for a stay.  The Plaintiffs oppose the motion to stay.  The State \nDefendants filed a reply in support of their motion.  The district court denied a stay pending \nappeal on December 2, 2016. \n1 \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 2\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 2 \n \n  As a preliminary matter, we grant the parties’ motions to exceed the page limitations of \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 27(d)(2).  The Plaintiffs’ motion to strike is granted because \nthe State Defendants’ reply brief raises an argument that was not raised in the motion for a stay, \nthus obviating the Plaintiff’s need to file a sur-reply. \nAs  the  movants,  the  State  Defendants  “bear[]  the  burden  of  showing  that  the \ncircumstances justify” the exercise of discretion to grant a stay of the preliminary injunction \npending appeal.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433–34 (2009).  Four factors guide the court’s \nconsideration of the motion for a stay: (1) whether the State Defendants have a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) whether they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay; \n(3) whether the requested injunctive relief will substantially injure other interested parties; and \n(4) where the public interest lies.  Id. at 434; see also Ohio St. Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. \nHusted, 769 F.3d 385, 387 (6th Cir. 2014); Serv. Emps. Int’l Union Local 1 v. Husted, 698 F.3d \n341, 343 (6th Cir. 2012).  These four factors “are not prerequisites that must be met, but \ninterrelated considerations that must be balanced.”  In re EPA, 803 F.3d 804, 806 (6th Cir. 2015). \nThe State Defendants’ argument that the injunction is overbroad and lacks evidentiary \nsupport is based on the erroneous belief that the central component of the injunctive relief is the \ndoor-to-door delivery of bottled water.  This is not the case.  For homes that have properly \ninstalled water filters, bottled delivery is not ordered.  It is only ordered for homes where there is \nno proper filter in place.  For many without a proper filter, as the testimony demonstrates, \nobtaining  drinking  water  is  inaccessible  due  in  part  to  the  limited  hours  of  the  points  of \ndistribution and transportation issues.  The likelihood of success on the merits is slim. \nFurthermore, the State Defendants’ disingenuous claim that the daily delivery of bottled \nwater  would  be  at  an  expense  of  $10.5  million  a  month,  is  not  supported  by  the  record.  \nAccording to Michigan State Police Captain Christopher Kelenske, the $10.5 million figure is \nbased on the idea that five cases of water would have to be delivered to anywhere from 30,000 \nand 34,000 homes in Flint each week, based on the number of homes that rely on the Flint water \nsystem.  However, Captain Kelenske also testified that under his watch every home in Flint has \nbeen visited and 96% of homes have new water filters, and the remaining 1,000 to 1,500 homes \nmay include some homes that are unoccupied.  According to the State Defendants, the cost of \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 3\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 3 \n \nverifying the proper installation and maintenance of water filters is $955,971.  The cost of \nverifying and maintaining water filters and delivering bottled water to residents that are not part \nof the allegedly 96% of homes that already have a functioning water filter is nowhere near $10.5 \nmillion.  Additionally, there is still $100 million left of the $212 million that Michigan allocated \nto respond to the Flint water crisis.  Therefore, the State Defendants will not suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of a stay. \nFlint residents continue to suffer irreparable harm from the lack of reliable access to safe \ndrinking water.  Many residents who rely on filters that are improperly installed continue to be at \nrisk of exposure to lead.  Compliance with the order only requires that the State Defendants \ndeliver bottled water to homes until they ensure that a home has a properly installed and \nmaintained water filter, or if the residents opt-out of the delivery service. \nIt is important to remember that there are still people in Flint that do not have access to \nsafe drinking water.  In the absence of this injunction, it is unclear how the State Defendants plan \nto ensure that every resident in Flint has safe drinking water.  The State Defendants’ contend that \ndelivering bottled water to Flint residents will slow down the recovery of Flint’s water system by \nsignificantly decreasing the amount of water moving through the Flint water system delivery \nlines.  First, even where no effective water filter is in place, bottled water delivery would only \nreplace a small fraction of household water use.  According to the EPA, an average family of \nfour uses 400 gallons of water per day, 70% of which is indoor usage that includes 26.7% toilet, \n21.7%  clothes  washing,  16.8%  shower,  15.6%  faucet,  13.7%  leaks,  and  $5.3%  other.  \nhttps://www3.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html (last visited December 2, 2016).   \nSecond, it cannot be overstated that it is an immediate requirement, under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act’s (SDWA) Lead and Copper Rule that the State Defendants’ provide safe \ndrinking water to all residents of Flint.  Although there may be no known precedent for the door-\nto-door delivery of bottled water, there is also no precedent for the systematic infrastructure \ndamage  to  a  water  delivery  system  that  has  caused  thousands  of  people  to  be  exposed  to \npoisonous water.  The injunction is in place to ensure that those people have access to clean \nwater.  The injunction is tailored to the specific systemic harms found and is appropriate in \nscope.  For those reasons, the stay of the preliminary injunction must be denied. \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 4\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 4 \n \nThe State Defendants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on their \nchallenges  to  the  findings  that  the  Flint  water  system  is  not  in  compliance  with  various \nregulations promulgated under the SDWA.  Nor have they shown that portions of the preliminary \ninjunction,  including  the  provisions  requiring  the  delivery  of  bottled  water  to  non-exempt \nhouseholds, are overbroad.  Further, a stay does not support the public interest because the \nSDWA has already established that the provision of safe drinking water is an important public \ninterest.   \n  The motions to exceed the page limitations are GRANTED; the Plaintiffs’ motion to \nstrike is GRANTED.  The State Defendants’ motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending \nappeal is DENIED. \n   \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 5\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 5 \n \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nSUTTON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  I can appreciate why the district court would be \ntempted to order daily deliveries of bottled water to thousands of residents of Flint, Michigan, at \nan estimated expense of $10.5 million a month.  And I can appreciate why my colleagues would \nbe tempted to leave that order in place.  State and City officials endangered the health of many \nFlint residents by failing to monitor and limit the lead levels in the water supply.  And after the \nproblem  was  identified  in  December  2015,  it  took  some  time  for  those  same  officials  to \nacknowledge their mistakes.  Perhaps in that sense, it looks like these government officials had it \ncoming to them—that they earned the costs and logistical challenges now imposed on them by \nthe district court.   \n  But I fear that the district court’s unusual preliminary injunction will do more harm than \ngood for the people of Flint and delay rather than expedite a solution to this problem.  I have two \nkey concerns:  It’s not clear that Flint’s water violates federal law at this point and, even if it \ndoes, the order expedites the wrong thing by forcing government officials to prioritize weekly \ndeliveries of bottled water over ensuring that the new filters provided to 96% of Flint residents \nwork. \n  In the absence of a predicate finding of an ongoing violation of federal law, the district \ncourt ordered government officials to make the daily deliveries of bottled water until they could \nensure that each filter worked.  That is no small task in a city of 100,000 people.  That means the \ndoor-to-door bottled-water deliveries must begin immediately with all of the monetary and \nlogistical challenges associated with them (to say nothing of water-bottle-freezing temperatures), \nand continue until government officials prove each home has a working filter.  Perhaps there \nmight have been something to such an order a year ago, when the problem was first discovered.  \nBut at this point the City already guarantees water delivery for disabled and elderly residents, \npermits other residents to call a 211 hotline if they need water deliveries, and has nine sites \naround the city where residents can pick up all of the bottled water they need.  At this point, in \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 6\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 6 \n \nother words, the plaintiffs and defendants alike should focus on measuring current water quality \nand ensuring that each filter works.  But that most assuredly will not happen in the face of this \norder, as the government officials point out and as no one (including the district court and my \ncolleagues) can reasonably dispute given the logistical challenges of the court’s order. \n  The court had other measured options at its disposal.  Why not first order new tests of the \ncurrent quality of the water to determine whether there is an ongoing violation of federal law?  If \nthe plaintiffs establish any ongoing violations, why not enter an order designed to fix those \nviolations and ensure working filters, and then and only then threaten responsible officials with a \nrequirement of bottled-water deliveries for all if the officials could not fix any problems within a \nreasonable  period  of  time.    That  would  have  been  a  fair  and  proportionate  way  to  focus \neveryone’s attention.  But the immediate, extensive, and costly requirements of this order run the \nserious risk of undermining its goal.  For these reasons and those elaborated below, I would grant \nthe stay and urge the district court to recalibrate its order to focus on testing and monitoring \ncurrent water-quality levels and, if they remain wanting, prioritize efforts to ensure that the filters \nin each home are working.   \nI. \n  The people of Flint have been through a rough patch.  In November 2011, Governor Rick \nSnyder placed the City in state-controlled receivership after declaring a financial emergency.  At \nthe time, the City received its water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the \nsource of which is the Detroit River and Lake Huron.  The City Council voted in March 2013 to \nsave money by joining the Karegondi Water Authority, a newly formed water supply system that \nwas not yet up and running.  The Emergency Manager and the State Treasurer signed off on the \ncontract with the Karegondi Water Authority.  The Emergency Manager rejected Detroit’s offer \nto renegotiate interim rates, and the City decided to take its water from the Flint River in the \nmeantime.   \n  That did not work.  Flint had not treated the Detroit water for decades, and it neglected to \nadd critical chemicals to the highly corrosive Flint River water, including orthophosphates, \nwhich “coat the pipes so that the water is not in direct contact with the metals to prevent the \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 7\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 7 \n \nleaching of those metals into the water.”  R. 86 at 215.  The mistake ruined the water delivered to \nFlint residents.  The tap water became discolored, smelled foul, and worst of all was dangerous \nto drink.  By early 2015, the City, State, and EPA learned of high amounts of lead in the water.  \nData collected by Virginia Tech researchers showed that more than 10% of water samples in \nAugust 2015 contained more than 25 parts per billion of lead, well above the EPA action level of \n15 ppb for the 90th percentile.  40 C.F.R. § 141.80(c)(1). \n  Flint switched its water source.  It returned to the Detroit Water Department and began \nadding phosphates in December 2015 to repair the damaged chemical shield separating the lead \nfrom the water.  Flint’s mayor declared a state of emergency.  On January 5, 2016, Governor \nSnyder declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.   \n  By  April  2016,  the  National  Guard,  the  American  Red  Cross,  and  state  and  local \nemergency response teams had visited 21,291 homes and over 5,000 apartments in Flint, and had \ndistributed 84,505 water filters, 195,264 filter cartridges, 153,005 cases of water, and 24,866 \nwater test kits.  The State and City established points of distribution at fire stations and churches \nwhere anyone could pick up filters, filter cartridges, bottled water, and test kits.  Emergency \nresponse personnel eventually visited every residence in Flint, distributing at least one filter to \neveryone who was home and leaving a card with information about the 211 hotline at the rest.  \nAnyone who calls the 211 hotline receives a one-time delivery of water and water filtration \nsupplies.  For anyone who is elderly, disabled, or otherwise unable to reach one of the nine \npoints of distribution on a regular basis, the State adds the individual to the functional needs list \nand regularly delivers that person the bottled water they need.  By mid-September 2016, the \nState and City had distributed 2.7 million cases of water (over 32 million liters), 136,000 filters \n(more than one for each of Flint’s roughly 100,000 residents), 297,000 filter cartridges, and \n54,492 water test kits.   \n  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on January 27, 2016, one of dozens of lawsuits filed in \nresponse to the Flint water crisis.  The plaintiffs in this case waited several months before \nrequesting a preliminary injunction.  The district court held a hearing in mid-September and \nissued a preliminary injunction on November 10, 2016.  The crux of the district court’s order is \nthat the State and City “must confirm the number of residents in each household” in Flint “and \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 8\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 8 \n \nprovide each household with four cases of bottled water per week per resident.”  R. 96 at 36.  \nThe  only  households  exempt  from  the  order  are  those  that  affirmatively  opt  out,  that  are \npermanently unoccupied, that refuse free faucet filter installation, or that the government ensures \nhave a properly maintained and working filter.  The last exemption is the key one at issue.  The \ndistrict court gave the State and City until December 16, 2016, to comply. \nII. \n  The standard for granting a stay pending appeal is a familiar one.  We look at four \nfactors:  “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether \nissuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and \n(4) where  the  public  interest  lies.”    Nken  v.  Holder,  556  U.S.  418,  426  (2009)  (quotation \nomitted). \n  Likelihood of success on the merits.  The legal underpinning of this lawsuit is the federal \nSafe Drinking Water Act and some regulations that the EPA has promulgated under it.  The Act \nregulates “suppliers of water,” defined as “any person who owns or operates a public water \nsystem.”    42  U.S.C.  § 300f(5).    According  to  the  record,  the  State,  after  placing  Flint  in \nreceivership, began to “manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related to” Flint’s \nwater safety.  United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 66 (1998).  The State defendants had \nbroad  authority  over  the  City’s  operations,  see  Mich.  Comp.  Laws.  § 141.1549,  and  they \napparently became responsible for switching the City’s water source from the Detroit water \nauthorities to the Flint River.  The key regulation is known as the Lead and Copper Rule.  It \nrequires Flint to have “optimal corrosion control treatment” for its water system:  Namely, \ntreatment “that minimizes the lead and copper concentrations at users’ taps while insuring that \nthe treatment does not cause the water system to violate any national primary drinking water \nregulations.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  The EPA’s action level for lead is triggered when the amount \nof  lead  in  the  90th  percentile  of  water  samples  is  at  or  above  15  ppb  lead.    40  C.F.R. \n§ 141.80(c)(1). \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 9\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 9 \n \n  In  its  preliminary  injunction  decision,  the  district  court  claimed  that  two  ongoing \nviolations of the Safe Drinking Water Act justified relief:  (1) a lack of optimal corrosion control, \nand (2) a failure to monitor lead levels properly.   \nAbsence of evidence of an ongoing legal violation.  The first source of legal authority for \nthe injunction no longer exists.  When it issued the preliminary injunction, the district court \nthought that Flint water was above the action level for lead and thought that this measurement \namounted to a per se violation of the Act.  R. 96 at 8.  That is not the case.  Exceeding the EPA-\nset action level is not necessarily a violation of the Act.  See 40 C.F.R. § 141.81(b), (d).  To its \ncredit,  the  district  court  acknowledged  its  mistaken  belief  that  15  ppb  was  the  maximum \ncontaminant  level  for  lead  in  its  order  denying  a  stay.    56  Fed.  Reg.  at  26,477.    This \nconsideration in other words no longer justifies the order.  No less importantly, the most recent \nsampling data shows that “[i]t is likely” that Flint is now “meeting the lead action level.”  A.R. \n24 at 7. \nThe EPA’s monitoring requirement also cannot justify the injunction.  The regulations \nrequire testing every six months at pre-designated high-risk sampling sites until the results fall \nbelow the action level for two six month periods.  40 C.F.R. § 141.86(a), (d).  The district court \nthought the State was not in compliance with the monitoring requirements, possibly because \nVirginia Tech’s data included sample sites that were not high risk.  But the State has clarified the \npicture since then.  Although it collects data from a larger sampling pool for its own purposes, its \nsampling also includes 120 high-risk sites, more than the 60 required by the Lead and Copper \nRule for a city serving fewer than 1000,000 people and more than the 100 required for larger \ncities.  Id. § 141.86(c).  And the data from the high-risk sites suggests that the lead levels \ndropped below the action level even before the district court issued its order.  As long as the \nState separates this data from the broader sampling pool, which it has been doing and will \ncontinue to do, it has complied with the monitoring requirements.   \nOn this record, the State is in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the \nEPA’s regulations.  Until the plaintiffs can show an ongoing violation of these or other laws, the \ncourt has no basis for issuing injunctive relief.   \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 10\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 10 \n \nAbsence of tailoring in connecting the injunction to alleged violations.  Even if that were \nnot the case, the State still would prevail in all probability.  Let’s assume for the sake of \nargument that the legal premises of the district court’s decision had been correct—that the State \nwas still violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s corrosion control treatment and monitoring \nrequirements.  If so, that would have given the court authority to issue an order designed to \nremedy those violations.  Yet in ordering door-to-door water delivery and filter installation, it \nsaid not a word about monitoring or sampling methods.  A district court abuses its discretion \nwhere it fails to “fashion[] injunctive relief tailored to the identified harm.”  Northeast Ohio \nCoal. for Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 599 (6th Cir. 2012) (per curiam).  The preliminary \ninjunction was not “crafted . . . to the specific violations”:  the corrosion control shortcomings \nand the failure to sample high-risk sites.  Howe v. City of Akron, 801 F.3d 718, 753 (6th Cir. \n2015).  Before the district court “injected itself by injunctive decree” into these recovery efforts, \nit had a duty to ensure that its wide-ranging injunction would remedy ongoing violations of \nfederal laws.  Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 380 (1976). \nAbsence of proportionality in remedy.  There is one other problem with the order.  To \nillustrate this defect, let’s now assume two things:  that (1) the City and State are still violating \nthese  federal  laws  and  (2)  the  district  court  mentioned  these  violations  in  its  preliminary \ninjunction order.  Even then, it’s difficult to see how such a broad order could be upheld on \nappeal.  The door-to-door water delivery operation will cost at least $10.5 million per month, the \ncost of delivering bottled water to the 30,000 to 34,000 residences in Flint.  The State bears most \nof the costs for the delivery on the front end:  It must hire or train the large number of drivers \nneeded to drive the trucks around town; and it must find warehouse capacity for 11.3 million \nliters of water.  The logistical challenge of delivering water to every residence in Flint, not the \nact of purchasing water bottles alone, makes door-to-door delivery unreasonable on this record \nand indeed contrary to the best practices recommended by FEMA, an agency that knows a thing \nor two about emergency relief.  See R. 86 at 310. \nThese costs come on top of the hundred million dollars the State has already spent in \nresponse to the crisis and the many changes it has already made.  The government has set up \n9 points of distribution, one in each ward, in addition to supplying at least 42 faith-based groups \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 11\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 11 \n \nwith water, filters, and supplies for distribution.  The State and City have verified that 96% of \nhomes (some were unoccupied at the time) have water filters.  And any Flint resident can receive \nwater by dialing 211.  The functional needs program, operated out of a centralized warehouse \nthat is too small to accommodate the district court’s order, ensures that about 1,250 homebound \nhouseholds receive the water they need.  The preliminary injunction would essentially expand \nthe functional needs program to cover an additional 30,000 households—what amounts to a 24-\nfold increase in the size of the operation.   \nIn denying the State’s request for a stay of its decision, the district court thought these \ncosts were a mere “chimera,” R. 108 at 9, because 96% of Flint residents already have water \nfilters.  But the order requires weekly door-to-door water deliveries until the State and City \nensure that all of the water filters are working—all while the government spends $10.5 million a \nmonth to make the deliveries.  The preliminary injunction in other words forces the State to rely \non the filter exemption for mandated door-to-door delivery.  And to use the filter exemption, the \nState must “verify that a qualifying faucet water filter is installed and properly maintained.”  R. \n96 at 35.  Though the government has already verified that 96% of homes have filters, it must \nnow “inspect each filter to ensure the filter and cartridge have been maintained properly and are \nfunctioning.”  Id.  Even if Michigan spends $955,971 monthly to inspect every residence in Flint \n(and that’s just how much it would have to spend on State employees, operators, and vehicles), \nthe State will have to spend $10.5 million per month, or some roughly comparable amount, on \nthe door-to-door operation for the first several months until it can finish exempting residences.  It \ntook three months to visit every house in early 2016, even after Governor Snyder activated the \nNational Guard.  Left as is, the preliminary injunction is apt to bring recovery efforts to a dead \nstop as the State and City divert resources to comply with it. \nIn this context, I cannot understand two aspects of my colleagues’ position:  (1) that the \nState has an “erroneous belief that the central component of the injunctive relief is the door-to-\ndoor delivery of bottled water” and (2) that the State raises a “disingenuous claim” that the \ndelivery of bottled water will cost an estimated $10.5 million a month.  As to the first point, the \nmajority  later  in  its  opinion  accepts  the  State’s  straightforward  interpretation  of  the  order:  \n“Compliance with the order only requires that the State Defendants deliver bottled water to \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 12\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 12 \n \nhomes until they ensure that a home has a properly installed and maintained water filter.”  A lot \nis being asked of the word “only.”  But that word cannot change what the November 10 order \nrequires:  door-to-door water bottle delivery to the 30,000 to 34,000 homes in Flint until the State \nconfirms that the exemption applies.  Neither the plaintiffs nor the majority nor the district court \ndenies that it will take roughly $1 million and several months to determine which water filters \nwork and which do not.  Until then, the “central component” of the order will indeed be water \nbottle deliveries to each house.  As to the second point, the source of the State’s estimate is \nstraightforward.  There are 30,000 to 34,000 residences in Flint and a total population of around \n100,000.  The $10.5 million cost estimate per month turns on the estimated cost of delivering \nbottled water to that number of residences and the estimated number of individuals in each \nresidence.  That amount will of course diminish over time as the State confirms which filters \nwork and which need to be fixed.  But I cannot understand how the estimate is flawed as to the \ninitial requirement of the preliminary injunction or how costs will not run in the many millions of \ndollars for two to three months.  Notably, neither the plaintiffs nor the district court nor my \ncolleagues offer a cost estimate of their own.  I should have thought a prerequisite of any \npreliminary injunction imposed on a State or local government would be a finding by the court as \nto what it will cost. \nThe likelihood-of-success factor strongly weighs in favor of a stay. \n  Irreparable injury.  There is little room for debate that the preliminary injunction creates \none-and-done  injuries  to  the  State  and  City—an  estimated  $10.5  million  a  month  and \nredeployment of workers toward short-term water delivery and away from long-term solutions.  \nThese non-recoverable losses of money, time, and resources strongly favor a stay. \n  Injury  to  interested  parties.    What  matters  to  the  plaintiff  organizations  and  their \nmembers is that the State and City comply with federal law, reduce the amount of lead in Flint’s \nwater, improve sampling methods, and return the community to safe sources of drinking water.  \nThere are many reasons why the order does not serve these essential goals:  It is not connected to \nongoing violations of federal law; it does nothing to speed the gradual recoating of the pipes; it \ndoes nothing to improve monitoring; and above all its short-term focus on water deliveries will \ndivert resources, time, and money from fixing what Flint needs fixing most:  non-functioning or \n\n      Case: 16-2628     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/16/2016     Page: 13\nNo. 16-2628  Concerned Pastors, et al. v. Khouri, et al.  Page 13 \n \nimproperly installed water filters.  Notably, the record is barren of any proof of any instance in \nwhich any plaintiff (or any other organization) has identified a resident whom the State and City \nwill not provide with water or filters.  So too of residents with non-working filters:  The record \ncontains no evidence of anyone with such a filter who has asked for a repair and been denied.  \nOne caveat confirms the point:  The State and City cannot do anything about organizations, such \nas Crossing Water, who claim such people exist but who will not identify them.  This factor \nfavors a stay. \n  Public interest.  Because the State requests a stay, this inquiry merges into the other \nfactors,  with  concern  focused  on  how  the  district  court’s  order  will  affect  the  people  of \nMichigan.  Cf. Slyusar v. Holder, 740 F.3d 1068, 1074 (6th Cir. 2014).  An order unconnected to \nongoing violations of federal law that prioritizes the wrong remedies—at a cost of $10.5 million \na month—will do more harm than good for the community.   \n* * * \n  A dissent from an order upholding a district court’s decision, I recognize, is not a likely \nplace for a district court to look for advice.  But, by all appearances, this case could benefit from \na little more conversation between the parties and court.  Everyone has the same interests in \nmind:  delivery of safe water.  Do the plaintiffs really want the State’s and City’s limited \nresources focused on immediate door-to-door delivery now as opposed to using that measure as a \nlast resort if the defendants cannot ensure that the filters are working in, say, two or three \nmonths?  And if the district court identifies ongoing violations of federal law, would the State \nand  City  really  oppose  door-to-door  delivery  as  a  backstop  after  they  have  been  given  a \nreasonable amount of time to identify which filters work and which do not?  Reasonable people \ncan disagree about a lot of things, but I wonder if this is one of them. \n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n            ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT \n \n            Deborah S.

In that \nAgreement, the City of Flint and City Administrator (together, the City) committed \nto, among other things, replace thousands of lead service lines in Flint within three \nyears. The Agreement also requires the City to work with the State to ensure that \nFlint residents have access to safe tap water through properly installed and \nmaintained faucet filters. The City must document compliance with its obligations \nby providing periodic status reports to Plaintiffs and timely responding to \nPlaintiffs’ reasonable requests for other information relating to the Agreement’s \nimplementation. These information-sharing requirements are critical to ensuring \nthat Plaintiffs—and ultimately the Court—can hold the City accountable to its \ncommitments under the Agreement.  \nFor nine months, the City has consistently violated the Agreement’s \ndisclosure provisions. The City has repeatedly provided late, incomplete, and \ninaccurate status reports. See infra pp. 4-12. And it has routinely dragged its feet in \nresponding to Plaintiffs’ basic and concrete questions about how the City keeps \nrecords on its compliance and who maintains them. See infra pp. 4-13.  \nThese delays and inaccuracies have masked violations of the Agreement’s \n   1 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 10 of 32    Pg ID 7697\nother terms by making it more difficult and resource-intensive to identify those \nviolations and their causes. Plaintiffs cannot ensure that Flint residents receive the \nfull benefits of the Agreement, including protections designed to reduce exposure \nto lead in drinking water, if the City does not provide correct, timely, and complete \ninformation about its compliance efforts. \nIn view of the magnitude of judicial resources the Court has devoted to this \ncase, Plaintiffs do not seek additional relief lightly. Plaintiffs have attempted to \nresolve these issues with the City through countless letters, emails, and \nconferences, and repeated requests for the same information. But the City simply \nrefuses to comply with its disclosure obligations, which makes it impossible for \nPlaintiffs to monitor compliance with the rest of the Agreement. Plaintiffs \ntherefore respectfully request that the Court order the City to employ a more robust \nreporting and certification process, overseen by the Court, to address the systemic \ndeficiencies in its collection and disclosure of information under the Agreement. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.   The Court-ordered Settlement Agreement  \nOn March 28, 2017, the Court approved a Settlement Agreement resolving \nthis case. Order Approving Settlement Agmt. & Dismissing Case 2, ECF No. 152. \nIn doing so, the Court issued an order incorporating the Agreement in full, \nretaining jurisdiction to enforce it, and dismissing the case with prejudice. Id.  \n   2 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 11 of 32    Pg ID 7698\n   The Agreement provides short- and long-term relief to Flint residents to \nhelp address lead contamination in the City’s tap water. For long-term relief, the \nAgreement requires the City to conduct excavations to determine the service line \ncomposition at 18,000 Flint households, and to replace those service lines \nconfirmed to be lead or galvanized steel. Settlement Agmt. (Agmt.) ¶¶ 8-20, ECF \nNo. 147-1. To ensure that as many residents as possible participate in the service \nline replacement program, the City must track the addresses at which residents \nrefuse to grant the City permission to replace their service lines. Id. ¶ 16. This \nrecordkeeping requirement is important: if followed, it enables Plaintiffs to \nconduct outreach to residents who refuse service line replacement, to understand \nand ideally resolve any concerns the residents may have about removing their lead \nor galvanized steel service lines. See Chaudhary Decl. Ex. W at 1-2. \nThe Agreement also includes a faucet filter services program designed to \nprotect drinking water in the short term, while pipe replacements are ongoing. See \nAgmt. ¶¶ 38, 66-92. The State,1 through its Community Outreach and Resident \nEducation (CORE) program, must periodically visit homes in Flint through 2018 to \nprovide filter education, installation, and maintenance services. See id. To ensure \nthat CORE staff can promptly visit households with new residents, the Agreement \n                                                            \n1 Plaintiffs refer to State Defendants, the State of Michigan, and the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality collectively as “the State.”  \n   3 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 12 of 32    Pg ID 7699\nprovides that the City “shall notify CORE staff of any new Flint Water System \ncustomer within 30 days after activation of a new water account for the customer’s \nhousehold.” Id. ¶ 85. In addition, to protect residents from lead spikes that may \noccur immediately following service line replacement, Chaudhary Decl. Ex. I at 2, \nthe Agreement requires the City and State to make good-faith efforts to ensure \n“that each household has a properly installed Faucet Filter immediately after its \nservice line replacement is complete.” Agmt. ¶ 38.  \nThe Agreement further contains a series of disclosure requirements to allow \nthe parties to monitor compliance with its provisions. The City must provide status \nreports to Plaintiffs one month and two months after the Agreement becomes \neffective, and every three months thereafter. Id. ¶ 117. The status reports must \ninclude, among other information: (i) the total number of service lines replaced \nsince March 28, 2017; (ii) for each household at which a service line was replaced, \n“whether proper installation of a Faucet Filter after replacement was verified”; and \n(iii) the number and addresses of households at which the resident refused service \nline replacement. Id. ¶ 117.c.i-iii. The City must also provide “additional \ninformation, documents, or records related to implementation of th[e] Agreement” \nwithin fourteen days of a reasonable and specific request from Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 118.  \nII.   The City’s status reports and disclosures under Paragraphs 117 and 118  \n \nSince the Agreement went into effect, the City has established a pattern of \n   4 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 13 of 32    Pg ID 7700\nnonresponsiveness, delay, and noncompliance with the Agreement’s information-\nsharing provisions. The City has repeatedly failed to provide timely, complete, and \naccurate status reports. It routinely delays responding to Plaintiffs’ basic questions \nabout how it maintains records concerning its compliance, requiring Plaintiffs to \nask repeatedly—often over the course of months—for the same information. \nPlaintiffs’ attempts to work with the City to implement the Agreement have \nrevealed that the City is not undertaking adequate efforts to ensure that relevant \nCity staff both understand the Agreement’s obligations and track the information \nthey are required to report. As a result, Plaintiffs cannot know whether the City is \nadministering the Agreement’s pipe replacement program in a comprehensive and \nhealth-protective way.  \nPlaintiffs focus here on three examples of the City’s inadequate reporting \nand information-sharing to illustrate this systemic and recurring noncompliance: \n(A) verifying filter installations at Flint homes following service line replacements; \n(B) maintaining a list of addresses at which residents have refused to grant the City \npermission to replace their service lines; and (C) timely notifying CORE staff of \nnew water system customers so that CORE can promptly provide filter services. \nBut these are only a few instances of the City’s troubling approach to tracking and \nreporting information required by the Agreement. See, e.g., Chaudhary Decl. Exs. \nF at 3, J at 3, K at 2, L at 3; Tallman Decl. ¶ 3 (documenting the City’s five-month \n   5 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 14 of 32    Pg ID 7701\ndelay in posting a form on its webpage to allow residents to opt-in to the pipe \nreplacement program online and Plaintiffs’ repeated requests for information \ndocumenting compliance); Chaudhary Decl. Exs. F at 1, J at 2, K at 1, L at 2, M at \n1, R at 4-5 (detailing Plaintiffs’ repeated requests over months for documentation \nconcerning the City’s recordkeeping relating to its obligation to maintain a list of \nabandoned homes ineligible for pipe replacement); id. Exs. L at 3, P, R at 3, T-V \n(documenting the City’s more than two-month delay in responding to Plaintiffs’ \nrepeatedly asked basic question of whether the City or its contractors are tracking \nthe dates on which residents refuse pipe replacement). \nA.  Failure to report information verifying filter installations \nfollowing service line replacements  \n \nThe Agreement requires the City and State to work together to ensure that \nfaucet filters are installed “immediately” after pipe replacements are complete and \nto document compliance with this filter-verification requirement. Agmt. ¶¶ 38, \n117.c.ii.5.2 Although Plaintiffs raised this issue at least eight separate times in \nwriting over four months, Chaudhary Decl. Exs. B, D, E, F at 5-6, I, J at 3, L at 4, \nM, the City’s nonresponsiveness and incomplete reporting have prevented \nPlaintiffs from verifying whether this term of the Agreement is being fully \n                                                            \n2 Paragraph 117 imposes reporting obligations on Government Parties \ncollectively, giving the City and State flexibility to coordinate with each other to \ndetermine which party will report each piece of required information. Agmt. ¶ 117.\n \n   6 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 15 of 32    Pg ID 7702\nimplemented.    \nThe City’s first status report was both late and inaccurate. The City did not \nsubmit its report by the Agreement’s April 28, 2017 deadline, and it incorrectly \nreported that zero service lines had been replaced between March 28 and April 28, \n2017. Id. Exs. B, C. Plaintiffs subsequently notified the City that, based on visual \nobservations in Flint in mid-April, at least some service lines had been replaced \nduring the reporting period. Id. Ex. D. Plaintiffs asked the City to revise its report \nto accurately disclose information about pipe replacements during the reporting \nperiod, including whether the City or State had verified that a filter had been \nproperly installed at each household where a service line was replaced, as required \nunder the Agreement. Id. After the City did not respond within the two weeks \nprovided under the Agreement, Plaintiffs repeated their request that the City revise \nits status report to fix its inaccuracies. Id. Ex. F at 6.  \nPlaintiffs continued to pursue this issue because the City’s \nnonresponsiveness suggested it was not complying with the filter-installation \nrequirements in Paragraph 38. Agmt. ¶ 38. Indeed, at a May 18 meeting, the City \nindicated that officials were communicating with CORE staff approximately once \nevery two weeks about the addresses at which pipe replacements had occurred, \nChaudhary Decl. Ex. F at 5, meaning that homes could be unprotected from lead \nspikes that can occur immediately following pipe replacement. The day after that \n   7 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 16 of 32    Pg ID 7703\nmeeting, Plaintiffs sent a letter to both the City and State seeking additional \nclarification on when and how the City was coordinating with CORE. Id. Ex. E.      \nIt wasn’t until four weeks after Plaintiffs’ initial request for the service line \nreplacement and filter-verification data that the City provided a partial response \n(submitted with its next status report on May 30). Id. Ex. G at 1 n.1 (reporting the \nnumber of pipe replacements completed since March 28). However, the status \nreport was also incomplete, because it failed to include any information about \nwhether the City or State had verified that a filter had been properly installed at \neach of the nearly 400 homes where service lines had been replaced during the \nreporting period. Id. at 1 n.2. Despite being on notice for a month that this required \ninformation was missing from the City’s disclosures, the City’s report stated only \nthat, “[t]o the best of the City’[s] knowledge, the [Department of Environmental \nQuality] is tracking this data and dispatching CORE staff” to install the filters. Id.3   \nFollowing receipt of this report, Plaintiffs repeated their request that the City \nprovide information concerning verification of filter installations, and emphasized \nthe need to “coordinate” with the State to ensure that Government Parties report \n                                                            \n3 In contrast, the State’s status reports state that the City will report the filter-\nverification information required under Paragraph 117.c.ii.5. E.g., Chaudhary Decl. \nEx. A at 3. And, although the State wrote on May 26 that CORE staff were \nscheduling filter services visits “within 24 hours of the State receiving notice” that \na pipe replacement had been completed, the State did not confirm whether the City \nwas providing sufficient notice to CORE of pipe replacement completions to \nfacilitate “immediate” filter installation following replacement. See id. Ex. DD. \n   8 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 17 of 32    Pg ID 7704\nthe required information. Id. Exs. I, J at 3-4. On July 10, nearly two months after \nPlaintiffs requested the information, the City stated that “CORE has been given \naccess to the City’s [lead service line] replacement database and is able to conduct \nvisits to ensure that each household has a properly installed faucet filter.” Id. Ex. K \nat 2. The City did not include any data or records documenting whether the City or \nState had timely verified filter installations at the homes at which pipe \nreplacements had been completed.  \nPlaintiffs raised the issue of the City’s failure to report the required filter-\nverification data again on August 4, and yet again on August 23. See id. Exs. L at \n4, M. On August 28, three months after Plaintiffs first notified the City that this \nreporting information was missing, the City provided the filter-verification data \nwith its third status report. Id. Ex. N at 1 n.1 (noting attachment of data to status \nreport). However, the City’s next status report (submitted in December 2017) again \nfailed to contain the required information. See id. Ex. Z. The report stated again \nthat, “[t]o the best of the City’s knowledge, the [State] is tracking this data and \ndispatching CORE staff” to install filters. Id. at 1 n.1. To date, Plaintiffs still have \nnot been able to verify whether filter installations after pipe replacements are being \ntracked comprehensively in accordance with the terms of the Settlement.  \nB.  Failure to adequately maintain and disclose the Refusal List  \nPlaintiffs are also unable to confirm that the City is providing complete and \n   9 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 18 of 32    Pg ID 7705\naccurate information regarding residents that have refused to grant the City \npermission to replace their service lines. See Agmt. ¶ 117.c.iii. On May 18, the \nCity stated that it had not yet prepared a list of addresses at which residents had \nrefused pipe replacement (the Refusal List), as required under the Agreement. \nChaudhary Decl. Ex. F at 3; Agmt. ¶ 16. Although the Agreement had been in \nplace for nearly six weeks, the City did not yet have a plan for how it would \nsystematically collect refusal addresses and dates from its contractors and maintain \nan up-to-date list of such addresses. Tallman Decl. ¶ 2. On May 25, Plaintiffs \nrequested under Paragraph 118 that the City provide an update with documentation \ndemonstrating its compliance with this obligation. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. F at 3, 6. \nThe City did not respond within the fourteen-day deadline. Id. Ex. J at 1-2 & n.1. \nSix weeks after Plaintiffs’ request, the City responded with a single sentence: “The \nCity’s [lead service line] contractors have been asked to collect this information, \nand the City has received spreadsheets with this data from two of the City’s \ncontractors.” Id. Ex. K at 2. But the City has more than two contractors. \nBecause the City’s belated response did not indicate that the City was \nmaintaining a complete and up-to-date Refusal List, on August 4, Plaintiffs \nrequested that the City provide an “update documenting the City’s compliance” \nwith this obligation. Id. Ex. L at 3. After the City failed to respond within fourteen \ndays, on August 23, Plaintiffs initiated the Agreement’s dispute resolution \n   10 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 19 of 32    Pg ID 7706\nprocedures. Id. Ex. M. On September 13, four months after Plaintiffs initially \nraised this issue, the City reported that its contractors had been directed to provide \ninformation concerning the addresses at which residents had refused service line \nreplacement, but that “[c]onfirmation (and/or corrections, if any)” concerning the \ncompleteness and accuracy of information provided to date “has not yet been \nreceived.” Id. Ex. S at 2, see id. Ex. R at 3.    \nMoreover, the limited disclosures the City did provide during this \ncorrespondence were inaccurate. The City purported to provide the Refusal List \nwith its May status report; that list included 29 addresses at which residents had \nrefused service line replacement. (Fewer than 400 replacements were completed \nduring the reporting period.) Id. Exs. G, H. The City provided the same list of 29 \naddresses with its August status report, meaning that the City reported that no \nadditional residents had refused replacement during the preceding three months, \nnotwithstanding a large ramp-up in the pace of pipe replacements. (More than 3000 \nadditional pipe replacements were completed during the reporting period.) Id. Exs. \nN, O. These reports suggested inadequacies in the City’s recordkeeping.   \nPlaintiffs confirmed these inadequacies after they conducted outreach to the \nresidents on the City’s purported Refusal List. Id. Ex. W. Plaintiffs discovered that \nat least 13 of the 29 residents reported either that they had a copper service line, \nand thus were ineligible for pipe replacement, or that they had not declined service \n   11 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 20 of 32    Pg ID 7707\nline replacement. Id. Following discussions with the City, Plaintiffs learned that \nthe Refusal List the City provided with its prior status reports was inaccurate, and \nwas both under-inclusive (it excluded some homes at which residents had \naffirmatively refused pipe replacement) and over-inclusive (it included addresses \nwhere residents had not refused pipe replacement). Id. ¶¶ 26-27.  \nAfter months of negotiation, Plaintiffs finally obtained on December 6 what \nthe City claims is an updated copy of the Refusal List. Id. Ex. AA. But that list \nappears to have been last updated on October 26, nearly six weeks before the City \nprovided the list. Id. (column labeled “Date of Last Update”). Questions remain \nabout whether this latest Refusal List is complete and up to date, and whether the \nCity is complying with its obligation to “maintain records sufficient to comply \nwith the reporting and disclosure requirements under the Agreement.” Agmt. ¶ 36.    \nC.  Failure to timely provide information concerning Paragraph 85 \ncompliance  \n \nFor four months, the City ignored Plaintiffs’ requests for information \ndocumenting its compliance with the Agreement’s requirement to “notify CORE \nstaff of any new Flint Water System customer within 30 days after activation of a \nnew water account.” Agmt. ¶ 85. As of May 18, six weeks after the Agreement \nwent into effect, the City was not complying with this term, and was not tracking \nnew water accounts for purposes of complying with the Agreement. Chaudhary \nDecl. Ex. F at 5-6. On May 25, Plaintiffs asked the City to provide information \n   12 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 21 of 32    Pg ID 7708\ndocumenting its compliance with the requirement. Id. at 6. The City did not \nrespond to the request within fourteen days, by June 8. Id. Ex. J at 3-4. \nOn June 16, Plaintiffs repeated their information request. Id. The City did \nnot respond until July 10, more than six weeks after Plaintiffs’ initial request, and \nagain confirmed that it did not have a system to notify CORE staff of new water \naccounts. See id. Ex. K at 3 (stating the City is “confirming” to whom it should \nsend the new accounts list). Plaintiffs followed up on August 4 to again request the \nCity’s compliance with Paragraph 85 and documentation of that compliance. See \nid. Ex. L. The City did not respond within fourteen days. Id. Ex. M at 1. Plaintiffs \ndiscussed this issue with the City on September 6, and again repeated their request \nfor documentation by letter on September 8. Id. Ex. R at 2. Four months after \nPlaintiffs notified the City about this noncompliance, and after repeated delays in \nresponding to requests for updates, the City provided documentation showing its \ncorrespondence with CORE staff about new water accounts. Id. Ex. S.  \nAlthough the City has since documented its compliance with this \nrequirement, Plaintiffs had to follow up with the City more than five times over the \ncourse of months to resolve this issue. As the list of new accounts the City \ndisclosed in September shows, there were more than 600 new water customers \nbetween March 28 and July 6, 2017, the first time the City provided the list to \nCORE staff. Id. Ex. Q (see “TOTAL” at end of list). During the City’s months-\n   13 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 22 of 32    Pg ID 7709\nlong period of noncompliance, CORE teams may have been unable to promptly \nvisit residents at these addresses to ensure that they had properly installed filters.     \nIII.   Dispute resolution pursuant to the Agreement  \nOver the past nine months, Plaintiffs have initiated the Agreement’s dispute \nresolution process several times to raise and address concerns with the City’s \ncompliance with the Agreement’s disclosure and reporting requirements. Id. Exs. \nM, X. Most recently, on December 1, 2017, Plaintiffs sent the notice required \nunder Paragraph 128 describing disputes over the City’s violations of Paragraphs \n117 (status reports) and 118 (information requests). Id. Ex. Y. Plaintiffs proposed \nmodifications to the Agreement to improve information sharing among the parties \nand increase accountability for meeting the Agreement’s deadlines. Id. Ex. BB. \nThe parties then conferred by phone in a good-faith attempt to resolve the dispute, \nbut were unable to do so. Id. ¶¶ 32, 34.      \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Court’s order incorporating the Agreement is a consent decree. See \nPedreira v. Sunrise Children’s Servs., Inc., 802 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2015). The \nCourt both “expressly retained jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the \nsettlement’s terms” and “incorporat[ed] the settlement” into its dismissal order. Id.; \nOrder 2, ECF No. 152. As a consent decree, the order “operate[s] as an injunction,” \nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983), which “compels the \n   14 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 23 of 32    Pg ID 7710\napproving court to . . . protect the integrity of the decree with its contempt \npowers.” Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013, 1018 \n(6th Cir. 1994); see Waste Mgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 F.3d 1142, \n1146 (6th Cir. 1997) (courts “have a duty to enforce” their consent decrees). \nThe Court thus has the authority to remedy violations of the Agreement: \n“Federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for \ncompliance. Once entered, a consent decree may be enforced.” Frew ex rel. Frew \nv. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 440 (2004); see also Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. \n364, 370 (1966); Whitlock v. FSL Mgmt., LLC, 843 F.3d 1084, 1095 (6th Cir. \n2016). The court “has broad equitable remedial powers” when enforcing a consent \ndecree. Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 F.3d 523, 533 (6th Cir. 2012) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). It “may take such steps as are appropriate given the \nresistance of the noncompliant party,” Berger v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1569 (2d \nCir. 1985), including ordering “additional affirmative conduct” not required by the \nunderlying order, Roman v. Korson, 307 F. Supp. 2d 908, 919 (W.D. Mich. 2004).     \nARGUMENT \nI.  The City is violating the Settlement Agreement  \n \nThe City’s failure to submit timely, complete, and accurate status reports is a \nplain violation of Paragraph 117 of the Agreement. That section sets forth clear \ndeadlines for the City to submit its status reports as well as requirements for their \n   15 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 24 of 32    Pg ID 7711\ncontent. Agmt. ¶ 117. To date, all of the City’s status reports have been late, \nincomplete, inaccurate, or a combination thereof. See supra pp. 4-12. Only after \nPlaintiffs’ repeated prompting, phone calls, and correspondence has the City \nsometimes disclosed the required information, and even then the accuracy of the \ndisclosures has been questionable. See supra pp. 4-12.  \nThe City is similarly violating Paragraph 118. The examples described \nabove include more than ten violations of the City’s obligation to respond to \nrequests for information within fourteen days. The City is not exercising diligence \nin responding to Plaintiffs’ reasonable requests for information necessary to \nenforce the Agreement.  \nII.  The City’s violations frustrate implementation of the Agreement  \nThe City’s violations are not merely procedural or formalistic. They frustrate \nthe very purpose of the Agreement by impeding Plaintiffs’ ability to monitor and \nenforce its other terms. Without the disclosures required by the Agreement, \nPlaintiffs cannot verify that the City is replacing Flint’s service lines in a \ncomprehensive and health-protective way, or that it is adequately coordinating with \nthe CORE program to ensure all Flint residents have properly installed filters that \neffectively remove lead.   \nThe City, for example, must work with the State to confirm that filters are \ninstalled after each service line replacement. Agmt. ¶ 117.c.ii.5. Plaintiffs \n   16 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 25 of 32    Pg ID 7712\nrequested this disclosure to ensure residents are protected during the critical period \nimmediately after pipe replacement, when there is an elevated risk of exposure to \nlead in drinking water. Chaudhary Decl. Ex. CC at 14. The City’s repeated failure \nto report this information or to coordinate with the State on the status of the filter \ninstallations means that Plaintiffs do not know whether residents are being \nprotected from a serious health harm. See generally Lanphear Decl., ECF No. 27-9.  \nSimilarly, the City must include in its status reports the number and \naddresses of households that have refused pipe replacement. Agmt. ¶ 117.c.iii. The \npurpose of this provision is to track the health risk posed by the remaining lead and \ngalvanized steel service lines in Flint and to allow Plaintiffs to conduct community \noutreach to encourage more residents to allow the City to replace their pipes. After \nomitting the information from its first status report and ignoring repeated requests \nfrom Plaintiffs under both Paragraphs 117 and 118, the City finally reported—five \nmonths after the Agreement went into effect—that 29 residents had refused \nreplacement. See supra pp. 9-11. Plaintiffs then spent considerable time and \nresources contacting those residents, only to learn that the City’s disclosure was \nnot accurate and most of those residents should not be on the Refusal List. The \nCity did not even attempt to correct its mistake until Plaintiffs brought it to the \nCity’s attention. Supra pp. 11-12. Because of the City’s poor recordkeeping, for \neight months, Plaintiffs have been unable to reach out to residents to discuss their \n   17 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 26 of 32    Pg ID 7713\nrefusal to participate in the replacement program. These residents are not receiving \nthe benefits they are owed under the Agreement.  \nIn the same way, for months, the City ignored its obligation to notify CORE \nstaff at least monthly of new water system customers. Agmt. ¶ 85; see supra pp. \n12-13. Through in-person meetings, letters, calls, and emails, Plaintiffs repeatedly \nrequested that the City immediately comply with this obligation by sending a list of \nnew water accounts to CORE at least every 30 days. Providing each Flint resident \nwith filter installation and education services is critical to protect residents from \nlead exposure. See Op. & Order Granting Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 22-24, ECF \nNo. 96. Although the City ultimately began to comply with its obligation under \nParagraph 85, its lack of diligence resulted in a months-long violation of the \nAgreement. In the meantime, Plaintiffs could not confirm whether CORE and the \nCity were visiting the homes of new water customers within the timeframe set \nforth in the Agreement to verify that they had properly working filters.    \nThe City’s violations reflect a pattern of noncompliance. See supra pp. 4-13. \nEven if individual requests for information are ultimately resolved after months of \ncorrespondence and follow-up (as some of the examples discussed above were), \nthese repeated violations show systemic deficiencies in the City’s documentation \nand reporting and a disregard for important terms in this Court’s order.   \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ repeated attempts to address these issues, the City \n   18 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 27 of 32    Pg ID 7714\nrefuses to do more. It insists that the City’s counsel should not be obligated to \nundertake a reasonable inquiry to ensure the information received from City \ncontractors and employees is complete and accurate. Chaudhary Decl. ¶ 35. This is \nnot true. The Agreement’s disclosure requirements should come as no surprise: the \nCity negotiated these terms and agreed to provide this information. Cf. Ohio Valley \nEnvtl. Coal., Inc. v. Apogee Coal Co., 744 F. Supp. 2d 561, 570 (S.D.W. Va. 2010) \n(assuming defendant “entered into the Consent Decree in good faith with \nconfidence it could meet the deadline it was agreeing to”). In doing so, the City \nand its counsel also implicitly agreed to undertake reasonable diligence to verify \nthe accuracy of the information the City provides under this Court-ordered \nsettlement. See id. at 574 (finding that lack of diligence in efforts to comply with \nconsent decree and resultant violations warranted civil contempt).    \nIndeed, the City’s failure to provide basic information in a timely way raises \nlarger questions about its competency. If the City cannot collect critical, easily \nidentifiable data and provide it within the agreed-upon timeframes, how can \nPlaintiffs trust that the City is competent to execute the much larger and urgent \ntask of service line replacement in Flint? With every accumulated reporting \nviolation, it becomes more important that Plaintiffs verify whether the City is in \nfact meeting its obligations under the Agreement. The City’s lackadaisical \napproach to its reporting obligations contrasts sharply with the seriousness of the \n   19 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 28 of 32    Pg ID 7715\nissues at hand.   \nIII.  Further action by the Court is necessary to enforce the Agreement  \n \n  Plaintiffs seek targeted modifications to the Agreement to improve the \nCity’s diligence and timeliness in collecting and reporting information. See \nChaudhary Decl. Ex. BB. In view of the City’s limited financial resources, \nPlaintiffs do not seek relief such as contempt sanctions or civil penalties that may \nharm the City’s other functions. Plaintiffs instead request as a remedy a more \nextensive reporting and certification process, overseen by the Court, to ensure that \nthe City provides Plaintiffs with the information needed to make the Agreement \nwork as all the parties and the Court intended. \n  Plaintiffs seek this additional relief from the Court as a last resort. For \nmonths, Plaintiffs have attempted to work collaboratively with the City and avoid \nmotion practice through countless phone calls, conferences, and correspondence. \nSee supra pp. 4-14. But the City refuses to implement meaningful changes in its \ndata collection and reporting practices to meet its obligations under this Court’s \norder. Such violations warrant further relief: “A defendant who has obtained the \nbenefits of a consent decree—not the least of which is the termination of the \nlitigation—cannot then be permitted to ignore such affirmative obligations as were \nimposed by the decree.” Berger, 771 F.2d at 1568. Plaintiffs, accordingly, now \nseek the relief described below.   \n   20 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 29 of 32    Pg ID 7716\nStatus reports. Plaintiffs request that the Court order the City to complete a \nform titled, “City of Flint Status Report Certification Form,” and submit it to \nPlaintiffs with each required status report. See Chaudhary Decl. Ex. BB. This form \nobligates the City, for each of Paragraph 117’s disclosure requirements, to indicate \nwhether the required information was indeed reported to Plaintiffs, the date of the \ndisclosure, and the substance of the disclosure. If no such disclosure was made, the \nCity must explain why. Id. The City should also be required to file future status \nreports, including the certification forms, with the Court.  \nBoth the City and State oppose Plaintiffs’ request that the City file its status \nreports and certification forms with the Court. While Plaintiffs do not want to add \nto the Court’s administrative burden, the Agreement alone has not been sufficient \nto compel the City’s diligence and compliance. The submission of status reports to \ncourts is a well-established tool to “ensure sufficient public and judicial oversight” \nof the implementation of a consent decree. District of Columbia v. Potomac Elec. \nPower Co., 826 F. Supp. 2d 227, 239 (D.D.C. 2011). Increased transparency in the \nCity’s compliance reporting is a logical next step to improve accountability and \nprotect the integrity of the Court’s order. Cf. Putnam v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist., \n980 F. Supp. 1094, 1098 (N.D. Cal. 1997) (requiring reporting to the Court, instead \nof solely to plaintiffs, to remedy noncompliance with consent decree). \nRequests for information under Paragraph 118. Plaintiffs request that the \n   21 \n\n2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD    Doc # 155    Filed 12/27/17    Pg 30 of 32    Pg ID 7717\nCourt order the City to similarly certify its responses to requests for information \nunder Paragraph 118. Plaintiffs propose that, for each such request, Plaintiffs will \nfirst complete the relevant portions of a form titled, “Paragraph 118 Certification \nForm,” see Chaudhary Decl. Ex. BB. Within fourteen days of receiving such a \nform, the City would be required to return the completed form indicating whether \nit provided a full response to Plaintiffs and, if not, why not. Id. All such forms will \nbecome part of Paragraph 117’s disclosure requirements and be included in the \nstatus report materials filed by the City with the Court.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that the Court order the above-\ndescribed relief to enforce the Court-ordered Settlement Agreement. \nDated:   December 27, 2017         Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Dimple Chaudhary___________  /s/ Michael J.

But the Agreement does not end there. It spells out clear, specific steps the \nCity must take to protect public health while service lines are being replaced. In \nparticular, to protect against spikes in lead levels, the Agreement requires the City \nto ensure that faucet filters are properly installed immediately at each home where \na service line is replaced. The City must provide Plaintiffs with documentation \nproving it has done so.   \nThese measures are not suggestions. They were negotiated for and agreed to \nby all parties. They provide critical protections against further lead exposure in \nFlint. Without them, there is a risk that service line replacement could make things \nworse, not better, in the short term for some Flint residents.  \nDespite the importance of these terms, the City’s most recent status report \nshows that the City is failing to ensure filter installation. The City’s failures take \nthree forms. First, the City has consistently taken far too long to verify filter \ninstallation; though the Agreement calls for immediate verification, the City has \nroutinely taken weeks to contact households after service line replacements, with \nsome households waiting more than eight weeks before being contacted. Second, \n1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8495    Page 9 of 28\neven after Plaintiffs put the City on notice of these violations, the City still has not \nundertaken the required efforts to verify proper filter installation at dozens of \nhouseholds where pipe replacements occurred between April 1 and June 1, 2018. \nThird, the City has not maintained adequate records of filter verification, making it \nimpossible for Plaintiffs to ensure that the Agreement is being implemented \nproperly. \nThese failures are a serious breach of the Agreement. And they are only the \nmost recent examples of the City’s failure to comply. The City’s cavalier approach \nover the last sixteen months reveals either an unwillingness or an inability to fulfill \nits legal obligations under the Agreement and its duty to protect public health. \nRegardless, the City’s violations are jeopardizing the safeguards that Plaintiffs \nnegotiated on behalf of Flint’s residents.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order the City to immediately \ncomply with Paragraphs 38 and 117 of the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs further \nask the Court to require weekly status reports until the City demonstrates \ncompliance with the Agreement’s filter requirements. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nI.  The City’s filter verification obligations under the Settlement \nAgreement  \n \nIn March 2017, the parties, the State of Michigan, and the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality entered into a binding Settlement \n2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8496    Page 10 of 28\nAgreement resolving Plaintiffs’ claims under the Safe Drinking Water Act. See \nSettlement Agmt. (Agmt.), ECF No. 147-1. The Agreement requires the City to \nreplace thousands of lead and galvanized steel service lines at occupied homes in \nFlint by January 1, 2020. See id. ¶¶ 8-20. The Agreement also directs the City to \ntake additional steps at the time of service line replacement. See id. ¶¶ 34-38. \nAmong other requirements, the City must “make a good faith effort to ensure that \neach household has a properly installed Faucet Filter immediately after its service \nline replacement is complete.” Id. ¶ 38 (emphasis added). At a minimum, this \neffort “shall include three attempts to obtain access to a household to properly \ninstall a Faucet Filter.” Id.  \nParagraph 38’s filter verification requirements serve an important public \nhealth purpose. When lead pipes are disturbed, including during service line \nreplacement, there is a risk that lead can mobilize, causing significant short-term \nspikes of lead levels in drinking water. See, e.g., Tallman Decl. Exs. A at 1-2, 6, 7 \n(American Water Works Association, “Communicating About Lead Service \nLines”); B at x (American Water Works Association, “Replacement and Flushing \nof Lead Service Lines”) (describing lead service line replacement as “rais[ing] \nconcerns about elevated lead levels”); C at 2 (U.S. EPA, Science Advisory Board, \n“Drinking Water Committee Augmented for the Review of the Effectiveness of \nPartial Lead Service Line Replacements”) (explaining that service line replacement \n3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8497    Page 11 of 28\n“generally result[s] in elevated Pb levels for a variable period of time after \nreplacement”). These spikes can occur immediately after service line replacement, \nand can persist for weeks or months. See, e.g., id. Ex. A at 6, 7. Thus, though \nservice line replacement is an effective long-term strategy for reducing lead \ncontamination, it should be accompanied by immediate filter use to protect against \nshort-term lead exposure. See id.; cf. Dec. 27, 2017 Chaudhary Decl. Ex. I at 2, \nECF No. 155-2 (“Proper installation is critical to protect residents from spikes in \nlead release that can occur as a result of the physical disturbance of pipes during \nservice line replacement.”). \nThe Agreement includes reporting and disclosure provisions to ensure the \nCity’s compliance with its filter verification obligations. The City must regularly \nreport to Plaintiffs not only the number of households where service lines have \nbeen replaced, but also, for each household, whether proper installation of a filter \nhas been verified. Agmt. ¶ 117.c.i-ii. Such reports should include “any underlying \ndocumentation or records.” Id. ¶ 117. The City must also respond within 14 days to \nrequests by Plaintiffs for information on filter verification. Id. ¶ 118.    \nII.  The City’s May 25 status report and subsequent correspondence \nOn May 25, pursuant to Paragraph 117 of the Agreement, the City produced \na quarterly status report covering the period from February 15, 2018, to May 14, \n2018. See Tallman Decl. Ex. D. The report documented service line replacement at \n4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8498    Page 12 of 28\n61 households.1 Id. With the report, the City provided several spreadsheets with \ndata on each service line replacement. See id. Ex. E.  \nAccording to the “Filter Installation Tracking” tab of the City’s May dataset, \nthe City did not make any attempt to verify filter installations at any of the \nhouseholds at which replacements occurred until May 16, 2018, nine days before \nthe City’s status report was due. See id. On that date, the City attempted telephone \ncalls to 45 households where service lines had been replaced over the preceding \nfour weeks. Id. For seven households, the spreadsheet indicates only that the City \nhad no contact name or number; it shows no evidence of any effort to contact the \nresidents at these homes. Id. Ten households where service line replacements \noccurred between May 14 and May 18 are not even listed on the “Filter Installation \nTracking” tab. Id. \nOf the 45 households that the City attempted to contact to verify filter \ninstallation, the spreadsheet indicates that three refused filters. Id. Eleven \nhouseholds scheduled a date and time that they would be available for the City to \ndeliver a filter and verify installation; though all of these appointments preceded \n                                                           \n1 The status report stated that service line replacement had occurred at 52 \nhouseholds during the February 15–May 14 time period. Tallman Decl. Ex. D. \nHowever, the data provided by the City with its report documented an additional \nnine households at which service lines were replaced between May 15 and May 18. \nSee id. Ex. E at 3 (showing nine rows with pipe replacements dated May 16 or \nlater). \n \n5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8499    Page 13 of 28\nthe May 25 reporting date, the spreadsheet provides no indication of whether filter \nverification actually occurred. Id. For the other 31 households listed in the “Filter \nInstallation Tracking” tab, the City at most left a voicemail; the spreadsheet \nincludes no indication of any further attempt to contact these households. Id. Thus, \nas of May 25, the City had fulfilled its Paragraph 38 obligations for just three of \nthe 61 households that received new service lines between February 15 and May \n18—the three that refused further contact. The May 25 status report did not \ndocument a single household at which the City had actually verified proper filter \ninstallation. \nOn June 1, 2018, Plaintiffs notified the City that it was in violation of \nParagraphs 38 and 117 of the Settlement Agreement. See Tallman Decl. Ex. F. \nPlaintiffs stated that “the City is failing to ensure that residents have a properly \ninstalled faucet filter immediately after service line replacement.” Id. at 1. \nPlaintiffs pointed out that the violations were “part of an ongoing pattern of \nnoncompliance by the City.” Id. at 2-3.  \nOn June 14, 2018, the parties discussed by phone the City’s violations. See \nTallman Decl. ¶ 10. On June 22, the City provided a memorandum explaining “the \nCity’s efforts to verify filter installations . . . for those homes at which a service \nline was replaced between April 1 and June 1, 2018.” See id. Ex. G. Enclosed with \nthat memorandum was a table of 103 homes at which service lines were replaced \n6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8500    Page 14 of 28\nbetween April 1 and June 1 (“Table 1”), as well as a separate table documenting \nfilter verification efforts at these homes (“Table 2”). Id. The June 22 \ncorrespondence also included a third table, “Table 3,” documenting an additional \n21 households at which the City replaced service lines between April 1 and June 1 \nduring its next “phase” of service line replacement work. Id.  \n  The June 22 data documents the date of service line replacement, id. (tbl. 1, \ncolumn labeled “Date work performed”), and the date the City first sought to \nverify proper filter installation, id. (tbl. 2, column labeled “First Visit”). For over \nthree-quarters of the 103 households listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the June 22 data, \nmore than seven days passed between service line replacement and the first attempt \nat contact by the City; for several homes, the delay was more than 50 days. Fort \nDecl. ¶ 9; see Tallman Decl. Ex. G. For these 103 households, an average of 21 \ndays passed before the City first attempted contact. Fort Decl. ¶ 10; see Tallman \nDecl. Ex. G. \nAs of June 22, the City had not verified filter installation at 35 of the 103 \nhomes listed in Table 2. See Fort Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. A. These 35 households included \n23 households from the City’s May dataset, plus an additional 12 homes at which \nservice line replacement occurred between May 15 and June 1. See id. Ex. A. \n  On July 3, Plaintiffs sent a letter to the City asking it to remedy its ongoing \nnoncompliance with Paragraphs 38 and 117. See Tallman Decl. Ex. H. Plaintiffs \n7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8501    Page 15 of 28\nasked the City, within seven days, to provide documentation that it had met its \nobligations to verify filter installation at the 34 homes for which Table 2 showed \nnoncompliance.2 Plaintiffs also sought assurances that the City had put in place \noperating procedures that would ensure compliance moving forward. See id. Ex. H. \nOn a telephone call that same day, counsel for the City informed Plaintiffs’ counsel \nthat the City would not be able to provide a full response within the requested time \nperiod. See id. ¶ 11. As of the time of filing, Plaintiffs have received no further \nassurances from the City that it has conducted any additional filter verification \nefforts at these homes. \nFollowing Plaintiffs’ June 1 letter notifying the City of its violations, the \nCity produced a set of procedures that it represented will govern service line \nreplacements moving forward. Id. Exs. I, J. The procedures do not describe the \nspecific steps the City’s contractors will take to complete the required three \nattempts to verify filter installation, and do not provide a deadline for \naccomplishing these attempts. See id. Ex. I at 13. After additional inquiries from \nPlaintiffs, the City provided further correspondence concerning its plans, id. Ex. G \nat 1-2, but conceded that it still could not provide any information “regarding who \n                                                           \n2 Plaintiffs’ July 3 letter inadvertently omitted one household at which the City \nhas not made three good-faith attempts to verify filter installation. The correct \nnumber of households for which the City has not fulfilled its Paragraph 38 \nobligations is 35. See Fort Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. A. \n8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8502    Page 16 of 28\nexactly is responsible for second and third attempts, their scheduling, and their \ntimeframe.”  Id. Ex. K.         \nIII.  The City’s past noncompliance with its filter verification obligations   \n \nIn December 2017, following months of noncompliance by the City, \nPlaintiffs moved to enforce the Agreement’s reporting and disclosure provisions. \nSee Pls.’ Dec. 27 Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agmt., ECF No. 155. The violations \ndescribed in Plaintiffs’ motion included the City’s persistent failure to provide \ndocumentation concerning whether immediate filter verification was completed \nfollowing each service line replacement. Id. at 6-9. Plaintiffs had notified the City \nin writing of this noncompliance again and again—more than eight separate \ntimes—during the first year of the Agreement’s implementation. Id. at 6. \nNonetheless, by the time pipe replacements had stopped for the winter in late 2017, \nPlaintiffs had been unable to obtain information sufficient to assess whether each \nof the thousands of households at which service lines had been replaced were \nprotected from the risk of lead spikes immediately thereafter. Id. at 9. The limited \ninformation the City provided suggested that it was not coordinating with the State \nwith sufficient frequency to ensure immediate filter verification. Id. at 7-9.  \nPlaintiffs’ December 2017 motion to enforce remains pending with the \nCourt. See Stipulated Order on Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agmt. 1, ECF No. \n164. Pursuant to a Stipulated Order, the Court required the City to improve its \n9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8503    Page 17 of 28\nreporting and recordkeeping on filter verifications after service line replacements. \nFor all future status reports for the duration of the Agreement, the City must \nprovide, “in a reasonably usable format,” information showing, “for each address \nat which a service line was replaced: the date of service line replacement; the \ndate(s) and time(s) of any visit(s) from the City or its contractors to verify whether \na faucet filter was properly installed following service line replacement; and the \nresult of any such visit(s) (i.e., whether verification was successful).” Id. at 1-2.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Settlement Agreement operates as a consent decree. See Pedreira v. \nSunrise Children’s Servs., Inc., 802 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2015). “Federal courts \nare not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance.” Frew ex \nrel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 440 (2004). Rather, “[o]nce entered, a consent \ndecree may be enforced,” id., and this Court has “broad equitable remedial \npowers” to do so, Shy v. Navistar Int’l Corp., 701 F.3d 523, 533 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Agreement thus provides “a prospective \nform of relief involving continuous court oversight.” Whitlock v. FSL Mgmt., LLC, \n843 F.3d 1084, 1094 (6th Cir. 2016). \n10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8504    Page 18 of 28\nARGUMENT \nI.  The City is violating Paragraphs 38 and 117 of the Settlement \nAgreement and endangering public health \n \nA.  The City is delaying faucet filter verification, violating the \nAgreement’s requirement to act “immediately”  \n \nParagraph 38 of the Agreement requires the City to make a good-faith effort \nto ensure proper filter installation “immediately after” service line replacement. \nThere is an important reason for the Paragraph’s urgency: it protects Flint residents \nagainst the significant short-term spikes in lead levels that can occur after a service \nline is replaced. See Tallman Decl. Ex. A at 1-2, 6, 7. A filter verification that takes \nplace weeks or months after pipe replacement does not protect Flint residents from \nexposure to elevated lead levels that may have occurred in the interim.  \nThe City’s own documents show that it routinely delays for weeks, and even \nmonths, before attempting to verify proper filter installation. For the 103 \nhouseholds included in Tables 1 and 2, the City waited an average of 21 days after \nservice line replacement before visiting the home to verify proper filter installation. \nSee Fort Decl. ¶¶ 4, 10 & Ex. A. For 14 households, the City first attempted to visit \nthe home 35 days or more after service line replacement; in four instances, the first \nattempt took more than 50 days. Id. Ex. A. \n11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8505    Page 19 of 28\nIn Paragraph 38, as in everyday usage, “immediately” means immediately. \nThe City’s delay in attempting to verify filter installation at these households is a \nflagrant violation of the Settlement Agreement.  \nB.  The City still has not made the three required attempts to ensure \nfaucet filter verification at dozens of homes \n \nThe City has not only failed to comply with Paragraph 38’s urgent timeline; \nit has also failed to perform the actions required by that Paragraph. In signing the \nAgreement, the City committed to “make a good faith effort to ensure” that a filter \nwas properly installed at each household where a service line was replaced. Agmt. \n¶ 38. The Agreement is clear as to what that means: such an effort “shall include \nthree attempts to obtain access to a household.” Id.  \nBy the City’s own records, there are at least 35 homes where new service \nlines were installed between April 1 and June 1, but at which the City still has not \nmade three attempts to obtain access to the household to ensure proper filter \ninstallation. See Fort Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. A. Instead, City representatives conducted an \nunsuccessful first attempt, then never returned. For instance, pipe replacement \noccurred at Household 081 on May 16, 2018. See Tallman Decl. Ex. G tbl. 1, \nline 81. Nearly two weeks later, on May 29, the City made its first attempt to \naccess the home to verify proper filter installation. See id. tbl. 2, line 81. Though \nthe City did not verify that a filter was installed on that visit, as of June 22—well \nover a month after the service line had been replaced—no one from the City had \n12 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8506    Page 20 of 28\nmade a second attempt to contact the residents. See id. Tables 1 and 2 tell similar \nstories for dozens of other households. Compare, e.g., tbl. 1, line 81 (service line \nreplaced on May 16, 2018), with tbl. 2, line 81 (“First Visit” recorded as May 29, \n2018, no second or third visit recorded); tbl. 1, line 10 (service line replaced on \nMay 22), with tbl 2, line 10 (“First Visit” recorded as June 4; no second or third \nvisit recorded); tbl. 1, line 14 (service line replaced on April 26), with tbl. 2, line 14 \n(“First Visit” recorded as May 29; no second or third visit recorded).  \nAgain, the City’s continued failure to verify proper filter installation is not \nsimply a breach of the Agreement’s terms. It is a broken promise to the City’s \nresidents to protect against both long-term and short-term lead exposure. And it is \nnot a mere oversight. These violations have persisted even after Plaintiffs brought \nthem to the City’s attention and allowed ample time for the City to come into \ncompliance. Notably, Plaintiffs notified the City on June 1 that it had failed to \ncomplete a good-faith effort to verify filter installation at the households included \nin the City’s May 25 status report. See Tallman Decl. Ex. F. On July 3, Plaintiffs \npresented the City with a list of households at which the City had not fulfilled its \nParagraph 38 obligations. See id. Ex. H. As that letter made clear, nearly two dozen \nof these homes were included in the City’s May dataset and mentioned in \nPlaintiffs’ June 1 Notice of Violation. Id. at 1-2. Plaintiffs asked the City to \n“immediately fulfill” its Paragraph 38 obligations at these homes. Id. at 2. \n13 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8507    Page 21 of 28\nNonetheless, as of the date of this filing, the City has not produced any evidence of \nfurther attempts to contact these households.  \nBy continuing service line replacements without providing the protections \nrequired by Paragraph 38, the City has manufactured an avoidable risk to human \nhealth. This failure to implement the Agreement’s public health protections, like \nthe unresponsiveness described in Plaintiffs’ prior motions to enforce, “raises \nlarger questions about [the City’s] competency.” Pls.’ Dec. 27 Mot. to Enforce \nSettlement Agmt. 19. \nC.  The City has failed to adequately document and report filter \nverification efforts \n \nIn addition to requiring the City to verify filter installation, the Agreement \nmandates that the City document “whether proper installation of a Faucet Filter \nafter replacement was verified,” and provide Plaintiffs with “any underlying \ndocumentation or records.” Agmt. ¶ 117.  \nThe City’s May 25 status report and subsequent correspondence reveal \ntroubling, persistent gaps and inconsistencies in the City’s tracking and reporting \nsystems. Most obviously, the May 25 and June 22 datasets are produced in entirely \ndifferent formats and capture different information, suggesting a lack of uniformity \nin data collection efforts and frustrating Plaintiffs’ attempts to track, on a \nhousehold-by-household basis, filter verification efforts. Compare Tallman Decl. \nEx. E with id. Ex. G. Beyond these problems, the information provided by the two \n14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8508    Page 22 of 28\ndatasets is incomplete or inconsistent. For instance, the May 25 status report \npurports to document all homes where service line replacement occurred between \nFebruary 15 and May 14, but the City’s June 22 documentation lists at least two \nadditional homes that do not appear in the May dataset as having received service \nline replacements in that time frame. See Fort Decl. ¶ 11.  For two households, the \nJune 22 data indicates that filter verification was “complete[d]” on a date for which \nno visit was recorded. See id. ¶ 15. For all 61 households that are included in both \nthe May 25 report and June 22 data, the June 22 table lists a date for service line \nreplacement that is one day later than the day recorded in the May 25 report. Id. \n¶ 12. And in many instances, the “[s]chedule date” for filter installation set out in \nthe May 25 status report differs from the “First Visit” date in the June 22 \nmemorandum. Compare, e.g., Tallman Decl. Ex. E (May dataset) at “Filter \nInstallation Tracking” tab, line 31 (showing scheduled date of filter installation for \nhousehold as May 17); with id. Ex. G (June 22 memorandum) at tbl. 2, line 22 \n(showing first visit for same household as May 30).  \nThese violations are serious, and part of a larger pattern of inadequate \nrecordkeeping and reporting by the City. See, e.g., Pls.’ Dec. 27 Mot. to Enforce \nSettlement Agmt. Inadequate, inconsistent, and confusing documentation makes it \nnearly impossible for Plaintiffs to verify that the City is complying with the \nAgreement and protecting public health.  \n15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8509    Page 23 of 28\nII.  The Court should order the City to comply with Paragraphs 38 and 117 \nand provide additional reporting  \n \nThis is Plaintiffs’ third motion to enforce to date. Plaintiffs’ first motion \ndetailed the City’s repeated failure “to provide timely, complete, and accurate \nstatus reports” and to respond to requests for information necessary to monitor \ncompliance. Pls.’ Dec. 27 Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agmt. 5. Plaintiffs’ second \nmotion detailed “the City’s refusal to conduct the required evaluation” necessary to \naccurately estimate the remaining number of lead and galvanized service lines in \nFlint. Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce Pars. 29 and 30 of Settlement Agmt. 3, ECF No. 166. \nAnd these motions do not reflect the full scope of the City’s noncompliance: \nPlaintiffs have sought relief from the Court only as a last resort. The briefs on these \nmotions document only a fraction of the phone calls, correspondence, and other \nefforts through which Plaintiffs have sought to bring the City into compliance with \nits obligations. See, e.g., Pls.’ Dec. 27 Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agmt. 20.  \nDespite the City’s pattern of noncompliance, Plaintiffs do not yet seek \ncontempt sanctions, civil penalties, or the appointment of a master or monitor to \noversee compliance. See, e.g., United States v. Apple Inc., 992 F. Supp. 2d 263, \n280 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), aff’d, 787 F.3d 131 (2d Cir. 2015) (concluding that “external \nmonitors have been found to be appropriate where consensual methods of \nimplementation of remedial orders are unreliable or where a party has proved \nresistant or intransigent to complying with the remedial purpose of the injunction \n16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8510    Page 24 of 28\nin question” (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the current situation cannot \nstand.  \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek the following relief to compel the City’s \nimmediate compliance with its filter verification obligations: \nSpecification of a timeline for the City’s compliance with Paragraphs 38 \nand 117. Plaintiffs request that the Court order the City to fulfill its commitments \nunder Paragraphs 38 and 117 of the Settlement Agreement by specifying deadlines \nthe City must meet for its first, second, and third attempts to verify filter \ninstallation after service line replacement. Specifically, Plaintiffs ask the Court to \norder the City to:  \n(1) Conduct a first attempt to verify faucet filter installation on the same day \na service line replacement is completed at a household (i.e., \n“immediately”).  \n(2) Conduct a second attempt, if necessary, within 24 hours of the first \nattempt.  \n(3) Conduct a third attempt, if necessary, within 24 hours of the second \nattempt, so that all three attempts are completed within three days of the \nservice line replacement.  \n(4) Document and report, at all service line replacement households, (a) the \ndate and time of the first attempt at filter verification; (b) the result of the \n17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8511    Page 25 of 28\nfirst attempt at filter verification; and, if applicable, (c) the date and time \nof the second attempt at filter verification; (d) the result of the second \nattempt at filter verification; (e) the date and time of the third attempt at \nfilter verification; and (f) the result of the third attempt at filter \nverification. This relief is consistent with the reporting required by this \nCourt’s March 27, 2018 Order. See ECF No. 164. \n(5) Conduct three in-person attempts to verify filter installation (in addition \nto any telephone outreach).  \nAdditional reporting on filter verification. In light of the City’s pattern of \nnoncompliance with Paragraphs 38 and 117’s filter verification requirements, \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to order a period of more frequent and detailed reporting by \nthe City on filter verification efforts. For the next three months, Plaintiffs ask the \nCourt to require the City to produce weekly status reports to Plaintiffs \ndocumenting all filter installation verification efforts that have occurred during the \nweekly reporting period. At the conclusion of three months, if the parties agree that \nthe City has adequately demonstrated compliance, the prior reporting schedule will \nresume. \nExpedited briefing and consolidated hearing. This Court has noticed a \nhearing on Plaintiffs’ prior motion to enforce, ECF No. 166, for August 1, 2018. \nPlaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to set a modified briefing schedule to allow \n18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 173   filed 07/13/18    PageID.8512    Page 26 of 28\nthis motion to be heard at the scheduled August 1 hearing. Such relief is \nappropriate given the serious public health concerns at issue. \nThat the City has purportedly begun implementing new procedures for filter \nverification, see supra pp. 8-9, does not obviate the need for this Court’s \nintervention. Those procedures do not reflect a clear, specific plan to comply with \nParagraph 38. Plaintiffs’ requested relief is necessary to protect public health, and \nwell within the “broad equitable remedial powers” of the Court to enforce the \nAgreement. Shy, 701 F.3d at 533 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the Court-ordered \nSettlement Agreement should be granted. \nDated:   July 13, 2018           Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Sarah C.

Honorable David M. Lawson \n \nNICK A. KHOURI, FREDERICK HEADEN, \nMICHAEL A. TOWNSEND, MICHAEL A.  \nFINNEY, JOEL FERGUSON, SYLVESTER  \nJONES, R. STEVEN BRANCH, and  \nCITY OF FLINT, \n \n      Defendants. \n__________________________________________/ \n \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nFOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND EXPENSES \n  On March 12, 2024, the Court found the City of Flint in civil contempt of court due to its \nrepeated failures to meet deadlines for various phases of the replacement and restoration operation \nprescribed by a settlement agreement to rid the City of lead service lines in its water delivery \nsystem.  Although the Court denied much of the relief requested in the plaintiffs’ motion for \ncontempt, it permitted the plaintiffs to recover, as a compensatory sanction, the attorney’s fees and \nexpenses associated with litigating the contempt motion.  The plaintiffs now seek an award of \n$62,367.56, representing $51,393.50 in attorney’s fees and $10,974.06 in costs and expenses.  The \nrequest is well-documented and represents an amount substantially below the plaintiffs’ actual \nentitlement.  None of the City’s arguments for a reduction of the award is persuasive.  The Court \nwill grant the motion. \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13423   Filed 06/27/24   Page 2 of 9\nI. \n  The Court issued an order on March 12, 2024 holding the City of Flint in civil contempt of \nthis Court’s orders that established extended deadlines for several aspects of its obligation to \ncomplete water service line replacement and restoration work that it promised to carry out when it \nentered into a Settlement Agreement on March 28, 2017.  The City had failed to finish its outreach \nobligation by its March 1, 2023 deadline, it failed to ascertain the scope of its remaining restoration \nwork by its May 1, 2023 deadline, and it failed to provide a compliant list of all the properties \nwhere it had completed visual restoration inspections.  Each of these tasks was detailed in the \nCourt’s February 24, 2023 enforcement order.  The Court, however, declined to hold Flint’s \nelected mayor in contempt.   \n  By the time of the contempt ruling, the City represented that it had completed most of the \ntasks for which it was called out by the plaintiffs, albeit belatedly.  Some, though, still were left \nundone.  Nonetheless, the Court determined that coercive sanctions were not useful, although \ncompensatory sanctions were appropriate.  See Elec. Workers Pension Tr. Fund of Loc. Union #58, \nIBEW v. Gary’s Elec. Serv. Co., 340 F.3d 373, 378-79 (6th Cir. 2003) (stating that a court may \nimpose coercive or compensatory sanctions as a civil contempt remedy) (citing United States v. \nUnited Mine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. 258, 303-04 (1947)); see also United States v. Work Wear \nCorp., 602 F.2d 110, 115 (6th Cir. 1979) (“Civil contempt is meant to be remedial and to benefit \nthe complainant either by coercing the defendant to comply with the Court’s order via a conditional \nfine or sentence or by compensating the complainant for any injury caused by the defendant’s \ndisobedience.”).  The Court, therefore, ordered that the plaintiffs could recover as a contempt \nsanction their attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses (including expert witness expenses) incurred in \nbringing their motion for contempt and the ensuing proceedings. The Court permitted the plaintiffs \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13424   Filed 06/27/24   Page 3 of 9\nto apply for that compensation by filing an appropriate motion with proper documentation of fees, \ncosts, and expenses.   \n  The plaintiffs filed their motion seeking attorney’s fees and expenses of $62,367.56: \n$51,393.50 in fees and $10,974.06 in expenses.  Cognizant of the City’s financial constraints, they \nrepresent that the request excludes more than three quarters of the total time they spent litigating \ncontempt motion.  In total, the plaintiffs seek compensation for 178.9 hours of work by three \nattorneys and a paralegal.  The plaintiffs attached to their motion detailed billing entries.  See ECF \nNo. 282-10, PageID.13296-322.  The fee portion of the request breaks down as follows: \n  Hours Spent  Hours Sought  Rate  Fee \nAttorney Melanie Calero   296.4  53.7  $300  $16,110 \nAttorney Adeline Rolnick  211.2  48.7  $325  $15,827.50 \nParalegal Nicole Vandal  83.5  34.4  $125  $4,300 \nAttorney Sarah Tallman  132.0  42.1  $360  $15,156 \nAttorney Michael Wall  30.6  0.0  $500  -- \nTOTAL  753.7  178.9    $51,393.50 \n \n  The plaintiffs state that they reduced their request in four ways.  First, they limited the \nrequest to the time spent by three attorneys (Calero, Rolnick, and Tallman) and a paralegal \n(Vandal) — excluding entirely the work of other members of the litigation team, including \nenvironmental  litigator  Michael  Wall,  the  plaintiffs’  local  counsel,  and  several  additional \nparalegals.  Second, counsel reviewed line-item entries to reduce or eliminate time claimed for 1) \ninternal strategy discussions and meetings, 2) meet-and-confer meetings with more than one \nattorney present, 3) editing work product and drafting correspondence, 4) consultation with an \nunnecessary aerial imagery expert, 5) and time spent traveling to the motion hearing.  Third, they \napplied a 40% reduction to Calero and Rolnick’s billing entries to account for work that could \nhave been done more quickly by more experienced attorneys.  Fourth, they applied an across-the-\n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13425   Filed 06/27/24   Page 4 of 9\nboard 30% reduction to account for their unsuccessful argument that Flint’s Mayor should be held \nin contempt and in light of the City’s financial position.    \n  The plaintiffs also seek $10,974.06 in costs and expenses, which include the fees for expert \nwitness Noah Attal and counsel’s travel costs for the contempt hearing.  Again, the plaintiffs \nattached to their motion detailed time entries for their expert, disclosing that he worked for 102.65 \nhours at a $55 hourly rate.  ECF No. 282-10, PageID.13324-25.  And again, they limited their \nexpense submissions by excluding costs for food and taxis.  ECF No. 282, PageID.13188.   \n  The City argues that the plaintiffs’ fee request should be reduced substantially for two \nreasons.  First, it suggests that the plaintiffs did not achieve a high degree of success in the \ncontempt proceedings because the Court did not grant all the relief the plaintiffs sought.  Second, \nit maintains that the Court should not award the plaintiffs’ expenses for their travel to Michigan \nfor the contempt hearing because the plaintiffs would not agree to hold the hearing virtually.   \nII. \n  Although the fee award in this instance represents a compensatory remedy for civil \ncontempt and does not result from the operation of a fee-shifting statute, the amount of the award \nnonetheless must be “reasonable.”  Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 831 F.3d 686, 702 \n(6th Cir. 2016).  “An award of attorney’s fees and expense is among the ‘appropriate’ equitable \nremedies for a successful moving party ‘in a civil contempt proceeding.’”  Cernelle v. Graminex, \nL.L.C., 539 F. Supp. 3d 728, 738 (E.D. Mich. 2021) (quoting TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 \nF.2d 1261, 1273 (6th Cir. 1983)), aff’d, No. 21-1579, 2022 WL 2759867 (6th Cir. July 14, 2022); \nsee also McMahan & Co. v. Po Folks, Inc., 206 F.3d 627, 634 (6th Cir. 2000) (“[A]n award of \nattorney’s fees is appropriate for civil contempt in situations where court orders have been \nviolated.”) (citing Redken Lab., Inc. v. Levin, 843 F.2d 226 (6th Cir. 1988)).    \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13426   Filed 06/27/24   Page 5 of 9\n  The reasonableness of a fee award generally is measured by the lodestar method.  Husted, \n831 F.3d at 702.  That method calls for multiplying “the number of hours reasonably expended on \nthe litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Ibid. (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. \n424, 433 (1983)).   \n  Measured against the amount of work necessary to litigate fully the motion for contempt, \nthe plaintiffs’ request for fees, if anything, is substantially less than the amount they are entitled to \nreceive.   The first step of computing the lodestar is to examine the “the number of hours reasonably \nexpended on the litigation.”  Ibid.  The plaintiffs attached to their motion detailed line-item billing \nentries, describing 753.7 hours of work spanning the period from the entry of the Court’s fifth \nenforcement order in February 2023 to their supplemental submissions on the contempt motion in \nNovember.  See Ex. 3, ECF No. 282-10, PageID.13296-322.  Notably, the plaintiffs only seek \ncompensation for 178.9 of those hours and for fewer of the personnel than participated in the \ncontempt proceeding.  This figure is reasonable: the plaintiffs undertook substantial efforts to \nmonitor the City’s progress, consult with an expert witness to identify the deficiencies in its \nreporting, and litigate their motion for contempt through a contested hearing and in post-hearing \nbriefing.  As one example of the character of this work, the record of proceedings from the \nplaintiffs’ motion for contempt to the present filings is nearly 2,000 pages in length.   \n  The plaintiffs likely would have been entitled to claim additional time because the rationale \nfor some of the reduction in hours overlaps with the so-called Johnson factors courts may use to \nmodify a lodestar award, see Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 \n(5th Cir. 1974) (noting that courts should consider, among other things, the skill required to \nperform the legal service and the experience of an attorney), and the Court’s determination of the \nreasonable hourly rate for the attorneys, which accounts — to an extent — for an attorney’s level \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13427   Filed 06/27/24   Page 6 of 9\nof experience.  Of the hours sought by the plaintiffs, however, the City does not point to any \ninappropriate billing entries, and the Court did not locate any in its review of the records.  The \ntime sought by attorneys Calero (53.7 hours), Rolnick (48.7 hours), Tallman (42.1 hours), and \nparalegal Vandal (34.4 hours) is appropriate.   \n  Besides the hours requested, the billing rates for each attorney also are well-supported and \nare in line with the rates charged by local environmental law practitioners.  The plaintiffs seek \n$300 per hour for Calero, an attorney with four years of experience, $325 for Rolnick, an attorney \nwith five years of experience, and $360 for Tallman, an attorney with eleven years of experience.  \nECF No. 282, PageID.13178.  According to the State Bar of Michigan’s 2023 Economics of Law \nSurvey Results Summary Report, these rates all are below the $413 median rate hourly charged by \nMichigan attorneys specializing in environmental law.  See 2023 Economics of Law Survey \nResults,  State  Bar  of  Michigan,  8  (2023),  https://www.michbar.org/file/pmrc/pdfs/-\n2_2023EOL_SurveyResults.pdf.  And the rates are between the median and 75th percentile range \nfor all attorneys with similar years of legal experience.  Id. at 6.  The plaintiffs also attached to \ntheir motion declarations from two local practitioners who confirm that the requested rates are at \nor below Detroit-based market rates for environmental litigators with similar skills and experience \nlevels.  See Decl. of Nathan Dupes, ¶¶ 11, ECF No. 282-3, PageID.13196-97; Decl. of Mark \nGranzotto, ¶¶ 17-22, ECF No. 282-4, PageID.13201-03.  The requested $125 hourly rate for \nparalegal Nicole Vandal also is in line with Detroit market rates and is reasonable.  See Dupes \ndecl. ¶ 13; see also Krueger v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., No. 19-10581, 2024 WL 497105, at *4 \n(E.D. Mich. Feb. 8, 2024) (awarding $125 per hour for paralegal work); Aljahmi v. Ability \nRecovery Servs., LLC, No. 17-13772, 2022 WL 891416, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 25, 2022) (noting \nthat courts in this district have awarded between $125 and $160 per hour for paralegal work).   \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13428   Filed 06/27/24   Page 7 of 9\n  The City argues that the amount of the fee award proposed by the plaintiffs is excessive \nbecause the plaintiffs did not achieve a high degree of success in their contempt motion and that \nthe award should be adjusted accordingly.  This argument is misplaced.  Although a plaintiff’s \ndegree of success sometimes matters when a court evaluates a fee request, see Hensley, 461 U.S. \nat 434 (noting that a court, reviewing a lodestar, should ask whether the “plaintiff achieve[d] a \nlevel of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee \naward”), it is less appropriate in a civil contempt action where the goal of a sanction is to \n“compensate the complainant for losses sustained,” Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. \nBagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 834 (1994) (quoting Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 303-04); Alter Domus, \nLLC v. Winget, No. 08-13845, 2024 WL 1307812, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 27, 2024) (“[T]he \npurpose of the attorney’s fee allowance here . . . is not based on any fee-shifting provision but \nrather is for compensation resulting from [the defendant’s] contempt.”).   \n  All considered, though, the plaintiffs achieved a high degree of success in the contempt \nmotion.  Finding a municipality in contempt is unfortunate, but it is no small achievement.  \nAlthough the Court did not adopt the plaintiffs’ requested sanctions, the Court agreed that the \nCity’s violations of the Settlement Agreement amounted to contempt of court and opened the door \nfor equitable relief.  Concerned Pastors for Soc. Action v. Khouri, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2024 WL \n1076245, at *13 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 12, 2024).  The Court therefore assessed attorney’s fees “to \ncompensate the plaintiffs for the cost of bringing the instant action.”  Ibid.  Moreover, the \nplaintiffs’ fee request already accounts for the City’s “lack of success” contention because the \nplaintiffs reduced their request by 30% across-the-board to adjust for unsuccessful arguments \nraised in their motion.  The City is not entitled to any further reduction on this basis.   \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13429   Filed 06/27/24   Page 8 of 9\n  The City’s second argument is less persuasive than its first.  It contends that it should not \nbe required to pay the plaintiffs’ expenses incurred for travel to the contempt hearing because the \nplaintiffs declined its request to hold the hearing virtually.  However, holding an in-person hearing \nversus a remote hearing was not the plaintiffs’ decision to make.  Even if the plaintiffs consented \nto conduct the hearing virtually, the Court would have denied the request.  The plaintiffs’ travel \ncosts therefore were unavoidable and are properly compensable as part of the contempt sanction.  \nSee Cernelle, 539 F. Supp. 3d at 744 (“The Court has discretion to order recovery of meal and \ntravel expenses.”).  The City does not point to any inappropriate expenses associated with the \nplaintiffs’ travel to Michigan, and a review of the relevant records suggests that the plaintiffs \nconducted an economical trip.  See Expenses, ECF No. 282-10, PageID.13327. \n  Finally, the City suggests its resources could be better spent completing service line \nexcavations, replacements, and restorations than paying the plaintiffs’ fees, which may be true.  \nBut it is beside the point.  Of course, the City should be directing its resources to its remediation \nefforts, but the Court found that the City’s contempt entitled the plaintiffs to a remedy.  The \nsanction — although not punitive — serves an important signaling function, forcing the City to \nuphold its commitment to the plaintiffs as outlined in the Settlement Agreement and to recognize \nthe Court’s authority.  The City cannot complain that the Court imposed unrealistic obligations.  \nThe missed deadlines occasioning the finding of contempt were the City’s fault.  Compare \nStipulation, ECF No. 256 with Order Granting Fifth Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, \nECF No. 258.  It never sought leave to adjust these dates and only belatedly complied after the \nplaintiffs instituted contempt proceedings.  The City is a large enterprise and maintains taxing \nauthority.  It can bear this sanction and provide relief to the property-owners who have waited on \nits compliance for far too long.   \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 288, PageID.13430   Filed 06/27/24   Page 9 of 9\n  More fundamentally, it is inaccurate to frame the sanction so narrowly as a diversion of \nresources from the City’s ongoing remediation efforts.  The plaintiffs are owed some credit for \nspurring the City to fulfill its obligations; they are not merely a drain on its resources.  Without \ntheir persistent efforts, particularly in the recent contempt proceedings, the remediation still could \nbe languishing.  Their work has benefitted Flint residents, and they already have accounted for the \nCity’s fiscal realities by submitting a pared back fee request.   \nIII. \n  The plaintiffs’ attorney’s fee and expense request is reasonable and warranted as an \nappropriate contempt sanction. \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ motion for attorney’s fees, costs, and \nexpenses (ECF No. 282) is GRANTED.   \n  It is further ORDERED that the City of Flint shall pay to the plaintiffs forthwith the sum \nof $62,367.56.   \n    s/David M.

The basic goal of that agreement was to \neffectuate the replacement of the lead and galvanized service lines that supplied drinking water to \na multitude of residential and commercial properties in the City.  The Settlement Agreement, \nwhich resolved the complaint filed in this case under the Clear Water Act, outlined the several \ntasks necessary to achieve the ultimate goal, such as identifying the offending infrastructure, \ncontacting residents and obtaining consent to work on their properties, excavating and replacing \nthe service lines, and restoring the property surfaces to their original condition.  Deadlines and \nreporting and record-keeping requirements were put in place to monitor and ensure the timely \ncompletion of the work.  The State of Michigan, some of whose officials were named as defendants \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13432   Filed 06/29/24   Page 2 of 7\nin the case, agreed to fund the project up to $97 million.  The City was responsible for doing the \nactual work.   \n     Under the original Settlement Agreement terms, the service line replacement work was to \nbe completed by March 28, 2020.  That deadline, together with corresponding inspection and \nreporting deadlines, were modified several times.  The City has made considerable, if untimely, \nprogress  toward  remediating  the  31,578  properties  identified  in  the  Settlement  Agreement.  \nHowever, in a motion now before the Court to suspend some of those enlarged deadlines, the State \ndefendants represent that approximately 1,901 residences still require restoration.  The parties have \nnot agreed on how many properties still require service line replacement under the Settlement \nAgreement’s terms.  They estimate that approximately $1.1-1.2 million of the funds committed by \nthe State remain.  At an estimated cost of $2,500 per restoration, City officials surmise that \ncompleting the remaining work will cost approximately $4,754,000, with additional expenses for \nproject management likely to add to that figure.  It does not appear that the City would have the \nfunds or the wherewithal to satisfy its obligations under the Settlement Agreement unless help \nfrom outside is found.   \n  Fortunately for the residents of Flint, the State has agreed to provide a lifeline and a way \nforward.  In its motion to stay temporarily some of the City’s reporting obligations — which none \nof the parties oppose — the State has offered to assume responsibility for managing the remaining \nwork and provide the additional funds required.  The State is not suggesting that the Settlement \nAgreement  be  modified  further  to  add  requirements  that  would  bind  the  State  defendants.  \nHowever, at the hearing on the motion on June 25, 2024, the State’s attorney assured the Court \nthat the present administration is committed to seeing this project through to completion.   \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13433   Filed 06/29/24   Page 3 of 7\n  The relief requested by the State parties is slightly vague: they ask the Court to stay \ntemporarily “any work and weekly, monthly, and quarterly reporting obligations that Flint has \nunder the Settlement Agreement (as amended), as well as any orders issued by this Court, solely \nas to restorations.”  ECF No. 286, PageID.13403.  This request apparently does not extend to the \nCity’s obligation to submit the notice, statement, and documents, outlined in Paragraph 7 of the \nCourt’s April 2022 Order, which requires the City to notify the settling parties with 14 days of its \ndetermination that it has completed all required service line replacements and restorations.  See \nibid.; April 2022 Order, ECF No. 237, PageID.11075.  The State defendants add that the parties \nhave agreed that “a goal” of August 1, 2025 is an appropriate target for completing the remaining \nwork, or at least giving an estimate for when that may occur.   \n  Although neither the City nor the plaintiffs oppose the State parties’ request for a stay, the \nplaintiffs’ approval is contingent on the State’s agreement to provide bimonthly reporting on the \nrestoration efforts.  This reporting would include:  \na. An Excel spreadsheet listing all addresses where contractors have completed \nrestoration, including, for each address: (i) the date(s) of restoration; (ii) whether \nthe  completed  work  was  soft-surface  and/or  hard-surface  (i.e.,  asphalt  and/or \nconcrete)  restoration;  and  (iii)  whether  additional  restoration  work  remains \nrequired; and \nb. the total amount of monies paid by State Parties for work required under the \nAgreement  relating  to  excavations,  replacements,  property  restoration,  and/or \nprogram management. This reporting will also include any reimbursements to the \nCity of Flint described in Paragraph 117.c.iv of ECF No. 147-1. \nECF No. 286, PageID.13400-01.  The plaintiffs also ask the State to require its contractor continue \nto conduct the visual inspection, photo documentation, and door hanger efforts, summarized in the \nCourt’s February 24, 2023 order, and to make documentation available upon request.  Finally, the \nplaintiffs ask that the State inform the parties within 14 days of the time it believes it has completed \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13434   Filed 06/29/24   Page 4 of 7\nthe restoration work, that it provide documentation of that contention, and that the parties use a \nmeet-and-confer process to resolve disputes.  The State parties agree to these requests.   \n  Although there may be a dispute over the number of properties where service lines need to \nbe replaced, all parties agree that the bulk of the remaining work involves the City’s obligation to \nrestore properties disturbed by an excavation.  The State parties ask the Court to “stay any work \nand  the  City’s  weekly,  monthly,  and  quarterly  reporting  obligations  under  the  Settlement \nAgreement, or the Court’s Orders, solely as to restorations.”  ECF No. 286, PageID.13399.  This \nCourt’s past orders regarding restoration indicate that the defendants presently are required to \nreport: \n-  Monthly, a list of excavated addresses where the City has a record of a completed \nrestoration, a list of excavated addresses where records indicate restoration is still required, \nand a list of excavated addresses for which the City has no contemporaneous record of \nrestoration and whether a visual inspection had been conducted of that property.  Feb. 2023 \nOrder, ECF No. 258, PageID.11695.   \n \n-  Monthly, any emails or calls received by the City during the reporting period from residents \nconcerning visual inspections.  Id. at PageID.11696.   \n \n-  Monthly, the total funding approved for payment for site restoration work based on weekly \ncontractor  reports  and  invoice  processing.    March  2019  Order,  ECF  No.  208, \nPageID.10348.   \n \n-  Bi-weekly, updates to the plaintiffs regarding when weather conditions occur that would \npermit it to resume excavation, replacement, or restoration work after the winter season.  \nFeb. 2023 Order, ECF No. 258, PageID.11689.   \n \n-  Within three days of re-bidding contracts for remaining restoration work, the date it \nexecutes each contract.  April 2022 Order, ECF No. 237, PageID.11074. \n \nThe Court is not aware of any ongoing weekly or quarterly reporting obligations related to \nrestoration.   \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13435   Filed 06/29/24   Page 5 of 7\n  As the Court has explained several times in previous orders, a settlement agreement in \nessence is a contract.  Cogent Sols. Grp., LLC v. Hyalogic, LLC, 712 F.3d 305, 309 (6th Cir. 2013).  \nWhen enforcing a contract, the first objective is to “honor the intent of the parties,” Rasheed v. \nChrysler Corp., 445 Mich. 109, 127 n.28, 517 N.W.2d 19, 29 n.28 (1994), and the prime source \nof that intent is the plain language of the agreement, Wilkie v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 469 Mich. \n41, 61, 664 N.W.2d 776, 787 (2003) (“Well-settled principles of contract interpretation require \none to first look to a contract's plain language.”).  Nonetheless, the Settlement Agreement entered \nby the parties operates as a consent decree — that is, a “settlement agreement subject to continued \njudicial policing.”  Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013, 1017 (6th Cir. \n1994) (quoting Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983)).  A consent decree is “a \nstrange hybrid in the law,” Lorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., 979 F.2d 1141, 1148 (6th Cir. \n1992) (quoting Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir. 1981)), in that it is “at once ‘a voluntary \nsettlement agreement which could be fully effective without judicial intervention’ and ‘a final \njudicial order . . . plac[ing] the power and prestige of the court behind the compromise struck by \nthe parties,’” ibid. (quoting Williams, 720 F.2d at 920).  Consent decrees therefore “may be ‘treated \nas contracts for some purposes but not for others.’” Ibid. (quoting United States v. ITT Cont’l \nBaking, 420 U.S. 223, 236 n.10 (1975)).   \n  A court’s power to enforce a consent decree includes the “inherent equitable power to \nmodify  a  consent  decree  if  satisfied  that  the  decree  ‘has  been  turned  through  changing \ncircumstances into an instrument of wrong.’” Waste Mgmt. of Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 \nF.3d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Knote, 29 F.3d 1297, 1302 (8th Cir. \n1994)).  The authority to modify such a decree includes the power to suspend its operation.   \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13436   Filed 06/29/24   Page 6 of 7\n  The parties here all agree that some of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement should \nbe suspended, but those conditions would be temporary and focused on achieving the overarching \npurpose of the settlement that the parties intended.  The State’s request for a stay appears calculated \nto allow it greater freedom to assist the City in completing its outstanding restoration work.  The \nparties all consent to a stay, provided the State makes certain reports discussed above.  The relief \nrequested in the motion will advance the better interests of the parties and will be allowed. \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion by the State defendants to stay temporarily \ncertain of the City of Flint’s restoration obligations under the Settlement Agreement, as modified \n(ECF No.  286) is GRANTED IN PART.   \n  It is further ORDERED that: \n  1.  Any obligation that the City has under the settlement agreement or subsequent \norders of this Court to conduct and provide weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports on restoration \nwork is stayed until August 1, 2025. \n  2.  The State defendants shall submit to the Court on a quarterly basis until August 1, \n2025 a report on the status of their efforts to complete excavations, replacements, and restorations \nrequired under the Settlement Agreement. \n  3.  The City of Flint, in consultation with the State defendants, shall submit to the \nCourt and the plaintiffs, on or before July 10, 2024, a list of all properties that still have lead or \ngalvanized water service lines, itemized by those properties that are subject to remediation under \nthe Settlement Agreement and those properties known still to have lead service lines but are not \nsubject to remediation under the Settlement Agreement.  By that date, the City also shall comply \nwith the final excavation and replacement reporting requirements required by the Order Modifying \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-10277-DML-SDD   ECF No. 289, PageID.13437   Filed 06/29/24   Page 7 of 7\nSettlement Agreement, see ECF No. 237, PageID.11071-73, and the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ \nFifth Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, see ECF No. 258, PageID.11686-87. \n  4.  The parties shall submit a report to the Court on or before July 1, 2025 on the \nstatus of the State parties’ efforts, and if the excavations, replacement, and restoration work \nrequired under the settlement agreement has not been completed by that date, whether the parties \nhave been able to agree on a plan to complete that work. \n  5.  The parties are not required at this time to submit supplementals briefs as required \nby this Court’s February 24, 2023 Order.  See ECF No. 258, PageID.11688. \n  6.  Beginning on July 15, 2024, and on the first and fifteenth day of each month \nthereafter under August 1, 2025, the State defendants shall provide to the plaintiffs:   \na. An Excel spreadsheet listing all addresses where contractors have completed \nrestoration, including, for each address: (i) the date(s) of restoration; (ii) whether \nthe  completed  work  was  soft-surface  and/or  hard-surface  (i.e.,  asphalt  and/or \nconcrete)  restoration;  and  (iii)  whether  additional  restoration  work  remains \nrequired; and \nb. the total amount of monies paid by State Parties for work required under the \nAgreement  relating  to  excavations,  replacements,  property  restoration,  and/or \nprogram management. This reporting will also include any reimbursements to the \nCity of Flint described in Paragraph 117.c.iv of ECF No. 147-1. \n  7.  The State defendants shall require their contractor to continue to conduct the visual \ninspection, photo documentation, and door hanger efforts, summarized in the Court’s February 24, \n2023 order, and to make documentation available on request.   \n  It is further ORDERED that the City of Flint shall complete all remaining work required \nby the Settlement Agreement on or before August 1, 2025.   \n    s/David M.

The water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink. It has not been \nsafe to drink since April 2014, when city and state officials began using the \nFlint River as a source of drinking water and caused lead to leach into the \ncity’s water supply.  \n2.  This case is about the government’s failure to comply with the \nfederal law that requires cities to deliver safe drinking water to the public. \nThe Safe Drinking Water Act directs officials who operate water systems to \ntest drinking water for harmful contaminants and to treat the water to \ncontrol for those contaminants. City and state officials’ complete disregard \nfor those requirements is exposing the people of Flint to lead, a powerful \ntoxin that is devastating to the human body. \n3.  Flint was once a prosperous city with a strong economy built \naround the automotive industry. But the closing and relocation of \nautomotive plants over the past thirty years hurt the city’s economy and \ntax base, contributing to a shrinking population and resulting in increased \nunemployment, poverty, and crime. Flint is now a struggling city. More \nthan forty percent of Flint residents live below the poverty level, and more \n1 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 3 of 58    Pg ID 3\nthan a quarter of its working-age residents are unemployed.  \n4.  In November 2011, in response to Flint’s budget deficit and \nmounting debt, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial \nemergency in the city. He stripped local elected officials of all of their \nauthority and installed a state-appointed Emergency Manager to take over \nand run the city’s operations. The Emergency Manager was not removable \nby Flint voters or otherwise accountable to the Flint electorate.  \n5.  To save the city money, the Emergency Manager and other \nstate officials decided to switch the city’s drinking water source from Lake \nHuron to the Flint River. The Flint River has long been known to residents \nas a contaminated dumping ground for nearby industries. In making this \nswitch, city and state officials sent Flint River water flowing into the \nhomes, schools, and churches in Flint without following federal \nrequirements for treating and testing drinking water for lead.  \n6.  These decisions have endangered the health of Flint’s residents. \nWhen run through the city’s aging metallic pipes, the corrosive Flint River \nwater ate away at those pipes, causing lead to leach into drinking water. \nThe people of Flint have been exposed and are still being exposed to high \nlevels of lead in their water. In the past two years, the percentage of Flint \n2 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 4 of 58    Pg ID 4\nchildren with elevated levels of lead in their blood has doubled and in \nsome areas has nearly tripled. \n7.  Flint residents began raising concerns about the safety of their \ndrinking water nearly two years ago. Government officials dismissed their \nconcerns and insisted that the water was safe to drink. State officials even \ndisregarded researchers’ findings that the water contained dangerously \nhigh levels of lead. Not until a national spotlight was focused on Flint did \ncity and state officials belatedly acknowledge a problem.  \n8.  Despite this far-too-late acknowledgement, the problems in \nFlint have not been fixed. Public trust has been eroded by government \nofficials’ efforts to evade responsibility in this crisis. The damage done to \ncity pipes from the Flint River water means that lead will continue to \ncontaminate Flint’s drinking water. This contamination poses an ongoing \nhealth risk to the city’s residents, especially young children, who are most \nvulnerable to the effects of lead.  \n9.  The harms suffered by Flint residents will not be addressed \nuntil city and state officials properly treat Flint’s water to control lead, \nproperly test the water for lead contamination, promptly notify residents of \ntesting results, and report their activities to state regulators, all as required \n3 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 5 of 58    Pg ID 5\nby the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n10.  Plaintiffs are individuals and citizens’ groups whose members \nlive in homes served by Flint’s water system. They bring this suit as \ncitizens to ensure that the water provided to their homes will no longer \nthreaten their health, and to address the medical and health harms they \nhave suffered.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action \npursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a), and the \nfederal-question jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The Court may \naward Plaintiffs all necessary injunctive relief pursuant to the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a), (e), and declaratory relief \npursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.   \n12.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims occurred in this judicial district, in Flint, Michigan.  \n13.  Plaintiffs have provided Defendants, the Administrator of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Michigan Attorney \nGeneral with at least sixty days’ written notice of the violations of law \n4 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 6 of 58    Pg ID 6\nalleged here in the form and manner required by the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(b); 40 C.F.R. §§ 135.11-.13. A copy of Plaintiffs’ \nNovember 16, 2015 notice letter is attached as Exhibit A to this Complaint. \nTHE PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiffs consist of organizational plaintiffs Concerned Pastors \nfor Social Action (Concerned Pastors), American Civil Liberties Union of \nMichigan (ACLU-MI), and Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. \n(NRDC), and individual plaintiff Melissa Mays.  \n15.  Concerned Pastors is a nonprofit association of religious leaders \nand congregations from more than thirty predominantly African American \nchurches and ministries in the City of Flint (City) and its surrounding \ncommunities. The association was founded nearly fifty years ago to protect \nthe rights of the underserved and improve the lives of the people of Flint. \nConcerned Pastors has been organizing and advocating for safe drinking \nwater in Flint for nearly two years. Its efforts include holding public rallies \nand meetings, liaising with state and local elected officials, and distributing \nthousands of cases of bottled water and water filters to community \nmembers. Concerned Pastors is committed to protecting the health of \nFlint’s children and families from the City’s contaminated drinking water. \n5 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 7 of 58    Pg ID 7\nConcerned Pastors is organized under the laws of Michigan and has an \noffice address of 2200 Forest Hill, Flint, Michigan 48504.  \n16.  Plaintiff ACLU-MI is a nonprofit organization founded in 1959. \nACLU-MI’s mission is to protect the freedoms and rights of all Michigan \ncitizens. Through public education, advocacy, organizing, and litigation, \nACLU-MI works to guarantee the benefits of our nation’s laws to everyone. \nACLU-MI played a significant role in investigating the water problems in \nFlint while the City was under emergency management and exposing the \nlead contamination in its drinking water. ACLU-MI has approximately \n9,000 members, more than ninety-five of whom live in Flint. ACLU-MI is \nincorporated under the laws of Michigan and has an office address of 2966 \nWoodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48201. \n17.  Plaintiff NRDC is an international, nonprofit environmental \norganization. NRDC engages in research, advocacy, and litigation to \nprotect public health and reduce the exposure of all communities to toxic \nsubstances. NRDC’s work includes advocacy aimed at ensuring that all \nAmericans have access to safe and affordable drinking water that is free \nfrom dangerous contaminants. Founded in 1970, NRDC has more than \n294,000 members nationwide, including more than 8,600 members who \n6 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 8 of 58    Pg ID 8\nreside in Michigan, eighty of whom live in Flint. NRDC is incorporated \nunder the laws of New York and is headquartered at 40 West 20th Street, \nNew York, New York 10011. \n18.  Concerned Pastors, ACLU-MI, and NRDC bring this action on \nbehalf of their members. Members of these organizations are residents of \nFlint whose homes are served by the City’s water system (Water System). \nThese members and their families live, work, recreate, attend church, and \ngo to school in buildings that receive Flint’s water.  \n19.  Members of Concerned Pastors, ACLU-MI, and NRDC living in \nFlint are harmed, and will continue to be harmed, by Defendants’ \nviolations of the Safe Drinking Water Act unless this Court grants the \nrequested relief. These members are harmed, and will continue to be \nharmed, because they have an increased risk of exposure to elevated levels \nof lead in their drinking water.  \n20.  High levels of lead have been found in drinking water in homes \nand schools throughout Flint. Members of Concerned Pastors, ACLU-MI, \nand NRDC are reasonably fearful of exposure to lead from their drinking \nwater. They are concerned about their health and the health of their \nchildren, including potential long-term developmental problems.  \n7 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 9 of 58    Pg ID 9\n21.  Because of these members’ reasonable concerns about lead \nexposure, they use bottled water and/or install water filters in their homes \nto minimize their risk. Members of these organizations would prefer to use \nunfiltered tap water that they purchase from the Water System, rather than \nhaving to incur additional costs and inconvenience to use bottled water \nand/or install water filters. These filters, if not used, changed, and \nmaintained regularly and properly, can stop working or even make lead \nproblems worse. Members also have visited and will continue to visit \ndoctors to have their blood tested for lead.  \n22.  Members of Concerned Pastors, ACLU-MI, and NRDC are \nharmed by these and other actions they are taking to protect themselves \nand their families from Flint’s water. Their injuries will be redressed by an \norder requiring Defendants to monitor and control for lead in Flint’s \ndrinking water in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and to \ncomply with the Act’s reporting and notification requirements. Such an \norder will enable members to make informed decisions about whether their \ntap water is safe to drink and will remediate the dangerous conditions and \nhealth risks that the members continue to be exposed to as a result of \nDefendants’ continued noncompliance.  \n8 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 10 of 58    Pg ID 10\n23.  Plaintiff Melissa Mays and her husband live in Flint with their \nthree sons, ages eleven, twelve, and seventeen. From when she moved to \nFlint in 2002 until September 2014, Ms. Mays and her family used tap water \nsupplied by the Water System for drinking and cooking. In September \n2014, after the City issued a temporary advisory instructing all residents to \nboil their drinking water, Ms. Mays and her family stopped drinking Flint’s \nwater. In January 2015, Ms. Mays and her family stopped cooking with the \nCity’s water.   \n24.  Ms. Mays is concerned about her health and the health of her \nfamily. She is harmed because she and her family have an increased risk of \nexposure to elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. She is \nreasonably fearful that she and her family have been exposed and will \ncontinue to be exposed to lead if they drink and cook with Flint’s water. \nShe is harmed, and will continue to be harmed, by Defendants’ violations \nof the Safe Drinking Water Act, unless this Court grants the requested \nrelief.  \n25.  Ms. Mays’ concerns have caused her to stop using Flint’s water \nfor drinking and cooking, to minimize her risk of exposure to lead. \nAlthough Ms. Mays would use her home’s tap water if it were safe to \n9 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 11 of 58    Pg ID 11\ndrink, Ms. Mays’ reasonable fears about lead in her tap water have forced \nher to purchase water filters and bottled water for herself and her family \nand to visit doctors routinely to monitor her family’s health. Ms. Mays has \nbeen forced to take these actions, including incurring considerable costs \nand inconvenience, to protect herself and her family from lead in Flint’s \ndrinking water.  \n26.  Ms. Mays’ injuries will be redressed by an order requiring \nDefendants to monitor and control for lead in Flint’s drinking water and \nreport information in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n27.  Defendant Nick A. Khouri is sued in his official capacity as \nSecretary of Treasury of the State of Michigan. He oversees and manages \nthe City’s operations while the City remains under state control. Pursuant \nto his authority under the Michigan Local Financial Stability and Choice \nAct, see Mich. Comp. Laws § 141.1561(2), Defendant Khouri must approve \namendments to the City budget, including amendments resulting from \nlarge contracts the City enters. He or his designee must also sit on the Flint \nReceivership Transition Advisory Board (Board), a group of state-\nappointed officials presently monitoring the City. Id. §§ 141.1552(3), \n.1563(2). Defendant Khouri is an operator of the Water System within the \n10 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 12 of 58    Pg ID 12\nmeaning of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  \n28.  Defendant Frederick Headen is sued in his official capacity as \nChairperson of the Board, and Defendants Michael A. Townsend, David \nMcGhee, Michael A. Finney, and Beverly Walker-Griffea are sued in their \nofficial capacities as Members of the Board. The Board directs the City’s \naffairs alongside city officials. The Board must approve certain contracts \nand all resolutions, ordinances, and budget amendments adopted by the \nCity Council before they can take effect, including those concerning the \noperations of the Water System. Defendants Headen, Townsend, McGhee, \nFinney, and Walker-Griffea are operators of the Water System within the \nmeaning of the Safe Drinking Water Act.   \n29.  Defendant Natasha Henderson is sued in her official capacity as \nthe City Administrator of Flint. She directs and supervises the day-to-day \noperations of the City, including the operations of the Water System. Flint’s \nEmergency Manager appointed Defendant Henderson to her position. \nDefendant Henderson is an operator of the Water System within the \nmeaning of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  \n30.  Defendant City of Flint is the owner and an operator of a \n“public water system” as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act. 42 U.S.C. \n11 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 13 of 58    Pg ID 13\n§ 300f(4); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2. A public water system is a system that provides \ndrinking water through pipes to at least twenty-five people, and includes \nwater collection, treatment, storage, and distribution facilities. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300f(4); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2. As an owner and operator of a public water \nsystem, the City is also a “supplier of water.” 42 U.S.C. § 300f(5); 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.2. The Water System is a large public water system for purposes of \nthe Act. 40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  \nFACTS \nHarmful effects of lead \n31.  Lead can harm nearly all of the body’s functions and organs, \nand is particularly damaging to the nervous system.   \n32.  Young children are especially vulnerable to lead. Lead \nexposure in children can cause a wide array of problems, but is most \nharmful to a child’s developing brain. Even low levels of lead exposure \nduring childhood can result in lower intelligence, poorer academic \nperformance, developmental delays, attention deficits, impulsivity, and \nother behavioral problems. Some of these effects appear to be irreversible.  \n33.  Lead can pass from a pregnant woman to her developing baby, \nwhich can cause the baby to be born premature or underweight, and can \n12 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 14 of 58    Pg ID 14\nharm the baby’s brain. Lead can also pass from nursing mothers to their \nbabies through breastmilk.   \n34.  Exposure to lead also harms adults, including by causing nerve \ndisorders, decreased kidney function, reproductive problems, and \ngastrointestinal damage. Adults exposed to lead may also suffer from \nmuscle and joint pain, memory and concentration problems, and high \nblood pressure.   \n35.  Lead is uniquely harmful because, after it enters the \nbloodstream, it is distributed throughout the body just like iron and \ncalcium. It settles in bones, where it interferes with the production of blood \ncells and the absorption of calcium. Calcium is necessary for muscle and \nnerve function, and for bone growth in children. Lead may remain stored \nin bones for years, from where it can be reabsorbed into blood during times \nof physiological change, including stress, pregnancy, lactation, broken \nbones, and advanced age.  \n36.  People can be exposed to lead by breathing air containing lead \nparticles or by ingesting water, food, or dust contaminated with lead.   \n37.  Children and adults who have been exposed to lead may not \nimmediately show symptoms. The effects of exposure often do not appear \n13 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 15 of 58    Pg ID 15\nfor years, even long after measures of lead levels in blood have returned to \nnormal.  \n38.  There is no safe level of lead in blood. \nLead in drinking water \n39.  Water sources vary in terms of their chemical properties. When \nwater displays certain characteristics including an acidic pH, it is \nconsidered corrosive.  \n40.  Corrosive water dissolves metals from metallic pipes at a high \nrate. This can cause lead contained in pipes and the solder joining pipes to \nleach into drinking water in significant amounts. See 56 Fed. Reg. 26,460, \n26,463, 26,466 (June 7, 1991). This leaching can continue indefinitely. Id. at \n26,466.  \n41.  The amount of lead that leaches into drinking water depends \nheavily on the corrosivity of the source water. Id.  \n42.  Over the past several decades, drinking water has become a \nmore significant source of lead exposure, as regulation has reduced the risk \nof lead exposure from other sources such as lead paint and leaded gasoline. \nInfants who rely on formula may receive more than eighty-five percent of \ntheir exposure to lead from drinking water. Id. at 26,470.   \n14 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 16 of 58    Pg ID 16\n43.  There is no safe level of lead in drinking water.  \nThe Safe Drinking Water Act’s approach to controlling lead in \ndrinking water \n \n44.  The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. § 300 et seq., is \nthe federal law that protects Americans from harmful contaminants in their \ndrinking water. \n45.  To achieve this goal, the Act requires owners and operators of \npublic water systems to test their water for specified contaminants, treat \nthe water to control for those contaminants, and provide certain reports \nand notices to customers and regulators. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1; 40 \nC.F.R. §§ 141.22-.26, .31, .61-.66, .151, .201. Each of these steps is essential to \nreducing lead levels in tap water and informing the public about the health \nrisks posed by their drinking water. See 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(1)(A).    \n46.  The Act also requires public water systems to control for lead. \nThe requirements for controlling lead in drinking water are set forth in \nregulations issued under the Act known as the Lead and Copper Rule (the \nRule). 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80-.91. \n47.  EPA is charged with issuing regulations to implement the Safe \nDrinking Water Act and enforcing the Act’s requirements if states fail to do \n15 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 17 of 58    Pg ID 17\nso. 42 U.S.C. § 300g-2. Almost every state, including Michigan, has been \ndelegated primary responsibility for ensuring that public water systems \ncomply with the Act’s requirements. The Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ) is responsible for enforcing the Safe \nDrinking Water Act in Michigan. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 325.1003. \nCorrosion control \n48.  EPA promulgated the Lead and Copper Rule in 1991. See 56 \nFed. Reg. at 26,460. The Rule requires public water systems to treat \ndrinking water to control the leaching of lead from pipes and solder. See 40 \nC.F.R. § 141.80(b), (d).  \n49.  The Rule directed all large public water systems to identify and \nimplement an “optimal” treatment program to reduce corrosion of lead \npipes and solder by January 1, 1997. Id. § 141.81(d)(4). “[O]ptimal corrosion \ncontrol treatment” is defined as the treatment that minimizes lead \nconcentrations in consumers’ tap water. Id. § 141.2. It often involves adding \nchemicals to the water to reduce its corrosivity and control its effect on \nleaded pipes and solder. \n50.  Certain treatment chemicals, such as phosphates, inhibit \ncorrosion. They work by forming a protective coating inside of water pipes. \n16 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 18 of 58    Pg ID 18\nThis protective coating develops over many years. The coating helps slow \nthe corrosion of leaded pipes and solder, reducing the amount of lead that \nleaches into drinking water. When highly corrosive water that is not \ntreated with an inhibitor flows through leaded water pipes, this protective \ncoating is destroyed, increasing the amount of lead that enters into \ndrinking water. Corrosive water can irreversibly damage water pipes.   \n51.  Once a water system has optimized its corrosion control \ntreatment program, it is required by the Rule to “continue to operate and \nmaintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 40 C.F.R. § 141.82(g). \nTap water monitoring \n52.  The Rule also requires water systems to conduct periodic \nmonitoring for lead in household tap water. Id. § 141.86. Monitoring for \nlead at consumers’ taps is necessary to measure lead levels in drinking \nwater. This is because lead can enter the water after it leaves the water \nsystem’s treatment plant, as it travels through pipes towards consumers’ \nhomes.    \n53.  The Rule’s tap water monitoring requirements are designed to \ntest for lead under worst-case conditions, including by testing at homes \nthat are most at risk for elevated lead levels. Homes are at high risk if they \n17 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 19 of 58    Pg ID 19\ncontain lead plumbing or if they are served by lead service lines. 56 \nFed. Reg. at 26,514; see 40 C.F.R. § 141.86(a). Service lines are pipes that \nconnect household plumbing to the main water distribution pipe in the \nstreet. In older water distribution systems, such as the system in Flint, these \nservice lines often are made of lead. \n54.  Monitoring at high-risk homes is critical to ensuring that \nelevated lead levels in drinking water are detected, because lead is not \ndistributed uniformly throughout a water system. 56 Fed. Reg. at 26,514. \nInstead, lead pieces may break away from a lead service line and travel into \na customer’s home without dissolving and spreading evenly throughout \nthe water in the distribution system. These lead pieces result in intermittent \nbut large spikes in the water’s lead levels. Even a single sample showing \nelevated levels of lead indicates that these dangerous lead pieces may be \npresent more widely in the system.  \n55.  Targeting high-risk homes thus makes it more likely that a \nwater system will detect whether lead is breaking off or leaching from the \nWater System’s pipes or solder. Such targeting also helps water systems \nand regulators determine whether a system has minimized lead levels in \ndrinking water by operating an optimized corrosion control treatment \n18 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 20 of 58    Pg ID 20\nprogram. Id.    \n56.  The Rule requires public water systems serving more than \n100,000 people to collect a set of at least 100 tap water samples twice each \nyear. 40 C.F.R. § 141.86(c), (d)(1). Water systems serving between 10,001 \nand 100,000 people must collect at least sixty tap water samples twice each \nyear. Id. A water system has six months to collect each set of tap water \nsamples. Id.  \n57.  Each time a water system completes a six-month monitoring \nperiod, it must calculate whether more than ten percent of the samples \ncollected have a lead concentration greater than 15 parts per billion (ppb). \nSee id. §§ 141.80(c), .90(a)(1)(iv). EPA found that lead levels of 15 ppb or less \nwere representative of effective corrosion control treatment. 56 Fed. Reg. at \n26,490. EPA concluded that when more than ten percent of tap water \nsamples collected by a water system exceed this 15 ppb threshold, known \nas the “lead action level,” additional treatment of drinking water would be \n“appropriate to protect public health.” Id. at 26,491.  \n58.  If more than ten percent of samples collected during a \nmonitoring period have a lead concentration in excess of the lead action \nlevel (15 ppb), the water system must take additional steps to protect its \n19 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 21 of 58    Pg ID 21\ncustomers from lead exposure. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.84(a), .85-.86; 56 Fed. Reg. \nat 26,478. These steps include identifying and reporting to the state the \nnumber of lead service lines in the water system, 40 C.F.R. § 141.90(e); \nreplacing a portion of the system’s infrastructure with pipes and solder \nthat are “lead free” as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act, id. § 141.84; \nconducting additional monitoring of the system’s source water to \ndetermine whether additional treatment is needed, id. §§ 141.83, .88(b); and \nconducting additional tap water monitoring, id. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B).  \n59.  As part of these additional steps, water systems must also offer \nto sample the tap water of any customer who requests it, id. § 141.85(c), and \neducate the public about the risks of lead and ways consumers can reduce \ntheir exposure to lead in drinking water, id. § 141.85(b).    \n60.  A water system may reduce the number of tap water samples it \ncollects and the frequency of its monitoring if it meets certain criteria for \ntwo consecutive monitoring periods. First, less than ten percent of tap \nwater samples collected during each monitoring period may exceed the \nlead action level. Id. § 141.86(d)(4)(ii). Second, the water system must show \nthat it is maintaining optimal corrosion control treatment. It can show this \nby maintaining prescribed values for certain water-quality indicators, \n20 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 22 of 58    Pg ID 22\nincluding pH and other measures of the water’s corrosivity. Id.; see id. \n§ 141.82(f).  \n61.  If each of these conditions is met for two consecutive \nmonitoring periods, a state may allow the water system to reduce its \nmonitoring frequency to once per year, and may reduce the required \nnumber of samples. Id. § 141.86(d)(4)(ii). If the water system continues to \nmeet these conditions for additional monitoring periods, the water system \nmay become eligible to reduce its monitoring frequency further, to once \nevery three years. Id. § 141.86(d)(4)(iii).   \n62.  If, for any monitoring period, the water system exceeds the lead \naction level, or if water-quality monitoring shows problems with the \nsystem’s corrosion control treatment, the water system must resume \ncollecting a set of tap water samples every six months. Id. \n§ 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). \n63.   The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to report \ndetailed information about their tap water monitoring to the state \nenforcement agency. Id. § 141.90. Water systems must also notify customers \nof the individual results of tap water samples collected from their homes. \nId. § 141.85(d)(1)-(2).  \n21 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 23 of 58    Pg ID 23\n64.  EPA promulgated the Lead and Copper Rule because it \nunderstood the harmful effects that lead-contaminated drinking water can \nhave on citizens. See 56 Fed. Reg. at 26,463-66, 26,467-71. The Rule’s \nrequirements are intended to force public water systems to remain vigilant \nabout the possible infiltration of lead into drinking water, and to take \ncritical steps in the event of contamination. See id. at 26,481-82.  \nState control over Flint \n \n65.  In November 2011, pursuant to Michigan’s Local Financial \nStability and Choice Act, Governor Snyder declared a financial emergency \nin Flint and placed the City in a state-controlled receivership.  \n66.  A receivership is a process whereby local government officials \nare stripped of authority in favor of state-appointed personnel. Those state \nappointees control the local government’s finances and operations. See \nMich. Comp. Laws §§ 141.1549(1)-(2), .1551(1), .1552. Among the purposes \nof the receivership is to “assure the provision of necessary government \nservices essential to public health, safety, and welfare.” Id. § 141.1543(a).  \n67.  After placing the City into receivership, Governor Snyder \nappointed an Emergency Manager to govern all of the City’s operations. \nSee id. §§ 141.1542(q), .1549(2). Through this appointment, Governor Snyder \n22 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 24 of 58    Pg ID 24\nremoved authority from Flint’s elected Mayor and City Council. The \nEmergency Manager served at the pleasure of the Governor and could not \nbe removed by Flint voters. Id. § 141.1549(3)(d). \n68.  From November 2011 to April 2015, Flint had four successive \nemergency managers. The emergency managers were vested with “broad \npowers” to address the City’s financial emergency. These powers included \nthe authority to revise the City’s budget; make, approve, or disapprove any \ncontract; supervise heads of city departments; and exercise the powers of \n“any officer, employee, [or] department . . . of the local government, \nwhether elected or appointed.” Id. §§ 141.1552(1)(b), (g), (n), (ee), .1549(2). \nThe power of the emergency managers was “superior to and supersede[d]” \nthat of the City’s employees, departments, and elected officials. Id. \n§ 141.1552(1)(ee).   \n69.  In early 2015, the Emergency Manager hired Defendant \nNatasha Henderson as City Administrator. The Emergency Manager gave \nDefendant Henderson full authority to direct and supervise the day-to-day \noperations of the City, including directing the head of the Department of \nPublic Works and managing the operations of the Water System. The \nUtilities Department is located within the Department of Public Works and \n23 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 25 of 58    Pg ID 25\nis responsible for the supply and maintenance of water services.  \nDefendant Henderson also must approve and cosign with the Mayor all \ncontracts entered into, modified, or terminated by the City.    \n70.  Since her appointment, Defendant Henderson has directed the \noperation of the Water System. For instance, she has managed the City’s \npurchases of water meters, plumbing supplies, and chemicals to treat Flint \nRiver water at Flint’s Water Treatment Plant. In March 2015, she decided \nthat the City could hire a contractor to provide emergency leak detection \nservices for the Water System, and allowed the City to accept a $900,000 \nstate grant to pay for water-leak surveys. In April 2015, Defendant \nHenderson decided that the City could enter into a contract with \nconsultants to provide design, procurement, and construction services to \nthe Water Treatment Plant to install a new filter system. \n71.  On April 28, 2015, the Emergency Manager informed Governor \nSnyder that Flint’s financial emergency had been rectified. See Mich. Comp. \nLaws § 141.1562(1). Governor Snyder then removed the Emergency \nManager and, in his place, appointed the Receivership Transition Advisory \nBoard to manage the City’s affairs alongside city officials for the duration \nof Flint’s receivership. See id. § 141.1563(1). The Board’s members now \n24 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 26 of 58    Pg ID 26\ninclude Defendants Frederick Headen, Michael A. Townsend, David \nMcGhee, Michael A. Finney, and Beverly Walker-Griffea.    \n72.  The Board has had authority over the operations of the City \nsince its creation last spring. It must approve all ordinances and resolutions \nadopted by the City Council before they take effect, and must approve \npurchases and contracts over $75,000. The City Administrator advises and \nreports to the Board. She is required to submit regular reports to the Board \nregarding her activities and the overall operation of the City. Approval of \nthe Board is also required before the Mayor or City Council can change the \nresponsibilities of the City Administrator.  \n73.  Since its formation, the Board has made a number of decisions \ndirecting the operation of the Water System. For example, in August 2015, \nthe Board decided that the City could enter into a multi-year \nenvironmental monitoring services contract with a testing laboratory and \ndecided to allow the City to purchase chemicals to be used to treat water at \nFlint’s Water Treatment Plant. In October 2015, the Board decided whether \nthe City could purchase water distribution pipe repair parts for use in \nmaintaining the Water System.  \n74.  The Board is the primary but not exclusive state entity that \n25 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 27 of 58    Pg ID 27\nmanages the City’s operations during the City’s receivership. The State \nTreasurer, Defendant Nick A. Khouri, also manages aspects of the City’s \noperations. For example, during the pendency of the City’s receivership, \norders by the Emergency Manager may be amended only by the Board, but \nthe State Treasurer’s approval is also required. Similarly, the Mayor and \nCity Council cannot amend the budget that was adopted by the Emergency \nManager without approval of both the Board and the State Treasurer.  \n75.  The State Treasurer also exerts control over the Water System, \nincluding by having the final authority to decide whether the Water \nSystem can make large operational changes that involve budget \namendments. For instance, on information and belief, in early 2014, the \nState Treasurer decided whether the City could expend more than $3 \nmillion to upgrade its Water Treatment Plant to allow the City to use the \nFlint River as its primary drinking water source. The State Treasurer also \nexercised final decision-making power over the Water System’s choices \nabout where to get its drinking water. \n76.  Flint remains under the management of the Board and State \nTreasurer. The Mayor and City Council are stripped of all authority except \nas “specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager” prior to \n26 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 28 of 58    Pg ID 28\nthe elimination of his position last spring. Mich. Comp. Laws § 141.1549(2). \nThe Mayor and City Council are powerless to change any decisions made \nby the Emergency Manager until one year after Governor Snyder \nterminates the City’s receivership. \nChanges in Flint’s drinking water supply \n77.  Flint’s Water System provides drinking water to nearly 100,000 \npeople. The Water System includes the Flint Water Treatment Plant and \nmore than 600 miles of water distribution pipes.  \n78.  The Water System also has approximately 32,900 service line \nconnections, points where household and building plumbing connect to \nmain water distribution pipes. At least 15,000 of these connections are \nthrough lead service lines.    \n79.  For decades prior to 2014, the Water System purchased \npretreated or “finished” drinking water from the Detroit Water and \nSewerage Department (Detroit), which draws water from Lake Huron.  \n80.  “Finished” water is water that is ready to be delivered to \ncustomers for consumption without further treatment. See 40 C.F.R. § 141.2. \nThe Water System received finished water from Detroit and distributed it \nthrough its pipes and service lines to customers. Detroit treated the water \n27 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 29 of 58    Pg ID 29\nwith orthophosphate to reduce the amount of lead leaching from pipes and \nsolder.   \n81.  In March 2013, partially in response to rising water rates \ncharged by Detroit, the City Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water \nAuthority (KWA), a newly formed water supply system. The KWA plans \nto build a new pipeline to distribute Lake Huron water directly to mid-\nMichigan communities, including Flint. The KWA pipeline is scheduled for \ncompletion in June 2016. \n82.  The City Council’s vote to join the KWA was not immediately \neffective because the City was in state receivership. Only the Emergency \nManager and the State Treasurer had the power to authorize the City to \nenter into a contract to join the KWA. See Mich. Comp. Laws \n§ 141.1552(1)(g), (3). The Emergency Manager authorized the KWA \ncontract on March 29, 2013. \n83.  On April 16, 2013, after evaluating various options for the \nCity’s drinking water supply, the State Treasurer also authorized the KWA \ncontract.  \n84.  Although Detroit sought to avoid losing Flint as a customer, the \nEmergency Manager rejected Detroit’s final offer to renegotiate rates. \n28 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 30 of 58    Pg ID 30\nDetroit then terminated its existing contract with Flint. Pursuant to the \ncontract, the termination was scheduled to take effect a year later, in April \n2014. This was at least eighteen months before the new KWA pipeline was \nexpected to be ready. \n85.  Although Detroit offered to negotiate a short-term contract to \nsupply drinking water to Flint during the interim period, the Emergency \nManager declined Detroit’s proposals.  \n86.  In early 2014, the Emergency Manager and state officials \ndecided that the Water System would use the Flint River as a primary \ndrinking water source until the KWA pipeline was completed. \n87.  The Flint River suffers from significant water-quality problems. \nIndustrial waste and agricultural runoff have contributed to excessive \ncontamination. Fish in the River contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin, and \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are carcinogens. Swimming is not \nrecommended in the River after rain due to elevated levels of bacteria.  \n88.  Before switching to the Flint River as a water source, the Water \nSystem had not treated its own water on a regular basis for nearly fifty \nyears. It had never undertaken the analysis required by the Safe Drinking \nWater Act to identify and understand how a water system optimizes \n29 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 31 of 58    Pg ID 31\ncorrosion control treatment for drinking water. The Water Treatment \nPlant’s staff had not previously been responsible for managing the \ntreatment of water to control corrosion of lead pipes and solder.     \n89.  In 2011, outside consultants for the City analyzed whether the \nFlint River could be used as the City’s permanent primary source of \ndrinking water. The consultants concluded that the Flint Water Treatment \nPlant would need about $50 million in upgrades to equipment and systems \nto assure reliable delivery of safe drinking water to customers. \nNonetheless, the Water System did not perform all of the recommended \nupgrades in advance of distributing Flint River water to customers’ homes \nin 2014. \n90.  On April 29, 2014, the Water System began pumping Flint River \nwater through the System’s distribution pipes and into customers’ taps.  \n91.  The Water System did not treat the river water at all to reduce \nits corrosivity and minimize the leaching of lead from pipes and solder into \ncustomers’ drinking water.  \nThe effects on customers’ drinking water  \n92.  In the months following the Water System’s switch to the Flint \nRiver, customers reported that their tap water was discolored, laden with \n30 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 32 of 58    Pg ID 32\nsediment, and foul-smelling. Customers also reported skin rashes, hair loss, \nand vomiting after drinking and/or bathing in the water.  \n93.  In the summer of 2014, testing conducted by the Water System \nshowed elevated levels of total coliform bacteria, bacteria found in soil and \nin human and animal waste, in Flint’s drinking water. The City was forced \nto issue boil-water notices to some of its customers.   \n94.  To control the high levels of total coliform bacteria, the Water \nSystem increased its use of disinfectants.  \n95.  In December 2014, MDEQ notified the Water System that it was \nin violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act after high levels of total \ntrihalomethanes—byproducts of disinfection—were detected in the water. \nTrihalomethanes can cause serious health problems, including an increased \nrisk of cancer. \n96.  Despite these Safe Drinking Water Act violations, city and state \nofficials continued to tell Flint residents that their water was safe to drink. \n97.  Because the Water System had begun using a new water \nsource, MDEQ instructed the System to conduct lead tap water monitoring \nfor two six-month periods, gathering one hundred samples per period. \nMDEQ had the authority to require one hundred samples, even though in \n31 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 33 of 58    Pg ID 33\n2014 Flint’s population had fallen below 100,000 for the first time since the \n1920s. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.81(b)(iii), .86(d)(vii). The Water System initiated \nthe first six-month monitoring period in July 2014, and the second in \nJanuary 2015.  \n98.  To collect these samples, the Water System instructed \ncustomers to flush their taps for at least five minutes and then allow the \nwater to sit for at least six hours before drawing the sample. This practice, \nknown as “pre-flushing,” is intended to minimize the amount of lead \ncaptured in the sample and results in an under-reporting of the \nconcentration of lead in drinking water.  \n99.  Even though the Water System engaged in practices that \nunderestimate lead concentrations in drinking water, certain tap water \nsamples still returned high levels of lead. In February 2015, at least one \ncustomer’s water contained lead concentrations of more than 100 ppb, \nmore than six times the lead action level of 15 ppb. Subsequent testing at \nthe same home revealed lead levels of nearly 400 ppb. Medical records \nshowed that the blood lead level of the customer’s child had more than \ntripled since the Water System began using Flint River water. \n100.  That customer, concerned about the high levels of lead in her \n32 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 34 of 58    Pg ID 34\nwater, contacted EPA. After learning of her test results, staff in EPA’s \nregional office told MDEQ that the results raised significant concerns about \nthe corrosion of lead pipes within the Water System. An EPA Regulations \nManager later wrote a memo raising a “serious concern” about the high \nlead levels detected in the Water System’s drinking water and the System’s \nfailure to use any treatment to mitigate lead leaching from pipes and \nsolder. EPA shared the memo with MDEQ.  \n101.  By February 26, 2015, the Water System, state officials, and EPA \nstaff were all aware of sampling results showing high levels of lead in \nFlint’s drinking water. No one notified Flint residents.  \n102.  In March 2015, in response to growing complaints from the \ncommunity, the City Council voted to do “all things necessary” to end the \nuse of the Flint River as a water source. This vote had no effect, because the \nCity remained under the control of state-appointed officials. The \nEmergency Manager refused to approve the City Council’s vote, asserting \nthat Flint’s tap water was safe to drink and calling the elected officials’ \neffort to return to Detroit water “incomprehensible.” \n103.  In July 2015, the Water System sent a letter to its customers \nstating that their tap water was safe to drink and in compliance with all \n33 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 35 of 58    Pg ID 35\nSafe Drinking Water Act requirements. The Water System nonetheless \nadvised elderly residents, infants, and those with a severely compromised \nimmune system to consult their doctors before drinking the water.      \n104.  During the next two months, in response to intensifying citizen \nconcerns about lead in the City’s drinking water, researchers from Virginia \nPolytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) collected more \nthan 250 tap water samples from homes in Flint. More than ten percent of \nthe samples collected contained lead at levels over 25 ppb, well above the \nLead and Copper Rule’s action level for lead of 15 ppb. See 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.80(c)(1). Some samples collected by the Virginia Tech researchers \ncontained lead levels more than ten times greater than the lead action level.       \n105.  In response to these findings, state officials asserted that \nVirginia Tech’s sampling showed far higher lead levels than sampling \nconducted by the Water System. Those officials questioned the reliability of \nVirginia Tech’s results, and insisted that the City’s water contained lead \nlevels within allowable limits.  \n106.  On September 24, 2015, a Flint pediatrician released the \nfindings of a study showing that the proportion of Flint children with \nelevated blood lead levels had doubled since the Water System began \n34 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 36 of 58    Pg ID 36\nusing the Flint River as a drinking water source. State officials and \nGovernor Snyder’s office attempted to discredit the pediatrician’s data, \ncalling her work “unfortunate” in a time of “near-hysteria.” MDEQ \ncontinued to insist that Flint’s water was safe to drink.  \n107.  The following day, the City of Flint issued a Lead Advisory \nsuggesting that residents flush their taps for at least five minutes prior to \ndrinking the water; use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and making \nbaby formula; and install water filters certified for lead removal. The Lead \nAdvisory did not tell residents that Flint’s water was unsafe to drink.  \n108.  The Board of Commissioners in Genesee County, where Flint is \nlocated, issued a Public Health Advisory a few days later, also urging Flint \nresidents to use filters certified to remove lead before drinking tap water, \nor to drink bottled water.   \n109.  On September 30, 2015, Governor Snyder for the first time \nacknowledged that the City’s water supply “appears” to have increased \nlead levels.   \n110.  The Genesee County Board of Commissioners declared a Public \nHealth Emergency in Flint on October 1, 2015. It advised Flint residents not \nto drink water from the Water System unless it had been run through a \n35 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 37 of 58    Pg ID 37\nfilter certified to remove lead or tested to confirm the water does not \ncontain elevated lead levels.    \n111.  That same day, Plaintiffs submitted a petition to EPA asking it \nto issue an emergency order pursuant to its authority under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 300i(a). Plaintiffs asked EPA to take \nimmediate action to address the danger to Flint residents from lead in their \nwater. EPA did not act. \n112.  In early October, tap water sampling conducted by MDEQ \nshowed that three Flint schools had tap water with lead levels that \nexceeded the action level. Subsequent testing confirmed elevated lead \nlevels in drinking water at seven of Flint’s schools.  \n113.  In mid-October, following a request from the City \nAdministrator, the Board decided that the City could amend its budget to \nallow the Water System to return to Detroit’s water supply. The same day, \nthe Board also decided that the City Administrator could enter into \nagreements with Detroit and other local entities to execute the switch back \nto Detroit’s water.  \n114.  On information and belief, the State Treasurer then approved \nthe budget appropriation for Flint to return to Detroit’s water supply.  \n36 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 38 of 58    Pg ID 38\n115.  On October 16, 2015, the Water System resumed using Detroit’s \npretreated Lake Huron water as its drinking water. \n116.  After Flint’s return to Detroit water, the water in Flint did not \nbecome safe to drink. The Water System’s extended failure to treat the Flint \nRiver water with phosphates—combined with the highly corrosive nature \nof the water—had stripped the protective coating from the inside of the \nWater System’s pipes and service lines. As this coating had taken years to \nbuild up, the damage to the Water System’s infrastructure cannot be \nreversed right away, if ever, even though the System is again receiving \nwater from Detroit pretreated with corrosion-inhibiting chemicals. This \ndamage is allowing lead to continue to leach into Flint’s drinking water. \n117.  In early December 2015, the Water System began \nsupplementing Detroit’s water treatment by adding more phosphates to \nfurther reduce the corrosivity of the water and control for the corrosion of \nlead pipes and solder.  \n118.  Two weeks later, on December 14, 2015, Flint Mayor Karen \nWeaver declared a State of Emergency in Flint.  \n119.  On January 5, 2016, Governor Snyder declared a State of \nEmergency in Genesee County. The next week, Governor Snyder activated \n37 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 39 of 58    Pg ID 39\nthe National Guard and requested help from the federal government to \naddress the lead-contamination crisis.  \n120.  Days later, President Obama declared a federal emergency in \nFlint, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide \ndisaster relief. \n121.  On January 21, 2016, EPA issued an Emergency Administrative \nOrder declaring that the lead contamination in Flint posed an imminent \nand substantial endangerment to human health, and directing the City, the \nState of Michigan, and MDEQ to take certain remedial measures. EPA’s \naction came nearly a year after it was first made aware of sampling results \nshowing high levels of lead in Flint’s drinking water, and nearly four \nmonths after Plaintiffs submitted a petition to the agency asking it to act \nunder its emergency authority. While the City has stated it will comply \nwith EPA’s order, Michigan and MDEQ have challenged EPA’s legal \nauthority to require some of the actions that EPA demands.  \n122.  Despite awareness at the local, state, and federal levels of the \nlead-contamination crisis in Flint, tap water distributed from the Water \nSystem remains unsafe to drink. \n38 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 40 of 58    Pg ID 40\nThe Water System is failing to maintain optimal corrosion control \ntreatment  \n \n123.  The Water System is no longer “operat[ing] and maintain[ing] \noptimal corrosion control treatment” as required by the Lead and Copper \nRule. 40 C.F.R. § 141.82(g).  \n124.  Prior to the Water System’s switch to the Flint River as a \ndrinking water source, Detroit treated water delivered to Flint’s customers \nto control the leaching of lead from pipes and solder. \n125.  In the early 1990s, Detroit conducted a multi-year study to \ndetermine the optimal approach to controlling lead in its system’s drinking \nwater. The study evaluated water-quality data and information about the \nsystem’s pipe materials; identified and analyzed feasible treatment \nmethods to control corrosion; and designed and pilot-tested the treatment \nalternatives. Detroit determined that its water should be treated with \northophosphate to optimize corrosion control, and, with MDEQ’s approval, \nbegan implementing that treatment. The Water System coordinated with \nDetroit to ensure the System’s compliance with the Lead and Copper \nRule’s requirement to implement an optimal corrosion control treatment \nprogram. The Water System relied on Detroit to treat the water with \n39 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 41 of 58    Pg ID 41\northophosphate before delivering the finished water to Flint. On \ninformation and belief, through Detroit’s orthophosphate treatment, the \nWater System was able to minimize the amount of lead leaching from pipes \nand solder. \n126.  By coordinating with Detroit, the Water System optimized its \ncorrosion control treatment program as of January 1999. The Water \nSystem’s cooperation with Detroit did not exempt it from the Lead and \nCopper Rule’s requirements, including the requirement to maintain \noptimal corrosion control treatment. See 56 Fed. Reg. at 26,497-98. \n127.  From April 29, 2014, when the Water System began distributing \nFlint River water, through at least October 16, 2015, the Water System \nfailed to maintain optimal corrosion control treatment because it did not \ntreat the river water with corrosion-inhibiting chemicals or any other form \nof treatment to minimize the amount of lead leaching from the System’s \npipes and solder.  \n128.  Flint River water is highly corrosive. It is significantly more \ncorrosive than water from Lake Huron. Because Flint River water is highly \ncorrosive, the Water System’s use of the river water without treatment to \ncontrol corrosion destroyed the protective coating that had built up inside \n40 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 42 of 58    Pg ID 42\nthe System’s pipes and solder. The absence of this protective coating \ncaused dangerous amounts of lead to enter Flint’s drinking water.  \n129.  Since October 16, 2015, when the Water System resumed \ndistributing water from Detroit, the Water System has failed to maintain \noptimal corrosion control treatment because it has not minimized the \nconcentration of lead at customers’ taps. 40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  \n130.  The corrosivity of the river water damaged the Water System’s \ninfrastructure, including by destroying the protective coating that had \nformed inside the System’s water pipes over many years. As a result of this \ndamage, the Water System is not currently maintaining optimal corrosion \ncontrol treatment. On information and belief, because of this damage to the \nWater System’s infrastructure, additional chemical treatment of Detroit’s \npretreated water is necessary to implement an optimal corrosion control \ntreatment program.  \n131.  On information and belief, the Water System’s failure to treat \nthe river water to control corrosion has caused and continues to cause \ndangerous levels of lead to enter customers’ tap water.   \n132.  The Water System plans to switch water sources again in \nsummer of 2016. The Water System will use Lake Huron water distributed \n41 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 43 of 58    Pg ID 43\nthrough the KWA pipeline as its new water source.  \n133.  After this switch, the Water System will be required to treat the \nLake Huron water to control for the corrosion of lead pipes and solder. \n134.  On information and belief, the Water System has not gathered \nor analyzed background water chemistry information about the new KWA \nwater source; has not evaluated corrosion control treatment options for the \nnew KWA water source; has not conducted pilot-scale tests using lead \npipes extracted from the System to determine the effectiveness of different \ncorrosion control treatment alternatives; and has not procured the \nspecialized equipment or developed the equipment operating skills \nnecessary to maintain an optimal corrosion control treatment program.  \n135.  On information and belief, the Water System’s failure to \nmaintain optimal corrosion control treatment is likely to continue until the \nSystem switches to the new KWA water source, and is likely to continue or \nrecur when the System switches to the new KWA water source.  \nThe Water System is failing to comply with the Lead and Copper \nRule’s monitoring requirements   \n \n136.  The Water System is not monitoring for lead contamination in \naccordance with the Lead and Copper Rule. As a result, the Water System \n42 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 44 of 58    Pg ID 44\ncannot promptly or reliably detect elevated lead levels in its drinking \nwater. \nSampling site selection  \n \n137.  Before a water system begins monitoring for lead at household \ntaps, it must identify a pool of targeted sampling sites. 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.86(a)(1). The sampling pool must target homes that have a high risk \nof lead contamination. See id. § 141.86(a)(3)-(8). For water systems like \nFlint’s that regularly serve more than twenty-five people, this means that \nthe sampling pool must, if possible, consist of single-family homes that are \nserved by a lead service line and/or contain lead pipes or copper pipes \nwith lead solder installed after 1982. Id. § 141.86(a)(3).   \n138.  The pool must also be large enough to ensure that the water \nsystem can collect the required number of samples during each monitoring \nperiod. Id. § 141.86(a)(1).   \n139.  During each monitoring period, a water system must collect the \nminimum required number of samples from homes that are part of the \nsystem’s sampling pool. Id.  \n140.  A water system that contains lead service lines must also collect \nhalf of its samples from homes served by a lead service line, and half from \n43 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 45 of 58    Pg ID 45\nhomes that contain lead pipes or copper pipes with lead solder. Id. \n§ 141.86(a)(8). If a water system cannot identify a sufficient number of \nhomes served by lead service lines, then it must collect samples from all \nhomes it has identified as being served by lead service lines. Id.  \n141.  In addition to the tap water samples collected from the water \nsystem’s targeted sampling pool, the system may collect more samples \nfrom homes not included in its pool at a customer’s request. Those \ncustomer-requested samples do not count towards the system’s minimum \nnumber of required samples under the Rule. See id. § 141.86(a)(1), (c). \nCustomer-requested samples generally must, however, be included when \nthe water system calculates whether more than ten percent of its total \ncollected samples exceed the lead action level of 15 ppb. \n142.  After the Water System began using the Flint River as a water \nsource, it collected household tap water samples during two six-month \nmonitoring periods, between July and December 2014 and between \nJanuary and June 2015. The Water System serves a sufficient number of \nsingle-family homes with a lead service line or lead pipes that its sampling \npool must consist entirely of such homes. \n143.  During its July–December 2014 and January–June 2015 \n44 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 46 of 58    Pg ID 46\nmonitoring periods, the Water System requested that city employees \nvolunteer to submit tap water samples, without regard to whether those \nemployees lived in homes served by a lead service line or containing lead \npipes.  \n144.  At least six city employees submitted tap water samples during \nthe City’s January–June 2015 monitoring period. On information and belief, \nthe Water System included these samples as part of its monitoring for lead \nwithout verifying or even inquiring whether these samples came from \nhomes that are served by a lead service line or contain lead pipes.  \n145.  The City’s Utilities Administrator, Michael Glasgow, has stated \nthat the Water System “throw[s] bottles out everywhere” to collect the \nrequired number of tap water samples, without regard to whether the \nhomes from which samples are collected are served by a lead service line or \ncontain lead pipes.    \n146.  From July 2014 to the present, the Water System has not \ntargeted and is not targeting homes at high risk of contamination when \nmonitoring for lead.  \n147.  Prior to the July–December 2014 monitoring period, the Water \nSystem did not identify a pool of targeted sampling sites large enough to \n45 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 47 of 58    Pg ID 47\nensure that it could collect the number of tap water samples required by \nthe Lead and Copper Rule. The Water System also failed to identify a \ntargeted pool prior to the beginning of the January-June 2015 monitoring \nperiod.  \n148.  The Water System did not select all of the sampled homes from \nan existing sampling pool during either monitoring period.  \n149.  The Water System does not have comprehensive, reliable \ninformation identifying the locations of its more than 15,000 lead service \nlines. On information and belief, the Water System has not consistently \nused and does not consistently use the records it may have concerning the \nlocations of lead service lines to confirm that its samples are collected from \nhomes with lead service lines.  \n150.  On information and belief, for monitoring conducted from July \n2014 through the present, the Water System has not ensured or verified and \nis not ensuring or verifying that half of its samples are collected from \nhomes served by a lead service line, and that half of its samples are \ncollected from homes that have lead pipes or copper pipes with lead \nsolder. Because of its lack of knowledge of where its lead service lines are \nlocated, the Water System cannot reliably ensure that during each \n46 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 48 of 58    Pg ID 48\nmonitoring period, it collects at least half of its samples from homes served \nby a lead service line.    \n151.  On information and belief, the Water System has yet to identify \na pool of targeted tap water sampling sites that meet the high-risk criteria \nset forth in the Lead and Copper Rule and is large enough to ensure that \nthe System can collect the required number of tap water samples during \nfuture monitoring periods.  \n152.  On information and belief, the Water System will continue to \nmonitor for lead in household tap water without using an existing, \nsampling pool of high-risk sites to select the homes from which it collects \nsamples.  \nSampling sites across monitoring periods \n153.   During each monitoring period, the Lead and Copper Rule \nrequires water systems to collect samples from the same homes. 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.86(b)(4). If the water system cannot gain entry into a previously \nsampled home, or if a previously sampled home no longer fits the Rule’s \nhigh-risk criteria, then the system may collect a sample from another home \nin its sampling pool. Id. The home selected as a replacement sampling site \nmust be located near the previously sampled home and meet the same \n47 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 49 of 58    Pg ID 49\nhigh-risk criteria. Id.  \n154.  For the January–June 2015 monitoring period, the Water \nSystem collected tap water samples from only thirteen of the one hundred \nhomes used during the previous six-month monitoring period. Each of \nthese thirteen sampling sites had lead levels below the lead action level \nduring the previous monitoring period.  \n155.  On information and belief, during the January–June 2015 \nmonitoring period, for any homes sampled during the previous monitoring \nperiod into which the Water System could no longer gain entry or that no \nlonger met the Rule’s high-risk criteria, the System did not collect tap water \nsamples from other homes selected from an existing sampling pool that \nwere located nearby and met the same high-risk criteria.  \n156.  On information and belief, the Water System is failing and/or \nwill continue to fail to collect tap water samples at the same homes from \nwhich it collected samples during previous monitoring periods. The Water \nSystem is also failing and/or will continue to fail to replace homes in its \nsampling pool when necessary with homes that are nearby and meet the \nsame high-risk criteria.  \n48 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 50 of 58    Pg ID 50\nThe Water System is failing to comply with the Lead and Copper \nRule’s reporting requirements  \n \n157.  The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to report to \nstate regulators all tap water sampling results for lead, including the \nlocation or “site” where each sample was collected. 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.90(a)(1)(i). For each sampling site, the water system must also report \nthe basis on which the site was selected for the system’s sampling pool, \nincluding whether the site is served by a lead service line or contains lead \npipes. Id.; see id. § 141.86(a)(3)(i)-(ii).   \n158.  If a water system does not collect tap water samples from the \nsame sites across monitoring periods, the water system must mark or \n“designate” each site that was not sampled during the previous monitoring \nperiod, and explain why the sampling site changed. Id. § 141.90(a)(1)(v). \n159.  These requirements ensure that the water system is sampling in \nhigh-risk homes, and prevent the system from purposely avoiding \nsampling sites that have yielded high lead results in past monitoring \nperiods.  \n160.  The Water System is not accurately reporting to MDEQ \nwhether its sampling sites are served by lead services lines or contain lead \n49 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 51 of 58    Pg ID 51\npipes. For at least six tap water samples collected between July 1, 2014, and \nJune 30, 2015, the Water System falsely reported to MDEQ that the sites \nwere served by lead service lines, when in fact they were not.  \n161.  On information and belief, the Water System does not have \naccurate information to identify whether its sampling sites are served by \nlead service lines or contain lead pipes. The Water System is likely to \ncontinue to fail to accurately report whether its sampling sites are served \nby lead service lines or contain lead pipes. \n162.  The Water System also is not reporting required information to \nMDEQ when the System fails to sample the same sites across monitoring \nperiods. \n163.  For both the July–December 2014 and January–June 2015 \nmonitoring periods, the Water System did not use the same sampling sites \nas in the previous monitoring periods. The Water System did not designate \nfor MDEQ each new sampling site from which it collected a tap water \nsample during these monitoring periods. The Water System did not \nadequately explain—and in some cases, did not explain at all—the changes \nin its sampling sites from one monitoring period to the next.   \n164.  The Water System is likely to continue its practice of not \n50 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 52 of 58    Pg ID 52\ndesignating each new sampling site from which it collects a tap water \nsample. The Water System is also likely to continue its practice of failing to \nexplain changes in its sampling sites from previous monitoring periods.   \nThe Water System is failing to comply with the Lead and Copper \nRule’s notification requirements  \n \n165.  The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to notify the \nindividuals residing at each sampling site of their tap water sampling \nresults for lead. 40 C.F.R. § 141.85(d)(1). A water system must provide this \nnotice “no later than 30 days after the system learns of the tap monitoring \nresults.” Id. § 141.85(d)(2).  \n166.  On information and belief, for monitoring conducted from July \n1, 2014, through June 30, 2015, the Water System failed to notify \nindividuals residing at each sampling site of their tap water sampling \nresults for lead within thirty days after the System learned of the results.  \n167.  On information and belief, for monitoring conducted from July \n1, 2015, through the present, the Water System is continuing to fail to notify \nindividuals residing at each sampling site of their tap water sampling \nresults for lead within thirty days after the System learns of the results. \n51 \n   \n\n2:16-cv-10277-MAG-SDD   Doc # 1   Filed 01/27/16   Pg 53 of 58    Pg ID 53\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s requirement to operate and \nmaintain optimal corrosion control treatment, 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.81-.82) \n \n168.
