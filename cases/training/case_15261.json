Gloucester County School Board, case number 16A52, which held that the U.S. Department of Education's guidance as to the interpretation of \"on the basis of sex\" in its regulation implementing Title IX was entitled to Auer deference. As a result of today's telephone hearing, the court directs the parties to address the following: (1) whether, and if so how, the Supreme Court's stay of the mandate in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board affects this court, including as to the rules of law this court must apply; (2) this courts authority to grant preliminary injunctive relief, on a facial basis or otherwise, beyond the scope of the individually named Plaintiffs (both under Title IX and as a constitutional matter). Plaintiffs' briefs are due by 5:00 p.m. Monday, August 8, 2016. Defendants' responses are due by noon on Friday, August 12, 2016. Briefs are limited to 20 pages per side, and the parties are encouraged to work together. In addition, the parties are directed to meet and confer to determine if there is any value in adjusting the pretrial or trial schedule and whether or not there is agreement to participate in this district's mediation process. Parties are to report back via letter to Ms. Engle as to the results of the conference by 5:00 p.m. on August 8, 2016. SO ORDERED. Associated Cases: 1:16cv236, 1:16cv425, 1:16cv845(Engle, Anita)"

In light of the Joint Notice filed by the parties, the Court will not set this matter for a status conference on August 26, 2016. However, it appears that a status conference in the near future would be appropriate, in order to address any discovery and scheduling issues. Therefore, the Court will plan to conduct a discovery status conference on September 2, 2016, and given the potential issues to be addressed, the Court will conduct that status conference in person rather than by telephone hearing. Therefore, this matter will be set for a discovery status conference on September 2, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 3 of United States Courthouse in Winston-Salem, NC. The parties should file their Joint Notice by August 31, 2016 to outline any issues that they would seek to raise at the status conference.

With respect to public facilities that are subject to Executive Branch Defendants' control or supervision, the Consent Parties agree that nothing in Section 2 of H.B. 142 can be construed by the Executive Branch Defendants to prevent transgender people from lawfully using public facilities in accordance with their gender identity. The Executive Branch Defendants as used in this paragraph shall include their successors, officers, and employees. This Order does not preclude any of the Parties from challenging or acting in accordance with future legislation. 2. The Executive Branch Defendants, in their official capacities, and all successors, officers, and employees are hereby permanently enjoined from applying Section 2 of H.B. 142 to bar, prohibit, block, deter, or impede any transgender individuals from using public facilities under any Executive Branch Defendants control or supervision, in accordance with the transgender individual's gender identity. Under the authority granted by the General Statutes existing as of December 21, 2018, and notwithstanding N.C.G.S. § 114-11.6, the Executive Branch Defendants are enjoined from prosecuting an individual under Section 2 of H.B. 142 for using public facilities under the control or supervision of the Executive Branch, when such otherwise lawful use conforms with the individual's gender identity. 3. The Consent Parties shall each bear their own fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the Executive Branch Defendants. 4. All remaining claims filed by Plaintiffs against the Executive Branch Defendants in this action are hereby dismissed with prejudice. (Garland, Leah) (Entered: 07/23/2019)"

    "summary": "<p>This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (&ldquo;H.B. 2&rdquo;), which was passed in March 23, 2016. For the others, see the related cases section below.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting antidiscrimination policies and removed the statutory and common law private right of action to enforce state antidiscrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that, in government buildings, individuals only be permitted to use restrooms and changing facilities that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates. For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity. (In North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules.) In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's antidiscrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,&rdquo; which prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2016, the ACLU and the Lambda Legal Defense Fund filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, challenging the constitutionality and legality of HB2 under federal law. They sued under 42 U.S.C &sect; 1983 and Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Several transgender individuals, lesbian couples, the North Carolina Chapter of the ACLU, and the non-profit organization Equality North Carolina were the plaintiffs. They asked the court to declare most of HB2 unconstitutional or illegal under Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972; enjoin North Carolina from enforcing the illegal portions of HB2; and award plaintiffs costs, expenses, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. They also sought separate injunctive relief requiring the State of North Carolina to allow individuals to use single-sex facilities in accordance with their gender identity in public buildings, and requiring the state to allow local governments in North Carolina to enact and enforce antidiscrimination protections for LGBT people.</p>\r\n<p>On May 25, 2016, Philip Berger, the President pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, moved to intervene as defendants. The Court granted the motion on June 3, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the defendants, the University of North Carolina, also asked the judge to stay proceedings against them pending the final resolution of the cases G.G v. Gloucester School Board and United States v. North Carolina. <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The G.G. case</a>, was a Virginia case where a transgender student's high school denied him access to multi-occupancy, gender-segregated facilities that matched his gender identity. That case made it to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the court found that the district court judge had erred both in his refusal to consider evidence favoring the plaintiff when he denied their motion for preliminary injunctive relief, and in his failure to give deference to the DOE&rsquo;s interpretation of Title IX when granting the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. The Circuit then remanded the case to the district court judge, who granted a preliminary injunction. United States v. North Carolina is a case filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the State of North Carolina in which the DOJ made many of the same legal arguments made by the plaintiffs in this case, which was also in an early stage of litigation.</p>\r\n<p>On August 26, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. Judge Thomas D. Schroeder concluded that the individual plaintiffs suing under Title IX were likely to succeed on the merits, so he granted the injunction with respect to that claim. The court was unconvinced, however, that the plaintiffs would win on their Equal Protection claims and also reserved ruling on the Due Process claims until further briefing. 203 F.Supp.3d 615. On August 29, 2016 the plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from the order denying in part their motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that included a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in addition to the Title IX, Due Process, and Equal Protection claims. On December 16, 2016, Judge Schroeder granted a motion for a stay of proceedings until G.G. has been decided by the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>On January 1, 2017, Roy Cooper assumed the office of Governor of North Carolina. During his victory speech, then Governor-Elect Cooper stated his intention to repeal HB 2. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded G.G. back to the Fourth Circuit on March 6, 2017, in light of the DOE and DOJ's release of new interpretations of Title IX in February of 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the North Carolina Legislature and newly elected Governor Roy Cooper enacted House Bill 142 which, among other things, repealed HB2. The repeal included a compromise that left many on both sides unhappy. It prevented municipalities from passing antidiscrimination laws until December 2020 and the legislature maintained the ability to regulate bathrooms.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2017, Judge Motz on the Fourth Circuit dismissed the interlocutory appeal of August 26, 2016. On May 2, 2017, Judge Schroeder lifted the preliminary injunction of August 26, 2016 with the agreement of all parties, because House Bill 142 effectively repealed the law at issue in the Court&rsquo;s prior order.</p>\r\n<p>On September 7, 2017 the plaintiffs submitted a fourth amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages challenging the constitutionality of House Bill 142. The plaintiffs alleged that the law was promoted as a repeal of HB 2 to attract business back to North Carolina but only passed through the General Assembly because, like HB 2, it continued to discriminate against transgender individuals with respect to the use of single-sex, multiple-user facilities, and continued to bar local government protections for LGBT people. The complaint quoted multiple NC lawmakers who publicly stated that HB 2&rsquo;s bathroom ban, remained an integral part of HB 142. The complaint further alleged the harms that were of concern in HB 2 remained a concern in HB 142.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, 2017 the plaintiffs and Executive Branch defendants entered a joint motion of consent decree; the decree stated that the Executive Branch was enjoined from taking certain specified actions under Section 2 of H.B. 142 and, with respect to public facilities that were subject to the Executive Branch Defendants&rsquo; control or supervision, HB 142 did not prevent transgender people from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity. Both parties submitted memorandum in support of the joint motion for consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2017, intervenors and the University of North Carolina defendants submitted motions to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On November 2, 2017, the intervenor defendants asked the court to extend the time for the parties to respond to the consent decree, in light of the motion to dismiss claims. Judge Schroeder ordered the extension of 30 days following the date of the court&rsquo;s disposition of the pending motions to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; fourth amended complaint. After several extensions, UNC&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint for failure to state a claim was submitted to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder on January 17, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Schroeder granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing as to their substantive due process, Title IX and Title VII claims based on alleged legal uncertainty caused by HB142 but did have standing to pursue their equal protection claims relating to the preemption provisions of Sections 2 and 3, except as to the claims against the President of the UNC. The court declined to dismiss the contingent claims involving HB2 and reserved ruling on the nominal damages claims for alleged Title VII and IX violations during the time HB2 was in effect. The court found that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim based on Section 2 of HB2 but succeeded in stating a claim based on Section 3. Thus, the court dismissed claims 1, 2, 6, and 7 against UNC without prejudice but sustained claims 3, 4, and 5. The court dismissed claims 1 and 2 against the intervenor-defendants without prejudice, but allowed the equal protection claim in count 2 to survive as well as claims 3, 4, and 5.</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2018, the plaintiffs and the Executive Branch defendants filed a joint motion for entry of a consent decree. The consent decree provided that nothing in HB142 could be construed to prevent transgender people from lawfully using public facilities in accordance with their gender identity and permanently enjoined the Executive Branch defendants in their official capacities, and all successors, officers, and employees, from taking certain specified actions under Section 2 of H.B. 142 as well as forbidding Executive Branch Defendants from enforcing Section 3 to restrict any local government from interpreting other existing laws as protecting against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. The parties agreed to each bear their own fees, expenses, and costs and to dismiss all remaining claims against the Executive Branch defendants with prejudice. The intervenor-defendants opposed the joint motion for a consent decree, believing that it manufactured relief for dismissed claims that the Court lacked jurisdiction over, and that it did not reflect a true settlement of legal conflict, but rather was an effort to obtain a political result from the court that they could not achieve through electoral means.</p>\r\n<p>On May 20, 2019, the court stayed the remaining proceedings regarding the Title VII and Title IX claims pending the outcome of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17313\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton County</a> (140 S.Ct. 1731), a case from Georgia challenging whether the definition of \"sex discrimination\" under Title VII necessarily included discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Meanwhile, the parties submitted a joint motion for a consent decree on May 31, which was entered as a judgement on July 23, 2019. This consent decree was substantially similar to the one described above.</p>\r\n<p><em>Bostock</em> was decided on June 15, 2020. The Court ruled that Title VII did prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. Justice Gorsuch's majority opinion reasoned that it constituted discrimination on the basis of sex by accepting conduct by behavior by members of one sex as acceptable while not for another.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, the court ordered on December 17, 2020, that the parties meet and confer on the remaining claims with the <em>Bostock</em> ruling in mind. The parties sought additional time to finalize their agreement and asked that the stay be extended through early 2021. On March 11, 2021, the parties entered a joint stipulation to dismiss the remaining claims with prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On March 28, 2016, the ACLU and Lamda Legal Fund sued the State of North Carolina on behalf of LGBT individuals over a law called HB2 (the “bathroom bill”), which denied transgender individuals access to single-sex facilities that matched their gender-identities in public buildings. \r\nOn August 26, 2017 Judge Schroeder of the Middle District of North Carolina granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. On May 2, 2017 Judge Schroeder lifted the preliminary injunction with the agreement of all parties, because House Bill 142 repealed the basis for the Court’s prior order. On December 21, 2018, the executive branch defendants and the plaintiff filed a joint motion for a consent decree to settle the claims against the executive branch defendants.

No. 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP \n   \nROY A. COOPER, III, et al., \n       \nDefendants, \n \n    and \n \nPHIL BERGER, et al.,  \n \nIntervenor-Defendants.  \n \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH DEFENDANTS’  \nSUPPLEMENTAL JOINT MOTION FOR ENTRY OF A CONSENT DECREE \n \nNOW COME Plaintiffs Joaquín Carcaño, Payton Grey McGarry, Hunter Schafer, \nQuinton Harper, Angela Gilmore, Madeline Goss, and American Civil Liberties Union of \nNorth Carolina (collectively, “Plaintiffs”); and Defendants Roy A. Cooper III, Joshua \nStein, Machelle Sanders, Mandy K. Cohen, and James H. Trogdon III (collectively, \n“Executive Branch Defendants”) (Plaintiffs and Executive Branch Defendants are \ncollectively referred to herein as “the Parties”), by and through their attorneys, and move \nthe Court pursuant to Local Rule 7.1 for entry of a Consent Judgment and Decree, filed \nconcurrently with this motion.  In support thereof the Parties state as follows: \n1 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 264   Filed 12/21/18   Page 1 of 7\n\n \n1.  On September 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint, \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages (D.E. 210), alleging that \nPlaintiffs are entitled to relief from this Court for violations of their rights under the Due \nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e, et seq. \n2.  After Plaintiffs moved the Court, with consent of all parties, to file their \nFourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs and the Executive Branch Defendants engaged in \nsubstantial good faith negotiations about a potential settlement of Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the Executive Branch Defendants. \n3.  Following those negotiations, on October 18, 2017, the Parties requested \nthat the Court enter a Consent Judgment and Decree, filed concurrently with a joint \nmotion, to resolve all of Plaintiffs’ claims against the Executive Branch Defendants.  The \nCourt additionally permitted the Executive Branch Defendants to answer or file other \nresponsive pleadings to the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint, if applicable, 30 days \nafter the court’s disposition of the joint motion for entry of a consent decree.  (D.E. 226). \n4.   In the interim, Intervenor-Defendants and the UNC Defendants in this \nproceeding filed motions to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint.  (D.E. 221, 222).  \nThe Court determined to “defer consideration of the proposed consent decree until the \nvarious Defendants’ pending challenges to the court’s jurisdiction are resolved” (D.E. \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 264   Filed 12/21/18   Page 2 of 7\n\n \n226), and extended the time to file responses to the original Joint Motion for Entry of a \nConsent Decree until after the Court’s disposition of the motions to dismiss.  (D.E. 228). \n5.  On September 30, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part the \nIntervenor-Defendants’ and the UNC Defendants’ motions to dismiss.  (D.E. 248).  In its \norder, the Court ordered the parties to submit additional briefing concerning the Joint \nMotion for Entry of a Consent Decree.  (Id.).  The parties have since sought and received \nan extension until December 21, 2018 to file any supplemental motion for entry of a \nconsent decree.  (D.E. 253, 260). \n6.  Since the Court’s order resolving the Intervenor-Defendants’ and the UNC \nDefendants’ motions to dismiss, and informed by that decision, Plaintiffs and the \nExecutive Branch Defendants have again engaged in extensive negotiations concerning \nthe possibility of modifying a consent decree to settle all of Plaintiffs’ claims against the \nExecutive Branch Defendants.  The proposed consent decree filed with this motion is the \nculmination of those negotiations. \n7.  The proposed Consent Judgment and Decree filed with this motion, and the \nParties’ respective accompanying memoranda of law in support, entirely supplant and \nreplace the Parties’ prior proposed consent decree and associated briefing. \n8.  The proposed Consent Decree provides that, with respect to public facilities \nthat are subject to the Executive Branch Defendants’ control or supervision, nothing in \nHouse Bill 142, codified as Session Law 2017-4 (“H.B. 142”), can be construed to \nprevent transgender people from lawfully using public facilities in accordance with their \ngender identity.  See Consent Judgment and Decree at 5 ¶ 1. \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 264   Filed 12/21/18   Page 3 of 7\n\n \n9.  The Consent Decree also permanently enjoins the Executive Branch \nDefendants, in their official capacities, and all successors, officers, and employees, from \ntaking certain specified actions under Section 2 of H.B. 142.  See Consent Judgment and \nDecree at 6 ¶ 2.   \n10.  The Consent Decree also permanently enjoins the Executive Branch \nDefendants, in their official capacities, and all successors, officers, and employees, from \nenforcing Section 3 of H.B. 142 to restrict any local government from interpreting other \nexisting laws as protecting against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, \ngender identity or gender expression.  See Consent Judgment and Decree at 6 ¶ 3. \n11.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the Parties agree to each bear their own \nfees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the \nExecutive Branch Defendants, and all remaining claims Plaintiffs allege against the \nExecutive Branch Defendants in this action would be dismissed with prejudice.  See \nConsent Judgment and Decree at 6 ¶¶ 4-5. \n12.  In support of this motion, the Parties submit respective memoranda of law, \naddressing all necessary elements for this Court’s entry of a consent decree. \n13.  The Parties seek leave to present oral argument in support of this Motion \npursuant to Local Rule 7.3(c)(1). \nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, and for those set forth in the Parties’ \nsupporting memoranda of law, the Parties respectfully move the Court to enter the \nConsent Judgment and Decree, filed concurrently with this joint motion, as a full and \nfinal resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims against the Executive Branch Defendants.   \n4 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 264   Filed 12/21/18   Page 4 of 7\n\n \nDated: December 21, 2018  Respectfully submitted,   \n/s/ Christopher A.

By singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly \nwriting discrimination against transgender people into state law, H.B. 2 violates the most \nbasic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  In February 2016, the City of Charlotte enacted an ordinance (the \n“Ordinance”) that extended existing municipal anti-discrimination protections to LGBT \npeople.  In light of the pervasive discrimination faced by LGBT people—and particularly \ntransgender people—advocates had long pressed the Charlotte City Council for these \nprotections.  Because North Carolina state law does not expressly prohibit discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity, many LGBT residents of Charlotte—as \nwell as LGBT residents throughout the state—are exposed to invidious discrimination in \ntheir day-to-day lives simply for being themselves.  After two hours-long hearings, in \nwhich there was extensive public comment on both sides of the issue, the Charlotte City \nCouncil voted to adopt the Ordinance.   \n3.  Before the Ordinance could take effect, the North Carolina General \nAssembly rushed to convene a special session with the express purpose of passing a \nstatewide law that would preempt Charlotte’s “radical” move to protect its residents from \ndiscrimination.  In a process rife with procedural irregularities, the legislature introduced \nand passed H.B. 2 in a matter of hours, and the Governor signed the bill into law that \nsame day.  Lawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality, \ninstead openly and virulently attacking transgender people, who were falsely portrayed as \npredatory and dangerous to others.  While the discriminatory, stated focus of the \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 2 of 57\n\n \nlegislature in passing H.B. 2—the use of restrooms by transgender people—is on its own \nillegal and unconstitutional, H.B. 2 in fact wreaks far greater damage by also prohibiting \nlocal governments in North Carolina from enacting express anti-discrimination \nprotections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n4.  Plaintiffs are individuals and a nonprofit organization whose members and \nconstituents will be directly impacted by H.B. 2.  Like the three transgender plaintiffs in \nthe case, transgender people around the state of North Carolina immediately suffered \nharm under H.B. 2 in that they are not able to access public restrooms and other single-\nsex facilities that accord with their gender identity.  Additionally, all LGBT people are \nharmed by H.B. 2 in that it strips them of, or bars them from, anti-discrimination \nprotections under local law.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that H.B. 2 violates \ntheir or their members’ constitutional and statutory rights to equal protection, liberty, \ndignity, autonomy, and privacy, as well as an injunction preliminarily and permanently \nenjoining enforcement by of H.B. 2 by Defendants. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs. \n5.  Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño (“Mr. Carcaño”) is a 27-year-old man who \nresides in Carrboro, North Carolina.

It has approximately 8,500 members in the State of North \nCarolina, including LGBT members.  The mission of the ACLU of NC is to defend and \nadvance the individual freedoms embodied in the United States Constitution, including \nthe rights of LGBT people to be free from invidious discrimination and infringements on \ntheir liberty interests.  The ACLU of NC sues on behalf of its members, some of whom \nare transgender individuals who are barred by H.B. 2 from using restrooms and other \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 4 of 57\n\n \nfacilities in accordance with their gender identity in schools (including those subject to \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-521.2) and government buildings, and some of whom are lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, or transgender individuals who have been stripped of or barred from local \nnon-discrimination protections based on their sexual orientation and sex, including \ngender identity.  \nB.  Defendants. \n11.  Defendant Patrick McCrory (“Defendant McCrory” or “Governor \nMcCrory” or “the Governor”) is sued in his official capacity as the Governor of North \nCarolina.  Pursuant to Article III, Section 1 of the State Constitution, “the executive \npower of the State” is vested in Defendant McCrory in his capacity as Governor.  Article \nIII, Section 5(4) also provides that it is the duty of Defendant McCrory in his capacity as \nGovernor to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”  Governor McCrory is a \nperson within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and was acting under color of state law at \nall times relevant to this complaint. \n12.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance.  Defendant University of North Carolina includes \nits constituent institutions, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University \nof North Carolina at Greensboro, and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts \nHigh School. \n13.  Defendant Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina (“the \nBoard”) is a corporate body charged with the general control, supervision, and \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 5 of 57\n\n \ngovernance of the University of North Carolina’s constituent institutions.  The Board is \ncapable of being sued in “all courts whatsoever” pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 116-3. \n14.  Defendant W. Louis Bissette, Jr. (“Defendant Bissette” or “Mr. Bissette”) is \nsued in his official capacity as the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the University \nof North Carolina and has the power to ensure the Board’s compliance with any \ninjunctive relief.   \n15.  Defendants, through their respective duties and obligations, are responsible \nfor enforcing H.B. 2.  Each Defendant, and those subject to their direction, supervision, \nor control, has or intentionally will perform, participate in, aide and/or abet in some \nmanner the acts alleged in this complaint, has or will proximately cause the harm alleged \nherein, and has or will continue to injure Plaintiffs irreparably if not enjoined.  \nAccordingly, the relief requested herein is sought against each Defendant, as well as all \npersons under their supervision, direction, or control, including, but not limited to, their \nofficers, employees, and agents. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution and under Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”). \n17.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under \nlaws of the United States and the United States Constitution. \n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 6 of 57\n\n \n18.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) because \nDefendant University of North Carolina resides within the District, and all Defendants \nreside within the State of North Carolina; and because a substantial part of the events that \ngave rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims took place within the District. \n19.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n20.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are \ndomiciled in North Carolina. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nA.  Plaintiffs. \n \n21.  Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño works for the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill (“UNC-Chapel Hill”) Institute for Global Health and Infectious Disease as a \nProject Coordinator.  The project that he coordinates provides medical education and \nservices such as HIV testing to the Latino/a population.   \n22.  Mr. Carcaño is a man.  \n23.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. Carcaño was recognized and treated like \nall other men at his job at UNC-Chapel Hill.  \n24.  Mr. Carcaño is transgender.  What that means is that his sex assigned at \nbirth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately \nreflect his gender identity, which is male.  \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 7 of 57\n\n \n25.  A person’s gender identity refers to the person’s internal sense of belonging \nto a particular gender.  There is a medical consensus that gender identity is innate and \nthat efforts to change a person’s gender identity are unethical and harmful to a person’s \nhealth and well-being. \n26.  The gender marker on a birth certificate is designated at the time of birth \ngenerally based upon the appearance of external genitalia.  However, determinations of \nsex can involve multiple factors, such as chromosomes, hormone levels, internal and \nexternal reproductive organs, and gender identity.   \n27.  Gender identity is the primary determinant of sex. \n28.  Mr. Carcaño was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical diagnosis \nfor the clinically significant distress that individuals whose gender identity differs from \nthe sex they were assigned at birth can experience. \n29.  Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that, if left untreated, can \nlead to clinical distress, debilitating depression, and even suicidal thoughts and acts.   \n30.  Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized in the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth ed. (2013) \n(DSM-V), and by the other leading medical and mental health professional groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association and the American Psychological \nAssociation. \n31.  Medical treatment for gender dysphoria must be individualized for the \nmedical needs of each patient.  \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 8 of 57\n\n \n32.  Treatment for gender dysphoria includes living one’s life consistent with \none’s gender identity, including when accessing single-sex spaces such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  \n33.  Forcing a transgender person to use single-sex spaces that do not match the \nperson’s gender identity is inconsistent with medical protocols and can cause anxiety and \ndistress to the transgender person and result in harassment of and violence against them.  \n34.  Mr. Carcaño was born and raised in South Texas.  Since a very young age, \naround 7 or 8 years old, Mr. Carcaño was aware that he did not feel like a girl, but he did \nnot know how to express how he felt. \n35.  Mr. Carcaño ultimately acknowledged his male gender identity to himself \nlater in his adult life. \n36.  Since 2013, Mr. Carcaño has been in the continuous care of a licensed \nmental health clinician, who diagnosed Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria.  Mr. Carcaño \ninitially sought treatment for depression, which was caused in part by his gender \ndysphoria. \n37.  Mental health and medical professionals worldwide recognize and follow \nthe evidence-based standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria developed by \nthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”).  After \ndiagnosing Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria, his therapist developed a course of \ntreatment consistent with those standards.  The goal of such treatment is to alleviate \ndistress by helping a person live congruently with the person’s gender identity, the \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 9 of 57\n\n \nprimary determinant of sex.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in January \n2015, Mr. Carcaño explained to his family and friends that he is a man. \n38.  A critical component of the WPATH Standards of Care is a social transition \nto living full-time consistently with the individual’s gender identity.  For Mr. Carcaño, \nthat includes living in accordance with his gender identity in all respects, including the \nuse of a male name and pronouns and use of the men’s restrooms. \n39.  For transgender people, it is critical that social transition include transition \nin the workplace, including with respect to restrooms.  Excluding a transgender man from \nthe restroom that corresponds to his gender identity, or forcing him to use a separate \nfacility from other men, communicates to the entire workplace that he should not be \nrecognized as a man and undermines the social transition process. \n40.  Mr. Carcaño also began using Joaquín as his first name in January 2015.  \nHis friends, family, and coworkers now recognize him as a man, and they refer to him \nusing his male name and male pronouns. \n41.  Also consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño’s \nphysician recommended and prescribed hormone treatment, which Mr. Carcaño has \nreceived since May 2015.  For both hormone therapy and surgical treatment, the WPATH \nStandards of Care require persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria, which is a \ncriterion that Mr. Carcaño satisfied.  Among other therapeutic benefits, the hormone \ntreatment has deepened Mr. Carcaño’s voice, increased his growth of facial hair, and \ngiven him a more masculine appearance.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress Mr. \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 10 of 57\n\n \nCarcaño experienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his \nidentity and helped him to feel more comfortable with who he is.  \n42.  As part of the treatment for his gender dysphoria, Mr. Carcaño also \nobtained a bilateral mastectomy and nipple reconstruction (also known as “top surgery”) \nin January 2016.  Consistent with WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño satisfied the \nrequirement of having a referral from a qualified mental health professional in order to \nobtain the surgical treatment. \n43.  As part of his social transition, Mr. Carcaño began using the men’s \nrestroom at work and elsewhere in late 2015, which occurred without incident for the five \nmonths or so before H.B. 2’s enactment.  Mr. Carcaño’s therapist had also specifically \nrecommended that he use only the men’s restroom.  She was concerned that using the \nwomen’s restroom could compromise his mental health, well-being, and safety.  By late \n2015, Mr. Carcaño had facial hair facilitated by hormone treatment, and his therapist \nindicated that others would recognize Mr. Carcaño as a man based on his physical \nappearance. \n44.  Mr. Carcaño is now comfortable with the status of his treatment and, with \nthe exception of the distress now caused by the passage of H.B. 2, his distress has been \nmanaged through the clinically recommended treatment he has received.  He plans to \ncontinue treatment under the supervision of medical professionals and based on his \nmedical needs.  \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 11 of 57\n\n \n45.  Apart from the building where he works, Mr. Carcaño also used other \nmen’s restrooms on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus without incident for approximately \nfive months prior to H.B. 2’s passage.  In addition, when out in public, such as at \nrestaurants and stores, Mr. Carcaño uses the men’s restroom. \n46.  The only restrooms on the floor where Mr. Carcaño works at UNC-Chapel \nHill are designated either for men or for women.  H.B. 2 thus excludes him from using \nthe same restrooms that his coworkers typically use.  This exclusion is stigmatizing and \nmarks him as different and lesser than other men. \n47.  Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. Carcaño, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. Carcaño to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment.  \n48.  The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. Carcaño to \nexperience significant anxiety, as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n49.  In the initial period after H.B. 2’s passage, Mr. Carcaño generally used a \nsingle-occupancy restroom not designated either for men or for women in another \nbuilding on campus, which was approximately a 10-15 minute walk away from his \nbuilding each way.   \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 12 of 57\n\n \n50.  Mr. Carcaño was subsequently informed by administrative staff in the \nbuilding where he works that they had learned of a single-occupancy restroom based on \nbuilding floor plans.  It is accessible using a special service elevator, and the restroom is \ntucked away in a cubby down a hallway in a part of the building used for housekeeping. \n51.  Mr. Carcaño is not only humiliated by being singled out and forced to use a \nseparate restroom from his colleagues and all other men that he works with, but also \nburdened by having to use a separate restroom on a different floor, which increases the \nlikelihood that he will delay or avoid going to the restroom.  \n52.  Mr. Carcaño also visits public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, as part of his job \nat UNC-Chapel Hill, Mr. Carcaño has had to visit the offices of the North Carolina \nDepartment of Health and Human Services many times in the past, and he will continue \nto need to do so in the future.  Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, he used the men’s restroom \nwhile at their office, but he will be banned from doing so in the future under H.B. 2. \n53.  Similarly, Mr. Carcaño has visited state courthouses in Chapel Hill as part \nof a process to obtain a name change from his current legal name, which includes a \ntraditionally feminine first name, to the name he currently uses.  Because that name \nchange process is ongoing, Mr. Carcaño will continue to visit state courthouses in the \nfuture, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom there under H.B. 2. \n54.  Mr. Carcaño has also visited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 13 of 57\n\n \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future, where he will be banned from using \nthe men’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n55.  Mr. Carcaño also regularly uses the North Carolina Rest Area System, \nwhich maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation.  For example, he uses the restrooms provided by that \nsystem when he travels approximately once a month to visit his brother in Atlanta, and \nwhen he visits Washington, D.C. periodically.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n56.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. Carcaño’s knowledge, \ncomplaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n57.  Mr. Carcaño is currently in the process of pursuing and exhausting \nadministrative remedies before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with \nrespect to his rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n58.  Mr. Carcaño is a member of the ACLU of NC.   \n59.  Plaintiff Payton Grey McGarry is a full-time student at the University of \nNorth Carolina at Greensboro (“UNC-Greensboro”), where he is double majoring in \nBusiness Administration and Accounting.  He is also a skilled musician and has played \ntrumpet in many ensembles at UNC-Greensboro.  He plays the guitar, baritone, clarinet, \nand saxophone. \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 14 of 57\n\n \n60.  Mr. McGarry is close to his family and has a younger brother who is also a \nmember of the LGBT community.  Mr. McGarry hopes to use his education to eventually \ngo to law school and work to defend people’s civil rights. \n61.  Mr. McGarry is a man.  \n62.  Mr. McGarry is transgender.  As is true for Mr. Carcaño, Mr. McGarry’s \nsex assigned at birth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does \nnot conform to his gender identity, which is male.   \n63.  Mr. McGarry was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n64.  Mr. McGarry was born and raised in Wilson, North Carolina.  Throughout \nhis childhood, Mr. McGarry felt like a boy and never really thought of himself as a girl.  \nIt was not until he started to go through puberty that he began to wrestle with the \ndisconnect between his identity as a boy and his assigned birth sex.  \n65.  Mr. McGarry realized while he was in high school that he is transgender. \n66.  In October 2013, during his senior year in high school, Mr. McGarry began \nmental health treatment with a licensed clinical social worker who diagnosed him with \ngender dysphoria.  \n67.  After diagnosing Mr. McGarry with gender dysphoria, his therapist \ndeveloped a course of treatment in accordance with medical standards for treating the \ncondition.   \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 15 of 57\n\n \n68.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in the fall and winter of \n2013, Mr. McGarry explained to his friends and family that he is male and began to use \nmale pronouns.  \n69.  In April 2014, under the care of an endocrinologist, Mr. McGarry began \nhormone therapy.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress that Mr. McGarry \nexperienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his identity and \nhelped him to feel more comfortable with who he is. \n70.  By the time he graduated high school in June 2014, Mr. McGarry used the \nname Payton and male pronouns in all aspects of his life.  He is known as Payton \nMcGarry to his family, friends, and peers, although he has not yet changed his legal first \nname to Payton. \n71.  In the fall of 2014, Mr. McGarry enrolled as a freshman at UNC-\nGreensboro as Payton McGarry and as male. \n72.  Since arriving at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. McGarry has identified and has \nbeen known to others as male for all purposes. \n73.  Mr. McGarry is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity, \nand is the Vice President of the Iota Epsilon Chapter of that fraternity.  His fraternity \nbrothers are aware that he is transgender and have no concerns with his use of men’s \nrestrooms and locker rooms. \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 16 of 57\n\n \n74.  Though Mr. McGarry currently lives off campus, he is on campus six or \nseven days per week and always uses the restroom designed for men in on-campus \nbuildings. \n75.  Mr. McGarry regularly uses the locker room facilities at UNC-Greensboro \nand always uses the facilities designed for men.  \n76.  For the past year and a half since he enrolled at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. \nMcGarry has used the men’s restrooms and locker rooms on-campus without incident.  \nMr. McGarry is unaware of any instance in which any person has complained about his \nuse of the men’s restroom or locker room.  \n77.  Mr. McGarry works part-time as a visual technician for marching bands at \ndifferent high schools around the state and regularly uses the bathroom for men when \nworking as a visual technician.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. \nMcGarry’s knowledge, complaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n78.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, Mr. \nMcGarry always uses the men’s restroom. \n79.  To Mr. McGarry’s knowledge, there are very few single-user restrooms on \nthe UNC-Greensboro campus, and there are no single-user bathrooms in many buildings \nwhere he has classes. \n80.  If Mr. McGarry could not use the men’s restroom at UNC-Greensboro, he \nwould have to search for single-user restrooms outside of the buildings where his classes \nare held every time he had to use the restroom.  This would disrupt his ability to attend \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 17 of 57\n\n \nclass and would interfere with his educational opportunities.  Expelling him from the \nmultiple occupancy restrooms and locker rooms available to all other male students is \nstigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than other men. \n81.  Since he started testosterone two years ago, Mr. McGarry’s voice has \ndeepened and his face and body have become more traditionally masculine in \nappearance. \n82.  Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. McGarry, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. McGarry to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment. \n83.  The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. McGarry to \nexperience significant anxiety, as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n84.  Since the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. McGarry has been barred from using the \nmen’s restrooms on campus.  Given that he cannot use the women’s restroom and there \nare only a few available single-user restrooms, he often avoids going to the restroom all \nday.  \n85.  Mr. McGarry has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, Mr. McGarry has \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 18 of 57\n\n \nvisited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s license) and anticipates doing \nso again in the future, where he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n86.  Mr. McGarry also has used and will continue to use the North Carolina \nRest Area System, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by \nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n87.  Plaintiff H.S. is a junior at the University of North Carolina School of the \nArts High School (“UNCSA-HS”).  The oldest of four children, she is close to her family, \nwho love and support her.  She is an accomplished artist and studies visual arts at \nUNCSA-HS. \n88.  H.S. is a girl. \n89.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. was recognized as a girl at school and \nwhen out in public. \n90.  H.S. is transgender.  She was assigned the sex of male at birth, as her birth \ncertificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately reflect her gender identity, \nwhich is female. \n91.  H.S. has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 19 of 57\n\n \n92.  H.S. was born in New Jersey but moved to North Carolina when she was 11 \nyears old.  From as young an age two or three, H.S. gravitated towards clothing and toys \ngenerally associated with girls.  Like many other girls, she would always want to wear \nthe pink princess dresses at pre-school and to play with Barbie dolls. \n93.  After completing pre-school, H.S. did not feel comfortable expressing her \nidentity as a girl and tried to immerse herself in traditionally masculine spaces and \nactivities.  She tried to do things that she felt she was supposed to do as a boy.  But \nnothing felt right. \n94.  Starting in seventh grade, H.S. again began to gravitate toward clothes and \nactivities that were considered more feminine. \n95.  By eighth grade, H.S. again began to express a more stereotypically \nfeminine gender and at times would wear makeup and high-heel shoes at school. \n96.  As puberty began to approach in ninth grade, severe gender dysphoria and \nanxiety began to hit H.S., and she experienced significant distress around her body and \nidentity.  She finally went to her parents, who recognized that she was suffering. \n97.  In ninth grade, H.S. began therapy with an expert on treating transgender \nyoung people and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n98.  In 2013, H.S. started high school at Broughton High School in Raleigh.  In \nthe middle of her freshman year, H.S. began hormone blockers to prevent the onset of \nmale puberty and the development of secondary sex characteristics associated with men. \nThis treatment delayed puberty while H.S. continued to understand her female identity.  \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 20 of 57\n\n \nThough H.S. continued to experience some distress and dysphoria, the hormone blockers \ngreatly reduced her suffering. \n99.  At the end of ninth grade, H.S. felt fully comfortable embracing her identity \nas a girl at school and had the full support of her parents.  On the last day of school her \nfreshman year, H.S. wore a skirt to school that her mother had purchased for her.  It was \nan important and symbolic turning point in her comfort with and embrace of her identity \nas a girl. \n100.  By sophomore year, H.S. was perceived as a girl and began to use the girls’ \nbathroom at school and in public.  She was also known by female pronouns—such as she, \nher, and hers—by this time. \n101.  During her sophomore year, H.S. was elected to the Queen’s Court at her \nschool, an honor that had, in the seventy-five years of the tradition, been shared only \namong non-transgender girls.  \n102.  Under the care of her endocrinologist, during her sophomore year in high \nschool, H.S. continued to assess her medical treatment for gender dysphoria and began to \nconsider hormone replacement therapy.  At the end of her sophomore year, in the spring \nof 2015, H.S. began estrogen therapy to continue her medical transition. \n103.  An accomplished visual artist, H.S. applied to the UNCSA-HS for her \njunior year and was accepted. \n104.  In the fall of 2015, H.S. moved to Winston-Salem to attend UNCSA-HS as \na boarding student.  She studies visual arts and aspires to a career in fashion. \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 21 of 57\n\n \n105.  H.S. lives in the girls’ dormitory at UNCSA-HS. \n106.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. exclusively used the girls’ restroom at \nschool and could not imagine ever using a restroom designated for boys.  H.S. is unaware \nof any instance in which any person has complained about her use of the girls’ restroom.  \n107.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, H.S. uses \nthe restrooms designated for women and girls. \n108.  Outside of H.S.’s dorm room, there are no single-user restrooms available \nto her at UNCSA-HS and it would be disruptive to H.S.’s education to have to avoid the \nuse of the restroom or to return to her room or locate a single-user restroom off campus \nevery time she needed to go to the restroom. \n109.  Forcing H.S. out of spaces shared with her female peers is stigmatizing and \nmarks her as different and lesser than other girls at school. \n110.  Particularly because she never went through puberty as a boy and began \nestrogen treatment earlier this year, H.S. has a traditionally feminine appearance.  She is \nrecognized as female in all aspects of her life. \n111.  Using the boys’ or men’s restroom is not a viable option for H.S., just as it \nwould not be a viable option for non-transgender women and girls to be forced to use the \nrestrooms designated for men and boys.  Forcing H.S. to use the restroom designated for \nmen and boys would also cause substantial harm to her mental health and well-being and \nwould put her in danger of harassment and violence.  It would also force her to disclose \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 22 of 57\n\n \nto others the fact that she is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment. \n112.  The idea of being forced into the restroom designated for boys and men at \nschool and in public causes H.S. to experience significant anxiety and brings up painful \nmemories and anxiety from her earlier childhood.  She fears for her safety because of the \npassage of H.B. 2.  \n113.  Since the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. has limited or delayed use of the \nbathroom because of fear of reprisals if she uses the restroom designated for women and \ngirls and because she fears for her safety if she uses the restroom designated for men and \nboys, as the law requires.  \n114.  H.S. has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-\n760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, H.S. has visited the \nDivision of Motor Vehicles under the North Carolina Department of Transportation on \nprior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s license) and anticipates doing so again in the \nfuture, where she will be banned from using the women’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n115.  H.S. has used and will continue to use the North Carolina Rest Area \nSystem, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation.  She will need to continue to use those restrooms \nin the future, but she will be banned from using the women’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n116.  Plaintiff Angela Gilmore is a resident of Durham, North Carolina.  \nMs. Gilmore has lived in North Carolina since 2011, when she moved from Florida to \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 23 of 57\n\n \ntake a job at North Carolina Central University.  She is currently the Associate Dean for \nAcademic Affairs and Professor of Law at North Carolina Central University.   \n117.  Ms. Gilmore is a lesbian, and has been in a relationship with her wife, \nAngela Wallace, for almost twenty years.  Ms. Gilmore and Ms. Wallace were married in \nWashington, D.C. in 2014.  \n118.  Ms. Gilmore looked for and accepted a job in North Carolina, after she and \nher wife fell in love with the state during a visiting teaching job Ms. Gilmore had at Elon \nUniversity School of Law in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2010.   \n119.  Both Ms. Gilmore and her wife, African American lesbians, felt that North \nCarolina, and Durham in particular, was a place where they could be fully themselves, \ncomfortable in terms of both their race and sexual orientation.   \n120.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife love living in Durham—they feel very much part \nof the community—and prior to the passage of H.B. 2, they had been looking at small \ntowns in North Carolina where they might want to retire. \n121.  Since moving to North Carolina, Ms. Gilmore has worked towards \nincreasing non-discrimination protections for LGBT people.  Ms. Gilmore is a member of \nthe ACLU of NC, and she was on the ACLU of NC board between 2014 and 2015.  \nDuring that time, the ACLU of NC actively worked to defeat anti-LGBT bills proposed \nin the state legislature and to pass local ordinances, like the Ordinance, and to protect \nLGBT people from discrimination at the local level.  Ms. Gilmore also has spoken on \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 24 of 57\n\n \npanels at her law school and other law schools regarding non-discrimination protections \nfor LGBT people. \n122.  The passage of H.B. 2 has caused Ms. Gilmore and her wife distress, in that \nit has significantly undone their sense of belonging and value in the state, which is why \nthey moved to North Carolina.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife experience H.B. 2 as sending a \nclear message to them as lesbians that they are not welcome in North Carolina. \n123.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife have visited the City of Charlotte and they plan \nto do so in the future.  As two women traveling together with the same first name, they \nare often asked about the nature of their relationship, and they therefore regularly reveal \nthemselves to be a lesbian couple.  Under the Ordinance, Ms. Gilmore and her wife \nwould have been protected from sexual orientation discrimination in public \naccommodations in the City of Charlotte.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore \nworries that she and her wife will now be exposed to discrimination based on their sexual \norientation. \n124.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore also is limited in her ability to \nincrease and benefit from non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in North \nCarolina.  Were she able to, Ms. Gilmore would continue to advocate for local ordinances \nthat prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n125.  As a non-transgender woman who always uses the facilities designated for \nwomen in both public and private spaces, Ms. Gilmore does not feel safer in these \nfacilities because of the passage of H.B. 2. \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 25 of 57\n\n \n126.  Plaintiffs Kelly Trent and Beverly Newell are residents of Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina.  Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell met in 2013, and they were married in \nCharlotte in December 2014.   \n127.  As a lesbian couple and as residents of Charlotte, Ms. Trent and \nMs. Newell would have been protected by the Ordinance from discrimination based on \ntheir sexual orientation by public accommodations in Charlotte.  With the passage of \nH.B. 2, public accommodations in Charlotte are now legally permitted to discriminate \nbased on sexual orientation.  Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell fear that they are likely to \nexperience discrimination based on their sexual orientation in Charlotte in the future, \nbased on their recent experience of discrimination on that basis.  \n128.  In February 2016, Ms. Trent reached out to a fertility clinic, the website for \nwhich listed an office in Charlotte, and made an appointment for an initial consult in \nearly April 2016.  Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell are trying to become parents, and they are \nhoping to have Ms. Trent carry a child.  Because they are a lesbian couple, they plan on \nusing donor sperm.  At the time of her contact with the clinic, Ms. Trent made it clear \nthat she and Ms. Newell are a same-sex couple seeking fertility services and that they \nplan on using donor sperm.   \n129.  On April 1, 2016—soon after the passage of H.B. 2—a representative of \nthe clinic called Ms. Trent and cancelled the appointment, claiming that the clinic did not \nserve “single sex couples” or “same sex couples.”  The next week, the clinic’s website \nwas changed to state that the clinic now does not provide services “requiring the use of \n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 26 of 57\n\n \ndonor sperm,” although the clinic does continue to provide services for clients using a \n“husband’s” sperm.  The clinic’s refusal to serve Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell appears to be \nbased on their sexual orientation.   \n130.  The passage of H.B. 2 prevented Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell from being \nable to file a public accommodations discrimination complaint with the City of Charlotte \nCommunity Relations Committee regarding the clinic’s actions, or from having their \ncomplaint investigated or conciliated.  Had H.B. 2 not passed and preempted the \nOrdinance, Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell would have filed such a complaint.  If Ms. Trent \nand Ms. Newell suffer future discrimination based on their sexual orientation in a place \nof public accommodation in Charlotte, they will similarly be denied the ability to avail \nthemselves of the City of Charlotte’s Community Relations Committee procedure for \nreceiving, investigating, or conciliating complaints. \n131.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell are also limited in \ntheir ability to increase and benefit from non-discrimination protections for LGBT people \nin North Carolina.  As residents of Charlotte, Ms. Trent and Ms. Newell supported the \nOrdinance, and were they able to, they would support other local ordinances that prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.   \n132.  As non-transgender women who always use the facilities designated for \nwomen in both public and private spaces, Ms. Trent or Ms. Newell do not feel safer in \nthese facilities because of the passage of H.B. 2. \n   \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 27 of 57\n\n \nB.  The City of Charlotte’s Enactment of a Non-Discrimination \nOrdinance. \n \n133.  Advocates have long worked for the passage of an ordinance that would \nensure that LGBT people were expressly protected from discrimination within the City of \nCharlotte.  Prior to the vote on the Ordinance, there had been an earlier round of intensive \npublic engagement in late 2014 to early 2015, when the Charlotte City Council \npreviously considered expanding non-discrimination protections to include sexual \norientation and gender identity and expression. \n134.  There was again extensive discussion and deliberation leading up to the \nFebruary 2016 vote on the Ordinance.  The Charlotte City Council heard hours of robust \npublic comment in a forum that included hundreds of people—both those who were in \nsupport of the Ordinance and those who were in opposition to the Ordinance.  The \nCharlotte City Council also received significant legal analysis from the Office of the City \nAttorney regarding its authority to enact the Ordinance and the effect of the Ordinance.  \n135.  The impetus for the Ordinance is the reality that LGBT people often face \npervasive discrimination.  Although same-sex couples may now marry throughout the \nUnited States as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell, lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual people remain vulnerable to discrimination in states like North Carolina \nwhere there is no express protection for sexual orientation in state law, making local anti-\ndiscrimination protections even more vital.  Discrimination is especially pervasive for \ntransgender people, as evidenced by a 2011 national study of transgender Americans, \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 28 of 57\n\n \nInjustice at Every Turn, which documented the high levels of harassment, discrimination, \nand violence that transgender people have faced and continue to face. \n136.  In the 2011 national report cited above, 90% of respondents reported being \nharassed at work or taking actions to avoid harassment, while 26% reported being fired \nbecause they are transgender.  Forty-seven percent reported some form of employment \ndiscrimination because they are transgender, including not being hired, not being \npromoted, or being fired.  Fifty-three percent reported being verbally harassed or \ndisrespected in a place of public accommodation, and 22% reported being denied equal \ntreatment by a government agency or official because they are transgender. \n137.  In 2013, it was estimated that there were more than 250,000 LGBT adults \nin North Carolina, out of an adult population of approximately eight million people.  \nAmong this population of North Carolinians, there are an estimated 37,800 transgender \npeople (of any age), including 15,600 individuals who are 13 to 19 years old.  While \ntransgender individuals only make up a small minority of the population, they are \ndisproportionately targeted for hate crimes in the United States. \n138.  On Monday, February 22, 2016, by a 7-to-4 vote, the Charlotte City \nCouncil approved the Ordinance, which, inter alia, amended its existing public \naccommodations protections by barring discrimination in public accommodations based \non “gender identity, gender expression” and “sexual orientation.” \n139.  The City Council’s vote was met with a firestorm of opposition from vocal \nopponents of the part of the Ordinance that would have required certain public \n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 29 of 57\n\n \naccommodations to allow transgender people to use single-sex facilities, such as \nrestrooms and locker rooms, in accordance with their gender identity. \n140.  Opponents of the Ordinance distorted the truth of what the Ordinance’s \nnon-discrimination requirement would accomplish and formed a vocal campaign \ndecrying a purported attempt to permit “men in women’s restrooms.” \nC.  The Events Leading to H.B. 2, Contemporary Statements by \nDecisionmakers, and Departures From the Normal Legislative Process \nRevealed a Series of Official Actions Taken for Invidious Purposes.   \n \n141.  The State of North Carolina has rarely, if ever, exercised authority to \npreempt local ordinances providing broader protections than under state law.  For \nexample, in 1968 Charlotte adopted an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in public \naccommodations on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.  In 1972, the \nCouncil amended the ordinance to prohibit discrimination based on sex, which the \nCouncil further modified in 1985. \n142.  Even though all of these protections extended beyond the reach of the \nState’s public accommodations law, which until H.B. 2 prohibited only public \naccommodations discrimination based on disability, the State allowed Charlotte’s \nordinance to stand undisturbed for decades.  It was only after Charlotte took steps to \nprotect LGBT people that the State rushed to preempt the ordinance. \n143.  Even before the Charlotte City Council had cast its vote on the Ordinance, \nGovernor McCrory informed Charlotte City Council members that the State would likely \ntake immediate action to put a halt to the Ordinance—even as Governor McCrory \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 30 of 57\n\n \nconceded that was an exceedingly unusual step.  In an email to Charlotte City Council \nmembers, Governor McCrory noted that he “made a point as the former 14 year Mayor \nand current Governor to stay out of specific issues being voted on by the Charlotte City \nCouncil.”  Governor McCrory nonetheless characterized the Ordinance’s non-\ndiscrimination protections for LGBT people as “changing basic long-established values \nand norms” surrounding “public restrooms,” and he ominously warned of “possible \ndanger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  \nGovernor McCrory said that the Ordinance would “most likely cause immediate State \nlegislative intervention which I would support as governor.”    \n144.  On Tuesday, February 23, 2016, the Speaker of the North Carolina House \nof Representatives, Tim Moore (“Speaker Moore”), issued a press release announcing \nthat he would work with fellow Republicans to explore a “legislative intervention to \ncorrect [Charlotte’s] radical course.” \n145.  In North Carolina, it is the state’s Governor who typically calls a special \nsession, but in this case, Governor McCrory refused to call a special session because he \nwas concerned that the legislature would go beyond addressing the Charlotte Ordinance. \n146.  As a result of the Governor’s refusal to call a special session, legislative \nleaders opted for a rarely used law that allows special sessions when three-fifths of \nlegislators in both chambers support the call.  That provision in the state constitution had \nnot been used since 1981, according to Lt. Governor Dan Forest’s chief of staff, Hal \nWeatherman.  The special session cost approximately $42,000 to convene.   \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 31 of 57\n\n \n147.  The text of H.B. 2, which was named the “Public Facilities Privacy and \nSecurity Act,” was not shared with most legislators until they arrived to debate the bill. \n148.  North Carolina House of Representatives Minority Leader Larry Hall \n(“Minority Leader Hall”) stated “We don’t know what we’re discussing here, we don’t \nknow what we’re voting on.  What we’re doing is a perversion of the process.” \n149.  Minority Leader Hall said that Democrats were initially told that the special \nsession would take place on Thursday, March 24, 2016, when instead the special session \nwas held on March 23, 2016.  Minority Leader Hall stated that, as a result, a number of \nlegislators were “caught off guard” and were “scrambling to try to come back” for the \nsession. \n150.  The special session, which lasted a single day, was substantially shorter \nthan previous special sessions.  Before H.B. 2 had been filed, Speaker Moore announced \nthat the committee hearing for the bill would begin five minutes after introduction of the \nbill and adjournment of the morning session.  Shortly thereafter, approximately twelve \nminutes after the House came to order, H.B. 2 was filed—the first time it was officially \nmade available to the public or the legislators.   \n151.  Approximately three minutes after H.B. 2 was filed, the chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary IV Committee—the committee to which H.B. 2 was assigned—stated, in \nresponse to a fellow member’s question, that it was his “intention” to permit time for \npublic comment on the bill during the committee hearing.  Upon information and belief, \nno prior public notice of the time and place for public comment on H.B. 2 was provided. \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 32 of 57\n\n \n152.  Only forty-five minutes were allotted for public comment, which was \ninsufficient to permit those who had signed up to speak on H.B. 2 to be heard. \n153.  In response to complaints during the committee hearing that members had \nnot been given an opportunity to read the text of H.B. 2, the chairman permitted a five-\nminute break to allow members to read the bill. \n154.  After a favorable referral from the House Judiciary IV Committee, H.B. 2 \nreceived only three hours of debate in the House, after which it was passed and referred \nto the Senate. \n155.  The roll call for H.B. 2 in the Senate was called after all Democratic \nmembers of the Senate walked out of the chambers in protest, with North Carolina State \nSenate Democratic Leader Dan Blue calling the special session an “affront to democracy” \nand stating that the Democratic caucus in the Senate “choose[s] not to participate in this \nfarce.”  With every Democratic member absent, the Senate passed H.B. 2 unanimously. \n156.  Comments made by lawmakers both during the debate, in the press, and \nthrough their social media used vitriolic language to make clear their aim at undoing \nCharlotte’s protections for LGBT people: \na.  North Carolina State Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger’s \ndescriptions of the legislature’s work included:   \ni.  “Senate unanimously votes to stop radical ordinance allowing \nmen into public bathrooms with women and young girls.” \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 33 of 57\n\n \nii.  “Lawmakers were forced to come back to session to address \nthe serious safety concerns created by the dangerous ordinance—which violated existing \nstate criminal trespass law, indecent exposure law and building codes and created a \nloophole that any man with nefarious motives could use to prey on women and young \nchildren . . .” \niii.  “How many fathers are now going to be forced to go to the \nladies’ room to make sure their little girls aren’t molested?” \nb.  North Carolina State Senator Buck Newton said, “The Charlotte City \nCouncil should have never passed this unlawful and reckless bathroom and locker room \nordinance.  Politics have reached a new extreme when a municipality’s top priority is \nallowing men into women’s bathrooms and locker rooms.  But tens of thousands of our \nconstituents from across the state have called on us to stand up to the political correctness \nmob, fight for common sense and put a stop to this nonsense once and for all.” \nc.  North Carolina State Senator David Curtis (“Senator Curtis”) said, \n“This liberal group is trying to redefine everything about our society.  Gender and \nmarriage — just the whole liberal agenda.”  Senator Curtis added that while, “We \ngenerally don’t get involved in local politics.  We need to do what’s right.”  Senator \nCurtis said that H.B. 2 was necessary because, “The gays would go into a business, make \nsome outrageous demand that they know the owner cannot comply with and file a lawsuit \nagainst that business owner and put him out of business.”  Senator Curtis suggested that \nH.B. 2 was broadly drafted specifically for the purpose of defending the bathroom \n34 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 34 of 57\n\n \nprovision it in court: “[w]e feel like we can successfully defend the law and the fact that \nwe made the law much broader,” explaining that “[i]n addition to the bathroom issue we \nrestricted the rights of cities and towns to impose a higher minimum wage.  The bill has \nto do with restricting rights of cities and counties.  I suspect we will defend it based on \nthat.” \nd.  North Carolina State Senator Andrew Brock said, “You know, \n$42,000 is not going to cover the medical expenses when a pervert walks into a bathroom \nand my little girls are in there.”  \ne.  Speaker Moore said “They want to protect adults who feel \ncompelled to dress up like the opposite sex.  I, on the other hand, oppose the ordinance to \nprotect children, who from the time they’ve been potty trained, know to go into the \nbathroom of their god given appropriate gender.  Honestly, it’s ridiculous we are even \nhaving this discussion.  I look forward to invalidating this ordinance as soon as possible.” \nf.  North Carolina State Representative Mark Brody said Charlotte’s \nordinance “violates my Christian values and it violates decency values,” adding that he \n“had to stop it.”  Representative Brody further stated that “[t]he homosexual community \nhas just stepped too far and that had to stop and that’s my basic opinion,” noting that \n“[t]his is driven by the homosexual community and they’re emboldened by their victory \nin the courts on homosexual marriage.”  Brody elaborated further that H.B. 2 “sends a \nmessage to these municipalities who have been taken over by the liberal, homosexual, \n35 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 35 of 57\n\n \nprohomosexual ideology that we are going to stick up for traditional values and we’ll \nstick up for them constantly if that’s what we have to do.” \ng.  North Carolina State Representative John Blust opined that he \n“think[s] it’s ridiculous that your anatomy isn’t what governs what restroom you use,” \nadding that he does not “understand why they have to make way for this .0001 percent of \nthe population.” \n157.  Debate in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly focused \nspecifically on reversing the Charlotte Ordinance, with lawmakers in both chambers \ncondemning the anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people, including transgender \nindividuals’ right to use facilities in accordance with their gender identity.   \n158.  Fewer than 10 hours after it was introduced, the bill passed both houses.  \nGovernor McCrory signed the bill that same night, issuing a signing statement making \nclear once again the targets of H.B. 2.  His signing statement said, “This radical breach of \ntrust and security under the false argument of equal access not only impacts the citizens \nof Charlotte but people who come to Charlotte to work, visit or play.  This new \ngovernment regulation defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, \nfor example, a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.”  H.B. 2 took \neffect immediately.   \nD.  H.B. 2 Harms Transgender People. \n159.  H.B. 2 amended North Carolina’s General Statutes to mandate that school \nboards require students to use restrooms and other single-sex facilities in accordance with \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 36 of 57\n\n \ntheir “biological sex” providing that,  \nLocal boards of education shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used \nonly by students based on their biological sex. \n \n160.  H.B. 2 also imposes the same mandate on all executive branch agencies \n(which are expressly defined to include Defendant University of North Carolina), and all \npublic agencies, providing that they \nshall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be \ndesignated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex.   \n \n161.  Each of those provisions defines “biological sex” as follows, \n \nBiological sex. – The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated \non a person’s birth certificate.  \n \n162.  Changing the gender marker on one’s birth certificate is not a viable option \nfor many transgender people, as every jurisdiction has a different set of often onerous and \nunnecessary requirements for updating the gender listed on a birth certificate. \n163.  For instance, a person born in North Carolina can only update the gender \nmarker listed on a North Carolina-issued birth certificate with proof of certain surgeries \nthat may not be medically necessary, advisable, or affordable for any given person.  \nMeanwhile, a person born in neighboring Tennessee can never change the gender listed \non a Tennessee-issued birth certificate. \n164.  Medical treatment such as the surgery required to update a person’s North \nCarolina birth certificate does not alter a person’s gender (or what H.B. 2 calls \n“biological sex”), but rather merely brings a person’s body into alignment with the \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 37 of 57\n\n \ngender they have always been.  Gender identity is instead the chief determinant of a \nperson’s gender.  \n165.  H.B. 2’s provisions requiring use of single-sex facilities in accordance with \nthe sex stated on their birth certificate not only disproportionately burdens transgender \npeople, but intentionally targets them for differential treatment.  Lawmakers made clear \nthat H.B. 2 was specifically aimed at transgender people.  For example, an FAQ released \nby Governor McCrory after H.B. 2’s enactment states, “Why did North Carolina pass this \nlaw in the first place?  Answer:  The bill was passed after the Charlotte City Council \nvoted to impose a regulation requiring businesses to allow a man into a women’s \nrestroom, shower, or locker room if they choose,” even though it does not do that, but \nonly allows a transgender woman to use a women’s restroom or other multiple user \nfacility for women and a transgender man to use a men’s restroom or other multiple user \nfacility for men.  \n166.  Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, it was already illegal for a person to enter a \nrestroom or locker room to assault or injure another.  Moreover, protecting transgender \npeople from discrimination in public accommodations, as has been done in numerous \nstates and hundreds of localities, has resulted in no increase in public safety incidents in \nany jurisdiction anywhere in the United States, and including transgender people in \npublic life in no way impacts the safety or well-being of non-transgender people. \n167.  The painful message of stigma sent by H.B. 2 echoes the dehumanizing \nrhetoric employed by a number of lawmakers, suggesting that transgender people are \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 38 of 57\n\n \nsomehow predatory or dangerous to others.  In fact, it is H.B. 2 that exposes transgender \npeople to harassment and potential violence.  Transgender people are already \ndisproportionately targeted for physical violence and harassment in North Carolina and \nacross the country.  When a transgender person is forced to disclose their transgender \nstatus to strangers, such disclosure puts them at a high risk for violence.  H.B. 2’s \nrequirement that transgender people be shunted into single-sex spaces that do not match \ntheir gender identity invades their privacy and exposes this vulnerable population to \nharassment and potential violence by others. \n168.  Upon information and belief, after the enactment of H.B. 2, some school \nofficials that had been respecting their students’ gender identity without any problem \ncalled parents to say that their children would be forced out of the single-sex facilities \nthat match their gender identity.   \n169.  H.B. 2’s broad sweep means that the same result applies to executive and \npublic agencies, including routine places such as libraries, public health centers, airports, \nand the Division of Motor Vehicles, as well as places where people may turn in times of \ncrisis, such as state hospitals, police departments, and courthouses.  Transgender \nindividuals working in such agencies may not be able to safely use any bathroom any \nlonger, threatening their ability to keep their job. \n170.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, the City Attorney of the City of \nCharlotte issued a memorandum dated April 1, 2016 to the Mayor and City Council of \nthe City of Charlotte, regarding the effect of H.B. 2 on the Ordinance and other city laws \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 39 of 57\n\n \nor policies.  The memorandum noted that H.B. 2 “invalidates . . . the February 22 \namendments to the public accommodations ordinance,” and concluded that “[d]ue to the \npreemption described above, the Community Relations Committee can no longer receive, \ninvestigate, and conciliate complaints for violations of the public accommodations \nordinance.”  The memorandum also expressed uncertainty regarding whether H.B. 2 \npreempted the city’s non-discrimination protections for city employees. \n171.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, the University of North Carolina \nPresident issued a memorandum dated April 5, 2016 to chancellors of constituent UNC \nschools, including UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC-Greensboro, and UNCSA-HS.  The \nmemorandum specifically states that “University institutions must require every multiple-\noccupancy bathroom and changing facility to be designated for and used only by persons \nbased on their biological sex.”  The memorandum included a copy of H.B. 2, which \nincludes its definition of “biological sex.” \n172.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, Governor McCrory issued Executive \nOrder No. 93, dated April 12, 2016.  The order affirmed that “[u]nder current law, every \nmultiple occupancy restroom, locker room, or shower facility located in a cabinet agency \nmust be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex,” and that \n“restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities in public buildings, including our \nschools” would be maintained by the State “on the basis of biological sex.”  In a press \nrelease and video statement accompanying Executive Order No. 93, the governor stated \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 40 of 57\n\n \nthat the Executive Order “[m]aintains . . . gender-specific restroom and locker room \nfacilities in government buildings and schools.”  \n173.  Executive Order No. 93 required that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-760 (H.B. 2, \nSection 1.3) be interpreted consistent with the following guidance: “[w]hen a private \nentity leases State real property and the property in the lessee’s exclusive possession \nincludes multiple occupancy restrooms, locker rooms or other like facilities, the private \nentity will control the signage and use of these facilities.”   \n174.  Executive Order No. 93 also sought to clarify the ambiguity regarding the \nscope of preemption provision noted by the City Attorney of the City of Charlotte, stating \nthat “N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-422.2(c) permits local governments or other political \nsubdivisions of the State to set their own employment policies applicable to their own \npersonnel,” and affirming that “local governments may establish their own non-\ndiscrimination employment practices.” \n175.  H.B. 2’s restroom ban also deters transgender people from participating in \nthe state and local democratic process.  It bans them from using the restroom consistent \nwith their gender identity when visiting the North Carolina General Assembly, \npetitioning their legislator, or entering any building operated by the legislative branch.  It \nalso bans them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity at a city \ncouncil meeting or at a mayor’s office. \n176.  H.B. 2’s harms extend even farther, creating conflicts between state law \nand various federal laws.  The conflict with Title IX, for example, puts at risk the more \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 41 of 57\n\n \nthan $4.5 billion in federal education funding that North Carolina is expected to receive \nin 2016.  H.B. 2 also could lead to financial penalties under Executive Order 11246, \nwhich prohibits federal contractors (such as the University of North Carolina) from \nbarring transgender employees from the restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  \nIn addition, public employers subject to Title VII will violate the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission’s decree that discriminating against transgender people with \nrespect to restroom use is impermissible sex discrimination.  Public hospitals that receive \nfederal funding also will violate Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act if they comply \nwith H.B. 2.   \n177.  The enactment of H.B. 2 follows a history of discrimination by decision-\nmakers against transgender people, including, for example, Governor McCrory’s \nparticipation in a Fourth Circuit amicus curiae brief arguing that a transgender student’s \nrequest to access restrooms in accordance with his gender identity is “radical.”   \nE.  H.B. 2 Harms Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals, as well as \nTransgender Individuals. \n \n178.  H.B. 2 also disproportionately burdens lesbian, gay, and bisexual \nindividuals, as well as transgender individuals, by stripping them of or barring them from \nanti-discrimination projections under local law.  H.B. 2 took aim at the Charlotte \nordinance in a section providing,    \nThe General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in \nemployment is properly an issue of general, statewide concern, such that this \nArticle and other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and \npreempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a \nunit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or \n42 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 42 of 57\n\n \nimposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of \ndiscriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to \npersonnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law. \n \n179.  H.B. 2 stripped lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals of anti-discrimination \nprotections in Charlotte, because no such sexual orientation anti-discrimination \nprotections exist in state law.  The preemptive effect of this section did not fall equally on \nall North Carolinians, however.    \n180.  Recognizing that North Carolina law had no statewide public \naccommodations protection of any kind except for people with disabilities, H.B. 2 \nactually enacted a new public accommodations statute—so that the other groups whose \nprotections also would have been preempted under the Charlotte Ordinance were spared \nthat result.  The new public accommodations statute prohibits discrimination based on \n“race, religion, color, national origin, or biological sex”—omitting the sexual orientation \nprotections that had been included in the Charlotte Ordinance. \n181.  The North Carolina legislature has a history of targeted discrimination \ntoward lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.  For example, the legislature approved and \nreferred to voters a constitutional amendment barring access to marriage for same-sex \ncouples.  Legislative leaders also intervened in litigation challenging the constitutionality \nof the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage pursuant to a statute authorizing \nthem to act on behalf of the General Assembly.  In 2015, the legislature also passed a bill \nthat allows county magistrates to recuse themselves from performing civil marriages.  \n43 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 43 of 57\n\n \n182.  The preemptive effect of H.B. 2 also harmed transgender people.  While the \nCharlotte Ordinance had prohibited discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and \ngender expression, the new public accommodations statute restricted its protections \nsolely to “biological sex,” which is defined in an effort to deliberately exclude \ntransgender people from protection.    \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \n183.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 182 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n184.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants in their official \ncapacities for purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 2 \nboth facially and as applied to them. \n185.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \nA.  Discrimination Based on Sex and Transgender Status in Single-Sex \nRestrooms and Facilities (H.B. 2, Part I) \n \n186.  Section A of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and \nACLU of NC against Defendants Governor McCrory, Board of Governors, and Bissette. \n44 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 44 of 57\n\n \n187.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n188.  H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex. \n189.  Discrimination based on sex includes, but is not limited to, discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition.   \n190.  H.B. 2 facially classifies people based on sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status. \n191.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on transgender status is presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto heightened scrutiny. \n192.  H.B. 2 treats transgender people differently than non-transgender people \nwho are similarly situated.   \n193.  Under H.B. 2, non-transgender people are able to access restrooms and \nother single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity, but transgender people are \nbanned from restrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n194.  H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people based on gender \nnonconformity.  For example, although Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry are men, are \nperceived as men in public, and have had medical treatment to bring their body into \n45 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 45 of 57\n\n \nalignment with their male gender identity, they have birth certificates with female gender \nmarkers that do not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for men.  Furthermore, if \ntransgender men such as Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry had been assigned male at birth, \nthey would not be banned by H.B. 2 from the restrooms and other single-sex facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity.  The same is true for H.S., who is a young woman, \nis perceived as a woman in public, and has had medical treatment to bring her body into \nalignment with her gender but has a birth certificate that classifies her as male and \ntherefore does not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for women.  Had H.S. been assigned \nfemale at birth, she would not be banned by H.B. 2 from restrooms and other single-sex \nfacilities designated for women and girls.  \n195.  No person has any control over the sex that person is assigned at birth.  In \nfact, when a person is born with characteristics associated with both male and female \ninfants, the appropriate course is to assign sex based on likely gender identity and to later \nre-assign sex based on gender identity once it is known if it conflicts with the original sex \nassignment.   \n196.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex or \ntransgender status is not substantially related to any important government interest.  \nIndeed, it is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n197.  H.B. 2 endangers the safety, privacy, security, and well-being of \ntransgender individuals.  For example, if a transgender young woman, like H.S., were to \nuse the restroom designated for men and boys, she likely would be harassed and might be \n46 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 46 of 57\n\n \nassaulted by men or boys who believed that she should not be in that restroom.  Similarly, \nif a transgender man were to use the women’s restroom, he likely would be harassed and \nmight be assaulted by women who believe he should not be in the women’s restroom. \n198.  H.B. 2 does not promote the safety, privacy, security, or well-being of non-\ntransgender people. \n199.  H.B. 2 deprives transgender people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, \nand autonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n200.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex denies \nthem the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nB.   Discrimination Based on Sex, Transgender Status. and Sexual \nOrientation in Preemption of Local Non-Discrimination Protections \n(H.B. 2, Part II, Sections 2.2 & 2.3; H.B. 2, Part III) \n \n201.  Section B of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., \nGilmore, Trent, Newell, and ACLU of NC against Defendant Governor McCrory.   \n202.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex, discrimination based on sexual orientation, and \ndiscrimination based on transgender status are presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto heightened scrutiny. \n203.  H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of protections against discrimination based \non sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. \n47 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 47 of 57\n\n \n204.  H.B. 2 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and \nworse, than other people, including by stripping them of the protections afforded by the \nCity of Charlotte’s Ordinance and precluding any local government from taking action to \nprotect LGBT people against discrimination.   \n205.  H.B. 2 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging LGBT people and is \nbased on animus against LGBT people.  H.B. 2 was also enacted because of, and not in \nspite of, its adverse effects on LGBT people. \n206.  The justifications cited in H.B. 2 for its enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, are pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for the bill.  For example, proposals to add \nsexual orientation and gender identity and expression protections to the statewide public \naccommodations law were rejected. \n207.  By blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people at the local \nlevel, H.B. 2 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT people \nthan on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based \ndiscrimination.  H.B. 2 accordingly places a special burden on LGBT people within the \ngovernmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.   \n208.  H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and \nautonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n48 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 48 of 57\n\n \n209.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against LGBT people based on sex and sexual \norientation denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nC.  Discrimination Based on Transgender Status Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n210.  Transgender people have suffered a long history of extreme discrimination \nin North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such discrimination to \nthis day. \n211.  Transgender people are a discrete and insular group and lack the political \npower to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Transgender people have \nlargely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal protections to protect them \nagainst discrimination.  \n212.  A person’s gender identity or transgender status bears no relation to a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society. \n213.  Gender identity is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n214.  Gender identity generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \n   \n49 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 49 of 57\n\n \nD.  Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n215.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people have suffered a long history of extreme \ndiscrimination in North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such \ndiscrimination to this day. \n216.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are a discrete and insular group and lack \nthe political power to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Lesbian, gay, \nand bisexual people have largely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal \nprotections to protect them against discrimination. \n217.  A person’s sexual orientation bears no relation to a person’s ability to \ncontribute to society. \n218.  Sexual orientation is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n219.  Sexual orientation generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \n \n* * * \n   \n50 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 50 of 57\n\n \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of Right to Privacy \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Governor McCrory, Board of Governors, and Bissette \n \n220.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 182 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n221.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations \non state action that deprives individuals of life, liberty, or property.  \n222.  Substantive protections of the Due Process Clause include the right to avoid \ndisclosure of sensitive, personal information.   \n223.  There is a fundamental right of privacy in preventing the release of, and in \ndeciding in what circumstances to release: (1) personal information of which the release \ncould subject them to bodily harm; and (2) information of a highly personal and intimate \nnature.  \n224.  H.B. 2 requires the disclosure of highly personal information regarding \ntransgender people to each person who sees them using a restroom or other facility \ninconsistent with their gender identity or gender expression.  This disclosure places them \nat risk of bodily harm.   \n225.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n51 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 51 of 57\n\n \n226.  In addition, the privacy interests of transgender people that are invaded \noutweigh any purported interest the government could assert.  \nCOUNT III \n \nViolation of Liberty and Autonomy in the \nRight to Refuse Unwanted Medical Treatment \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Governor McCrory, Board of Governors, and Bissette \n \n227.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 182 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n228.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals’ \nsubstantive rights to be free to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion. \n229.  The right to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion includes the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n230.  H.B. 2 forces transgender people to undergo medical procedures that may \nnot be medically appropriate or available in order to access facilities consistent with their \ngender identity.  \n231.  Not all transgender individuals undergo gender confirmation surgery.  For \nsome, the surgery is not medically necessary, while for others it is medically dangerous \nor impossible.  For example, because medical treatment for gender dysphoria is \nindividualized, hormone treatment may be sufficient to manage the distress associated \n52 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 52 of 57\n\n \nwith gender dysphoria for some individuals.  Surgery may be medically necessary for \nothers who do not have health insurance coverage for it and cannot afford to pay for the \nsurgery out-of-pocket.  \n232.  Some states require proof of surgery before they will allow the gender \nmarker on a birth certificate to be changed.  For those born in North Carolina, state law \nrequires proof of “sex reassignment surgery.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 130A-11B.  \n233.  For example, H.S. has not been able to amend her New Jersey birth \ncertificate to accurately reflect her gender because surgery is not medically necessary for \nher and is generally not available to individuals under 18.  Accordingly, H.B. 2 bans her \nfrom accessing restrooms and other facilities consistent with her gender identity. \n234.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \nCOUNT IV \n \nViolation of Title IX \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, and H.S. \nagainst Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n235.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 182 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n236.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n53 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 9   Filed 04/21/16   Page 53 of 57\n\n \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \n237.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination \non the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition. \n238.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \n239.

This lawsuit challenges North Carolina’s House Bill 142 (Session Law \n2017-4, “H.B. 142”), a law that discriminates against transgender individuals with respect \nto one of life’s most basic and essential bodily functions—using the restroom—and, until \nDecember 2020, blocks local governments from protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender (“LGBT”) people against discrimination in employment and public \naccommodations.  \n2.  H.B. 142 is the culmination of a series of actions by North Carolina \nlawmakers targeting LGBT individuals, and particularly transgender individuals, for \ndiscrimination. By targeting all LGBT people for disfavored treatment and singling out \ntransgender individuals for additional discrimination, H.B. 142 violates fundamental \nguarantees of equal protection and due process in the U.S. Constitution and statutory \nprohibitions on discrimination based on sex under Title IX and Title VII. \n3.  LGBT individuals throughout North Carolina are exposed to invidious \ndiscrimination in their day-to-day lives simply for being themselves, and are denied \nprotection against discrimination under state law. In February 2016, the City of Charlotte \nenacted an ordinance (the “Charlotte Ordinance” or the “Ordinance”) that sought to \naddress the pervasive discrimination faced by LGBT people—and particularly \ntransgender people—by extending the coverage of Charlotte’s existing anti-\ndiscrimination ordinance to bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.  \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 2 of 104\n\n4.  Before the Charlotte Ordinance could take effect, the North Carolina \nGeneral Assembly rushed to convene a special session rife with procedural irregularities \nwith the express purpose of passing a statewide law preventing the Charlotte Ordinance \nfrom taking effect. In a matter of hours, the legislature introduced and passed House Bill \n2 (Session Law 2016-3, Second Special Session, “H.B. 2”) on March 23, 2016, and then-\nGovernor Patrick L. McCrory (“Gov. McCrory”) signed the bill into law that same \nevening. Lawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality.  \nInstead, they openly vilified transgender people, falsely portraying them as predatory and \ndangerous to others.  \n5.  H.B. 2 caused immense harm to the entire LGBT community, but \nparticularly to transgender individuals throughout the state of North Carolina who were \nsingled out for discrimination and barred from restrooms in public buildings and other \nsingle-sex, multiple-user facilities that accorded with their gender identity, absent an \nupdated birth certificate matching their gender identity.  \n6.  In the months following the passage of H.B. 2, North Carolina lost \nhundreds of millions of dollars in revenue as entertainment, sports, and other business \nleaders and organizations withdrew activities and investments from North Carolina \nbecause of H.B. 2’s discriminatory targeting of LGBT individuals.  \n7.  In November 2016, Governor Roy A. Cooper III (“Gov. Cooper” or \n“Defendant Cooper”) was elected, defeating Gov. McCrory.  \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 3 of 104\n\n8.  Even before his inauguration, in an effort to bring business, sports, and \nentertainment activities and investments back to North Carolina, Gov. Cooper attempted \nto work with the North Carolina General Assembly to secure a repeal of H.B. 2. As a first \nstep to securing the repeal of H.B. 2, the Charlotte City Council repealed the Charlotte \nOrdinance in December 2016. Shortly thereafter, the General Assembly convened a \nspecial session on December 21, 2016, solely for the purpose of repealing H.B. 2. \nAlthough numerous repeal bills were proposed—including a bill that would have cleanly \nrepealed H.B. 2 and thus returned North Carolina to the pre-H.B. 2 landscape—none \npassed either chamber because legislators were unwilling to pass a bill that did not \nperpetuate anti-LGBT discrimination. The special session was adjourned with H.B. 2 still \nin effect. \n9.  The General Assembly convened for the 2017 session on January 11, 2017. \nMultiple bills were introduced to repeal H.B. 2. No clean repeal advanced through either \nchamber of the legislature.  \n10.  On March 30, 2017, with the state facing the impending loss of still further \nsporting events, the General Assembly in one day introduced, heard, and passed—and \nGov. Cooper signed—H.B. 142.  \n11.  H.B. 142 passed through the General Assembly precisely because it \neffectively continued, rather than ended, H.B. 2’s discrimination against LGBT \nindividuals. Like H.B. 2, H.B. 142’s targeting of the entire LGBT population for \n4 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 4 of 104\n\ndisfavored treatment and further singling out of transgender individuals is not incidental, \nbut rather is an intentional feature of H.B. 142 that ensured its passage.  \n12.  H.B. 142 bars “[s]tate agencies, boards, offices, departments, institutions, \nbranches of government, including The University of North Carolina and the North \nCarolina Community College System, and political subdivisions of the State, including \nlocal boards of education,” from regulating “access to multiple occupancy restrooms, \nshowers, or changing facilities, except in accordance with an act of the General \nAssembly” (even though no current act of the General Assembly explicitly regulates such \naccess).  \n13.  Read literally, H.B. 142 would appear to prohibit even maintaining separate \nmen’s and women’s rooms or the posting of any sign restricting the use of a multiple \noccupancy restroom, shower, or changing facility to “men” or “women.” However, on \ninformation and belief, neither the state government nor any operator of a state \ngovernment building in North Carolina is currently enforcing H.B. 142 to that effect. \n14.  On the day that he voted for H.B. 142, North Carolina State Representative \nKevin Corbin stated that H.B. 142 “is not a repeal of HB2. . . . The bill clearly states that \ncity councils like Charlotte and other government entities CANNOT regulate access of \nmultiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities. Only the NC General \nAssembly may enact bathroom ordinances. . . . What this essentially means is that the \nrestroom provision of HB2 remains. . . .” \n5 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 5 of 104\n\n15.  While Gov. Cooper has stated that, as a result of the passage of H.B. 142, \nthere currently is no North Carolina state law “barring the use of multiple occupancy \nbathroom facilities in accordance with gender identity,” other North Carolina officials, \nincluding North Carolina State Senator Danny Britt, Speaker of the North Carolina \nAssembly Tim Moore (“Speaker Moore”), and North Carolina Representative Chuck \nMcGrady, have stated that passage of H.B. 142 ensured that transgender individuals can \nbe criminally prosecuted for using restrooms in public buildings that match their gender \nidentity. The resulting uncertainty about whether they could be arrested or suffer other \nadverse consequences means that transgender individuals cannot safely use single-sex, \nmultiple-user restrooms in government-controlled buildings in North Carolina. \n16.  Because of the lack of clarity in H.B. 142, and statements by these and \nother elected officials, transgender individuals have been deterred from using restrooms \nand other single-sex, multiple-user facilities that match their gender identity. In addition, \ntransgender individuals also fear using the restroom that does not match their gender \nidentity; if a transgender man were to use the women’s restroom, for example, he would \nalso fear arrest in those circumstances, because he is likely to be generally perceived by \nothers to be a non-transgender man. \n17.  By deterring transgender individuals from using restrooms and other single-\nsex, multiple-user facilities that accord with their gender identity and preventing local \ngovernments from extending protections in employment and public accommodations \n6 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 6 of 104\n\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity, H.B. 142 violates the United States \nConstitution and federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex.  \n18.  In addition to challenging H.B. 142, Plaintiffs in this lawsuit continue to \nchallenge H.B. 2 in the event that this Court finds that (1) one or more provisions of \nH.B. 142 violate the U.S. Constitution or federal law and (2) H.B. 142’s repeal of H.B. 2 \nis not severable from such provisions of H.B. 142. Plaintiffs who previously raised Title \nVII and/or Title IX claims regarding H.B. 2 also continue to seek nominal damages for \nthe harms caused by H.B. 2’s violation of those statutes.  \nPARTIES \nA.

This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution, under Title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”), and under \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., (“Title VII”). \n36.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under \nlaws of the United States, including laws providing for the protection of civil rights, and \nbecause this suit seeks redress for the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights \nsecured by the United States Constitution. \n37.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) because \nDefendant University of North Carolina resides within the District, and all Defendants \nreside within the State of North Carolina; and because a substantial part of the events that \ngave rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims took place within the District. \n38.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n13 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 13 of 104\n\n39.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are \ndomiciled in North Carolina. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nA.  Plaintiffs. \n \n40.  Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño works for the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill (“UNC-Chapel Hill”) Institute for Global Health and Infectious Disease as a \nProject Coordinator. The project that he coordinates provides medical education and \nservices such as HIV testing to the Latino/a population.  \n41.  Mr. Carcaño is a resident of the city of Durham, North Carolina, and works \nprimarily in the city of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He has also previously resided in the \ntown of Carrboro, North Carolina. Durham is in Durham County, North Carolina, and \nboth Carrboro and Chapel Hill are in Orange County, North Carolina. \n42.  Mr. Carcaño is a man.  \n43.  Mr. Carcaño is transgender. This means that his sex assigned at birth was \nfemale, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately reflect his \ngender identity, which is male.  \n44.  A person’s gender identity refers to the person’s fundamental, internal \nsense of belonging to a particular gender. There is a medical consensus that gender \nidentity is innate and that efforts to change a person’s gender identity are unethical and \nharmful to a person’s health and well-being. \n14 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 14 of 104\n\n45.  The gender marker on a birth certificate is designated at the time of birth \nusually based upon the appearance of an infant’s external genitalia. However, a person’s \nsex has many components, such as chromosomes, hormone levels, internal and external \nreproductive organs, and gender identity.  \n46.  When the components of sex do not align as all typically male or all \ntypically female, a person’s gender identity is what determines the gender a person lives \nas and should be recognized as in all aspects of life.  \n47.  Mr. Carcaño was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical diagnosis \nfor individuals who have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at \nbirth and who experience clinically significant distress as a result. \n48.  Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that, if left untreated, can \nlead to debilitating depression, and even suicidal thoughts and acts.  \n49.  Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized in the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth ed. (2013) \n(DSM-V), and by the other leading medical and mental health professional groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association and the American Psychological \nAssociation. \n50.  Medical treatment for gender dysphoria must be individualized for the \nmedical needs of each patient.  \n15 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 15 of 104\n\n51.  Treatment for gender dysphoria includes living one’s life consistent with \none’s gender identity, including when accessing single-sex spaces such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  \n52.  Forcing transgender individuals to use single-sex, multiple-user spaces that \ndo not match their gender identity or forcing them into separate facilities that no one else \nis forced to use is inconsistent with medical protocols and can cause anxiety and distress \nto the transgender person and result in harassment of and violence against them.  \n53.  Mr. Carcaño was born and raised in South Texas. Since a very young age, \naround 7 or 8 years old, Mr. Carcaño was aware that he did not feel like a girl, but he did \nnot know how to express how he felt. \n54.  Mr. Carcaño ultimately acknowledged his male gender identity to himself \nlater in his adult life. \n55.  Since 2013, Mr. Carcaño has been in the continuous care of a licensed \nmental health clinician, who diagnosed Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria. Mr. Carcaño \ninitially sought treatment for depression, which was caused in part by his gender \ndysphoria. \n56.  Mental health and medical professionals worldwide recognize and follow \nthe evidence-based standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria developed by \nthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”). After \ndiagnosing Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria, his therapist developed a course of \ntreatment consistent with those standards. The goal of such treatment is to alleviate \n16 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 16 of 104\n\ndistress by helping a person live congruently with the person’s gender identity. \nConsistent with that treatment and his identity, in January 2015, Mr. Carcaño explained \nto his family and friends that he is a man. \n57.  A critical component of the WPATH Standards of Care is a social transition \nto living full-time consistently with the individual’s gender identity. For Mr. Carcaño, \nthat includes living in accordance with his male identity in all respects, including the use \nof a traditionally male name and male pronouns and the use of men’s restrooms. \n58.  For transgender people, it is critical that social transition include transition \nin the workplace, including with respect to use of restrooms. Excluding a transgender \nman from the restroom that corresponds to his gender identity, or forcing him to use a \nseparate facility from other men, communicates to the entire workplace that he should not \nbe recognized as a man and undermines the social transition process. \n59.  Mr. Carcaño also began using Joaquín as his first name in January 2015. \nHis friends, family, and coworkers now recognize him as a man, and they refer to him \nusing his traditionally male name and male pronouns. \n60.  Also consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño’s \nphysician recommended and prescribed hormone treatment, which Mr. Carcaño has \nreceived since May 2015. For both hormone therapy and surgical treatment, the WPATH \nStandards of Care require persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria, which is a \ncriterion that Mr. Carcaño satisfied. Among other therapeutic benefits, the hormone \ntreatment has deepened Mr. Carcaño’s voice, increased his growth of facial hair, and \n17 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 17 of 104\n\ngiven him a more traditionally masculine appearance. This treatment helped alleviate the \ndistress Mr. Carcaño experienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex \nand his gender identity and helped him to feel more comfortable with who he is.  \n61.  As part of the treatment for his gender dysphoria, Mr. Carcaño also \nobtained a bilateral mastectomy and nipple reconstruction (also known as “top surgery”) \nin January 2016. Consistent with WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño satisfied the \nrequirement of having a referral from a qualified mental health professional in order to \nobtain the surgical treatment. \n62.  As part of his social transition, Mr. Carcaño began using the men’s \nrestroom at work and elsewhere in late 2015, which occurred without incident for the five \nmonths or so before H.B. 2’s enactment. Mr. Carcaño’s therapist had also specifically \nrecommended that he use only men’s restrooms. She was concerned that using women’s \nrestrooms could compromise his mental health, well-being, and safety. By late 2015, Mr. \nCarcaño had grown facial hair facilitated by hormone treatment, and his therapist \nindicated that others would recognize Mr. Carcaño as a man based on his physical \nappearance. \n63.  Mr. Carcaño is now comfortable with the status of his treatment and, with \nthe exception of the distress caused by the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, his distress \nhas been managed through the clinically recommended treatment he has received. He \nplans to continue treatment under the supervision of medical professionals and based on \nhis medical needs.  \n18 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 18 of 104\n\n64.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. Carcaño was recognized and treated like \nall other men at his job at UNC-Chapel Hill.  \n65.  Apart from the building where he works, Mr. Carcaño also used other \nmen’s restrooms on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus without incident for approximately \nfive months prior to H.B. 2’s passage. In addition, when out in public, such as at \nrestaurants and stores, Mr. Carcaño exclusively used men’s restrooms. \n66.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. Carcaño’s knowledge, \ncomplaints related to his use of restrooms designated for men. \n67.  The only restrooms on the floor where Mr. Carcaño works at UNC-Chapel \nHill are designated either for men or for women. H.B. 2 prohibited him and H.B. 142 \ndeters him from using the same restrooms that his coworkers typically use. This \nexclusion is stigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than other men.  \n68.  Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. Carcaño, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  \n69.  Forcing Mr. Carcaño to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being and would force him to disclose to \nothers the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and harassment.  \n70.  The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. Carcaño to \nexperience significant anxiety. He knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others and possibly lead to violence and harassment against him or \n19 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 19 of 104\n\neven arrest given that he is perceived to be a non-transgender man. He fears for his safety \nbecause of the passage of H.B. 142 and of H.B. 2 before it.  \n71.  In the initial period after H.B. 2’s passage, Mr. Carcaño generally used a \nsingle-user restroom not designated either for men or for women in another building on \ncampus, which was approximately a 10-15 minute walk each way from the building in \nwhich he works.  \n72.  Mr. Carcaño was subsequently informed by administrative staff in the \nbuilding in which he works that they had learned of a single-user restroom based on \nbuilding floor plans. It is accessible using a special service elevator, and the restroom is \ntucked away in a cubby down a hallway in a part of the building used for housekeeping. \n73.  Mr. Carcaño was not only humiliated by being singled out and forced to use \na separate restroom from his colleagues and all other men that he works with, but also \nburdened by having to use a separate restroom on a different floor, which increases the \nlikelihood that he will delay or avoid going to the restroom. During the period when H.B. \n2 was preliminarily enjoined, Mr. Carcaño generally used the men’s restrooms at UNC-\nChapel Hill. \n74.  Some North Carolina government officials have publicly stated that the \npassage of H.B. 142 maintains H.B. 2’s bar on transgender individuals’ use of single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities that match their gender identity. North Carolina government \nofficials have also publicly taken the position that use of the “wrong” restroom could \nsubject transgender individuals to criminal prosecution under trespass laws. \n20 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 20 of 104\n\n75.  In light of the numerous statements from North Carolina legislators that, \nunder H.B. 142, transgender people are still barred from using restrooms that match their \ngender, Mr. Carcaño reasonably fears being arrested and/or prosecuted for trespass or for \nsome other crime if he uses the men’s restroom in public buildings. Though using the \nwomen’s restroom is not feasible for him, if he were to use the women’s restroom, he \nwould also fear arrest in those circumstances given that he is generally perceived by \nothers to be a non-transgender man. \n76.  Since H.B. 142’s passage and the Court’s lifting of the preliminary \ninjunction against enforcement of H.B. 2 with respect to Mr. Carcaño, the University of \nNorth Carolina has refused to state whether Mr. Carcaño is permitted to use restrooms or \nother single-sex, multiple-user facilities at UNC that are consistent with his gender \nidentity. The University of North Carolina and its constituent institutions are expressly \nforbidden by H.B. 142 from regulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-\nuser facilities. As a result, Mr. Carcaño is deterred from using UNC facilities that are \nconsistent with his gender identity, and he cannot use the women’s restrooms, which \ncauses him to sometimes limit his use of restrooms at work altogether. Mr. Carcaño also \nvisits public agencies, as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-760, and intends to and will do \nso in the future. Both H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 cause Mr. Carcaño to fear using the restroom \nin public buildings, and he often takes steps to avoid restroom use altogether.  \n77.  As part of his job at UNC-Chapel Hill, Mr. Carcaño has had to visit the \noffices of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services many times in \n21 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 21 of 104\n\nthe past, and he will continue to need to do so in the future. Prior to the passage of \nH.B. 2, he used the men’s restroom while at their office, but he was banned from doing \nso under H.B. 2 and is deterred from doing so under H.B. 142.  \n78.  Mr. Carcaño has also visited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future, where he was banned from using the \nmen’s restroom under H.B. 2 and is deterred from doing so under H.B. 142. \n79.  Mr. Carcaño also regularly uses the North Carolina Rest Area System, \nwhich maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation. For example, he uses the restrooms provided by that \nsystem when he travels approximately once a month to visit his brother in Atlanta, and \nwhen he visits Washington, D.C. periodically. He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he was banned from using the men’s restroom under H.B. 2 \nand is deterred from doing so under H.B. 142. He cannot use the women’s restrooms \nbecause he is a man, and he fears that he will face possible arrest and prosecution if he \nuses a multi-user restroom facility in a public agency.  \n80.  Under H.B. 142, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Division of Motor Vehicles, and the Department of Transportation—like all \nother state agencies and local governments—are forbidden from regulating access to \nrestrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities. All of this deters Mr. Carcaño from \nuse of the appropriate restroom when he visits facilities controlled by these or other state \n22 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 22 of 104\n\nagencies. This legal uncertainty causes Mr. Carcaño anxiety when he is forced to use a \nrestroom at these state agencies. He often avoids all restroom use in government \nbuildings as a result.  \n81.  Mr. Carcaño is aware that the governments of Carrboro (the town in which \nhe previously resided and that he continues to visit), Chapel Hill (the city in which he \nprimarily works), and Orange County (which encompasses both Carrboro and Chapel \nHill) have regularly monitored local and state consideration of, respectively, ordinances \nand statutes that would, inter alia, prohibit discrimination in employment and public \naccommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, including with \nrespect to restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities. Mr. Carcaño is \ninformed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange \nCounty would pass such ordinances if they were legally permitted to do so under \nH.B. 142.  \n82.  Mr. Carcaño regularly frequents places of public accommodation, such as \nrestaurants and stores, in Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange County. He would \naccordingly benefit from the protections of such anti-discrimination ordinances in those \njurisdictions. Under H.B. 142, however, Mr. Carcaño is deprived of the protections of \nsuch ordinances and is prevented from advocating for such protections before local \ngovernment bodies.  \n83.  With the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, Mr. Carcaño is also limited in his \nability to increase non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in Carrboro, Chapel \n23 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 23 of 104\n\nHill, Orange County, and elsewhere in North Carolina. Were these localities able to enact \nsuch protections, Mr. Carcaño would advocate for local ordinances that prohibit \ndiscrimination in employment and public accommodations based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity in these and other North Carolina jurisdictions.  \n84.  Mr. Carcaño, who is an employee of the University of North Carolina \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), has exhausted administrative remedies \nbefore the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) with respect to his \nrights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He filed a charge of discrimination \nwith the EEOC on April 20, 2016 alleging that UNC had violated Title VII’s prohibition \nagainst sex discrimination. He requested his right to sue on October 19, 2016, after at \nleast 180 days had elapsed from the filing of his charge, and he received his right to sue \non November 21, 2016. \n85.  Mr. Carcaño is a member of the ACLU of NC.  \n86.  Plaintiff Payton Grey McGarry is a full-time student at the University of \nNorth Carolina at Greensboro (“UNC-Greensboro”), where he is majoring in Economics \nwith a minor in music. He is also a skilled musician and has played trumpet in many \nensembles at UNC-Greensboro. He plays the guitar, baritone, clarinet, and saxophone. \n87.  Mr. McGarry is close to his family and has a younger brother who is also a \nmember of the LGBT community. Mr. McGarry hopes to use his education to eventually \ngo to law school and work to defend people’s civil rights. \n88.  Mr. McGarry is a man.  \n24 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 24 of 104\n\n89.  Mr. McGarry is transgender. As is true for Mr. Carcaño, Mr. McGarry’s \nsex assigned at birth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does \nnot conform to his gender identity, which is male.  \n90.  Mr. McGarry has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n91.  Mr. McGarry was born and raised in Wilson, North Carolina. Throughout \nhis childhood, Mr. McGarry felt like a boy and never really thought of himself as a girl. It \nwas not until he started to go through puberty that he began to wrestle with the disconnect \nbetween his identity as a boy and his assigned birth sex.  \n92.  Mr. McGarry realized while he was in high school that he is transgender. \n93.  In October 2013, during his senior year in high school, Mr. McGarry began \nmental health treatment with a licensed clinical social worker who diagnosed him with \ngender dysphoria.  \n94.  After diagnosing Mr. McGarry with gender dysphoria, his therapist \ndeveloped a course of treatment in accordance with medical standards for treating the \ncondition.  \n95.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in the fall and winter of \n2013, Mr. McGarry explained to his friends and family that he is male and began to use \nmale pronouns.  \n96.  In April 2014, under the care of an endocrinologist, Mr. McGarry began \nhormone therapy. This treatment helped alleviate the distress that Mr. McGarry \n25 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 25 of 104\n\nexperienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his identity and \nhelped him to feel more comfortable with who he is. \n97.  By the time he graduated high school in June 2014, Mr. McGarry used the \nname Payton and male pronouns in all aspects of his life. He is known as Payton \nMcGarry to his family, friends, and peers, although he has not yet changed his legal first \nname to Payton. \n98.  In the fall of 2014, Mr. McGarry enrolled as a freshman at UNC-\nGreensboro as Payton McGarry and as male. \n99.  Since arriving at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. McGarry has identified and has \nbeen known to others as male for all purposes. \n100.  Mr. McGarry is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity, \nand previously served as the Vice President of the Iota Epsilon Chapter of that fraternity. \nHis fraternity brothers are aware that he is transgender and have no concerns with his use \nof men’s restrooms and locker rooms. \n101.  Although Mr. McGarry currently lives off campus, he is on campus six or \nseven days per week and always used restrooms designated for men in on-campus \nbuildings prior to the passage of H.B. 2. He also used the locker room facilities at UNC-\nGreensboro and always used the facilities designated for men before the passage of H.B. \n2.  \n102.  For the year and a half between when he enrolled at UNC-Greensboro and \nH.B. 2 was passed, Mr. McGarry used the men’s restrooms and locker rooms on-campus \n26 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 26 of 104\n\nwithout incident. Mr. McGarry is unaware of any instance in which any person has \ncomplained about his use of the men’s restrooms or locker room.  \n103.  Mr. McGarry works part-time as a visual technician for marching bands at \ndifferent high schools around the state and regularly uses the restrooms designated as \nbeing for men when working as a visual technician. There have been no incidents or, to \nthe best of Mr. McGarry’s knowledge, complaints related to his use of the restrooms \ndesignated for men. \n104.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, Mr. \nMcGarry always uses men’s restrooms. \n105.  To Mr. McGarry’s knowledge, there are very few single-user restrooms on \nthe UNC-Greensboro campus, and there are no single-user restrooms in many buildings \nwhere he has classes. \n106.  If Mr. McGarry could not use the men’s restrooms at UNC-Greensboro, he \nwould have to search for single-user restrooms outside of the buildings where his classes \nare held every time he had to use the restroom. This would disrupt his ability to attend \nclass and would interfere with his educational opportunities. Expelling him from the \nmultiple-user restrooms and locker rooms available to all other male students is \nstigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than other men. \n107.  Since he started testosterone two years ago, Mr. McGarry’s voice has \ndeepened and his face and body have become more traditionally masculine in \nappearance. \n27 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 27 of 104\n\n108.  Using women’s restrooms is not a viable option for Mr. McGarry, just as it \nwould not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use women’s \nrestrooms. Forcing Mr. McGarry to use women’s restrooms would also cause substantial \nharm to his mental health and well-being. It additionally would force him to disclose to \nothers the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and harassment. \n109.  The idea of being forced into women’s restrooms causes Mr. McGarry to \nexperience significant anxiety, as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others. He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2 and \nH.B. 142.  \n110.  Under H.B. 2, Mr. McGarry was barred from using the men’s restrooms on \ncampus, and Mr. McGarry would again be so barred if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to be \nfound inseverable from the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142. While H.B. 2 was in force, \nand prior to the Court’s entry of a preliminary injunction, given that Mr. McGarry could \nnot use women’s restrooms and there are only a few available single-user restrooms, he \noften avoided going to the restroom all day.  \n111.  Some North Carolina government officials have publicly stated that the \npassage of H.B. 142 maintains H.B. 2’s bar on transgender individuals’ use of single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities that match their gender identity. North Carolina government \nofficials have also publicly taken the position that use of the “wrong” restroom could \nsubject transgender individuals to criminal prosecution under trespass laws.  \n28 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 28 of 104\n\n112.  In light of the numerous statements from North Carolina legislators that, \nunder H.B. 142, transgender people are still barred from using restrooms that match their \ngender, Mr. McGarry reasonably fears being arrested and/or prosecuted for trespass or for \nsome other crime if he uses the men’s room in public buildings. Using the women’s \nrestroom is not an option for Mr. McGarry, but if he were ever to use the women’s \nrestroom in an emergency he would similarly fear arrest given that he is generally \nperceived to be a non-transgender man. \n113.  Since H.B. 142’s passage and the Court’s lifting of the preliminary \ninjunction against enforcement of H.B. 2 with respect to Mr. McGarry, the University of \nNorth Carolina has refused to state whether Mr. McGarry is permitted to use restrooms or \nother single-sex, multiple-user facilities at UNC that are consistent with his gender \nidentity. The University of North Carolina and its constituent institutions are expressly \nforbidden by H.B. 142 from regulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-\nuser facilities. As a result, Mr. McGarry is deterred from using UNC facilities that are \nconsistent with his gender identity, and cannot use the women’s facilities. Consequently, \nhe sometimes limits his use of restrooms at UNC altogether. \n114.  Violating school policy or state law is grounds for expulsion at the \nUniversity of North Carolina. Because Mr. McGarry does not know if using the men’s \nrestroom constitutes an enforceable violation, he is afraid that using the men’s restroom \ncould put his educational future in jeopardy. He also cannot use the women’s restroom. \n29 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 29 of 104\n\nThis means that he is unable to safely use a multi-user facility on campus without fear of \nexpulsion or other civil or criminal consequences. \n115.  Mr. McGarry has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760, and intends to and will do so in the future. Both H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 cause \nMr. McGarry to fear using the restroom in public buildings and he often takes steps to \navoid restroom use altogether in such buildings because of H.B. 142 and, before it, H.B. \n2. \n116.  Mr. McGarry has visited the Division of Motor Vehicles of the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future. He was banned from using men’s \nrestrooms under H.B. 2, and is deterred from doing so under H.B. 142. \n117.  Mr. McGarry also has used and will continue to use the North Carolina \nRest Area System, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by \nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation. He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but was banned from using men’s restrooms under H.B. 2 and is \ndeterred from doing so under H.B. 142. \n118.  Under H.B. 142, the Division of Motor Vehicles, and the Department of \nTransportation—like all other state agencies and local governments—are forbidden from \nregulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities. All of this \ndeters Mr. McGarry from use of the appropriate restroom when he visits facilities \ncontrolled by these or other state agencies. This legal uncertainty causes Mr. McGarry \n30 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 30 of 104\n\nanxiety when he must use a restroom at these state agencies. He often avoids all restroom \nuse in government buildings as a result. \n119.  Mr. McGarry is aware that the City of Greensboro has expressly prohibited \ndiscrimination in housing on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and that \nit could expressly prohibit such discrimination in other contexts as well, including with \nrespect to restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities.  \n120.  Mr. McGarry regularly frequents places of public accommodation, such as \nrestaurants and stores, in Greensboro. He would accordingly benefit from the protections \nof anti-discrimination ordinances. Under H.B. 142, however, Mr. McGarry is deprived of \nthe protections of such ordinances and is prevented from advocating for such protections \nbefore local government bodies. \n121.  With the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, Mr. McGarry is also limited in \nhis ability to increase non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in Greensboro and \nelsewhere in North Carolina. Were these localities able to enact such protections, Mr. \nMcGarry would advocate for local ordinances that prohibit discrimination in employment \nand public accommodations based on sexual orientation and gender identity in \nGreensboro and other North Carolina jurisdictions.  \n122.  Plaintiff Hunter Schafer is a recent graduate of the University of North \nCarolina School of the Arts High School (“UNCSA-HS”). The oldest of four children, \nshe is close to her family, who love and support her. She is an accomplished artist and \nstudied visual arts at UNCSA-HS. \n31 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 31 of 104\n\n123.  Ms. Schafer is a young woman. \n124.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Schafer was recognized as a girl at school \nand when out in public. \n125.  Ms. Schafer is transgender. She was assigned the sex of male at birth, as \nher birth certificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately reflect her gender \nidentity, which is female. \n126.  Ms. Schafer has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n127.  Ms. Schafer was born in New Jersey but moved to North Carolina when she \nwas 11 years old. From as young an age as two or three, Ms. Schafer gravitated towards \nclothing and toys generally associated with girls. Like many other girls, she would \nalways want to wear pink princess dresses at pre-school and to play with Barbie dolls. \n128.  After completing pre-school, Ms. Schafer did not feel comfortable \nexpressing her identity as a girl and tried to immerse herself in traditionally masculine \nspaces and activities. She tried to do things that she felt she was supposed to do as a boy. \nBut nothing felt right. \n129.  Starting in seventh grade, Ms. Schafer again began to gravitate toward \nclothes and activities that were considered more feminine. \n130.  By eighth grade, Ms. Schafer again began to express a more stereotypically \nfeminine gender and at times would wear makeup and high-heeled shoes at school. \n32 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 32 of 104\n\n131.  As puberty began to approach in ninth grade, severe gender dysphoria and \nanxiety began to hit Ms. Schafer, and she experienced significant distress around her \nbody and identity. She finally went to her parents, who recognized that she was suffering. \n132.  In ninth grade, Ms. Schafer began therapy with an expert on treating \ntransgender young people and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n133.  In 2013, Ms. Schafer started high school at Broughton High School in \nRaleigh. In the middle of her freshman year, Ms. Schafer began hormone blockers to \nprevent the onset of male puberty and the development of secondary sex characteristics \nassociated with men. This treatment delayed puberty while Ms. Schafer continued to \nunderstand her female identity. Though Ms. Schafer continued to experience some \ndistress and dysphoria, the hormone blockers greatly reduced her suffering. \n134.  At the end of ninth grade, Ms. Schafer felt fully comfortable embracing her \nidentity as a girl at school and had the full support of her parents. On the last day of \nschool of her freshman year, Ms. Schafer wore a skirt to school that her mother had \npurchased for her. It was an important and symbolic turning point in her comfort with and \nembrace of her identity as a girl. \n135.  By sophomore year, Ms. Schafer was perceived as a girl and began to use \nthe girls’ bathrooms at school and in public. She was also known by this time by female \npronouns such as she, her, and hers. \n33 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 33 of 104\n\n136.  During her sophomore year, Ms. Schafer was elected to the Queen’s Court \nat her school, an honor that had, in the seventy-five years of the tradition, been bestowed \nonly on non-transgender girls.  \n137.  Under the care of her endocrinologist, during her sophomore year in high \nschool, Ms. Schafer continued to assess her medical treatment for gender dysphoria and \nbegan to consider hormone replacement therapy. At the end of her sophomore year, in the \nspring of 2015, Ms. Schafer began estrogen therapy to continue her medical transition. \nMs. Schafer never underwent puberty as a boy. \n138.  An accomplished visual artist, Ms. Schafer applied to the UNCSA-HS for \nher junior year and was accepted. \n139.  In the fall of 2015, Ms. Schafer moved to Winston-Salem to attend \nUNCSA-HS as a boarding student. She studied visual arts there and aspires to a career in \nfashion. \n140.  Ms. Schafer lived in the girls’ dormitory at UNCSA-HS. \n141.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Schafer exclusively used the girls’ or \nwomen’s restrooms at school and could not imagine ever using a restroom designated for \nboys or men. Ms. Schafer is unaware of any instance in which any person complained \nabout her use of the women’s restrooms.  \n142.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, \nMs. Schafer uses the restrooms designated for women and girls. \n34 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 34 of 104\n\n143.  Outside of Ms. Schafer’s dorm room, there were no single-user restrooms \navailable to her at UNCSA-HS in the spring semester of 2016, and it was disruptive to \nher education to have to avoid the use of the restroom or to return to her room or locate a \nsingle-user restroom off campus every time she needed to go to the restroom. Ms. Schafer \nwas also unaware of any single-user restrooms that were readily available to her in all the \nbuildings where she had class in the fall semester of 2016 or spring semester of 2017. \n144.  Forcing Ms. Schafer out of spaces shared with her female peers is \nstigmatizing and marked her as different and lesser than other girls and young women at \nschool. \n145.  Particularly because she never went through puberty as a boy and began \nestrogen treatment beginning in 2015, Ms. Schafer has a traditionally feminine \nappearance. She is recognized as female in all aspects of her life. \n146.  Using boys’ or men’s restrooms is not a viable option for Ms. Schafer, just \nas it would not be a viable option for non-transgender women and girls to be forced to \nuse restrooms designated for men and boys. Forcing Ms. Schafer to use restrooms \ndesignated for men and boys would also cause substantial harm to her mental health and \nwell-being and would put her in danger of harassment and violence. It would also force \nher to disclose to others the fact that she is transgender, which itself could lead to \nviolence and harassment. Given that she is perceived to be a non-transgender woman in \nall aspects of her life, use of a boys’ or men’s restroom could also lead to someone \ncalling the police and her arrest. \n35 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 35 of 104\n\n147.  The idea of being forced into restrooms designated for boys and men at \nschool and in public has caused Ms. Schafer to experience significant anxiety and brings \nup painful memories and anxiety from her earlier childhood. She has feared for her safety \nbecause of the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142.  \n148.  Some North Carolina government officials have publicly stated that the \npassage of H.B. 142 maintains H.B. 2’s bar on transgender individuals’ use of single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities that match their gender identity. North Carolina government \nofficials have also publicly taken the position that the use of the “wrong” restroom could \nsubject transgender individuals to criminal prosecution under trespass laws.  \n149.  In light of the numerous statements from North Carolina legislators that, \nunder H.B. 142, transgender people are still barred from using restrooms that match their \ngender identity, Ms. Schafer reasonably fears being arrested and/or prosecuted for \ntrespass or for some other crime if she uses the women’s room in public buildings. \nThough using a men’s restroom is not an option for her, she would similarly fear arrest if \nshe used a men’s restroom given that she is generally perceived to be a non-transgender \nwoman.  \n150.  After H.B. 2 was passed, Ms. Schafer limited or delayed use of restrooms \nin public buildings because of fear of reprisals if she used restrooms designated for \nwomen and girls and because she feared for her safety if she used restrooms designated \nfor men and boys, as the law required.  \n36 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 36 of 104\n\n151.  Ms. Schafer has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760, and intends to and will do so in the future. Both H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 cause \nMs. Shafer to fear using the restroom in public buildings and she has often taken steps to \navoid restroom use altogether in such buildings because of H.B. 142 and, before it, H.B. \n2. \n152.  Ms. Schafer has visited the Division of Motor Vehicles of the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future. She was banned from using the \nwomen’s restroom under H.B. 2 and is deterred from doing so under H.B. 142. \n153.  Ms. Schafer has used and will continue to use the North Carolina Rest Area \nSystem, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation. She will need to continue to use those restrooms \nin the future, but she was banned from using women’s restrooms under H.B. 2 and is \ndeterred from doing so under H.B. 142. \n154.  Under H.B. 142, the Division of Motor Vehicles, and the Department of \nTransportation—like all other state agencies and local governments—are forbidden from \nregulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities. All of this \ndeters Ms. Schafer from use of the appropriate restroom when she visits facilities \ncontrolled by these or other state agencies and she cannot use the men’s facilities. This \nlegal uncertainty causes Ms. Schafer anxiety about using a restroom at these state \nagencies and as a result she often avoids restroom use altogether.  \n37 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 37 of 104\n\n155.  Ms. Schafer has regularly frequented places of public accommodation, such \nas restaurants and stores, in Raleigh, where her family resides. She would accordingly \nbenefit from the protections of anti-discrimination ordinances. Under H.B. 142, however, \nMs. Schafer is deprived of the protections of such ordinances and is prevented from \nadvocating for such protections before local government bodies.  \n156.  With the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, Ms. Schafer is also limited in her \nability to increase non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in Raleigh and \nelsewhere in North Carolina. Were these localities able to enact such protections, Ms. \nSchafer would advocate for local ordinances that prohibit discrimination in employment \nand public accommodations based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Raleigh \nand other North Carolina jurisdictions. \n157.  Plaintiff Madeline Goss is a resident of Raleigh, North Carolina. Ms. Goss \nwas born in Hickory, North Carolina, and has lived most of her life in the state. She is a \ndevoted parent to her 11-year-old daughter, and enjoys teaching TaeKwonDo.  \n158.  Ms. Goss is a woman.  \n159.  Ms. Goss is transgender. Ms. Goss’s sex assigned at birth was male, but she \nrecalls knowing that she was female since her earliest memories as a child.  \n160.  Ms. Goss had made efforts to transition earlier in life, but it took until 2006 \nfor her to develop the support network she needed to begin living consistent with her life-\nlong gender identity as a woman.    \n38 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 38 of 104\n\n161.  Ms. Goss was diagnosed with gender dysphoria (then known as gender \nidentity disorder) in 2006. By 2007, Ms. Goss had begun hormone therapy and was living \nas a woman full-time. Ms. Goss had sex reassignment surgery in 2011.  \n162.  Ms. Goss has updated her identity documents to reflect her female name \nand gender, including her driver’s license, social security card, birth certificate, and \npassport.  \n163.  Ms. Goss lives as a woman in all aspects of her life. Ms. Goss uses \nwomen’s restrooms in privately owned buildings, such as at restaurants and stores, and at \nher job.  \n164.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Ms. Goss’s knowledge, \ncomplaints related to her use of restrooms designated for women in these non-\ngovernment buildings.  \n165.  Ms. Goss accesses public buildings governed by H.B. 142 on a regular \nbasis. For example, Ms. Goss travels to visit family in western North Carolina \napproximately two to three times a year, and she uses public restrooms along the \nhighways that are operated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Ms. \nGoss also has lobbied the legislature and visited the General Assembly building \napproximately six or seven times in the last year on behalf of the ACLU and Equality \nNorth Carolina, and she intends to continue doing so in the coming year. Some visits to \nthe General Assembly last the better part of the day, making it impossible to participate \n39 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 39 of 104\n\nwithout using a restroom. Ms. Goss is not aware of any single-user restrooms in any of \nthose public buildings. \n166.  Although Ms. Goss was not prohibited by H.B. 2 from using women’s \nrestrooms in public buildings, because her birth certificate lists her gender as female, the \nlaw felt like an invitation for others to discriminate against transgender people, and that \nmade her feel more worried about her safety.  \n167.  H.B. 142 has made her situation feel even more unsafe, however, since the \nlaw creates significant uncertainty about her right to access women’s restrooms in public \nbuildings. Ms. Goss fears that H.B. 142’s targeted discrimination against transgender \npeople invites others to single her out for discrimination, harassment, or worse yet, \npossible violence. The law leaves her with the frightening feeling that anything could \nhappen when she uses a restroom in a public building, and she worries that she might \nneed to defend herself from an attack.  \n168.  In light of the numerous statements from North Carolina legislators that, \nunder H.B. 142, transgender people are barred from using restrooms that match their \ngender, Ms. Goss reasonably fears being arrested and/or prosecuted for trespass or for \nsome other crime if she uses the women’s room in public buildings. Though using a \nmen’s restroom is not an option for her, she would similarly fear arrest if she used a \nmen’s restroom given that she is generally perceived to be a non-transgender woman.  \n169.  Ms. Goss also knows how important local non-discrimination ordinances \nare to address discrimination against transgender people in private employment and \n40 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 40 of 104\n\npublic accommodations, including with respect to the use of single-sex, multiple-user \nfacilities. For example, when Ms. Goss transitioned, she was required for several months \nto go up three flights of stairs to use the female restroom of a different company – an \nindignity that she would have been spared had non-discrimination protections existed. \n170.  Ms. Goss is aware that the governments of Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and \nOrange County, where she visits shops and restaurants, have regularly monitored local \nand state consideration of, respectively, ordinances and statutes that would, inter alia, \nprohibit discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity. Ms. Goss is informed and believes, and on that basis \nalleges, that Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange County would pass such ordinances if \nthey were legally permitted to under H.B. 142. Under H.B. 142, however, Ms. Goss is \ndeprived of the protections of such ordinances, and is limited in her ability to increase \nand benefit from non-discrimination protections. Were she able to, Ms. Goss would \nadvocate for local ordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and \ngender identity.  \n171.  Ms. Goss is a member of the ACLU of NC.  \n172.  Plaintiff Angela Gilmore is a resident of Durham, North Carolina. \nMs. Gilmore has lived in North Carolina since 2011, when she moved from Florida to \ntake a job at North Carolina Central University. She is currently the Associate Dean for \nAcademic Affairs and Professor of Law at North Carolina Central University.  \n41 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 41 of 104\n\n173.  Ms. Gilmore is a lesbian, and has been in a relationship with her wife, \nAngela Wallace, for almost twenty years. Ms. Gilmore and Ms. Wallace were married in \nWashington, D.C. in 2014.  \n174.  Ms. Gilmore looked for and accepted a job in North Carolina, after she and \nher wife fell in love with the state during a visiting teaching job Ms. Gilmore had at Elon \nUniversity School of Law in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2010.  \n175.  Both Ms. Gilmore and her wife, African American lesbians, felt that North \nCarolina, and Durham in particular, was a place where they could be fully themselves, \ncomfortable in terms of both their race and sexual orientation.  \n176.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife love living in Durham, and they feel very much \npart of the community. Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, they had been looking at small \ntowns in North Carolina where they might want to retire. \n177.  Since moving to North Carolina, Ms. Gilmore has worked towards \nincreasing non-discrimination protections for LGBT people. Ms. Gilmore is a member of \nthe ACLU of NC, and she was on the ACLU of NC board between 2014 and 2015. \nDuring that time, the ACLU of NC actively worked to defeat anti-LGBT bills proposed \nin the state legislature and to pass local ordinances, like the Charlotte Ordinance, to \nprotect LGBT people from discrimination at the local level. Ms. Gilmore also has spoken \non panels at her law school and other law schools regarding non-discrimination \nprotections for LGBT people. \n42 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 42 of 104\n\n178.  The passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 have caused Ms. Gilmore and her wife \ndistress, in that it has significantly undone their sense of belonging and value in the state, \nwhich is why they moved to North Carolina. Ms. Gilmore and her wife experience H.B. 2 \nand H.B. 142 as sending a clear message to them as lesbians that they are not welcome in \nNorth Carolina. \n179.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife have visited the City of Charlotte and they plan \nto do so in the future. As two women traveling together with the same first name, they are \noften asked about the nature of their relationship, and they therefore regularly reveal \nthemselves to be a lesbian couple. Under the Charlotte Ordinance, Ms. Gilmore and her \nwife would have been protected from sexual orientation discrimination in public \naccommodations in the city. With the passage of H.B. 2, the repeal of the Charlotte \nOrdinance as part of an effort to obtain a “clean repeal” of H.B. 2, and then the passage \nof H.B. 142, which bars reenactment of an ordinance similar to the Charlotte Ordinance \nuntil at least December of 2020, Ms. Gilmore worries that she and her wife will now be \nexposed to discrimination based on their sexual orientation.  \n180.  With the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, Ms. Gilmore also is limited in her \nability to increase and benefit from non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in \nNorth Carolina. Were she able to, Ms. Gilmore would continue to advocate for local \nordinances that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n43 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 43 of 104\n\n181.  As a non-transgender woman who always uses the facilities designated for \nwomen in both public and private spaces, Ms. Gilmore does not feel safer in these \nfacilities because of the passage of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142. \n182.  Plaintiff Quinton Harper is a resident of Carrboro, North Carolina.  \n183.  Mr. Harper is a bisexual man.  \n184.  Mr. Harper was born in Snow Hill, North Carolina, and moved to the \nResearch Triangle area in 2003 to pursue his undergraduate education. Mr. Harper \nstudied journalism and political science at UNC-Chapel Hill, where he received the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Award for his service and leadership in the National Black AIDS \nMobilization Movement. After leaving for a few years to work as an HIV/AIDS activist, \nMr. Harper returned in 2009 to the state he will always consider home, and became a \nCarrboro resident.  \n185.  As a young African-American man, Mr. Harper has long been moved by \nthe HIV epidemic that he saw disproportionately ravaging his community. He first \nworked for the Black AIDS Institute in Los Angeles, California, and became a leader in \nthe National Black AIDS Mobilization Movement. He became a community organizer for \nthe North Carolina AIDS Action Network upon moving back to North Carolina, before \naccepting his current position as Field Director with Democracy North Carolina.  \n186.  Active participation in the political system is a long-held ethic for Mr. \nHarper, who volunteered for his first political campaign when he was in high school. He \nalso is engaged in the administration of local government, serving on two municipal \n44 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 44 of 104\n\nboards. He is a member of the Carrboro Human Services Commission, which advises the \nBoard of Alderman on funding requests from non-profit agencies, and previously served \nas a board member for the Orange County Water and Sewer Authority. In addition, he \npreviously served as the campaign manager for a Carrboro Board of Aldermen candidate; \nhe is playing this role again in the current election cycle for another Carrboro Board \ncandidate. \n187.  Mr. Harper came out as bisexual while in high school in Snow Hill, where \nhe was surrounded by supportive, diverse fellow students. He has experienced first-hand \nhow important it is to be able to live as one’s authentic self, without fear of reprisal or \ndiscrimination, so that one can thrive and contribute fully to the community. \n188.  Mr. Harper knows through his work for the LGBT community that bias \nagainst lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals and against transgender individuals is \nentrenched. For example, he routinely encountered lesbian, gay, and bisexual people \nthrough his work with the North Carolina AIDS Action Network who had experienced \ndiscrimination based on their sexual orientation, and significant numbers of transgender \npeople who were chronically unemployed because of pervasive anti-transgender bias \namong prospective employers. Mr. Harper himself worries that he will be exposed to \ndiscrimination in public accommodations based on his sexual orientation.  \n189.  Mr. Harper views local non-discrimination ordinances as a critical tool to \nhelp address the widespread discrimination affecting the LGBT community, and an \nimportant part of signaling to LGBT people that their local government values and \n45 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 45 of 104\n\nsupports them. This is especially the case in the wake of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, which Mr. \nHarper experiences as communicating that LGBT people are not welcome in North \nCarolina. In particular, Mr. Harper experienced the adoption of H.B. 142 as North \nCarolina leaders placing political interests above the inherent dignity of their fellow \nNorth Carolinians. Carrboro’s motto is “feel free,” but Mr. Harper feels like that motto \nwill ring hollow as long as LGBT residents lack the local protection to be free from \ndiscrimination.  \n190.  Mr. Harper is aware that the governments of Carrboro (the town in which \nhe resides), Chapel Hill (a city he visits frequently), and Orange County (which \nencompasses both Carrboro and Chapel Hill) have regularly monitored local and state \nconsideration of, respectively, ordinances and statutes that would, inter alia, prohibit \ndiscrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity. Mr. Harper is informed and believes, and on that basis \nalleges, that Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange County would pass such ordinances if \nthey were legally permitted to under H.B. 142.  \n191.  Mr. Harper regularly frequents places of public accommodation, such as \nrestaurants and stores, in Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange County. He would \naccordingly benefit from the protections of such anti-discrimination ordinances in those \njurisdictions. Under H.B. 142, however, Mr. Harper is deprived of the protections of such \nordinances.  \n46 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 46 of 104\n\n192.  Mr. Harper also is limited in his ability to increase and benefit from non-\ndiscrimination protections. Mr. Harper has long worked to protect LGBT people from \ndiscrimination, for example serving as a field organizer in the campaign that sought to \ndefeat an amendment to the North Carolina Constitution banning marriage for same-sex \ncouples. Were he able to, Mr. Harper would advocate for local ordinances that prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n193.  As a non-transgender man who always uses the facilities designated for \nmen in both public and private spaces, Mr. Harper does not feel safer in these facilities \nbecause of the passage of H.B. 2 or H.B. 142. \n194.  Mr. Harper is a member of the ACLU of NC.  \nB.  The City of Charlotte’s Enactment of a Non-Discrimination \nOrdinance. \n \n195.  Advocates have long worked for the passage of an ordinance that would \nensure that LGBT people were expressly protected from discrimination within the City of \nCharlotte.  \n196.  There was again extensive discussion and deliberation leading up to the \nFebruary 2016 vote on the Charlotte Ordinance. The Charlotte City Council heard hours \nof robust public comment in a forum that included hundreds of people—both those who \nsupported and opposed the Charlotte Ordinance. The Charlotte City Council also received \nsignificant legal analysis from the Office of the City Attorney regarding its authority to \nenact the Ordinance and the effect of the Ordinance.  \n47 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 47 of 104\n\n197.  The impetus for the Charlotte Ordinance was the reality that LGBT people \noften face pervasive discrimination. Although same-sex couples may now marry \nthroughout the United States as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Obergefell \nv. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), lesbian, gay, and bisexual people remain vulnerable to \ndiscrimination in states like North Carolina where there is no express protection against \nsexual orientation discrimination in state law, making local anti-discrimination \nprotections even more vital. Discrimination is especially pervasive for transgender people \nwho face disproportionately high levels of harassment, discrimination, and violence in all \naspects of life. \n198.  A national report of transgender individuals across the country – the Report \nof the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, issued in December 2016 – found that 30% of \nrespondents who had a job in the prior year reported being fired, denied a promotion, or \nexperiencing some other form of mistreatment related to their gender identity or \nexpression, and more than three-quarters (77%) of respondents who had a job in the prior \nyear took steps to avoid mistreatment in the workplace, such as hiding or delaying their \ngender transition or quitting their job. Nearly half (46%) of respondents were verbally \nharassed in the prior year because of being transgender, while nearly one in ten (9%) \nrespondents were physically attacked in the prior year because of their being transgender. \nFurthermore, nearly half (47%) of respondents were sexually assaulted at some point in \ntheir lifetime and one in ten (10%) were sexually assaulted in the prior year. Of the \nrespondents who visited a place of public accommodation where staff or employees \n48 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 48 of 104\n\nthought or knew they were transgender, nearly one-third (31%) experienced at least one \ntype of mistreatment in the prior year in a place of public accommodation, including 14% \nwho were denied equal treatment or service, 24% who were verbally harassed, and 2% \nwho were physically attacked because of their being transgender.  \n199.  In 2013, it was estimated that there were more than 250,000 LGBT adults \nin North Carolina, of whom an estimated 15,600 were transgender individuals age 13 to \n19 years old. A 2016 report estimated that there are approximately 44,750 transgender \nadults living in North Carolina. While transgender individuals make up only a small \nminority of the population, they are disproportionately targeted for hate crimes in the \nUnited States. \n200.  On Monday, February 22, 2016, by a 7-to-4 vote, the Charlotte City \nCouncil approved the Charlotte Ordinance, which, inter alia, amended its existing public \naccommodations protections by adding a ban on discrimination in public \naccommodations based on “gender identity, gender expression” and “sexual orientation.” \n201.  The City Council’s vote was met with a firestorm of opposition from vocal \nopponents to the part of the Charlotte Ordinance that would have required certain public \naccommodations to allow transgender people to use single-sex, multiple-user facilities, \nsuch as restrooms and locker rooms that accord with their gender identity. \n202.  Opponents of the Charlotte Ordinance distorted the truth of what the \nOrdinance’s non-discrimination requirement would accomplish and formed a vocal \ncampaign decrying a purported attempt to permit “men in women’s restrooms.” \n49 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 49 of 104\n\nC.  The Events Leading to H.B. 2, Contemporary Statements by Decision \nMakers, and Departures From the Normal Legislative Process \nRevealed a Series of Official Actions Taken for Invidious Purposes.  \n \n203.  The State of North Carolina (the “State”) has rarely, if ever, exercised \nauthority to preempt local ordinances providing broader protections than under State law. \nFor example, in 1968 Charlotte adopted an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in public \naccommodations on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin. In 1972, the \nCouncil amended that ordinance to prohibit discrimination based on sex, which the \nCouncil further modified in 1985. \n204.  Even though all of these protections extended beyond the reach of the \nState’s public accommodations law, which until H.B. 2 prohibited only public \naccommodations discrimination based on disability, the State allowed Charlotte’s \nordinance to stand undisturbed for decades. It was only after Charlotte took steps to \nprotect LGBT people that the State rushed to preempt the ordinance. \n205.  Even before the Charlotte City Council had cast its vote on the Charlotte \nOrdinance, Gov. McCrory informed Charlotte City Council members that the State would \nlikely take immediate action to put a halt to the Charlotte Ordinance—even as Gov. \nMcCrory conceded that was an exceedingly unusual step. In an email to Charlotte City \nCouncil members, Gov. McCrory noted that he “made a point as the former 14 year \nMayor and current Governor to stay out of specific issues being voted on by the Charlotte \nCity Council.” Gov. McCrory nonetheless characterized the Charlotte Ordinance’s non-\ndiscrimination protections for LGBT people as “changing basic long-established values \n50 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 50 of 104\n\nand norms” surrounding “public restrooms,” and he ominously warned of “possible \ndanger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.” \nGov. McCrory said that the Charlotte Ordinance would “most likely cause immediate \nState legislative intervention which I would support as governor.”    \n206.  On Tuesday, February 23, 2016, Speaker Moore issued a press release \nannouncing that he would work with fellow Republicans to explore a “legislative \nintervention to correct [Charlotte’s] radical course.” \n207.  In North Carolina, it is the state’s Governor who typically calls a special \nsession but, in this case, Gov. McCrory refused to call a special session because he was \nconcerned that the legislature would go beyond addressing the Charlotte Ordinance. \n208.  As a result of Gov. McCrory’s refusal to call a special session, legislative \nleaders opted for a rarely used law that allows special sessions when three-fifths of \nlegislators in both chambers support the call. That provision in the state constitution had \nnot been used since 1981, according to Lt. Governor Dan Forest’s chief of staff, Hal \nWeatherman. The special session cost approximately $42,000 to convene.  \n209.  The text of H.B. 2, which was named the “Public Facilities Privacy and \nSecurity Act,” was not shared with most legislators until they arrived to debate the bill. \n210.  North Carolina House of Representatives Minority Leader Larry Hall \n(“Minority Leader Hall”) stated “We don’t know what we’re discussing here, we don’t \nknow what we’re voting on. What we’re doing is a perversion of the process.” \n51 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 51 of 104\n\n211.  Minority Leader Hall said that Democrats were initially told that the special \nsession would take place on Thursday, March 24, 2016, when instead the special session \nwas held on March 23, 2016. Minority Leader Hall stated that, as a result, a number of \nlegislators were “caught off guard” and were “scrambling to try to come back” for the \nsession. \n212.  The special session, which lasted a single day, was substantially shorter \nthan previous special sessions. Before H.B. 2 had been filed, Speaker Moore announced \nthat the committee hearing for the bill would begin five minutes after introduction of the \nbill and adjournment of the morning session. Shortly thereafter, and approximately \ntwelve minutes after the House came to order, H.B. 2 was filed—the first time it was \nofficially made available to the public or most legislators.  \n213.  Approximately three minutes after H.B. 2 was filed, the chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary IV Committee—the committee to which H.B. 2 was assigned—stated, in \nresponse to a fellow member’s question, that it was his “intention” to permit time for \npublic comment on the bill during the committee hearing. Plaintiffs are informed and \nbelieve, and on that basis allege, that no prior public notice of the time and place for \npublic comment on H.B. 2 was provided. \n214.  Only forty-five minutes were allotted for public comment, which was \ninsufficient to permit those who had signed up to speak on H.B. 2 to be heard. \n52 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 52 of 104\n\n215.  In response to complaints during the committee hearing that members had \nnot been given an opportunity to read the text of H.B. 2, the chairman permitted a five-\nminute break to allow members to read the bill. \n216.  After a favorable referral from the House Judiciary IV Committee, H.B. 2 \nreceived only three hours of debate in the House, after which it was passed and referred \nto the Senate. \n217.  The roll call for H.B. 2 in the Senate was called after all Democratic \nmembers of the Senate walked out of the chambers in protest, with North Carolina State \nSenate Democratic Leader Dan Blue calling the special session an “affront to democracy” \nand stating that the Democratic caucus in the Senate “choose[s] not to participate in this \nfarce.” With every Democratic member absent, the Senate passed H.B. 2 unanimously. \n218.  Comments made by lawmakers both during the debate, in the press, and \nthrough their social media used vitriolic language to make clear their aim at undoing \nCharlotte’s protections for LGBT people: \na.  Descriptions of the legislature’s work by North Carolina State \nSenate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (“Sen. Berger”) included:   \ni.  “Senate unanimously votes to stop radical ordinance allowing \nmen into public bathrooms with women and young girls.” \nii.  “Lawmakers were forced to come back to session to address \nthe serious safety concerns created by the dangerous ordinance—which violated existing \nstate criminal trespass law, indecent exposure law and building codes and created a \n53 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 53 of 104\n\nloophole that any man with nefarious motives could use to prey on women and young \nchildren. . . .” \niii.  “How many fathers are now going to be forced to go to the \nladies’ room to make sure their little girls aren’t molested?” \nb.  North Carolina State Senator Buck Newton said, “The Charlotte City \nCouncil should have never passed this unlawful and reckless bathroom and locker room \nordinance. Politics have reached a new extreme when a municipality’s top priority is \nallowing men into women’s bathrooms and locker rooms. But tens of thousands of our \nconstituents from across the state have called on us to stand up to the political correctness \nmob, fight for common sense and put a stop to this nonsense once and for all.” \nc.  North Carolina State Senator David Curtis (“Sen. Curtis”) said, \n“This liberal group is trying to redefine everything about our society. Gender and \nmarriage — just the whole liberal agenda.” Sen. Curtis added that, while “[w]e generally \ndon’t get involved in local politics[,] [w]e need to do what’s right.” Sen. Curtis said that \nH.B. 2 was necessary because, “The gays would go into a business, make some \noutrageous demand that they know the owner cannot comply with and file a lawsuit \nagainst that business owner and put him out of business.” Sen. Curtis suggested that H.B. \n2 was broadly drafted specifically for the purpose of defending its restroom provision in \ncourt: “[w]e feel like we can successfully defend the law and the fact that we made the \nlaw much broader,” explaining that “[i]n addition to the bathroom issue we restricted the \n54 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 54 of 104\n\nrights of cities and towns to impose a higher minimum wage. The bill has to do with \nrestricting rights of cities and counties. I suspect we will defend it based on that.” \nd.  North Carolina State Senator Andrew Brock said, “You know, \n$42,000 is not going to cover the medical expenses when a pervert walks into a bathroom \nand my little girls are in there.”  \ne.  Speaker Moore said, “They want to protect adults who feel \ncompelled to dress up like the opposite sex. I, on the other hand, oppose the ordinance to \nprotect children, who from the time they’ve been potty trained, know to go into the \nbathroom of their god given appropriate gender. Honestly, it’s ridiculous we are even \nhaving this discussion. I look forward to invalidating this ordinance as soon as possible.” \nf.  North Carolina State Representative Mark Brody (“Rep. Brody”) \nsaid Charlotte’s ordinance “violates my Christian values and it violates decency values,” \nadding that he “had to stop it.” Rep. Brody further stated that “[t]he homosexual \ncommunity has just stepped too far and that had to stop and that’s my basic opinion,” \nnoting that “[t]his is driven by the homosexual community and they’re emboldened by \ntheir victory in the courts on homosexual marriage.” Rep. Brody elaborated further that \nH.B. 2 “sends a message to these municipalities who have been taken over by the liberal, \nhomosexual, prohomosexual ideology that we are going to stick up for traditional values \nand we’ll stick up for them constantly if that’s what we have to do.” \ng.  North Carolina State Representative John Blust opined that he \n“think[s] it’s ridiculous that your anatomy isn’t what governs what restroom you use,” \n55 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 55 of 104\n\nadding that he does not “understand why they have to make way for this .0001 percent of \nthe population.” \n219.  Debate in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly focused \nspecifically on reversing the Charlotte Ordinance, with lawmakers in both chambers \ncondemning the anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people, including provisions \nprotecting transgender individuals’ right to use facilities in accordance with their gender \nidentity.  \n220.  Fewer than 10 hours after it was introduced, H.B. 2 passed both houses. \nGov. McCrory signed the bill that same night, issuing a signing statement making clear \nonce again that H.B. 2 targets transgender people, whose gender identity North Carolina \ndisrespects. His signing statement said, “This radical breach of trust and security under \nthe false argument of equal access not only impacts the citizens of Charlotte but people \nwho come to Charlotte to work, visit or play. This new government regulation defies \ncommon sense and basic community norms by allowing, for example, a man to use a \nwoman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.” H.B. 2 took effect immediately.  \n221.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, Gov. McCrory issued Executive Order \nNo. 93, dated April 12, 2016. Among other provisions, the order affirmed that “[u]nder \ncurrent law, every multiple occupancy restroom, locker room, or shower facility located \nin a cabinet agency must be designated for and only used by persons based on their \nbiological sex,” and that “restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities in public \nbuildings, including our schools” would be maintained by the State “on the basis of \n56 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 56 of 104\n\nbiological sex.” In a press release and video statement accompanying Executive Order \nNo. 93, the governor stated that the Executive Order “[m]aintains . . . gender-specific \nrestroom and locker room facilities in government buildings and schools.”   \n222.  Executive Order No. 93 also required that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-760 (H.B. \n2, Section 1.3) be interpreted consistent with the following guidance: “[w]hen a private \nentity leases State real property and the property in the lessee’s exclusive possession \nincludes multiple occupancy restrooms, locker rooms or other like facilities, the private \nentity will control the signage and use of these facilities.” \nD.  H.B. 2 Is Replaced By H.B. 142—Another Law Whose Legislative \nHistory Establishes That It Was Enacted For The Same Invidious \nPurposes. \n \n223.  H.B. 2’s rank discrimination generated an immense public backlash against \nthe state. \na.  In July 2016, the National Basketball Association announced that it \nwas withdrawing the February 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte, in protest over \nH.B. 2.  \nb.  As a result of H.B. 2, the states of California, Connecticut, \nMinnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington, and numerous cities, including \nAtlanta, Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York City, Portland (Oregon), Salt Lake City, San \nFrancisco, Seattle, and, Washington, D.C. barred publicly-funded travel to North \nCarolina.  \n57 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 57 of 104\n\nc.  The Associated Press estimated in March 2017 that H.B. 2 cost \nNorth Carolina over $3.76 billion in total lost economic activity.  \n224.  Gov. McCrory lost the November 2016 North Carolina gubernatorial \nelection to Gov. Cooper.  \n225.  In a victory speech delivered in early December, then-Governor-Elect \nCooper announced his intention to secure the repeal of H.B. 2.  \n226.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, even \nbefore his inauguration, then-Governor-Elect Cooper attempted to negotiate with \nmembers of the North Carolina General Assembly and the Charlotte City Council to \neffect the repeal of H.B. 2.  \n227.  On December 19, 2016, without public notice, and as part of an apparent \ndeal to secure the repeal of H.B. 2, the Charlotte City Council repealed the non-\ndiscrimination provisions of the Charlotte Ordinance as well as other provisions of city \nlaw that had been pre-empted by H.B. 2. In a resolution, the Charlotte City Council noted \nthat H.B. 2 had “preempted the City’s authority to enact ordinances th[at] prohibit \ndiscrimination and invalidated the City’s non-discrimination ordinance.”   \n228.  The Charlotte City Council’s perception that the repeal of the Charlotte \nOrdinance was linked to repeal of H.B. 2 is evident from the face of its December 19, \n2016 enactment, which stated that repeal of the Charlotte Ordinance was made \nconditional on the explicit repeal of H.B. 2: “[S]hould S.L. 2016-3 not be repealed in its \nentirety by December 31, 2016, this ordinance shall not be valid.”   \n58 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 58 of 104\n\n229.  Following the Charlotte City Council’s vote, then-Governor-Elect Cooper \nissued a statement outlining his understanding of the proposed arrangement: \nSenate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a \nresult of Charlotte’s vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal HB \n2 in full. I hope they will keep their word to me and with the help of Democrats in \nthe legislature, HB 2 will be repealed in full. \n \n230.  That same day, Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore issued a joint statement \nthat “For months, we’ve said if Charlotte would repeal its bathroom ordinance that \ncreated the problem, we would take up the repeal of HB2.”   \n231.  In response to the Charlotte City Council’s repeal bill, Gov. McCrory also \npromised to call a special session of the legislature to repeal H.B. 2, noting that he had \npromised to do so if the Charlotte Ordinance were repealed: “I promised months ago if \nthe Charlotte ordinance was repealed I would call our general assembly into special \nsession to reconsider existing state legislation passed earlier this year and I’m doing just \nthat for this Wednesday.” \n232.  Gov. McCrory called a special session of the legislature, to convene on \nDecember 21, 2016, with the sole purpose of repealing H.B. 2.  \n233.  In the morning before the special session was convened, in response to \ncriticisms that its December 19, 2016 enactment did not sufficiently repeal the Charlotte \nOrdinance, the Charlotte City Council convened to enact a new law that repealed the \nCharlotte Ordinance in its entirety.  \n234.  On December 21, the North Carolina General Assembly convened in a \nspecial session with the sole purpose of repealing H.B. 2.  \n59 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 59 of 104\n\n235.  During the special session, a bill (S.B. 3) was introduced by North Carolina \nState Senator Jeff Jackson that would have repealed H.B. 2, without more. The “clean \nrepeal” bill was referred to a committee, where it was never considered. \n236.  The legislature subsequently adjourned without repealing H.B. 2. \n237.   Gov. Cooper assumed office on January 1, 2017. \n238.  The 2017 regular session of the General Assembly began January 11, 2017. \n239.  From the time he assumed office until the present, Gov. Cooper has failed \nto amend or rescind Executive Order No. 93, which was issued by then-Governor \nMcCrory.  \n240.  During the regular legislative session, “clean repeal” bills (H.B. 82 and \nS.B. 84) were again introduced. The bills were referred to committees, where they were \nnever considered. \n241.  In early 2017, the NCAA began finalizing its selection of venues to host \ncollege sports championships through the year 2022. North Carolina had submitted 133 \nbids for such events. In late March 2017, the NCAA announced that, unless H.B. 2 was \nrepealed by March 30, 2017, North Carolina would be ineligible to host any \nchampionships until 2022. \n242.  On March 29, 2017, at approximately 10:30 p.m., leadership from the \nNorth Carolina General Assembly announced a deal to repeal H.B. 2. About an hour \nlater, the text of H.B. 142 was released.  \n60 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 60 of 104\n\n243.  On March 30, 2017, H.B. 142 was introduced. The Senate, using a process \nsometimes referred to as “gut and amend,” took up an unrelated bill that had already \npassed the House, removed the existing language and replaced it with the text of what is \nnow H.B. 142. \n244.  The bill was the subject of limited debate as it progressed rapidly through \nthe General Assembly, and neither the full House nor the full Senate heard public \ncomment before putting the legislation to a vote. H.B. 142 was passed by the Senate at \napproximately 11:30 a.m., and by the House at approximately 1:30 p.m. The House \napproved the bill with a concurrence vote, and no amendments were permitted. By late \nafternoon, the bill was signed by Gov. Cooper. \n245.  H.B. 142 was promoted as a repeal of H.B. 2 to attract business back to \nNorth Carolina but only passed through the General Assembly because, like H.B. 2, it \ncontinued to discriminate against transgender individuals with respect to the use of \nsingle-sex, multiple-user facilities, and continued to bar local government protections for \nLGBT people.  \n246.  Lawmakers made it clear in the press and through their social media that \nH.B. 2’s ban on transgender individuals using restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-\nuser facilities matching their gender identity remained under H.B. 142: \na.  North Carolina State Senator Joyce Krawiec said, “My primary \nconcern is protecting the safety and privacy of women and children \n61 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 61 of 104\n\nin bathrooms, locker rooms and changing facilities. This bill \nmaintains those protections.” \nb.  North Carolina State Senator Danny Britt said that “[r]epeal of HB2 \ndoes not allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their \nchoosing.” He further stated that “[t]here is already a law on the \nbooks, if you go into a restroom other than that of your biological \ngender, it is second-degree trespassing.”  \nc.  Speaker Moore said that “House Bill 142 ensures that persons of the \nopposite sex cannot go into designated multi-occupancy restrooms, \nshowers and changing rooms by preempting local governments to \npreserve the authority of North Carolina criminal law on trespassing, \nindecent exposure and peeping.” He also stated that H.B. 142 \n“accomplishes the same goal [as H.B. 2], but the way it is set up it’s \nmuch more defensible.” \nd.  North Carolina State Representative Brenden Jones opined that, \nunder H.B. 142, “the restroom provision of HB2 remains and our \nchildren will not be forced to share bathrooms with those of the \nopposite sex.” \ne.  North Carolina State Representative Chuck McGrady said that, “In \nthe days since the passage of HB 142 what I’ve been most often \nasked is whether the bill weakens protections for vulnerable people, \n62 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 62 of 104\n\nlike women and children, in bathrooms, locker rooms, and changing \nrooms. No, it does not. The state’s criminal laws are applicable, \nspecially [sic] criminal provisions like second degree trespassing, \nindecent exposure and/or peeping.”   \nf.  North Carolina State Representative Chuck Szoka stated, “I voted \n‘aye’ on 142 because it kept the two most important things from \nHB2 in law, and in my opinion, even stronger.” According to the \nFayetteville Observer, Szoka also explained that “[t]he reset law tells \nmunicipalities they don’t have the authority to pass an ordinance \nsuch as Charlotte’s . . . and it continues to protect the safety and \nprivacy of women and children in restrooms and changing rooms.” \nE.  H.B. 142, Like H.B. 2 Before It, Harms Transgender People. \n247.  H.B. 2 amended North Carolina’s General Statutes to mandate that school \nboards require students to use restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities in \naccordance with their so-called “biological sex” providing that,  \nLocal boards of education shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used \nonly by students based on their biological sex. \n \n248.  H.B. 2 also imposed the same mandate on all executive branch agencies \n(which are expressly defined to include Defendant University of North Carolina), and all \npublic agencies, providing that they \nshall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be \ndesignated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex.  \n63 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 63 of 104\n\n \n249.  Each of those provisions defined “biological sex” as follows, \n   \nBiological sex. – The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated \non a person’s birth certificate.  \n \n250.  Changing the gender marker on one’s birth certificate is not a viable option \nfor many transgender people, as every jurisdiction has a different set of often onerous and \nunnecessary requirements for updating the gender listed on a birth certificate, if they \npermit that to be done at all. \n251.  For instance, a person born in North Carolina can only update the gender \nmarker listed on a North Carolina-issued birth certificate with proof of certain surgeries \nthat may not be medically necessary, advisable, or affordable for any given person. \nMeanwhile, a person born in neighboring Tennessee can never change the gender listed \non a Tennessee-issued birth certificate. \n252.  Medical treatment such as the surgery required to update a person’s North \nCarolina birth certificate does not alter a person’s gender, but rather merely brings a \nperson’s body into alignment with their gender identity. Gender identity is what governs \nhow people live and express their gender regardless of the sex they were assigned at \nbirth. \n253.  Both the intent and effect of H.B 2 was to target transgender individuals for \ndiscrimination. H.B. 2’s provisions requiring use of single-sex, multiple-user facilities in \naccordance with the sex stated on an individual’s birth certificate facially targeted \ntransgender people through a definition of “biological sex” meant only to exclude \n64 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 64 of 104\n\ntransgender individuals from restrooms and locker rooms. In addition, lawmakers made \nclear that H.B. 2 was specifically aimed at transgender people. For example, an FAQ \nreleased by Gov. McCrory after H.B. 2’s enactment states, “Why did North Carolina pass \nthis law in the first place? Answer: The bill was passed after the Charlotte City Council \nvoted to impose a regulation requiring businesses to allow a man into a women’s \nrestroom, shower, or locker room if they choose.” The Charlotte Ordinance did not do \nthat. It only permitted a transgender woman to use a women’s restroom or other multiple-\nuser facility for women and a transgender man to use a men’s restroom or other multiple-\nuser facility for men.  \n254.  Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, it was already illegal for a person to enter a \nrestroom or locker room to assault or injure another. Moreover, protecting transgender \npeople from discrimination in public accommodations, as has been done in numerous \nstates and hundreds of localities, has resulted in no increase in public safety incidents in \nany jurisdiction anywhere in the United States, and including transgender people in \npublic life in no way impacts the safety or well-being of non-transgender people. \n255.  The painful message of stigma sent by H.B. 2 echoes the dehumanizing \nrhetoric employed by a number of lawmakers, suggesting that transgender people are \nsomehow predatory or dangerous to others. To the contrary, it was H.B. 2 that exposed \ntransgender people to harassment and potential violence. Transgender people are already \ndisproportionately targeted for physical violence and harassment in North Carolina and \nacross the country. When a transgender person is forced to disclose their transgender \n65 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 65 of 104\n\nstatus to strangers, such disclosure puts them at a high risk for violence. H.B. 2’s \nrequirement that transgender people be shunted into single-sex, multiple-user spaces that \ndo not match their gender identity invaded their privacy and exposed this vulnerable \npopulation to harassment and potential violence by others. Numerous legislators stated \nthat H.B. 142 continues that requirement. \n256.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, after the \nenactment of H.B. 2, some school officials who had been respecting their students’ \ngender identity without any problem called parents to say that their children would be \nforced out of the single-sex facilities that match their gender identity.  \n257.  H.B. 2’s broad sweep meant that the same result applied to executive and \npublic agencies, including routine places such as libraries, public health centers, airports, \nand the Division of Motor Vehicles, as well as places where people may have turned in \ntimes of crisis, such as state hospitals, police departments, and courthouses. Transgender \nindividuals working in such agencies may not have been able to safely use any restroom \nany longer, threatening their ability to keep their job when H.B. 2 was in effect. \n258.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, Defendant Spellings issued a \nmemorandum dated April 5, 2016 to chancellors of constituent UNC schools, including \nUNC-Chapel Hill, UNC-Greensboro, and UNCSA-HS. The memorandum specifically \nstated that “University institutions must require every multiple-occupancy bathroom and \nchanging facility to be designated for and used only by persons based on their biological \nsex.” The memorandum included a copy of H.B. 2, which included its definition of \n66 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 66 of 104\n\n“biological sex.” The same memo directed constituent schools to “fully meet their \nobligations under the Act.”   \n259.  The following week, Defendant Spellings issued public comments \nproviding unequivocal guidance that “the University is bound to comply with HB2.” On \nMay 9, 2016, on the University of North Carolina’s behalf, Defendant Spellings further \nstated to representatives of the United States Department of Justice that “[H.B. 2] remains \nthe law of the State . . . and the University has no independent power to change that legal \nreality.” \n260.  H.B. 2’s restroom ban also deterred transgender people from participating \nin the state and local democratic process. It banned them from using the restroom \nconsistent with their gender identity when visiting the North Carolina General Assembly, \npetitioning their legislator, or entering any building operated by the legislative branch. It \nlikewise banned them from using restrooms consistent with their gender identity when \nvisiting the Governor’s mansion, the Governor’s office, or other offices operated by the \nexecutive branch. It further banned them from using the restroom consistent with their \ngender identity at a city council meeting or at a city council member’s or mayor’s office. \n261.  H.B. 2’s harms extended even farther, creating conflicts between state law \nand various federal laws. The conflict with Title IX, for example, put at risk the more \nthan $4.5 billion in federal education funding that North Carolina was expected to receive \nin 2016. H.B. 2 also led to potential financial penalties under Executive Orders 11246 \nand 13672, which prohibit federal contractors (such as the University of North Carolina) \n67 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 67 of 104\n\nfrom barring transgender employees from the restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity. In addition, to the extent they complied with H.B. 2, public employers subject to \nTitle VII violated the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s decree that \ndiscriminating against transgender people with respect to restroom use is impermissible \nsex discrimination under that law. Public hospitals that receive federal funding also \nviolated Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act if they complied with H.B. 2.  \n262.  The enactment of H.B. 2 followed a history of discrimination by decision-\nmakers against transgender people, including, for example, Gov. McCrory’s participation \nin a Fourth Circuit amicus curiae brief arguing that a transgender student’s request to \naccess restrooms in accordance with his gender identity is “radical.”   \n263.  H.B. 142 provides in part that: \nState agencies, boards, offices, departments, institutions, branches of government, \nincluding The University of North Carolina and the North Carolina Community \nCollege System, and political subdivisions of the State, including local boards of \neducation, are preempted from regulation of access to multiple occupancy \nrestrooms, showers, or changing facilities, except in accordance with an act of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n \n264.  No “act of the General Assembly” currently regulates access to restrooms \nand other single-sex, multiple-user facilities.  \n265.  The intent and effect of this provision of H.B. 142 is to perpetuate H.B. 2’s \ndiscrimination against transgender people by creating a regulatory vacuum that serves to \ndeter transgender individuals from using single-sex, multiple-user restrooms that are \nconsistent with their gender identity.  \n266.  Under H.B. 142, public entities that traditionally regulate restroom, shower, \n68 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 68 of 104\n\nand changing facility use are barred from providing guidance about which facilities \ntransgender people are permitted to use or are prohibited from using.  \n267.  In fact, the plain language of H.B. 142 goes so far as to bar public entities \nfrom all “regulation of access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing \nfacilities.” Under the statute’s plain language, even maintaining separate men’s and \nwomen’s rooms or the posting of any signs restricting use of the facilities to “men” or \n“women” would appear to be unlawful, although, upon information and belief, neither the \nstate government nor any operator of a state government building in North Carolina is \ncurrently enforcing H.B. 142 to that effect. \n268.  When considered in light of existing state and local law, the broad and \nvague language of H.B. 142 is designed to deter and effectively does deter transgender \nindividuals from restrooms that accord with who they are and indeed from using \nrestrooms in public buildings altogether.  \n269.  The only thing that transgender individuals know with certainty about their \nright to use restrooms in North Carolina public facilities is that no government official \ncan assure them that they will not face arrest or other penalty for entering a restroom that \naccords with who they are, and the passage of H.B. 142 was designed to accomplish \nexactly that result.  \n270.  Even when prompted by Plaintiffs’ counsel, the University of North \nCarolina has refused to state whether under University policy any of the individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs who originally filed this lawsuit are permitted to use restrooms or \n69 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 69 of 104\n\nother single-sex, multiple-user facilities consistent with their gender identity or whether \nthey will face any penalty for using such facilities.  \n271.  The legislative intervenors—despite being the individuals who drafted and \npassed H.B. 142—have refused to answer questions designed to clarify whether \ntransgender individuals could face any penalty for using restrooms or other single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities consistent with their gender identity.  \n272.  What is clear is that every state agency, branch of government, or local \ngovernment, including the University of North Carolina and its constituent institutions, is \nexpressly forbidden by H.B. 142 from regulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities, which when combined with the statements of North Carolina \nofficials, has the effect of deterring the Plaintiffs who are transgender and other \ntransgender individuals from restrooms that accord with their gender, and therefore deter \nthem from use of any restrooms in public buildings. \n273.  Under H.B. 2, gender designations in restrooms in public buildings and \nother single-sex, multiple-user facilities took on the legal meaning that they permitted \nonly individuals based on their “biological sex,” as defined by H.B. 2. That is, under \nH.B. 2, a sign saying “women’s bathroom” meant, in effect, “biological women only”—\nand “biological sex” was defined for the purpose of excluding transgender individuals \nfrom single-sex, multiple-user spaces.  \n274.  The vacuum purposefully created by H.B. 142 in effect maintains the ban \nof H.B. 2 and encourages discrimination by both government and private entities and \n70 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 70 of 104\n\nindividuals. The law offers no guidance to anyone except by implication and makes it \nimpossible for a reasonable person who is transgender to know which restroom they can \nlegally use. \n275.  H.B. 142 also threatens the safety of transgender individuals.  \n276.  Even before the enactment of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, transgender individuals \nwere already disproportionately subject to harassment and violence, particularly in sex-\nseparated settings. By falsely portraying transgender individuals as a threat to others and \ndenying them the safety that comes from a governing legal authority’s recognition of \ntheir gender identity and right to legal protections, both H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 heighten the \nrisk of violence and harassment against transgender individuals.  \n277.  Comments by state legislators confirm that H.B. 142’s provision \npreempting regulation of restrooms and other multiple-user facilities was, in fact, \nintended to deter transgender individuals from single-sex facilities that match their \ngender identity. Indeed, as described above, numerous legislators have described \nH.B. 142 as having the effect of leaving Part I of H.B. 2 in place. \n278.  The legislative history of H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 demonstrates that the \npurpose of H.B. 142’s provision preempting regulation of restroom and other single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities was to discriminate against transgender individuals. The General \nAssembly intended that H.B. 2’s discriminatory mandate be replaced with a provision \nthat continued to discriminate against transgender individuals and mark them as a threat \n71 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 71 of 104\n\nto the safety and privacy of others—as evidenced by the direct statements by legislators \nand others to that effect, and the fact that the legislature refused to cleanly repeal H.B. 2. \n279.  Lawmakers repeatedly made clear that H.B. 2, and now H.B. 142, would be \nenforced through the criminal trespass statute, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-159.13, which \nprovides that a person “commits the offense of second degree trespass if, without \nauthorization, he enters or remains on the premises of another . . . [a]fter he has been \nnotified not to enter or remain there by the owner, by a person in charge of the premises, \nby a lawful occupant, or by another authorized person.” That is, the discrimination that \nH.B. 2 invited and encouraged can now result in potential criminal consequences for \ntransgender individuals given the permanent legal uncertainty that is created and \nperpetuated by H.B. 142.  \n280.  Before H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, transgender individuals were capable of \nbenefitting from, or advocating for, policies or informal practices at state agencies or \nlocal governments that protected their rights to use restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity. H.B. 142 bars such policies or assurances.  \n281.  Before H.B. 2, an ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity or gender expression could be interpreted to require that transgender \nindividuals be guaranteed access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity. \nWhile, under H.B. 142, state agencies and local governments may enact such anti-\ndiscrimination policies with regard to their own employees or students, such policies \nautomatically contain an exclusion under H.B. 142 to the extent that they would apply to \n72 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 72 of 104\n\nrestrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities. This undermines the entire concept \nof anti-discrimination protections based on gender identity or expression, in the same \nway that it would undermine protections based on sexual orientation to permit \ndiscrimination in access to marriage. \n282.  Plaintiffs’ own experiences demonstrate the harm of this perpetual legal \nuncertainty. Plaintiffs understandably experience fear, anxiety, and physical symptoms \nwhen they are unable to safely use the restroom—as when, e.g., Mr. Carcaño is required \nto travel to other state agencies such as the North Carolina Department of Health and \nHuman Services as part of his job. He cannot ask which restroom to use for fear of being \nouted as transgender but runs the risk of arrest or other penalty if he is perceived to be \ntransgender and in the “wrong” restroom—which under the current state of the law could \nbe in either restroom. This causes him to delay or even avoid restroom use altogether, \nwhich can lead to severe health consequences. \nF.  H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 Harm Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals, as \nwell as Transgender Individuals. \n \n283.  H.B. 2 disproportionately burdened lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, \nas well as transgender individuals, by stripping them of or barring them from obtaining \nanti-discrimination projections under local law. H.B. 2 took aim at the Charlotte \nOrdinance in a section providing,    \nThe General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in \nemployment is properly an issue of general, statewide concern, such that this \nArticle and other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and \npreempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a \nunit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or \n73 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 73 of 104\n\nimposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of \ndiscriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to \npersonnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law. \n \n284.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, the City Attorney of the City of \nCharlotte issued a memorandum dated April 1, 2016 to the Mayor and City Council of \nthe City of Charlotte, regarding the effect of H.B. 2 on the Charlotte Ordinance and other \ncity laws or policies. The memorandum noted that H.B. 2 “invalidates . . . the February \n22 amendments to the public accommodations ordinance,” and concluded that “[d]ue to \nthe preemption described above, the Community Relations Committee can no longer \nreceive, investigate, and conciliate complaints for violations of the public \naccommodations ordinance.”   \n285.  H.B. 2 stripped lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals of anti-discrimination \nprotections in Charlotte, because no such sexual orientation anti-discrimination \nprotections exist in state law. The preemptive effect of this section did not fall equally on \nall North Carolinians, however.   \n286.  Recognizing that North Carolina law had no statewide public \naccommodations protection of any kind except for people with disabilities, H.B. 2 \nactually enacted a new public accommodations statute—so that the other groups whose \nprotections also would have been preempted under the Charlotte Ordinance were spared \nthat result. The new public accommodations statute prohibits discrimination based on \n“race, religion, color, national origin, or biological sex”—omitting the sexual orientation \n74 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 74 of 104\n\n(as well as the gender identity and gender expression) protections that had been included \nin the Charlotte Ordinance. \n287.  Even prior to H.B. 2, the North Carolina legislature has a history of targeted \ndiscrimination toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. For example, the legislature \napproved and referred to voters a constitutional amendment barring access to marriage \nfor same-sex couples. Legislative leaders also intervened in litigation challenging the \nconstitutionality of the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage pursuant to a statute \nauthorizing them to act on behalf of the General Assembly. In 2015, the legislature also \npassed a bill that allows county magistrates to recuse themselves from performing civil \nmarriages.  \n288.  The preemptive effect of H.B. 2 also harmed transgender people. While the \nCharlotte Ordinance had prohibited discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and \ngender expression, the new public accommodations statute restricted its protections \nsolely to “biological sex,” which is defined in an effort to deliberately exclude \ntransgender people from protection.  \n289.  Like H.B. 2, H.B. 142 intentionally targets and disproportionately burdens \nlesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, as well as transgender individuals, by continuing \nto strip them of or bar them from obtaining anti-discrimination projections under local \nlaw. H.B. 142 does so through its provision stating, \nNo local government in this State may enact or amend an ordinance regulating \nprivate employment practices or regulating public accommodations. \n \n75 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 75 of 104\n\n290.  Under the terms of H.B. 142, its provision preempting local non-\ndiscrimination ordinances expires “on December 1, 2020.”   \n291.  As with H.B. 2’s preemption provision, the preemptive effect of H.B. 142 \ndoes not fall equally on all North Carolinians. Rather, the law’s intent to burden and \nstigmatize LGBT individuals for a legal disability is evident not only from the statute’s \nlegislative history, but also from the fact that H.B. 142 does not purport to preempt all \nlocal non-discrimination ordinances. Rather, H.B. 142 prevents only the passage of new \nnon-discrimination ordinances, until December 1, 2020.  \n292.  Pre-existing local non-discrimination ordinances covering prohibited \ngrounds of discrimination such as race, sex, or religion continue to be valid under \nH.B. 142. For example, the day that H.B. 142 was passed, the City of Charlotte issued a \nstatement emphasizing that H.B. 142 “reinstates Charlotte’s non-discrimination ordinance \nas it read prior to [the Charlotte Ordinance],” thus once again outlawing discrimination \nbased on “race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.”   \n293.  The effect of H.B. 142 is thus that no protections in public accommodations \nor private employment based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression \nexist in either state or local law in North Carolina, while protections based on other \ncategories (including categories that may not be explicitly protected in state or federal \nlaw) are maintained and permitted in many parts of the state.  \n294.  That the preemption of local non-discrimination ordinances in H.B. 142 is a \npretext for discrimination against LGBT individuals is evident from the fact that the state \n76 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 76 of 104\n\ncannot seriously articulate an interest in uniform state-wide application of discrimination \nlaw. That is so because (1) with the repeal of H.B. 2, there are no longer any statewide \npublic accommodations protections of any kind except for people with disabilities; (2) as \ndescribed above, H.B. 142 leaves in place pre-existing local government non-\ndiscrimination ordinances; (3) H.B. 142 does not preempt local governments, school \nboards, universities, or other state agencies or branches of government from enacting \nnon-discrimination rules or regulations with regard to their own employees, or with \nrespect to the services that they provide to citizens; (4) H.B. 142’s “preemption” is \nspecifically designed to end in December 2020. In addition, there is no greater need for \nstatewide uniformity with respect to antidiscrimination laws than there is with respect to \nnumerous other laws as to which North Carolina does not prohibit local regulation and as \nto which there are significant differences in regulations of conduct among different parts \nof the state—such as, for example, local sales tax laws. \nG.  If The Repeal of H.B. 2 Is Found Inseverable From The \nUnconstitutional Provisions Of H.B. 142, H.B. 2 Will Once Again \nHarm LGBT Individuals. \n \n295.  If this Court were to conclude that (1) one or more provisions of H.B. 142 \nare unconstitutional or violate federal law and (2) the provision of H.B. 142 repealing \nH.B. 2 is not severable from H.B. 142’s unlawful provisions, then the effect of its ruling \nmay be to restore H.B. 2 to legal operation.  \n296.  If H.B. 2 were restored to legal operation, the discrimination and \nstigmatization that it inflicted on LGBT individuals through its provisions relating to \n77 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 77 of 104\n\nsingle-sex, multiple-user facilities and preemption of local non-discrimination ordinances \nwould again be imposed upon LGBT individuals, including Plaintiffs.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n \nDeprivation of Substantive Due Process \n(Part II of H.B. 142)  \n \nU.S. Const.

As used in this Count, references to H.B. 142 (or Part II thereof) include \nnot only H.B 142 (or Part II thereof) standing alone, but also H.B. 142 (or Part II thereof) \nacting or operating in conjunction with any other “act of the General Assembly,” \nincluding but not limited to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-159.13. \n299.  Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and \nACLU of NC against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon.  \n300.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, \nStein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon in their official capacities for purposes of seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 142 both facially and as applied to \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and ACLU of NC. \n78 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 78 of 104\n\n301.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, places limitations on state action that deprives individuals \nof life, liberty, or property.  \nA.  Void for Vagueness  \n \n302.  Substantive protections of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process \nClause require that civil and criminal statutes must be articulated with sufficient \ndefiniteness that (1) ordinary persons may understand what conduct is prohibited, and (2) \nthe statutes do not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \n303.  H.B. 142 purposefully creates and perpetuates a ban on restroom regulation \nand use but provides no guidance on what conduct may be subject to criminal or other \npenalty.  \n304.  Under H.B. 142, local governments, school boards, public universities, and \nother state agencies or branches of government are forbidden from regulating access to \nrestrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities “except in accordance with an act of \nthe General Assembly.”   \n305.  No “act of the General Assembly,” however, currently provides clarity \nregarding whether transgender individuals will be subject to criminal or other penalty if \nthey use restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities, or currently empowers \nlocal governments, school boards, public universities, and other state agencies or \nbranches of government to provide such clarity or to otherwise regulate “access to \nmultiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities.” \n79 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 79 of 104\n\n306.  North Carolina law, however, does provide that a person “commits the \noffense of second degree trespass if, without authorization, he enters or remains on the \npremises of another . . . [a]fter he has been notified not to enter or remain there by the \nowner, by a person in charge of the premises, by a lawful occupant, or by another \nauthorized person.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-159.13. \n307.  H.B. 142 provides no way for transgender individuals to determine what \nconduct may be subject to criminal or other penalty. Indeed, H.B. 142’s proscription on \n“regulation of access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, \nexcept in accordance with an act of the General Assembly” specifically bars the local \ngovernments, school boards, public universities, and other state agencies or branches of \ngovernment in charge of restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities—the \nentities to whom transgender individuals might turn for such clarity—from providing any \nguidance regarding whether transgender individuals will be penalized for using particular \nrestrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user, facilities in public buildings.  \n308.  H.B. 142 encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement against \ntransgender individuals—including discrimination by private individuals. This is \nparticularly so in light of (1) H.B. 2’s discriminatory mandate—previously applicable \nstatewide—which required that transgender individuals use facilities consistent with their \nso-called “biological sex,” (2) the statements by lawmakers that H.B. 142 preserves \nH.B. 2’s discriminatory mandate, and (3) the fact that, as a matter of practice, most \nrestrooms in public buildings and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities continue to be \n80 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 80 of 104\n\ndesignated for a particular gender.  \nB.  Substantive Due Process  \n \n309.  Substantive protections of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process \nClause provide that the state may not deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property in a \nmanner that is arbitrary and capricious or that lacks a rational basis, or through means \nthat are insufficiently related to the ends of the law. \n310.  As set forth above, H.B. 142 purposefully creates and perpetuates a \npermanent state of legal uncertainty regarding whether transgender individuals are \nsubject to criminal or other penalty if they use restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-\nuser facilities, by (1) failing to provide any clarity or guidance under state law, and (2) \nforbidding local governments, school boards, universities, and other state agencies from \nproviding such clarity or guidance.  \n311.  H.B. 142 is inherently arbitrary and capricious in that—by creating a \npermanent state of legal uncertainty regarding whether transgender individuals are \nsubject to criminal or other penalty if they use restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-\nuser facilities—it mandates arbitrary and capricious treatment with respect to access to \nrestrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities.  \n312.  The creation of a permanent state of legal uncertainty such as the one \nperpetuated by H.B. 142 cannot be justified by any state interest. H.B. 142 is not \nnarrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a compelling state \ninterest, nor is it even rationally related to any legitimate state interest. \n81 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 81 of 104\n\nCOUNT II \n \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n(Parts II, III, and IV of H.B. 142) \n \nU.S. Const.

Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, \nStein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon in their official capacities for purposes of seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 142 both facially and as applied to \nPlaintiffs. \n315.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \nA.   Discrimination Based on Sex and Transgender Status in Preemption of \nLocal Ordinances Regulating Access to Restrooms or Other Single-Sex, \nMultiple-User Facilities (Part II of H.B. 142) \n \n316.  Section A of Count II is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, \nGoss, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, \nand Trogdon.  \n317.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict or at \nleast heightened scrutiny.  \n82 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 82 of 104\n\n318.  Discrimination on the basis of sex includes, but is not limited to, \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, gender identity, \ntransgender status, and gender transition. \n319.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on transgender status is presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto heightened scrutiny.  \n320.  H.B. 142 was motivated by an intent to treat transgender people differently, \nand worse, than other people, including by (1) stripping them of the benefits of any \npolicies or practices in place at any local government, school board, public university, \nand other state agency or branch of government that would guarantee them the right to \naccess restrooms or other single-sex, multiple-user facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity, and by (2) precluding any local government, school board, public university, and \nother state agency or branch of government from “regulation of access to multiple \noccupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities.”   \n321.  H.B. 142 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging transgender people \nand is based on animus against transgender people. H.B. 142 was also enacted because \nof, and not in spite of, its adverse treatment of transgender people. \n322.  Any justification for H.B. 142’s enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, is pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for H.B. 142. Indeed, bills that would have \n83 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 83 of 104\n\ncleanly repealed H.B. 2 were rejected precisely because they were considered \ninsufficiently discriminatory against transgender individuals.    \n323.  By preventing transgender individuals from advocating before local \ngovernments, school boards, universities, or other state agencies or branches of \ngovernment for guaranteed access to restrooms or other single-user, multiple-user \nfacilities, H.B. 142 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on \ntransgender people than on non-transgender people, who (1) benefitted from the \ndiscriminatory regime under H.B. 2, (2) continue to benefit from the practical reality that \nmost restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities are marked with gendered \nsigns, and (3) are not burdened by the permanent state of legal uncertainty created and \nperpetuated by H.B. 142. H.B. 142 accordingly places a special burden on transgender \npeople within the governmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.  \n324.  H.B. 142 deprives transgender people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, \nand autonomy by continuing to brand them as second-class citizens. \n325.  H.B. 142’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex and \ntransgender status denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nB.   Discrimination Based on Sex, Transgender Status, and Sexual \nOrientation in Preemption of Local Non-Discrimination Protections \n(Parts III and IV of H.B. 142) \n \n326.  Section B of Count II is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, \nGoss, Gilmore, Harper, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Cooper and Stein. \n84 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 84 of 104\n\n327.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex, discrimination based on sexual orientation, and \ndiscrimination based on transgender status are presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto strict or at least heightened scrutiny. \n328.  H.B. 142 deprives LGBT people of protections against discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and transgender status. \n329.  H.B. 142 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and \nworse, than other people, including by precluding any local government from taking \naction to protect LGBT people against discrimination in private employment or places of \npublic accommodation.  \n330.  H.B. 142 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging LGBT people and \nis based on animus against LGBT people. H.B. 142 was also enacted because of, and not \nin spite of, its adverse treatment of LGBT people. This is underscored by the fact that any \ndeal to repeal H.B. 2 was explicitly premised on a prior repeal of the Charlotte \nOrdinance—a law specifically designed to protect individuals from discrimination based \non sexual orientation and gender identity. \n331.  Any justification for H.B. 142’s enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, is pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for the bill. Indeed, the government cannot \nassert an interest in consistent statewide obligations given that (1) H.B. 142 in fact leaves \nin place local government non-discrimination ordinances that were enacted prior to the \n85 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 85 of 104\n\npassage of H.B. 2 (to the extent not otherwise repealed), and cities have announced their \nintent to continue enforcing them; (2) H.B. 142 does not preempt local governments, \nschool boards, universities, or other state agencies or branches of government from \nenacting non-discrimination rules or regulations with regard to their own employees or \nstudents, or with respect to the services that they provide to citizens; (3) H.B. 142’s \n“preemption” is specified to end in December 2020. In addition, there is no greater need \nfor statewide uniformity with respect to antidiscrimination laws than there is with respect \nto numerous other laws as to which North Carolina does not prohibit local regulation and \nas to which there are significant differences in regulations of conduct among different \nparts of the state—such as, for example, local sales tax laws. \n332.  By blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people at the local \nlevel, H.B. 142 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT \npeople than on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based \ndiscrimination. H.B. 142 accordingly places a special burden on LGBT people within the \ngovernmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.  \n333.  H.B. 142 deprives LGBT people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and \nautonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n334.  H.B. 142’s discrimination against LGBT people based on sex, sexual \norientation, and transgender status denies them the equal protection of the laws, in \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n86 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 86 of 104\n\nC.  Discrimination Based on Transgender Status Warrants Strict or At \nLeast Heightened Scrutiny \n \n335.  Transgender people have suffered a long history of extreme discrimination \nin North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such discrimination to \nthis day. \n336.  Transgender people are a discrete and insular group and lack the political \npower to protect their rights through the legislative process. Transgender people have \nlargely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal protections to protect them \nagainst discrimination.  \n337.  A person’s gender identity or transgender status bears no relation to a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society. \n338.  Gender identity is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n339.  Gender identity generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \nD.  Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Warrants Strict or At \nLeast Heightened Scrutiny \n \n340.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people have suffered a long history of extreme \ndiscrimination in North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such \ndiscrimination to this day. \n87 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 87 of 104\n\n341.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are a discrete and insular group and lack \nthe political power to protect their rights through the legislative process. Lesbian, gay, \nand bisexual people have largely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal \nprotections to protect them against discrimination. \n342.  A person’s sexual orientation bears no relation to a person’s ability to \ncontribute to society. \n343.  Sexual orientation is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n344.  Sexual orientation generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \nCOUNT III \n \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n(H.B. 2) \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \n345.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 344 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n346.  Plaintiffs plead this Count solely in the event that this Court finds that (1) \none or more provisions of H.B. 142 are unlawful and (2) the provision of H.B. 142 \nrepealing H.B. 2 is not severable from H.B. 142’s unlawful provisions. \n88 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 88 of 104\n\n347.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against certain Defendants in their \nofficial capacities for purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge \nH.B. 2 both facially and as applied to them. \nA.  Discrimination Based on Sex and Transgender Status in Single-Sex \nRestrooms and Facilities (H.B. 2, Part I) \n \n348.  Section A of Count III is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, \nGoss, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Sanders, Cohen, and \nTrogdon. \n349.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n350.  H.B. 2 discriminated against transgender people on the basis of sex and \nwould again do so if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to be found inseverable from the unlawful \nprovisions of H.B. 142. \n351.  Discrimination based on sex includes, but is not limited to, discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition.  \n352.  H.B. 2 facially classifies people based on sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status. \n353.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on transgender status is presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto strict or at least heightened scrutiny. \n89 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 89 of 104\n\n354.  H.B. 2 treated transgender people differently than non-transgender people \nwho are similarly situated and would again do so if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to be found \ninseverable from the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142. \n355.  Under H.B. 2, non-transgender people were able to access restrooms and \nother single-sex, multiple-user facilities consistent with their gender identity, but \ntransgender people were banned from restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity. \n356.  H.B. 2 discriminated against transgender people based on gender \nnonconformity and would again do so if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to be found inseverable \nfrom the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142. For example, although Mr. Carcaño and Mr. \nMcGarry are men, are perceived as men in public, and have had medical treatment to \nbring their bodies into alignment with their male gender identities, they have birth \ncertificates with female gender markers that do not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for \nmen. Furthermore, if transgender men such as Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry had been \nassigned male at birth, they would not be banned by H.B. 2 from the restrooms and other \nsingle-sex, multiple-user facilities consistent with their gender identity. The same is true \nfor Ms. Schafer, who is a young woman, is perceived as a woman in public, and has had \nmedical treatment to bring her body into alignment with her gender but has a birth \ncertificate that classifies her as male and therefore does not conform to H.B. 2’s \nexpectations for women. Had Ms. Schafer been assigned female at birth, she would not \n90 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 90 of 104\n\nbe banned by H.B. 2 from restrooms and other single-sex, multiple-user facilities \ndesignated for women and girls.  \n357.  No person has any control over the sex that person is assigned at birth. In \nfact, when a person is born with characteristics associated with both male and female \ninfants, the appropriate course is to assign sex based on likely gender identity and to later \nre-assign sex based on gender identity once it is known if it conflicts with the original sex \nassignment.  \n358.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex and \ntransgender status is not substantially related to any compelling or important government \ninterest. Indeed, it is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n359.  H.B. 2 endangers the safety, privacy, security, and well-being of \ntransgender individuals. For example, if a transgender young woman like Ms. Schafer \nwere to use the restroom designated for men and boys, she likely would be harassed and \nmight be assaulted by men or boys who believed that she should not be in that restroom. \nSimilarly, if a transgender man like Mr. Carcaño or Mr. Payton were to use the women’s \nrestroom, he likely would be harassed and might be assaulted by women who believe he \nshould not be in the women’s restroom. \n360.  H.B. 2 does not promote the safety, privacy, security, or well-being of non-\ntransgender people. \n361.  H.B. 2 deprives transgender people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, \nand autonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n91 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 91 of 104\n\n362.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people denies them the equal \nprotection of the laws, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nB.   Discrimination Based on Sex, Transgender Status, and Sexual \nOrientation in Preemption of Local Non-Discrimination Protections \n(H.B. 2, Part II, Sections 2.2 & 2.3; H.B. 2, Part III) \n \n363.  Section B of Count III is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, \nGoss, Gilmore, Harper, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Cooper and Stein.   \n364.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex, discrimination based on sexual orientation, and \ndiscrimination based on transgender status are presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto strict or at least heightened scrutiny. \n365.  H.B. 2 deprived LGBT people of protections against discrimination based \non sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression and—if the repeal of H.B. 2 \nwere to be found inseverable from the other provisions of H.B. 142—would again do so.  \n366.  H.B. 2 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and \nworse, than other people, including by stripping them of the protections afforded by the \nCharlotte Ordinance and precluding any local government from taking action to protect \nLGBT people against discrimination.  \n367.  H.B. 2 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging LGBT people and is \nbased on animus against LGBT people. H.B. 2 was also enacted because of, and not in \nspite of, its adverse treatment of LGBT people. \n92 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 92 of 104\n\n368.  The justifications cited in H.B. 2 for its enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, are pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for the bill. For example, proposals to add \nsexual orientation and gender identity and expression protections to the statewide public \naccommodations law were rejected. \n369.  By blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people at the local \nlevel, H.B. 2 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT people \nthan on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based \ndiscrimination. H.B. 2 accordingly places a special burden on LGBT people within the \ngovernmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.  \n370.  H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and \nautonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n371.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against LGBT people based on sex, transgender \nstatus, and sexual orientation denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n93 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 93 of 104\n\nCOUNT IV \n \nViolation of Right to Privacy \n(H.B. 2) \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon \n \n372.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 371 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n373.  Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and ACLU of NC plead this \nCount against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon solely \nin the event that this Court finds that (1) one or more provisions of H.B. 142 are \nunconstitutional or violate federal law and (2) that the provisions of H.B. 142—including \nits provisions purporting to repeal H.B. 2—are not severable.  \n374.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants Cooper, Stein, \nSpellings, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon in their official capacities for purposes of \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 2 both facially and as \napplied to them. \n375.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations \non state action that deprives individuals of life, liberty, or property.  \n376.  Substantive protections of the Due Process Clause include the right to avoid \ndisclosure of sensitive, personal information.  \n94 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 94 of 104\n\n377.  There is a fundamental right of privacy in preventing the release of, and in \ndeciding in what circumstances to release: (1) personal information of which the release \ncould subject them to bodily harm; and (2) information of a highly personal and intimate \nnature.  \n378.  H.B. 2 required the disclosure of highly personal information regarding \ntransgender people to each person who sees them using a restroom or other facility \ninconsistent with their gender identity or gender expression, and—if the repeal of H.B. 2 \nwere to be found inseverable from the other provisions of H.B. 142—would again do so. \nThis disclosure places them at risk of bodily harm.  \n379.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest. \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n380.  In addition, the privacy interests of transgender people that are invaded \noutweigh any purported interest the government could assert.  \nCOUNT V \n \nViolation of Liberty and Autonomy in the \nRight to Refuse Unwanted Medical Treatment \n(H.B. 2) \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon \n \n \n381.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 380 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n95 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 95 of 104\n\n382.  Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, Goss, and ACLU of NC re-plead this \nCount against Defendants Cooper, Spellings, Stein, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon solely \nin the event that this Court finds that (1) one or more provisions of H.B. 142 are \nunconstitutional or violate federal law and (2) the provision of H.B. 142 repealing H.B. 2 \nis not severable from H.B. 142’s unlawful provisions.  \n383.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants Cooper, Stein, \nSpellings, Sanders, Cohen, and Trogdon in their official capacities for purposes of \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 2 both facially and as \napplied to them. \n384.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals’ \nsubstantive rights to be free to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion. \n385.  The right to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion includes the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n386.  H.B. 2 forced transgender people to undergo medical procedures that may \nnot be medically appropriate or available in order to access facilities consistent with their \ngender identity and would again do so if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to be found \ninseverable from the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142. \n387.  Not all transgender individuals undergo gender confirmation surgery. For \nsome, the surgery is not medically necessary, while for others it is medically dangerous \nor impossible. For example, because medical treatment for gender dysphoria is \n96 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 96 of 104\n\nindividualized, hormone treatment may be sufficient to manage the distress associated \nwith gender dysphoria for some individuals. Surgery may be medically necessary for \nothers who do not have health insurance coverage for it and cannot afford to pay for the \nsurgery out-of-pocket.  \n388.  Some states require proof of surgery before they will allow the gender \nmarker on a birth certificate to be changed. For those born in North Carolina, state law \n(specifically N.C. Gen. Stat. § 130A-11B) requires proof of “sex reassignment surgery.”   \n389.  For example, Ms. Schafer was not able to amend her New Jersey birth \ncertificate to accurately reflect her gender because surgery has not been medically \nnecessary for her (indeed, such surgery is generally not available to individuals under \n18). Accordingly, H.B. 2 banned her from accessing restrooms and other facilities \nconsistent with her gender identity and would again do so if the repeal of H.B. 2 were to \nbe found inseverable from the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142.  \n390.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest. \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n97 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 97 of 104\n\nCOUNT VI \n \nViolation of Title IX \n(H.B. 142 and H.B. 2) \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Schafer, and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n391.

Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”   \n393.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination \non the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition. \n394.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \n395.  By failing to ensure that Mr. Carcaño—a transgender man—may use \nrestrooms and changing facilities consistent with his gender identity without fear of \npenalty, Defendant University of North Carolina excludes Mr. Carcaño from participation \nin, denies him the benefits of, and subjects him to discrimination in educational programs \nand activities at Defendant’s constituent campus, UNC-Chapel Hill, “on the basis of sex,” \n98 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 98 of 104\n\nwhich violates Mr. Carcaño’s rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n396.

Title VII provides that it is “an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer” to “discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, \nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex” or \nto “limit, segregate, or classify [its] employees or applicants for employment in any way \nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or \notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s . . . \nsex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).  \n401.  Under Title VII, discrimination “because of . . . sex” includes \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, \nand gender transition. \n100 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 100 of 104\n\n402.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an “employer” within the \nmeaning of Title VII. \n403.  Defendant University of North Carolina is engaged in sex discrimination \nagainst Mr. Carcaño in violation of Title VII. Defendant University of North Carolina has \nfailed to ensure Mr. Carcaño access to restrooms and changing facilities consistent with \nhis gender identity without fear of penalty, which is a term, condition, and privilege of \nemployment. This failure also limits, segregates, or classifies him in a way that deprives \nor tends to deprive him of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his \nstatus as an employee.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:   \nA.  Declaring that the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142 and/or H.B. 2 discussed \nabove (either independently or acting or operating in conjunction with any other “act of \nthe General Assembly”) and their enforcement by Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution;  \nB.  Declaring that the unlawful provisions of H.B. 142 and/or H.B. 2 discussed \nabove and their enforcement by Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ rights under Title IX and \nTitle VII; \nC.  Permanently enjoining enforcement by Defendants of the unlawful \nprovisions of H.B. 142 and/or H.B. 2 discussed above; \n101 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 101 of 104\n\nD.  Requiring Defendants in their official capacities to ensure the ability of \nindividuals, including transgender people, to use single-sex, multiple-user facilities in \naccordance with their gender identity without fear of arrest or other penalty in all public \nschools and universities, executive branch agencies, and public agencies;1 and requiring \nDefendants in their official capacities to allow local governments to enact and to continue \nto enforce anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people; \nE.  Awarding Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, and Schafer nominal damages in \nthe amount of $1.00 for violation of their rights under Title IX and Title VII, as \napplicable; \nF.  Awarding Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), and other applicable laws; and \nG.  Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nH.  The declaratory and injunctive relief requested in this action is sought \nagainst each Defendant; against each Defendant’s officers, employees, and agents; and \nagainst all persons acting in active concert or participation with any Defendant, or under \nany Defendant’s supervision, direction, or control.   \n                                                           \n1 In order to avoid any doubt, Plaintiffs explicitly clarify that they do not challenge and \nhave never challenged in this case the practice of having single-sex, multiple-user \nrestrooms, showers, or dressing areas in public buildings in North Carolina, and that they \ndo not seek and have never sought relief in this case ending that practice. What they seek \nis an end to restrictions on the ability of transgender people to use such single-sex, \nmultiple-user facilities in accordance with their gender identity, like all other individuals \nare able to do. \n102 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 210   Filed 09/07/17   Page 102 of 104\n\nDated:  September 7, 2017 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Christopher A.

LOUIS BISSETTE, JR., in his official \ncapacity as Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the University of North Carolina, \n       \nDefendants.   \n \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1. This lawsuit challenges a sweeping North Carolina law, House Bill 2 \n(“H.B. 2”), which bans transgender people from accessing restrooms and other facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity and blocks local governments from protecting \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) people against discrimination in a wide \nvariety of settings.  By singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly \n1 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 1 of 45\n\nwriting discrimination against transgender people into state law, H.B. 2 violates the most \nbasic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution. \n \n2. In February 2016, the City of Charlotte enacted an ordinance (the \n“Ordinance”) that extended existing municipal anti-discrimination protections to LGBT \npeople.  In light of the pervasive discrimination faced by LGBT people—and particularly \ntransgender people—advocates had long pressed the Charlotte City Council for these \nprotections.  Because North Carolina state law does not expressly prohibit discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity, many LGBT residents of Charlotte—as \nwell as LGBT residents throughout the state—are exposed to invidious discrimination in \ntheir day-to-day lives simply for being themselves.  After two hours-long hearings, in \nwhich there was extensive public comment on both sides of the issue, the Charlotte City \nCouncil voted to adopt the Ordinance.   \n \n3. Before the Ordinance could take effect, the North Carolina General \nAssembly rushed to convene a special session with the express purpose of passing a \nstatewide law that would preempt Charlotte’s “radical” move to protect its residents from \ndiscrimination.  In a process rife with procedural irregularities, the legislature introduced \nand passed H.B. 2 in a matter of hours, and the governor signed the bill into law that \nsame day.  Lawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality, \ninstead openly and virulently attacking transgender people, who were falsely portrayed as \npredatory and dangerous to others.  While the discriminatory, stated focus of the \nlegislature in passing H.B. 2—the use of restrooms by transgender people—is on its own \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 2 of 45\n\nillegal and unconstitutional, H.B. 2 in facts wreaks far greater damage by also prohibiting \nlocal governments in North Carolina from enacting express anti-discrimination \nprotections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n \n4. Plaintiffs are individuals and nonprofit organizations whose members and \nconstituents will be directly impacted by H.B. 2.  Like the two transgender plaintiffs in \nthe case, transgender people around the state of North Carolina immediately suffered \nharm under H.B. 2 in that they are not able to access public restrooms and other single-\nsex facilities that accord with their gender identity.  LGBT people are also harmed by \nH.B. 2 in that it strips them of or bars them from anti-discrimination protections under \nlocal law.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that H.B. 2 violates their or their \nmembers’ constitutional and statutory rights to equal protection, liberty, dignity, \nautonomy and privacy, as well an injunction preliminarily and permanently enjoining \nenforcement by of H.B. 2 by Defendants. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs. \n \n5. Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño (“Mr. Carcaño”) is a 27-year-old man who \nresides in Carrboro, North Carolina.  Mr. Carcaño is employed by the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill (“UNC-Chapel Hill”).  He is transgender. \n \n6. Plaintiff Payton Grey McGarry (“Mr. McGarry”) is a 20-year-old man who \nresides in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Mr. McGarry is a full-time student at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Greensboro (“UNC-Greensboro”).  He is transgender. \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 3 of 45\n\n \n7. Plaintiff Angela Gilmore (“Ms. Gilmore”) is a 52-year-old woman who \nresides in Durham, North Carolina and is an Associate Dean and Professor at North \nCarolina Central University School of Law.  Ms. Gilmore is a lesbian.    \n \n8. Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina (“ACLU of \nNC”) is a private, non-profit membership organization with its principal office in \nRaleigh, North Carolina.  It has approximately 8,500 members in the State of North \nCarolina, including LGBT members.  The mission of the ACLU of NC is to defend and \nadvance the individual freedoms embodied in the United States Constitution, including \nthe rights of LGBT people, to be free from invidious discrimination and infringements on \ntheir liberty interests.  The ACLU of NC sues on behalf of its members, some of whom \nare transgender individuals who are barred by H.B. 2 from using restrooms and other \nfacilities in accordance with their gender identity in schools and government buildings, \nand some of whom are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender individuals who have been \nstripped of or barred from local non-discrimination protections based on their sexual \norientation and sex, including gender identity.  \n9.  Plaintiff Equality NC (“Equality NC”) is North Carolina’s largest non-\nprofit organization advocating for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \nindividuals, with over 100,000 constituents and supporters.  Originally founded in 1979 \nas the North Carolina Human Rights Fund, Equality NC is dedicated to securing equal \nrights and justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender North Carolinians.  Equality \nNC conducts comprehensive campaigns to build public support for equal rights, \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 4 of 45\n\nadvocates with policy-making bodies for the enactment of anti-discrimination protections \nfor LGBT people, and provides educational programming on LGBT issues.  Equality NC \nrepresents the interests of constituents who would otherwise have standing to participate \nin this case and have indicia of membership.  Because Equality NC’s primary function is \nto protect the rights of LGBT people, its challenge to H.B. 2 is germane to the \norganization’s purpose. \nB.  Defendants. \n \n10. Defendant Patrick McCrory (“Defendant McCrory” or “Governor \nMcCrory” or “the Governor”) is sued in his official capacity as the Governor of North \nCarolina.  Pursuant to Article III, Section 1 of the State Constitution, “the executive \npower of the State” is vested in Defendant McCrory in his capacity as Governor.  Article \nIII, Section 5(4) also provides that it is the duty of Defendant McCrory in his capacity as \nGovernor to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”  Governor McCrory is a \nperson within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and was acting under color of state law at \nall times relevant to this complaint. \n \n11. Defendant Roy Cooper III (“Defendant Cooper” or “Mr. Cooper”) is sued \nin his official capacity as the Attorney General of North Carolina.  Pursuant to N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 114-2, it is Defendant Cooper’s duty in his capacity as Attorney General of North \nCarolina to appear on behalf of the state in any court or tribunal in any cause or matter, \ncivil or criminal, in which the state may be a party or interested.  It is also the duty of \nDefendant Cooper to defend and enforce the laws of North Carolina.  Mr. Cooper is a \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 5 of 45\n\nperson within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and was acting under color of state law at \nall times relevant to this complaint. \n12.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance.  Defendant University of North Carolina includes \nits constituent institutions, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Greensboro. \n \n13. Defendant Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina (“the \nBoard”) is a corporate body charged with the general control, supervision, and \ngovernance of the University of North Carolina’s constituent institutions.  The Board is \ncapable of being sued in “all courts whatsoever” pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 116-3. \n \n14. Defendant W. Louis Bissette, Jr. (“Defendant Bissette” or “Mr. Bissette”) is \nsued in his official capacity as the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the University \nof North Carolina and has the power to ensure the Board’s compliance with any \ninjunctive relief.   \n \n15. Defendants, through their respective duties and obligations, are responsible \nfor enforcing H.B. 2.  Each Defendant, and those subject to their direction, supervision, \nand control, has or intentionally will perform, participate in, aide and/or abet in some \nmanner the acts alleged in this complaint, has or will proximately cause the harm alleged \nherein, and has or will continue to injure Plaintiffs irreparably if not enjoined.  \nAccordingly, the relief requested herein is sought against each Defendant, as well as all \n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 6 of 45\n\npersons under their supervision, direction, or control, including but not limited to their \nofficers, employees, and agents. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n16. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution and under Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”). \n \n17. This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under \nlaws of the United States and the United States Constitution. \n \n18. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) because \nDefendant University of North Carolina resides within the District, and all Defendants \nreside within the State of North Carolina; and because a substantial part of the events that \ngave rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims took place within the District. \n \n19. This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n \n20. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are \ndomiciled in North Carolina. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nA.  Plaintiffs. \n \n21.  Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño works for UNC-Chapel Hill’s Institute for \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 7 of 45\n\nGlobal Health and Infectious Disease as a Project Coordinator.  The project that he \ncoordinates provides medical education and services such as HIV testing to the Latino/a \npopulation.   \n \n22. Mr. Carcaño is a man.  \n \n23. Until the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. Carcaño was recognized and treated like \nall other men at his work at UNC-Chapel Hill.  \n \n24. Mr. Carcaño is transgender.  What that means is that his sex assigned at \nbirth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately \nreflect his gender identity, which is male.  \n \n25. A person’s gender identity refers to the person’s internal sense of belonging \nto a particular gender.  There is a medical consensus that gender identity is innate and \nthat efforts to change a person’s gender identity are unethical and harmful to a person’s \nhealth and well-being. \n \n26. The gender marker on a birth certificate is designated at the time of birth \ngenerally based upon the appearance of external genitalia.  However, determinations of \nsex can involve multiple factors, such as chromosomes, hormone levels, internal and \nexternal reproductive organs, and gender identity.   \n \n27. Gender identity is the primary determinant of sex. \n \n28. Mr. Carcaño was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical diagnosis \nfor the clinically significant distress that individuals whose gender identity differs from \nthe sex they were assigned at birth can experience. \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 8 of 45\n\n \n29. Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that if left untreated can \nlead to clinical distress, debilitating depression, and even suicidal thoughts and acts.   \n \n30. Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized in the American Psychiatric \nAssociation's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth ed. (2013) \n(DSM-V), and by the other leading medical and mental health professional groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association and the American Psychological \nAssociation. \n \n31. Medical treatment for gender dysphoria must be individualized for the \nmedical needs of each patient.  \n \n32. Treatment for gender dysphoria includes living one’s life consistent with \none’s gender identity, including when accessing single-sex spaces like restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  \n \n33. Forcing a transgender person to use single-sex spaces that do not match the \nperson’s gender identity is inconsistent with medical protocols and can cause anxiety and \ndistress to the transgender person and result in harassment of and violence against them.  \n \n34. Mr. Carcaño was born and raised in South Texas.  Since a very young age, \naround 7 or 8 years old, Mr. Carcaño was aware that he did not feel like a girl, but he did \nnot know how to express how he felt. \n \n35. Mr. Carcaño ultimately acknowledged his male gender identity to himself \nlater in his adult life. \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 9 of 45\n\n \n36. Mr. Carcaño has been in the continuous care of a licensed mental health \nclinician since 2013, who diagnosed Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria.  Mr. Carcaño \ninitially sought treatment for depression, which was caused in part by his gender \ndysphoria. \n \n37. Mental health and medical professionals worldwide recognize and follow \nthe evidence-based standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria developed by \nthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”).  After \ndiagnosing Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria, his therapist developed a course of \ntreatment consistent with those standards.  The goal of such treatment is to alleviate \ndistress by helping a person live congruently with the person’s gender identity, the \nprimary determinant of sex.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in January \n2015, Mr. Carcaño explained to his family and friends that he was a man. \n \n38. A critical component of the WPATH Standards of Care is a social transition \nto living full-time consistently with the individual’s gender identity.  For Mr. Carcaño, \nthat includes living in accordance with his gender identity in all respects, including the \nuse of a male name and pronouns and use of the men’s restrooms. \n \n39. For transgender adults, it is critical that social transition include transition \nin the workplace, including with respect to restrooms.  Excluding a transgender man from \nthe restroom that corresponds to his gender identity, or forcing him to use a separate \nfacility from other men, communicates to the entire workplace that he should not be \nrecognized as a man and undermines the social transition process. \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 10 of 45\n\n \n40. Mr. Carcaño also began using Joaquín as his first name in January 2015.  \nHis friends, family, and coworkers now recognize him as a man, and they refer to him \nusing his male name and male pronouns. \n \n41. Also consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño’s \nphysician recommended and prescribed hormone treatment, which Mr. Carcaño has \nreceived since May 2015.  For both hormone therapy and surgical treatment, the WPATH \nStandards of Care require persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria, which is a \ncriterion that Mr. Carcaño satisfied.  Among other therapeutic benefits, the hormone \ntreatment has deepened Mr. Carcaño’s voice, increased his growth of facial hair, and \ngiven him a more masculine appearance.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress Mr. \nCarcaño experienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his \nidentity and helped him to feel more comfortable with who he is.  \n \n42. As part of the treatment for his gender dysphoria, Mr. Carcaño also \nobtained a bilateral mastectomy in January 2016.  Consistent with WPATH Standards of \nCare, Mr. Carcaño satisfied the requirement of having a referral from a qualified mental \nhealth professional in order to obtain the surgical treatment. \n \n43. As part of his social transition, Mr. Carcaño began using the men’s \nrestroom at work and elsewhere in late 2015, which occurred without incident for the five \nmonths or so before H.B. 2’s enactment.  Mr. Carcaño’s therapist had also specifically \nrecommended that he use only the men’s restroom.  She was concerned that using the \nwomen’s restroom could compromise his mental health, well-being, and safety.  By late \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 11 of 45\n\n2015, Mr. Carcaño had facial hair facilitated by hormone treatment, and his therapist \nindicated that others would recognize Mr. Carcaño as male based on his physical \nappearance. \n \n44. Mr. Carcaño is now comfortable with the status of his treatment and, with \nthe exception of the distress now caused by the passage of H.B. 2, his distress has been \nmanaged through the clinically recommended treatment he has received.  He plans to \ncontinue treatment under the supervision of medical professionals and based on his \nmedical needs.  \n \n45. Apart from the building where he works, Mr. Carcaño also used other \nmen’s restrooms on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus without incident for approximately \nfive months prior to H.B. 2’s passage.  In addition, when out in public, such as at \nrestaurants and stores, Mr. Carcaño uses the men’s restroom. \n \n46. The only restrooms on the floor where Mr. Carcaño works at UNC-Chapel \nHill are designated either for men or for women.  There are no restrooms in the building \nwhere Mr. Carcaño works that are not designated either for men or women.  All the \nrestrooms in the building are multiple occupancy. \n \n47. If Mr. Carcaño could not use the men’s restroom at UNC-Chapel Hill, he \nwould have to leave campus and find a local business in order to use the men’s restroom; \nor he would have to locate a restroom not designated for either men or women elsewhere \non campus.  Either way, preventing him from using the multiple occupancy restrooms \nthat other men are able to use is stigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 12 of 45\n\nother men.  It also interferes with his ability to perform his job duties by requiring him to \nleave his building each time he needs to use the restroom throughout the workday. \n \n48. Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. Carcaño, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. Carcaño to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment.  \n \n49. The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. Carcaño to \nexperience significant anxiety as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n \n50. Mr. Carcaño also visits public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, as part of his job \nat UNC-Chapel Hill, Mr. Carcaño has had to visit the offices North Carolina Department \nof Health and Human Services many times in the past, and he will continue to need to do \nso in the future.  Prior to passage of H.B. 2, he used the men’s restroom while at their \noffice, but he will be banned from doing so in the future under H.B. 2. \n \n51. Similarly, Mr. Carcaño has visited state courthouses in Chapel Hill as part \nof a process to obtain a name change from his current legal name, which includes a \ntraditionally female first name, to the name he currently uses.  Because that name change \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 13 of 45\n\nprocess is ongoing, Mr. Carcaño will continue to visit state courthouses in the future, but \nhe will be banned from using the men’s restroom there under H.B. 2. \n \n52. Mr. Carcaño has also visited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future, where he will be banned from using \nthe men’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n \n53. Mr. Carcaño also regularly uses the North Carolina Rest Area System, \nwhich maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation.  For example, he uses the restrooms provided by that \nsystem when he travels approximately once a month to visit his brother in Atlanta, and \nwhen he visits Washington, D.C. periodically.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B.2. \n \n54. There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. Carcaño’s knowledge, \ncomplaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n \n55. Mr. Carcaño is a member of the ACLU of NC.   \n56.  Plaintiff Payton Grey McGarry is a full-time student at the University of \nNorth Carolina at Greensboro (“UNC-Greensboro”) where he is double majoring in \nBusiness Administration and Accounting.  He is also a skilled musician and has played \ntrumpet in many ensembles at UNC-Greensboro.  He plays the guitar, baritone, clarinet, \nand saxophone. \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 14 of 45\n\n \n57. Mr. McGarry is close to his family and has a younger brother who is also a \nmember of the LGBT community.  Mr. McGarry hopes to use his education to eventually \ngo to law school and work to defend people’s civil rights. \n \n58. Mr. McGarry is a man.  \n \n59. Mr. McGarry is transgender.  As is true for Mr. Carcaño, Mr. McGarry’s \nsex assigned at birth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does \nnot conform to his gender identity, which is male.   \n \n60. Mr. McGarry was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n \n61. Mr. McGarry was born and raised in Wilson, North Carolina.  Throughout \nhis childhood, Mr. McGarry felt like a boy and never really thought of himself as a girl.  \nIt was not until he started to go through puberty that he began to wrestle with the \ndisconnect between his identity as a boy and his assigned birth sex.  \n \n62. Mr. McGarry realized while he was in high school that he is transgender. \n \n63. In October of 2013, during his senior year in high school, Mr. McGarry \nbegan mental health treatment with a licensed clinical social worker who diagnosed him \nwith gender dysphoria.  \n \n64. After diagnosing Mr. McGarry with gender dysphoria, his therapist \ndeveloped a course of treatment in accordance with medical standards for treating the \ncondition.   \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 15 of 45\n\n \n65. Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in the fall and winter of \n2013, Mr. McGarry explained to his friends and family that he is male and began to use \nmale pronouns.  \n \n66. In April of 2014, under the care of an endocrinologist, Mr. McGarry began \nhormone therapy.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress Mr. McGarry experienced \ndue to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his identity and helped him to \nfeel more comfortable with who he is. \n \n67. By the time he graduated high school in June of 2014, Mr. McGarry used \nthe name Payton and male pronouns in all aspects of his life.  He is known as Payton \nMcGarry to his family, friends, and peers, although he has not yet changed his legal first \nname to Payton. \n \n68.  In the fall of 2014, Mr. McGarry enrolled as a freshman at UNC-\nGreensboro as Payton McGarry and as male. \n \n69. Since arriving at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. McGarry has identified and has \nbeen known to others as male for all purposes. \n \n70. Mr. McGarry is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity, \nand is the Vice President of the Iota Epsilon Chapter of that fraternity.  His fraternity \nbrothers are aware that he is transgender and have no concerns with his use of men’s \nrestrooms and locker rooms. \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 16 of 45\n\n \n71. Though Mr. McGarry currently lives off campus, he is on campus six or \nseven days per week and always uses the restroom designed for men in on-campus \nbuildings. \n \n72. Mr. McGarry regularly uses the locker room facilities at UNC-Greensboro \nand always uses the facilities designed for men.  \n \n73. For the past year and a half since he enrolled at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. \nMcGarry has used the men’s restrooms and locker rooms on-campus without incident.  \nMr. McGarry is unaware of any instance in which any person has complained about his \nuse of the men’s restroom or locker room.  \n \n74. Mr. McGarry works part-time as a visual technician for marching bands at \ndifferent high schools around the state and regularly uses the bathroom for men when \nworking as a visual technician.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. \nMcGarry’s knowledge, complaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n \n75. In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, Mr. \nMcGarry always uses the men’s restroom. \n \n76. To Mr. McGarry’s knowledge, there are very few single-user restrooms on \nthe UNC-Greensboro campus and in many buildings where he has classes there are no \nsingle user bathrooms. \n \n77. If Mr. McGarry could not use the men’s restroom at UNC-Greensboro, he \nwould have to search for single-user restrooms outside of the buildings where his classes \nare held every time he had to use the restroom.  This would disrupt his ability to attend \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 17 of 45\n\nclass and would interfere with his educational opportunities.  Expelling him from the \nmultiple occupancy restrooms and locker rooms available to all other male students is \nstigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than other men. \n \n78. Since he started testosterone two years ago, Mr. McGarry’s voice has \ndeepened and his face and body have become more traditionally masculine in \nappearance. \n \n79. Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. McGarry, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. McGarry to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment. \n \n80. The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. McGarry to \nexperience significant anxiety as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n \n81. Mr. McGarry has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, Mr. McGarry has \nvisited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s license) and anticipates doing \nso again in the future, where he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under H.B. \n2. \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 18 of 45\n\n \n82. Mr. McGarry also has used and will continue to use the North Carolina \nRest Area System, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by \nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under H.B. \n2. \n83.  Plaintiff Angela Gilmore is a resident of Durham, North Carolina.  \nMs. Gilmore has lived in North Carolina since 2011, when she moved from Florida to \ntake a job at North Carolina Central University.  She is currently the Associate Dean for \nAcademic Affairs and Professor of Law at North Carolina Central University.   \n \n84. Ms. Gilmore is a lesbian, and has been in a relationship with her wife, \nAngela Wallace, for almost twenty years.  Ms. Gilmore and Ms. Wallace were married in \nWashington, D.C. in 2014.  \n \n85. Ms. Gilmore looked for and accepted a job in North Carolina, after she and \nher wife fell in love with the state during a visiting teaching job Ms. Gilmore had at Elon \nUniversity School of Law in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2010.   \n \n86. Both Ms. Gilmore and her wife, African American lesbians, felt that North \nCarolina, and Durham in particular, was a place where they could be fully themselves, \ncomfortable in terms of both their race and sexual orientation.   \n \n87. Ms. Gilmore and her wife love living in Durham—they feel very much part \nof the community—and prior to the passage of H.B. 2, they had been looking at small \ntowns in North Carolina where they might want to retire. \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 19 of 45\n\n \n88. Since moving to North Carolina, Ms. Gilmore has worked towards \nincreasing non-discrimination protections for LGBT people.  Ms. Gilmore is a member of \nACLU of NC, and she was on the ACLU of NC board between 2014 and 2015.  During \nthat time, the ACLU of NC actively worked to defeat anti-LGBT bills proposed in the \nstate legislature and to pass local ordinances, like the Ordinance, and to protect LGBT \npeople from discrimination at the local level.  Ms. Gilmore also has spoken on panels at \nher law school and other law schools regarding non-discrimination protections for LGBT \npeople. \n \n89. The passage of H.B. 2 has caused Ms. Gilmore and her wife distress, in that \nit has significantly undone their sense of belonging and value in the state, which is why \nthey moved to North Carolina.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife experience H.B. 2 as sending a \nclear message to them as lesbians that they are not welcome in North Carolina. \n \n90. Ms. Gilmore and her wife have visited the city of Charlotte and they plan to \ndo so in the future.  As two women traveling together with the same first name, they are \noften asked about the nature of their relationship, and they therefore regularly reveal \nthemselves to be a lesbian couple.  Under the Ordinance, Ms. Gilmore and her wife \nwould have been protected from sexual orientation discrimination in public \naccommodations in the city of Charlotte.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore \nworries that she and her wife will now be exposed to discrimination based on their sexual \norientation. \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 20 of 45\n\n \n91. With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore also is limited in her ability to \nincrease and benefit from non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in North \nCarolina.  Were she able to, Ms. Gilmore would continue to advocate for local ordinances \nthat prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n \n92. As a non-transgender woman who always uses the facilities designated for \nwomen in both public and private spaces, the passage of H.B. 2 does not make Ms. \nGilmore feel safer in these facilities.    \nB.  The City of Charlotte’s Enactment of a Non-Discrimination \nOrdinance. \n \n \n93. Advocates have long worked for the passage of an ordinance that would \nensure that LGBT people were expressly protected from discrimination within the City of \nCharlotte.  Prior to the vote on the Ordinance, there had been an earlier round of intensive \npublic engagement in late 2014 to early 2015, when the Charlotte City Council \npreviously considered expanding non-discrimination protections to include sexual \norientation and gender identity and expression. \n \n94. There was again extensive discussion and deliberation leading up to the \nFebruary 2016 vote on the Ordinance.  The Charlotte City Council heard hours of robust \npublic comment in a forum that included hundreds of people—both those who were in \nsupport of the Ordinance and those who were in opposition to the Ordinance.  The \nCharlotte City Council also received significant legal analysis from the Office of the City \nAttorney regarding its authority to enact the Ordinance and the effect of the Ordinance.  \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 21 of 45\n\n \n95. The impetus for the Ordinance is the reality that LGBT people often face \npervasive discrimination.  Although same-sex couples may now marry throughout the \nUnited States as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell, lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual people remain vulnerable to discrimination in states like North \nCarolina, where there is no express protection for sexual orientation in state law, making \nlocal anti-discrimination protections even more vital.  Discrimination is especially \npervasive for transgender people, as evidenced by a 2011 national study of transgender \nAmericans, Injustice at Every Turn, which documented the high levels of harassment, \ndiscrimination, and violence that transgender people have faced and continue to face. \n \n96. In the 2011 national report cited above, 90% of respondents reported being \nharassed at work or taking actions to avoid harassment while 26% reported being fired \nbecause they are transgender.  Forty-seven percent reported some form of employment \ndiscrimination because they are transgender, including not being hired, not being \npromoted, or being fired.  Fifty-three percent reported being verbally harassed or \ndisrespected in a place of public accommodation, and 22% report being denied equal \ntreatment by a government agency or official, because they are transgender. \n \n97. In 2013, it was estimated that there were more than 250,000 LGBT adults \nin North Carolina, out of an adult population of approximately eight million people.  In \naddition, there are an estimated 37,800 transgender people (of any age) in North Carolina, \nincluding 15,600 individuals who are 13 to 19 years old.  While transgender individuals \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 22 of 45\n\nonly make up a small minority of the population, they are disproportionately targeted for \nhate crimes in the United States. \n \n98. On Monday, February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council approved by a \n7-to-4 vote the Ordinance, which, inter alia, amended its existing public accommodations \nprotections by barring discrimination in public accommodations based on “gender \nidentity, gender expression” and “sexual orientation.” \n \n99. The City Council’s vote was met with a firestorm of opposition from vocal \nopponents of the part of the Ordinance that would have required certain public \naccommodations to allow transgender people to use single-sex facilities, such as \nrestrooms and locker rooms, in accordance with their gender identity. \n \n100. Opponents of the Ordinance distorted the truth of what the Ordinance’s \nnon-discrimination requirement would accomplish and formed a vocal campaign \ndecrying a purported attempt to permit “men in women’s restrooms.” \nC.  The Events Leading to H.B. 2, Contemporary Statements by \nDecisionmakers, and Departures From the Normal Legislative Process \nRevealed a Series of Official Actions Taken for Invidious Purposes.   \n \n \n101. The State of North Carolina has rarely, if ever, exercised authority to \npreempt local ordinances providing broader protections than under state law.  For \nexample, in 1968 Charlotte adopted an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in public \naccommodations on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.  In 1972, the \nCouncil amended the ordinance to prohibit discrimination based on sex, which the \nCouncil further modified in 1985. \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 23 of 45\n\n \n102. Even though all of these protections extended beyond the reach of the \nState’s public accommodations law, which until H.B. 2 prohibited only public \naccommodations discrimination based on disability, the State allowed Charlotte’s \nordinance to stand undisturbed for decades.  It was only after Charlotte took steps to \nprotect LGBT people that the State rushed to preempt the ordinance. \n \n103. Even before the Charlotte City Council had cast its vote on the Ordinance, \nGovernor McCrory informed Charlotte City Council members that the State would likely \ntake immediate action to put a halt to the Ordinance—even as Governor McCrory \nconceded that was an exceedingly unusual step.  In an email to Charlotte City Council \nmembers, Governor McCrory noted that he “made a point as the former 14 year Mayor \nand current Governor to stay out of specific issues being voted on by the Charlotte City \nCouncil.”  Governor McCrory nonetheless characterized the Ordinance’s non-\ndiscrimination protections for LGBT people as “changing basic long-established values \nand norms” surrounding “public restrooms,” and ominously warning of “possible danger \nfrom deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  \nGovernor McCrory said that the Ordinance would “most likely cause immediate State \nlegislative intervention which I would support as governor.”    \n \n104. On Tuesday, February 23, 2016, the Speaker of the House, Tim Moore, \nissued a press release announcing that he would work with fellow Republicans to explore \na “legislative intervention to correct [Charlotte’s] radical course.” \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 24 of 45\n\n \n105. In North Carolina, it is the state’s Governor who typically calls a special \nsession, but in this case, Governor McCrory refused to call a special session because he \nwas concerned the legislature would go beyond addressing the Charlotte Ordinance. \n \n106. As a result of the Governor’s refusal to call a special session, legislative \nleaders opted for a rarely used law that allows special sessions when three-fifths of \nlegislators in both chambers support the call.  That provision in the state constitution had \nnot been used since 1981, according to Lt. Governor Dan Forest’s chief of staff, Hal \nWeatherman.  The special session cost approximately $42,000 to convene.   \n \n107. The text of H.B. 2, which was named the “Public Facilities Privacy and \nSecurity Act,” was not shared with most legislators until they arrived to debate the bill. \n \n108. North Carolina House of Representatives Minority Leader Larry Hall \n(“Minority Leader Hall”) stated “We don’t know what we’re discussing here, we don’t \nknow what we’re voting on.  What we’re doing is a perversion of the process.” \n \n109. Minority Leader Hall said that Democrats were initially told that the special \nsession would take place Thursday, March 24, 2016, when instead the special session was \nheld on March 23, 2016.  Minority Leader Hall stated that, as a result, a number of \nlegislators were “caught off guard” and were “scrambling to try to come back” for the \nsession. \n \n110. Comments made by lawmakers both during the debate, in the press, and \nthrough their social media used vitriolic language to make clear their aim at undoing \nCharlotte’s protections for LGBT people: \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 25 of 45\n\n \na. Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger’s descriptions of the \nlegislature’s work included:   \n \ni. “Senate unanimously votes to stop radical ordinance allowing \nmen into public bathrooms with women and young girls.” \n \nii. “Lawmakers were forced to come back to session to address \nthe serious safety concerns created by the dangerous ordinance – which violated existing \nstate criminal trespass law, indecent exposure law and building codes and created a \nloophole that any man with nefarious motives could use to prey on women and young \nchildren . . .” \n \niii. “How many fathers are now going to be forced to go to the \nladies’ room to make sure their little girls aren’t molested?” \n \nb. North Carolina state Senator Buck Newton said, “The Charlotte City \nCouncil should have never passed this unlawful and reckless bathroom and locker room \nordinance.  Politics have reached a new extreme when a municipality’s top priority is \nallowing men into women’s bathrooms and locker rooms.  But tens of thousands of our \nconstituents from across the state have called on us to stand up to the political correctness \nmob, fight for common sense and put a stop to this nonsense once and for all.” \n \nc. North Carolina state Senator David Curtis (“Senator Curtis”) said, \n“This liberal group is trying to redefine everything about our society.  Gender and \nmarriage — just the whole liberal agenda.”  Senator Curtis added that while, “We \ngenerally don’t get involved in local politics.  We need to do what’s right.”  Senator \n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 26 of 45\n\nCurtis said that H.B. 2 was necessary because, “The gays would go into a business, make \nsome outrageous demand that they know the owner cannot comply with and file a lawsuit \nagainst that business owner and put him out of business.” \n \nd. North Carolina state Senator David Brock said, “You know, $42,000 \nis not going to cover the medical expenses when a pervert walks into a bathroom and my \nlittle girls are in there.”  \n \n111. Debate in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly focused \nspecifically on reversing the Charlotte Ordinance, with lawmakers in both chambers \ncondemning the anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people, including transgender \nindividuals’ right to use facilities in accordance with their gender identity.   \n \n112. Less than 10 hours after it was introduced, the bill unanimously passed both \nhouses.  Governor McCrory signed the bill that same night, issuing a signing statement \nmaking clear once again the targets of H.B. 2.  His signing statement said, “This radical \nbreach of trust and security under the false argument of equal access not only impacts the \ncitizens of Charlotte but people who come to Charlotte to work, visit or play.  This new \ngovernment regulation defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, \nfor example, a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.”  H.B. 2 took \neffect immediately.   \nD.  H.B. 2 Harms Transgender People. \n \n113. H.B. 2 amended North Carolina’s General Statutes to mandate that school \nboards require students to use restrooms and other single-sex facilities in accordance with \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 27 of 45\n\ntheir “biological sex” providing that,  \nLocal boards of education shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used \nonly by students based on their biological sex. \n \n \n114. H.B. 2 also imposes the same mandate on all executive branch agencies \n(which are expressly defined to include Defendant University of North Carolina), and all \npublic agencies, providing that they, \nshall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be \ndesignated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex.   \n \n \n115. Each of those provisions defines “biological sex” as follows, \n \nBiological sex. – The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated \non a person’s birth certificate.  \n \n \n116. Changing the gender marker on one’s birth certificate is not a viable option \nfor many transgender people, as every jurisdiction has a different set of often onerous and \nunnecessary requirements for updating the gender listed on a birth certificate. \n \n117. For instance, a person born in North Carolina can only update the gender \nmarker listed on a North Carolina-issued birth certificate with proof of certain surgeries \nthat may not be medically necessary, advisable, or affordable for any given person.  Even \nmore troubling, a person born in neighboring Tennessee can never change the gender \nlisted on a Tennessee-issued birth certificate. \n \n118. Medical treatment such as the surgery required to update a person’s North \nCarolina birth certificate does not alter a person’s gender (or what H.B. 2 calls \n“biological sex”), but rather merely brings a person’s body into alignment with the \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 28 of 45\n\ngender they have always been.  Gender identity is instead the chief determinant of a \nperson’s gender.  \n \n119. H.B. 2’s provisions requiring use of single-sex facilities in accordance with \nthe sex stated on their birth certificate not only disproportionately burdens transgender \npeople, but intentionally targets them for differential treatment.  Lawmakers made clear \nthat H.B. 2 was specifically aimed at transgender people.  For example, an FAQ released \nby Governor McCrory after H.B. 2’s enactment states, “Why did North Carolina pass this \nlaw in the first place?  Answer:  The bill was passed after the Charlotte City Council \nvoted to impose a regulation requiring businesses to allow a man into a women’s \nrestroom, shower, or locker room if they choose,” even though it does not do that, but \nonly allows a transgender woman to use a women’s restroom or other multiple user \nfacility for women.  \n \n120. Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, it was already illegal for a person to enter a \nrestroom or locker room to assault or injure another.  Moreover, protecting transgender \npeople from discrimination in public accommodations, as has been done in numerous \nstates and hundreds of localities, has resulted in no increase in public safety incidents in \nany jurisdiction anywhere in the United States, and including transgender people in \npublic life in no way impacts the safety or well-being of non-transgender people. \n \n121. The painful message of stigma sent by H.B. 2 echoes the dehumanizing \nrhetoric employed by a number of lawmakers, suggesting that transgender people are \nsomehow predatory or dangerous to others.  In fact, it is H.B. 2 that exposes transgender \n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 29 of 45\n\npeople to harassment and potential violence.  Transgender people are already \ndisproportionately targeted for physical violence and harassment in North Carolina and \nacross the country.  When a transgender person is forced to disclose their transgender \nstatus to strangers, such disclosure puts them at a high risk for violence.  H.B. 2’s \nrequirement that transgender people be shunted into single-sex spaces that do not match \ntheir gender identity invades their privacy and exposes this vulnerable population to \nharassment and potential violence by others. \n \n122. Upon information and belief, after the enactment of H.B. 2, some school \nofficials that had been respecting their students’ gender identity without any problem \ncalled parents to say that their children would be forced out of the single-sex facilities \nthat match their gender identity.   \n \n123. H.B. 2’s broad sweep means that the same result applies to executive and \npublic agencies, including routine places such as libraries, public health centers, airports, \nand the Division of Motor Vehicles, as well as places where people may turn in times of \ncrisis, such as state hospitals, police departments, and courthouses.  Transgender \nindividuals working in such agencies may not be able to safely use any bathroom any \nlonger, threatening their ability to keep their job. \n \n124. H.B. 2’s restroom ban also deters transgender people from participating in \nthe state and local democratic process.  It bans them from using the restroom consistent \nwith their gender identity when visiting the North Carolina General Assembly, \npetitioning their legislator, or entering any building operated by the legislative branch.  It \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 30 of 45\n\nalso bans them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity at a city \ncouncil meeting or at a mayor’s office. \n \n125. H.B. 2’s harms extend even farther, creating conflicts between state law \nand various federal laws.  The conflict with Title IX, for example, puts at risk the more \nthan $4.5 billion in federal education funding that North Carolina is expected to receive \nin 2016.  Employers subject to Title VII also will violate the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission’s decree that discriminating against transgender people with \nrespect to restroom use is impermissible sex discrimination.  Public hospitals that receive \nfederal funding also will violate Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act if they comply \nwith H.B. 2.   \n \n126. All of this follows a history of discrimination by the decisionmakers against \ntransgender people, including for example, Governor McCrory’s participation in a Fourth \nCircuit amicus curiae brief arguing that a transgender student’s request to access \nrestrooms in accordance with his gender identity is “radical.”   \nE.  H.B. 2 Harms Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals, as well as \nTransgender Individuals. \n \n \n127. H.B. 2 also disproportionately burdens lesbian, gay, and bisexual \nindividuals, as well as transgender individuals, by stripping them of or barring them from \nanti-discrimination projections under local law.  H.B. 2 took aim at the Charlotte \nordinance in a section providing,    \nThe General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in \nemployment is properly an issue of general, statewide concern, such that this \nArticle and other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 31 of 45\n\npreempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a \nunit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or \nimposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of \ndiscriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to \npersonnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law. \n \n \n128.  H.B. 2 stripped lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals of anti-\ndiscrimination protections in Charlotte, because no such sexual orientation anti-\ndiscrimination protections exist in state law.  The preemptive effect of this section did not \nfall equally on all North Carolinians, however.    \n \n129. Recognizing that North Carolina law had no statewide public \naccommodations protection of any kind except for people with disabilities, H.B. 2 \nactually enacted a new public accommodations statute—so that the other groups whose \nprotections also would have been preempted under the Charlotte Ordinance were spared \nthat result.  The new public accommodations statute prohibits discrimination based on \n“race, religion, color, national origin, or biological sex”—omitting the sexual orientation \nprotections that had been included in the Charlotte Ordinance. \n \n130. The North Carolina legislature has a history of targeted discrimination \ntoward lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.  For example, the legislature approved and \nreferred to voters a constitutional amendment barring access to marriage for same-sex \ncouples.  Legislative leaders also intervened in litigation challenging the constitutionality \nof the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage pursuant to a statute authorizing \nthem to act on behalf of the General Assembly.  In 2015, the legislature also passed a bill \nthat allows county magistrates to recuse themselves from performing civil marriages.  \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 32 of 45\n\n \n131. The preemptive effect of H.B. 2 also harmed transgender people as well.  \nWhile the Charlotte Ordinance had prohibited discrimination based on sex, gender \nidentity, and gender expression, the new public accommodations statute restricted its \nprotections solely to “biological sex,” which is defined in an effort to deliberately exclude \ntransgender people from protection.    \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \n \n132. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 131 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n \n133. Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants in their official \ncapacities for purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 2 \nboth facially and as applied to them. \n \n134. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \nA.  Sex Discrimination in Single-Sex Restrooms and Facilities (H.B. 2, Part \nI) \n \n \n135. Section A of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Equality \nNC, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Governor McCrory, Cooper, Board of \nGovernors, and Bissette. \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 33 of 45\n\n \n136. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n \n137. H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex. \n \n138. Discrimination based on sex includes but is not limited to discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition.   \n \n139. H.B. 2 facially classifies people based on sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status. \n \n140. H.B. 2 treats transgender people differently than non-transgender people \nwho are similarly situated.   \n \n141. Under H.B. 2, non-transgender people are able to access restrooms and \nother single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity, but transgender people are \nbanned from restrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n \n142. H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people based on gender \nnonconformity.  For example, although Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry are men, are \nperceived as men in public, and have had medical treatment to bring their body into \nalignment with their male gender identity, they have birth certificates with female gender \nmarkers that do not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for men.  Furthermore, if \ntransgender men such as Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry had been assigned male at birth, \n34 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 34 of 45\n\nthey would not be banned by H.B. 2 from the restrooms and other single-sex facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity.  No person has any control over the sex that person \nis assigned at birth. \n \n143. H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex is not \nsubstantially related to any important government interest.  Indeed, it is not even \nrationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n \n144. H.B. 2 endangers the safety, privacy, security, and well-being of \ntransgender individuals.  For example, if a transgender woman were to use the men’s \nrestroom, she likely would be harassed and might be assaulted by men who believed that \nshe should not be in the men’s restroom.  Similarly, if a transgender man were to use the \nwomen’s restroom, he likely would be harassed and might be assaulted by women who \nbelieve he should not be in the women’s restroom. \n \n145. H.B. 2 does not promote the safety, privacy, security, or well-being of non-\ntransgender people. \n \n146. H.B. 2 deprives transgender people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, \nand autonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n \n147. H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex denies \nthem the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n35 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 35 of 45\n\nB.   Sex and Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Preemption of Local \nNon-Discrimination Protections (H.B. 2, Part II, Sections 2.2 & 2.3; \nH.B. 2, Part III) \n \n \n148. Section B of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Gilmore, \nEquality NC, and ACLU of NC against Defendants Governor McCrory and Cooper.   \n \n149. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex and discrimination based on sexual orientation are \npresumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny. \n \n150. H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of protections against discrimination based \non sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. \n \n151. H.B. 2 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and \nworse, than other people, including by stripping them of the protections afforded by the \nCity of Charlotte’s Ordinance and precluding any local government from taking action to \nprotect LGBT people against discrimination.   \n \n152. H.B. 2 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging LGBT people and is \nbased on animus against LGBT people.  H.B. 2 was also enacted because of, and not in \nspite of, its adverse effects on LGBT people. \n \n153. The justifications cited in H.B. 2 for its enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, are pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for the bill.  For example, proposals to add \nsexual orientation and gender identity and expression protections to the statewide public \naccommodations law were rejected. \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 36 of 45\n\n \n154. By blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people at the local \nlevel, H.B. 2 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT people \nthan on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based \ndiscrimination.  H.B. 2 accordingly places a special burden on LGBT people within the \ngovernmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.   \n \n155. H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and \nautonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n \n156. H.B. 2’s discrimination against LGBT people based on sex and sexual \norientation denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nC.  Discrimination Based on Transgender Status Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n \n157. Transgender people have suffered a long history of extreme discrimination \nin North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such discrimination to \nthis day. \n \n158. Transgender people are a discrete and insular group and lack the political \npower to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Transgender people have \nlargely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal protections to protect them \nagainst discrimination.  \n \n159. A person’s gender identity or transgender status bears no relation to a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society. \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 37 of 45\n\n \n160. Gender identity is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n \n161. Gender identity generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \nD.  Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n \n162. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people have suffered a long history of extreme \ndiscrimination in North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such \ndiscrimination to this day. \n \n163. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are a discrete and insular group and lack \nthe political power to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Lesbian, gay, \nand bisexual people have largely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal \nprotections to protect them against discrimination. \n \n164. A person’s sexual orientation bears no relation to a person’s ability to \ncontribute to society. \n \n165. Sexual orientation is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n \n166. Sexual orientation generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 38 of 45\n\nCOUNT II \nViolation of Right to Privacy \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Equality NC, and ACLU of NC against Defendants \nGovernor McCrory, Cooper, Board of Governors, and Bissette \n \n \n167. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations \non state action that deprives individuals of life, liberty, or property.  \n \n168. Substantive protections of the Due Process Clause include the right to avoid \ndisclosure of sensitive, personal information.   \n \n169. There is a fundamental right of privacy in preventing the release of, and in \ndeciding in what circumstances to release: (1) personal information whose release could \nsubject them to bodily harm; and (2) information of a highly personal and intimate \nnature.  \n \n170. H.B. 2 requires the disclosure of highly personal information regarding \ntransgender people to each person who sees them using a restroom or other facility \ninconsistent with their gender identity or gender expression.  This disclosure places them \nat risk of bodily harm.   \n \n171. There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is H.B. \n2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  H.B. \n2 also is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n \n172. In addition, the privacy interests of transgender people that are invaded \noutweigh any purported interest the government could assert.  \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 39 of 45\n\nCOUNT III \nViolation of Liberty and Autonomy in the Right to Refuse Unwanted Medical \nTreatment \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, Equality NC, and ACLU of NC against Defendants \nGovernor McCrory, Cooper, Board of Governors, and Bissette \n \n \n173. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals’ \nsubstantive rights to be free to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion. \n \n174. The right to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion includes the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n \n175. H.B. 2 forces transgender people to undergo medical procedures that may \nnot be medically appropriate or available in order to access facilities consistent with their \ngender identity.  \n \n176. Not all transgender individuals undergo gender confirmation surgery.  For \nsome, the surgery is not medically necessary, while for others it is medically impossible.  \nFor example, because medical treatment for gender dysphoria is individualized, hormone \ntreatment may be sufficient to manage the distress associated with gender dysphoria for \nsome individuals.  Surgery may be medically necessary for others who do not have health \ninsurance coverage for it and cannot afford to pay for the surgery out-of-pocket.  \n \n177. Some states require proof of surgery before they will allow the gender \nmarker on a birth certificate to be changed.  For those born in North Carolina, state law \nrequires proof of “sex reassignment surgery.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 130A-11B.  \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 40 of 45\n\n \n178. For example, Mr. McGarry has not been able to amend his North Carolina \nbirth certificate to accurately reflect his gender because surgery is not medically \nnecessary for him.  Accordingly, H.B. 2 bans him from accessing restrooms and other \nfacilities consistent with his gender identity. \n \n179. There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is H.B. \n2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  H.B. \n2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of Title IX \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nPlaintiff Carcaño against Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n \n180. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 131 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n \n181. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \n \n182. Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination \non the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition. \n \n183. Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 41 of 45\n\n \n184. Defendant University of North Carolina is an executive branch agency as \ndefined by H.B. 2. \n \n185. Pursuant to H.B. 2, Defendant University of North Carolina “shall require \nevery multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be designated for and only \nused by persons based on their biological sex.” \n \n186. By requiring Mr. Carcaño – a transgender man – to use a restroom that is \ninconsistent with his gender identity, Defendant University of North Carolina excludes \nMr. Carcaño from participation in, denies him the benefits of, and subjects him to \ndiscrimination in educational programs and activities at Defendant’s constituent campus, \nUNC-Chapel Hill, “on the basis of sex,” which violates Mr. Carcaño’s rights under Title \nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of Title IX \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nPlaintiff McGarry against Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n \n187. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 131 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n \n188. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n42 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236   Document 1   Filed 03/28/16   Page 42 of 45\n\n \n189. Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination \non the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition. \n \n190. Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \n \n191. Defendant University of North Carolina is an executive branch agency as \ndefined by H.B. 2.    \n \n192. Pursuant to H.B. 2, Defendant University of North Carolina “shall require \nevery multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be designated for and only \nused by persons based on their biological sex.” \n \n193. By requiring Mr. McGarry – a transgender man – to use a restroom that is \ninconsistent with his gender identity, Defendant University of North Carolina excludes \nMr. McGarry from participation in, denies him the benefits of, and subjects him to \ndiscrimination in educational programs and activities at Defendant’s constituent campus, \nUNC-Greensboro, “on the basis of sex,” which violates Mr. McGarry’s rights under Title \nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:   \n \nA.

In light of the Joint Notice filed by the parties, the Court \nwill not set this matter for a status conference on August 26, 2016. \nHowever, it appears that a status conference in the near future would be \nappropriate, in order to address any discovery and scheduling issues. \nTherefore, the Court will plan to conduct a discovery status conference \non September 2, 2016, and given the potential issues to be addressed, the \nCourt will conduct that status conference in person rather than by \ntelephone hearing. Therefore, this matter will be set for a discovery \nstatus conference on September 2, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 3 of \nUnited States Courthouse in Winston-Salem, NC.

This lawsuit challenges a sweeping North Carolina law, House Bill 2 \n(“H.B. 2”), which bans transgender people from accessing restrooms and other facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity and blocks local governments from protecting \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) people against discrimination in a wide \nvariety of settings.  By singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly \nwriting discrimination against transgender people into state law, H.B. 2 violates the most \nbasic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  In February 2016, the City of Charlotte enacted an ordinance (the \n“Ordinance”) that extended existing municipal anti-discrimination protections to LGBT \npeople.  In light of the pervasive discrimination faced by LGBT people—and particularly \ntransgender people—advocates had long pressed the Charlotte City Council for these \nprotections.  Because North Carolina state law does not expressly prohibit discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity, many LGBT residents of Charlotte—as \nwell as LGBT residents throughout the state—are exposed to invidious discrimination in \ntheir day-to-day lives simply for being themselves.  After two hours-long hearings, in \nwhich there was extensive public comment on both sides of the issue, the Charlotte City \nCouncil voted to adopt the Ordinance.   \n3.  Before the Ordinance could take effect, the North Carolina General \nAssembly rushed to convene a special session with the express purpose of passing a \nstatewide law that would preempt Charlotte’s “radical” move to protect its residents from \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 2 of 58\n\n \ndiscrimination.  In a process rife with procedural irregularities, the legislature introduced \nand passed H.B. 2 in a matter of hours, and the Governor signed the bill into law that \nsame day.  Lawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality, \ninstead openly and virulently attacking transgender people, who were falsely portrayed as \npredatory and dangerous to others.  While the discriminatory, stated focus of the \nlegislature in passing H.B. 2—the use of restrooms by transgender people—is on its own \nillegal and unconstitutional, H.B. 2 in fact wreaks far greater damage by also prohibiting \nlocal governments in North Carolina from enacting express anti-discrimination \nprotections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n4.  Plaintiffs are individuals and a nonprofit organization whose members and \nconstituents will be directly impacted by H.B. 2.  Like the three transgender plaintiffs in \nthe case, transgender people around the state of North Carolina immediately suffered \nharm under H.B. 2 in that they are not able to access public restrooms and other single-\nsex facilities that accord with their gender identity.  Additionally, all LGBT people are \nharmed by H.B. 2 in that it strips them of, or bars them from, anti-discrimination \nprotections under local law.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that H.B. 2 violates \ntheir or their members’ constitutional and statutory rights to equal protection, liberty, \ndignity, autonomy, and privacy, as well as an injunction preliminarily and permanently \nenjoining enforcement by of H.B. 2 by Defendants, and nominal damages for the three \ntransgender plaintiffs in the case for violation of their federal statutory rights. \n \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 3 of 58\n\n \nPARTIES \nA.

Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño works for the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill (“UNC-Chapel Hill”) Institute for Global Health and Infectious Disease as a \nProject Coordinator.  The project that he coordinates provides medical education and \nservices such as HIV testing to the Latino/a population.   \n20.  Mr. Carcaño is a man.  \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 7 of 58\n\n \n21.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. Carcaño was recognized and treated like \nall other men at his job at UNC-Chapel Hill.  \n22.  Mr. Carcaño is transgender.  What that means is that his sex assigned at \nbirth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately \nreflect his gender identity, which is male.  \n23.  A person’s gender identity refers to the person’s internal sense of belonging \nto a particular gender.  There is a medical consensus that gender identity is innate and \nthat efforts to change a person’s gender identity are unethical and harmful to a person’s \nhealth and well-being. \n24.  The gender marker on a birth certificate is designated at the time of birth \ngenerally based upon the appearance of external genitalia.  However, determinations of \nsex can involve multiple factors, such as chromosomes, hormone levels, internal and \nexternal reproductive organs, and gender identity.   \n25.  Gender identity is the primary determinant of sex. \n26.  Mr. Carcaño was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical diagnosis \nfor the clinically significant distress that individuals whose gender identity differs from \nthe sex they were assigned at birth can experience. \n27.  Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that, if left untreated, can \nlead to clinical distress, debilitating depression, and even suicidal thoughts and acts.   \n28.  Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized in the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth ed. (2013) \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 8 of 58\n\n \n(DSM-V), and by the other leading medical and mental health professional groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association and the American Psychological \nAssociation. \n29.  Medical treatment for gender dysphoria must be individualized for the \nmedical needs of each patient.  \n30.  Treatment for gender dysphoria includes living one’s life consistent with \none’s gender identity, including when accessing single-sex spaces such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  \n31.  Forcing a transgender person to use single-sex spaces that do not match the \nperson’s gender identity is inconsistent with medical protocols and can cause anxiety and \ndistress to the transgender person and result in harassment of and violence against them.  \n32.  Mr. Carcaño was born and raised in South Texas.  Since a very young age, \naround 7 or 8 years old, Mr. Carcaño was aware that he did not feel like a girl, but he did \nnot know how to express how he felt. \n33.  Mr. Carcaño ultimately acknowledged his male gender identity to himself \nlater in his adult life. \n34.  Since 2013, Mr. Carcaño has been in the continuous care of a licensed \nmental health clinician, who diagnosed Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria.  Mr. Carcaño \ninitially sought treatment for depression, which was caused in part by his gender \ndysphoria. \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 9 of 58\n\n \n35.  Mental health and medical professionals worldwide recognize and follow \nthe evidence-based standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria developed by \nthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”).  After \ndiagnosing Mr. Carcaño with gender dysphoria, his therapist developed a course of \ntreatment consistent with those standards.  The goal of such treatment is to alleviate \ndistress by helping a person live congruently with the person’s gender identity, the \nprimary determinant of sex.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in January \n2015, Mr. Carcaño explained to his family and friends that he is a man. \n36.  A critical component of the WPATH Standards of Care is a social transition \nto living full-time consistently with the individual’s gender identity.  For Mr. Carcaño, \nthat includes living in accordance with his gender identity in all respects, including the \nuse of a male name and pronouns and use of the men’s restrooms. \n37.  For transgender people, it is critical that social transition include transition \nin the workplace, including with respect to restrooms.  Excluding a transgender man from \nthe restroom that corresponds to his gender identity, or forcing him to use a separate \nfacility from other men, communicates to the entire workplace that he should not be \nrecognized as a man and undermines the social transition process. \n38.  Mr. Carcaño also began using Joaquín as his first name in January 2015.  \nHis friends, family, and coworkers now recognize him as a man, and they refer to him \nusing his male name and male pronouns. \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 10 of 58\n\n \n39.  Also consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño’s \nphysician recommended and prescribed hormone treatment, which Mr. Carcaño has \nreceived since May 2015.  For both hormone therapy and surgical treatment, the WPATH \nStandards of Care require persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria, which is a \ncriterion that Mr. Carcaño satisfied.  Among other therapeutic benefits, the hormone \ntreatment has deepened Mr. Carcaño’s voice, increased his growth of facial hair, and \ngiven him a more masculine appearance.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress Mr. \nCarcaño experienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his \nidentity and helped him to feel more comfortable with who he is.  \n40.  As part of the treatment for his gender dysphoria, Mr. Carcaño also \nobtained a bilateral mastectomy and nipple reconstruction (also known as “top surgery”) \nin January 2016.  Consistent with WPATH Standards of Care, Mr. Carcaño satisfied the \nrequirement of having a referral from a qualified mental health professional in order to \nobtain the surgical treatment. \n41.  As part of his social transition, Mr. Carcaño began using the men’s \nrestroom at work and elsewhere in late 2015, which occurred without incident for the five \nmonths or so before H.B. 2’s enactment.  Mr. Carcaño’s therapist had also specifically \nrecommended that he use only the men’s restroom.  She was concerned that using the \nwomen’s restroom could compromise his mental health, well-being, and safety.  By late \n2015, Mr. Carcaño had facial hair facilitated by hormone treatment, and his therapist \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 11 of 58\n\n \nindicated that others would recognize Mr. Carcaño as a man based on his physical \nappearance. \n42.  Mr. Carcaño is now comfortable with the status of his treatment and, with \nthe exception of the distress now caused by the passage of H.B. 2, his distress has been \nmanaged through the clinically recommended treatment he has received.  He plans to \ncontinue treatment under the supervision of medical professionals and based on his \nmedical needs.  \n43.  Apart from the building where he works, Mr. Carcaño also used other \nmen’s restrooms on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus without incident for approximately \nfive months prior to H.B. 2’s passage.  In addition, when out in public, such as at \nrestaurants and stores, Mr. Carcaño uses the men’s restroom. \n44.  The only restrooms on the floor where Mr. Carcaño works at UNC-Chapel \nHill are designated either for men or for women.  H.B. 2 thus excludes him from using \nthe same restrooms that his coworkers typically use.  This exclusion is stigmatizing and \nmarks him as different and lesser than other men. \n45.  Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. Carcaño, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. Carcaño to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment.  \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 12 of 58\n\n \n46.  The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. Carcaño to \nexperience significant anxiety, as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n47.  In the initial period after H.B. 2’s passage, Mr. Carcaño generally used a \nsingle-occupancy restroom not designated either for men or for women in another \nbuilding on campus, which was approximately a 10-15 minute walk away from his \nbuilding each way.   \n48.  Mr. Carcaño was subsequently informed by administrative staff in the \nbuilding where he works that they had learned of a single-occupancy restroom based on \nbuilding floor plans.  It is accessible using a special service elevator, and the restroom is \ntucked away in a cubby down a hallway in a part of the building used for housekeeping. \n49.  Mr. Carcaño is not only humiliated by being singled out and forced to use a \nseparate restroom from his colleagues and all other men that he works with, but also \nburdened by having to use a separate restroom on a different floor, which increases the \nlikelihood that he will delay or avoid going to the restroom.  \n50.  Mr. Carcaño also visits public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, as part of his job \nat UNC-Chapel Hill, Mr. Carcaño has had to visit the offices of the North Carolina \nDepartment of Health and Human Services many times in the past, and he will continue \nto need to do so in the future.  Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, he used the men’s restroom \nwhile at their office, but he will be banned from doing so in the future under H.B. 2. \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 13 of 58\n\n \n51.  Mr. Carcaño has also visited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s \nlicense) and anticipates doing so again in the future, where he will be banned from using \nthe men’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n52.  Mr. Carcaño also regularly uses the North Carolina Rest Area System, \nwhich maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation.  For example, he uses the restrooms provided by that \nsystem when he travels approximately once a month to visit his brother in Atlanta, and \nwhen he visits Washington, D.C. periodically.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n53.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. Carcaño’s knowledge, \ncomplaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n54.  Mr. Carcaño, who is an employee of the University of North Carolina \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), has exhausted administrative remedies \nbefore the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) with respect to his \nrights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  He filed a charge of discrimination \nwith the EEOC on April 20, 2016 alleging that UNC had violated Title VII’s prohibition \nagainst sex discrimination.  He requested his right to sue on October 19, 2016, after at \nleast 180 days had elapsed from the filing of his charge, and he received his right to sue \non November 21, 2016. \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 14 of 58\n\n \n55.  Mr. Carcaño is a member of the ACLU of NC.   \n56.  Plaintiff Payton Grey McGarry is a full-time student at the University of \nNorth Carolina at Greensboro (“UNC-Greensboro”), where he is double majoring in \nBusiness Administration and Accounting.  He is also a skilled musician and has played \ntrumpet in many ensembles at UNC-Greensboro.  He plays the guitar, baritone, clarinet, \nand saxophone. \n57.  Mr. McGarry is close to his family and has a younger brother who is also a \nmember of the LGBT community.  Mr. McGarry hopes to use his education to eventually \ngo to law school and work to defend people’s civil rights. \n58.  Mr. McGarry is a man.  \n59.  Mr. McGarry is transgender.  As is true for Mr. Carcaño, Mr. McGarry’s \nsex assigned at birth was female, as his birth certificate reflects, but that designation does \nnot conform to his gender identity, which is male.   \n60.  Mr. McGarry was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n61.  Mr. McGarry was born and raised in Wilson, North Carolina.  Throughout \nhis childhood, Mr. McGarry felt like a boy and never really thought of himself as a girl.  \nIt was not until he started to go through puberty that he began to wrestle with the \ndisconnect between his identity as a boy and his assigned birth sex.  \n62.  Mr. McGarry realized while he was in high school that he is transgender. \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 15 of 58\n\n \n63.  In October 2013, during his senior year in high school, Mr. McGarry began \nmental health treatment with a licensed clinical social worker who diagnosed him with \ngender dysphoria.  \n64.  After diagnosing Mr. McGarry with gender dysphoria, his therapist \ndeveloped a course of treatment in accordance with medical standards for treating the \ncondition.   \n65.  Consistent with that treatment and his identity, in the fall and winter of \n2013, Mr. McGarry explained to his friends and family that he is male and began to use \nmale pronouns.  \n66.  In April 2014, under the care of an endocrinologist, Mr. McGarry began \nhormone therapy.  This treatment helped alleviate the distress that Mr. McGarry \nexperienced due to the discordance between his birth-assigned sex and his identity and \nhelped him to feel more comfortable with who he is. \n67.  By the time he graduated high school in June 2014, Mr. McGarry used the \nname Payton and male pronouns in all aspects of his life.  He is known as Payton \nMcGarry to his family, friends, and peers, although he has not yet changed his legal first \nname to Payton. \n68.  In the fall of 2014, Mr. McGarry enrolled as a freshman at UNC-\nGreensboro as Payton McGarry and as male. \n69.  Since arriving at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. McGarry has identified and has \nbeen known to others as male for all purposes. \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 16 of 58\n\n \n70.  Mr. McGarry is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity, \nand is the Vice President of the Iota Epsilon Chapter of that fraternity.  His fraternity \nbrothers are aware that he is transgender and have no concerns with his use of men’s \nrestrooms and locker rooms. \n71.  Though Mr. McGarry currently lives off campus, he is on campus six or \nseven days per week and always used the restroom designed for men in on-campus \nbuildings prior to the passage of H.B. 2.  He also used the locker room facilities at UNC-\nGreensboro and always used the facilities designed for men before passage of H.B. 2.  \n72.  For the past year and a half since he enrolled at UNC-Greensboro, Mr. \nMcGarry has used the men’s restrooms and locker rooms on-campus without incident.  \nMr. McGarry is unaware of any instance in which any person has complained about his \nuse of the men’s restroom or locker room.  \n73.  Mr. McGarry works part-time as a visual technician for marching bands at \ndifferent high schools around the state and regularly uses the bathroom for men when \nworking as a visual technician.  There have been no incidents or, to the best of Mr. \nMcGarry’s knowledge, complaints related to his use of the restrooms designated for men. \n74.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, Mr. \nMcGarry always uses the men’s restroom. \n75.  To Mr. McGarry’s knowledge, there are very few single-user restrooms on \nthe UNC-Greensboro campus, and there are no single-user bathrooms in many buildings \nwhere he has classes. \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 17 of 58\n\n \n76.  If Mr. McGarry could not use the men’s restroom at UNC-Greensboro, he \nwould have to search for single-user restrooms outside of the buildings where his classes \nare held every time he had to use the restroom.  This would disrupt his ability to attend \nclass and would interfere with his educational opportunities.  Expelling him from the \nmultiple occupancy restrooms and locker rooms available to all other male students is \nstigmatizing and marks him as different and lesser than other men. \n77.  Since he started testosterone two years ago, Mr. McGarry’s voice has \ndeepened and his face and body have become more traditionally masculine in \nappearance. \n78.  Using the women’s restroom is not a viable option for Mr. McGarry, just as \nit would not be a viable option for non-transgender men to be forced to use the women’s \nrestroom.  Forcing Mr. McGarry to use the women’s restroom would also cause \nsubstantial harm to his mental health and well-being.  It would also force him to disclose \nto others the fact that he is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment. \n79.  The idea of being forced into the women’s restroom causes Mr. McGarry to \nexperience significant anxiety, as he knows that it would be distressing for him and \nuncomfortable for others.  He fears for his safety because of the passage of H.B. 2.  \n80.  Since the passage of H.B. 2, Mr. McGarry has been barred from using the \nmen’s restrooms on campus.  Given that he cannot use the women’s restroom and there \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 18 of 58\n\n \nare only a few available single-user restrooms, he often avoids going to the restroom all \nday.  \n81.  Mr. McGarry has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 143-760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, Mr. McGarry has \nvisited the Division of Motor Vehicles under the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation on prior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s license) and anticipates doing \nso again in the future, where he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n82.  Mr. McGarry also has used and will continue to use the North Carolina \nRest Area System, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by \nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation.  He will need to continue to use those \nrestrooms in the future, but he will be banned from using the men’s restroom under \nH.B. 2. \n83.  Plaintiff H.S. is a senior at the University of North Carolina School of the \nArts High School (“UNCSA-HS”).  The oldest of four children, she is close to her family, \nwho love and support her.  She is an accomplished artist and studies visual arts at \nUNCSA-HS. \n84.  H.S. is a girl. \n85.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. was recognized as a girl at school and \nwhen out in public. \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 19 of 58\n\n \n86.  H.S. is transgender.  She was assigned the sex of male at birth, as her birth \ncertificate reflects, but that designation does not accurately reflect her gender identity, \nwhich is female. \n87.  H.S. has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n88.  H.S. was born in New Jersey but moved to North Carolina when she was 11 \nyears old.  From as young an age two or three, H.S. gravitated towards clothing and toys \ngenerally associated with girls.  Like many other girls, she would always want to wear \nthe pink princess dresses at pre-school and to play with Barbie dolls. \n89.  After completing pre-school, H.S. did not feel comfortable expressing her \nidentity as a girl and tried to immerse herself in traditionally masculine spaces and \nactivities.  She tried to do things that she felt she was supposed to do as a boy.  But \nnothing felt right. \n90.  Starting in seventh grade, H.S. again began to gravitate toward clothes and \nactivities that were considered more feminine. \n91.  By eighth grade, H.S. again began to express a more stereotypically \nfeminine gender and at times would wear makeup and high-heel shoes at school. \n92.  As puberty began to approach in ninth grade, severe gender dysphoria and \nanxiety began to hit H.S., and she experienced significant distress around her body and \nidentity.  She finally went to her parents, who recognized that she was suffering. \n93.  In ninth grade, H.S. began therapy with an expert on treating transgender \nyoung people and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 20 of 58\n\n \n94.  In 2013, H.S. started high school at Broughton High School in Raleigh.  In \nthe middle of her freshman year, H.S. began hormone blockers to prevent the onset of \nmale puberty and the development of secondary sex characteristics associated with men. \nThis treatment delayed puberty while H.S. continued to understand her female identity.  \nThough H.S. continued to experience some distress and dysphoria, the hormone blockers \ngreatly reduced her suffering. \n95.  At the end of ninth grade, H.S. felt fully comfortable embracing her identity \nas a girl at school and had the full support of her parents.  On the last day of school her \nfreshman year, H.S. wore a skirt to school that her mother had purchased for her.  It was \nan important and symbolic turning point in her comfort with and embrace of her identity \nas a girl. \n96.  By sophomore year, H.S. was perceived as a girl and began to use the girls’ \nbathroom at school and in public.  She was also known by female pronouns—such as she, \nher, and hers—by this time. \n97.  During her sophomore year, H.S. was elected to the Queen’s Court at her \nschool, an honor that had, in the seventy-five years of the tradition, been shared only \namong non-transgender girls.  \n98.  Under the care of her endocrinologist, during her sophomore year in high \nschool, H.S. continued to assess her medical treatment for gender dysphoria and began to \nconsider hormone replacement therapy.  At the end of her sophomore year, in the spring \nof 2015, H.S. began estrogen therapy to continue her medical transition. \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 21 of 58\n\n \n99.  An accomplished visual artist, H.S. applied to the UNCSA-HS for her \njunior year and was accepted. \n100.  In the fall of 2015, H.S. moved to Winston-Salem to attend UNCSA-HS as \na boarding student.  She studies visual arts and aspires to a career in fashion. \n101.  H.S. lives in the girls’ dormitory at UNCSA-HS. \n102.  Until the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. exclusively used the girls’ restroom at \nschool and could not imagine ever using a restroom designated for boys.  H.S. is unaware \nof any instance in which any person has complained about her use of the girls’ restroom.  \n103.  In addition, when out in public, such as at restaurants and stores, H.S. uses \nthe restrooms designated for women and girls. \n104.  Outside of H.S.’s dorm room, there were no single-user restrooms available \nto her at UNCSA-HS in the spring semester of 2016, and it was disruptive to H.S.’s \neducation to have to avoid the use of the restroom or to return to her room or locate a \nsingle-user restroom off campus every time she needed to go to the restroom.  H.S. is also \nunaware of single-user restrooms that are readily available to her in all the buildings \nwhere she has class in the fall semester of 2016. \n105.  Forcing H.S. out of spaces shared with her female peers is stigmatizing and \nmarks her as different and lesser than other girls at school. \n106.  Particularly because she never went through puberty as a boy and began \nestrogen treatment earlier this year, H.S. has a traditionally feminine appearance.  She is \nrecognized as female in all aspects of her life. \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 22 of 58\n\n \n107.  Using the boys’ or men’s restroom is not a viable option for H.S., just as it \nwould not be a viable option for non-transgender women and girls to be forced to use the \nrestrooms designated for men and boys.  Forcing H.S. to use the restroom designated for \nmen and boys would also cause substantial harm to her mental health and well-being and \nwould put her in danger of harassment and violence.  It would also force her to disclose \nto others the fact that she is transgender, which itself could lead to violence and \nharassment. \n108.  The idea of being forced into the restroom designated for boys and men at \nschool and in public causes H.S. to experience significant anxiety and brings up painful \nmemories and anxiety from her earlier childhood.  She fears for her safety because of the \npassage of H.B. 2.  \n109.  Since the passage of H.B. 2, H.S. has limited or delayed use of the \nbathroom because of fear of reprisals if she uses the restroom designated for women and \ngirls and because she fears for her safety if she uses the restroom designated for men and \nboys, as the law requires.  \n110.  H.S. has also visited public agencies as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-\n760(4), and intends to and will do so in the future.  For example, H.S. has visited the \nDivision of Motor Vehicles under the North Carolina Department of Transportation on \nprior occasions (e.g., to obtain a driver’s license) and anticipates doing so again in the \nfuture, where she will be banned from using the women’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 23 of 58\n\n \n111.  H.S. has used and will continue to use the North Carolina Rest Area \nSystem, which maintains public restrooms along highways and is operated by the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation.  She will need to continue to use those restrooms \nin the future, but she will be banned from using the women’s restroom under H.B. 2. \n112.  Plaintiff Angela Gilmore is a resident of Durham, North Carolina.  \nMs. Gilmore has lived in North Carolina since 2011, when she moved from Florida to \ntake a job at North Carolina Central University.  She is currently the Associate Dean for \nAcademic Affairs and Professor of Law at North Carolina Central University.   \n113.  Ms. Gilmore is a lesbian, and has been in a relationship with her wife, \nAngela Wallace, for almost twenty years.  Ms. Gilmore and Ms. Wallace were married in \nWashington, D.C. in 2014.  \n114.  Ms. Gilmore looked for and accepted a job in North Carolina, after she and \nher wife fell in love with the state during a visiting teaching job Ms. Gilmore had at Elon \nUniversity School of Law in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2010.   \n115.  Both Ms. Gilmore and her wife, African American lesbians, felt that North \nCarolina, and Durham in particular, was a place where they could be fully themselves, \ncomfortable in terms of both their race and sexual orientation.   \n116.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife love living in Durham—they feel very much part \nof the community—and prior to the passage of H.B. 2, they had been looking at small \ntowns in North Carolina where they might want to retire. \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 24 of 58\n\n \n117.  Since moving to North Carolina, Ms. Gilmore has worked towards \nincreasing non-discrimination protections for LGBT people.  Ms. Gilmore is a member of \nthe ACLU of NC, and she was on the ACLU of NC board between 2014 and 2015.  \nDuring that time, the ACLU of NC actively worked to defeat anti-LGBT bills proposed \nin the state legislature and to pass local ordinances, like the Ordinance, and to protect \nLGBT people from discrimination at the local level.  Ms. Gilmore also has spoken on \npanels at her law school and other law schools regarding non-discrimination protections \nfor LGBT people. \n118.  The passage of H.B. 2 has caused Ms. Gilmore and her wife distress, in that \nit has significantly undone their sense of belonging and value in the state, which is why \nthey moved to North Carolina.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife experience H.B. 2 as sending a \nclear message to them as lesbians that they are not welcome in North Carolina. \n119.  Ms. Gilmore and her wife have visited the City of Charlotte and they plan \nto do so in the future.  As two women traveling together with the same first name, they \nare often asked about the nature of their relationship, and they therefore regularly reveal \nthemselves to be a lesbian couple.  Under the Ordinance, Ms. Gilmore and her wife \nwould have been protected from sexual orientation discrimination in public \naccommodations in the City of Charlotte.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore \nworries that she and her wife will now be exposed to discrimination based on their sexual \norientation. \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 25 of 58\n\n \n120.  With the passage of H.B. 2, Ms. Gilmore also is limited in her ability to \nincrease and benefit from non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in North \nCarolina.  Were she able to, Ms. Gilmore would continue to advocate for local ordinances \nthat prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n121.  As a non-transgender woman who always uses the facilities designated for \nwomen in both public and private spaces, Ms. Gilmore does not feel safer in these \nfacilities because of the passage of H.B. 2. \nB.  The City of Charlotte’s Enactment of a Non-Discrimination \nOrdinance. \n \n122.  Advocates have long worked for the passage of an ordinance that would \nensure that LGBT people were expressly protected from discrimination within the City of \nCharlotte.  Prior to the vote on the Ordinance, there had been an earlier round of intensive \npublic engagement in late 2014 to early 2015, when the Charlotte City Council \npreviously considered expanding non-discrimination protections to include sexual \norientation and gender identity and expression. \n123.  There was again extensive discussion and deliberation leading up to the \nFebruary 2016 vote on the Ordinance.  The Charlotte City Council heard hours of robust \npublic comment in a forum that included hundreds of people—both those who were in \nsupport of the Ordinance and those who were in opposition to the Ordinance.  The \nCharlotte City Council also received significant legal analysis from the Office of the City \nAttorney regarding its authority to enact the Ordinance and the effect of the Ordinance.  \n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 26 of 58\n\n \n124.  The impetus for the Ordinance is the reality that LGBT people often face \npervasive discrimination.  Although same-sex couples may now marry throughout the \nUnited States as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell, lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual people remain vulnerable to discrimination in states like North Carolina \nwhere there is no express protection for sexual orientation in state law, making local anti-\ndiscrimination protections even more vital.  Discrimination is especially pervasive for \ntransgender people, as evidenced by a 2011 national study of transgender Americans, \nInjustice at Every Turn, which documented the high levels of harassment, discrimination, \nand violence that transgender people have faced and continue to face. \n125.  In the 2011 national report cited above, 90% of respondents reported being \nharassed at work or taking actions to avoid harassment, while 26% reported being fired \nbecause they are transgender.  Forty-seven percent reported some form of employment \ndiscrimination because they are transgender, including not being hired, not being \npromoted, or being fired.  Fifty-three percent reported being verbally harassed or \ndisrespected in a place of public accommodation, and 22% reported being denied equal \ntreatment by a government agency or official because they are transgender. \n126.  In 2013, it was estimated that there were more than 250,000 LGBT adults \nin North Carolina, out of an adult population of approximately eight million people.  \nAmong this population of North Carolinians, there are an estimated 37,800 transgender \npeople (of any age), including 15,600 individuals who are 13 to 19 years old.  While \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 27 of 58\n\n \ntransgender individuals only make up a small minority of the population, they are \ndisproportionately targeted for hate crimes in the United States. \n127.  On Monday, February 22, 2016, by a 7-to-4 vote, the Charlotte City \nCouncil approved the Ordinance, which, inter alia, amended its existing public \naccommodations protections by barring discrimination in public accommodations based \non “gender identity, gender expression” and “sexual orientation.” \n128.  The City Council’s vote was met with a firestorm of opposition from vocal \nopponents of the part of the Ordinance that would have required certain public \naccommodations to allow transgender people to use single-sex facilities, such as \nrestrooms and locker rooms, in accordance with their gender identity. \n129.  Opponents of the Ordinance distorted the truth of what the Ordinance’s \nnon-discrimination requirement would accomplish and formed a vocal campaign \ndecrying a purported attempt to permit “men in women’s restrooms.” \nC.  The Events Leading to H.B. 2, Contemporary Statements by \nDecisionmakers, and Departures From the Normal Legislative Process \nRevealed a Series of Official Actions Taken for Invidious Purposes.   \n \n130.  The State of North Carolina has rarely, if ever, exercised authority to \npreempt local ordinances providing broader protections than under state law.  For \nexample, in 1968 Charlotte adopted an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in public \naccommodations on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.  In 1972, the \nCouncil amended the ordinance to prohibit discrimination based on sex, which the \nCouncil further modified in 1985. \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 28 of 58\n\n \n131.  Even though all of these protections extended beyond the reach of the \nState’s public accommodations law, which until H.B. 2 prohibited only public \naccommodations discrimination based on disability, the State allowed Charlotte’s \nordinance to stand undisturbed for decades.  It was only after Charlotte took steps to \nprotect LGBT people that the State rushed to preempt the ordinance. \n132.  Even before the Charlotte City Council had cast its vote on the Ordinance, \nGovernor McCrory informed Charlotte City Council members that the State would likely \ntake immediate action to put a halt to the Ordinance—even as Governor McCrory \nconceded that was an exceedingly unusual step.  In an email to Charlotte City Council \nmembers, Governor McCrory noted that he “made a point as the former 14 year Mayor \nand current Governor to stay out of specific issues being voted on by the Charlotte City \nCouncil.”  Governor McCrory nonetheless characterized the Ordinance’s non-\ndiscrimination protections for LGBT people as “changing basic long-established values \nand norms” surrounding “public restrooms,” and he ominously warned of “possible \ndanger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  \nGovernor McCrory said that the Ordinance would “most likely cause immediate State \nlegislative intervention which I would support as governor.”    \n133.  On Tuesday, February 23, 2016, the Speaker of the North Carolina House \nof Representatives, Tim Moore (“Speaker Moore”), issued a press release announcing \nthat he would work with fellow Republicans to explore a “legislative intervention to \ncorrect [Charlotte’s] radical course.” \n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 29 of 58\n\n \n134.  In North Carolina, it is the state’s Governor who typically calls a special \nsession, but in this case, Governor McCrory refused to call a special session because he \nwas concerned that the legislature would go beyond addressing the Charlotte Ordinance. \n135.  As a result of the Governor’s refusal to call a special session, legislative \nleaders opted for a rarely used law that allows special sessions when three-fifths of \nlegislators in both chambers support the call.  That provision in the state constitution had \nnot been used since 1981, according to Lt. Governor Dan Forest’s chief of staff, Hal \nWeatherman.  The special session cost approximately $42,000 to convene.   \n136.  The text of H.B. 2, which was named the “Public Facilities Privacy and \nSecurity Act,” was not shared with most legislators until they arrived to debate the bill. \n137.  North Carolina House of Representatives Minority Leader Larry Hall \n(“Minority Leader Hall”) stated “We don’t know what we’re discussing here, we don’t \nknow what we’re voting on.  What we’re doing is a perversion of the process.” \n138.  Minority Leader Hall said that Democrats were initially told that the special \nsession would take place on Thursday, March 24, 2016, when instead the special session \nwas held on March 23, 2016.  Minority Leader Hall stated that, as a result, a number of \nlegislators were “caught off guard” and were “scrambling to try to come back” for the \nsession. \n139.  The special session, which lasted a single day, was substantially shorter \nthan previous special sessions.  Before H.B. 2 had been filed, Speaker Moore announced \nthat the committee hearing for the bill would begin five minutes after introduction of the \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 30 of 58\n\n \nbill and adjournment of the morning session.  Shortly thereafter, approximately twelve \nminutes after the House came to order, H.B. 2 was filed—the first time it was officially \nmade available to the public or the legislators.   \n140.  Approximately three minutes after H.B. 2 was filed, the chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary IV Committee—the committee to which H.B. 2 was assigned—stated, in \nresponse to a fellow member’s question, that it was his “intention” to permit time for \npublic comment on the bill during the committee hearing.  Upon information and belief, \nno prior public notice of the time and place for public comment on H.B. 2 was provided. \n141.  Only forty-five minutes were allotted for public comment, which was \ninsufficient to permit those who had signed up to speak on H.B. 2 to be heard. \n142.  In response to complaints during the committee hearing that members had \nnot been given an opportunity to read the text of H.B. 2, the chairman permitted a five-\nminute break to allow members to read the bill. \n143.  After a favorable referral from the House Judiciary IV Committee, H.B. 2 \nreceived only three hours of debate in the House, after which it was passed and referred \nto the Senate. \n144.  The roll call for H.B. 2 in the Senate was called after all Democratic \nmembers of the Senate walked out of the chambers in protest, with North Carolina State \nSenate Democratic Leader Dan Blue calling the special session an “affront to democracy” \nand stating that the Democratic caucus in the Senate “choose[s] not to participate in this \nfarce.”  With every Democratic member absent, the Senate passed H.B. 2 unanimously. \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 31 of 58\n\n \n145.  Comments made by lawmakers both during the debate, in the press, and \nthrough their social media used vitriolic language to make clear their aim at undoing \nCharlotte’s protections for LGBT people: \na.  North Carolina State Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger’s \ndescriptions of the legislature’s work included:   \ni.  “Senate unanimously votes to stop radical ordinance allowing \nmen into public bathrooms with women and young girls.” \nii.  “Lawmakers were forced to come back to session to address \nthe serious safety concerns created by the dangerous ordinance—which violated existing \nstate criminal trespass law, indecent exposure law and building codes and created a \nloophole that any man with nefarious motives could use to prey on women and young \nchildren . . .” \niii.  “How many fathers are now going to be forced to go to the \nladies’ room to make sure their little girls aren’t molested?” \nb.  North Carolina State Senator Buck Newton said, “The Charlotte City \nCouncil should have never passed this unlawful and reckless bathroom and locker room \nordinance.  Politics have reached a new extreme when a municipality’s top priority is \nallowing men into women’s bathrooms and locker rooms.  But tens of thousands of our \nconstituents from across the state have called on us to stand up to the political correctness \nmob, fight for common sense and put a stop to this nonsense once and for all.” \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 32 of 58\n\n \nc.  North Carolina State Senator David Curtis (“Senator Curtis”) said, \n“This liberal group is trying to redefine everything about our society.  Gender and \nmarriage — just the whole liberal agenda.”  Senator Curtis added that while, “We \ngenerally don’t get involved in local politics.  We need to do what’s right.”  Senator \nCurtis said that H.B. 2 was necessary because, “The gays would go into a business, make \nsome outrageous demand that they know the owner cannot comply with and file a lawsuit \nagainst that business owner and put him out of business.”  Senator Curtis suggested that \nH.B. 2 was broadly drafted specifically for the purpose of defending the bathroom \nprovision it in court: “[w]e feel like we can successfully defend the law and the fact that \nwe made the law much broader,” explaining that “[i]n addition to the bathroom issue we \nrestricted the rights of cities and towns to impose a higher minimum wage.  The bill has \nto do with restricting rights of cities and counties.  I suspect we will defend it based on \nthat.” \nd.  North Carolina State Senator Andrew Brock said, “You know, \n$42,000 is not going to cover the medical expenses when a pervert walks into a bathroom \nand my little girls are in there.”  \ne.  Speaker Moore said “They want to protect adults who feel \ncompelled to dress up like the opposite sex.  I, on the other hand, oppose the ordinance to \nprotect children, who from the time they’ve been potty trained, know to go into the \nbathroom of their god given appropriate gender.  Honestly, it’s ridiculous we are even \nhaving this discussion.  I look forward to invalidating this ordinance as soon as possible.” \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 33 of 58\n\n \nf.  North Carolina State Representative Mark Brody said Charlotte’s \nordinance “violates my Christian values and it violates decency values,” adding that he \n“had to stop it.”  Representative Brody further stated that “[t]he homosexual community \nhas just stepped too far and that had to stop and that’s my basic opinion,” noting that \n“[t]his is driven by the homosexual community and they’re emboldened by their victory \nin the courts on homosexual marriage.”  Brody elaborated further that H.B. 2 “sends a \nmessage to these municipalities who have been taken over by the liberal, homosexual, \nprohomosexual ideology that we are going to stick up for traditional values and we’ll \nstick up for them constantly if that’s what we have to do.” \ng.  North Carolina State Representative John Blust opined that he \n“think[s] it’s ridiculous that your anatomy isn’t what governs what restroom you use,” \nadding that he does not “understand why they have to make way for this .0001 percent of \nthe population.” \n146.  Debate in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly focused \nspecifically on reversing the Charlotte Ordinance, with lawmakers in both chambers \ncondemning the anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people, including transgender \nindividuals’ right to use facilities in accordance with their gender identity.   \n147.  Fewer than 10 hours after it was introduced, the bill passed both houses.  \nGovernor McCrory signed the bill that same night, issuing a signing statement making \nclear once again the targets of H.B. 2.  His signing statement said, “This radical breach of \ntrust and security under the false argument of equal access not only impacts the citizens \n34 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 34 of 58\n\n \nof Charlotte but people who come to Charlotte to work, visit or play.  This new \ngovernment regulation defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, \nfor example, a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.”  H.B. 2 took \neffect immediately.   \nD.  H.B. 2 Harms Transgender People. \n148.  H.B. 2 amended North Carolina’s General Statutes to mandate that school \nboards require students to use restrooms and other single-sex facilities in accordance with \ntheir “biological sex” providing that,  \nLocal boards of education shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used \nonly by students based on their biological sex. \n \n149.  H.B. 2 also imposes the same mandate on all executive branch agencies \n(which are expressly defined to include Defendant University of North Carolina), and all \npublic agencies, providing that they \nshall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be \ndesignated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex.   \n \n150.  Each of those provisions defines “biological sex” as follows, \n \nBiological sex. – The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated \non a person’s birth certificate.  \n \n151.  Changing the gender marker on one’s birth certificate is not a viable option \nfor many transgender people, as every jurisdiction has a different set of often onerous and \nunnecessary requirements for updating the gender listed on a birth certificate. \n35 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 35 of 58\n\n \n152.  For instance, a person born in North Carolina can only update the gender \nmarker listed on a North Carolina-issued birth certificate with proof of certain surgeries \nthat may not be medically necessary, advisable, or affordable for any given person.  \nMeanwhile, a person born in neighboring Tennessee can never change the gender listed \non a Tennessee-issued birth certificate. \n153.  Medical treatment such as the surgery required to update a person’s North \nCarolina birth certificate does not alter a person’s gender (or what H.B. 2 calls \n“biological sex”), but rather merely brings a person’s body into alignment with the \ngender they have always been.  Gender identity is instead the chief determinant of a \nperson’s gender.  \n154.  H.B. 2’s provisions requiring use of single-sex facilities in accordance with \nthe sex stated on their birth certificate not only disproportionately burdens transgender \npeople, but intentionally targets them for differential treatment.  Lawmakers made clear \nthat H.B. 2 was specifically aimed at transgender people.  For example, an FAQ released \nby Governor McCrory after H.B. 2’s enactment states, “Why did North Carolina pass this \nlaw in the first place?  Answer:  The bill was passed after the Charlotte City Council \nvoted to impose a regulation requiring businesses to allow a man into a women’s \nrestroom, shower, or locker room if they choose,” even though it does not do that, but \nonly allows a transgender woman to use a women’s restroom or other multiple user \nfacility for women and a transgender man to use a men’s restroom or other multiple user \nfacility for men.  \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 36 of 58\n\n \n155.  Prior to the passage of H.B. 2, it was already illegal for a person to enter a \nrestroom or locker room to assault or injure another.  Moreover, protecting transgender \npeople from discrimination in public accommodations, as has been done in numerous \nstates and hundreds of localities, has resulted in no increase in public safety incidents in \nany jurisdiction anywhere in the United States, and including transgender people in \npublic life in no way impacts the safety or well-being of non-transgender people. \n156.  The painful message of stigma sent by H.B. 2 echoes the dehumanizing \nrhetoric employed by a number of lawmakers, suggesting that transgender people are \nsomehow predatory or dangerous to others.  In fact, it is H.B. 2 that exposes transgender \npeople to harassment and potential violence.  Transgender people are already \ndisproportionately targeted for physical violence and harassment in North Carolina and \nacross the country.  When a transgender person is forced to disclose their transgender \nstatus to strangers, such disclosure puts them at a high risk for violence.  H.B. 2’s \nrequirement that transgender people be shunted into single-sex spaces that do not match \ntheir gender identity invades their privacy and exposes this vulnerable population to \nharassment and potential violence by others. \n157.  Upon information and belief, after the enactment of H.B. 2, some school \nofficials that had been respecting their students’ gender identity without any problem \ncalled parents to say that their children would be forced out of the single-sex facilities \nthat match their gender identity.   \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 37 of 58\n\n \n158.  H.B. 2’s broad sweep means that the same result applies to executive and \npublic agencies, including routine places such as libraries, public health centers, airports, \nand the Division of Motor Vehicles, as well as places where people may turn in times of \ncrisis, such as state hospitals, police departments, and courthouses.  Transgender \nindividuals working in such agencies may not be able to safely use any bathroom any \nlonger, threatening their ability to keep their job. \n159.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, the City Attorney of the City of \nCharlotte issued a memorandum dated April 1, 2016 to the Mayor and City Council of \nthe City of Charlotte, regarding the effect of H.B. 2 on the Ordinance and other city laws \nor policies.  The memorandum noted that H.B. 2 “invalidates . . . the February 22 \namendments to the public accommodations ordinance,” and concluded that “[d]ue to the \npreemption described above, the Community Relations Committee can no longer receive, \ninvestigate, and conciliate complaints for violations of the public accommodations \nordinance.”  The memorandum also expressed uncertainty regarding whether H.B. 2 \npreempted the city’s non-discrimination protections for city employees. \n160.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, Defendant Spellings issued a \nmemorandum dated April 5, 2016 to chancellors of constituent UNC schools, including \nUNC-Chapel Hill, UNC-Greensboro, and UNCSA-HS.  The memorandum specifically \nstates that “University institutions must require every multiple-occupancy bathroom and \nchanging facility to be designated for and used only by persons based on their biological \nsex.”  The memorandum included a copy of H.B. 2, which includes its definition of \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 38 of 58\n\n \n“biological sex.”  The same memo directed constituent schools to “fully meet their \nobligations under the Act.”  The following week, Defendant Spellings issued public \ncomments providing unequivocal guidance that “the University is bound to comply with \nHB2.”  On May 9, 2016, on the University of North Carolina’s behalf, Defendant \nSpellings further stated to representatives of the United States Department of Justice that \n“[H.B. 2] remains the law of the State . . . and the University has no independent power \nto change that legal reality.” \n161.  Following the enactment of H.B. 2, Governor McCrory issued Executive \nOrder No. 93, dated April 12, 2016.  The order affirmed that “[u]nder current law, every \nmultiple occupancy restroom, locker room, or shower facility located in a cabinet agency \nmust be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex,” and that \n“restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities in public buildings, including our \nschools” would be maintained by the State “on the basis of biological sex.”  In a press \nrelease and video statement accompanying Executive Order No. 93, the governor stated \nthat the Executive Order “[m]aintains . . . gender-specific restroom and locker room \nfacilities in government buildings and schools.”  \n162.  Executive Order No. 93 required that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-760 (H.B. 2, \nSection 1.3) be interpreted consistent with the following guidance: “[w]hen a private \nentity leases State real property and the property in the lessee’s exclusive possession \nincludes multiple occupancy restrooms, locker rooms or other like facilities, the private \nentity will control the signage and use of these facilities.”   \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 39 of 58\n\n \n163.  Executive Order No. 93 also sought to clarify the ambiguity regarding the \nscope of preemption provision noted by the City Attorney of the City of Charlotte, stating \nthat “N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-422.2(c) permits local governments or other political \nsubdivisions of the State to set their own employment policies applicable to their own \npersonnel,” and affirming that “local governments may establish their own non-\ndiscrimination employment practices.” \n164.  H.B. 2’s restroom ban also deters transgender people from participating in \nthe state and local democratic process.  It bans them from using the restroom consistent \nwith their gender identity when visiting the North Carolina General Assembly, \npetitioning their legislator, or entering any building operated by the legislative branch.  It \nalso bans them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity at a city \ncouncil meeting or at a mayor’s office. \n165.  H.B. 2’s harms extend even farther, creating conflicts between state law \nand various federal laws.  The conflict with Title IX, for example, puts at risk the more \nthan $4.5 billion in federal education funding that North Carolina is expected to receive \nin 2016.  H.B. 2 also could lead to financial penalties under Executive Order 11246, \nwhich prohibits federal contractors (such as the University of North Carolina) from \nbarring transgender employees from the restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  \nIn addition, public employers subject to Title VII will violate the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission’s decree that discriminating against transgender people with \nrespect to restroom use is impermissible sex discrimination.  Public hospitals that receive \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 40 of 58\n\n \nfederal funding also will violate Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act if they comply \nwith H.B. 2.   \n166.  The enactment of H.B. 2 follows a history of discrimination by decision-\nmakers against transgender people, including, for example, Governor McCrory’s \nparticipation in a Fourth Circuit amicus curiae brief arguing that a transgender student’s \nrequest to access restrooms in accordance with his gender identity is “radical.”   \nE.  H.B. 2 Harms Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals, as well as \nTransgender Individuals. \n \n167.  H.B. 2 also disproportionately burdens lesbian, gay, and bisexual \nindividuals, as well as transgender individuals, by stripping them of or barring them from \nanti-discrimination projections under local law.  H.B. 2 took aim at the Charlotte \nordinance in a section providing,    \nThe General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in \nemployment is properly an issue of general, statewide concern, such that this \nArticle and other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and \npreempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a \nunit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or \nimposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of \ndiscriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to \npersonnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law. \n \n168.  H.B. 2 stripped lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals of anti-discrimination \nprotections in Charlotte, because no such sexual orientation anti-discrimination \nprotections exist in state law.  The preemptive effect of this section did not fall equally on \nall North Carolinians, however.    \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 41 of 58\n\n \n169.  Recognizing that North Carolina law had no statewide public \naccommodations protection of any kind except for people with disabilities, H.B. 2 \nactually enacted a new public accommodations statute—so that the other groups whose \nprotections also would have been preempted under the Charlotte Ordinance were spared \nthat result.  The new public accommodations statute prohibits discrimination based on \n“race, religion, color, national origin, or biological sex”—omitting the sexual orientation \nprotections that had been included in the Charlotte Ordinance. \n170.  The North Carolina legislature has a history of targeted discrimination \ntoward lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.  For example, the legislature approved and \nreferred to voters a constitutional amendment barring access to marriage for same-sex \ncouples.  Legislative leaders also intervened in litigation challenging the constitutionality \nof the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage pursuant to a statute authorizing \nthem to act on behalf of the General Assembly.  In 2015, the legislature also passed a bill \nthat allows county magistrates to recuse themselves from performing civil marriages.  \n171.  The preemptive effect of H.B. 2 also harmed transgender people.  While the \nCharlotte Ordinance had prohibited discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and \ngender expression, the new public accommodations statute restricted its protections \nsolely to “biological sex,” which is defined in an effort to deliberately exclude \ntransgender people from protection.  \n42 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 42 of 58\n\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \n172.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 171 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n173.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants in their official \ncapacities for purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenge H.B. 2 \nboth facially and as applied to them. \n174.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \nA.  Discrimination Based on Sex and Transgender Status in Single-Sex \nRestrooms and Facilities (H.B. 2, Part I) \n \n175.  Section A of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and \nACLU of NC against Defendants Governor McCrory and Spellings. \n176.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n177.  H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex. \n43 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 43 of 58\n\n \n178.  Discrimination based on sex includes, but is not limited to, discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition.   \n179.  H.B. 2 facially classifies people based on sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status. \n180.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on transgender status is presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto heightened scrutiny. \n181.  H.B. 2 treats transgender people differently than non-transgender people \nwho are similarly situated.   \n182.  Under H.B. 2, non-transgender people are able to access restrooms and \nother single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity, but transgender people are \nbanned from restrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n183.  H.B. 2 discriminates against transgender people based on gender \nnonconformity.  For example, although Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry are men, are \nperceived as men in public, and have had medical treatment to bring their body into \nalignment with their male gender identity, they have birth certificates with female gender \nmarkers that do not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for men.  Furthermore, if \ntransgender men such as Mr. Carcaño and Mr. McGarry had been assigned male at birth, \nthey would not be banned by H.B. 2 from the restrooms and other single-sex facilities \n44 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 44 of 58\n\n \nconsistent with their gender identity.  The same is true for H.S., who is a young woman, \nis perceived as a woman in public, and has had medical treatment to bring her body into \nalignment with her gender but has a birth certificate that classifies her as male and \ntherefore does not conform to H.B. 2’s expectations for women.  Had H.S. been assigned \nfemale at birth, she would not be banned by H.B. 2 from restrooms and other single-sex \nfacilities designated for women and girls.  \n184.  No person has any control over the sex that person is assigned at birth.  In \nfact, when a person is born with characteristics associated with both male and female \ninfants, the appropriate course is to assign sex based on likely gender identity and to later \nre-assign sex based on gender identity once it is known if it conflicts with the original sex \nassignment.   \n185.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex or \ntransgender status is not substantially related to any important government interest.  \nIndeed, it is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n186.  H.B. 2 endangers the safety, privacy, security, and well-being of \ntransgender individuals.  For example, if a transgender young woman, like H.S., were to \nuse the restroom designated for men and boys, she likely would be harassed and might be \nassaulted by men or boys who believed that she should not be in that restroom.  Similarly, \nif a transgender man were to use the women’s restroom, he likely would be harassed and \nmight be assaulted by women who believe he should not be in the women’s restroom. \n45 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 45 of 58\n\n \n187.  H.B. 2 does not promote the safety, privacy, security, or well-being of non-\ntransgender people. \n188.  H.B. 2 deprives transgender people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, \nand autonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n189.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex denies \nthem the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nB.   Discrimination Based on Sex, Transgender Status, and Sexual \nOrientation in Preemption of Local Non-Discrimination Protections \n(H.B. 2, Part II, Sections 2.2 & 2.3; H.B. 2, Part III) \n \n190.  Section B of Count I is asserted by Plaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., \nGilmore, and ACLU of NC against Defendant Governor McCrory.   \n191.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \ndiscrimination based on sex, discrimination based on sexual orientation, and \ndiscrimination based on transgender status are presumptively unconstitutional and subject \nto heightened scrutiny. \n192.  H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of protections against discrimination based \non sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. \n193.  H.B. 2 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and \nworse, than other people, including by stripping them of the protections afforded by the \nCity of Charlotte’s Ordinance and precluding any local government from taking action to \nprotect LGBT people against discrimination.   \n46 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 46 of 58\n\n \n194.  H.B. 2 was enacted for the purpose of disadvantaging LGBT people and is \nbased on animus against LGBT people.  H.B. 2 was also enacted because of, and not in \nspite of, its adverse effects on LGBT people. \n195.  The justifications cited in H.B. 2 for its enactment, including a purported \ngovernmental interest in consistent statewide obligations, are pretext for discrimination \nand did not reflect the actual motivations for the bill.  For example, proposals to add \nsexual orientation and gender identity and expression protections to the statewide public \naccommodations law were rejected. \n196.  By blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people at the local \nlevel, H.B. 2 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT people \nthan on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based \ndiscrimination.  H.B. 2 accordingly places a special burden on LGBT people within the \ngovernmental process with an intent to injure that minority group.   \n197.  H.B. 2 deprives LGBT people of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and \nautonomy by branding them as second-class citizens. \n198.  H.B. 2’s discrimination against LGBT people based on sex and sexual \norientation denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n47 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 47 of 58\n\n \nC.  Discrimination Based on Transgender Status Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n199.  Transgender people have suffered a long history of extreme discrimination \nin North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such discrimination to \nthis day. \n200.  Transgender people are a discrete and insular group and lack the political \npower to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Transgender people have \nlargely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal protections to protect them \nagainst discrimination.  \n201.  A person’s gender identity or transgender status bears no relation to a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society. \n202.  Gender identity is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n203.  Gender identity generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \nD.  Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Warrants Heightened \nScrutiny. \n \n204.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people have suffered a long history of extreme \ndiscrimination in North Carolina and across the country, and continue to suffer such \ndiscrimination to this day. \n48 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 48 of 58\n\n \n205.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are a discrete and insular group and lack \nthe political power to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Lesbian, gay, \nand bisexual people have largely been unable to secure explicit local, state, and federal \nprotections to protect them against discrimination. \n206.  A person’s sexual orientation bears no relation to a person’s ability to \ncontribute to society. \n207.  Sexual orientation is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of \nequal treatment. \n208.  Sexual orientation generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to \nchange through intervention. \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of Right to Privacy \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Governor McCrory and Spellings \n \n209.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 208 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n210.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations \non state action that deprives individuals of life, liberty, or property.  \n211.  Substantive protections of the Due Process Clause include the right to avoid \ndisclosure of sensitive, personal information.   \n49 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 49 of 58\n\n \n212.  There is a fundamental right of privacy in preventing the release of, and in \ndeciding in what circumstances to release: (1) personal information of which the release \ncould subject them to bodily harm; and (2) information of a highly personal and intimate \nnature.  \n213.  H.B. 2 requires the disclosure of highly personal information regarding \ntransgender people to each person who sees them using a restroom or other facility \ninconsistent with their gender identity or gender expression.  This disclosure places them \nat risk of bodily harm.   \n214.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n215.  In addition, the privacy interests of transgender people that are invaded \noutweigh any purported interest the government could assert.  \n* * * \n \n \n \n \n   \n50 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 50 of 58\n\n \nCOUNT III \n \nViolation of Liberty and Autonomy in the \nRight to Refuse Unwanted Medical Treatment \n \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendants Governor McCrory and Spellings \n \n216.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 215 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n217.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals’ \nsubstantive rights to be free to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion. \n218.  The right to make certain private decisions without unjustified \ngovernmental intrusion includes the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n219.  H.B. 2 forces transgender people to undergo medical procedures that may \nnot be medically appropriate or available in order to access facilities consistent with their \ngender identity.  \n220.  Not all transgender individuals undergo gender confirmation surgery.  For \nsome, the surgery is not medically necessary, while for others it is medically dangerous \nor impossible.  For example, because medical treatment for gender dysphoria is \nindividualized, hormone treatment may be sufficient to manage the distress associated \nwith gender dysphoria for some individuals.  Surgery may be medically necessary for \n51 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 51 of 58\n\n \nothers who do not have health insurance coverage for it and cannot afford to pay for the \nsurgery out-of-pocket.  \n221.  Some states require proof of surgery before they will allow the gender \nmarker on a birth certificate to be changed.  For those born in North Carolina, state law \nrequires proof of “sex reassignment surgery.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 130A-11B.  \n222.  For example, H.S. has not been able to amend her New Jersey birth \ncertificate to accurately reflect her gender because surgery is not medically necessary for \nher and is generally not available to individuals under 18.  Accordingly, H.B. 2 bans her \nfrom accessing restrooms and other facilities consistent with her gender identity. \n223.  There is no compelling state interest that is furthered by H.B. 2, nor is \nH.B. 2 narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative for promoting a state interest.  \nH.B. 2 is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \nCOUNT IV \n \nViolation of Title IX \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \nPlaintiffs Carcaño, McGarry, H.S., and ACLU of NC \nagainst Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n224.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 223 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n225.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n52 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 52 of 58\n\n \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \n226.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination \non the basis of gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, and gender \ntransition. \n227.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \n228.  Defendant University of North Carolina is an executive branch agency as \ndefined by H.B. 2. \n229.  Pursuant to H.B. 2, Defendant University of North Carolina “shall require \nevery multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be designated for and only \nused by persons based on their biological sex.”  As set forth in Defendant Spellings’ \nmemorandum dated April 5, 2016, Defendant University of North Carolina has \nimplemented H.B. 2 by issuing guidance that “[u]niversity institutions must require every \nmultiple-occupancy bathroom and changing facility to be designated for and used only by \npersons based on their biological sex.” \n230.  By requiring Mr. Carcaño—a transgender man—to use restrooms and \nchanging facilities that are inconsistent with his gender identity, Defendant University of \nNorth Carolina excludes Mr. Carcaño from participation in, denies him the benefits of, \nand subjects him to discrimination in educational programs and activities at Defendant’s \nconstituent campus, UNC-Chapel Hill, “on the basis of sex,” which violates Mr. \n53 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 53 of 58\n\n \nCarcaño’s rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681, et seq. \n231.

By requiring H.S.—a transgender young woman—to use restrooms and \nchanging facilities that are inconsistent with her gender identity, Defendant University of \nNorth Carolina excludes H.S. from participation in, denies her the benefits of, and \nsubjects her to discrimination in educational programs and activities at Defendant’s \nconstituent campus, UNCSA-HS, “on the basis of sex,” which violates H.S.’s rights \nunder Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n233.  By requiring transgender members of the ACLU of NC, who attend school \nor work at constituent campuses of Defendant University of North Carolina, to use \nrestrooms and changing facilities inconsistent with their gender identity, Defendant \nUniversity of North Carolina excludes transgender members of the ACLU of NC from \nparticipation in, denies them the benefits of, and subjects them to discrimination in \neducational programs and activities “on the basis of sex,” which violates ACLU of NC \n54 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 183   Filed 11/21/16   Page 54 of 58\n\n \nmembers’ rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, \net seq. \nCOUNT V \n \nViolation of Title VII \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. \n \nPlaintiff Carcaño \nagainst Defendant University of North Carolina \n \n234.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 233 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n235.  Defendant UNC has engaged in sex discrimination against Mr. Carcaño in \nviolation of Title VII.  Defendant UNC has denied him access to restrooms and changing \nfacilities consistent with his gender identity, which is a term, condition, and privilege of \nemployment.  This denial also limits, segregates, or classifies him in a way that deprives \nor tends to deprive him of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his \nstatus as an employee.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:   \nA.

Whereas on March 28, 2016, Plaintiffs Joaquín Carcaño, Payton Grey  \nMcGarry,  Angela  Gilmore,  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  North  Carolina \n(“ACLU-NC”), and Equality North Carolina filed a complaint challenging House Bill 2  \n(Session Law 2016-3, hereafter referred to as “H.B. 2”) and seeking relief from Defendants \nPatrick McCrory, in his official capacity as Governor of North Carolina; Roy A. Cooper \nIII, in his official capacity as Attorney General of North Carolina; the University of North \nCarolina; the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina; and W. Louis \nBissette,  Jr.,  in  his  official  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the \nUniversity of North Carolina.    \n2.  Whereas Phil Berger, in his official capacity as President Pro Tempore of the \nNorth Carolina Senate; and Tim Moore, in his official capacity as Speaker of the North \n1 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 296   Filed 07/23/19   Page 1 of 9\n\nCarolina House of Representatives, sought and were granted permissive intervention in this \naction on June 6, 2016.  \n3.  Whereas Roy A. Cooper, III took office as Governor of North Carolina on \nJanuary 1, 2017, and was automatically substituted as a defendant for Governor McCrory \nin his official capacity as Governor of North Carolina pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 25(d).    \n4.  Whereas on March 30, 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted, \nand Governor Cooper signed, House Bill 142, codified as Session Law 2017-4 (“H.B. \n142”).  H.B. 142, incorporated herein as “Exhibit A,” rescinded H.B. 2’s provisions \nlimiting transgender individuals’ use of public facilities.  The term “public facilities” as \nused throughout this Consent Decree refers to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or \nchanging facilities as referenced in N.C.G.S. § 143-760 and sect. 2 of H.B. 142.   \n5.  Whereas  on  July  21,  2017,  Plaintiffs  Joaquín  Carcaño,  Payton  Grey \nMcGarry,  Hunter  Schafer,  Madeline  Goss,  Angela  Gilmore,  Quinton  Harper,  and \nACLUNC (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Fourth Amended Complaint challenging Sections 2, 3, and \n4 of H.B. 142 and seeking relief from Defendants Roy A. Cooper, III, in his official \ncapacity as Governor of North Carolina; the University of North Carolina; Margaret \nSpellings, in her official capacity as President of the University of North Carolina; Josh \nStein, in his official capacity as Attorney General of North Carolina; Machelle Sanders, in \nher official capacity as Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Administration; \nMandy K. Cohen, in her official capacity as Secretary of the North Carolina Department \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 296   Filed 07/23/19   Page 2 of 9\n\nof Health and Human Services; and, James H. Trogdon III, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.    \n6.  Whereas  Governor  Cooper,  Attorney  General  Stein,  Secretary  Sanders, \nSecretary Cohen, and Secretary Trogdon (“Executive Branch Defendants”) believe that \ncontinued litigation over the meaning and enforcement of H.B. 142 will result in the \nunnecessary expenditure of State resources, and is contrary to the best interests of the State \nof North Carolina.   \n7.  Whereas Executive Branch Defendants do not waive any protections offered \nto them through federal or state law, and do not make any representation regarding the \nmerits of Plaintiffs’ claims or potential defenses which could be raised in court.   \n8.  Whereas  Plaintiffs  and  the  Executive  Branch  Defendants  (collectively \nreferred to as “the Consent Parties”) believe that a resolution of the matter at this time and \nin the manner encompassed by the terms of this Consent Decree serves the best interests of \nthe State and its citizens.    \n9.  Whereas  the  Consent  Parties  agree  that  this  Consent  Decree  promotes \njudicial economy, protects the limited resources of the Consent Parties, and resolves \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the Executive Branch Defendants.    \n10.  Whereas  the  Consent  Parties  further  agree  that  any  interpretation  or \napplication of Section 2 of H.B. 142 that bars, prohibits, blocks, deters, or impedes \ntransgender people from using public facilities in accordance with their gender identity or \nsubjects transgender people to arrest, prosecution, or criminal sanctions for doing so, raises \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 296   Filed 07/23/19   Page 3 of 9\n\nserious federal-law concerns, including concerns over constitutional guarantees of equal \nprotection and due process, as well as other applicable federal statutes.      \n11.  Whereas the Court held that “Nothing in the language of Section 2 can be \nconstrued to prevent transgender individuals from using the restrooms that align with their \ngender identity[.]” ECF 248 at 49.  \n12.  Whereas the Consent Parties wish to record the interpretation of H.B. 142 set \nforth in this Consent Decree, and thereby effect a binding and enforceable resolution of the \nclaims by Plaintiffs against the Executive Branch Defendants with respect to H.B. 142.  \n13.  Whereas the Consent Parties therefore consent to entry of the following final \nand binding judgment as dispositive of all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the Executive \nBranch Defendants with respect to H.B. 142.  \n14.  Whereas Plaintiffs agree to a waiver of any entitlement to damages, fees, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs against the Executive Branch Defendants, \nwith respect to any and all claims raised by Plaintiffs in this action.     \n15.  Whereas Plaintiffs further agree that dismissal of any and all remaining \nclaims stemming from H.B. 2 and H.B. 142, against the Executive Branch Defendants is \nappropriate, and therefore request a dismissal of all remaining claims against the Executive \nBranch Defendants with prejudice following the formal approval of the Consent Decree by \nthe presiding District Judge.    \n16.  Whereas the Consent Parties intend the following Consent Decree to clarify \nthat nothing in H.B. 142 can be construed to prevent any person from lawfully using a \npublic facility under Executive Branch control that accords with such person’s gender \n4 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 296   Filed 07/23/19   Page 4 of 9\n\nidentity, and to be binding for purposes of issue preclusion and claim preclusion in all \nfuture actions, including through non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel.  \nACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND \nDECREED THAT:  \n1.  With  respect  to  public  facilities  that  are  subject  to  Executive  Branch \nDefendants’ control or supervision, the Consent Parties agree that nothing in Section 2 of \nH.B. 142 can be construed by the Executive Branch Defendants to prevent transgender \npeople from lawfully using public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.  The \nExecutive Branch Defendants as used in this paragraph shall include their successors, \nofficers, and employees.  This Order does not preclude any of the Parties from challenging \nor acting in accordance with future legislation.  \n2.  The  Executive  Branch  Defendants,  in  their  official  capacities,  and  all \nsuccessors,  officers,  and  employees  are  hereby  permanently  enjoined  from  applying \nSection 2 of H.B. 142 to bar, prohibit, block, deter, or impede any transgender individuals \nfrom  using  public  facilities  under  any  Executive  Branch  Defendant’s  control  or \nsupervision, in accordance with the transgender individual’s gender identity.  Under the \nauthority  granted  by  the  General  Statutes  existing  as  of  December  21,  2018,  and \nnotwithstanding N.C.G.S. § 114-11.6, the Executive Branch Defendants are enjoined from \nprosecuting an individual under Section 2 of H.B. 142 for using public facilities under the \ncontrol or supervision of the Executive Branch, when such otherwise lawful use conforms \nwith the individual’s gender identity.    \n3.  The Consent Parties shall each bear their own fees, expenses, and costs with \n5 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 296   Filed 07/23/19   Page 5 of 9\n\nrespect to all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the Executive Branch Defendants.  \n4.  All  remaining  claims  filed  by  Plaintiffs  against  the  Executive  Branch \nDefendants in this action are hereby dismissed with prejudice.   \n \n            /s/ Thomas D.

SCHROEDER, District Judge. \nThis  case  is  one  of  three  related  actions  in  this  court \nconcerning North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy & Security \nAct,  2016  N.C.  Sess.  Laws  3,  commonly  known  as  House  Bill  2 \n(“HB2”).  Although Plaintiffs challenge multiple portions of HB2, \nthey presently seek preliminary relief only as to Part I, the so-\ncalled “bathroom bill” portion of the law, which requires public \nagencies to ensure that multiple occupancy bathrooms, showers, and \nother similar facilities are “designated for and only used by” \n \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 1 of 83\n\npersons based on their “biological sex,” defined as the sex listed \non their birth certificate.  2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 3 §§ 1.2–1.3.  \nPlaintiffs  include  two  transgender1  students  and  one  employee \n(collectively,  the  “individual  transgender  Plaintiffs”)  of  the \nUniversity of North Carolina (“UNC”), as well as the American Civil \nLiberties Union of North Carolina (“ACLU-NC”), which sues on behalf \nof its transgender members.  (Doc. 9 ¶¶ 5–7, 10.)  The individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs (in their individual capacities) claim that \nPart I violates Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C.  § 1681  et  seq.  (“Title  IX”).    (Doc.  9  ¶¶ 235–43.)    In \naddition, the individual transgender Plaintiffs and ACLU-NC claim \nthat Part I violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses \nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.2  \n                     \n1 Transgender individuals are persons who do not identify with their \nbirth  sex,  which  is  typically  determined  on  the  basis  of  external \ngenitalia.  (Doc. 22-1 ¶¶ 12, 14; see also Doc. 9 ¶ 26.)  According to \nthe latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, some transgender individuals \nsuffer from a condition called gender dysphoria, which occurs when the \n“marked  incongruence  between  one’s  experienced/expressed  gender  and \nassigned gender” is associated with “clinically significant distress or \nimpairment  in  social,  occupational,  or  other  important  areas  of \nfunctioning.”  (Doc. 22-5 ¶¶ 12–13.)  In other words, gender dysphoria \noccurs when transgender individuals experience emotional, psychological, \nor social distress because “their deeply felt, core identification and \nself-image as a particular gender does not align” with their birth sex.  \n(See Doc. 22-1 ¶ 19.)  For purposes of the present motion, the court \naccepts  Plaintiffs’  unrebutted  evidence  that  some  transgender \nindividuals form their gender identity misalignment at a young age and \nexhibit distinct “brain structure, connectivity, and function” that does \nnot match their birth sex.  (Id. ¶¶ 18, 22.) \n \n2 After the preliminary injunction hearing, ACLU-NC moved to file a \nsecond amended complaint to allege a Title IX representational claim.  \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 2 of 83\n\n(Id. ¶¶ 186–200, 220–34.)  \nIt is important to note what is (and is not) in dispute.  All \nparties agree that sex-segregated bathrooms, showers, and changing \nfacilities promote important State privacy interests, and neither \nPlaintiffs nor the United States contests the convention.  Further, \nno  party  has  indicated  that  the  pre-HB2  legal  regime  posed  a \nsignificant privacy or safety threat to anyone in North Carolina, \ntransgender  or  otherwise.    The  parties  do  have  different \nconceptions, of how North Carolina law generally operated before \nMarch 2016, however, and whether “sex” includes gender identity.   \n Plaintiffs contend that time is of the essence, as HB2’s \nimpact will be most felt as educational institutions across the \nState begin a new academic  year.  As a result, the  court  has \nendeavored to resolve Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary relief as \nquickly as possible. \nUltimately,  the  record  reflects  what  counsel  for  Governor \nMcCrory  candidly  speculates  was  the  status  quo  ante  in  North \nCarolina in recent years: some transgender individuals have been \nquietly  using  bathrooms  and  other  facilities  that  match  their \ngender identity, without public awareness or incident.  (See Doc. \n103 at 70 (speculating that, even if Part I remains in force, “some \n                     \n(Doc. 116.)  Briefing on that motion is incomplete, so the court only \nconsiders Title IX relief for the individual transgender Plaintiffs at \nthis time.   \n \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 3 of 83\n\ntransgender individuals will continue to use the bathroom that \nthey always used and nobody will know.”).)  This appears to have \noccurred  in  part  because  of  two  factors.    First,  the  record \nsuggests  that,  for  obvious  reasons,  transgender  individuals \ngenerally seek to avoid having their nude or partially nude bodies \nexposed in bathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities.  (See \nDoc.  103  at  140.)    Second,  North  Carolina’s  decades-old  laws \nagainst  indecent  exposure,  peeping,  and  trespass  protected  the \nlegitimate and significant State interests of privacy and safety.     \nAfter careful consideration of the limited record presented \nthus far,3 the court concludes  that  the individual transgender \nPlaintiffs have made a clear showing that (1) they are likely to \nsucceed  on  their  claim  that  Part  I  violates  Title  IX,  as \ninterpreted by the United States Department of Education (“DOE”) \nunder the standard articulated by the Fourth Circuit; (2) they \nwill suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(3) the balance of equities weighs in favor of an injunction; and \n                     \n3 In response to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, Governor \nMcCrory, Senator Burger, and Representative Moore requested a several-\nmonth delay.  (Doc. 53 at 9–11; Doc. 61 at 27–29.)  These Defendants \nclaimed the need for extensive factual discovery to adequately address \nthe issues presented in Plaintiffs’ motion.  (Id.)  They collectively \nsubmitted only six exhibits, however, each of which consists of a short \nnews article or editorial.  (See Docs. 55-1 through 55-6.)  Moreover, \nduring a scheduling conference held on July 1, 2016, they indicated that \nthey did not intend to offer additional exhibits or live testimony and \nthat  any  preliminary  injunction  hearing  could  be  limited  to  oral \nargument.  As a result, nearly the entire factual record in this case \nis derived from materials submitted by Plaintiffs. \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 4 of 83\n\n(4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Accordingly, the \ncourt will enjoin UNC from enforcing Part I against the individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs until the court reaches a final decision on \nthe merits in this case.  Plaintiffs have not made a clear showing \nthey are likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim, and \nthe court will reserve ruling on their Due Process claims pending \nadditional briefing from the parties.   \nIt is important to emphasize that this injunction returns the \nparties to the status quo ante as it existed in Title IX facilities \nprior to Part I’s passage in March 2016.  On the current record, \nthere is no reason to believe that a return to the status quo ante \npending a trial on the merits will compromise the important State \ninterests asserted.   \n \nI. BACKGROUND \nBased on the record thus far, the court makes the following \nfindings for the limited purpose of evaluating Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor preliminary injunction. \n \nA. North Carolina Law Before 2016 \nLike most States, North Carolina has long enforced a variety \nof public decency laws designed to protect citizens from exposing \ntheir nude or partially nude bodies in the presence of members of \nthe opposite sex, as well as from being exposed to the nude or \npartially nude bodies of members of the opposite sex.  With regard \nto the former, North Carolina’s peeping statute, enacted in 1957, \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 5 of 83\n\nmakes it unlawful for any person to “peep secretly into any room \noccupied  by  another  person,”  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 14-202(a), \nincluding a bathroom or shower, and penalties are enhanced if the \noffender does so for the purpose of sexual gratification, id. § 14-\n202(d).    With  regard  to  the  latter,  North  Carolina’s  indecent \nexposure statute, enacted in 1971, makes it unlawful for any person \nto “willfully expose the private parts of his or her person in any \npublic place and in the presence of any other person or persons.”  \nId. § 14-190.9(a).  Traditionally, the indecent exposure statute \napplied only to individuals who exposed themselves to members of \nthe opposite sex.  See State v. Fusco, 136 N.C. App. 268, 270, 523 \nS.E.2d 741, 742 (1999) (interpreting an earlier version of § 14-\n190.9(a)).  In 2005, North Carolina removed the language that had \npreviously  limited  the  statute’s  application  to  situations  in \nwhich individuals exposed themselves in the presence of members of \nthe opposite sex.  2005 N.C. Sess. Laws 226 § 1 (modifying N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 14-190.9).  That same amendment, however, created an \nexception for situations in which “same sex exposure” occurs in a \n“place[] designated for a public purpose” and is “incidental to a \npermitted activity.”  Id.   \nIn  addition  to  these  statutes,  public  agencies  in  North \nCarolina have also traditionally protected privacy through the use \nof sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and similar \nfacilities.  Although this form of sex discrimination has a long \n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 6 of 83\n\nhistory in the State and elsewhere, the parties offer differing \nideas  of  the  justification  for  the  practice.    Plaintiffs \nacknowledge, as Defendants contend, that such segregation promotes \nprivacy and serves important government interests, particularly \nwith regard to minors.  (See, e.g., Doc. 103 at 15–21.)  Arguably, \nsegregating such facilities on the basis of sex fills gaps not \naddressed  by  the  peeping  and  indecent  exposure  statutes  –  for \nexample, a situation in which a man might inadvertently expose \nhimself to another while using a facility that is not partitioned.  \nIt is also possible that sex-segregated facilities protect against \nembarrassment from engaging in intimate bodily functions in the \nimmediate vicinity of the opposite sex, regardless of whether one’s \nbody is subject to view. \nWhatever  the  justification,  the  segregation  of  these \nfacilities  has  traditionally  been  enforced  through  voluntary \ncompliance,  social  mores,  and,  when  necessary,  criminal \ntrespassing law.  See In re S.M.S., 196 N.C. App. 170, 675 S.E.2d \n44 (2009).  For example, in S.M.S., a fifteen year old boy was \nadjudicated  delinquent  of  second  degree  trespass  after  he  was \ncaught in the girls’ locker room at his high school.  Id. at 170–\n71, 675 S.E.2d at 44–45.  Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-159.13, \nit is a second degree trespass to enter the premises of another \nwhen reasonably conspicuous signs are posted to give the intruder \n“notice  not  to  enter  the  premises.”    In  upholding  the  boy’s \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 7 of 83\n\nconviction, the North Carolina Court of Appeals concluded, “The \nsign marked ‘Girl’s Locker Room’ was reasonably likely to give \nrespondent notice that he was not authorized to go into the girls’ \nlocker room.”  S.M.S., 196 N.C. App. at 173, 675 S.E.2d at 46. \nFor most, the application of the peeping, indecent exposure, \nand  trespass  laws  to  sex-segregated  bathrooms  and  showers  is \nstraightforward  and  uncontroversial.    For  transgender  users, \nhowever, it is not clearly so.  While there are no reported cases \ninvolving transgender users, at the preliminary injunction hearing \nGovernor  McCrory,  Senator  Berger,  and  Representative  Moore \nindicated their assumption that this was so because transgender \nusers have traditionally been excluded (or excluded themselves) \nfrom facilities that correspond with their gender identity.  The \nevidence in the current record, however, suggests the opposite.  \nAt least in more recent years, transgender individuals who dress \nand otherwise present themselves in accordance with their gender \nidentity have generally been accommodated on a case-by-case basis, \nwith  educational  institutions  generally  permitting  them  to  use \nbathrooms and other facilities that correspond with their gender \nidentity unless particular circumstances weigh in favor of some \nother form of accommodation.  \nFor example, Plaintiffs submitted an affidavit from Monica \nWalker,  the  Diversity  Officer  for  public  schools  in  Guilford \nCounty, North Carolina, the State’s third largest school district, \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 8 of 83\n\nwith over 72,000 students in 127 school campuses.  (Doc. 22-19 \n¶¶ 2–3.)  Over the last five years, Ms. Walker has developed a \nprotocol for accommodating transgender students as they undergo \nthe social transition from male to female, or vice versa.  (Id. \n¶¶ 8–11.)  This protocol emphasizes the importance of developing \na “tailored” plan that addresses the unique needs and circumstances \nof each case.  (See id. ¶ 11.)  Based on her experience with four \ntransgender  students,  Ms.  Walker  indicates  that  these  students \ntypically  use  bathrooms  that  correspond  with  their  gender \nidentity.  (Id.)  Ms. Walker has not received any complaints about \nthis  arrangement  from  students  or  parents,  and  although  every \nschool in Guilford County has single occupancy bathrooms available \nfor  any  student  with  privacy  concerns,  no  student  has  ever \nrequested such an accommodation.  (Id. ¶¶ 13–16.)  This may be \nbecause  all  multiple  occupancy  bathrooms  in  Guilford  County \nschools  have  separate  stalls  or  privacy  partitions,  such  that \nstudents  are  not  exposed  to  nudity  in  bathrooms.    (See  id.)  \nAlthough  Ms.  Walker  has  yet  to  deal  with  questions  concerning \naccess to locker rooms, she is confident that the privacy interests \nof  transgender  and  non-transgender  students  alike  could  be \naccommodated through the same means used to accommodate any student \nwith body image or shyness issues.  (See id.)  In sum, Ms. Walker \nreports that the practice of tailoring specific accommodations for \ntransgender students on a case-by-case basis in Guilford County \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 9 of 83\n\nhas been “seamless.”  (Id. ¶ 12.)  And according to an amicus brief \nfiled  by  school  administrators  from  nineteen  States  plus  the \nDistrict of Columbia – including Durham County Schools in North \nCarolina,  another  large  school  district  –  Guilford  County’s \nexperience is typical of many school districts from across the \ncountry.  (See Doc. 71.)   \nThis conclusion is also consistent with the experiences of \nthe individual transgender Plaintiffs in this action.  All three \nsubmitted declarations stating that they used bathrooms, locker \nrooms,  and  even  dormitory  facilities  corresponding  with  their \ngender identity beginning as early as 2014.  (Doc. 22-4 ¶ 15; Doc. \n22-8  ¶ 19;  Doc.  22-9  ¶¶ 15,  19–20.)    No  one  has  reported  any \nincident or complaint from their classmates or the general public.  \n(See Doc. 22-4 ¶ 30; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 25; Doc. 22-9 ¶ 20.)    \nThis evidence is admittedly anecdotal.  It is possible that \nbefore Part I, some transgender individuals in North Carolina were \ndenied accommodations and completely excluded from facilities that \ncorrespond with their gender identity due to privacy or safety \nconcerns.    Also,  minors  may  have  received  different  types  of \naccommodations than adults, and practical considerations may have \nled to different arrangements for bathrooms as opposed to showers \nand other facilities.  And, it may be that the practice of case-\nby-case accommodation is a more recent phenomenon, such that other \nnorms prevailed for most of North Carolina’s history until the \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 10 of 83\n\nlast few years.  But Defendants have not offered any evidence \nwhatsoever on these points, despite having four months between the \nfiling of this lawsuit and the hearing on this motion to do so.  \nIndeed,  the  court  does  not  even  have  a  legislative  record \nsupporting the law to consider.4   \nAs a result, the court cannot say that the practices described \nby  Ms.  Walker,  the  school  administrators,  and  the  individual \ntransgender  Plaintiffs  represent  an  aberration  rather  than  the \nprevailing norm in North Carolina, at least for the five or more \nyear period leading up to 2016.  Rather, on the current record, it \nappears that some transgender individuals have been quietly using \nfacilities corresponding with their gender identity and that, in \nrecent  years,  State  educational  institutions  have  been \naccommodating such students where possible. \n \nB. The Charlotte Ordinance and the State’s Response \nIn  November  2014,  the  Charlotte  City  Council  began \nconsidering a proposal to modify that city’s non-discrimination \nordinances  to  prohibit  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  marital \nstatus, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and \n                     \n4 Defendants have since filed transcripts of the legislative record in \na separate case.  (Docs. 149-5 through 149-8 in case no. 1:16cv425.) \n \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 11 of 83\n\ngender expression.5  (Doc. 23-3 at 2.)6  On March 2, 2015, the \nproposed ordinance was amended to include the following language: \n“Notwithstanding the forgoing [sic], this section shall not, with \nregard to sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender \nexpression,  apply  to  rest  rooms,  locker  rooms,  showers,  and \nchanging facilities.”  (Id.)  Shortly thereafter, the proposed \nordinance failed by a vote of six to five.  (Id.)  \nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council considered \na new proposal to revise its non-discrimination ordinances.  (Doc. \n23-5 at 2–3.)  Like the prior proposal, the new proposal added \n“marital  status,  familial  status,  sexual  orientation,  gender \nidentity,  [and]  gender  expression”  to  the  list  of  protected \ncharacteristics.  (Doc. 23-2 at 1.)  Unlike the prior proposal, \nhowever,  the  new  proposal  did  not  contain  any  exceptions  for \nbathrooms, showers, or other similar facilities.  (See id. at 1–\n6.)    In  addition,  the  new  proposal  repealed  prior  rules  that \nexempted  “[r]estrooms,  shower  rooms,  bathhouses  and  similar \nfacilities  which  are  in  their  nature  distinctly  private”  from \nCharlotte’s prohibitions against sex discrimination.  (Id. at 5.)  \n                     \n5 Charlotte’s  existing  non-discrimination  ordinances  prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, \nethnicity, age, disability, and sex.  (See Doc. 23-2 at 1, 6.) \n \n6 Not all of the exhibits in the record contain internal page numbers, \nand  many  include  cover  pages  that  were  not  part  of  the  original \ndocuments.  For clarity, all record citations in this opinion refer to \nthe pagination in the CM/ECF version of the document. \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 12 of 83\n\nThe new proposal, which regulated places of public accommodation \nand businesses seeking to contract with Charlotte (id. at 2–6), \npassed by a vote of seven to four (Doc. 23-5 at 3)7 and set an \neffective date of April 1, 2016 (Doc. 23-2 at 6). \nThe Charlotte ordinance provoked a swift response from the \nState.    Governor  McCrory  and  several  members  of  the  General \nAssembly strongly condemned the ordinance, which they generally \ncharacterized as an affront to both privacy and public safety, and \nthey  indicated  their  desire  to  see  a  legislative  response  to \nCharlotte’s actions.  (See, e.g., Doc. 23-7 at 2; Doc. 23-8 at 2.)  \nThe General Assembly was not scheduled to reconvene until April \n25, 2016, however, and despite his opposition to the Charlotte \nordinance, Governor McCrory declined to exercise his authority to \ncall a special legislative session.  (See Doc. 23-16 at 2–3; Doc. \n23-18 at 4.)  As a result, the General Assembly only reconvened \nafter three-fifths of the members of the House of Representatives \nrequested a special session.  (Docs. 23-17 at 2.)8  \nOn  March  23,  2016,  the  General  Assembly  convened  for  the \nspecial session and moved quickly.  (See Doc. 23-19 at 2.)  The \nparties  have  offered  little  information  on  the  legislative \n                     \n7 All seven votes in favor of the ordinance were cast by Democrats, while \ntwo Democrats and two Republicans voted against the ordinance.  (See \nDoc. 23-5 at 4–8.)   \n \n8 The Governor may call special sessions of the General Assembly in \nresponse to unexpected or emergency situations.  (See Doc. 23-18 at 4.) \n \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 13 of 83\n\nprocess,  but  it  appears  that  members  of  the  House  Judiciary \nCommittee were given only a few minutes to read HB2 before voting \non whether to send the bill back to the House for a full debate.  \n(See id.)  That  afternoon, the  House passed  HB2 by a  vote of \neighty-four to twenty-five after three hours of debate.  (Doc. 23-\n21 at 3.)  All Republicans and eleven of the thirty-six Democrats \npresent  voted  for  the  bill,  while  twenty-five  Democrats  voted \nagainst it.  (Id.)  HB2 then passed with unanimous support in the \nSenate after Democrats walked out in protest.  (Id.)  Governor \nMcCrory signed the bill into law later that day.  (Id.)  The law \nbecame effective immediately.  HB2 § 5. \n \nC. HB2’s Effect on North Carolina Law \nDespite sweeping rhetoric from both supporters and opponents, \na few basic contours of HB2 are apparent.   \n \n1. Nondiscrimination Standards Under State Law \nFirst,  HB2  modified  the  State’s  nondiscrimination  laws.  \nPreviously, the State had prohibited discrimination on the basis \nof race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, and handicap.  \nSee id. §§ 3.1.  Part III of HB2 modified this language to prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of “biological sex,” rather than simply \n“sex.”  Id. (modifying N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-422.2).  It also \nextended these nondiscrimination protections, which had previously \napplied only to the State, to cover private employers and places \nof public accommodation.  See id. §§ 3.1-3.3.   \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 14 of 83\n\nPart III also eliminated State common-law causes of action \nfor  violations  of  non-discrimination  laws.    See  id.  § 3.2 \n(modifying N.C. Gen. Stat. 143-422.3).  This appeared to eliminate \nthe State cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of \npublic policy, although it did not prevent North Carolinians from \nfiling actions under federal non-discrimination laws, whether in \nState or federal court.  This provision has since been repealed.  \n2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 99 § 1(a).   \n \n2. Preemption of Local Ordinances \nParts II and III of HB2 preempt all local ordinances that \nconflict  with  the  new  Statewide  nondiscrimination  standards, \nincluding the Charlotte ordinance that prompted HB2’s passage.9  \nSpecifically,  Part  II  preempts  local  non-discrimination \nrequirements  for  public  contractors  to  the  extent  that  such \nrequirements conflict with State law.  HB2 §§ 2.1–2.3.  Similarly, \nPart III preempts local nondiscrimination ordinances for places of \npublic accommodation to the extent that such ordinances conflict \nwith  State  law.    Id.  §§ 3.3.    Collectively,  Parts  II  and  III \neffectively nullified the prohibitions in Charlotte’s ordinance \nagainst discrimination on the basis of marital status, familial \nstatus,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity,  and  gender \n                     \n9 Part II also preempted local minimum wage standards.  HB2 §§ 2.1–2.3.  \nThis portion of HB2 has not been challenged in these cases. \n \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 15 of 83\n\nexpression.10     \n \n3. Public Bathrooms and Changing Facilities \nAs discussed above, Parts II and III effectively nullified \nthe controversial portions of the Charlotte ordinance, including \nits regulation of bathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities \namong contractors and in places of public accommodation.  Part I \ngoes a step further, however, explicitly setting rules for the use \nof similar facilities operated by State agencies. \nPart I provides that all public agencies, including local \nboards of public education, shall “require” that every “multiple \noccupancy bathroom or changing facility”11 be “designated for and \nonly used by persons based on their biological sex.”12  Id. §§ 1.2–\n1.3.  Part I defines “biological sex” as “[t]he physical condition \nof  being  male  or  female,  which  is  stated  on  a  person’s  birth \ncertificate.”13  Id.  Although Part I allows public agencies to \n                     \n10  These  are  apart  from  the  law’s effect,  if  any,  on  the  Charlotte \nordinance’s protections against discrimination on the basis of “gender,” \n“ethnicity,” and “handicap.”   \n  \n11  The  statute  defines  a  “multiple  occupancy  bathroom  or  changing \nfacility” as a “facility designed or designated to be used by more than \none person at a time where [persons] may be in various states of undress \nin the presence of other persons.  A multiple occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility may include, but is not limited to, a [restroom], \nlocker room, changing room, or shower room.”  Id. §§ 1.2-1.3. \n \n12 This rule is subject to various exceptions that are not pertinent \nhere.    For  example,  Part  I  does  not  apply  when  individuals  enter \nbathrooms for custodial or maintenance purposes, or to assist other \nindividuals in using the facility.  See id. §§ 1.2–1.3. \n \n13 Notwithstanding the reference to “the physical condition of being male \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 16 of 83\n\nprovide separate, single occupancy facilities as an accommodation \nfor  individuals  who  are  uncomfortable  with  their  assigned \nfacility, the law does not require the option.  See id. (stating \nthat public agencies may provide “accommodations such as single \noccupancy bathroom or changing facilities upon a person’s request \ndue to special circumstances” (emphasis added)).  In addition, \nPart  I  prohibits  agencies  from  accommodating  individuals  by \npermitting them to access multiple occupancy facilities that do \nnot match the sex listed on their birth certificates.  Id.  (“[I]n \nno event shall [any] accommodation result in the public agency \nallowing a person to use a multiple occupancy bathroom or changing \nfacility  designated  . . .  for  a  sex  other  than  the  person’s \nbiological sex.”).  Because the law is limited to State agencies, \nthere  is  no  dispute  that  private  businesses,  places  of  public \naccommodation, and other persons throughout the State remain free \nto define “sex” and regulate bathroom and other facility usage as \n                     \nor female,” all parties agree that the law defines “biological sex” as \nthe sex listed on the individuals’ current birth certificate.  (See Doc. \n22 at 6 (Plaintiffs, stating that Part I restricts access to facilities \n“based on the gender marker on one’s birth certificate”); Doc. 50 at 15 \n(UNC,  stating  that  Part  I  requires  individuals  to  use  bathrooms \ncorresponding  with  their  “biological  sex,  as  listed  on  their  birth \ncertificates”); Doc. 55 at 1 (Governor McCrory, stating that Part I \n“notes  that  [‘biological  sex’]  is  ‘stated  on  a  person’s  birth \ncertificate’”); Doc. 61 at 6 (Senator Berger and Representative Moore: \n“HB2  determines  biological  sex  based  on  the  person’s  current  birth \ncertificate.”).)  Notably,  the  law’s  reliance  on  birth  certificates \nnecessarily contemplates that transgender individuals may use facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity - notwithstanding their birth sex \nand regardless of whether they have had gender reassignment surgery - \nas long as their current birth certificate has been changed to reflect \ntheir gender identity, a practice permitted in some States. \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 17 of 83\n\nthey please, subject to other applicable law.  \nAt the hearing for this motion, the parties offered differing \ninterpretations of how Part I affects North Carolina law.  As \ndiscussed below, UNC argues that, at least on its campuses, Part \nI means only that public authorities must maintain signs on their \nmultiple occupancy bathrooms designated “men” or “women.”  Senator \nBerger and Representative Moore suggested that Part I functions as \n“a  directive”  to  public  agencies  that  they  must  “implement \npolicies” on bathroom use.  (Doc. 103 at 112.)  Ultimately, the \nUnited States, Senator Berger, and Representative Moore all agree \nthat, at a minimum, Part I dictates how the trespassing statute \napplies to transgender individuals’ use of bathrooms.   \nBefore Part I became law, North Carolina had no prohibition \nagainst public agencies determining on a case-by-case basis how \nbest  to  accommodate  transgender  individuals  who  wished  to  use \nparticular bathrooms, showers, or other similar facilities.  In \naddition, transgender individuals who used facilities that did not \nmatch the sex listed on their birth certificate could presumably \nargue that they believed they had permission to enter facilities \nthat matched their gender identity; indeed, as discussed above, a \nnumber  of  transgender  students  had  actual  permission  from  the \nagencies with authority over the facilities in question.   \nPart I forecloses these possibilities.  Now, public agencies \nmay not provide any accommodation to transgender individuals other \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 18 of 83\n\nthan the provision of a separate, single-user facility – though \nthey are not required to do so.  Thus, unless the agency that \ncontrols the facility in question openly defies the law, any person \nwho uses a covered facility that does not align with his or her \nbirth  certificate  commits  a  misdemeanor  trespass.    Similarly, \nunless school administrators like Ms. Walker wish to openly defy \nthe law, they cannot give students permission to enter facilities \nthat do not correspond with the sex on their birth certificates \nand presumably must discipline or punish students who disobey this \ndirective. \n \nD. Procedural History \nAlmost immediately, HB2 sparked multiple overlapping federal \nlawsuits.  On March 28, 2016, ACLU-NC, Equality North Carolina, \nand  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs  filed  this  action \nagainst Governor McCrory (in his official capacity), UNC,14 and \nAttorney General Roy Cooper, alleging that various parts of HB2 \ndiscriminate  against  transgender,  gay,  lesbian,  and  bisexual \nindividuals  on  the  basis  of  sex,  sexual  orientation,  and \ntransgender  status  in  violation  of  Title  IX  and  the  Equal \nProtection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n                     \n14 Plaintiffs  named  UNC,  the  UNC  Board  of  Governors,  and  W.  Louis \nBissette, Jr., in his official capacity as Chairman of the UNC Board of \nGovernors, as Defendants.  For convenience and clarity, the court refers \nto these and other related entities collectively as “UNC,” except where \notherwise indicated. \n \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 19 of 83\n\n(Doc. 1.)15   \nOn May 9, 2016, the United States filed a separate action \nagainst the State, Governor McCrory (in his official capacity), \nthe North Carolina Department of Public Safety (“NCDPS”), and UNC, \nseeking a declaration that compliance with Part I constitutes sex \ndiscrimination in violation of Title IX, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013, 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13) (“VAWA”), \nand Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e \net seq. (“Title VII”).  (Doc. 1 in case no. 1:16cv425 (the “425 \ncase”).)  \nThat same day, State officials filed two separate declaratory \njudgment  actions  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nEastern District of North Carolina.  Governor McCrory and Frank \nPerry,  Secretary  of  NCDPS,  filed  an  action  in  their  official \ncapacities  against  the  United  States  and  the  United  States \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”), seeking a declaration that HB2 does \nnot  violate  Title  VII  or  VAWA  (case  no.  5:16cv238  (the  “238 \ncase”)).  Meanwhile, Senator Berger and Representative Moore filed \na separate lawsuit against DOJ on behalf of the General Assembly, \nseeking a declaration that HB2 does not violate Title VII, Title \nIX, or VAWA, as well as declarations that DOJ had violated both \nthe  Administrative  Procedure  Act  and  various  constitutional \n                     \n15 Plaintiffs dropped Equality North Carolina and Attorney General Cooper \nin their first amended complaint on April 21, 2016.  (Doc. 9.) \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 20 of 83\n\nprovisions (case no. 5:16cv240 (the “240 case”)).  Finally, on May \n10, 2016, an organization called North Carolinians for Privacy \nfiled its own action in support of HB2 in the Eastern District, \nseeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  DOJ  and  DOE \nrelated to Title IX, VAWA, the Administrative Procedure Act, and \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act (case no. 5:16cv245 (the \n“245 case”)). \nThe 240 and 245 cases were subsequently transferred to this \ncourt and renumbered 1:16cv844 and 1:16cv845, respectively.  This \ncourt  also  granted  Senator  Berger  and  Representative  Moore’s \nmotion to intervene permissively in both this action (Doc. 44) and \nthe 425 case (Doc. 64 in the 425 case).  As a result, Senator \nBerger  and  Representative  Moore  dismissed  their  separate \ndeclaratory  action  as  duplicative  of  the  claims  and  defenses \npresented  in  the  236  and  425  cases,  (Doc.  33  in  case  no. \n1:16cv844), leaving three HB2 cases pending before this court.  \nThe 238 case remains pending in the Eastern District. \nIn the midst of all of this procedural fencing, Plaintiffs \nfiled the instant motion for preliminary injunction on May 16, \n2016.  (Doc. 21.)  The motion was fully briefed as of June 27, \n2016  (see  Doc.  73),  and  the  court  began  discussions  with  the \nparties regarding an appropriate schedule for a hearing on and \nconsideration of this motion.  However, on July 5, 2016 – two \nmonths after filing its complaint and over three months after the \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 21 of 83\n\npassage  of  HB216  –  the  United  States  filed  its  own  motion  for \npreliminary injunction in the 425 case.  (Doc. 73 in the 425 case.)  \nThe United States’ motion would not be fully briefed until mid-\nAugust  2016,  and  in  light  of  the  Defendants’  request  for \npreliminary discovery, consolidation of United States’ motion with \nPlaintiffs’ motion would likely delay a hearing on the present \nmotion until at least September 2016.   \nAs a result, despite the court’s strong preference to avoid \npiecemeal litigation of the HB2 cases, the court held a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ motion on August 1, 2016, and the court permitted the \nUnited States to participate in light of the fact that the 425 \ncase also contains a Title IX claim.17  The motion is now ready for \ndetermination.   \n \nII. ANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs ask this court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing \nPart I until the court issues a final ruling on the merits.  (Doc. \n                     \n16 The United States also announced that it would not cut off Title IX \nfunding during the pendency of its lawsuit and asked this court for \nrelief from a provision in VAWA that requires it to suspend funding \nforty-five days after filing suit.  (See Doc. 53 in the 425 case.) \n   \n17 Defendants sought leave to conduct up to six months of discovery before \nresponding to the United States’ motion for preliminary injunction.  (See \nDocs. 53, 61.)  In response to these and other concerns, the court \nexercised its authority under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2) \nto advance the trial in the United States’ action and consolidate it \nwith the hearing on the United States’ motion for preliminary injunction, \nwhich is scheduled to begin November 14, 2016.  (Doc. 104.) \n \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 22 of 83\n\n22 at 44–45.)  Before reaching the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion, \nhowever, the court must first address threshold defenses raised by \nUNC.18 \n \nA. Justiciability and Ripeness \nAs UNC Board of Governors Chairman Louis Bissette has noted, \n“[UNC] is in a difficult position,” in this case, “caught in the \nmiddle between state and federal law.”  (Doc. 23-28 at 2.)  Neither \nembracing nor repudiating Part I, UNC argues that while it intends \nto comply with the law, it does not intend to enforce the law \nbecause Part I contains no mechanism to do so.  UNC argues that \nPart I therefore has essentially no effect on its campuses and \nthat this court should not consider the individual transgender \nPlaintiffs’  Title  IX  claim  for  jurisdictional  and  prudential \nreasons.19  For the reasons that follow, the court disagrees.  \n“Federal  courts  are  principally  deciders  of  disputes,  not \noracular  authorities.    We  address  particular  cases  or \n                     \n18 UNC has also filed a motion to dismiss the claims against it.  (Doc. \n89.)  The motion to dismiss raises similar issues, as well as additional \nissues not addressed in the briefing on the present motion.  (See Doc. \n90.)  The court will issue a separate ruling on the motion to dismiss \nat a later date. \n \n19 UNC also argues that it is immune from the individual transgender \nPlaintiff’s constitutional claims and that Chairman Bissette is not a \nproper  party  under  Ex  Parte  Young,  209  U.S.  123  (1908).    Because \nPlaintiffs have since moved to amend their complaint to drop Chairman \nBissette and substitute UNC President Margaret Spellings as a Defendant \n(see Doc. 116-1 ¶¶ 11–12), and because the court will not grant relief \non their constitutional claims at this time, see infra Section II.B.1.b, \nthe court does not reach these issues.   \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 23 of 83\n\ncontroversies  and  may  not  arbitrate  abstract  differences  of \nopinion.”  Doe v. Duling, 782 F.2d 1202, 1205 (4th Cir. 1986) \n(citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    This \nrequirement stems from Article III, Section 2 of the United States \nConstitution  and  presents  both  jurisdictional  and  prudential \nlimits on the exercise of federal judicial power.  Warth v. Seldin, \n422  U.S.  490,  498–99  (1975).    As  a  jurisdictional  matter,  a \nplaintiff  complaining  about  State  conduct  must  show  “some \nthreatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal \naction.”  Id. at 499 (quoting Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. \n614, 617 (1973)).  For example, where the dispute concerns the \nvalidity of a criminal statute, the challenger must show a credible \nthreat  of  prosecution  in  order  to  establish  a  live  case  or \ncontroversy.  Duling, 782 F.2d at 1205–06.   \nSimilarly, the prudential ripeness requirement is designed to \nprevent  courts  from  “entangling  themselves  in  abstract \ndisagreements  over  administrative  policies”  until  “an \nadministrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt \nin a concrete way by the challenging parties.”  Ohio Forestry \nAss’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732–33 (1998) (quoting \nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148–49 (1967).  A case is \nripe and fit for judicial decision when the “rule or action giving \nrise to the controversy is final and not dependent upon future \nuncertainties or intervening agency rulings.”  Franks v. Ross, 313 \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 24 of 83\n\nF.3d 184, 195 (4th Cir. 2002).  In determining whether a case is \nripe, the court must consider both “the fitness of the issues for \njudicial decision” and the “hardship to the parties of withholding \ncourt  consideration.”    Ohio  Forestry  Ass’n,  523  U.S.  at  733 \n(quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149). \nHere, UNC points to numerous statements from UNC President \nMargaret Spellings, including a guidance memorandum sent to the \nchancellors of all UNC constituent institutions, that Part I “does \nnot  contain  provisions  concerning  enforcement”  and  that  the \nuniversity’s non-discrimination policies, which generally prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity, “remain in effect.”  \n(See, e.g., Doc. 38-5 at 1–2.)  The guidance memorandum also notes, \nhowever,  that  UNC  must  “fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  law \nunless or until the court directs otherwise.”  (Id. at 2.)  UNC \ntherefore acknowledges that “University institutions must require \nevery  multiple  occupancy  bathroom  and  changing  facility  to  be \ndesignated for and used only by persons based on their biological \nsex.”  (Id. at 1 (emphasis added).)  President Spellings directed \nconstituent institutions to take three specific actions under the \nlaw:  (1)  maintain  existing  single-sex  signage  on  multiple \noccupancy  bathrooms  and  other  similar  facilities,  (2)  provide \nnotice of HB2 to campus constituencies as appropriate, and (3) \nshare  information  about  the  locations  of  single  occupancy \nbathrooms on campus.  (See id. at 1–2.)    \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 25 of 83\n\nDespite the assertion that UNC does not intend to “enforce” \nPart  I,  UNC’s  pronouncements  are  sufficient  to  establish  a \njusticiable case or controversy.  The university has repeatedly \nindicated that it will – indeed, it must – comply with State law.  \n(Id. at 1–2.)  Although UNC has not changed the words and symbols \non its sex-segregated facilities, the meaning of those words and \nsymbols has changed as a result of Part I, and UNC has no legal \nauthority to tell its students or employees otherwise.  In light \nof Part I, the sex-segregated signs deny permission to those whose \nbirth certificates fail to identify them as a match.  UNC can avoid \nthis result only by either (1) openly defying the law, which it \nhas no legal authority to do, or (2) ordering that all bathrooms, \nshowers, and other similar facilities on its campuses be designated \nas single occupancy, gender-neutral facilities.  Understandably, \nUNC has chosen to do neither. \nAs  a  result,  although  President  Spellings  promises  to \n“investigate”  instances  in  which  individuals  are  excluded  from \nbathrooms “to determine whether there has been a violation of the \nUniversity nondiscrimination policy and applicable law” (Doc. 38-\n1 ¶ 15), this does not help UNC because it has not expressly given \nany student or employee permission to the use bathrooms, showers, \nand other facilities consistent with his or her gender identity.  \nTo  the  contrary,  UNC  has  explicitly  acknowledged  that  Part  I \n“remains the law of the State” and that neither UNC nor its non-\n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 26 of 83\n\ndiscrimination  policies  has  “independent  power  to  change  that \nlegal reality.”  (Doc. 23-27 at 2–3.)  Unless and until UNC openly \ndefies the law, the signs that UNC posts on its bathrooms, showers, \nand other similar facilities render transgender individuals who \nuse  facilities  that  match  their  gender  identities  trespassers, \nthus exposing them to potential punishment (certainly by other \nauthorities, if not by UNC).  In addition, if the trespasser is a \nstudent, he or she is subject to discipline under one of UNC’s \nstudent codes of conduct, which generally prohibit students from \nviolating federal, State, or local laws.  (See, e.g., Doc. 67-8 at \n3.) \nThus, contrary to UNC’s characterizations, this is not a case \nin which an arcane criminal law lingers on the books for decades \nwith no threat of enforcement.  See, e.g., Duling, 782 F.2d at \n1206 (finding no justiciable case or controversy surrounding a \nfornication and cohabitation statute when there had been no arrests \nor prosecutions pursuant to the law for several decades).  Nor is \nthis a case in which public agencies do nothing more than “stand \nready to perform their general duty to enforce laws.”  See id.  \nInstead,  UNC  currently  instructs  the  individual  transgender \nplaintiffs that Part I is in effect on UNC’s campuses.  (See, e.g., \nDoc. 67-5 at 3 (memorandum from UNC Chancellor Carol Folt stating, \n“The memo from UNC General Administration also confirms that the \nlaw relating to public restrooms and changing facilities does apply \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 27 of 83\n\nto the University.”).)  That UNC has not articulated plans for \nadministering a specific punishment for transgender individuals \nwho  violate  its  policy  does  not  undermine  the  existence  of  a \njusticiable  case  or  controversy.    See  G.G.  ex  rel.  Grimm  v. \nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 716–17 (4th Cir. 2016) \n(evaluating the merits of a Title IX claim involving transgender \nbathroom  use  without  discussing  whether  the  school  board  had \nthreatened the student with any specific punishment for disobeying \nthe policy), stay and recall of mandate granted, 136 S. Ct. 2442.   \nThese  considerations  also  dictate  the  ripeness  analysis.  \nPresident Spellings has indicated that she does not intend to take \nany further action, including promulgating any further guidelines \nor regulations with regard to Part I, until after this lawsuit \nconcludes.  (Doc. 38-1 at ¶ 16.)  As a result, a delay will not \nrender this case more fit for judicial review.  See Ohio Forestry \nAss’n, 523 U.S. at 733.  In addition, for reasons discussed below, \nUNC’s exclusion of the individual transgender Plaintiffs from sex-\nsegregated facilities that match their gender identity causes them \nsubstantial hardship each day the policy is in effect.  See infra \nSection II.B.2.  As a result, this case is prudentially ripe. \n \nB. Preliminary Relief \nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must \nmake a “clear showing” that (1) it is likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 28 of 83\n\nof preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its \nfavor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 21 (2008).  All four \nrequirements must be satisfied in order for relief to be granted.  \nReal Truth About Obama, Inc. v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 575 F.3d \n342, 346 (4th Cir. 2009), vacated on other grounds, 559 U.S. 1089 \n(2010).    A  preliminary  injunction  is  “an  extraordinary  remedy \ninvolving the exercise of a very far-reaching power, which is to \nbe applied only in the limited circumstances which clearly demand \nit.”  Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, \n811  (4th  Cir.  1991)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).    Plaintiffs  must  show  more  than  a  grave  or  serious \nquestion for litigation; they must “clearly” demonstrate that they \nare “likely” to succeed on the merits.  Real Truth About Obama, \n575 F.3d at 346-47. \n \n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n \na. Title IX \nTo  establish  a  claim  under  Title  IX,  the  individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs must show that (1) they were excluded from \nparticipation in an education program because of their sex; (2) \nthe  educational  institution  was  receiving  federal  financial \nassistance at the time of their exclusion; and (3) the improper \ndiscrimination caused them harm.  G.G., 822 F.3d at 718.  UNC and \nits constituent institutions receive federal financial assistance \n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 29 of 83\n\nunder Title IX.  (See Doc. 23-27 at 2.)  In addition, for the \nreasons explained below, UNC’s enforcement of Part I has caused \nmedical and other harms to the individual transgender Plaintiffs.  \nSee infra Section II.B.2.  Thus, the primary question for the court \nis whether the individual transgender Plaintiffs are likely to \nshow that Part I unlawfully excludes them from certain bathrooms, \nshowers, and other facilities on the basis of sex. \nTitle IX provides: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance.”    20  U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).  This prohibition against sex discrimination protects \nemployees as well as students.  N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 \nU.S. 512, 530 (1982).  As a result, covered institutions may not \n“limit  any  person  in  the  enjoyment  of  any  right,  privilege, \nadvantage,  or  opportunity”  on  the  basis  of  sex.    34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.31(b)(7);  see  also  id.  § 106.31(b)(2)  (prohibiting \ndiscrimination in the provision of “aid, benefits, or services”).  \nAccess  to  bathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar  facilities \nqualifies as a “right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity” for \nthe purposes of Title IX.  G.G., 822 F.3d at 718 n.4.   \n“Title  IX  is  a  broadly  written  general  prohibition  on \ndiscrimination, followed by specific, narrow exceptions to that \nbroad prohibition.”  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 30 of 83\n\n167, 175 (2005).  Thus, “[n]ot all distinctions on the basis of \nsex are impermissible under Title IX.”  G.G., 822 F.3d at 718.  \nFor example, the statute itself contains an exception that permits \ncovered institutions to “maintain[] separate living facilities for \nthe  different  sexes.”    20  U.S.C.  § 1686.    In  addition,  a  DOE \nregulation states that covered institutions “may provide separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of the other \nsex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nUntil very recently, little to no explicit authority existed \nregarding the application of Title IX and its related regulations \nto transgender students and employees.  Around 2013, however, DOE \nbegan taking the position that covered institutions must treat \ntransgender  individuals  consistent  with  their  gender  identity.  \n(See Doc. 23-29 at 3 (citing Letter from Anurima Bhargava, Chief, \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, and Arthur Zeidman, Director, U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc. Office of Civil Rights, to Dr. Joel Shawn, Superintendent, \nArcadia  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  (July  24,  2013),  available  at \nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2013/07/2\n6/arcadialetter.pdf).)   \nOn April 19, 2016, the Fourth Circuit concluded that courts \nmust defer to DOE’s relatively recent position in the context of \nsex-segregated bathrooms.  G.G., 822 F.3d at 723.  In G.G., a high \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 31 of 83\n\nschool sophomore in eastern Virginia transitioned from female to \nmale, living as a boy in all aspects of life.  Id. at 715.  School \nofficials initially supported G.G.’s transition and took steps to \nensure that teachers and staff treated the student as a boy.  Id.  \nSchool  officials  also  gave  G.G.  permission  to  use  the  boys’ \nbathrooms, although they made no decision with regard to locker \nrooms  or  showers  because  G.G.  did  not  participate  in  physical \neducation.  Id. & n.2.  G.G. used the boys’ bathrooms without \nincident  for  several  weeks.    Id.  at  715–16.    At  some  point, \nhowever, parents and community members began contacting the local \nschool board to complain about G.G.’s use of the boys’ bathrooms.  \nId. at 716.  In response, the school board implemented a policy \nlimiting access to sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms based \non “biological gender” and requiring its schools to provide “an \nalternative appropriate private facility” to accommodate students \nwith “gender identity issues.”  Id.  The school board also mandated \na series of steps designed to improve privacy for all students, \nincluding adding partitions and privacy strips in bathrooms and \nconstructing additional single occupancy bathrooms.  Id. \nShortly after the school board adopted its new policy, G.G. \nrequested an opinion letter from DOE regarding the application of \nTitle IX to transgender students.  See id. at 732 (Niemeyer, J., \ndissenting in part).  On January 7, 2015, DOE responded with an \nopinion letter that states,  \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 32 of 83\n\nThe  Department’s  Title  IX  regulations  permit \nschools  to  provide  sex-segregated  restrooms,  locker \nrooms, shower facilities, housing, athletic teams, and \nsingle-sex classes under certain circumstances.  When a \nschool elects to separate or treat students differently \non  the  basis  of  sex  in  those  situations,  a  school \ngenerally  must  treat  transgender  students  consistent \nwith their gender identity.   \n \n(Doc. 23-29 (the “DOE opinion letter”).)  On June 11, 2015, G.G. \nsued  the  school  board,  claiming  that  the  policy  of  excluding \nstudents  from  bathrooms  on  the  basis  of  “biological  gender” \nviolated Title IX.  G.G., 822 F.3d at 717.   \nThe  district  court  dismissed  G.G.’s  Title  IX  claim, \nconcluding that the DOE opinion letter is not entitled to deference \nunder the doctrine announced in Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 \n(1997).  See G.G., 822 F.3d at 717.20  The district court concluded \nthat 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which permits schools to “provide separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” \nunambiguously refers to a student’s “birth or biological sex.”  \n822 F.3d at 719.  The district court also reasoned that, even if \nthe meaning of the phrase “on the basis of sex” were ambiguous in \nthis  regulation,  then  DOE’s  interpretation  would  be  clearly \nerroneous and inconsistent with the regulation because “‘on the \nbasis of  sex’ means,  at most,  on the basis of  sex and  gender \n                     \n20 Under Auer, an agency’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation \nis  “controlling  unless  plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation.”  519 U.S. at 461 (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n   \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 33 of 83\n\ntogether, [so] it cannot mean on the basis of gender alone.”  Id.   \nThe Fourth Circuit reversed.  Id. at 727.  The court first \nconcluded that the phrase “on the basis of sex” in § 106.33 is \nambiguous because the regulation “is silent as to how a school \nshould determine whether a transgender individual is a male or \nfemale.”    Id.  at  720.    The  court  then  determined  that  DOE’s \ninterpretation, while “novel” and “perhaps not the intuitive one,” \nis not clearly erroneous because a dictionary from 1971 defined \nthe word “sex” as encompassing “morphological, physiological, and \nbehavioral” characteristics.  Id. at 721–22.21  Finally, the court \nconcluded that the DOE opinion letter reflects the agency’s fair \nand  considered  judgment  on  policy  formulation,  rather  than  a \nconvenient litigating position.  Id. at 722–23.  As a result, the \ncourt remanded with instructions for the district court to give \nthe DOE opinion letter “controlling weight” with regard to the \nmeaning of § 106.33.  Id. at 723, 727. \nOn  remand,  the  district  court  entered  a  preliminary \ninjunction requiring the school board to allow G.G. to use the \nboys’ bathrooms.  G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., \nNo. 4:15cv54, 2016 WL 3581852, at *1 (E.D. Va.

However, on August 3, 2016 – two days after the hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ motion in the present case – the Supreme Court stayed \nthe Fourth Circuit’s mandate and the district court’s preliminary \ninjunction until it could rule on the school board’s forthcoming \npetition for a writ of certiorari.  Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. v. \nG.G. ex rel. Grimm, 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016).  Such intervention is \ngranted where a lower court “tenders a ruling out of harmony with \n[the Supreme Court’s] prior decisions, or [raises] questions of \ntranscending public importance, or [presents] issues which would \nlikely induce [the] Court to grant certiorari.”  See Russo v. \nByrne, 409 U.S. 1219, 1221 (1972) (Douglas, J.).     \nIn light of the foregoing, the fate of G.G. is uncertain.  \nBut, despite the stay and recall of the mandate, the Supreme Court \ndid not vacate or reverse the Fourth Circuit’s decision.  See G.G., \n136 S. Ct. at 2442.  Thus, while other courts may reach contrary \ndecisions,  see  Texas  v.  United  States,  No.  7:16cv54,  2016  WL \n4426495, at *14–15, (N.D. Tex.

See United States \nv.

First, the court must determine whether Part I violates \nTitle IX’s general prohibition against sex discrimination.  See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a).  Second, if Part I violates Title IX’s general \nprohibition  against  sex  discrimination,  the  court  must  then \ndetermine  whether  an  exception  to  that  general  prohibition \n                     \ninitiation of this case, this court remains bound by G.G. and the Texas \norder has no direct effect on this litigation. \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 36 of 83\n\napplies.  See Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175 (“Title IX is a broadly \nwritten  general  prohibition  on  discrimination,  followed  by \nspecific, narrow exceptions to that broad prohibition.”).  The \nonly potentially applicable exception cited by the parties comes \nfrom a DOE regulation that allows schools to “provide separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex.”  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  However, in light of G.G., this court must \ngive controlling weight to the DOE opinion letter, which states \nthat schools “generally must treat transgender students consistent \nwith their gender identity” (Doc. 23-29 at 3), when considering \nthe  scope  of  this  exception  during  the  second  stage  of  the \nanalysis. \nUnder this framework, the Title IX analysis in this case is \nrelatively straightforward.  Part I requires schools to segregate \nmultiple  occupancy  bathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar \nfacilities  on  the  basis  of  sex.    HB2  § 1.2–1.3.    Because  the \nprovision  of  sex-segregated  facilities  necessarily  requires \nschools to treat individuals differently depending on their sex, \nPart I falls within Title IX’s general prohibition against sex \ndiscrimination.  The only potentially applicable exception comes \nfrom § 106.33, which permits sex-segregated bathrooms and other \nfacilities.  But G.G. and the DOE opinion letter teach that, for \nthe purposes of this regulation, a school generally must treat \nstudents consistent with their gender identity.  (See 822 F.3d at \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 37 of 83\n\n723; Doc. 23-29 at 3.)  Part I, by contrast, requires schools to \ntreat  students  consistent  with  their  birth  certificates, \nregardless of gender identity.  HB2 §§ 1.2–1.3.  Thus, although \nPart I is consistent with the DOE opinion letter when applied to \nmost students, it is inconsistent with the DOE opinion letter as \napplied  to  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs,  whose  birth \ncertificates do not align with their gender identity.  As a result, \nPart  I  does  not  qualify  for  the  regulatory  exception  -  as \ninterpreted by DOE - and therefore appears to violate Title IX \nwhen applied to the individual transgender Plaintiffs. \nDefendants raise a number of objections to the application of \nG.G. in this case, but none is sufficient at this time.   \nDefendants first argue that the Fourth Circuit’s holding in \nG.G. is limited to bathrooms and does not extend to showers or \nother similar facilities.  True, G.G. concluded that “the [DOE’s] \ninterpretation of its own regulation, § 106.33, as it relates to \nrestroom access by transgender individuals, is entitled to Auer \ndeference and is to be accorded controlling weight.”  822 F.3d at \n723.  Further, the court noted that because G.G. did not seek \naccess to other facilities, “[o]nly restroom use is at issue in \nthis case.”  Id. at 715 n. 2.  And as to the objections raised, \nthe court commented, “We doubt that G.G.'s use of the communal \nrestroom of his choice threatens the type of constitutional abuses \npresent in the cases cited by the dissent.”  Id. at 723 n.10.  \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 38 of 83\n\nConsequently, the district court only ordered the school board to \nallow G.G. to use boys’ bathrooms.  G.G., 2016 WL 3581852, at *1. \nBut the indispensable foundation of G.G.’s holding is that \nDOE’s interpretation of “sex” in § 106.33, as outlined in the DOE \nopinion letter, is entitled to controlling weight.   822 F.3d at \n723.  As the dissent in G.G. aptly noted, “acceptance of [G.G’s] \nargument  would  necessarily  change  the  definition  of  ‘sex’  for \npurposes of assigning separate living facilities, locker rooms, \nand shower facilities as well.  All are based on ‘sex,’ a term \nthat  must  be  construed  uniformly  throughout  Title  IX  and  its \nimplementing regulations.”  Id. at 734 (Niemeyer, J., dissenting \nin part).  In fact, the majority also agreed with this point.  Id. \nat 723 (“In many respects, we are in agreement with the dissent.  \nWe agree that ‘sex’ should be construed uniformly throughout Title \nIX and its implementing regulations.”).  Moreover, the passage of \nthe  DOE  opinion  letter  –  which  G.G.  requires  be  accorded \ncontrolling  weight  –  explicitly  includes  “locker  rooms”  and \n“shower facilities” among the “situations” in which students must \nbe treated consistent with their gender identity.  (Doc. 23-29 at \n3.)23   \n                     \n23 Indeed, DOE has continued to issue expanded guidance well after the \nfiling of this lawsuit and the 425 case against the State.  DOE’s newest \nguidance explicitly mandates transgender access to all facilities that \nare consistent with their gender identity.  (E.g., Doc. 23-30 at 4 \n(“Restrooms and Locker Rooms. A school may provide separate facilities \non the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 39 of 83\n\nTo be sure, the G.G. court did note that the bathrooms at the \nVirginia school were separately partitioned.  822 F.3d at 716.  \nBut it is difficult to find any articulation of how that fact was \nimportant to the court’s reasoning.  Although showers and changing \nrooms clearly present obvious practical concerns that differ from \nbathrooms, both the logic and holding of G.G. make no distinction \nbetween facilities.  The court made this point clear by noting \nthat  in  applying  its  analytical  framework  it  would  not  weigh \n“privacy interests or safety concerns – fundamentally questions of \npolicy” which it said was “a task committed to the agency, not the \ncourts.”  Id. at 723-24.24 \nWhile district courts are often said to be the “front line \nexperimenters in the laboratories of difficult legal questions,” \nHively v. Ivy Tech Comm. Coll., South Bend, --- F.3d ---, 2016 WL \n4039703, at *4 (7th Cir. 2016), they are bound to follow circuit \nprecedent.  To accept Defendants’ argument – which is more an \nattack on G.G.’s reasoning than a legal distinction – would violate \n                     \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity.”).)  This guidance \ndoes not include the qualifier “generally,” which was included in the \nDOE opinion letter.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs contend that this document, which \nwas not available at the time of G.G., is also entitled to Auer deference.  \n(See Doc. 22 at 14.)  The Texas court, which was not bound by G.G., \nconcluded that this guidance is not entitled to Auer deference.  2016 \nWL 4426495, at *15. \n \n24 Nor does it appear that the court or DOE considered the potentially \nsignificant costs associated with retrofitting some facilities to ensure \nprivacy.  \n \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 40 of 83\n\nthat obligation.  Therefore, at this early stage on a motion for \npreliminary relief pending trial, it is enough to say that G.G. \nrequires Title IX institutions in this circuit to generally treat \ntransgender  students  consistent  with  their  gender  identity, \nincluding  in  showers  and  changing  rooms.    (Doc.  23-29  at  3.)  \nDefendants do not deny that Part I bars Title IX institutions from \nattempting to accommodate such students in any fashion, except in \nthe limited form of a separate facility that is optional in the \nState’s discretion.  See HB2 §§ 1.2–1.3.  Thus, G.G. indicates \nthat the individual transgender Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non the merits of their Title IX claim.   \nEven  Plaintiffs  accept  that  the  State’s  interests  are \nlegitimate and seem to acknowledge that there may be practical \nlimits  to  the  application  of  DOE’s  guidance,  especially  where \nminors are involved.  (See Doc. 103 at 15–21.)25  At the hearing, \ncounsel  for  the  amici  school  administrators  represented  that \npublic school showers and changing rooms - facilities in which \nstudents are likely to be partially or fully nude – today often \ncontain  partitions,  dividers,  and  other  mechanisms  to  protect \nprivacy similar to bathrooms.  (See Doc. 103 at 137–38.)  This \nsuggests that, as in G.G., other forms of accommodation might be \n                     \n25 DOJ, however, argues that DOE’s guidance makes no such allowance and \nthat G.G.’s holding requires controlling weight across all facilities.  \n(Doc. 103 at 54-57.)   \n \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 41 of 83\n\navailable to protect privacy and safety concerns.  See G.G., 822 \nF.3d at 723 (agreeing that “‘an individual has a legitimate and \nimportant interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude or \npartially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts’ are not \ninvoluntarily exposed” and concluding that “[i]t is not apparent \nto us, however, that the truth of these propositions undermines \nthe  conclusion  we  reach”  to  grant  DOE’s  interpretation  of  its \nregulations controlling weight).26  Ultimately, the question of \ndetermining the full scope of transgender users’ rights to these \nmore intimate facilities under DOE’s interpretation – as to which \nthe State has significant legitimate interests – is not before the \ncourt.  For now, it suffices to say that Part I’s blanket ban that \nforecloses  any  form  of  accommodation  for  transgender  students \nother than separate facilities likely violates Title IX under G.G.   \nDefendants also note that the school board policy in G.G. did \nnot include any criteria for determining the “biological gender” \nof particular students.  See 822 F.3d at 721–22.  By contrast, \nPart I includes a simple, objective criterion – the sex listed on \nthe  individual’s  birth  certificate  –  for  determining  an \nindividual’s “biological sex.”  HB2 §§ 1.2–1.3.  Defendants are \ncorrect on this point.  But the holding of G.G. did not turn on \n                     \n26 For example, Part I excludes some transgender users from showers and \nchanging rooms that match their gender identity even if such facilities \nare fully partitioned or otherwise unoccupied. \n42 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 42 of 83\n\nany supposed ambiguity in the school board’s policy.  Instead, \nG.G. rested on the Fourth Circuit’s determination that the DOE \nopinion letter is entitled to controlling weight under Auer.  822 \nF.3d at 723.  The DOE opinion letter does not even remotely suggest \nthat schools may treat students inconsistent with their gender \nidentity so long as the school has clear criteria for determining \nan individual’s “biological sex.” \nDefendants  next  argue  that  G.G.  did  not  involve  any \nconstitutional challenges to DOE regulations or the DOE opinion \nletter.    True,  the  Fourth  Circuit  noted  the  absence  of  such \nchallenges in G.G., see id. at 723–24, whereas Defendants did raise \nsuch issues in their answer and counterclaims (see Doc. 54 ¶¶ 120–\n25).  But Defendants have not raised any constitutional defenses \nin  their  responses  to  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs therefore have \nnot yet responded to these issues.27  The court cannot ignore G.G. \nand simply assume that Defendants will prevail on constitutional \ndefenses that they may or may not develop at some point in the \n                     \n27 In fact, although Senator Berger and Representative Moore’s brief \nincorporates some portions of their answer by reference, it does not \nincorporate the constitutional claims or defenses to the Title IX claim.  \n(See Doc. 61 at 13 (referencing defenses to Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection \nand Due Process claims).)  At the hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion, the \nlegislators  first  raised  the  argument  that  enforcing  DOE’s \ninterpretation of “sex” would constitute a Spending Clause violation \nunder Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 15-16 \n(1981).  (Doc. 103 at 81-85.)  As Defendants have yet to develop this \ndefense, it does not rise to the level of undermining the individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs’ showing of a likelihood of success on the merits.   \n43 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 43 of 83\n\nfuture.  See Native Ecosystems Council & All. for the Wild Rockies \nv. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 4:11-cv-212, 2011 WL 4015662, at *10 \nn.10 (D. Idaho Sept. 9, 2011) (declining to consider claims not \nraised  in  a  party’s  brief  for  the  purposes  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction but preserving those claims for the remainder of the \ncase); see also Carter v. Lee, 283 F.3d 240, 252 n.11 (4th Cir. \n2002)  (contentions  not  raised  in  a  party’s  opening  brief  are \ngenerally considered to be waived).  Of course, Defendants may \nultimately develop successful constitutional defenses at a later \nstage of the proceedings.   \nFinally, Defendants argue that this case differs from G.G. \nbecause that case involved no major complaints or safety concerns \nfrom students.  Defendants are correct, though community members \ncertainly raised these kinds of objections.  See G.G., 822 F.3d at \n715–16.  But on this record, Defendants have not offered sufficient \nevidence  to  distinguish  Plaintiffs’  factual  circumstances,  or \nthose pertaining to anyone else in North Carolina for that matter, \nfrom those in G.G.28  To the contrary, the current record indicates \nthat  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs  used  bathrooms  and \n                     \n28 Defendants did present two news articles describing men in Seattle and \nVirginia who entered women’s bathrooms or showers.  (Docs. 55-1, 55-52.)  \nNeither man claimed to be transgender; one was apparently protesting a \nlocal ordinance, while the other was arrested for peeping.  (See id.)  \nNorth  Carolina’s  peeping  and  indecent  exposure  statutes  continue  to \nprotect the privacy of citizens regardless of Part I, and there is no \nindication that a sexual predator could successfully claim transgender \nstatus as a defense against prosecution under these statutes.  \n44 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 44 of 83\n\nlocker  rooms  corresponding  with  their  gender  identity  without \ncomplaint for far longer than G.G. used the boys’ bathrooms at his \nschool.  (Compare Doc. 22-4 ¶¶ 15, 30 (approximately five months), \nand Doc. 22-8 ¶¶ 19, 25 (approximately eighteen months), and Doc. \n22-9 ¶¶ 15, 19–20 (same), with G.G., 822 F.3d at 715–16 (seven \nweeks).  Moreover, as noted above and like the situation in G.G., \nbathroom,  shower,  and  other  facilities  are  often  separately \npartitioned to preserve privacy and safety concerns.  (See Doc. \n103  at  138;  Doc.  22-19  ¶ 14.)    Finally,  the  Fourth  Circuit’s \nanalysis in G.G. did not rest on the specific circumstances of \nthat  case  or  the  wisdom  of  DOE’s  position,  but  rather  on  the \ndeference owed to the DOE opinion letter.  Id. at 723-24 (“[T]he \nweighing of privacy interests or safety concerns — fundamentally \nquestions of policy — is a task committed to the agency, not the \ncourts. . . . To the extent the dissent critiques the result we \nreach today on policy grounds, we reply that, our Auer analysis \ncomplete,  we  leave  policy  formulation  to  the  political \nbranches.”).   \n*   *   * \nG.G. compels the conclusion that the individual transgender \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX \nclaim.    Part  I’s  wholesale  ban  on  access  to  facilities  is \ninconsistent with DOE’s guidance on Title IX compliance under G.G. \nand  precludes  educational  institutions  from  attempting  to \n45 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 45 of 83\n\naccommodate  particular  transgender  individuals  who  wish  such \naccommodation in bathrooms and other facilities.29   \n \nb. Constitutional Claims \nIn addition to their Title IX claim, Plaintiffs also seek \naccess to sex-segregated facilities at public rest stops and other \nentities not covered by Title IX.  As a result, despite granting \nrelief under Title IX, the court must also consider Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims.  The constitutional claims in this case \nraise novel and difficult questions in a context underdeveloped in \nthe law.  As a practical matter, therefore, Plaintiffs’ task of \npresenting  the  kind  of  “clear  showing”  necessary  to  justify \npreliminary relief, Winter, 555 U.S. at 22, is even more difficult \nin this case.  Thus, this court is more cautious to act where the \napplication of existing principles of law to new areas is uncertain \nand novel, particularly in the context of a preliminary injunction.  \nSee Capital Associated Indus. v. Cooper, 129 F. Supp. 3d 281, 288–\n89 (M.D.N.C. 2015) (“Where, as in this case, ‘substantial issues \n                     \n29  Plaintiffs  argue  in  supplemental  briefing  that  “broad  relief” \nequivalent to a facial ban of HB2 is necessary to ensure protection of \nthe individual transgender Plaintiffs’ rights.  (Doc. at 13.)  But there \nis no class-wide claim presently pending, and ACLU-NC did not allege a \nTitle IX claim.  In light of UNC’s insistence that it will not take any \nfurther action in response to Part I, broader relief is not necessary \nto ensure that the individual transgender Plaintiffs receive effective \npreliminary relief.  Cf. Nat’l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) \nv. Mullen, 608 F. Supp. 945, 964 (N.D. Cal. 1985) (ordering broad relief \non individual claims where the individual plaintiffs were at “significant \nrisk for repeated rights violations” because government actors could not \neffectively “distinguish the parties from the nonparties”).   \n46 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 46 of 83\n\nof constitutional dimensions’ are before the court, those issues \n‘should be fully developed at trial in order to [e]nsure a proper \nand just resolution.’” (quoting Wetzel v. Edwards, 635 F.2d 283, \n291 (4th Cir. 1980))); see also Gantt v. Clemson Agr. Coll. of \nS.C., 208 F. Supp. 416, 418 (W.D.S.C. 1962) (“On an application \nfor  preliminary  injunction,  the  court  is  not  bound  to  decide \ndoubtful and difficult questions of law or disputed questions of \nfact.”).   \n \ni. Equal Protection \nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State may “deny to \nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the \nlaws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  However, this broad principle \n“must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation \nclassifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage \nto various groups or persons.”  Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 \n(1996).  As a result, the Supreme Court has “attempted to reconcile \nthe principle with the reality” by prescribing different levels of \nscrutiny depending on whether a law “targets a suspect class.”  \nId.  Laws that do not target a suspect class are subject to rational \nbasis  review,  and  courts  should  “uphold  the  legislative \nclassification so long as it bears a rational relation to some \nlegitimate end.”  Id.  By contrast, laws that target a suspect \nclass, such as race, are subject to strict scrutiny.  See City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).   \n47 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 47 of 83\n\nIt  is  well  settled  that  classifications  based  on  sex  are \nsubject to intermediate scrutiny.  See United States v. Virginia, \n518 U.S. 515, 532–33 (1996).  Under intermediate scrutiny, the \nState must demonstrate that the challenged law serves “‘important \ngovernmental  objectives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means \nemployed’ are ‘substantially related to the achievement of those \nobjectives.’”  Id. at 533 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. \nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982)).  Unlike strict scrutiny, the \ngovernment is not required to show that the law is the “least \nintrusive means of achieving the relevant government objective.”  \nUnited  States  v.  Staten,  666  F.3d  154,  159  (4th  Cir.  2011) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “In other words, \nthe fit needs to be reasonable; a perfect fit is not required.”  \nId.  at  162.    Nevertheless,  “[t]he  burden  of  justification  is \ndemanding and it rests entirely on the State.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. \nat 533.  In addition, the justification must be “genuine, not \nhypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.”  Id.  \nFinally,  the  justification  “must  not  rely  on  overbroad \ngeneralizations  about  the  different  talents,  capacities,  or \npreferences of males and females.”  Id. \nHere, Part I classifies citizens on the basis of “biological \nsex” and requires that each sex use separate multiple occupancy \nbathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities.  HB2 §§ 1.2–1.3.  \nBecause  Part  I  facially  classifies  and  discriminates  among \n48 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 48 of 83\n\ncitizens on the basis of sex, intermediate scrutiny applies.30  See \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 532–33.   \nThere is no question that the protection of bodily privacy is \nan important government interest and that the State may promote \nthis interest by excluding members of the opposite sex from places \nin  which  individuals  are  likely  to  engage  in  intimate  bodily \nfunctions.  See, e.g., Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th \nCir.  1993)  (“The  point  is  illustrated  by  society’s  undisputed \napproval of separate public rest rooms for men and women based on \nprivacy concerns.  The need for privacy justifies separation and \nthe differences between the genders demand a facility for each \ngender that is different.”); Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117, 1119 \n(4th Cir. 1989) (“Most people, however, have a special sense of \nprivacy in their genitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the \npresence of people of the other sex may be especially demeaning \nand humiliating.”); see also Doe v. Luzerne Cty., 660 F.3d 169, \n176–77  (3d  Cir.  2011)  (observing  that  several  circuits  have \nrecognized  “a  constitutionally  protected  privacy  interest  in \n                     \n30 The parties have devoted substantial time and energy to arguments \nregarding (1) whether transgender individuals qualify as a suspect class \nfor  Equal  Protection  purposes,  and  (2)  whether  Plaintiffs  have \nestablished a sex stereotyping claim under the line of cases beginning \nwith Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (construing Title \nVII).  As Plaintiffs acknowledge, however, success on either of these \ntheories in the context of their Equal Protection claim would result in \nthe court applying the same intermediate level of scrutiny applied to \nlaws that facially classify citizens on the basis of sex.  (Doc. 103 at \n35–36.)  Thus, the court declines to consider these issues at this stage \nbecause Part I facially classifies individuals on the basis of sex. \n49 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 49 of 83\n\n[one’s] partially clothed body”); Sepulveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d \n1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 2012) (stating that “[t]he right to bodily \nprivacy  is  fundamental”  and  noting  that  “common  sense”  and \n“decency”  protect  a  parolee’s  right  not  to  be  observed  by  an \nofficer of the opposite sex while producing a urine sample); York \nv. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963) (“The desire to shield \none’s unclothed figure from view of strangers, and particularly \nstrangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-\nrespect and personal dignity.”).  This interest is particularly \nstrong with regard to minors.  See, e.g., Beard v. Whitmore Lake \nSch. Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Students of course \nhave a significant privacy interest in their unclothed bodies.”); \nDoe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92–93 (7th Cir. 1980) (stating that \nit “does not take a constitutional scholar” to conclude that a \nstrip search invades a student’s privacy rights).  At the hearing \non  this  motion,  Plaintiffs  acknowledged  that  the  practice  of \nsegregating bathrooms and other similar facilities on the basis of \nsex promotes this government interest.  (See Doc. 103 at 15–19.) \nAll  parties  agree  that  bodily  privacy  qualifies  as  an \nimportant State interest and that sex-segregated facilities are \nsubstantially  related  to  that  interest.31    But  the  relevant \n                     \n31 Despite this concession, many of Plaintiffs’ arguments in this case \nwould, if accepted and taken to their logical conclusion, suggest that \nthe time-honored practice of sex-segregated bathrooms and showers is \nunconstitutional.  At the hearing on this motion, counsel speculated \n50 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 50 of 83\n\nauthorities  do  not  define  “sex”  or  explicitly  explain  which \ndifferences between men and women give rise to the State’s interest \nin separating the sexes for privacy purposes; generally, these \ncases simply observe that individuals of one sex have a privacy \ninterest in being separated from “the other sex.”  See, e.g., Lee, \n641 F.2d at 1119.  Not surprisingly, then, the parties disagree \nabout which definition of “sex” promotes the State’s interest in \nbodily privacy.  Defendants contend that bodily privacy interests \narise from physiological differences between men and women, and \nthat sex should therefore be defined in terms of physiology for \nthe purposes of bathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities.  \nPlaintiffs, by contrast, implicitly contend that bodily privacy \ninterests arise from differences in gender identity, and that sex \nshould therefore be defined in terms of gender identity for the \npurposes of these facilities.     \nTo  support  their  position,  Plaintiffs  submitted  expert \ndeclarations stating that, from a “medical perspective,” gender \nidentity  is  the  only  “appropriate”  characteristic  for \ndistinguishing between males and females.  (See, e.g., Doc. 22-1 \n                     \nthat sex-segregated bathrooms are justified, if at all, (1) by virtue \nof  the  long  history  of  providing  such  facilities,  (2)  to  express \nsociety’s belief that “the two sexes, the two genders . . . should be \nseparated except in marriage,” and (3) because no one has bothered to \nchallenge the practice of providing sex-segregated facilities which, \nwhile separate, tend to be roughly equal in quality.  (See id. at 16–\n21.)  \n    \n51 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 51 of 83\n\n¶ 23.)  Defendants have indicated their strong disagreement with \nthis position, though they have not yet offered any evidence on \nthis point in this case.32  But regardless of the characteristics \nthat distinguish men and women for “medical” purposes, Supreme \nCourt and Fourth Circuit precedent supports Defendants’ position \nthat physiological characteristics distinguish men and women for \nthe purposes of bodily privacy. \nAlthough  the  Supreme  Court  has  never  had  an  occasion  to \nexplicitly explain which differences between men and women justify \nthe decision to provide sex-segregated facilities, the Court has \ngenerally assumed that the sexes are primarily defined by their \ndiffering  physiologies.    In  Virginia,  for  example,  the  Court \nrejected the notion that women were not suited for education at \nthe Virginia Military Institute (“VMI”).  See 518 U.S. at 540–46; \nsee also id. at 533 (stating that laws “must not rely on overbroad \ngeneralizations  about  the  different  talent,  capacities,  or \npreferences  of  males  and  females.”).    Even  while  rejecting \nstereotypical assumptions about supposed “inherent differences” \nbetween  men  and  women,  the  Court  acknowledged,  “Physical \ndifferences between men and women . . . are enduring,” adding that \nthe “two sexes are not fungible.”  Id.  The Court then linked these \n                     \n32 As  with  legislative  history,  however,  Defendants  recently  offered \nmedical evidence in the 425 case.  (See Docs. 149-9 through 149-12 in \nthe 425 case.) \n52 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 52 of 83\n\nphysiological  differences  to  privacy  considerations,  adding, \n“Admitting  women  to  VMI  would  undoubtedly  require  alterations \nnecessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex \nin  living  arrangements,  and  to  adjust  aspects  of  the  physical \ntraining programs.”  Id. at 550 n.19. \nVirginia is not the only Equal Protection case to distinguish \nbetween the sexes on the basis of physiology.  In Tuan Anh Nguyen \nv. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 533 U.S. 53 (2001), the \nCourt  upheld  an  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  (“INS”) \npolicy that imposed “a set of requirements on the children of \ncitizen fathers born abroad and out of wedlock to a noncitizen \nmother  that  are  not  imposed  under  like  circumstances  when  the \ncitizen parent is the mother.”  Id. 59–60.  The Court held that \nthe  government’s  “use  of  gender  specific  terms”  is \nconstitutionally  permissible  when  the  relevant  law  “takes  into \naccount a biological difference” between men and women.  Id. at \n64.  The Court rejected the argument that the INS policy reflected \nstereotypes about the roles and capacities of mothers and fathers, \nstating that “the difference does not result from some stereotype, \ndefined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical \nanalysis.”  Id. at 68.  Instead, the Court found, “There is nothing \nirrational or improper in the recognition that at the moment of \nbirth . . . the mother’s knowledge of the child and the fact of \nparenthood have been established in a way not guaranteed in the \n53 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 53 of 83\n\ncase of the unwed father.  This is not a stereotype.”  Id.  Finally, \nthe Court concluded: \nTo  fail  to  acknowledge  even  our  most  basic \nbiological differences . . . risks making the guarantee \nof equal protection superficial, and so disserving it. \nMechanistic  classification  of  all  our  differences  as \nstereotypes  would  operate  to  obscure  those \nmisconceptions  and  prejudices  that  are  real.  The \ndistinction  embodied  in  the  statutory  scheme  here  at \nissue is not marked by misconception and prejudice, nor \ndoes it show disrespect for either class.  The difference \nbetween men and women in relation to the birth process \nis a real one, and the principle of equal protection \ndoes not forbid Congress to address the problem at hand \nin a manner specific to each gender. \n \nId. at 73. \nThe Court’s decisions in Virginia (1996) and Nguyen (2001) \nare not merely relics of an earlier, less enlightened time when \ncourts did not have the benefit of modern medical science.  Rather, \nas recently as January 2016, the Fourth Circuit cited Virginia \napprovingly  while  concluding  that  physiological  differences \njustified treating men and women differently in some contexts.  \nSee Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340, 350 (4th Cir. 2016).  In Bauer, \na male applicant “flunked out of the FBI Academy after falling a \nsingle push-up short of the thirty required of male Trainees.”  \nId. at 342.  The applicant sued, noting that his performance would \nhave qualified him under the different physical fitness standards \napplied to female applicants.  Id.  The Fourth Circuit found that \ndifferent standards for men and women arose from the FBI’s efforts \nto “normalize testing standards between men and women in order to \n54 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 54 of 83\n\naccount for their innate physiological differences,” such that an \napproximately equal number of men and women would pass the tests.  \nId. at 343.  In light of this, the Fourth Circuit concluded that \nthe FBI’s policy was permissible because “equally fit men and women \ndemonstrate their fitness differently.”  Id. at 351.  In concluding \nthat the FBI could distinguish between men and women on the basis \nof physiology, the court explained: \nMen and women simply are not physiologically the \nsame  for  the  purposes  of  physical  fitness  programs. \n. . . The Court recognized [in Virginia] that, although \nVirginia’s use of ‘generalizations about women’ could \nnot be used to exclude them from VMI, some differences \nbetween  the  sexes  were  real,  not  perceived,  and \ntherefore could require accommodations. \n \nId. at 350.33 \nIn  light  of  the  foregoing,  it  appears  that  the  privacy \ninterests  that  justify  the  State’s  provision  of  sex-segregated \nbathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar  facilities  arise  from \nphysiological  differences  between  men  and  women,  rather  than \ndifferences in gender identity.  See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 73; Bauer, 812 F.3d at 350.  The Fourth Circuit \nhas implicitly stated as much, albeit in dicta, noting: \nWhen  . . .  a  gender  classification  is  justified  by \nacknowledged  differences  [between  men  and  women], \nidentical  facilities  are  not  necessarily  mandated.  \nRather, the nature of the difference dictates the type \nof facility permissible for each gender. \n                     \n33 Bauer involved Title VII rather than the Equal Protection Clause.  Id.  \nNevertheless, the Fourth Circuit stated that the same principles “inform \n[its] analysis” of both types of claims.  Id. \n55 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 55 of 83\n\n \nThe point is illustrated by society’s undisputed \napproval of separate public rest rooms for men and women \nbased  on  privacy  concerns.    The  need  for  privacy \njustifies  separation  and  the  differences  between  the \ngenders demand a facility for each that is different.  \nTherefore,  any  analysis  of  the  nature  of  a  specific \nfacility provided in response to a justified purpose, \nmust take into account the nature of the difference on \nwhich the separation is based . . . . \n  \nFaulkner,  10  F.3d  at  232.    In  fact,  even  Plaintiffs’  counsel \nacknowledged the State’s interest in, for example, ensuring that \n“12-year-old girls who are not familiar with male anatomy” are not \nexposed to male genitalia by “somebody older who’s showing that to \nthem, a mature adult.”  (Doc. 103 at 24–25.)  As a result, it \nappears that the constitutionality of Part I depends on whether \nthe  law’s  use  of  birth  certificates  as  a  proxy  for  sex  is \nsubstantially  related  to  the  State’s  privacy  interest  in \nseparating individuals with different physiologies. \nThere is little doubt that Part I is substantially related to \nthe State’s interest in segregating bathrooms, showers, and other \nsimilar facilities on the basis of physiology.  By Plaintiffs’ own \nallegations,  “The  gender  marker  on  a  birth  certificate  is \ndesignated at the time of birth generally based upon the appearance \nof external genitalia.”  (Doc. 9 ¶ 26; see also Doc. 22-1 ¶ 14.)  \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  birth  certificates  are  an  “inaccurate \nproxy  for  an  individual’s  anatomy”  because  some  transgender \nindividuals  have  birth  certificates  that  do  not  reflect  their \n56 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 56 of 83\n\nexternal physiology, either because (1) they were born in a State \nthat permits them to change the sex on their birth certificates \nwithout undergoing sex reassignment surgery, or (2) they were born \nin a State that does not permit them to change the sex on their \nbirth  certificates,  regardless  of  whether  they  undergo  sex \nreassignment surgery.  (Doc. 22 at 32-33.)  But even if the court \nassumes  (contrary  to  the  evidence  in  the  record)  that  no \ntransgender person possesses a birth certificate that accurately \nreflects his or her external physiology, Part I would still be \nsubstantially  related  to  the  State’s  interest  because,  by \nPlaintiffs’ own estimate, only 0.3% of the national population is \ntransgender.  (Doc. 23-37 at 2.)  For the remaining 99.7% of the \npopulation,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  sex  listed  on  an \nindividual’s birth certificate reflects anything other than that \nperson’s  external  genitalia.    Without  reducing  the  “reasonable \nfit” requirement to a numerical comparison, it seems unlikely that \na  law  that  classifies  individuals  with  99.7%  accuracy  is \ninsufficient to survive intermediate scrutiny.  See Staten, 666 \nF.3d at 162 (“In other words, the fit needs to be reasonable; a \nperfect fit is not required.”). \nFinally, the privacy interests discussed above do not appear \nto represent a post hoc rationalization for Part I.  See Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 533 (requiring that a justification be “genuine, not \nhypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation”).  \n57 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 57 of 83\n\nPlaintiffs  contend  that  Part  I  “effectively  seeks  to  define \ntransgender individuals out of existence and shut them out from \npublic life.”34  (Doc. 22 at 35.)  As a preliminary matter, it is \nhard to infer legislative intent based on the current record which, \nas noted above, contains little information about the legislative \nprocess leading to HB2’s passage.  The preliminary record does \ncontain  a  few  examples  of  objectionable  statements  by  some \nlegislators in media outlets, though these statements generally \nexpress hostility toward “the liberal agenda” and the “homosexual \ncommunity” rather than transgender individuals.  (See, e.g., Doc. \n23-7 at 2; Doc. 23-15 at 2.)  But the record also contains many \nstatements,  some  by  these  same  legislators  and  others  by \nlegislative leaders and Governor McCrory, reflecting an apparently \ngenuine concern for the privacy and safety of North Carolina’s \ncitizens.  (See, e.g., Doc. 23–7 at 2 (stating that the Charlotte \nordinance “has created a major public safety issue”); Doc. 23-15 \nat 2 (“The Charlotte ordinance just violates, to me, all basic \nhuman principles of privacy and it just has so many unintended \nconsequences.”);  Doc.  23–16  at  2  (“While  special  sessions  are \ncostly, we cannot put a price  tag  on the safety  of  women and \nchildren.”); id. at 3 (“We need to respect the privacy of women \n                     \n34 It should go without saying that Part I, which regulates access to \npublic bathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities, neither defines \ntransgender  individuals  “out  of  existence”  nor  prevents  them  from \nparticipating in public life.   \n \n58 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 58 of 83\n\nand  children  and  men  in  a  very  private  place,  and  that’s  our \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms.”).)    In  light  of  the  many \ncontemporaneous statements by State leaders regarding privacy and \nthe substantial relationship between Part I and the State’s privacy \ninterests, Plaintiffs have not clearly shown that privacy was an \nafterthought  or  a  pretext  invented  after  the  fact  solely  for \nlitigation purposes.  Nor does the court infer improper motive \nsimply  from  the  fact  that  Part  I  negatively  impacts  some \ntransgender individuals.35  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 631 (“[M]ost \nlegislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting \ndisadvantage to various groups or persons.”).     \nIn sum, Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent support \nthe  conclusion  that  physiological  differences  between  men  and \nwomen give rise to the privacy interests that justify segregating \nbathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities on the basis of \nsex.  In addition, Plaintiffs admit that the vast majority of birth \ncertificates  accurately  reflect  an  individual’s  external \ngenitalia.  Although the correlation between genitalia and the sex \nlisted on a person’s birth certificate is not perfect in every \ncase,  there  is  certainly  a  reasonable  fit  between  these \ncharacteristics, which is what the law requires.  See Staten, 666 \n                     \n35 Of course, not all transgender individuals are negatively impacted by \nPart  I  because  some  may  be  able  to  change  the  sex  on  their  birth \ncertificates, with or without sex reassignment surgery, and others may \nchoose  to  use  bathrooms  or  other  facilities  that  accord  with  their \nbiological sex, whether or not they suffer dysphoria as a result. \n59 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 59 of 83\n\nF.3d at 162 (“In other words, the fit needs to be reasonable; a \nperfect fit is not required.”).  At this preliminary stage, and in \nlight  of  existing  case  law,  Plaintiffs  have  not  made  a  clear \nshowing that they are likely to succeed on their Equal Protection \nclaim. \n \nii. Due Process \nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State may “deprive \nany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of \nlaw.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  The Supreme Court has long \nheld that, in addition to requiring the government to follow fair \nprocedures when taking certain actions, the Due Process Clause \nalso “bar[s] certain government actions regardless of the fairness \nof the procedures used to implement them.”  Daniels v. Williams, \n474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986).  As a result, a law that burdens a \nfundamental  right  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny  and  cannot  be \nupheld unless the State demonstrates that it is narrowly tailored \nto serve a compelling interest.  See Carey v. Population Servs. \nInt’l, 431 U.S. 678, 686 (1977); Walls v. City of Petersburg, 895 \nF.2d 188, 192 (4th Cir. 1990).  By contrast a law that does not \nburden  a  fundamental  right  is  subject  only  to  rational  basis \nreview, and a court must uphold such a law “so long as it bears a \nrational relation to some legitimate end.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at \n631. \nFor the reasons explained above, the court concludes that \n60 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 60 of 83\n\nPart  I  is  substantially  related  to  an  important  government \ninterest.  Because Part I passes intermediate scrutiny, the law \nnecessarily clears the lower hurdle of rational basis review.  See \nOutdoor Media Grp., Inc. v. City of Beaumont, 506 F.3d 895, 907 \n(9th Cir. 2007); Contest Promotions, LLC v. City and Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 100 F. Supp. 3d 835, 849 (N.D. Cal. 2015).  As a result, \nin order to warrant preliminary relief, Plaintiffs must make a \nclear showing that Part I burdens a fundamental right and therefore \ntriggers strict scrutiny. \nPlaintiffs argue that Part I burdens two separate fundamental \nrights.  First, they argue that Part I burdens a fundamental right \nto informational privacy by forcing transgender individuals to use \nbathrooms  in  which  they  will  appear  out  of  place,  thereby \ndisclosing their transgender status to third parties.  Second, \nthey argue that Part I violates a right to refuse unwanted medical \ntreatment because many States, including North Carolina, require \ntransgender individuals to undergo sex reassignment surgery before \nchanging the sex on their birth certificates.  Each argument will \nbe addressed in turn. \n \n(a) Informational Privacy \nThe  constitutional  right  to  privacy  protects,  among  other \nthings,  an  individual’s  “interest  in  avoiding  disclosure  of \npersonal matters.”  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599 (1977).  “The \nright to privacy, however, is not absolute.”  Walls, 895 F.2d at \n61 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 61 of 83\n\n192.    Instead,  the  constitutional  right  to  privacy  is  only \nimplicated when State action compels disclosure of information of \na “fundamental” nature.  Id.  “The more intimate or personal the \ninformation, the more justified is the expectation that it will \nnot be subject to public scrutiny.”  Id.  The Fourth Circuit has \nheld that, as a “first step” in determining whether a particular \ncategory of information is entitled to constitutional protection, \ncourts  should  examine  whether  the  information  “is  within  an \nindividual’s reasonable expectations of confidentiality.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  a  person’s  transgender  status \nconstitutes sensitive medical information and that this type of \ninformation is subject to constitutional protection.  They cite \nvarious cases in which courts held that information qualifies for \nconstitutional protection when it is of a sexual, personal, or \nhumiliating nature, or when the release of the information could \nsubject  the  person  to  a  risk  of  bodily  harm.    See  Powell  v. \nSchriver,  175  F.3d  107,  111  (2d  Cir.  1999)  (“[T]he  right  to \nconfidentiality  includes  the  right  to  protection  regarding \ninformation about the state of one’s health.”) (quoting Doe v. \nCity of New York, 15 F.3d 264, 267 (2d Cir. 1994)); Love v. Johnson, \n146 F. Supp. 3d 848, 853 (E.D. Mich. 2015).  These courts concluded \nthat  an  individual’s  transgender  status  qualifies  for \nconstitutional  protection  because  such  information  is  of  a \nprivate, sexual nature and disclosure of this information could \n62 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 62 of 83\n\nsubject  a  transgender  person  to  ridicule,  harassment,  or  even \nbodily harm.  See Powell, 175 F.3d at 111 (“Like HIV status . . . \ntranssexualism is the unusual condition that is likely to provoke \nboth an intense desire to preserve one’s medical confidentiality, \nas well as hostility and intolerance from others.”); Love, 146 F. \nSupp. 3d at 856; see also K.L. v. Alaska, Dep’t of Admin., Div. of \nMotor Vehicles, No. 3AN-11-05341, 2012 WL 2685183, at *6 (Alaska \nSuper.  Ct.  Mar.  12,  2012)  (concluding  that  an  individual’s \ntransgender status qualifies for privacy protection under Alaska \nlaw).  In Love, for example, the court considered a Michigan law \nthat prevented individuals from changing the sex on their driver’s \nlicense.36  146 F. Supp. 3d at 856–57.  The court concluded that \nthis  policy  burdened  Due  Process  privacy  interests  because  it \nforced transgender individuals to tacitly reveal their transgender \nstatus whenever they displayed their driver’s licenses to others.  \nId.; see also K.L., 2012 WL 2685183 at *4–7 (same).   \nNone of these cases applied Fourth Circuit law, however, and \nthe Fourth Circuit’s decision in Walls casts doubt on the validity \nof these cases in this circuit.  In Walls, a public employee was \nfired after refusing to complete a background check that included \nquestions  about her  prior  marriages,  divorces,  debts,  criminal \n                     \n36 Notably, the policy in Love only applied to individuals who sought to \nchange the sex on an existing driver’s license; Michigan apparently did \nnot require individuals to present a birth certificate to support their \nclaimed sex when initially obtaining a license.  Id. at 851–52 & n.2. \n63 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 63 of 83\n\nhistory, and sexual relationships with same-sex partners.  895 \nF.2d at 190.  The employee brought an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nagainst her employer, claiming that the questionnaire violated her \nright to privacy.  Walls, 895 F.2d at 189–92.  The Fourth Circuit \nexplained that the “right to privacy protects only information \nwith respect to which the individual has a reasonable expectation \nof privacy.”  Id. at 193.  The court therefore concluded that the \nright to privacy did not protect the information sought in the \nagency’s questionnaire, including questions about prior marriages, \ndivorces, and children, “to the extent that this information is \nfreely available in public records.”  Id. \nWalls  suggests  that  Part  I  does  not  burden  a  fundamental \nprivacy  interest,  at  least  under  current  Fourth  Circuit  law.  \nPlaintiffs argue that Part I discloses an individual’s transgender \nstatus  to  third  parties  by  revealing  the  sex  on  their  birth \ncertificates  through  their  choice  of  bathroom;  when  a \nstereotypically-feminine  appearing  individual  uses  a  men’s \nbathroom,  Plaintiffs  argue,  third  parties  will  know  that  the \nindividual has a male birth certificate and infer that the person \nis transgender.  (See Doc. 9 at ¶¶ 223–24.)  But pursuant to Walls, \nindividuals have no constitutionally-protected privacy interest in \ninformation that is freely available in public records.  895 F.2d \nat 193.  And although the parties have not addressed this issue, \nthe sex listed on an individual’s birth certificate appears to be \n64 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 64 of 83\n\nfreely available in public records, at least if the individual was \nborn  in  North  Carolina.    See  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 130A-93(b) \n(providing that all birth data collected by the State qualifies as \npublic records except for the names, addresses, and social security \nnumbers  of  children  and  parents);  see  also  id.  § 132-1(b) \n(providing that all public records “are the property of the people” \nand requiring that the public be given access to such information \n“free or at minimal cost unless otherwise specifically provided by \nlaw”).   \nAs  a  result,  regardless  of  whether  the  court  finds  the \nreasoning in Love and K.L. persuasive, the sex listed on a person’s \nbirth certificate does not appear to qualify for constitutional \nprotection under Walls.  Plaintiffs cite general statements about \nprivacy from Walls, but they overlook the obvious question of why \nthe rule the court actually applied in that case should not govern \nthis case as well.  (See Doc. 22 at 36–38; Doc. 73 at 36–37.)  It \nis possible that, with further development, Plaintiffs may be able \nto sufficiently distinguish Walls and demonstrate that the rule \nfrom that case should not apply outside of the employment context.  \nFor example, the policies at issue in Love and K.L. arguably have \nmore  in  common  with  Part  I  than  Walls,  which  dealt  with  an \nemployment background check – a situation in which a third party \ncan reasonably be expected to know the individual’s name, address, \nand other identifying information that would make a public records \n65 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 65 of 83\n\nsearch more practicable.  Walls, 895 F.2d at 193–95.   \nOn the other hand, there are also significant distinctions \nbetween this case and the cases cited by Plaintiffs.  Unlike Part \nI,  most  of  Plaintiffs’  cases  involved  State  actors  who \nintentionally  revealed  or  threatened  to  reveal  private \ninformation.  See, e.g., Powell, 175 F.3d at 109–11 (prison guard \nopenly discussed an inmate’s transgender status in the presence of \nother inmates); Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, 232 F.3d 190, \n192, 196 (3d Cir. 2000) (police officer threatened to tell an \narrestee’s family that the arrestee was gay).  Even Love and K.L., \nPlaintiffs’ most factually-analogous cases, challenged policies \ngoverning  the  modification  of  State  documents  rather  than  the \ncircumstances in which a State may rely on those documents.  Love \n146 F. Supp. 3d at 856; K.L., 2012 WL 2685183 at *4–8.  Love held \nthat Michigan must allow transgender individuals to change the sex \non their driver’s license so that they would not have to reveal \ntheir transgender status during traffic stops; plaintiffs did not \nargue,  and  the  court  did  not  hold,  that  the  State  should  be \nenjoined  from  asking  drivers  for  identification  during  traffic \nstops.  See 146 F. Supp. 3d at 856; see also K.L., 2012 WL 2685183 \nat *4–8 (same).   \nUnlike the plaintiffs in Love and K.L., Plaintiffs challenge \nNorth  Carolina’s  ability  to  use  birth  certificates  as  an \nidentifying document in the context of bathrooms, showers, and \n66 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 66 of 83\n\nother  facilities,  rather  than  its  rules  for  altering  the \ninformation  contained  in  the  birth  certificate  itself.    This \nhighlights a potential conceptual difficulty with Plaintiffs’ Due \nProcess theories.  Even under Part I, an individual’s choice of \nbathroom does not directly or necessarily disclose whether that \nperson is transgender; it merely discloses the sex listed on the \nperson’s  birth  certificate.    Part  I  does  not  disclose  medical \ninformation about any persons whose gender identity aligns with \ntheir birth certificate, either because they are not transgender \nor because they have successfully changed their birth certificate \nto match their gender identity (with or without sex reassignment \nsurgery).    Nor  does  Part  I  disclose  medical  information  about \ntransgender  individuals  whose  name,  appearance,  or  other \ncharacteristics  do  not  readily  identify  their  gender  identity.  \nPart  I  could  only  disclose  an  individual’s  transgender  status \ninasmuch as third parties are able to infer as much in light of \nthe person’s birth certificate and appearance.  Thus, it is not \nreadily  apparent  to  what  extent  any  Due  Process  concerns  are \nattributable to Part I as opposed to the laws that govern the \nmodification of birth certificates.  \nIn light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs have not clearly shown \nthat  they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their \ninformational  privacy  claim.    See  Winter,  555  U.S.  at  20–22 \n(stating that a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy \n67 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 67 of 83\n\nthat may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff \nis entitled to such relief” (emphasis added)).  The law in this \narea  is  substantially  underdeveloped,  however,  and  the  parties \ndevoted relatively little attention to this claim both in their \nbriefs and at the hearing on this matter.  Although Plaintiffs \nhave not demonstrated that they are entitled to preliminary relief \non this claim, their arguments and authorities raise substantial \nquestions that merit additional consideration.  As a result, the \ncourt  will  reserve  ruling  on  Plaintiffs’  informational  privacy \nclaim  at  this  time  so  that  the  parties  may  submit  additional \nbriefing according to the schedule outlined in Section III below.    \n \n(b) Unwanted Medical Treatment \nPlaintiffs  also  contend  that  Part  I  violates  transgender \nindividuals’  constitutional  right  to  refuse  unwanted  medical \ntreatment because North Carolina and many other States require sex \nreassignment surgery before the sex on a person’s birth certificate \nmay be changed.  (Doc. 9 ¶¶ 228–34; Doc. 22 at 39.) \nThe parties’ arguments on this issue are even less developed \nthan those pertaining to informational privacy, with just three \nparagraphs devoted to the issue in the parties’ principal briefs \ncombined.  (See Doc. 22 at 38–39; Doc. 55 at 18.)  Plaintiffs rely \nalmost exclusively on United States v. Charters, 829 F.2d 479 (4th \nCir. 1987).  In Charters, the Fourth Circuit held that a mentally \nill prisoner had a Due Process interest in refusing the State’s \n68 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 68 of 83\n\nefforts to medicate him with antipsychotic drugs against his will.  \nId. at 490–500.  In reaching this decision, the court applied \nprinciples  derived  from  the  “rights  to  freedom  from  physical \ninvasion and freedom of thought as well as the right to privacy \nprotected by the Constitution and the common law.”  Id. at 490.  \nFrom these principles, the court observed, “The right to refuse \nmedical treatment has been specifically recognized as a subject of \nconstitutional protection.”  Id. at 491. \nGovernments assuredly must meet heightened scrutiny before \nforcibly medicating prisoners, or any citizens for that matter, \nagainst their will.  But Plaintiffs have not shown how this holding \napplies to Part I, which does not address medical treatment at \nall.  True, Part I may require some transgender individuals (who \notherwise do not benefit from the court’s injunction as to Title \nIX facilities) to undergo potentially unwanted medical treatment \nif they wish to access public bathrooms, showers, and other similar \nfacilities that align with their gender identity.  But they are \nfree to use facilities that align with their biological sex, and \nthey may have access to single-user facilities.  As much as one \nsympathizes with the plight of these transgender individuals, this \ndegree  of  “compulsion”  is  far  removed  from  the  situation  in \nCharters, where a captive prisoner was strapped down and forced to \nsubmit to medication against his will.  See Charters, 829 F.2d at \n482–84.  If the Due Process Clause were implicated any time an \n69 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 69 of 83\n\nindividual must undergo medical treatment in order to access a \ndesired benefit or service, it would cast serious doubts on a wide \nvariety of laws.  See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. § 130A-155 (requiring \nschools and child care facilities to ensure that children have \nreceived appropriate vaccines before accepting them as students); \n19A N.C. Admin. Code § 3B.0201(a)(3) (requiring some individuals \nto wear corrective lenses in order to obtain a driver’s license).37   \nAt a minimum, further development of Plaintiffs’ argument is \nnecessary before the court can determine whether Charters prevents \nthe State from enforcing Part I.  As with Plaintiffs’ informational \nprivacy claim, the court will reserve ruling to give the parties \nan  opportunity  to  submit  additional  briefing  on  this  claim  in \naccordance with the schedule outlined in Section III below.   \n \n2. Irreparable Harm \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must also show that \nit  is  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of \npreliminary relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Irreparable injury \nmust  be  both  imminent  and  likely;  speculation  about  potential \nfuture injuries is insufficient.  See id. at 22.  \nOn the current record, the individual transgender Plaintiffs \n                     \n37 Here, too, as with the informational privacy claim, Plaintiffs’ real \nproblem appears to be various States’ inflexible rules for changing one’s \nsex on a birth certificate, in so far as Part I permits transgender users \nwho did not have any surgery to use facilities matching their gender \nidentity as long as their birth certificate has been changed – an issue \nthe parties have not adequately addressed.  \n70 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 70 of 83\n\nhave clearly shown that they will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief.  All three transgender Plaintiffs \nsubmitted declarations stating that single occupancy bathrooms and \nother similar facilities are generally unavailable at UNC and other \npublic agencies.  (See Doc. 22-4 ¶¶ 18–20; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 27; Doc. \n22-9  ¶¶ 24–25.)    In  fact,  two  of  the  individual  transgender \nPlaintiffs indicate that they are not aware of any single occupancy \nfacilities in the buildings in which their classes are held.  (Doc. \n22-8 ¶ 27; Doc. 22-9 ¶¶ 24–25.)  Part I therefore interferes with \nthese  individuals’  ability  to  participate  in  their  work  and \neducational activities.  (See Doc. 22-4 ¶ 21; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 27; Doc. \n22-9 ¶ 24.)  As a result, some of these Plaintiffs limit their \nfluid  intake  and  resist  the  urge  to  use  a  bathroom  whenever \npossible.  (Doc. 22-4 ¶ 21; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 32.)  Such behavior can \nlead  to  serious  medical  consequences,  such  as  urinary  tract \ninfections, constipation, and kidney disease.  (Doc. 22-16 at 3–\n4.)  This concern is not merely speculative; there is evidence \nthat one of the individual transgender Plaintiffs has already begun \nto suffer medical consequences from behavioral changes prompted by \nPart I.  (Doc. 73-1 at 1–2.)  \nIn their response to Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendants suggest \nthat the individual transgender Plaintiffs’ claims of irreparable \nharm  are  speculative  and  exaggerated,  but  Defendants  have  not \npresented any evidence to contradict Plaintiffs’ evidence.  (See \n71 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 71 of 83\n\nDoc. 61 at 22–26.)  Therefore, on this record, the court has no \nbasis for doubting Plaintiffs’ assertions that they cannot use \nmultiple occupancy facilities that match their birth certificates \nfor  fear  of  harassment  and  violence,  that  single  occupancy \nfacilities are not reasonably available to them, and that they are \nat a serious risk of suffering negative health consequences as a \nresult.  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs delayed in filing their \nmotion for preliminary injunction seven weeks after the passage of \nHB2.  (Doc. 61 at 23.)  In some circumstances, a delay in requesting \npreliminary relief can be relevant to the irreparable harm inquiry.  \nSee, e.g., Static Control Components, Inc. v. Future Graphics, \nLLC, No. 1:06cv730, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36474, at *7–9 (M.D.N.C. \nMay  11,  2007)  (finding  that  an  employer’s  eight-week  delay  in \nseeking to prevent a former employee from working for a competitor \nweighed against a finding of irreparable harm); Fairbanks Capital \nCorp. v. Kenney, 303 F. Supp. 2d 583, 590–91 (D. Md. 2003) (finding \nan eleven-month delay in bringing a trademark infringement suit to \nbe reasonable under the circumstances).  Here, however, HB2 was \npassed on an expedited schedule, and Plaintiffs doubtlessly needed \nsome time to compile the more than sixty documents they submitted \nto  support  their  motion,  including  exhibits,  declarations  from \nfact witnesses, and the opinions of expert witnesses.  In addition, \nthe legal landscape regarding HB2’s enforcement remained in flux \n72 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 72 of 83\n\nimmediately after the laws’ passage.  (See, e.g., Doc. 23-24; Doc. \n23-28.)  Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs’ minimal delay in \nseeking  preliminary  relief  does  not  undermine  their  claims \nregarding irreparable harm.   \nFinally,  the  court  notes  that  similar  facts  were  deemed \nsufficient to support a finding of irreparable harm in G.G.  See \nG.G., 2016 WL 3581852 at *1; G.G., 822 F.3d at 727–29 (Davis, J., \nconcurring).  The court therefore concludes that the individual \ntransgender Plaintiffs have made a clear showing that they are \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief. \n \n3. Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nIn  addition  to  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  and \nirreparable  harm,  those  seeking  preliminary  relief  must  also \ndemonstrate that the balance of equities tips in their favor and \nthat an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter, 555 U.S. at \n20.  On the current record, both favor entry of an injunction. \nThe balance of equities favors the entry of an injunction.  \nOne noteworthy feature of this case is that all parties claim that \nthey want to preserve North Carolina law as it existed before the \nlaw was enacted; they simply disagree about the contours of that \npre-HB2 legal regime.  (See Doc. 103 at 6, 15–21, 65–71, 74–90, \n96–102; Doc. 9 ¶¶ 166–68.)  For the reasons discussed above, the \ncourt concludes that Part I does not accurately restore the status \n73 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 73 of 83\n\nquo ante in North Carolina, at least as it existed in the years \nimmediately  preceding  2016.    While  Part  I  reiterates  the \nmale/female  distinction  for  the  vast  majority  of  persons,  it \nimposes  a  new  restriction  that  effectively  prohibits  State \nagencies  from  providing  flexible,  case-by-case  accommodations \nregarding  the  use  of  bathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar \nfacilities for transgender individuals where feasible.38  See HB 2 \n§§ 1.2–1.3.    Because  Defendants  do  not  claim  to  have  had  any \nproblems with the pre-2016 regime (Doc. 103 at 65–71, 74–90, 96–\n102), the entry of an injunction should not work any hardship on \nthem.    By  contrast,  the  failure  to  enjoin  Part  I  would  cause \nsubstantial  hardship  to  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs, \ndisrupting their lives. \nFor similar reasons, the court concludes that an injunction \nis in the public interest.  Of course, every individual has “a \nlegitimate and important interest in [ensuring] that his or her \nnude or partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts \nare not involuntarily exposed.”  G.G., 822 F.3d at 723 (citations \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  The dispute in this case \ncenters on facilities of the most intimate nature, and the State \n                     \n38 For  this  reason,  the  preliminary  injunction  in  this  case  is  a \nprohibitory injunction and is not subject to the heightened standard \nthat applies to mandatory injunctions.  See Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d \n307, 319 (4th Cir. 2013) (“Prohibitory preliminary injunctions aim to \nmaintain the status quo and prevent irreparable harm while a lawsuit \nremains pending.”). \n74 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 74 of 83\n\nclearly has an important interest in protecting the privacy rights \nof all citizens in such facilities.  See, e.g., Virginia, 518 U.S. \nat 550 n.19 (stating that separate facilities in coeducational \ninstitutions are “necessary to afford members of each sex privacy \nfrom the other sex”); Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 232 (noting “society’s \nundisputed approval of separate public restrooms for men and women \nbased  on  privacy  concerns”).    The  privacy  and  safety  concerns \nraised by Defendants are significant, and this is particularly so \nas they pertain to the protection of minors.  See, e.g., Beard, \n402 F.3d at 604 (“Students of course have a significant privacy \ninterest in their unclothed bodies.”).  At the hearing on the \npresent  motion,  Plaintiffs  acknowledged  that  the  State  has  a \nlegitimate interest in protecting the privacy of its citizens, \nparticularly  minors  and  students,  and  that  sex-segregated \nbathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar  facilities  serve  this \ninterest.  (See Doc. 103 at 15–19.)   \nBut  transgender  individuals  are  not  exempted  from  such \nprivacy and safety rights.  The current record indicates that many \npublic agencies have become increasingly open to accommodating the \ninterests of transgender individuals as society has evolved over \ntime.  (See, e.g., Doc. 22-19 ¶¶ 8–9.)  This practice of case-by-\ncase  accommodation,  while  developing,  appears  to  have  gained \nacceptance in many places across North Carolina over the last few \nyears.  (See, e.g., Doc. 22-4 ¶ 15; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 19; Doc. 22-9 \n75 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 75 of 83\n\n¶¶ 15, 19–20.)  And the preliminary record contains uncontested \nevidence that these practices allowed the individual transgender \nPlaintiffs to use bathrooms and other facilities consistent with \ntheir  gender  identity  for  an  extended  period  of  time  without \ncausing any known infringement on the privacy rights of others. \n(See Doc. 22-4 ¶ 30; Doc. 22-8 ¶ 25; Doc. 22-9 ¶ 20.) \nIn fact, rather than protect privacy, it appears at least \nequally  likely  that  denying  an  injunction  will  create  privacy \nproblems,  as  it  would  require  the  individual  transgender \nPlaintiffs,  who  outwardly  appear  as  the  sex  with  which  they \nidentify,  to  enter  facilities  designated  for  the  opposite  sex \n(e.g., requiring stereotypically-masculine appearing transgender \nindividuals to use women’s bathrooms), thus prompting unnecessary \nalarm and suspicion.  (See, e.g., Doc. 22-9 ¶ 28 (describing one \nstudent’s  experiences  being  “screamed  at,  shoved,  slapped,  and \ntold  to  get  out”  when  using  bathrooms  that  did  not  match  the \nstudent’s  gender  identity.)    As  counsel  for  Governor  McCrory \ncandidly acknowledged, even if Part I remains in effect, “some \ntransgender individuals will continue to use the bathroom that \nthey always used and nobody will know.”  (Doc. 103 at 70.)   \nFinally,  the  argument  for  safety  and  privacy  concerns \nproffered  by  the  State  as  to  transgender  users  are  somewhat \nundermined here by the structure of Part I itself.  Unlike the \npolicy in G.G., which contained no exceptions, Part I permits some \n76 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 76 of 83\n\ntransgender  individuals  to  use  bathrooms,  showers,  and  other \nfacilities that do not correspond with their external genitalia.  \nThis  is  so  because  some  States  do  not  permit  transgender \nindividuals to change their birth certificates even after having \nsex  reassignment  surgery,  see,  e.g.,  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 68-3-\n203(d),  while  others  allow  modification  of  birth  certificates \nwithout such surgery, see, e.g., Md. Code, Health-Gen § 4-211.  In \nthis regard, Part I’s emphasis on birth certificates elevates form \nover substance to some degree as to some transgender users. \nAs  for  safety,  Defendants  argue  that  separating  facility \nusers  by  biological  sex  serves  prophylactically  to  avoid  the \nopportunity for sexual predators to prey on persons in vulnerable \nplaces.  However, the individual transgender Plaintiffs have used \nfacilities corresponding with their gender identity for over a \nyear without posing a safety threat to anyone.  (See Doc. 22-4 \n¶¶ 15, 30; Doc. 22-8 ¶¶ 19, 25; Doc. 22-9 ¶¶ 15, 19–20.)  Moreover, \non  the  current  record,  there  is  no  evidence  that  transgender \nindividuals overall are any more likely to engage in predatory \nbehaviors than other segments of the population.  In light of this, \nthere is little reason to believe that allowing the individual \ntransgender  Plaintiffs  to  use  partitioned,  multiple  occupancy \nbathrooms corresponding with their gender identities, as well as \nUNC to seek to accommodate use of similar showers and changing \nfacilities,  will  pose  any  threat  to  public  safety,  which  will \n77 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 77 of 83\n\ncontinue to be protected by the sustained validity of peeping, \nindecent exposure, and trespass laws.  And although Defendants \nargue that a preliminary injunction will thwart enforcement of \nsuch safety laws by allowing non-transgender predators to exploit \nthe opportunity to cross-dress and prey on others (Doc. 55 at 4–\n5), the unrefuted evidence in the current record suggests that \njurisdictions  that  have  adopted  accommodating  bathroom  access \npolicies have not observed subsequent increases in crime, (see \nDoc. 22-10 at 6–10; Doc. 22-13).   \nFinally, the court acknowledges that “any time a State is \nenjoined  by  a  court  from  effectuating  statutes  enacted  by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury.”  New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 \nU.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).  In this case, \nhowever, this concern lessened by the continued validity of Parts \nII and III of HB2, which serve the State’s ostensible goal of \npreempting the Charlotte ordinance and maintaining the law as it \nexisted before March 2016.  The State acknowledges that it had no \nproblems with that pre-2016 legal regime.  (Doc. 103 at 65–71, 74–\n90, 96–102.) \nIn sum, the court has no reason to believe that an injunction \nreturning to the state of affairs as it existed before March 2016 \nwould  pose  a  privacy  or  safety  risk  for  North  Carolinians, \ntransgender or otherwise.  It is in the public interest to enforce \n78 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 78 of 83\n\nfederal anti-discrimination laws in a fashion that also maintains \nlong-standing State laws designed to protect privacy and safety.  \nOn this record, allowing UNC to permit the transgender Plaintiffs \nto use multiple occupancy, partitioned restrooms corresponding to \ntheir  gender  identity,  and  to  seek  flexible  accommodation  for \nchanging rooms and other facilities, therefore serves the public \ninterest. \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ motion seeks to preliminarily enjoin Defendants \n“from enforcing Part I of House Bill 2.”  (Doc. 21 at 3; see also \nDoc. 22 at 44–45.)   As a result, the issue currently before the \ncourt is whether Title IX or the Constitution prohibits Defendants \nfrom  enforcing  HB2’s  exclusion  of  transgender  individuals  from \nmultiple-occupancy  bathrooms,  showers,  and  other  similar \nfacilities under all circumstances based solely on the designation \nof “male” or “female” on their birth certificate.   \nFor  the  reasons  stated,  applicable  Fourth  Circuit  law \nrequires that DOE’s guidance defining “sex” to mean gender identity \nbe accorded controlling weight when interpreting DOE’s Title IX \nregulations.    Because  Part  I  of  HB2  prevents  transgender \nindividuals from using multiple-occupancy bathrooms and similar \nfacilities  based  solely  on  the  gender  listed  on  their  birth \ncertificate, it necessarily violates DOE’s guidance and cannot be \nenforced.  As for Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, Plaintiffs \n79 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 79 of 83\n\nhave not made a clear showing they are likely to succeed on their \nEqual Protection claim, and the court reserves ruling on the Due \nProcess claims pending further briefing from the parties.       \nThe Title IX claim currently before the court is brought by \nthe individual transgender Plaintiffs on their own behalf; the \ncurrent complaint asserts no claim for class relief or any Title \nIX claim by ACLU-NC on behalf of its members.  (Doc. 9 ¶¶ 235–\n243.)39    Consequently,  the  relief  granted  now  is  as  to  the \nindividual transgender Plaintiffs.   \nThe  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs  have  not  sought  an \norder  guaranteeing  them  access  to  any  specific  facility.    The \ncourt’s  order  will  return  the  parties  to  the  status  quo  ante \nexisting immediately before the passage of Part I of HB2, wherein \npublic agencies accommodated the individual transgender Plaintiffs \non a case-by-case basis, rather than applying a blanket rule to \nall people in all facilities under all circumstances.  Plaintiffs \nhave no complaint with UNC’s pre-HB2 policy; Defendants, in turn, \ndo not contend that it caused any significant privacy or safety \nconcerns.  Such an order is also consistent with the DOE opinion \nletter, which states that schools “generally” must treat students \nconsistent with their gender identity.  (Doc. 23-29 at 3.)  As a \n                     \n39 Although Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint after the hearing \non the present motion (Doc. 116), the motion to amend has not been \nresolved.   \n80 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 80 of 83\n\nresult, the court does not decide how Defendants should apply DOE’s \nguidance in all situations and circumstances.  Suffice it to say \nthat for the time being, UNC is not constrained from accommodating \nthe individual transgender Plaintiffs through appropriate means \nthat  accord  with  DOE  guidance  and  recognize  the  unique \ncircumstances of each case, just as it apparently did for several \nyears prior to HB2.  In doing so, UNC should be mindful of North \nCarolina’s trespass, peeping, and indecent exposure laws, which \nprotect  the  privacy  and  safety  of  all  citizens,  regardless  of \ngender identity.  In short, UNC may not apply HB2’s one-size-fits-\nall approach to what must be a case-by-case inquiry.40   \nIT  IS  THEREFORE  ORDERED  that  Plaintiffs’  motion  for \npreliminary injunction (Doc. 21) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART, as follows:  \n \n(1) The  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs’  motion  for \npreliminary  injunction  on  their  Title  IX  claim  is \nGRANTED.    The  University  of  North  Carolina,  its \nofficers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, \nand all other persons acting in concert or participation \nwith them are hereby ENJOINED from enforcing Part I of \n                     \n40 To  the  extent  the  individual  transgender  Plaintiffs  assert  an \nunqualified right to use all multiple occupancy bathrooms, showers, and \nchanging rooms under all circumstances (see Doc. 9 at 56), that issue \nis not currently before the court.  Whether it will be at a later stage \nin this case, or as part of the United States’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction in the 425 case, remains for later determination. \n81 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 81 of 83\n\nHB2 against the individual transgender Plaintiffs until \nfurther order of the court. \n \n(2) Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on their \nEqual Protection claim is DENIED without prejudice to a \nfinal determination on the merits. \n \n(3) The  court  reserves  ruling  on  Plaintiffs’  motion  for \npreliminary injunction on their Due Process claims.  If \nPlaintiffs wish to submit additional briefing on these \nclaims, they must do so no later than September 9, 2016.  \nAny response briefs must be filed no later than September \n23, 2016, and any reply briefs must be filed no later \nthan October 7, 2016.  Although the parties may address \nany matter relevant to the Due Process claims in their \nbriefs,  the  court  is  particularly  interested  in  the \nfollowing  questions:  (1)  whether  the  sex  on  an \nindividual’s birth certificate is freely available in \npublic records in North Carolina and other States and, \nif so, whether individuals have a Due Process privacy \ninterest in such information; and (2) the degree to which \na law in general, and Part I in particular, must burden \na fundamental right in order to warrant strict scrutiny.  \nPlaintiffs’ initial brief and any response briefs may \nnot exceed twenty pages per side, and Plaintiffs’ reply \nmay  not  exceed  ten  pages.  If  the  parties  desire \n82 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 127   Filed 08/26/16   Page 82 of 83\n\nadditional  oral  argument  regarding  Plaintiffs’  Due \nProcess claims, any hearing will be combined with the \nconsolidated preliminary injunction hearing and trial on \nthe merits in the 425 case. \n \n   /s/   Thomas D.

Laws 3, commonly known as House Bill 2 (“HB2”).  Acting in \ntheir official capacities, Phil Berger, the President pro tempore \nof the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, the Speaker of the \nNorth  Carolina  House  of  Representatives  (collectively,  the \n“proposed intervenors”), seek intervention as of right pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), or, in the alternative, \npermissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b).  (Doc. 33.)  For \nthe reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted, and the \nlegislators will be permitted to intervene permissively. \n \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe North Carolina General Assembly passed HB 2 on March 23, \n2016, and Governor Patrick L. McCrory signed the bill into law \nlater that day.  2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 3.  Among other things, HB2 \n \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 1 of 8\n\nstates that multiple occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, \nincluding  those  managed  by  local  boards  of  education,  must  be \n“designated for and only used by persons based on their biological \nsex.”    Id.    The  law  also  sets  statewide  nondiscrimination \nstandards, preempting local and municipal ordinances that conflict \nwith these standards.  Id. \nAlmost immediately, HB2 sparked multiple overlapping federal \nlawsuits.  On March 28, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union \nof North Carolina, Equality North Carolina, and several individual \nplaintiffs  filed  this  action,  alleging  that  HB2  discriminates \nagainst transgender, gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals on the \nbasis  of  sex,  sexual  orientation,  and  transgender  status  in \nviolation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (“Title IX”), as well as the Equal Protection \nand Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  (Doc. 1.)1   \nOn May 9, 2016, the United States filed a lawsuit in this \ncourt  against  the  State,  Governor  McCrory  (in  his  official \ncapacity),  the  North  Carolina  Department  of  Public  Safety \n(“NCDPS”), the University of North Carolina, and the University of \nNorth  Carolina  Board  of  Governors,  seeking  a  declaration  that \ncompliance with HB2’s provisions relating to multiple-occupancy \n                     \n1 Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 21, 2016.  (Doc. 9.) \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 2 of 8\n\nbathrooms and changing facilities constitutes sex discrimination \nin  violation  of  Title  IX,  the  Violence  Against  Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013, 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13) (“VAWA”), \nand Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e \net  seq.  (“Title  VII”),  and  requesting  an  injunction  against \nenforcement of the law.  (Doc. 1 in case no. 1:16CV425 (the “425 \ncase”).)   \nThat same day, State officials filed two separate declaratory \nactions  in  the  Eastern  District  of  North  Carolina.    Governor \nMcCrory and NCDPS filed an action against the United States and \nthe  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”),  seeking  a \ndeclaration that HB2 does not violate Title VII or VAWA (case no. \n5:16cv238 (the “238 case”).  Meanwhile, the proposed intervenors \nfiled their own lawsuit against DOJ, seeking a declaration that \nHB2 does not violate Title VII, Title IX, or VAWA, as well as \ndeclarations  that  DOJ  had  violated  both  the  Administrative \nProcedure  Act  and  various  constitutional  provisions  (case  no. \n5:16cv240  (the  “240  case”).    Finally,  on  May  10,  2016,  an \norganization named North Carolinians for Privacy filed its own \naction in support of HB2 in the Eastern District of North Carolina, \nseeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  DOJ  and  the \nUnited States Department of Education related to Title IX and VAWA \n(case no. 5:16cv245 (the “245 case”).  On May 17, 2016, Governor \nMcCrory and NCDPS moved to transfer their lawsuit (the 238 case) \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 3 of 8\n\nto this court.  The proposed intervenors and North Carolinians for \nPrivacy then moved to consolidate their cases (the 240 and 245 \ncases, respectively) with Governor McCrory and NCDPS’ case (the \n238 case).     \nOn May 16, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in the present case.  (Doc. 21.)  On May 25, 2016, the \nproposed intervenors filed the instant motion to intervene.  (Doc. \n33.)  At present, the federal court in the Eastern District has \nconditionally  granted  the  proposed  intervenors’  motion  to \nconsolidate the 238 and 240 cases, but it has not ruled on North \nCarolinians for Privacy’s motion to consolidate the 238 and 245 \ncases or Governor McCrory and NCDPS’ motion to transfer the 238 \ncase.  As a result, five separate lawsuits involving HB2 remain \npending: two before this court, and three before two different \njudges in the Eastern District.   \n \nII. ANALYSIS \nThe proposed intervenors seek to intervene as defendants in \nthis case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and \n(b).  (Doc. 33.)  Plaintiffs generally do not oppose the proposed \nintervenors’ motion, subject to a few caveats discussed below.  \n(See Doc. 41 at 1.)  Because the court concludes that the motion \nshould  be  granted  under  Rule  24(b)’s  permissive  intervention \nstandards, there is no need to address the proposed intervenors’ \narguments that they are entitled to intervention as a matter of \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 4 of 8\n\nright under Rule 24(a). \nUnder Rule 24(b) the court may permit anyone who “has a claim \nor defense that shares with the main action a common question of \nlaw or fact”  to  intervene on timely motion.  Fed.  R. Civ. P. \n24(b)(1)(B).    “In  exercising  its  discretion,  the  court  must \nconsider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice \nthe adjudication of the original parties’ rights.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 24(b)(3).  Thus, where a movant seeks permissive intervention \nas a defendant, the movant must satisfy three requirements: (1) \nthe motion is timely; (2) the defenses or counterclaims have a \nquestion of law or fact in common with the main action; and (3) \nintervention will not result in undue delay or prejudice to the \nexisting parties.  See Wright v. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc., 231 \nF.R.D. 475, 479 (M.D.N.C. 2005); Solo Cup Operating Corp. v. GGCY \nEnergy LLC, Civil No. WDQ-12-3194, 2013 WL 2151503, at *2 (D. Md. \nMay 15, 2013); Shanghai Meihao Elec., Inc. v. Leviton Mfg. Co., \n223 F.R.D. 386, 387 (D. Md. 2004).2  Trial courts are directed to \nconstrue  Rule  24  liberally  to  allow  intervention,  where \nappropriate.  Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d 722, 729 (4th Cir. 1986) \n(noting that “liberal intervention is desirable to dispose of as \n                     \n2 Intervention may also be denied when the intervening party would deprive \nthe court of subject matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Radchyshyn v. \nAllstate Indem. Co., 311 F.R.D. 156, 158–61 (W.D.N.C. 2015).  This is \nnot  an  issue  in  this  case  because  all  of  Plaintiffs’  and  proposed \nintervenors’ claims appear to rely on federal question jurisdiction.  \n(See Doc. 9 at 6–7; Doc. 36.) \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 5 of 8\n\nmuch  of  a  controversy  involving  as  many  apparently  concerned \npersons  as  is  compatible  with  efficiency  and  due  process”) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Capacchione v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 179 F.R.D. 505, 507 (W.D.N.C. \n1998) (same). \nHere, there is no dispute the motion is timely.  The proposed \nintervenors filed their motion on May 25, 2016, before any of the \noriginal Defendants made any filings in the case and just nine \ndays  after  Plaintiffs  filed  their  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction.  See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 282 F.R.D. 403, \n405 (E.D. Va. 2012) (holding that a motion to intervene is timely \nwhere a case has not progressed past the pleadings stage); cf. \nMacGregor  v.  Farmers  Ins.  Exch.,  No.  2:10–cv–03088,  2012  WL \n5380631, at *2 (D.S.C. Oct. 31, 2012) (motion to intervene untimely \nwhen filed more than five months after the passage of the court’s \ndeadline to join parties and amend the pleadings).  Similarly, \nthere is no dispute that the proposed intervenors’ defenses and \ncounterclaims share common questions of law and fact with the main \naction  in  this  case.    Indeed,  the  proposed  intervenors’ \ncontemplated  pleading  raises  factual  allegations  and  legal \narguments arising out of the same subject matter – passage of HB2 \nand its application – as Plaintiffs’ amended complaint.       \nFinally, the addition of the proposed intervenors will not \ncause undue delay or prejudice to the original parties in this \n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 6 of 8\n\ncase.    Because  the  proposed  intervenors’  defenses  and \ncounterclaims largely overlap with the legal and factual issues \nthat are already present in the main action, the addition of the \nproposed intervenors is not likely to significantly complicate the \nproceedings or unduly expand the scope of any discovery in this \ncase.  In addition, the proposed intervenors have already filed \ntheir proposed answer and counterclaims (Doc. 36), and the deadline \nfor responses to the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction \nhas not yet passed.  Thus, the addition of the proposed intervenors \nshould not significantly delay proceedings in this case.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs do not oppose the proposed intervenors’ \nmotion, they do express concern that the addition of the proposed \nintervenors will delay resolution of their motion for preliminary \ninjunction.  (Doc. 41 at 2–3.)  Yet, the proposed intervenors \ncurrently do not seek additional time to respond to the Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.    The  court  will  therefore  permit  the  legislators  to \nintervene, and the intervenors will be subject to the same schedule \nas the original Defendants.  Similarly, Plaintiffs contend that \nthe proposed intervenors should not be permitted to file an answer \nasserting  counterclaims  for  declaratory  relief  because,  they \nargue, the legislators lack standing to bring their own claims \nand, in any event, such claims are merely duplicative as a “mirror \nimage of Plaintiffs’ claims in this action.”  (Id. at 3–5.)  These \nissues have not been fully briefed, and the court declines to \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 44   Filed 06/06/16   Page 7 of 8\n\naddress them at this time.  The court will consider any appropriate \nsubsequent motions if and when they are presented.  \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the proposed intervenors’ motion \nto intervene (Doc. 33) is GRANTED. \n \n   /s/   Thomas D.

SCHROEDER, Chief District Judge. \nThis case originated as a challenge to North Carolina’s Public \nFacilities Privacy & Security Act, 2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 3, commonly \nknown as House Bill 2 (“HB2”), which required, among other things, \nthat  public  agencies  ensure  that  multiple  occupancy  restrooms, \nshowers, and other similar facilities be “designated for and only \nused by” persons based on the “biological sex” listed on their \nbirth certificate.  That law was repealed during the pendency of \nthis  action,  and  Plaintiffs  eventually  filed  a  Fourth  Amended \nComplaint (Doc. 210), claiming that the repealing law, 2017 N.C. \nSess. Laws 4, commonly known as House Bill 142 (“HB142”), violates \ntheir Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (“Title \nIX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e  et  seq.  (“Title  VII”)  (id.  ¶¶  1,  35).    In  short, \nPlaintiffs,  who  include  persons  who  identify  as  transgender, \nallege two principal forms of injury.  First, they contend that \nthey  are  injured  by  legal  uncertainty  as  to  which  restrooms, \nshowers,  and  changing  facilities  they  are  permitted  to  use.  \nSecond,  they  contend  that  they  are  injured  both  by  HB142’s \npreemption of attempts by any local government to “enact or amend \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 2 of 64\n\nan ordinance regulating private employment practices or regulating \npublic  accommodations,”  HB142  §  31  (“Section  3”);  and  also  by \nHB142’s prohibition of attempts by any state agency or political \nsubdivision  to  “regulat[e]  .  .  .  access  to  multiple  occupancy \nrestrooms, showers, or changing facilities, except in accordance \nwith an act of the General Assembly,” HB142 § 2 (“Section 2”). \nBefore the court are motions to dismiss by Senator Phil Berger \nand  Speaker  Tim  Moore  (“Intervenor-Defendants”),  proceeding  in \ntheir official capacities as heads of the General Assembly’s two \nchambers  (Doc.  221),  and  by  the  University  of  North  Carolina \n(“UNC”) and its President, Margaret Spellings (together, the “UNC \nDefendants”) (Doc. 222).2  The court held a hearing on the motions \non June 25, 2018. \nFor  the  reasons  set  forth  below,  the  court  finds  that \nPlaintiffs lack standing as to their substantive due process (Count \n1), Title IX (Count 6), and Title VII (Count 7) claims based on \nalleged legal uncertainty caused by HB142, but do have standing to \n                     \n1 This provision expires on December 1, 2020.  HB142 § 4. \n \n2 Separately, Plaintiffs have moved jointly with Governor Cooper and \nthose  Defendants  associated  with  his  administration  for  entry  of  a \nconsent  decree  that  would  declare  that  transgender  persons  are  not \nprevented from using public facilities in accordance with their gender \nidentity, and permanently enjoining those Defendants and their employees \nfrom prohibiting transgender persons from doing so.  (Doc. 216; Doc. \n216-1.)  Because Intervenor-Defendants and the UNC Defendants contend \nthat Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claims, the court has \ndetermined that it must first resolve the issue of its subject matter \njurisdiction before entertaining the proposed consent decree.  (Doc. 226 \nat 2.) \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 3 of 64\n\npursue their equal protection (Count 2) claims relating to the \npreemption provisions of Sections 2 and 3, except as to President \nSpellings.  Further, the court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \ncontingent claims involving HB2 (Counts 3, 4, and 5) at this time \nand reserves ruling on Plaintiffs’ nominal damages (Counts 6 and \n7) claims for alleged Title VII and IX violations during the time \nHB2 was in effect.  As to Count 2, the court finds that Plaintiffs \nfail to state a claim based on Section 2, but succeed in stating \na claim based on Section 3. \n  As a result, the UNC Defendants’ motion to dismiss will be \ngranted except as to Plaintiffs’ contingent claims involving HB2 \nin Counts 3, 4, and 5, and as to Plaintiffs’ claims for nominal \ndamages  in  Counts  6  and  7  for  the  alleged  Title  VII  and  IX \nviolations that occurred while HB2 was in effect.  Intervenor-\nDefendants’  motion  to  dismiss  will  be  granted  except  as  to \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claims based on Section 3 in Count 2, \nand as to Plaintiffs’ contingent claims involving HB2 in Counts 3, \n4, and 5. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe  facts  are  found  in  the  403  numbered  paragraphs  of \nPlaintiffs’ 103-page Fourth Amended Complaint, which is construed \nin the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as well as those matters \nof which the court can take judicial notice.  Considered together, \nthey demonstrate the following: \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 4 of 64\n\nA.  HB2 \nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council amended, by \na  vote  of  seven  to  four,  its  existing  non-discrimination \nordinances, making it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of \n“marital  status,  familial  status,  sexual  orientation,  gender \nidentity,  [and]  gender  expression.”3    (Doc.  127  at  12–13 \n(alteration in original); see also Doc. 210 ¶ 200.)  The amendment \nalso  repealed  prior  rules  that  exempted  “[r]estrooms,  shower \nrooms, bathhouses, and similar facilities which are in their nature \ndistinctly  private”  from  the  city’s  prohibitions  against  sex \ndiscrimination.  (Doc. 127 at 12 (alteration in original).) \nThe Charlotte ordinance prompted a quick reaction from then-\nGovernor  Patrick  McCrory  and  the  General  Assembly.    Governor \nMcCrory had informed the Charlotte City Council members before \npassage of the ordinance that the State would likely take immediate \naction upon the ordinance’s passage, since it would “‘chang[e] \nbasic  long-established  values  and  norms’  surrounding  ‘public \nrestrooms’” and present “possible danger from deviant actions by \nindividuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  (Doc. 210 \n¶ 205.)  On February 23, 2016, Speaker Moore announced that he and \nfellow  Republicans  would  seek  “a  legislative  intervention  to \n                     \n3  Charlotte’s  existing  non-discrimination  ordinances  prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, \nethnicity, age, disability, and sex.  (Doc. 127 at 12 n.5.) \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 5 of 64\n\ncorrect  [the  Charlotte  City  Council’s]  radical  course.”    (Id. \n¶ 206.)  On March 23, 2016, the General Assembly convened for a \nspecial session, during which members of the House Judiciary IV \nCommittee  —  the  committee  that  first  considered  HB2  —  were \nallegedly given only minutes to read HB2 before voting on whether \nto send the bill back to the House for a full debate.  (Id. ¶¶ 211–\n215.)  After three hours of debate, the House passed HB2.  (Id. \n¶ 216.)  The bill proceeded to pass unanimously in the Senate, \nfollowing a walk-out by all Democratic Senators.  (Id. ¶ 217.)  \nGovernor McCrory signed the bill into law later that day, and it \nbecame effective immediately.  (Id. ¶ 220.) \nHB2 affected North Carolina law in several ways.  First, it \nmodified  the  State’s  non-discrimination  laws.   Previously,  the \nState had prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \ncolor, national origin, age, sex, and handicap.  See HB2 § 3.1.  \nPart III of HB2 modified this language to prohibit discrimination \non  the  basis  of  “biological  sex,”  defined  as  “[t]he  physical \ncondition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s \nbirth certificate,” rather than simply “sex.”  HB2 §§ 1.2–1.3, 3.1 \n(modifying N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-422.2).  It also extended these \nnon-discrimination provisions, which had previously applied only \nto  the  State,  to  private  employers  and  places  of  public \naccommodation.  See id. §§ 3.1-3.3.  Part III also precluded state \ncommon-law  causes  of  action  for  violations  of  those  non-\n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 6 of 64\n\ndiscrimination provisions.  See id. § 3.2. \nSecond, Parts II and III of HB2 preempted all local ordinances \nthat  conflicted  with  the  new  non-discrimination  standards, \nincluding  the  Charlotte  ordinance  that  prompted  HB2’s  passage.  \nId. §§ 2.1–3.3.  Third, Part I of HB2 explicitly set new rules for \nthe use of restrooms and changing facilities operated by state \nagencies.  Specifically, Part I provided that all public agencies, \nincluding local boards of public education, must “require” that \n“every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility . . . be \ndesignated for and only used by persons based on their biological \nsex,” defined as the “physical condition of being male or female, \nwhich is stated on a person’s birth certificate.”  Id. §§ 1.2-1.3. \nBefore  HB2  was  passed,  Plaintiffs  maintained,  transgender \nindividuals used the bathrooms they believed aligned with their \ngender identity without apparent fear of prosecution under state \nlaw.  (See Doc. 103 at 20–21, (noting that “the status quo was \nworking  for  transgender  people  in  that  they  could  make  these \njudgments [about which bathrooms to use]”), and at 70 (Governor’s \ncounsel speculating same).)  Under Part I of HB2, North Carolina \nlaw explicitly regulated which bathrooms were available for use by \ntransgender individuals — the bathrooms that matched the gender \nlisted on their birth certificates.  HB2 § 1. \nPlaintiffs filed this action on March 28, 2016.  (Doc. 1.) \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 7 of 64\n\nB.  Preliminary Injunction \nOn May 16, 2016, Plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing Part I of HB2, the so-called “bathroom” \nprovisions.  (Doc. 21.)  After a hearing, the court issued an 83-\npage decision on August 26, 2016, granting the motion as to three \nindividual Plaintiffs employed by UNC.  (Doc. 127).  In doing so, \nthe  court  noted  that  for  “transgender  individuals  who  used \nfacilities  that  did  not  match  the  sex  listed  on  their  birth \ncertificate[s],” HB2 foreclosed any argument that they believed \nthey had permission to enter facilities that matched their gender \nidentity.  (Id. at 18.)  The court found that the three individual \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX \nclaim  because  the  Department  of  Education  (“DOE”)  had  issued \nguidance that “sex” under Title IX included gender identity such \nthat  covered  institutions  must  treat  transgender  individuals \nconsistent with their gender identity, which the Fourth Circuit \nheld in G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d \n709, 723 (4th Cir. 2016), vacated and remanded, 137 S. Ct. 1239 \n(2017) (mem.) required this court’s deference.  (Doc. 127 at 45.)  \nThe court also found that Plaintiffs had not shown that they were \nlikely to succeed on their equal protection claim and reserved \nruling on their due process claims.  (Doc. 127 at 59–60, 79–81.) \nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Amended Complaint on \nSeptember 21, 2016, (Doc. 151) and a Third Amended Complaint on \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 8 of 64\n\nNovember 21, 2016 (Doc. 183). \nIn 2017, the DOE withdrew its interpretative guidance, which \nled the Supreme Court to vacate the Fourth Circuit’s judgment in \nG.G. and remand the case for further consideration.  See Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G. ex. rel. Grimm, 137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017) \n(mem.).  The Fourth Circuit subsequently remanded the case to the \ndistrict court, which dismissed all claims for prospective relief \nas moot in light of the plaintiff’s graduation from high school, \nbut  continued  to  consider  claims  for  nominal  damages  and \nretrospective declaratory relief.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. \nBd., No. 4:15-CV-54, 2017 WL 9882602 (E.D. Va. Dec. 12, 2017). \nC.  HB142 \nAs part of an apparent compromise to secure the repeal of \nHB2, the Charlotte City Council repealed its non-discrimination \nordinance  on  December  21,  2016,4  shortly  before  the  General \nAssembly met in special session to consider the repeal of HB2.  \n(Doc. 210 ¶¶ 227–33.)  During this special session, a bill which \nwould have been a “clean repeal” of HB2 — repealing HB2 with no \nfurther conditions — was introduced but was referred to a committee \nand never considered.  (Id. ¶ 235.) \nOn March 30, 2017, HB142 was passed and signed by Governor \n                     \n4 A December 19, 2016 repeal was expressly conditioned on the General \nAssembly’s repeal of HB2, but due to criticisms that the City’s repeal \nwas not sufficient, it passed the subsequent repeal two days later.  \n(Doc. 210 ¶¶ 227-233.) \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 9 of 64\n\nRoy Cooper, who had been elected the prior November.  (Doc. 210 \n¶¶ 224,  244.)    In  order  to  pass  the  bill  quickly,  the  Senate \nemployed a process known as “gut and amend,”5 and neither the full \nHouse nor the full Senate heard public comment before voting on \nHB142.  (Id. ¶¶ 243–44.) \nHB142 is set out as follows.  Section 1 repeals HB2.  HB142 \n§ 1.  Section 2 amends Chapter 142 of the North Carolina General \nStatutes by adding a new article, Article 81A, § 143-760, which \nreads: \nState  agencies,  boards,  offices,  departments, \ninstitutions,  branches  of  government,  including  The \nUniversity  of  North  Carolina  and  the  North  Carolina \nCommunity College System, and political subdivisions of \nthe  State,  including  local  boards  of  education,  are \npreempted  from  regulation  of  access  to  multiple \noccupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, \nexcept in accordance with an act of the General Assembly. \nId. § 2.  Section 3 provides that “[n]o local government in this \nState may enact or amend an ordinance regulating private employment \npractices or regulating public accommodations.”  Id. § 3.  Section \n4 states that “[t]his act is effective when it becomes law” and \nthat “Section 3 of this act expires on December 1, 2020.”  Id. \n§ 4. \n \n                     \n5 Specifically, the North Carolina Senate took “an unrelated bill that \nhad already passed the House, removed the existing language and replaced \nit with the text of what is now H.B. 142.”  (Doc. 210 ¶ 243.)  This \npermitted the bill to meet a state requirement that every bill pass a \ncrossover deadline from one chamber to the other. \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 10 of 64\n\nD.  Fourth Amended Complaint, Proposed Consent Decree, and \nMotion for Leave to File Declaration of Ericka Myers \n \nOn August 29, 2017, in response to the passage of HB142, \nPlaintiffs moved, with consent, for leave to file a Fourth Amended \nComplaint.  (Doc. 208.)  The motion was granted (Doc. 209), and \nPlaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint on September 7, \n2017.  (Doc. 210.)  The Fourth Amended Complaint asserts that HB142 \n“is  the  culmination  of  a  series  of  actions  by  North  Carolina \nlawmakers targeting LGBT individuals, and particularly transgender \nindividuals, for discrimination” and alleges that HB142 “violates \nfundamental guarantees of equal protection and due process in the \nU.S.  Constitution  and  statutory  prohibitions  on  discrimination \nbased on sex under Title IX and Title VII.”  (Id. ¶ 2.) \nSpecifically, Count 1 brings a substantive due process claim \nagainst Governor Cooper, Attorney General Joshua Stein, Department \nof Administration Secretary Michelle Sanders, Department of Health \nand  Human  Services  Secretary  Mandy  K.  Cohen,  Department  of \nTransportation  Secretary  James  H.  Trogdon  (each  sued  in  their \nofficial capacity; hereinafter the “Executive Branch Defendants”) \nand  Spellings,  claiming  that  (1)  HB142  is  void  for  vagueness \nbecause it does not inform transgender individuals whether they \nwill  be  subject  to  prosecution  for  using  the  restrooms  or \nfacilities that align with their gender identity and (2) that these \nDefendants have taken no action to clarify whether transgender \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 11 of 64\n\nindividuals will be subject to prosecution for using the restrooms \nor facilities that align with their gender identity.  (Id. ¶¶ 297–\n312.)    Count  2  brings  an  equal  protection  claim  against  the \nExecutive  Branch  Defendants  and  Spellings,  claiming  that  the \npreemption of state agencies regulating access to restrooms or \nother  single-sex,  multiple  user  facilities,  as  well  as  the \npreemption of new or amended local non-discrimination protections, \nconstitute  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  because  these \npreemptions deprive transgender individuals of the ability to seek \ngreater protections at the local level on the same basis as other \ngroups, are being applied in a discriminatory manner, and were \npassed with discriminatory intent.  (Id. ¶¶ 313–44.)  Counts 3, 4, \nand 5 challenge HB2, alleging violations of equal protection, the \nright to privacy, and liberty and autonomy in the right to refuse \nunwanted medical treatment.  (Id. ¶¶ 345–90.)  Count 6 brings a \nTitle IX claim against UNC, claiming that UNC is a recipient of \nfederal funds and that it is discriminating on the basis of sex by \nfailing to ensure that transgender individuals may use restrooms \nand  changing  facilities  consistent  with  their  gender  identity \nwithout fear of prosecution.  (Id. ¶¶ 391–98.)  Count 7 brings a \nTitle VII claim against UNC on behalf of Plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño \n— a transgender man — claiming that UNC employs him and that it is \ndiscriminating against him on the basis of sex, as described in \nCount 6.  (Id. ¶¶ 399–403.) \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 12 of 64\n\nOn  October  18,  2017,  Plaintiffs  and  Executive  Branch \nDefendants filed a joint motion for the entry of a consent decree.  \n(Doc. 216.)  The proposed consent decree states that “[u]nder H.B. \n142, and with respect to public facilities that are subject to \nExecutive Branch Defendants’ control or supervision, transgender \npeople are not prevented from the use of public facilities in \naccordance with their gender identity” and that “Executive Branch \nDefendants  as  used  in  this  paragraph  shall  include  their \nsuccessors, officers, and employees.”  (Id. at 5.)  Further, the \nproposed  consent  decree  states the  Executive  Branch  Defendants \n“are hereby permanently enjoined from enforcing Section 2 of H.B. \n142  to  bar,  prohibit,  block,  deter,  or  impede  any  transgender \nindividuals  from  using  public  facilities  under  any  Executive \nBranch Defendant’s control or supervision, in accordance with the \ntransgender individual’s gender identity” and that an individual \nwho uses a public facility under the control of the Executive \nBranch cannot be prosecuted for the otherwise lawful use of the \nfacility  that  conforms  with  the  individual’s  gender  identity.  \n(Id.)  Lastly, the proposed consent decree states that the parties \nshall “bear their own fees, expenses, and costs with respect to \nall  claims  raised  by  Plaintiffs  against  the  Executive  Branch \nDefendants” and stipulates to the dismissal of the remaining claims \nagainst the Executive Branch Defendants.  (Id. at 5–6.) \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 13 of 64\n\nOn  October  23,  2017,  Intervenor-Defendants6  and  the  UNC \nDefendants filed separate motions to dismiss.  (Docs. 221, 222.)  \nThese motions predominantly argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to \nbring  their  claims  and  that,  even  if  they  do  have  standing, \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  state  their  claims  sufficiently  to \nsurvive the motions to dismiss.  Both motions have been fully \nbriefed and are ready for decision.7  (Docs. 223, 225, 233, 234, \n235.)    Lastly,  Plaintiffs  have  moved  for  leave  to  file  the \ndeclaration of Ericka Myers (Doc. 236), a mother of a transgender \nstudent; this motion has also been fully briefed and is ready for \ndecision (Docs. 237, 240, 241, 242).8 \nII.  ANALYSIS \nThe court will first address the motion for leave to file the \ndeclaration of Ericka Myers, as Plaintiffs claim that the court \nshould consider that declaration in connection with the motions to \ndismiss.  The court will then turn to the motions to dismiss. \nA.  Motion for Leave to File Declaration of Ericka Myers \nIn  her  declaration,  Myers  states  that  her  eight  year-old \ndaughter is transgender, in that “she was assigned the sex male at \n                     \n6 The court granted Intervenor-Defendants’ motion to intervene (Doc. 33) \non June 6, 2016.  (Doc. 44.) \n \n7 The Executive Branch Defendants take no position with respect to the \nmotions to dismiss. \n \n8 Consistent with its prior orders (Docs. 226, 228) and the requests of \ncounsel at the June 25, 2018 motions hearing, this order will not address \nthe joint motion for entry of the consent decree. \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 14 of 64\n\nbirth,” but “she has known from a young age that she is a girl.”  \n(Doc.  237–1  ¶  4.)    Myers  explains  that  her  daughter  has  been \ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria9 and that her treatment includes \nliving all aspects of her life as a female.  (Id. ¶¶ 5–6.)  However, \nher daughter’s elementary school, in the New Hanover County School \nDistrict in North Carolina, bars her daughter from using the girls’ \nrestroom because she is transgender.  (Id. ¶¶ 3, 7.)  According to \nMyers, the school’s principal has explained that this is because \nshe believes that HB142 makes it illegal for a transgender student \nto use a restroom that does not match her birth-assigned sex — or \nat least that HB142 “permits schools” to deny such use.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  \nWhile Myers’ daughter has been told that she can “use the nurse’s \nrestroom or the restroom in the teacher’s lounge,” she has declined \nto “use either of these restrooms because she feels humiliated and \nsingled out as different when she is the only student forced to \nuse them.”  (Id. ¶ 10.)  As a result, and because boys in the boy’s \nrestroom have told her to “get out because she is in the wrong \nplace,” her daughter has “struggled to be recognized as her true \nself,” “often holds her urine throughout the school day, and uses \n                     \n9  Gender  dysphoria  occurs  when  a  transgender  individual  experiences \nemotional, psychological, or social distress because “their deeply felt, \ncore identification and self-image as a particular gender does not align” \nwith their birth sex.  (See Doc. 22-1 ¶ 19.)  For purposes of the present \nmotion, the court accepts Plaintiffs’ earlier unrebutted evidence that \nsome transgender individuals form their gender identity misalignment at \na young age and exhibit distinct “brain structure, connectivity, and \nfunction that do not match their birth-assigned sex.”  (Id. ¶¶ 18, 21–\n22.) \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 15 of 64\n\nthe restroom as soon as she gets home.”  (Id. ¶¶ 13–14.) \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  court  can  consider  the  Myers \ndeclaration in resolving the pending motions to dismiss because \n“[w]hen standing is raised as a basis to dismiss, the court ‘may \nconsider  evidence  outside  the  pleadings  without  converting  the \nproceeding to one for summary judgment.’”  (Doc. 237 at 4 (quoting \nWhite Tail Park, Inc. v. Stroube, 413 F.3d 451, 459 (4th Cir. \n2005)).)  Plaintiffs note that this court has considered affidavits \nfiled by a plaintiff to demonstrate standing in the past.  Nat’l \nAll.  for  Accessibility,  Inc.  v.  Rite  Aid  of  N.C.,  Inc.,  No. \n1:10CV932, 2011 WL 4499294, at *5 n.5 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 27, 2011) \n(“Fourth Circuit authority . . . appears to permit the use of such \naffidavits . . . .”).  Plaintiffs argue that the Myers declaration \nprovides additional evidence that HB142 causes injury.  (Doc. 237 \nat 5–6.)  They also point out that no Defendant actually opposes \nthe request for leave to file the declaration, but instead argue \nonly that the court should not consider the declaration when ruling \non the motions to dismiss and that the declaration does not support \nPlaintiffs’ standing claims.  (Doc. 242 at 1.) \nThe  UNC  Defendants  “do  not  oppose  the  filing  of  the \ndeclaration,  but  do  oppose  Plaintiffs’  request  that  the  Court \nconsider [the] declaration when ruling” on their motion to dismiss.  \n(Doc. 240 at 1.)  They argue that extrinsic evidence, such as that \npresented in the Myers declaration, is not relevant to their motion \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 16 of 64\n\nto dismiss, as  “[t]he question before the  Court is . . . the \nadequacy of the allegations in the Complaint.”  (Id. at 3.)  This \nis  because  the  UNC  Defendants  claim  to  have  brought  a  facial \nchallenge to standing only, and “[a] court may ‘look beyond the \ncomplaint’ only ‘[i]n a factual challenge.’”  (Id. at 2 (quoting \nWikimedia Found. v. NSA, 857 F.3d 193, 208 (4th Cir. 2017)).)  They \nfurther argue that the Myers declaration is “immaterial because it \nrecounts events that occurred after the filing of the complaint” \nand otherwise has no connection to the UNC Defendants.  (Id. at 3–\n4.) \nIntervenor-Defendants argue that the Myers declaration would \nnot  help  the  court  in  determining  standing  because  the  harm \ndescribed in the declaration is caused by the officials in the New \nHanover School District, rather than by any Defendant in this case.  \n(Doc. 241 at 3.)  They also  contend  that “the mere fact that \ncertain school officials not before the Court may have mistakenly \nidentified HB 142 as a basis for their restroom  policy cannot \nestablish that HB 142 legally caused the alleged harms, nor that \na favorable decision in this case would redress those harms.”  (Id. \nat 4.) \nThe Fourth Circuit recently explained the distinction between \nfacial and factual challenges to standing as follows: \nIn a facial challenge, the defendant contends that the \ncomplaint fails to allege facts upon which standing can \nbe  based,  and  the  plaintiff  is  afforded  the  same \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 17 of 64\n\nprocedural  protection  that  exists  on  a  motion  to \ndismiss.  In a factual challenge, the defendant contends \nthat the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint are \nnot true.  In that event, a trial court may look beyond \nthe complaint and in an evidentiary hearing determine if \nthere  are  facts  to  support  the  jurisdictional \nallegations. \nWikimedia, 857 F.3d at 208 (citations, internal quotation marks, \nand alterations omitted).  In a facial challenge, accordingly, \nwhere the plaintiff receives the presumption that all facts alleged \nin the complaint are true, the sole question before the court is \nwhether “the complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject \nmatter jurisdiction.”  Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 \n(4th Cir. 2009) (emphasis added).  It is only in an evidentiary \nhearing  for  a  factual  challenge,  where  “the  presumption  of \ntruthfulness normally accorded a complaint’s allegations does not \napply,” that “the trial court [has] the discretion to go beyond \nthe allegations of the complaint . . . [to] determine if there are \nfacts  to  support  the  jurisdictional  allegations.”    Beck  v. \nMcDonald, 848 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2017) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n  Neither  Intervenor-Defendants  nor  the  UNC  Defendants  base \ntheir arguments for dismissal for lack of standing on the falsity \nof any jurisdictional facts alleged by Plaintiffs.  Instead, they \nargue  that  the  complaint  on  its  face  simply  lacks  allegations \nestablishing standing.  As a result, the present motions to dismiss \nfor lack of standing are facial challenges to standing, and the \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 18 of 64\n\ncourt will not consider the Myers declaration in resolving them.10  \nSee N.C. Fisheries Ass’n, Inc. v. Pritzker, No. 4:14-CV-138-D, \n2015 WL 4488509, at *3 (E.D.N.C. July 22, 2015) (“[B]ecause this \nis a facial challenge, the court will consider only the amended \ncomplaint and its attached materials, and any documents attached \nto the motion to dismiss that are integral to the complaint and \nauthentic.”). \nB.  Motion to Dismiss HB142 Claims for Lack of Standing \n“It  is  well  established  that  standing  is  a  threshold \njurisdictional  issue  that  must  be  determined  first  because \n‘[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any \ncause.’”  Covenant Media of N.C., L.L.C. v. City of Monroe, 285 F. \nApp’x 30, 34 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter  Env’t,  523  U.S.  83,  94  (1998)).    The  basic  standing \nrequirements are that a plaintiff must show that: (1) he or she \nhas suffered an “injury in fact,” (2) the injury is “fairly . . . \ntrace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant,” and (3) it \nis “likely” that “the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted) \n(alteration and omission in original). \n                     \n10 Even if the court were to consider it, the Myers declaration does not \nprovide any appreciable support for Plaintiff’s position on standing, \ngiven that it is based on hearsay and indicates only a third party’s \ninterpretation of HB142, rather than evidence as to the actual meaning \nof HB142. \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 19 of 64\n\nThe injury in fact “requirement ensures that plaintiffs have \na ‘personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.’”  Kenny v. \nWilson, 885 F.3d 280, 287 (4th Cir. 2018) (citing Warth v. Seldin, \n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)).  An injury in fact is “‘an invasion of \na  legally  protected  interest’  that  is  ‘concrete  and \nparticularized’  and  ‘actual  or  imminent,  not  conjectural  or \nhypothetical.’”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 \n(2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  “An allegation of future \ninjury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, \nor there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.”  Susan \nB. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (citation \nand  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    When  plaintiffs  seek \nprospective relief, they must establish an ongoing or imminent \ninjury in fact.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974). \n  At bottom, Plaintiffs allege that they have been injured in \ntwo distinct ways: (1) HB142 leaves them uncertain as to which \nrestrooms or related facilities they are permitted to use, and (2) \nHB142 creates a barrier which prevents them from being able to \npetition their local governments for protective ordinances, and \nwhich causes them to be regulated unequally by state entities such \nas UNC.  The court will address standing as to each claimed injury \nin turn. \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 20 of 64\n\n1.  Injury by Uncertainty \nPlaintiffs’ first alleged injury is that they are unable to \nuse public restrooms and accommodations because they are uncertain \nabout which restrooms they are permitted to use and that this \nuncertainty creates a reasonable fear of prosecution for second-\ndegree trespass.11  (See Doc. 210 ¶¶ 302–12.)  Since HB142 has no \nenforcement mechanism — and indeed does not prohibit any possible \ncourse of conduct on the part of Plaintiffs — Plaintiffs rely on \na theory of injury wherein HB142’s preemption of regulation of \nrestroom access “except in accordance with an act of the General \nAssembly,” along with the fact that there is no applicable act of \nthe General Assembly affirmatively permitting access, “creat[es] \na permanent state of legal uncertainty” (id. ¶ 312) that makes it \nimpossible for transgender individuals to determine whether they \nwill be prosecuted under other statutes, such as North Carolina’s \nsecond-degree trespass law (id. ¶¶ 302–12); see also N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 14-159.13.12 \nIntervenor-Defendants argue principally that (1) uncertainty \nabout the law alone does not create an actionable injury; (2) \n                     \n11 Although Plaintiffs hint vaguely at fear of prosecution under other \nstate laws (see, e.g., Doc. 210 ¶ 307 (alleging fear of “criminal or \nother penalty”)), the only state law they specify as relevant to their \ndue process claim is the second-degree trespass statute (id. ¶ 306). \n \n12 In addition, under Section 3, local governments are precluded from \npassing any new or amended ordinances regulating public accommodations \nor private employment regardless of whether or not such ordinances would \nbe “in accordance with an act of the General Assembly.”  HB142 § 3. \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 21 of 64\n\nPlaintiffs’ choice not to use government restrooms is a “self-\ninflicted injury” that cannot give rise to standing, as Plaintiffs \nhave no credible fear of prosecution; and (3) HB142 is not vague \n— it repeals HB2, preempts state agencies from regulating access \nto multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, \nand  preempts  local  governments  from  enacting  or  amending \nordinances regulating public accommodations and private employment \npractices.  (Doc. 234 at 2–7.) \nThe UNC Defendants similarly argue that (1) Plaintiffs do not \nactually face uncertainty as a result of HB142; (2) even if they \ndid, uncertainty about the meaning of a law is not an injury in \nfact; and (3) anxiety about the application of state trespass laws \ndoes not establish standing to bring claims against HB142.13  (Doc. \n223 at 8–12.) \nIn certain circumstances, a plaintiff’s allegations of fear \nof future prosecution may satisfy the injury-in-fact requirements \nfor prospective relief: \n[T]here is a sufficiently imminent injury in fact if \nplaintiffs allege an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct  arguably  affected  with  a  constitutional \ninterest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists \na credible threat of prosecution thereunder.  [I]t is \nnot necessary that [a plaintiff] first expose himself to \nactual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge \n                     \n13 The UNC Defendants also argue that the court’s justiciability analysis \nin an earlier order dealing with HB2 (Doc. 127) militates against the \nconclusion that Plaintiffs have standing to bring claims against the UNC \nDefendants here (Doc. 223 at 13–14). \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 22 of 64\n\na  statute  that  he  claims  deters  the  exercise  of  his \nconstitutional rights. \nKenny, 885 F.3d at 288 (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted) (second and third alterations in original).14  Whether the \ninjury is alleged to be sufficiently imminent or an ongoing injury \nin  fact,  Plaintiffs  must  show  that  their  fear  of  criminal \nprosecution is “not imaginary or wholly speculative” in order for \nthat fear to give rise to standing.  Babbitt v. United Farm Workers \nNat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 302 (1979).  In all cases of this type, \nthen,  the  threat  of  prosecution  must  be  both  “credible”  and \n“immediate.”  EQT Prod. Co. v. Wender, 191 F. Supp. 3d 583, 591 \n(S.D. W. Va. 2016), aff’d, 870 F.3d 322 (4th Cir. 2017) (citations \nomitted); see also id. (noting that a plaintiff must “show more \nthan the fact that state officials stand ready to perform their \ngeneral duty to enforce laws” (quoting Doe v. Duling, 782 F.2d \n1202, 1206 (4th Cir. 1986))).  For the standing analysis, as with \nthe  other  bases  for  Defendants’  motions  to  dismiss,  the  court \n“accept[s] all properly pled factual allegations in the complaint \n                     \n14  In  the  same  case,  the  Fourth  Circuit  noted  a  second  method  of \nestablishing injury in fact: a “sufficient showing of self-censorship, \nwhich occurs when a claimant is chilled from exercising his right to \nfree expression.”  Kenny, 885 F.3d at 288 (quoting Cooksey v. Futrell, \n721 F.3d 226, 235 (4th Cir. 2013)).  As its wording makes clear, this \nlatter standard for an ongoing (as opposed to imminent) injury in fact \nis confined to First Amendment cases, where the “standing requirements \nare somewhat relaxed.”  Cooksey, 721 F.3d at 235.  The standard for \nongoing injury in fact in non-First Amendment cases based on a fear of \nfuture government action is explained in Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, \n568 U.S. 398 (2013), and is discussed and applied below. \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 23 of 64\n\nas true and construe[s] all facts in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff.”  Doe v. Va. Dep’t of State Police, 713 F.3d 745, \n752 (4th Cir. 2013). \n  Here,  Plaintiffs  fail  to  demonstrate  that  their  claims \nagainst HB142 based on legal uncertainty meet any of the three \nbases for standing. \nAs to the alleged injury in fact, the court first notes that \nHB142 says nothing about Plaintiffs’ ability to use any facility \nof any kind, nor does it regulate Plaintiffs in any other way.  \nThis accords with the statement of Governor Cooper, quoted in the \nFourth  Amended  Complaint,  that  there  is  currently  “no  North \nCarolina state law barring the use of multiple occupancy bathroom \nfacilities in accordance with gender identity.”  (Doc. 210 ¶ 15.)  \nPlaintiffs respond by alleging a credible fear of prosecution under \nother state statutes — namely, the second-degree trespass statute.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-159.13.  This argument could certainly \nhave been made during the time that HB2 was in force, since HB2 \ngave  legal  import  to  the  gender-specific  placards  on  bathroom \ndoors.  (See Doc. 127 at 25–27 (“Although UNC has not changed the \nwords and symbols on its sex-segregated facilities, the meaning of \nthose words and symbols has changed as a result of [HB2].”  Id. at \n26.).)  Under HB2, multiple occupancy bathrooms were required to \nbe designated for use only by persons of the same “biological sex,” \nwhere that term was defined as “[t]he physical condition of being \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 24 of 64\n\nmale or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate,” \nHB2 §§ 1.2–1.3.  But HB2 has been repealed.  Its replacement, \nHB142, requires nothing of the kind. \nIndeed, HB142 returns Plaintiffs to the status quo ante — the \nvery position that, until now, they have consistently asserted to \nbe their preferred remedy in this case.  (Doc. 103 at 6–8, 20 \n(stating at preliminary injunction hearing that “[t]here was no \nrecord prior to the passage of [HB2] of problems being caused in \nNorth  Carolina . . . by  transgender  people  using  restrooms  and \nchanging facilities consistent with their gender identity,” that \n“the status quo was fine,” and that “[t]he status quo was working \nfor transgender people in that they . . . could use common sense” \nabout which restrooms to use).)  Plaintiffs’ repeated assertions \nalong these lines also accord with their inability to cite a single \ncase in North Carolina of a transgender individual being prosecuted \nfor using the restroom that corresponded to his or her gender \nidentity,  despite  the  fact  that  at  least  “some  transgender \nindividuals have been quietly using bathrooms and other facilities \nthat match their gender identity” for years.  (Doc. 127 at 3.)  \nGiven that HB142 repealed HB2 and its biological-access language, \nthe status quo that the Plaintiffs requested — at least insofar as \nit relates to state and local interpretation of legal access to \ngender-specific restrooms — has been restored.  The relief sought \nby Plaintiffs earlier in this litigation cannot now transform into \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 25 of 64\n\nan injury in fact that gives rise to standing. \nIn response, Plaintiffs argue that as a result of the series \nof events giving rise to (and including) this litigation, there is \na heightened political animosity towards transgender individuals \nregarding their access to bathrooms, such that the likelihood of \nthe State’s trespass laws being used against them has increased.  \nAlong  these  lines,  Plaintiffs  point  to  statements  of  certain \nlegislators  and  politicians  who  have  claimed  that  the  State’s \ntrespass  laws  prohibit  transgender  access  to  restrooms  not \nmatching one’s biological sex.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 74, 246.) \nWhat  this  argument  attempts  to  do,  however,  is  graft \nPlaintiffs’ fears about the State’s enforcement of its trespass \nlaws onto HB142.  As an initial matter, it is far from clear that \nsuch a threat is sufficiently imminent.  As noted above, Governor \nCooper has represented the opposite conclusion (id. ¶ 15.), and \nhe, the Attorney General, and the rest of the Executive Branch \nDefendants are urging the entry of a consent decree in this action \nthat would expressly and permanently preclude their prosecution of \na transgender individual for “us[ing] public facilities . . . when \nsuch use conforms with the individual’s gender identity, and is \notherwise lawful.”  (Doc. 216-1 at 5 (also requesting that it be \nordered and adjudged that “[u]nder H.B. 142, and with respect to \npublic facilities that are subject to Executive Branch Defendants’ \ncontrol or supervision, transgender people are not prevented from \n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 26 of 64\n\nthe  use  of  public  facilities  in  accordance  with  their  gender \nidentity”).)  In addition, and independent of any consent decree \nrequest,  the  Governor  has  already  issued  an  Executive  Order \nproviding — among other protections — that “State agencies, boards, \ncommissions, and departments under the jurisdiction of the Office \nof the Governor will not adopt policies or regulations barring, \nprohibiting, blocking, deterring, or impeding any individual who \nlawfully  uses  public  facilities  under  their  control  or \nsupervision,  in  accordance  with  that  individual’s  gender \nidentity.”15    N.C.  Exec.  Order  No.  24  (Oct.  18,  2017) \n(https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO24-\nPolicies%20Prohibiting%20DiscriminationHarassment%26Retaliation%\n20in%20State%20EmploymentServicesContracts.pdf). \nTo the extent Plaintiffs attempt to characterize their injury \nnot as imminent (the future prosecution itself) but as ongoing \n(see, e.g., Doc. 210 ¶ 282 (describing Plaintiffs’ current delay \nand avoidance of restroom use — in fear of future prosecution — \nand noting the potentially “severe health consequences” of such \n                     \n15 The Executive Order also states that it “is subject to and does not \notherwise conflict with or abrogate existing state law.”  The court takes \njudicial notice of the Executive Order pursuant to Rule 201(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Evidence.  See Clatterbuck v. City of Charlottesville, \n708 F.3d 549, 557 (4th Cir. 2013) (noting that, on a motion to dismiss, \n“courts may consider ‘relevant facts obtained from the public record,’ \nso long as these facts are construed in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff  along  with  the  well-pleaded  allegations  of  the  complaint” \n(quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 283 (1986))), abrogated on \nother grounds by Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015). \n \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 27 of 64\n\nmeasures)), this characterization necessarily “fares no better.”  \nClapper  v.  Amnesty  Int’l  USA,  568  U.S.  398,  415  (2013).    The \nSupreme Court has been clear that plaintiffs cannot bootstrap their \nway to an injury in fact by harming themselves in the present when \nthe future prosecution they allegedly fear is not sufficiently \nimminent.    See  id.  at  416  (“[Plaintiffs]  cannot  manufacture \nstanding merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their \nfears  of  hypothetical  future  harm  that  is  not  certainly \nimpending.”). \nMoreover, even if the court were to assume that Plaintiffs \nallege  a  sufficient  injury  in  fact,16  Plaintiffs  fail  to \n                     \n16 It is important to note that Plaintiffs expressly “do not challenge” \nthe  use  of  gender-specific  signs  outside  of  restrooms  and  other \nfacilities.  (Doc. 210 at 102 n.1.)  Nevertheless, they argue that such \nsigns are sufficient under North Carolina law to provide “notice not to \nenter  the  premises,”  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  14-159.13,  to  transgender \nindividuals  attempting  to  use  the  restroom  corresponding  with  their \ngender identity, thus exposing transgender individuals to prosecution \nfor trespass.  (Doc. 233 at 30–32.)  In support of this proposition they \ncite In re S.M.S., 675 S.E.2d 44 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009).  In that case, a \nhigh  school  boy  “r[a]n  through”  a  girls’  locker  room,  causing \nconsiderable havoc and leading to his subsequent prosecution for second-\ndegree trespass.  Id. at 44–45.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals \nheld that a “sign marked ‘Girl’s Locker Room,’” in conjunction with the \ndefendant’s “admission that he violated school rules by entering the \ngirls’ locker room” “was reasonably likely to give respondent notice \nthat he was not authorized to go into the girls’ locker room, pursuant \nto [the second-degree trespass statute].”  Id. at 46.  The court need \nnot speculate on how a North Carolina court would address this issue in \nthe context of individuals using bathrooms in accordance with their \ngender identity, were such an issue to ever arise.  Suffice it to say \nthat the defendant in S.M.S. made no argument that he was attempting to \nuse a facility aligned with his gender identity (in fact, it does not \nappear that he intended to “use” the facility in any ordinary or relevant \nsense), and he admitted knowledge that his entry into the girls’ locker \nroom was against school rules.  Moreover, at the hearing on the present \nmotions, the UNC Defendants expressly disclaimed the ability to regulate, \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 28 of 64\n\nsufficiently allege that such an injury is fairly traceable to any \nact by any Defendant.  To meet the traceability requirement, an \ninjury must be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action \nof the defendant,” as opposed to “result[ing] from the independent \naction of some third party not before the court.”  Simon v. E. Ky. \nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 (1976).  “The traceability \nrequirement ensures that it is likely the plaintiff’s injury was \ncaused by the challenged conduct of the defendant.”  Friends for \nFerrell Parkway, LLC v. Stasko, 282 F.3d 315, 320 (4th Cir. 2002) \n(emphasis added). \nHB142  does  not  regulate  restroom  access  in  any  fashion; \nindeed, it prohibits such regulation “except in accordance with an \nact of the General Assembly.”  (Doc. 210 at ¶ 312.)  If Plaintiffs \nfear  that  some  other  law  will  be  enforced  against  them \nunconstitutionally, their remedy is to challenge that law — either \nfacially or as applied to them. \nIn addition, as to their constitutional claims, Plaintiffs \nfail  to  show  that  any  alleged  uncertainty  injury  —  i.e.,  the \npotential enforcement of some other law against them — could be \nredressed by a favorable decision of this court.  As it pertains \nto those claims, the Fourth Amended Complaint simply pleads for \n                     \nby institutional rule or policy, whether transgender individuals may use \nrestrooms that align with their gender identity, as a result of HB142’s \nprohibition on such regulations. \n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 29 of 64\n\nthis  court  to  strike  down  HB142  and/or  find  it  unenforceable \nagainst Plaintiffs.  Even if the court granted this relief in full, \nit would not redress Plaintiffs’ stated fears about the application \nof state trespass laws against them. \n  For  all  these  reasons,  therefore,  the  court  finds  that \nPlaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege an injury in fact fairly \ntraceable to an act of any Defendant that is capable of being \nredressed by a favorable decision of this court in this case.  \nPlaintiffs’  constitutional  claims  based  on  a  theory  of  legal \nuncertainty must therefore be dismissed. \nPlaintiffs’ Title IX (Count 6) and Title VII (Count 7) claims \nagainst UNC are similarly based on the theory that Plaintiffs are \nharmed by UNC’s failure to take action to ensure that Plaintiffs \nmay use restrooms and changing facilities consistent with their \ngender identity.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 395–98, 403.)  Having found that \nthis alleged uncertainty does not create an injury in fact, the \ncourt finds that UNC has not harmed Plaintiffs by refusing to take \nthe affirmative step of informing Plaintiffs that they will not be \nsubject to prosecution for using the restroom that aligns with \ntheir  gender  identity.    This  conclusion  is  bolstered  by \nrepresentations by UNC Defendants’ counsel at the motion hearing \nthat they consider themselves preempted by HB142 from regulating \nindividuals’  access  to  restrooms  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ Title IX and Title VII claims \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 30 of 64\n\nwill also be dismissed for lack of standing. \n2.  Injury by Preemption of Non-Discrimination Policies \nand Ordinances \n \nPlaintiffs’ second claim of injury is that they are harmed by \nHB142’s Section 2, which preempts regulation concerning access to \nrestrooms and other facilities by state agencies, departments, and \nother political subdivisions of the State of North Carolina, as \nwell  as  by  Section  3’s  preemption  of  new  or  amended  local \ngovernment ordinances regulating access to public accommodations \nand private employment practices.  (Id. ¶¶ 313–44.)  Plaintiffs \nargue  that  these  barriers  prevent  transgender  individuals  from \nbeing able to access the legislative process and petition their \nlocal governments, as well as school boards, universities, and \nother branches of government, for non-discrimination protections.  \n(Doc. 233 at 20–21.)  They argue that these barriers are themselves \ninjuries in fact. (Id. at 20 (“Encountering the barrier is the \ninjury that confers standing.”).) \nIntervenor-Defendants argue that Plaintiffs still have the \nright to advocate for their preferred policies at the state level \nunder HB142, even if they will not be able to affect policy change \nat the local level, and that HB142 does not create an unequal \nbarrier for Plaintiffs because anyone trying to enact a policy \nregulating private employment practices or public accommodations, \nor attempting to persuade a state agency to regulate access to \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 31 of 64\n\nrestrooms, will face the same barriers Plaintiffs face.  (Doc. 234 \nat 5–6.) \nThe UNC Defendants argue that HB142 — and thus the barriers \nabout which Plaintiffs complain — is not traceable to them because \nthe “University and President Spellings neither drafted, proposed, \nvoted on, passed, enacted, signed, nor ratified HB 142.  Nor do \nthey have the legal power to ‘clarify’ it.”  (Doc. 223 at 10.)17 \nGenerally, if a plaintiff can demonstrate that he or she has \nthe intention to take a particular lawful action that “has been \nthwarted  by  official  action”  that  was  discriminatory,  that \nplaintiff  has  demonstrated  an  injury  in  fact.    See  Vill.  of \nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 \n(1977) (finding that a plaintiff had standing to bring a claim \nwhen the “injury [he] assert[ed] [wa]s that his quest for housing \nnearer his employment ha[d] been thwarted by official action that \n[wa]s racially discriminatory”).  Further, the denial of equal \ntreatment resulting from the imposition of a barrier that makes it \nmore difficult for a certain class of people to receive a benefit \nthan for those outside that class may create an injury in fact.  \nNe. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).  It is not necessary for \n                     \n17 Although the UNC Defendants argue generally on behalf of both the \nUniversity and President Spellings, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims \n(Count 2) are only brought against President Spellings. \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 32 of 64\n\na plaintiff to show that he or she would have received a certain \nbenefit in order for that plaintiff to show an injury in fact by \nway of a government barrier to seeking — or to seeking on “equal \nfooting”  with  members  of  other  groups  —  the  receipt  of  that \nbenefit.  Id. (“When the government erects a barrier that makes it \nmore difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than \nit is for members of another group, a member of the former group \nseeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would \nhave obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish \nstanding.”). \nViewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Fourth \nAmended Complaint alleges an injury in fact on Plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claim.  First, Plaintiffs claim that, if not for HB142’s \nprohibition  on  local  anti-discrimination  ordinances  and \nregulations,  they  “would  advocate  for  local  ordinances  that \nprohibit discrimination in employment and public accommodations \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity.”  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 83, \n121, 156, 170, 192.)  Second — although they need not show this in \norder to adequately demonstrate standing — Plaintiffs have claimed \nthat  at  least  some  of  the  localities  where  they  reside \n(specifically,  Carrboro,  Chapel Hill,  and  Orange  County)  would \npass ordinances that “prohibit discrimination in employment and \npublic accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity” if they were permitted to do so.  (Id. ¶¶ 81, 170, 190.)  \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 33 of 64\n\nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that HB142 discriminates against them \non the basis of their transgender status.  (Id. at 278.)  Just as \na plaintiff in Arlington Heights demonstrated an injury in fact by \nasserting that his attempt to find housing closer to his employment \nwas thwarted by discriminatory official action, Plaintiffs here \nassert that HB142 has thwarted their attempts to lobby for, and \nreceive  the  benefits  of,  protective  ordinances  or  regulations.  \nSee 429 U.S. at 264.  While HB142 does not prohibit Plaintiffs’ \nefforts  at  advocacy,  it  plainly  makes  them  meaningless  by \nprohibiting even the prospect of relief at the local level.  Thus, \nHB142’s preemption of local regulation of public accommodations \nand private employment practices, as well as agency regulation of \naccess to bathrooms and other facilities, creates an injury in \nfact as to Plaintiffs.  Northeastern, 508 U.S. at 666 (“The ‘injury \nin fact’ in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial \nof equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier.”). \nIntervenor-Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs  have  no \n“legally  protected  interest”  in  lobbying  for  local  protective \nordinances or regulations (Doc. 225 at 6), and they cite the Fourth \nCircuit’s decision in Friends for Ferrell Parkway, LLC v. Stasko, \n282 F.3d 315 (4th Cir. 2002) in support of the proposition that \n“the destruction of [plaintiffs’] opportunities to lobby for” a \nbenefit is not an injury in fact.  Id. at 324.  But Stasko was not \nan equal protection case.  In Stasko, a proposed acquisition of \n34 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 34 of 64\n\nland by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — in alleged violation \nof certain environmental and other statutes — would have precluded \nthe potential construction of a parkway on that land.  Id. at 318–\n19.    The  plaintiffs  there  argued  that  the  deprivation  of  the \nopportunity to lobby for such a parkway, which would bring them \neconomic benefits if constructed, was an injury in fact.   The \nFourth Circuit rejected this alleged injury because the likelihood \nof the parkway being built was too “remote.”  Id. at 325.  As the \ncourt noted: “[P]laintiffs cannot sidestep the requirements for \nstanding  by  recharacterizing  a  wholly  speculative  injury  as  a \ndiminished opportunity to prevent that injury when the facts reveal \nthe ‘opportunity’ itself to be just as tenuous.”  Id. at 324. \nIn the instant case, however — as with equal protection cases \nof this type — Plaintiffs are not merely “recharacterizing” one \ninjury (here, the lack of anti-discrimination ordinances) as a \ndiminished opportunity to prevent that injury through lobbying.  \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  made  clear  that  “the  imposition  of  the \nbarrier” is itself the injury in “equal protection case[s] of this \nvariety,” not the plaintiff’s “ultimate inability to obtain the \nbenefit.”  Northeastern, 508 U.S. at 666; see Regents of Univ. of \nCal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 280 n.14 (1978) (finding sufficient \ninjury in fact “in the University’s decision not to permit [the \nplaintiff] to compete for all 100 places in the class” and noting \nthat “even if [the plaintiff] had been unable to prove that he \n35 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 35 of 64\n\nwould have been admitted in the absence of the [barrier], it would \nnot follow that he lacked standing”).18 \nIntervenor-Defendants finally contend that HB142 cannot cause \nPlaintiffs a “particularized” injury, Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548, \nsince HB142 “also forecloses proponents of [HB2’s] now-repealed \nbiological-access policy from seeking to enact it at the agency or \nlocal level.”   (Doc. 225 at 5 n.4).   But this argument  again \nignores those equal protection cases based on facially neutral \nlaws.  It is definitionally the case that a facially neutral law \nwill, “on its face,” treat all citizens “in an identical manner.”  \nHunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391 (1969).  But in the instant \ncase, Plaintiffs allege that “the reality is that the law’s impact \nfalls on the minority.”  Id.  It is transgender individuals, not \nbiological-access  advocates,  who  allege  denial  of  the  equal \nprotection of the laws.  See id. (“The majority needs no protection \nagainst discrimination.”).  To the extent that biological-access \nadvocates  may  have  other  complaints  about  HB142’s  preemption \n                     \n18 Even if the court were to look through the imposition of the barrier \nto Plaintiffs’ likelihood of gaining the benefit itself, Intervenor-\nDefendants’ argument fails.  Unlike in Stasko, where the plaintiffs’ \nhoped-for achievement of their desired benefit was “pure conjecture” and \nwas based on “numerous, questionable assumptions” that were in opposition \nto  “[s]ubstantial  evidence  in  the  record,”  282  F.3d  at  323,  here \nPlaintiffs point out that Charlotte had previously adopted just the sort \nof anti-discrimination ordinance Plaintiffs desire; in fact, it was that \nordinance that sparked both HB2 and this litigation.  Plaintiffs allege \nin effect that, if not for HB142 (and certainly HB2 before it), the \nCharlotte ordinance may still be in effect.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 226–28, 233, \n330.) \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 36 of 64\n\nprovisions,  those  complaints  do  not  preclude  transgender \nindividuals from asserting a particularized injury.  See id. at \n390–91 (“It is true that [the challenged law] draws no distinctions \namong racial and religious groups.  Negroes and whites, Jews and \nCatholics are all subject to the same requirements if there is \nhousing discrimination against them which they wish to end.  But \n[the challenged law] nevertheless disadvantages those who would \nbenefit  from  laws  barring  racial,  religious,  or  ancestral \ndiscriminations . . . .”). \nPlaintiffs have also adequately alleged traceability as to \nthe  Executive  Branch  Defendants,  although  not  as  to  President \nSpellings.  As to the Executive Branch Defendants, traceability is \neasily  met  given  that  (1)  HB142  is  the  sole  cause  of  the \nprohibition on new or amended local non-discrimination ordinances \nand agency regulation of restroom access; (2) HB142 was negotiated \nfor and signed by Governor Cooper; and (3) the Executive Branch \nDefendants are tasked with enforcing and upholding the law.  (Doc. \n210 ¶¶ 226, 229, 244.)  See Mich. Bldg. & Const. Trades Council, \nAFL-CIO v. Snyder, 846 F. Supp. 2d 766, 777–78 (E.D. Mich. 2012) \n(“The Court finds that the alleged injuries are fairly traceable \nto the Defendant.  As Governor of Michigan, Defendant signed the \nAct  into  law  and  is  responsible  for  its  enforcement.  .  .  . \nPlaintiffs’ alleged injuries are directly traceable to the Act . \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 37 of 64\n\n. . .”).19 \nHowever,  traceability  fails  with  respect  to  President \nSpellings because she had and has nothing to do with the drafting, \npassage, or enforcement of HB142.20  The injury relevant to this \nequal protection claim is Plaintiffs’ effective preclusion under \nHB142 from advocating for certain anti-discrimination protections \nfrom entities like UNC, not the actual denial of such protections \non the part of UNC.  President Spellings has done nothing to deny \nPlaintiffs  the  opportunity  to  advocate  for  anti-discrimination \nprotections  relating  to  transgender  bathroom  access.    Instead, \nPresident  Spellings  has  only  declined  to  give  Plaintiffs  the \naffirmative permission they request; as discussed above, this is \n                     \n19 Further, no party has directly argued that Plaintiffs’ equal protection \nclaims are not traceable to the Executive Branch Defendants on the ground \ntheir connection to the passage of HB142 is too attenuated.  The mere \nsignature of a governor on a bill and his general duty to enforce state \nlaws is not always sufficient for the law’s impact to be traceable to \nthe Executive Branch.  See Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Alabama, No. \n2:15-CV-02193-LSC, 2017 WL 782776, at *5–7 (N.D. Ala. Mar. 1, 2017) \n(finding that a challenged statute was not traceable to the governor who \nsigned the bill into law but was not “sufficiently responsible for [its] \nadministration”); NAACP v. California, 511 F. Supp. 1244, 1261–62 (E.D. \nCal.  1981),  aff’d,  711  F.2d  121  (9th  Cir.  1983)  (finding  that  a \nchallenged constitutional amendment was not traceable to the governor \nwho signed the legislation proposing the amendment because the effect \nof his signature was only to put the amendment on a ballot where voters \nwould decide whether the amendment should go into effect).  In the \ninstant case, however, Governor Cooper signed HB142 directly into law, \nappears  to  have  been  involved  in  the  negotiations  that  led  to  its \npassage, and is presumably authorized to enforce it.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 226, \n229, 244).  Thus, HB142’s prohibitions are sufficiently traceable to him \nand the other Executive Branch Defendants. \n \n20 As previously stated, HB142 does not regulate individuals, nor does \nit empower or require other parties to regulate individuals.  As a \nresult, President Spellings cannot enforce HB142 against Plaintiffs. \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 38 of 64\n\nnot an injury in fact.  As a result, since it cannot fairly be \nsaid that Plaintiffs’ injuries relating to preemption of advocacy \nfor  anti-discrimination  protections  were  “caused  by”  President \nSpellings’ conduct, Stasko, 282 F.3d at 320, the equal protection \nclaim brought in Count 2 against President Spellings should be \ndismissed. \n  Finally,  the  court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  adequately \nshown  redressability.    While  a  merely  “speculative”  claim  of \nredressability  is  insufficient, Plaintiffs  need only  show  that \nthat their alleged injury is “likely . . . [to] be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citation and internal \nquotation  marks  omitted)  (emphasis  added).    “[N]o  explicit \nguarantee of redress to a plaintiff is required to demonstrate a \nplaintiff’s  standing.”    Equity  in  Athletics,  Inc.  v.  Dep’t  of \nEduc., 639 F.3d 91, 100 (4th Cir. 2011).  Here, in so far as \nPlaintiffs’ alleged injury is the barrier to anti-discrimination \nadvocacy created by HB142, and because the court has the power to \nenjoin  the  enforcement  of  HB142,  Plaintiffs  have  adequately \ndemonstrated that a favorable decision of this court is likely to \nprovide them with the relief they seek. \nAs a result, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have standing \nto bring their Count 2 equal protection claim against the Executive \nBranch Defendants. \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 39 of 64\n\nC.  Motion to Dismiss HB2 Claims for Lack of Ripeness \nCounts 3, 4, and 5 of the Fourth Amended Complaint challenge \nHB2.  Plaintiffs contend that they have “adequately pled plausible \nclaims that HB142 is invalid, leaving open the possibility that \nthe HB2 claims will require resolution” in the event that HB142 § \n1 is struck down and HB2 goes back into effect.  (Doc. 233 at 45–\n46.) \nIntervenor-Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims against \nHB2  are  not  ripe  because  those  claims  “depend  on  the  Court \nanswering a whole host of preliminary questions.”  (Doc. 234 at \n11.)  In order for Plaintiffs’ claims against HB2 to be ripe, they \nargue, the court would first need to decide that “(1) one or more \nprovisions of HB 142 are unlawful and (2) the provision of HB 142 \nrepealing HB 2 is not severable from HB 142’s unlawful provisions.”  \n(Doc. 225 at 22.)  Plaintiffs argue that while the court need not \nconsider their claims challenging HB2 in Counts 3, 4, and 5 at \nthis time, they remain ripe. \nRipeness is a threshold issue and bids the court consider \nwhether “[a] claim . . . rests upon contingent future events that \nmay not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”  \nTexas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  “Where an injury is contingent \nupon a decision to be made by a third party that has not yet acted, \nit is not ripe as the subject of decision in a federal court.”  \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 40 of 64\n\nDoe v. Virginia Dep’t of State Police, 713 F.3d 745, 758 (4th Cir. \n2013)  (citation  omitted).    To  determine  ripeness,  the  court \n“balance[s] the fitness of the issues for judicial decision with \nthe hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.”  \nId. (citation omitted). \n  While any challenge to HB2 is currently premature, Defendants \nhave  not  demonstrated  that  such  claims  should  be  dismissed  on \nripeness grounds.  Contingencies dependent on the future actions \nof third parties are generally too attenuated to be ripe, but the \ncourt itself is not a third party.  Should Plaintiffs succeed on \ntheir remaining claims against HB142, there is a possibility — \nhowever remote — that the court will be required in this action to \naddress Plaintiffs’ alternative claims against HB2.  Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss on ripeness grounds will therefore be denied at \nthis time.21  See Dimensional Music Publ’g, LLC v. Kersey ex rel. \nEstate of Kersey, 448 F. Supp. 2d 643, 653 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (“Simply \nbecause the outcome of one claim is contingent upon the outcome of \n                     \n21 Intervenor-Defendants (Doc. 225 at 10–11) and the UNC Defendants (Doc. \n223  at  14–16)  also  argue  that  Plaintiffs’  HB142  claims  should  be \ndismissed on ripeness grounds.  Intervenor-Defendants’ arguments appear \nto be directed at Plaintiffs’ claims based on legal uncertainty, not \ntheir  claims  based  on  preemption  of  non-discrimination  policies  and \nordinances.  (Doc. 225 at 10–11 (“Plaintiffs cannot solve this [ripeness] \nissue by relying on their alleged uncertainty about the applicable law.”  \nId. at 11.).)  Because the court has already found that Plaintiffs lack \nstanding  to  pursue  their  legal  uncertainty  claims,  Intervenor-\nDefendants’  ripeness  arguments  as  to  HB142  need  not  be  reached.  \nSimilarly, because all of Plaintiffs’ claims against the UNC Defendants \nbased on HB142 are dismissed pursuant to this order, the UNC Defendants’ \nripeness arguments as to HB142 also need not be reached. \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 41 of 64\n\nanother claim in the case does not mean that the first claim cannot \nbe  alleged  or  that  the  first  claim  is  not  ripe.”  (citations \nomitted)). \nD.

Equal Protection Claims \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 2 has a disparate impact on \ntransgender individuals because, while it prohibits regulation of \nrestroom access by state agencies and various other entities, the \nUNC Defendants continue to regulate access to restrooms by labeling \nrestrooms as for “men” and “women.”22  They argue that Section 2 \ncreates “one rule for transgender individuals and another for non-\ntransgender individuals” because the UNC Defendants are willing to \nregulate access to restrooms in one sense, but refuse to regulate \naccess to restrooms in the sense of clarifying which restrooms \ntransgender individuals are permitted to use.  (Doc. 233 at 40, \n43.)  Plaintiffs argue that Section 3 has a disparate impact on \ntransgender individuals because it prevents the passage of local \nordinances  that  would  protect  transgender  individuals  from \ndiscrimination.    (Doc.  233  at  40–43.)    They  argue  that  this \npreemption has a disparate impact because pre-existing ordinances \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, \n                     \n22 Plaintiffs also claim that UNC Defendants are regulating access to \nrestrooms by providing maintenance to the restrooms, and “regulating \nwhen and how a restroom is cleaned, or whether those with disabilities \nwould have access” to restrooms.  (Doc. 233 at 40.)  As noted previously, \nPlaintiffs  expressly  do  not  challenge  any  Defendant’s  practice  of \nmaintaining separate men’s and women’s restrooms.  (Doc. 210 at 102 \nn.1.). \n43 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 43 of 64\n\nnational origin, sex, or any other ground continue to be valid.  \n(Id. at 40.)  As such, Plaintiffs claim, they have a need to seek \nprotective ordinances that most others do not and that they are \ndisproportionately harmed by HB142’s barrier to their ability to \naccess the political process for greater protection.  (Id. at 43–\n44.)    Plaintiffs  then  argue  that  HB142  was  passed  with \ndiscriminatory  intent  because:  (1)  it  follows,  and  cannot  be \nconsidered without reference to, HB2, which was passed in response \nto  Charlotte’s  adoption  of  an  anti-discrimination  ordinance \nprotecting transgender individuals; (2) statements from certain \nNorth Carolina legislators demonstrate that HB142 was not intended \nto repeal HB2’s prohibition on transgender individuals’ restroom \nuse  in  accordance  with  their  gender  identity;  (3)  HB142  was \nintroduced, debated, passed, and signed within a single day, which \ndeparts  from  the  normal  procedural  sequence  and  “signals \ndiscriminatory intent;” and (4) it has a disproportionate impact \non transgender individuals.  (Id. at 41–42.) \n  Intervenor-Defendants argue that Section 3 does not create a \ndisproportionate impact on transgender individuals because (1) it \nonly  “centralizes  authority  to  set  certain  access  and  non-\ndiscrimination policies;” (2) it is a facially neutral law that \ndoes not disproportionately burden transgender individuals, but \nbenefits transgender individuals by repealing HB2; and (3) it does \nnot  impose  a  more  burdensome  political  process  on  transgender \n44 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 44 of 64\n\nindividuals because it “equally forecloses local advocacy for the \nbiological-access policies previously embodied in HB 2.”  (Doc. \n225  at  13–17.)    They  argue  that  Section  2  has  no  enforcement \nmechanism,  so  Plaintiffs’  concern  that  it  is  being  enforced \ndisparately is misplaced, and that state agencies have not been \n“regulating” restroom access in violation of HB142 by providing \nseparate male and female facilities.  (Doc. 234 at 7.)  Intervenor-\nDefendants also argue that HB142 was not passed with discriminatory \nintent, but that it was the result of “a bipartisan political \ncompromise  bringing  advantages  and  disadvantages  for  everyone” \nthat the court should not “second-guess.”  (Id. at 3 n.1, 8.) \nA  facially  neutral  law  that  has  an  adverse  effect  on  a \nminority group violates the equal protection clause only if it can \nbe shown that the law was passed with a discriminatory purpose.  \nSee Crawford v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Los Angeles, 458 U.S. 527, \n535–38 (1982); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239–48 (1976); \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265 (“Proof of . . . discriminatory \nintent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal \nProtection  Clause.”).    Plaintiffs  “need  not  show  that \ndiscriminatory purpose was the ‘sole[]’ or even a ‘primary’ motive \nfor the legislation, just that it was ‘a motivating factor.’”  N.C. \nState Conf. of NAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d 204, 220 (4th Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265–66).  “When considering \nwhether discriminatory intent motivates a facially neutral law, a \n45 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 45 of 64\n\ncourt must undertake a ‘sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial \nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.’”  Id. (quoting \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).  Discriminatory intent “may \noften  be  inferred  from  the  totality  of  the  relevant  facts, \nincluding the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily \non one [group] than another.”  Davis, 426 U.S. at 242.  But although \nthe fact that a facially neutral law has disparate impact on a \ncertain  group  is  relevant  to  the  equal  protection  analysis, \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266 (disparate impact “may provide \nan  important  starting  point”),  disparate  impact  alone  is  not \nsufficient to show discriminatory purpose: \n[W]e have not held that a law, neutral on its face and \nserving ends otherwise within the power of government to \npursue,  is  invalid  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause \nsimply because it may affect a greater proportion of one \nrace than of another.  Disproportionate impact is not \nirrelevant,  but  it  is  not  the  sole  touchstone  of  an \ninvidious  racial  discrimination  forbidden  by  the \nConstitution. \nDavis, 426 U.S. at 242.  “[T]he ultimate question remains: did the \nlegislature enact a law ‘because of,’ and not ‘in spite of,’ its \ndiscriminatory effect.”  McCrory, 831 F.3d at 220 (quoting Pers. \nAdm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)). \nIf  Plaintiffs  succeed  at  making  this  showing  of \ndiscriminatory intent, “the court proceeds to determine whether \nthe disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite \nlevel of scrutiny.”  Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th \n46 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 46 of 64\n\nCir.  2001).    “The  level  of  scrutiny  depends  on  the  type  of \nclassification.”  Sansotta v. Town of Nags Head, 724 F.3d 533, 542 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nIn conducting the discriminatory intent analysis, the court \nuses as a guide the (nonexhaustive) factors set forth in Arlington \nHeights: (1) “the [disparate] impact of the official action,” (2) \n“[t]he historical background of the [challenged] decision,” (3) \n“[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged \ndecision,” (4) “[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence,” \nand (5) “the legislative or administrative history.”  429 U.S. at \n266–68. \n  The first conclusion the court reaches in the discriminatory \nintent analysis is that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly plead \nthat the preemption of regulation of access to multiple occupancy \nrestrooms, showers, or changing facilities in Section 2 impacts \nthem disproportionately.  Plaintiffs’ argument as to Section 2 \ncenters  on  the  theory  that  providing  “separate  ‘men’s’  and \n‘women’s’ restrooms” by “maintaining or posting [gender-specific] \nsigns” constitutes regulation of bathroom access, and therefore \nthat  transgender  individuals  are  being  treated  unequally  when \nentities like UNC disclaim the ability to regulate bathroom access \nas to transgender individuals.  (Doc. 233 at 8 n.1, 38, 43.)  But \nwhile Plaintiffs are correct that Section 2 prevents state entities \nlike  UNC  from  regulating  access  to  restrooms,  the  court  is \n47 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 47 of 64\n\nunpersuaded that the mere provision of separate male and female \nfacilities is regulation of restroom access, in the relevant sense.  \nAs the UNC Defendants point out, a regulation is an authoritative \nrule with the force of law, and “[o]ne would not normally describe \na  [gender-specific]  sign  outside  a  bathroom”  as  meeting  this \ndescription.  (Doc. 235.)  Although gender-specific bathroom signs \nmight properly have been considered to have the force of law under \nHB2, which specifically gave legal import to such signs (see Doc. \n127 at 26 (“[T]he meaning of those words and symbols [outside \nbathrooms] has changed as a result of [HB2].”)), HB2 has been \nrepealed in full.  Its replacement, HB142, imbues gender-specific \nbathroom signs with no such legal import.  And Plaintiffs do not \npoint to any institutional rule or policy on the part of UNC or \nany other state entity that purports to assign legal import to \ngender-specific  bathroom  signs.    Plaintiffs’  argument  also \ncontradicts Plaintiffs’ admission that they do not challenge the \nhistorical convention of using “men’s” and “women’s” labels for \nsuch facilities.  As a result, despite Plaintiffs’ claims to the \ncontrary, it does not appear that state entities like UNC are \n“regulating” access to restrooms at all, much less regulating that \naccess in a way that impacts Plaintiffs disparately. \nFurther, as outlined earlier in this opinion, see supra Part \nII.B.1.,  it  is  not  a  harm  to  Plaintiffs  that  they  lack  an \naffirmative statement from the UNC Defendants that Plaintiffs are \n48 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 48 of 64\n\npermitted to use the restrooms and facilities that align with their \ngender identity.  Nothing in the language of Section 2 can be \nconstrued  to  prevent  transgender  individuals  from  using  the \nrestrooms that align with their gender identity, as Plaintiffs \nclaim some had apparently been doing successfully prior to the \npassage of HB2.  (See Doc. 127 at 3, 11 (noting that the record \nshowed that, prior to the passage of HB2, “transgender individuals \nha[d]  been  quietly  using  facilities  corresponding  with  their \ngender identity”); Doc. 103 at 70 (Governor’s counsel stating, “my \nguess is that some transgender individuals will continue to use \nbathrooms  that  they  always  used  and  nobody  will  know”).)    In \naddition, the UNC Defendants stated at the motion hearing that \nthey are preempted from forbidding transgender individuals from \nusing the restrooms that are consistent with their gender identity.  \nBecause  Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  that  Section  2  disparately \nimpacts  them,  their  equal  protection  claim  against  Section  2 \nfails.23  See Morrison, 239 F.3d at 654 (“To succeed on an equal \nprotection claim, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he has \nbeen treated differently from others with whom he is similarly \nsituated.”). \n                     \n23 Because Plaintiffs fail to even show a disparate impact, which is the \n“important starting point” of their equal protection claim, Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 266, there is no need for the court to move on to \nthe other Arlington Heights factors.  See Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert \nCounty, 48 F.3d 810, 825 (4th Cir. 1995) (“[A]n equal protection claim \nmust  be  rooted  in  an  allegation  of  unequal  treatment  for  similarly \nsituated individuals.”). \n49 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 49 of 64\n\nHowever, the court does find that Plaintiffs have plausibly \npleaded that the preemption of new or amended local “ordinance[s] \nregulating  private  employment  practices  or  regulating  public \naccommodations”  in  Section  3  impacts  them  disproportionately.  \nJust like Section 2, Section 3 is facially neutral.  Further, as \nIntervenor-Defendants  point  out,  it  appears  that  the  State \nnormally  has  the  authority  to  centralize  its  decision-making \npowers by withholding the power to make certain decisions from \nlocal governments.  See Town of Boone v. State, 369 N.C. 126, 131 \n(2016) (“Local political subdivisions are mere instrumentalities \nof  the  state  for  the  more  convenient  administration  of  local \ngovernment, whose territory and functions rest in the absolute \ndiscretion of the state.” (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted)); see also id. (“[T]he General Assembly has long enjoyed \nplenary  power  to  create  political  subdivisions  of  local \ngovernment, establish their jurisdictional boundaries, and invest \nthem with certain powers”).  But it is an “unremarkable principle \nthat  the  State  may  not  alter  the  procedures  of  government  to \ntarget”  vulnerable  minority  groups,  even  when  that  alteration \nmight otherwise have an equally unremarkable legal basis.  Schuette \nv. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. 291, 304 (2014) \n(plurality opinion); see Hunter, 393 U.S. at 392 (noting that, \nwhile “insisting that a State may distribute legislative power as \nit desires . . . may generally be true,” it is equally true that \n50 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 50 of 64\n\nsuch a “principle[] furnish[es] no justification for a legislative \nstructure  which  otherwise  would  violate  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment”). \nHere, while HB142 presents the same barrier to anyone else \nseeking  a  protective  ordinance  as  it  does  to  transgender \nindividuals, Plaintiffs observe that transgender individuals have \na greater need for protective ordinances than other groups.  This \nis because protective statutes and ordinances that preexist HB142 \n— such as Charlotte’s ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex — continue \nto be valid.  Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege they lack the \nprotections  that  individuals  in  other  vulnerable  groups  enjoy.  \nFurther,  although  Intervenor-Defendants  protest  that  HB142 \n“equally  forecloses  local  advocacy  for  the  biological-access \npolicies previously embodied in [HB2]” (Doc. 225 at 16–17), it is \ntransgender individuals who have depended on success at the local \nlevel  (e.g.,  the  Charlotte  ordinance)  and  biological-access \nproponents who have depended on success at the state level (e.g., \nHB2).  As a result, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the \nforeclosure of new or amended local non-discrimination ordinances \nrelating to public accommodations impacts them disparately.  See \ngenerally Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391 (“[A]lthough the law on its face \ntreats Negro and white, Jew and gentile in an identical manner, \nthe reality is that the law’s impact falls on the minority.  The \n51 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 51 of 64\n\nmajority needs no protection against discrimination and if it did, \na referendum might be bothersome but no more than that.”).  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the inability to lobby \nfor,  and  receive,  greater  protections  at  the  local  level \ndisparately impacts them.  Cf. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631–\n36  (1996)  (finding  an  equal  protection  violation  where  state \namendment  specifically  eliminated  protective  ordinances  for \nhomosexuals  and  prevented  the  passage  of  state  or  local  laws \nprotective of such persons in the future). \nThe  court  also  finds  that  —  at  this  preliminary  stage  — \nPlaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Section 3 was passed with \ndiscriminatory intent sufficient to permit their equal protection \nclaim against that section to proceed.  The first Arlington Heights \nfactor, which is the disparate impact of the government action, \nhas already been shown above.  See 429 U.S. at 266.  While disparate \nimpact is not itself determinative of discriminatory intent, it is \nevidence of such intent.  Davis, 426 U.S. at 242. \nThe  second  Arlington  Heights  factor  is  the  “historical \nbackground” of the challenged law, 429 U.S. at 267, which here \ninvolves the passage of HB2.  Plaintiffs allege that HB2 was passed \nin  response  to  the  Charlotte  ordinance  that  granted  anti-\ndiscrimination protections to transgender individuals (Doc. 127 at \n13) which is some evidence that it — and now HB142, which similarly \nprecludes Charlotte-style ordinances — was motivated, at least in \n52 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 52 of 64\n\npart, by discriminatory intent.  In addition, they allege that the \nGeneral Assembly was presented with a “clean repeal” of HB2, but \nchose instead to enact a law that preempted anti-discrimination \nprovisions.  (Doc. 210 ¶ 235.) \nThe third Arlington Heights factor is “[d]epartures from the \nnormal procedural sequence.”  429 U.S. at 267.  Here, Plaintiffs \nallege that HB142 was introduced, debated, passed, signed, and \nwent into effect within a single day.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 208–20.)  To \naccomplish this, the legislature used a process known as “gut and \namend,”  where  an  existing  bill  that  had  passed  one  house  was \nstripped out and used as the vehicle for passing HB142.  (Id. \n¶¶ 243–45.)    While  Intervenor-Defendants  argue,  not \nunpersuasively, that this unusual procedural move was merely the \nresult of a “bipartisan political compromise” (Doc. 234 at 8) in \nresponse to the immense time-pressure imposed on the State to pass \na legislative repeal of HB2,24 this argument depends on a factual \ndetermination the court cannot make at this pleading stage, when \nthe facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.  \n                     \n24  Public backlash in response to the passage of HB2 was substantial and \nincluded the following: the National Basketball Association announced \nit would withdraw the February 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte; \nvarious cities and states in the United States barred publicly-funded \ntravel to North Carolina; and an estimated $3.76 billion in economic \nactivity  was  lost.    (Doc.  210  ¶ 223.)    In  addition,  the  National \nCollegiate Athletic Association announced that “North Carolina would be \nineligible to host any championships until 2022” unless HB2 was repealed \nby March 30, 2017.  (Id. ¶ 241.)  HB142 was passed and went into effect \non March 29, 2017.  (Id. ¶ 242.) \n53 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 53 of 64\n\nEl-Amin v. McDonnell, No. 3:12-CV-00538-JAG, 2013 WL 1193357, at \n*4 (E.D. Va. Mar. 22, 2013) (“In short, [plaintiff] has alleged \nboth discriminatory intent and disparate impact, and . . . has \npleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause.  This conclusion has nothing to do with \nthe claim’s ultimate likelihood of success, on which the Court \nexpresses no view.  It instead has to do with the basic reality \nthat the Court may not weigh evidence at the motion to dismiss \nstage, which is, in effect, what the defendants seek.”); Williams \nv. Hansen, 326 F.3d 569, 587 (4th Cir. 2003) (King, J., dissenting) \n(“Having  made  the  requisite  specific,  nonconclusory  factual \nallegations  in  support  of  their  equal  protection  claim,  the \nquestion of motive becomes one for the jury.”). \nThe fourth and final Arlington Heights factor is the relevant \nlegislative history.  429 U.S. at 268.  Although Plaintiffs catalog \na variety of statements made by North Carolina legislators “in the \npress and through their social media” in regard to the purpose and \neffect of HB142 (Doc. 210 ¶ 246), and proceed to argue that such \nstatements tend to “demonstrate[] discriminatory intent” (Doc. 233 \nat 42), such statements are not “legislative history.”  See Sylvia \nDev. Corp. v. Calvert County, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 819 (4th Cir. 1995) \n(describing  the fourth  Arlington  Heights  factor  as  referencing \n“contemporary statements by decisionmakers on the record or in \nminutes  of  their  meetings”  (emphasis  added)).    As  a  result, \n54 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 54 of 64\n\nPlaintiffs  have  not  alleged  any  relevant  legislative  history.  \nNevertheless, this lack of legislative history may well be the \nresult of the expedited legislative process for HB142, which — as \ndiscussed above — is itself relevant to the discriminatory intent \nanalysis.  (See  Doc. 210 ¶ 244 (“The bill was the subject of \nlimited  debate  as  it  progressed  rapidly  through  the  General \nAssembly . . . .”).)  In any case, Plaintiffs are not required to \nshow all four Arlington Heights factors in order to survive a \nmotion to dismiss.  McCrory, 831 F.3d at 204 (noting that Arlington \nHeights  merely  provides  “a  nonexhaustive  list  of  factors  to \nconsider  in  making  [the  discriminatory  intent]  inquiry”);  see \nSynovus Bank v. Coleman, 887 F. Supp. 2d 659, 668 (W.D.N.C. 2012) \n(“[S]urviving  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  remains  a  relatively  low \nbar.”) \nGiven that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged three of the \nfour Arlington Heights factors, that the fourth factor may be of \nlimited use when an expedited legislative process allows for little \ndebate, and that Plaintiffs need only show that discriminatory \nintent  was  one  of  many  motivating  factors  for  the  passage  of \nSection 3, the court finds Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that \nSection 3 was passed with discriminatory intent.  See generally \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265–66 (“Rarely can it be said that \na  legislature  or  administrative  body  operating  under  a  broad \nmandate made a decision motivated solely by a single concern, or \n55 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 55 of 64\n\neven that a particular purpose was the ‘dominant’ or ‘primary’ \none.  In fact, it is because legislators and administrators are \nproperly  concerned  with  balancing  numerous  competing \nconsiderations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of \ntheir  decisions,  absent  a  showing  of  arbitrariness  or \nirrationality.  But [unconstitutional] discrimination is not just \nanother competing consideration.  When there is a proof that a \n{ \"pageset\": \"Sc1\ndiscriminatory purpose  has been a motivating factor in \nthe decision, this judicial deference is no longer justified.”) \nHaving  determined  that  Plaintiffs  have  plausibly  alleged \ndiscriminatory intent, “the court proceeds to determine whether \nthe disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite \nlevel of scrutiny.”  Morrison, 239 F.3d at 654.  There has been \nconsiderable debate at the district and circuit court levels about \nthe applicable standard of scrutiny for classifications based on \ntransgender status, with the majority of courts to have considered \nthe  question  in  recent  years  finding  that  “heightened”  or \n“intermediate” scrutiny applies.25  See, e.g., Glenn v. Brumby, 663 \n                     \n25  “Intermediate  scrutiny  requires  the  state  to  show  that  its \njustification  for  the  classification  is  ‘exceedingly  persuasive.’”  \nM.A.B. v.

Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)).  \n“That is, the state is required to demonstrate that the classification \nserves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those \nobjectives.  Hypothesized or post hoc justifications created in response \nto litigation are insufficient to meet this burden, as are justifications \nbased on overbroad generalizations about sex.”  Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. \n56 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 56 of 64\n\nF.3d 1312, 1315–20 (11th Cir. 2011); M.A.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of \nTalbot County, 286 F.

Pa. 2015) (applying \nrational basis review).  The Fourth Circuit has not yet reached \nthe issue.  Plaintiffs argue that “strict or at least heightened \nscrutiny” should apply (Doc. 233 at 44 n.23), and no Defendant has \noffered an argument in its present briefing regarding the proper \nstandard of scrutiny.  Because the court finds at this stage that \nPlaintiffs  have sufficiently  pleaded  that  HB142  fails  rational \nbasis review, there is no need to resolve now whether a higher \nstandard of scrutiny should apply.26 \nRational basis review bids the court determine first “whether \nthe  end  that  the  state  seeks  to  achieve  is  a  legitimate \ngovernmental  purpose.”    Sylvia,  48  F.3d  at  820.    In  this \n                     \nSch. Bd., 302 F. Supp. 3d 730, 749 (E.D. Va. 2018) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n \n26 In a prior order (Doc. 127), the court applied intermediate scrutiny \nto HB2 in light of the fact that HB2 “classifie[d] citizens on the basis \nof ‘biological sex’” on its face (Id. at 48–49).  Since HB142 does not \nfacially classify individuals on the basis of sex — and indeed does not \nfacially classify or regulate individuals in any sense — the court’s \nstandard of scrutiny analysis from its prior order is of little help \nhere.  (See id. at 49 n.30 (expressly “declin[ing] to consider” the \nquestions of “whether transgender individuals qualify as a suspect class \nfor Equal Protection purposes” and “whether Plaintiffs have established \na sex stereotyping claim”).) \n57 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 57 of 64\n\ndetermination,  the  court  accords  some  deference  to  stated \nlegislative purposes.  See City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. \n297, 303 (1976) (“[T]he judiciary may not sit as a superlegislature \nto  judge  the  wisdom  or  desirability  of  legislative  policy \ndeterminations.”)    Next,  the  court  determines  whether  the \nchallenged “classification utilized by the statute is ‘rationally \nrelated’” to that legitimate governmental purpose.  Sylvia, 48 \nF.3d at 820 (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 \nU.S. 432, 440 (1985)).  While the substantive standard for rational \nbasis review ultimately “requires the government to win if any set \nof  facts  reasonably  may  be  conceived  to  justify  its \nclassification,”  this  lenient  standard  must  not  be  allowed  to \n“defeat  the  plaintiff’s  benefit  of  the  broad  Rule  12(b)(6) \nstandard” at the motion to dismiss stage.  Giarratano v. Johnson, \n521 F.3d 298, 303 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Wroblewski v. City of \nWashburn, 965 F.2d 452, 459 (7th Cir. 1992)).  Ultimately, “[t]o \nsurvive  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to  state  a  claim,  a \nplaintiff must allege facts sufficient to overcome the presumption \nof rationality that applies to government classifications.”  Id. \nat 304 (quoting Wroblewski, 965 F.2d at 460). \nOn the initial question of whether the stated governmental \npurpose for HB142 is legitimate, the court is hampered by the fact \nthat the legislation is accompanied by no policy statement.  Nor \ndo Intervenor-Defendants offer any possible governmental purpose \n58 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 58 of 64\n\nfor HB142’s preemption provisions in their briefing, noting only \nthat the law is the result of “a complex bipartisan compromise.”  \n(Doc. 234 at 3 n.1.)  It is in fact Plaintiffs who hint at the \nmost  plausible  purpose  for  HB142’s  preemption  provisions:  that \nthey  are  intended  to  prevent  an  uneven  patchwork  of  anti-\ndiscrimination laws across the State, in order to head off the \nsort of uproar that led to — and followed — the passage of HB2.  \n(See Doc. 210 ¶ 331.)  To this notion, Plaintiffs respond: \n[T]he government cannot assert an interest in consistent \nstatewide obligations given that (1) H.B. 142 in fact \nleaves  in  place  local  government  non-discrimination \nordinances that were enacted prior to the passage of \nH.B. 2 . . . and cities have announced their intent to \ncontinue enforcing them; (2) H.B. 142 does not preempt \nlocal governments, school boards, universities, or other \nstate agencies or branches of government from enacting \nnon-discrimination rules or regulations with regard to \ntheir own employees or students, or with respect to the \nservices  they  provide  to  citizens;  (3)  H.B.  142’s \n“preemption” is specified to end in December 2020.  In \naddition,  there  is  no  greater  need  for  statewide \nuniformity with respect to antidiscrimination laws than \nthere is with respect to numerous other laws as to which \nNorth Carolina does not prohibit local regulation and as \nto  which  there  are  significant  differences  in \nregulations  of  conduct  among  different  parts  of  the \nstate . . . . \n(Id.)  As a result, Plaintiffs argue, any governmental purpose for \nHB142’s preemption provisions resting on statewide uniformity can \nonly be a “pretext” for the same sort of discrimination that was \nmore explicit in HB2.  (Id.)  Given the lack of briefing from \nDefendants on this issue, the lack of any clearly stated purpose \nfor  the  law,  the  plausible  arguments  made  by  Plaintiffs  in \n59 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 59 of 64\n\nopposition to the conceivable purpose of statewide uniformity, and \nthe standard of review at this early pleading stage, the court \nfinds that — while the question is a close one — Plaintiffs have \n“allege[d]  facts  sufficient  to  overcome  the  presumption  of \nrationality” as to Section 3 at this time.  Giarratano, 521 F.3d \nat 304 (quoting Wroblewski, 965 F.2d at 460); see Mary’s House, \nInc. v. North Carolina, 976 F. Supp. 2d 691, 704 (M.D.N.C. 2013) \n(“Plaintiffs do more than present conclusory assertions . . . . \nThe complaint therefore alleges sufficient facts to overcome the \npresumption of rationality at this early stage.  Whether Plaintiffs \ncan ultimately meet the high bar in proving Defendants lacked any \nrational basis for the [challenged classification] remains to be \nseen.”). \nIn conclusion, because Plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded both \ndiscriminatory intent and lack of a rational basis for Section 3, \ntheir equal protection claim against Section 3 survives the motions \nto dismiss as to the Executive Branch Defendants.27 \n                     \n27 Intervenor-Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ claims should be \ndismissed  as  contrary  to  the  Tenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution (Doc. 225 at 21), which forbids the “commandeer[ing]” of \nstate legislatures by Congress “by directly compelling them to enact and \nenforce a federal regulatory program.”  New York v. United States, 505 \nU.S. 144, 161 (1992).  Intervenor-Defendants base this argument on the \ntheory  that  Plaintiffs  are  asking  the  court  to  mandate  that  “North \nCarolina  officials  .  .  .  enact  and  administer  access  and  non-\ndiscrimination policies that do not now exist.”  (Doc. 225 at 21.)  Even \nto the extent Plaintiffs’ requested relief could be characterized in the \nmanner  Defendants  suggest  —  which  is  at  odds  with  Plaintiffs’  own \nassertion that “Plaintiffs simply request that HB142 be struck down” \n(Doc.  233  at  45)  —  an  improperly-stated  request  for  relief  is  not \n60 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 60 of 64\n\n2.  Nominal Damages Claims \nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that, regardless of the outcome of \ntheir claims against HB142, they have claims for nominal damages \nagainst the UNC Defendants for “violations of their Title IX and \nTitle  VII  rights . . . that  occurred  while  HB2  was  in  force.”  \n(Doc. 233 at 11 n.3.)  In their brief, Plaintiffs relegate this \nclaim to a footnote and decline to make any argument or cite any \ncases in support of their position.  (Id.)  The complaint is no \nmore illuminating.  (Doc. 210 ¶¶ 18, 391–403.) \n  The UNC Defendants contend that under Titles VII and IX, a \ndefendant can be liable only for its own conduct, or the conduct \nof its agents.  (Doc. 223 at 29.)  They note that, under this \nprinciple, Plaintiffs may not “seek damages from the University \n‘for the harms caused by H.B. 2’s violation of’” Titles IX and VII \nbecause the UNC Defendants played no part in the enactment of HB2 \nand because Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint does “not suggest \nthat the University in fact enforced HB 2 against any of [the \n                     \nnormally grounds for dismissal of a complaint.  Charles v. Front Royal \nVolunteer Fire and Rescue Dept., Inc., 21 F. Supp. 3d 620, 629 (W.D. Va. \n2014) (“[T]he nature of the relief included in the demand for judgment \nis immaterial to the question of whether a complaint adequately states \na claim upon which relief can be granted.” (citation omitted)); 5 Charles \nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1255 (3d ed. 2018) \n(“[T]he selection of an improper remedy in the Rule 8(a)(3) demand for \nrelief will not be fatal to a party’s pleading if the statement of the \nclaim indicates the pleader may be entitled to relief of some other \ntype.”); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c) (“[A] final judgment should grant \nthe relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not \ndemanded  that  relief  in  its  pleadings.”).    As  a  result,  the  Tenth \nAmendment does not preclude Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim. \n61 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 61 of 64\n\nPlaintiffs].”  (Id. (quoting Doc. 210 ¶ 18).)  The UNC Defendants \nalso argue that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any adherence \nto HB2 would have violated Titles IX and VII, as both statutes \npermit the maintenance of separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex.  (Id. at 29–30.) \n  The briefing on these claims is wholly inadequate for proper \nresolution.  As such, decision on this issue will be withheld \nwithout prejudice to the parties rearguing it upon further request \nand further briefing.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(i). \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, the court finds that Plaintiffs have \nplausibly alleged an equal protection claim against Sections 3 and \n428  of  HB142  as  to  the  Executive  Branch  Defendants  and  that \nPlaintiffs’ potential claims against HB2 should not be dismissed \non ripeness grounds at this time.  The court defers ruling on \nPlaintiffs’ claims for nominal damages for the alleged Title IX \nand Title VII violations that occurred while HB2 was in effect \nagainst them.  In all other respects, the motions to dismiss are \ngranted. \n                     \n28 Section 4 only states that “[t]his act is effective when it becomes \nlaw” and that “Section 3 of this act expires on December 1, 2020.”  HB142 \n§  4.  Since  the  operative  language  relevant  to  Plaintiffs’  equal \nprotection claim is found in Section 3, the foregoing opinion has treated \nthat section exclusively.  But since Section 4 modifies Section 3, and \nsince Plaintiffs also make their equal protection claim against Section \n4, that claim currently survives to the same extent it survives as to \nSection 3. \n62 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 62 of 64\n\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file the declaration of \nEricka Myers (Doc. 236) is DENIED. \n2.  The motion to dismiss by the UNC Defendants (Doc. 222) \nis GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART in that the claims in Counts \n1 and 2 against them, as well as the claims in Counts 6 and 7 \npertaining to HB142, are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, but that the \nclaims against them in Counts 3, 4, and 5 survive.  The court \nreserves ruling on the nominal damages claims brought against them \nfor the period of time when HB2 was in effect against them as found \nin Counts 6 and 7. \n3.  The  motion  to  dismiss  by  Intervenor-Defendants  (Doc. \n221) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, in that the claims in \nCount 1, along with the equal protection claim in Count 2 as to \nSection 2 of HB142, are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, but that the \nequal protection claim in Count 2 as to Sections 3 and 4 of HB142, \nas well as the claims in Counts 3, 4, and 5, survive. \n4.  Any  party  wishing  to  submit  additional  briefing \nregarding Plaintiffs’ nominal damages claims for the period of \ntime when HB2 was in effect against Plaintiffs must do so within \n30 days of the issuance of this order. \n5.  As per the court’s prior order (Doc. 228), any party \nwishing to submit additional briefing as to the joint motion for \nentry of a consent decree must do so within 30 days of the issuance \n63 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 248   Filed 09/30/18   Page 63 of 64\n\nof this order.  In light of the court’s ruling in the present \norder, the court directs all parties to meet and confer prior to \nthe filing of such additional briefing to determine whether any \nagreement can be reached as to the effect of the court’s rulings \non the joint motion. \n6.  As per the court’s prior order (Doc. 226), the Executive \nBranch Defendants are not required to serve an answer or other \nresponsive pleading to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint until \n30 days after the court’s disposition of the joint motion for entry \nof a consent decree. \n \n \n   /s/   Thomas D.

No. 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP \n   \nROY A. COOPER, III, et al., \n       \nDefendants, \n \n    and \n \nPHIL BERGER, et al.,  \n \nIntervenor-Defendants.  \n \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH DEFENDANTS’  \nJOINT MOTION FOR ENTRY OF A CONSENT DECREE \n \nNOW COME Plaintiffs Joaquín Carcaño, Payton Grey McGarry, Hunter Schafer, \nQuinton Harper, Angela Gilmore, Madeline Goss, and American Civil Liberties Union of \nNorth Carolina (collectively, “Plaintiffs”); and Defendants Roy A. Cooper III, Joshua \nStein, Machelle Sanders, Mandy K. Cohen, and James H. Trogdon III (collectively, \n“Executive Branch Defendants”) (Plaintiffs and Executive Branch Defendants are \ncollectively referred to herein as “the Parties”), by and through their attorneys, and move \nthe Court pursuant to Local Rule 7.1 for entry of a Consent Judgment and Decree, filed \nconcurrently with this motion.  In support thereof the Parties state as follows: \n1 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 216   Filed 10/18/17   Page 1 of 6\n\n \n1.  On September 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint, \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages (D.E. 210), alleging that \nPlaintiffs are entitled to relief from this Court for violations of their rights under the Due \nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e, et seq. \n2.  Since Plaintiffs moved the Court, with consent of all parties, to file their \nFourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs and the Executive Branch Defendants have \nengaged in substantial good faith negotiations about a potential settlement of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the Executive Branch Defendants. \n3.  The Parties request that the Court enter the Consent Judgment and Decree, \nfiled concurrently with this joint motion. \n4.  As set forth in the Consent Decree, with respect to public facilities that are \nsubject to the Executive Branch Defendants’ control or supervision, House Bill 142, \ncodified as Session Law 2017-4 (“H.B. 142”), does not prevent transgender people from \nthe use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.  See Consent \nJudgment and Decree at 5 ¶ 1. \n5.  The Consent Decree also permanently enjoins the Executive Branch \nDefendants, in their official capacities, and all successors, officers, and employees, from \ntaking certain specified actions under Section 2 of H.B. 142.  See Consent Judgment and \nDecree at 5 ¶ 2.   \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 216   Filed 10/18/17   Page 2 of 6\n\n \n6.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the Parties agree to each bear their own \nfees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the \nExecutive Branch Defendants, and all remaining claims Plaintiffs allege against the \nExecutive Branch Defendants in this action would be dismissed. \n7.  In support of this motion, the Parties submit Memoranda of Law, \naddressing all necessary elements for this Court’s entry of a consent decree. \n8.  The Parties seek leave to present oral argument in support of this Motion \npursuant to Local Rule 7.3(c)(1). \nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, and for those set forth in the Parties’ \nsupporting memoranda of law, the Parties respectfully move the Court to enter the \nConsent Judgment and Decree, filed concurrently with this joint motion, as a full and \nfinal resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims against the Executive Branch Defendants. \n*  *  * \n   \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00236-TDS-JEP   Document 216   Filed 10/18/17   Page 3 of 6\n\n \nDated: October 18, 2017  Respectfully submitted,   \n/s/ Christopher A.
