          "description": "ORDER granting in part and denying in part 71 Motion for Extension of Time to Complete Discovery. At 71, Defendants request a discovery extension in order to permit them to depose two expert witnesses and three fact witnesses. Defendants' motion is granted insofar as they seek to depose Plaintiff's two expert witnesses, but is denied in all other respects. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16 allows a party to obtain a modification of a scheduling order \"only for good cause and with the judge's consent.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). It is the movant's burden to establish good cause. See Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir. 2000); Nairobi Holdings Ltd. v. Brown Bros. Harriman & Co., 02 Civ. 1230 (LMM), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54171, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2006). \"Whether good cause exists turns on the diligence of the moving party.\" Holmes v. Grubman, 568 F.3d 329, 335 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \"With respect to a request to extend discovery, the moving party must show why it could not have completed the necessary discovery within the time frame established under the existing scheduling order.\" Kintetsu World Express (USA), Inc. v. Johnson Controls Inc., 14 Civ. 4947 (KAM), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169190, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2015). As per the Court's 12/23/2015 Order, depositions of fact witnesses were to be noticed by 12/31/2015, depositions of expert witnesses were to be noticed by 1/22/2016, and all discovery, including depositions, was to be completed by 2/5/2016. Defendants noticed the five requested depositions on 1/29/2016. According to Defendants' counsel, notice was provided at such a late stage because: (1) deposition testimony of their own clients and witnesses provided a sudden need to depose the three fact witnesses; and (2) documents belatedly received via subpoena from third-parties provided a need to depose Plaintiff's two expert witnesses. Plaintiff counters that the three fact witnesses Defendants seek to depose were identified long ago in Plaintiff's Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) disclosures and that the documents just recently received by Defendants are irrelevant to the assertions made by their experts. Defendants have not shown good cause to allow them to belatedly depose the three fact witnesses. Plaintiff identified these three fact witnesses in its Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) disclosures and, to the extent deposition testimony from Defendants or witnesses on their behalf provided some type of amorphous reason to depose these three fact witnesses, Defendants' counsel otherwise knew, or should have known, of this information prior to said depositions. This Court, however, will credit Defendants' counsel's claim that the documents just recently received via subpoena had an effect on their decision to depose Plaintiff's experts, thus triggering good cause to extend the discovery schedule only in that regard. In light of the foregoing, Defendants may depose Plaintiff's two experts by or before 3/11/2016. The parties' briefing schedule, as previously Ordered by the Court on 12/23/2015, is modified as follows: opening summary judgment briefs, including the statement of material facts, must besubmitted to the party in opposition by 4/11/2016. Briefs in opposition to summary judgment must be submitted by 5/9/2016. Reply briefs, if any, must be submitted by 5/23/2016. On the due date prescribed, briefs will be submitted to the party in opposition only. No brief will be filed with the Court until the close of the briefing period on 5/23/2016. At the close of the briefing period, any party who filed affirmatively for summary judgment will file its opening brief, the brief in opposition, and its reply brief. Ordered by Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon on 2/16/2016. (Weingarten, Richard)"

    "summary": "<p>The Fortune Society, a non-profit organization that provides temporary and permanent housing to hundreds of formerly incarcerated individuals each year, tried to rent apartments at The Sand Castle, an apartment complex managed and owned by the Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp. (the “Fund”). When the Fund learned that the Fortune Society served formerly imprisoned individuals, they refused to rent apartments. </p><p>On October 30, 2014, the Fortune Society filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiff sued the Fund (and related entities) under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and New York State and City law. Represented by Relman, Dane & Colfax, the plaintiff sought injunctive, monetary and declarative relief. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant maintained a discriminatory policy that prohibited anyone with a criminal record from renting an apartment or living at The Sand Castle. Specifically, they claimed that the policy had the purpose and effect of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos.</p><p>The court set up a discovery schedule, which proceeded for about a year. On May 1, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. </p><p>On June 25, 2015, the court ordered the parties to meet and discuss settlement in light of the recent Supreme Court decision <i>Inclusive Communities Project v. Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs</i>. (See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13857\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse). That opinion held that the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate impact liability, but emphasized that liability followed only if the challenged policy or practice actually caused, rather than merely accompanied, a racial disparity.</p><p>The plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment on its race discrimination claims based on disparate impact on September 30, 2016. On the same day, the defendant moved for summary judgment. The defendant claimed that summary judgment was appropriate because discovery confirmed that it did not maintain a blanket ban on residents with criminal records. </p><p>On November 16, 2015, the parties met at a status conference to discuss settlement, as recommended by the court. But they failed to agree. </p><p>On October 18, 2016, the United States entered a Statement of Interest. It suggested a three-step legal test that the court should use to evaluate the plaintiff's claims (Department of Justice press release available <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-brief-address-use-criminal-background-checks-housing-providers\">here</a>):<ol><li>The plaintiff must show the challenged practice has a discriminatory effect on a protected class;</li><li>The defendant must establish a legitimate justification for the challenged practice; and</li><li>The plaintiff must exhibit another policy to serve the same interests with less discriminatory effect.</li></ol>The court (Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon) issued an order denying the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and grating in part and denying in part the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on July 3, 2019. The court denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff’s disparate impact claim but granted it with respect to the plaintiff’s disparate treatment claim. In addition, the court scheduled a status conference on August 20, 2019, to discuss settlement possibilities. </p><p>The parties jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on October 11, 2019. On October 16, 2019, the defendant and the plaintiff filed a status report, stating that the matter has been resolved. According to the New York Daily News, the parties agreed to a $1,187,500 settlement. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-incarcerated-housing-suit-20191105-7nskiotbk5chpfxsqu5l2soxqu-story.html>article</a> did not mention any injunctive relief but did note that the Fund no longer controlled The Sand Castle or any other residential property. </p><p>This case is closed. </p><p></p>",

The Fortune Society (“Fortune”) brings this suit pursuant to the Fair Housing Act \nof 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., for injunctive, monetary and declarative relief \nagainst Defendants Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corporation (“HDFC”), \nSarasota Gold LLC (“Sarasota Gold”), E & M Associates LLC (“E & M”), and Weissman Realty \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 2 of 44 PageID #: 283\n \nGroup LLC (“Weissman”) for engaging in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination on the \nbasis of race and color at The Sand Castle, a multi-building apartment complex they own and \nmanage in Queens, New York.  Specifically, Defendants maintain and enforce a policy of \nautomatically excluding any person with a record of a criminal conviction from renting or living \nin an apartment at The Sand Castle.  Defendants explicitly confirmed this policy to Fortune twice \nin the summer of 2013.  The policy excludes all such people regardless of the nature of the \nconviction, the amount of time that has lapsed since the conviction, evidence of rehabilitation, or \nany other factor related to whether a specific person poses any threat to safety.  Pursuant to this \nstated policy, Defendants repeatedly refused to permit Fortune to rent apartments at The Sand \nCastle on behalf of its clients because those clients have criminal histories.1  Defendants’ policy \nhas the purpose and effect of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos, including \nFortune’s clients, in violation of the Fair Housing Act and New York State and City law. \n2.  Fortune is a not-for-profit organization that for nearly fifty years has been \ndedicated to the successful reentry and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals in New \nYork City (“the City”).  It is one of the leading organizations in the country addressing and \nhelping individuals overcome reentry issues.  Fortune has been lauded nationally and \ninternationally for the innovation, quality, and effectiveness of its programs.  Just this summer \nFortune’s Senior Vice President of Programs, himself a formerly incarcerated African-American \nman, was named a “Champion of Change” by the White House for his work at Fortune. \n3.  Fortune serves approximately 5,000 clients a year.  Approximately 95% of its \nclients are African-American or Latino.  Fortune provides comprehensive services to these \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this Complaint, “criminal history” and “criminal record” refer to a prior criminal conviction. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 3 of 44 PageID #: 284\n \nclients by operating housing, education, employment, health, and case management programs, \namong others. \n4.  One of Fortune’s principal tasks is to secure housing for its clients and their \nfamilies.  Fortune provides temporary and permanent housing for hundreds of formerly \nincarcerated individuals each year.  It does so by running “scattered-site” programs that place \nclients in private rental housing throughout the City and by operating two housing facilities itself \nin West Harlem.  The two facilities are The Fortune Academy and Castle Gardens. \n5.  Many of Fortune’s housing programs work as a pipeline, with individuals moving \nfrom emergency to “phased permanent” to permanent housing as part of their successful \nreintegration.  Being able to move people to the end of the pipeline opens up more space at the \nbeginning and allows Fortune to serve more clients. \n6.  In some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs, Fortune leases apartments and pays \nthe rent itself.  Its clients provide some reimbursement, which encourages a sense of personal \ninvestment and responsibility.  Some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs serve specific \nsegments of the formerly-incarcerated population, such as people who are HIV-positive, or \ncertain regions of the City.  Fortune has developed relationships with over 100 landlords to \nfacilitate its scattered-site housing and regularly seeks out new locations for these programs. \n7.  The Fortune Academy includes an 18-bed emergency housing unit and a “phased-\npermanent” unit that serves 41 people who transfer from the emergency unit when Fortune staff \ndetermine they are ready to live independently, subject to the availability of space.  Individuals \nstay in the phased-permanent housing until they are ready to transition to permanent housing \nelsewhere.  Such permanent housing is often located through Fortune’s scattered-site programs.  \nAt Castle Gardens, Fortune provides affordable permanent housing that integrates formerly-\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 4 of 44 PageID #: 285\n \nincarcerated people with other low-income families.  The demand for space at Fortune Academy \nand Castle Gardens substantially exceeds the space that is available. \n8.  In the summer of 2013 and again in early 2014, Fortune tried to rent apartments \nfor its clients at The Sand Castle under one of its scattered-site programs that required that \napartments be located in Queens.  The Sand Castle is a four-building apartment complex with \nover 900 rental units in Far Rockaway, Queens.  It is owned and managed by Defendants.  \nFortune wanted to rent units at The Sand Castle because the complex is an ideal fit for its clients: \namong other things, The Sand Castle suits Fortune’s clients well because it is located in a safe \nand racially diverse community that is readily accessible to public transportation, which its \nclients rely on heavily.  In addition, units at The Sand Castle fit the budget for the scattered-site \nprogram. \n9.  When Defendants learned that Fortune serves formerly incarcerated individuals \nwho would live in the apartments Fortune wanted to rent, they refused to rent apartments to \nFortune.  This refusal, they told Fortune, was because they maintain and enforce a policy \nprohibiting anyone with a criminal record from renting an apartment or living at The Sand \nCastle.  This type of “blanket ban” policy has become increasingly common in housing due to \nthe increased accessibility of inexpensive background checks via the Internet.  As a direct result \nof Defendants’ repeated application of their blanket ban policy against Fortune, some of \nFortune’s clients have been forced to remain homeless or in substandard or unsafe housing \nsubstantially longer than they otherwise would have while Fortune searched for alternative \nhousing.  In several cases, clients found eligible for scattered-site housing in the Queens program \nwere residing in The Fortune Academy and had to remain there longer than necessary, thus \noccupying beds that could have been utilized to house other homeless individuals. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 5 of 44 PageID #: 286\n \n10.  Defendants’ actions have directly and significantly diminished and frustrated \nFortune’s ability to provide safe and stable housing for its clients, which is a central part of its \nmission of assisting formerly-incarcerated individuals with reentry and reintegration.  In addition \nto frustrating Fortune’s ability to provide housing to its clients, these actions have caused \nFortune to expend substantial additional resources to identify alternative housing options for its \nclients and to increase advocacy efforts, and forced Fortune to divert resources from other \nprogrammatic activities to counteract Defendants’ conduct. \n11.  Locally and nationally, blanket bans like the one maintained and enforced by \nDefendants against Fortune are discriminatory and have a clear and unlawful disparate impact on \nAfrican Americans and Latinos.  The disproportionate rates of conviction and incarceration of \nAfrican Americans and Latinos, as compared to whites, are well-documented.2  This \ndisproportionality is clear in New York City, New York State, and the United States as a whole.  \nAfrican Americans and Latinos are likewise significantly overrepresented compared to whites \namong individuals released from prison each year, i.e., Fortune’s clients.  Banning people from \nsafe and affordable housing based solely on a criminal conviction thereby has a predictable and \nlarge adverse impact on African Americans and Latinos.  In the analogous context of \nemployment bans, this is exactly what the United States Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (“EEOC”) has found by analyzing national criminal records data.3 \n12.  Analysis of criminal records and other data likewise shows that the blanket ban \nmaintained by Defendants at The Sand Castle has a severe disparate impact on the basis of race \nand color.  African-American men who live in New York City and satisfy Defendants’ other \n                                                 \n2 “White” is used herein to refer to non-Hispanic Caucasians. \n \n3 See generally U.S. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n, EEOC Enforcement Guidance, Number 915.002 (Apr. 25, \n2012), http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 6 of 44 PageID #: 287\n \nresidency requirements for The Sand Castle are at least three times as likely as whites to be \nexcluded by Defendants’ prohibition against people with records, and Latino men are almost four \nand one-half times as likely as whites to be excluded.  The disparities may actually be much \ngreater because these figures are based on a conservative statistical analysis.  \n13.  Under the Fair Housing Act and New York law, a policy that has a disparate \nimpact may be permissible if it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose that cannot \nbe satisfied with a less discriminatory alternative.  That is not the case here.  A clear and \nobviously less discriminatory alternative for dealing with any potential concerns raised by \napplicants with criminal records is available to Defendants – one that is already established in the \narea of employment discrimination law and regulation. \n14.   Instead of applying a blanket ban, Defendants could assess potential residents \nwith criminal records individually by considering factors directly relevant to appropriate \nqualifications for tenancy.  This could include the nature of the conviction or conduct, how long \nago it occurred, the age of the person at the time of the conviction, post-conviction and post-\nrelease conduct, evidence of rehabilitation, evidence of any current threat to safety, letters of \nrecommendation, the individual’s history as a tenant and as a whole, and other factors.  The \nEEOC applies a presumption in the employment context that, because of the racially disparate \nimpact of blanket bans, precisely such an individualized assessment is required by law and \nsufficient to protect legitimate interests such as safety.4  The EEOC’s sound rationale applies \nwith equal force to housing. \n15.  Through an individualized assessment, Defendants would maintain the ability to \nreview carefully all Sand Castle applicants while permitting prospective tenants who have \n                                                 \n4 Id. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 7 of 44 PageID #: 288\n \ncriminal records, but pose no realistic threat to the community, to obtain housing.  This more \ntailored approach would protect public safety equally well, yet it would be less discriminatory \nand exclusionary because it would reduce the number of African Americans and Latinos \nprevented from securing housing at The Sand Castle.    \n16.  Using individualized assessments to reduce the impact of blanket bans, including \nDefendants’ blanket ban at The Sand Castle, is crucial both for individuals who were formerly \nincarcerated and for the health of our communities.  Recidivism rates are much higher for \nreentrants who do not find safe and permanent housing, and recidivism impacts the whole \nsurrounding community.  For Fortune’s clients and other reentrants, successful reintegration \ngreatly depends on having a suitable home.  Quite properly, housing has been called the \n“lynchpin that holds the reintegration process together.”5 \n17.  The importance to individuals and communities of promoting successful \nreintegration by meeting the housing needs of the formerly incarcerated has grown alongside the \nrapid growth in the number of people imprisoned in the United States.  In 1980, 300,000 people \nin the United States were imprisoned.  Today over 2.3 million are imprisoned, many for non-\nviolent crimes.  Nearly everyone who is currently imprisoned will be released and will need to \nfind housing.  Moreover, the pace of people being released will increase in the near term because \nthe United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to reduce sentencing ranges for \ncertain drug offenses and to apply the changes retroactively where justified by individualized \nconsideration, and because of a large-scale initiative by the United States to expedite \n                                                 \n5 Jeremy Travis, But They All Come Back: Facing Challenges of Prisoner Reentry 219 (2005). \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 8 of 44 PageID #: 289\n \nconsideration of clemency for the many non-violent, low-level federal offenders who have \nalready served substantial time in prison.6 \n18.  Blanket bans maintained by Defendants and other landlords, however, present \nformidable and often insurmountable obstacles for formerly incarcerated individuals like \nFortune’s clients.  By blocking the path to safe, permanent, and affordable housing, these bans \nalso block the path to social and economic stability for many otherwise qualified and deserving \npeople without regard to the nature of their past crime or how far they have since come.  Blanket \nbans also create a chilling effect, discouraging potential tenants from even applying for tenancy \nin the first place.  Eliminating such unnecessary obstacles from their paths is both sound policy \nand required by the Fair Housing Act.    \n19.  Defendants’ blanket ban is based on racially discriminatory stereotypes about \nthose with criminal records.  Indeed, the discriminatory impact of Defendants’ policy is so large, \nand the less discriminatory alternative so obvious, that unlawful racially discriminatory intent \ncan be inferred.  Fortune contends that Defendants knew that people with criminal records, \nincluding Fortune’s clients, are disproportionately African-American and Latino.  Defendants \nunderstood the adverse impact their policy has on the racial make-up of its property, and \ndeliberately and purposefully pursued that outcome.   \n20.  Defendants’ deliberate and purposeful conduct is consistent with their other \nefforts to remake the image of The Sand Castle after Defendant Sarasota Gold purchased it in \n2006.  Defendants employed measures to attract wealthier white tenants and gentrify the \n                                                 \n6 See generally U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, Office of Research and Data, Summary of Key Data Regarding \nRetroactive Application of the 2014 Drug Guidelines Amendment (July 25, 2014), \nhttp://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/retroactivity-analyses/drug-guidelines-\namendment/20140725-Drug-Retro-Analysis.pdf.

These efforts are consistent with \nengaging in intentional discrimination in order to limit the number of minority tenants in the \nbuilding. \n21.

THE FORTUNE SOCIETY AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO RENT APARTMENTS \nFOR ITS CLIENTS AT THE SAND CASTLE   \n \nA.  Fortune’s Mission and Programs \n33.  Founded in 1967, The Fortune Society’s mission is to help incarcerated and \nformerly incarcerated individuals become contributing members of society and to offer \nalternatives to incarceration.  Fortune offers a holistic array of programs for formerly \nincarcerated, low-income persons in New York City through a “one-stop shop” model of services \nthat includes housing, case management, counseling, education, employment services, substance \nabuse treatment, family services, health services, and mental health services, among others.  \nFortune routinely engages in education and advocacy to promote the creation of a fair, humane, \nand truly rehabilitative correctional system. \n34.  Fortune serves approximately 5,000 individuals annually.  African Americans and \nLatinos comprise over 95% of Fortune’s clients. \n35.  Fortune is widely regarded as one of the leading organizations in the country \nconfronting the myriad reentry issues faced by formerly incarcerated individuals.  Fortune’s \nprograms are recognized nationally and internationally for their innovation, quality, and \neffectiveness, including in reducing rates of recidivism.  Just this summer the White House \nnamed Fortune’s Senior Vice-President of Programs a “Champion of Change” for his \neffectiveness in helping formerly incarcerated men and women achieve and maintain \nemployment.  Also this summer, Governor Cuomo appointed Fortune’s CEO to the new \nstatewide Council on Community Re-Entry and Reintegration.  Fortune’s housing has been \nfunded as a Special Project of National Significance by the United States Health Resources and \nServices Administration and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 13 of 44 PageID #: 294\n \n(“HUD”) and Fortune has received accolades from numerous organizations as a provider of \nmodel reentry programs.   \n36.  Because of the vital importance of safe and stable housing to successful reentry, \none of Fortune’s principal tasks is to secure housing for its clients and their families.  This is \ncentral to Fortune’s mission.  Each year Fortune provides temporary or permanent housing for \nmore than 300 formerly incarcerated people.   \n37.  Many of Fortune’s housing programs, described immediately below, work \ntogether as a pipeline.  Clients move from emergency to phased-permanent units at the Fortune \nAcademy, and then to permanent housing.  Moving clients from temporary to permanent housing \nis of critical importance to this process.  By helping clients who are ready to live independently \nmove from Fortune’s temporary housing to permanent housing, Fortune creates additional space \nin its temporary housing programs.  Without this additional space, Fortune cannot serve new \nclients in need of emergency or phased-permanent housing.  Fortune always faces a backlog of \npeople who need its help in securing such housing. \n1.  Emergency and Phased-Permanent Housing: Fortune Academy \n \n38.  The Fortune Academy is a housing facility in West Harlem that is owned and \noperated by The Fortune Society.  The Fortune Academy offers both emergency and phased-\npermanent housing for approximately 60 formerly incarcerated individuals who are homeless. \n39.  In addition to providing housing, The Fortune Academy works with participants \nto develop needed tools for social reintegration, employment, independence, sobriety, and the \ntransition to the private mainstream housing market.  Through these extensive reentry services \nand programs, Fortune Academy residents learn how to address the issues that led to their \nincarceration and homelessness.  This comprehensive approach is instrumental to the success of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 14 of 44 PageID #: 295\n \nFortune’s housing clients in achieving and maintaining positive, self-sufficient, and crime-free \nlives.  \n40.  The Fortune Academy’s emergency housing unit includes 18 beds plus some \noverflow capacity.  Rooms in the emergency unit house three to seven people at a time and do \nnot include cooking facilities.   \n41.  Demand for emergency beds at The Fortune Academy is always high because \nmany people are released every week from jail and prison into local communities and have no \nviable housing options.  The emergency unit is consistently filled to capacity, and Fortune is \nconstantly forced to turn people away.   \n42.  The emergency unit’s waiting list is frequently several months long.  Making as \nmany beds available as possible is critical to Fortune’s mission. \n43.  Fortune’s model is to move individuals housed in the emergency unit to \ntransitional or permanent housing within 45 days, but individuals often stay for as many as eight \nor nine months, in part because there are so few affordable housing options available to the \nformerly incarcerated in New York City.  This is due in significant part to blanket bans on people \nwith criminal records imposed by private landlords. \n44.  Fortune clients who have been in emergency housing and are assessed by Fortune \nAcademy staff as ready to live independently are eligible for placement in the Academy’s \nphased-permanent unit if space is available.   \n45.  The phased-permanent unit houses 41 people.  Rooms in the phased-permanent \nprogram are apartment-style singles or doubles that include amenities such as cooking \nequipment. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 15 of 44 PageID #: 296\n \n46.  When a vacancy opens in the phased-permanent unit, Academy staff select an \nindividual from the emergency unit who has demonstrated his or her readiness to live more \nindependently with the help of continued supportive services from Fortune. \n47.  Fortune clients housed in the phased-permanent unit typically remain there until \nthey can make the transition to permanent housing.  The process of finding and moving into \npermanent housing often takes a year or more, again in significant part because of blanket bans \nthat exclude individuals with criminal histories from living in rental housing.  \n2.  Permanent Housing: Scattered-Site Programs and Castle Gardens \n \n48.  Fortune also operates programs to provide safe and stable permanent housing for \nits clients, including several scattered-site programs.  \n49.  Fortune’s scattered-site programs are initiatives through which Fortune places \nclients in private rental housing throughout New York City.  Through these programs, Fortune \nhas developed relationships with New York City landlords and management companies to \nidentify safe and affordable apartments for clients who Fortune determines are ready to live \nindependently. \n50.  Fortune places its scattered-site clients through a variety of methods.  Some \nclients are placed in private housing owned or managed by landlords or management companies \nwith which Fortune already has an established relationship.  Other clients are placed in private \nhousing with the assistance of a licensed real-estate broker retained by Fortune for that specific \npurpose.  Housing specialists on Fortune’s staff also actively seek out new private landlords who \nare willing to house its clients. \n51.  Fortune itself often enters into residential leases with participating landlords.  In \nthese circumstances, Fortune is responsible for making all rental payments to the landlord.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 16 of 44 PageID #: 297\n \nScattered-site program participants then enter into an occupancy agreement with Fortune and \npartially reimburse Fortune for a share of the rent each month by paying 30% of their income to \nFortune.  Partial reimbursement facilitates a sense of personal investment and responsibility \nwhile maintaining affordability for Fortune’s clients. \n52.  The scattered-site programs are funded from a variety of public and private \ngrants.  The grants Fortune receives often have geographical or programmatic restrictions.  This \nmeans that Fortune may only be able to use a grant to house clients in a particular area of the \nCity or to assist only a specific subset of its client population, such as people who are HIV-\npositive.  Potential participants in Fortune’s scattered-site programs are carefully evaluated by \nFortune’s staff to assess their readiness for independent living and their fit for specific programs.  \nIf Fortune staff determine that an individual is an appropriate candidate for a program, Fortune’s \nhousing specialists begin the process of helping that person find an apartment in the private \nrental market.  Fortune’s own Castle Gardens is one option for clients who are ready for \npermanent housing, but it is a very limited one.  Castle Gardens is a 114-unit residential building \nin West Harlem that Fortune opened in 2010.  It provides homes and on-site social services for \nformerly-incarcerated people as well as other low-income families.  Openings are infrequent and \nunpredictable, however.  Like any other typical apartment building in New York City, once an \nindividual becomes a Castle Gardens resident, he or she may remain there indefinitely.  As a \nresult, Fortune typically cannot look to Castle Gardens to solve its need to locate housing for \nclients who are prepared to succeed in permanent housing. \nB.  Fortune’s Inability to Rent Apartments for Clients at The Sand Castle \nBecause of Defendants’ Blanket Criminal Record Ban \n \n53.  Due to the perpetual need to expand housing options for its prospective and \ncurrent clients, Fortune’s staff is constantly searching for more private landlords willing to house \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 17 of 44 PageID #: 298\n \nFortune clients through its scattered-site programs.  As part of this search, Fortune attempted to \nplace clients at The Sand Castle, a large apartment complex in Far Rockaway, Queens, which is \nowned by Defendants Sarasota Gold and HDFC and has been managed on the owners’ behalf by \nDefendants Weissman and E & M.  \n54.  Defendant Sarasota Gold bought The Sand Castle in or around 2006 for $98 \nmillion.  While the building had been largely occupied by seniors, the new owners planned an \nimage makeover and raised their rents.  Posters were placed in the lobby encouraging potential \ntenants to “Live the Life You’ve Always Dreamed.”  Advertisements for the complex and The \nSand Castle website featured smiling young, white, blond models.  Unit floor plans were labeled \nwith British-sounding references like “Ardsley,” “Dover,” and “Stanton.”  Defendants’ goal was \nto present a more “upscale,” gentrified image, one that deemphasized the presence of minority \nneighbors. \n55.  Fortune became aware of The Sand Castle after receiving a housing assistance \ngrant from New York State in 2013 that provides funding for exactly 25 residential units in \nQueens.   \n56.  Through its research, Fortune determined that The Sand Castle would be an ideal \nsite to house program participants.  Specifically, The Sand Castle is located in a relatively safe \nand racially diverse area within the grant’s geographical limitation, and in a neighborhood in \nwhich there are already Fortune clients.  Having a number of clients located in the same \ngeographical area allows Fortune to more effectively utilize its case management staff by \nreducing travel time, reducing costs, and supporting greater intensity of services.   \n57.  The waterfront property features numerous amenities, including a fitness center, \nsupermarket, on-site medical facilities, and a doorman.  The Jewish Association Serving the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 18 of 44 PageID #: 299\n \nAging has facilities located in the building.  The Sand Castle is also convenient to public \ntransportation relied upon by Fortune’s clients.    \n58.  Additionally, and of critical importance to Fortune, The Sand Castle’s rents are \naffordable and fit well within Fortune’s grant budget.  Studio apartments are available for as little \nas approximately $1,000 per month and one-bedroom apartments start at approximately $1,300 \nper month.    \n59.  The Sand Castle has over 900 apartments and, upon information and belief, has \nhad sufficient availability at all times relevant to this Complaint to provide units to Fortune \nand/or its clients. \n60.  In or around May 2013, in a transaction handled by Fortune’s then real-estate \nagent, Fortune entered into leases with Defendant Sarasota Gold for four apartments at The Sand \nCastle.  Fortune is listed as the tenant for each apartment and is solely responsible for all rental \npayments pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements.  \n61.  At the time that Defendants entered into these lease agreements with Fortune, The \nSand Castle’s management knew that Fortune intended to use the units for its housing program \nand that it intended to sub-lease the apartments to program clients.  The Sand Castle’s \nmanagement did not know, however, the nature of the Fortune program or that Fortune served \nindividuals with criminal records.  Moreover, Defendants had no specific knowledge that \nFortune’s sub-lessees had criminal records.  The Sand Castle did not request any financial or \nother background information from Fortune about potential sub-lessees. \n62.  In or around July 2013, a Fortune housing specialist visited The Sand Castle’s \nleasing office to pick up keys for the apartments that had been leased to Fortune.  While there, \nthe housing specialist asked a Sand Castle employee about the possibility of Fortune leasing \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 19 of 44 PageID #: 300\n \nmore apartments in the building for its clients.  The employee responded that Fortune would \nneed to contact building management.  Fortune subsequently contacted The Sand Castle’s \nmanagement on several occasions to explore the possibility of leasing additional apartments to \nhouse more Fortune clients.  The individuals with whom Fortune staff members spoke on these \noccasions were, upon information and belief, employees or agents of Defendant Weissman \nand/or Defendant E & M. \n63.  During Fortune’s encounters with Weissman and/or E & M, Weissman and/or E \n& M learned that Fortune serves clients who have criminal records.  Upon learning that \nFortune’s clients have criminal records, Weissman and/or E & M immediately denied Fortune’s \nrequest to lease any more apartments at The Sand Castle.  In doing so, Weissman and/or E & M \nexplicitly and unequivocally told Fortune’s staff that The Sand Castle’s apartments are not \navailable to people with criminal records.  \n64.  The first of these discussions with Weissman took place in the summer of 2013 \nwhen a Fortune staff member spoke with Melissa Gursky, a Weissman employee, who was \nworking in a Sand Castle management capacity.  Fortune explained the organization’s mission \nand programs.  In response, Ms. Gursky articulated The Sand Castle’s blanket ban policy, \nexplicitly telling the Fortune staff member that The Sand Castle “does not house ex-offenders” \n(or similar words to that effect).  \n65.  Also in the summer of 2013, a different Fortune staff member called Weissman \nand/or E & M.  The Fortune employee explained that he worked for Fortune, that Fortune helps \nformerly incarcerated people find housing, and that Fortune was interested in leasing additional \napartments at The Sand Castle.  In response, Weissman and/or E & M stated that, “we don’t \nallow ex-offenders on the property and we do not rent to programs” (or similar words to that \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 20 of 44 PageID #: 301\n \neffect).  The assertion that The Sand Castle does not rent to programs was demonstrably false \nbecause Defendants had leased apartments to Fortune in the spring knowing that it was a \n“program” (but not knowing the nature of the program). \n66.  In this same conversation, Fortune explained that the stated ban on the formerly \nincarcerated “appears to be discriminatory” (or similar words to that effect).  Weissman and/or E \n& M responded by repeating that The Sand Castle does not accept formerly incarcerated \nindividuals as residents.  Fortune asked when the exclusionary policy was adopted, but \nWeissman refused to answer. \n67.  Although Weissman and/or E & M made clear that The Sand Castle does not \npermit residents with criminal records, Defendants agreed to honor the leases that Defendant \nSarasota Gold had entered into with Fortune when it was unaware that Fortune’s clients were \nformerly incarcerated individuals. \n68.  Fortune again contacted The Sand Castle in early 2014 to determine whether \nDefendants had rescinded their blanket ban against people with criminal records and whether \nFortune could lease additional apartments for its clients.  Fortune’s employee spoke with E & \nM’s employee, Sruly Tress. \n69.  Fortune first confirmed that The Sand Castle had vacant apartments available for \nrent.  Fortune told Mr. Tress that its clients have criminal backgrounds and reminded Mr. Tress \nthat Fortune had clients who had been living in the building without incident.  Mr. Tress \nexplicitly acknowledged that The Sand Castle had not experienced any problems with those \nresidents.  Fortune made clear that it was willing to provide Defendants with any information \nthey reasonably required regarding the backgrounds of individual tenants who would occupy the \napartments that Fortune wanted to rent. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 21 of 44 PageID #: 302\n \n70.  Mr. Tress responded by telling Fortune that tenants with criminal histories “scare” \nmanagement and that criminal records are a “red flag.”  He did, however, state that he would \ncheck with Defendants’ upper-level management about whether Fortune would be permitted to \nrent additional units.   \n71.  Mr. Tress contacted Fortune shortly thereafter and told Fortune it would not be \nallowed to lease additional units in The Sand Castle.  Mr. Tress told Fortune that The Sand \nCastle did not wish to conduct any further business with Fortune. \nII.  DEFENDANTS’ REJECTION OF FORTUNE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR \nBLANKET BAN AGAINST RESIDENTS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS \nCONSTITUTES UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION \n \n72.  Facially neutral housing practices that have a disparate impact on the basis of race \nor color are prohibited by the Fair Housing Act unless they are necessary to achieve a legitimate \nbusiness purpose that cannot be satisfied through a less discriminatory alternative practice.  \nBlanket bans that automatically deny housing to people with criminal records, including the \nblanket ban maintained and enforced by Defendants at The Sand Castle, are unlawful under this \nstandard.  Such bans have a severe disparate impact on African Americans and Latinos, and any \nlegitimate safety concerns can be satisfied through the less discriminatory alternative of giving \nindividualized consideration to each potential resident’s circumstances and desirability as a \ntenant. \n73.  Moreover, the disparate impact of a facially neutral housing practice may be so \nstark and foreseeable that it demonstrates an unlawful intent to discriminate.  That is also the \ncase here.  Because of well-known racial disparities regarding people with criminal records, \nDefendants’ blanket ban operates to disqualify otherwise qualified African Americans and \nLatinos from living at The Sand Castle at a rate at least three to four and one-half times the rate \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 22 of 44 PageID #: 303\n \nat which whites are disqualified.  By implementing and maintaining their blanket ban at The \nSand Castle, Defendants have been and continue to be engaged in intentional discrimination.  \nDefendants’ ban is consistent with a policy of limiting the number of new minority tenants in the \nbuilding.  \n74.  Defendants have also made concerted efforts to change The Sand Castle’s image \nand to present it as more “upscale,” including through its print and online advertising, which \nprominently feature young, white men and women.  These efforts are consistent with a policy of \npurposefully attracting white tenants and dissuading others from applying.   \nA.  Blanket Bans in General Disproportionately and Severely Impact African \nAmericans and Latinos at the National, State, and City Levels \n \n75.  Seven-hundred thousand inmates are released from confinement each year and \nbecome new targets of blanket bans.7  They are disproportionately African-American and Latino \nbecause the inmate population as a whole is disproportionately African-American and Latino, \nand 95% of inmates are eventually released.8 \n76.  In New York State, more than 50% of the 25,060 inmates released in 2009 were \nAfrican-American and over 25% were Latino.9  Yet the State’s general population is only 15.9% \nAfrican-American and 17.6% Latino.  Of the nearly 600,000 inmates released by the New York \n                                                 \n7 Ann E. Carson, and William J.

Most of those released from New York State prisons – nearly two-thirds since \n1985 – go to New York City to live.11  In 2011, New York City’s own Department of Correction \nreleased 88,000 people from its disproportionately African-American and Latino inmate \npopulation.12  The reentering population in New York City is therefore very large as well as \ndisproportionately minority. \n78.  Unlike African Americans and Latinos, whites are incarcerated, and therefore \nreleased from jails and prisons, at rates significantly lower than their representation in the \ngeneral population at the national, New York State, and New York City levels. \n79.  In addition to the large number of prisoners already being released, more than \n46,000 additional federal prisoners are expected to become eligible for early release over the \nnext several years.  In April 2014, the United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously \nto retroactively apply lower sentencing ranges for certain drug offenses.  This will permit \nprisoners currently serving under these offenses to apply for early release.  Approximately 75% \nof the prisoners eligible to apply are African-American or Latino.13 \n                                                 \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 New York City Dept. of Correction, 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2012, Oct.-Dec.

The sheer number of people released from prison every year has skyrocketed \nlargely because the incarcerated population in the United States has grown from 300,000 in 1980 \nto more than 2.3 million today.  Approximately 10 million misdemeanor cases are filed every \nyear.14  An additional 12 million people across the country have at least one felony conviction.15  \nAt the same time, it has become much easier and common for housing providers to identify and \nban people with criminal records because of the growth of companies that provide inexpensive \nbackground checks via the Internet. \n81.  The dramatic increase in the number of incarcerated people over these years is \ndue largely to the widespread policy of pursuing non-violent drug offenders.  Non-violent drug \noffenses alone account for two-thirds of the rise in the federal inmate population and more than \nhalf of the rise in state prisoners between 1985 and 2000.   \n82.  The national prison population is now comprised overwhelmingly of individuals \nconvicted of non-violent crimes.  As of 2010, less than 10% of the federal prison population had \nbeen convicted of a violent crime.16 \n83.  The massive increase in incarceration and in the number of people with criminal \nconvictions has hit African Americans and Latinos especially hard.

Men overwhelmingly comprise the nation’s inmate population and the disparities \nby race are especially stark among the male population.  African Americans represent 13% of the \nUnited States male population but over 40% of the more than two million men currently \nincarcerated.  Based on national incarceration data, the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that \n1 in 3 African-American men will go to prison at some point in their lifetime.  For Latino men, \nthe rate of expected incarceration is 1 in 6.  For white men, the figure is only 1 in 17.19  That is, \nAfrican-American men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men, and Latino \nmen are almost three times more likely to be incarcerated than white men.20   \n85.  The above-referenced disparities persist across categories of crime, such as drug \npossession. \n86.  New York State and New York City race and incarceration statistics mirror the \nnational data.

Of the 12,386 City inmates in custody on December 31, 2012, 57% were African-\nAmerican and 33% were Latino.22  The City’s general population, however, is only 25.5% \nAfrican-American and 28.6% Latino. \n88.  Much of the disparity in New York is due to the fact that African Americans are \nsignificantly more likely than whites to be arrested for drug-possession. 23  For example, African \nAmericans are four times as likely as whites to be arrested for marijuana possession despite \nresearch showing equivalent marijuana use; such arrests increased substantially in recent years in \nNew York City due to stop and frisk police tactics. \n89.  The bottom line is clear: more people have criminal records than ever before, and \nthose people are disproportionately African-American and Latino.  In New York City, New York \nState, and the country as a whole, African Americans and Latinos are far more likely than whites \nto have a criminal record. \n90.  This means both that African Americans and Latinos are much likelier than \nwhites to be barred from housing by automatic exclusions of people with records and that the \nabsolute number of African Americans and Latinos affected is very large.   \n                                                 \n21 State of New York Dept. of Correction and Comm.

The EEOC’s analysis of the impact of blanket bans in the employment context \nfurther confirms the disparate impact described here.  The EEOC has concluded from analyzing \nnational criminal records data that blanket bans have a disparate impact on the basis of race, and \nsets forth such a presumption in its Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and \nConviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(“Enforcement Guidance”).24 \n92.  The EEOC’s conclusion applies to the disparate impact analysis here because \nblanket bans operate the same way in housing as they do in employment.  In both contexts, \napplicants are uniformly and permanently excluded, whether from housing opportunities or \nemployment.  They are excluded based solely on the fact of a prior conviction, regardless of \nwhether they pose a current risk. \nB.  Defendants’ Blanket Ban at The Sand Castle Disproportionately and \nSeverely Impacts African Americans and Latinos in New York City \n \n93.  Just like blanket bans generally, Defendants’ specific blanket ban at The Sand \nCastle has a clear disparate impact on the basis of race.  In fact, the disparate impact is even \ngreater than a blanket ban would have at a national or statewide level because at the local level \n(i.e., New York City) incarceration rates for whites and minorities are even more \ndisproportionate.  Upon information and belief, The Sand Castle attracts potential tenants from \nall over New York City.  \n94.  In addition to prohibiting residents with criminal records, The Sand Castle \npurports to require that potential tenants earn a minimum of $30,000 per year.  But a stark \ndisparate impact persists even when this purported requirement is taken into account. \n                                                 \n24 See supra note 3.  The prior version from 1990 reached the same conclusion and set forth the same presumption. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 28 of 44 PageID #: 309\n \n95.  Using data from the United States Census Bureau, Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nand Bureau of Labor Statistics, the likely racial composition of City residents who have criminal \nrecords and annual incomes near or above $30,000 can be and has been ascertained through an \nindependent analysis. \n96.  The analysis shows that 12.2% of African-American men who live in New York \nCity, and 18% of Latino men who live in the City, satisfy The Sand Castle’s income threshold \nbut are nonetheless disqualified from living at The Sand Castle because of Defendants’ blanket \nban.   \n97.  The analysis further shows that only 4.1% of white men who live in the City \nsatisfy the income threshold but are disqualified by the blanket ban. \n98.  This means that otherwise qualified African-American men are three times as \nlikely as white men to be disqualified by Defendants’ blanket ban, and that Latino men are \nnearly four and one-half times as likely to be disqualified. \n99.  These figures, if anything, understate the disparities.  Alternative statistical \nmodels indicate that the disparate impact caused by Defendants’ blanket ban may be \nsignificantly greater. \n100.  Defendants also purport to require potential tenants to have a credit score above \n600.  Because African-American and Latino City residents with incomes near or above $30,000 \nalso typically have FICO scores over 600, credit score is not independently important for this \nanalysis.25 \n101.  The racially disparate impact on African Americans and Latinos of Defendants’ \nblanket refusal to provide housing to people with criminal records is clear from these findings. \n                                                 \n25 Benjamin Levinger, Marques Benton, Stephan Meier, The Cost of Not Knowing the Score: Self-Estimated Credit \nScores and Financial Outcomes, 32 J. Fam. Econ. 566, 569 (2011).   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 29 of 44 PageID #: 310\n \n102.  Moreover, even if Defendants’ actions were viewed more narrowly as applying a \nblanket ban only against Fortune and its clients – notwithstanding Defendants’ explicit statement \nthat the policy applies to everyone – that would still clearly have a racially disparate impact.  \nBecause Fortune’s clients are over 95% African-American and Latino and any income and credit \nscore requirements are irrelevant since Fortune would be the actual renter, the disparate impact \nwould be even greater than on the general population. \nC.  Giving Individualized Consideration to Applicants’ Circumstances Is a Less \nDiscriminatory Alternative That Would Satisfy Any Concern About Safety \nat The Sand Castle \n \n103.  Defendants’ blanket ban is not necessary to achieve a legitimate \nnondiscriminatory business purpose.  While public safety may be Defendants’ rationale for \nautomatically excluding Fortune’s clients and all others with criminal records from housing, \nblanket bans are not necessary to satisfy that concern.  Giving individualized consideration to \neach potential Sand Castle resident’s circumstances is a less discriminatory alternative to \nDefendants’ blanket ban and would serve public safety equally well. \n104.  Specifically, public safety at The Sand Castle can be protected through the use of \nindividual assessments that consider the nature of an individual’s conviction, the amount of time \nsince the conviction or release, and evidence of rehabilitation, among other factors.  An \nindividualized assessment allows people who have a criminal record, but who pose no realistic \ncurrent or future threat to the community, to obtain housing.  This more targeted and narrower \napproach both protects public safety and is less discriminatory and exclusionary because it \nreduces the number of minority applicants who are banned from The Sand Castle. \n105.  In the analogous employment context, the EEOC recognizes that individualized \nassessments are almost always required by law because they provide a less discriminatory \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 30 of 44 PageID #: 311\n \nalternative to blanket bans and are sufficient to protect legitimate interests like safety.  The \nagency’s Enforcement Guidance advocates the use of  “a targeted screen considering at least the \nnature of the crime, the time elapsed, and the nature of the job,” “notice to the individual that he \nhas been screened out because of a criminal conviction; an opportunity for the individual to \ndemonstrate that the exclusion should not be applied due to his particular circumstances; and \nconsideration by the employer as to whether the additional information provided by the \nindividual warrants an exception to the exclusion and shows that the policy as applied is not job \nrelated and consistent with business necessity.”26 \n106.  The EEOC’s sound rationale applies equally to housing, including housing at The \nSand Castle.   \n107.  A federal court of appeals has also recognized that blanket bans violate anti-\ndiscrimination laws (specifically, in the context of employment) because their disparate impact \ncannot be justified by a business necessity such as safety.  See Green v. Missouri Pacific \nRailroad, 523 F.2d 1290, 1293 (8th Cir. 1975).  Green held that a company policy automatically \nrejecting all applicants with a conviction for an offense other than a minor traffic infraction \ncaused a disparate impact based on race and could not be justified by business necessity.  The \nEighth Circuit noted that it “could not conceive of any business necessity that would \nautomatically place every individual convicted of any offense, except a minor traffic offense, in \nthe permanent ranks of the unemployed.”  Id. at 1298.   \n108.  Recent correspondence from HUD suggests it agrees that blanket bans in housing \nare not necessary to achieve a legitimate interest and constitute unlawful discrimination on the \nbasis of race.   \n                                                 \n26 See supra note 3.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 31 of 44 PageID #: 312\n \n109.  In a 2011 letter to public housing authorities across the country, the HUD \nSecretary and the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing emphasized the importance \nof “helping ex-offenders gain access to one of the most fundamental building blocks of a stable \nlife—a place to live.”  The letter makes clear that beyond the very limited, categorical exclusion \nof individuals who were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine on the premises of \nfederally assisted housing and sex offenders who are subject to a lifetime registration \nrequirement, public housing authorities enjoy “broad discretion” to “consider all relevant \ninformation, including factors which indicate a reasonable probability of favorable future \nconduct.”  Further, the letter provides that public housing authorities “should take into \nconsideration,” for example, evidence of rehabilitation and participation in counseling programs. \n110.  In making 46,000 drug offenders eligible to apply for early release from prison, \nthe United States Sentencing Commission unanimously concluded that individual assessments of \neach prisoner will suffice to protect public safety.  Specifically, judges will consider a range of \nfactors when evaluating each early-release application, including the nature and circumstances of \nthe offense, the offender’s characteristics, deterrence, and the offender’s potential threat to \nsociety.27  The Commission emphasized that this “measured approach” will “protect public \nsafety by enabling appropriate consideration of individual petitions by judges.”28  The \nCommission thus has endorsed individualized assessments, rather than blanket judgments about \nthose with criminal records, as sufficient for the protection of public safety. \n                                                 \n27 U.S. Sentencing Comm., Frequently Asked Questions: Retroactive Application of the 2014 Drug Guidelines \nAmendment 2, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/materials-on-2014-drug-guidelines-\namendment/20140724_FAQ.pdf. \n \n28 U.S. Sentencing Comm., News Release: United States Sentencing Commission, U.S. Sentencing Commission \nUnanimously Votes to Allow Delayed Retroactive Reduction in Drug Trafficking Sentences (July 18, 2014), \nhttp://www.ussc.gov/news/press-releases-and-news-advisories/press-releases-and-news-advisories-archives. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 32 of 44 PageID #: 313\n \n111.  That several Fortune clients have lived at The Sand Castle successfully and \nwithout incident further undermines any suggestion that Defendants’ policy is necessary to serve \npublic safety.  Yet those clients would have been excluded from living at The Sand Castle had \nFortune tried to lease units for them in or after the summer of 2013 when Defendants were aware \nthat Fortune’s clients have criminal histories. \n112.  Indeed, under Defendants’ current policy, even formerly incarcerated individuals \nwith exemplary post-incarceration achievements are excluded.  For example, former Fortune \nclient Stanley Richards, released from prison more than 20 years ago, is Fortune’s Senior Vice \nPresident.  Hired as a counselor at Fortune in 1991, Mr. Richards steadily worked his way up, \nbecoming manager of career development and deputy executive director.  He currently oversees \nall of Fortune’s housing programs and has developed a wide range of skills and experience in \nimplementing supportive reentry programs for people released from prison.  Mr. Richards’ work \nand achievements have been recognized by the White House and the Department of Labor.  \nAnother former Fortune client, The Honorable Walter Strauss, became a Manhattan Housing \nCourt judge after serving two prison sentences for non-violent crimes.  Prior to taking the bench, \nJudge Strauss obtained his GED through a prison education program, attended the City \nUniversity of New York at night for his bachelor’s degree, and attended Rutgers University Law \nSchool.  Both Mr. Richards and Judge Strauss are examples of individuals who changed their \nlives for the better after incarceration, establishing careers and collecting professional accolades.  \nLike many other Fortune clients who have led successful, crime-free lives post incarceration, \nneither pose any threat whatsoever to public safety.  Even so, neither Mr. Richards nor Judge \nStrauss would be welcome at The Sand Castle.    \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 33 of 44 PageID #: 314\n \n113.  It would not compromise any legitimate concern Defendants may have to give \nindividualized consideration to Fortune’s clients’ particular circumstances and allow those who \ndo not threaten public safety to live at The Sand Castle.  Defendants’ blanket criminal record ban \nat The Sand Castle nonetheless prevents any individualized consideration.  Defendants’ policy of \nautomatically excluding people with criminal records, including people like Fortune’s clients \nwho are successfully and commendably reintegrating into society, is not necessary to achieve a \nlegitimate business purpose.   \n114.  Because Defendants’ blanket ban has a large discriminatory impact on the basis of \nrace and is not necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose, it is unlawfully \ndiscriminatory. \n115.  Had Defendants enforced any lawful and appropriate nondiscriminatory policy \nregarding the consideration of criminal records, including performing in good faith an \nindividualized assessment, they would have had no valid basis to deny housing at The Sand \nCastle to most of Fortune’s clients.  Moreover, if Defendants implement a lawful policy, they \nwill have no valid basis to deny housing at The Sand Castle to most of Fortune’s clients in the \nfuture. \n116.  The discriminatory disparate impact of Defendants’ blanket ban is so large and \nforeseeable – and its overbreadth so unnecessary – that Defendants’ intent to discriminate against \nAfrican Americans and Latinos can be inferred.  Fortune contends that Defendants fully \nunderstand the unnecessary disparate impact that the blanket ban has on African-American and \nLatino applicants as well as the effect that such a policy has on the racial make-up of The Sand \nCastle.  Defendants nonetheless intentionally implemented and continue to pursue that policy for \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 34 of 44 PageID #: 315\n \nthe express purpose of decreasing or at least limiting the number of persons of color at the \nproperty.     \nIII.  DEFENDANTS’ BLANKET BAN AND OTHERS LIKE IT PREVENT \nFORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FROM OBTAINING \nCRITICALLY IMPORTANT SAFE AND STABLE HOUSING \n \n117.  The harm inflicted by discriminatory blanket bans is great not only in terms of the \nsheer number of people affected, as shown above, but also in terms of the devastating \nconsequences for each affected individual trying to reenter society.  Preventing this harm, or at \nthe very least minimizing it, is central to Fortune’s mission. \n118.  Individuals reentering society after time in prison confront an array of challenges.  \nThese include finding employment, securing government benefits, and reestablishing community \nties.  But their most immediate need is to secure safe and affordable housing.  Especially in a \nplace like New York City, where housing is extremely expensive, that is very difficult. \n119.  Research shows that success in finding adequate housing, though difficult, is \ncritically important to meeting the other challenges faced by reentrants.  Housing has been \ncharacterized, properly, as the “lynchpin that holds the reintegration process together.”29   \n120.  A 2004 New York City study demonstrated that more than 30% of single adults \nentering shelters under the Department of Homeless Services have recently been released from \ncity and state correctional institutions.  Without stable housing, many continually cycle between \nincarceration and shelters.30  \n                                                 \n29 See supra note 5.   \n \n30 NYC Department of Homeless Services, Summary of DOC/DHS Data Match (Jan. 22, 2004) (draft analysis \nsubmitted for review as part of the New York City Dept. of Correction and Dept. of Homeless Services Discharge \nPlanning Initiative). \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 35 of 44 PageID #: 316\n \n121.  Other research has shown that reentrants who do not find stable housing in the \ncommunity are more likely to recidivate than those who are able to secure permanent housing.       \n122.  An Urban Institute study likewise found a causal connection between the inability \nto find permanent housing and recidivism.  According to the study, reentrants often did not \nsucceed in the community if they could not find a safe and stable place to live.31 \n123.  The Vera Institute of Justice found that parolees released from incarceration who \nentered New York City homeless shelters were seven times more likely to abscond from post-\nrelease supervision than those with more stable housing.  It also found that reentrants in \ntemporary shelter housing had more difficulty resisting drugs and finding work.32   \n124.  This and other evidence makes plain that adequate housing is crucial to success in \nthe reintegration process.  Yet blanket bans directly prevent reentrants from obtaining such \nhousing.  By design, blanket bans do so thoughtlessly, without giving any consideration to the \nparticular circumstances of a person trying to find a place to live.  This complete disregard for \nindividual circumstances cannot be justified under the law, and needlessly inflicts great harm on \nthe formerly incarcerated, their communities, and organizations like Fortune seeking to help \nthem become productive members of society. \nINJURY TO THE FORTUNE SOCIETY \n125.  Fortune has been directly and substantially harmed by the blanket ban against \nproviding housing to formerly incarcerated individuals and others with criminal records that \nDefendants have maintained since at least the summer of 2013.  Defendants’ policy has \ndiminished Fortune’s ability to perform its work, forced it to divert resources, and frustrated its \n                                                 \n31 Jeremy Travis and Caterina G. Roman, Urban Inst., Taking Stock: Housing, Homelessness, and Prisoner Reentry  \n7-10 (2004), http://www.urban.org/publications/411096.html.  \n \n32 Id. at 8.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 36 of 44 PageID #: 317\n \nmission of ensuring that formerly incarcerated people can successfully reenter society and obtain \nsafe and stable housing.  \n126.  Defendants’ policy placed Fortune at significant risk of losing grant funding and \ncaused unnecessary costs and delay related to the grant process.  As described in paragraph 54 \nabove, Fortune received a grant from the State of New York to obtain 25 rental units in Queens \nfor reentrants.  Defendants’ denial of housing delayed Fortune’s ability to meet the terms of the \ngrant and thereby put Fortune at risk of losing the grant altogether.  Ultimately, in order to fulfill \nits obligation, Fortune had to hire an additional staff member to search for and secure appropriate \nunits in other Queens apartment buildings.  After Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, it took \nFortune additional months to obtain the 25 units necessary to satisfy the grant’s terms.   \n127.  Further, Fortune devoted substantial time and other resources to identify The Sand \nCastle as appropriate housing for its clients.  Defendants’ discriminatory criminal records policy, \nhowever, prevented Fortune from placing clients there.  As a result, Fortune has been forced to \nexpend scarce and substantial additional resources to find adequate alternative housing options \nfor clients who otherwise would have been placed at The Sand Castle.  In addition to additional \nstaff time, Fortune has spent a significant amount of money in broker fees because it has had to \nemploy brokers and agents to assist it with finding housing for its clients in Queens.   \n128.  Defendants’ actions also impeded Fortune’s programs in another way.  When \nFortune is able to place multiple clients in one geographic area, it reduces travel time and costs \nfor Fortune’s caseworkers.  This is because rather than spending time traveling to several \ndifferent buildings in different neighborhoods for just a few meetings, in the same time period, a \ncaseworker can visit with multiple clients living at the same site.  Defendants’ refusal to allow \nFortune clients as tenants, and Fortune’s corresponding need to place clients at multiple sites \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 37 of 44 PageID #: 318\n \nspread throughout Queens, has increased both the temporal and financial cost of individual \ncaseworker visits.    \n129.  Defendants’ discriminatory conduct has also directly impeded Fortune’s ability to \noperate its housing programs and frustrated its mission by disrupting its housing pipeline.  As \ndescribed above, many of Fortune’s clients progress from temporary to phased-permanent to \npermanent housing.  By impeding Fortune’s ability to place its clients at The Sand Castle, \nDefendants have reduced the effectiveness of this model.  Specifically, Defendants’ \ndiscriminatory refusal caused Fortune clients otherwise eligible to live in The Sand Castle to \nremain in the Fortune Academy’s temporary housing.  Because these clients remained at the \nAcademy, fewer beds were available to other individuals newly released from prison and in need \nof immediate assistance.  But for Defendants’ discriminatory actions, Fortune staff would have \nbeen able to devote more time to locating housing for clients currently in its emergency and \nphased-permanent housing and Fortune would have been able to meet the needs of more clients. \n130.  Moreover, as a direct result of Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, Fortune has \nhad to divert resources to engage in advocacy, community education, and outreach about the \nneed to increase the availability of housing for formerly incarcerated individuals.  Fortune has \nbeen forced to allocate limited staff time and resources to both investigate and counteract \nDefendants’ discriminatory conduct.  As a result, Fortune has had to forgo other programmatic \nactivities it would have engaged in. \n131.  Unless enjoined, Defendants will continue to engage in the unlawful practices \ndescribed herein and the extent of Fortune’s injuries will increase. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 38 of 44 PageID #: 319\n \n132.

Defendants’ acts, policies, and practices have an adverse and disproportionate \nimpact on African Americans and Latinos in New York City as compared to similarly situated \nwhites.  This adverse and disproportionate impact is the direct result of Defendants’ blanket \npolicy of automatically refusing housing to all people with criminal records with no \nconsideration of their individual characteristics and circumstances.  This policy is not necessary \nto serve any substantial legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest, and any such interest can be \nsatisfied by another practice – providing individualized consideration – that would have a less \ndiscriminatory effect.  \n136.  Defendants’ acts, policies, and practices have been carried out with the intention \nof discriminating on the basis of race and color.  Defendants have adopted and maintained an \nexclusionary policy regarding the use of criminal records with the intent and expectation that the \npolicy disproportionately prevents African Americans and Latinos from obtaining housing at The \nSand Castle. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 30   Filed 05/01/15   Page 39 of 44 PageID #: 320\n \n137.

Scanlon, United States Magistrate Judge: \nPlaintiff The Fortune Society (“Plaintiff” or “Fortune”) brings this action against \nSandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp., Sarasota Gold, LLC, E & M Associates, \nLLC and Weissman Realty Group, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”) for injunctive, monetary \nand declarative relief.  Am. Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 30.  Plaintiff alleges that, in violation of the \nFair Housing Act, Defendants’ housing policy has the purpose or effect of discriminating against \nAfrican-American and Latino persons, including Fortune’s clients.  Id.  Before the Court is \nPlaintiff’s partial motion for summary judgment,1 ECF No. 94, and Defendants’ motion for \nsummary judgment, ECF No. 97, both brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n(“Rule”) 56.  Defendants also move to dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12.  ECF \nNo. 115.  Each side moves to exclude the other side’s expert testimony.

Plaintiff also does not move for summary judgment with respect to its disparate \ntreatment claim. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 2 of 49 PageID #: 8772\n97-1 at 7-18; 98 at 35-38.2  For the reasons stated herein, the Court:  (i) denies Plaintiff’s partial \nmotion for summary judgment; (ii) denies in part and grants in part Defendants’ cross motion for \nsummary judgment; (iii) denies Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing; (iv) denies \nDefendants’ motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Allan McMillan Parnell; and (v) \ndenies as moot Plaintiff’s motion to exclude the expert testimony of Donald Welsch, with leave \nto renew in a pretrial motion. \nI.  BACKGROUND \na.  Procedural History \nPlaintiff commenced this action by filing a complaint alleging that Defendants have a \nhousing policy of automatically excluding any person with a record of a criminal conviction \nfrom renting or living3 in an apartment at the Sand Castle apartment complex in Queens, New \nYork (the “Sand Castle”), and that this policy has the purpose or effect of discriminating against \nAfrican-American and Latino persons, including Fortune’s clients, in violation of the Fair \nHousing Act (“FHA”) and New York State and City law.  Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 1.  Plaintiff \nalleges that the policy resulted in the denial of housing at the Sand Castle for twenty of Fortune’s \nclients and cost Plaintiff $65,000 in additional rent, as well as an unspecified additional amount \nin brokers’ fees.  ECF No. 116 at 7.  The Parties consented to this Court’s jurisdiction in \naccordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Rule 73.  ECF No. 26.  Plaintiff submitted an amended \ncomplaint, ECF No. 30, to add Defendant E & M Associates, LLC, and to add perfecting \n                                                 \n2 For ease of reference, all citations use ECF pagination.  \n3 The evidence discussed herein focuses on the primary tenants and leaseholders (or any \nindividual whose income is considered to meet the Sand Castle’s income requirements, Ex. 60, \nECF No. 94-15 at 6), but not on family or friends who may also reside in an apartment.  The only \nissue raised as to “living” in an apartment, as distinct from renting, is raised when a corporate \nentity rented or sought to rent an apartment on behalf of an individual.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 3 of 49 PageID #: 8773\ncitations, ECF No. 27.  Defendants filed an amended answer.  ECF No. 37.  The Parties \nsubsequently cross-moved for summary judgment, ECF Nos. 94, 97, which was followed by \nsupplemental motion practice relating to standing, ECF Nos. 115-17, 119, 122, 125, and \nsubmission of supplemental authority, ECF Nos. 126, 129. \nb.  Relevant Facts \nAfter reviewing both Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ Rule 56.1 statements and the responses \nthereto, together with the exhibits and submissions of both sides, the Court finds that the \nfollowing relevant facts are undisputed, unless otherwise indicated.   \ni.  The Sand Castle, Acquisition And Staffing \n The Sand Castle is a four-building apartment complex with 917 rental units located at 7-\n11 Seagirt Avenue in Far Rockaway, Queens.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 11, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. \nto Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 11, ECF No. 131.  In 2006, Defendant Sarasota Gold LLC (“Sarasota \nGold”), a New York corporation, acquired the Sand Castle buildings and has since held all \nequitable interest in the property.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 12, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 12, ECF No. 131.

Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 12, ECF No. 97-2; Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 12, ECF No. \n98-2.  Sarasota Gold, however, made renovations to the building, and, as apartments became \navailable, began to accept residents who paid their rent in whole or in part with governmental \nrent subsidies, such as Hurricane Sandy victims with FEMA funding.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 14-15, \nECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 14-15, ECF No. 131.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 4 of 49 PageID #: 8774\nShortly after acquiring the Sand Castle, Sarasota Gold entered an agreement with \nDefendant E & M Associates LLC (“E&M”) to serve as the Sand Castle’s management \ncompany, and E&M has since directed and controlled the complex’s staff.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. \n¶¶ 23-24, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 23-24, ECF No. 131.  E&M is \nowned by Mr. Langer, and Mr. Ginzberg is Senior Vice President (each is an owner of Sarasota \nGold).  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 25, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 25, ECF No. 131.  \nSince 2009, Defendant Weissman Realty Group, LLC (“Weissman”) provided brokerage \nservices for the Sand Castle, and two of Weissman’s employees, Melissa Gursky and Heidi \nHershkowitz, worked on-site (from 2009-2012 and 2013-present, respectively).  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. \n¶¶ 26-27, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 26-27, ECF No. 131.  These on-site \nemployees were under the direction and control of Sarasota Gold and E&M, and later Defendant \nSandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corporation (“Sandcastle Towers”).  Pl.’s 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 29, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 29, ECF No. 131.   \nThe Parties agree that Sarasota Gold’s and E&M’s senior leadership have minimal-to-no \ninvolvement in the day-to-day operations of the Sand Castle.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 30, ECF No. 94-\n2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 30, ECF No. 131.  Three members of E&M – Phil Goldstein, \nMeyer Brecher and Sruly Tress – helped manage the Sand Castle during the period relevant to \nthis litigation.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 36-37, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 36-\n37, ECF No. 131.  Mr. Tress has managed the Sand Castle since January 2014, is under the \ndirection and control of E&M, and is on-site once per-week.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 45-46, 48, ECF \nNo. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 45-46, 48, ECF No. 131.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 5 of 49 PageID #: 8775\nii.  The Regulatory Agreement \nIn 2013, Sarasota Gold entered into an agreement with the New York City Housing \nDevelopment Corporation to become a provider of affordable housing (the “Regulatory \nAgreement”).  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 16, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 16, ECF \nNo. 131.  The Regulatory Agreement requires that 90% of Sand Castle residents earn no more \nthan 125% of the Area Median Income and that 10% of residents earn no more than 135% of the \nArea Median Income.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 90, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 90, \nECF No. 131.  As applied by the Sand Castle staff, this typically means that applicants cannot \nearn more than $70,000 annually.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 91, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 91, ECF No. 131.  For the sole purpose of facilitating the Regulatory Agreement, the \nmembers of Sarasota Gold created Sandcastle Towers, with Mr. Ginzberg as president.

Racial Makeup Of The Sand Castle And Surrounding Areas \nThe Parties dispute the current relevant racial makeup of the Sand Castle and its \nsurrounding area.4  Defendants assert that based on the United States Census Bureau, 2010-2014 \nAmerican Community Survey, the area around the Sand Castle is approximately “50% Black.”  \nDefs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 13, ECF No. 97-2.  Relying on a tenant roster on which Defendants’ \nemployees Rose Campbell and Sonia Forrest assigned a race to each tenant based largely on their \nown personal assessment (the “Tenant Roster”), Defendants allege that 70% of the Sand Castle’s \ntenants are “Black” – significantly more than the 50% Defendants assign to the surrounding \narea.5  Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 14, ECF No. 97-2; Tenant Roster, Ex. E, ECF No. 97-8; Campbell \n                                                 \n4 The Parties also disagree as to what is the relevant area to be considered for FHA purposes.   \n5 The Tenant Roster lacks the requisite degree of trustworthiness essential to be considered as \nevidence.  See Romano v. Howarth, 998 F.2d 101, 108 (2d Cir. 1993) (excluding business \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 6 of 49 PageID #: 8776\nDecl., Ex. Y, ECF No. 97-29; Forrest Decl., Ex. Z, ECF No. 97-30.  Plaintiff controverts these \nnumbers by citing to the same Census Survey, which reports that the area surrounding the Sand \nCastle is 44.3% Black or African-American, 28.3% Hispanic or Latino and 22.1% White, while \nthe Census Block made up entirely of the Sand Castle is 37.4% Black or African-American, \n14.9% Hispanic or Latino and 42.6% White.  Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 13, ECF No. 98-\n2; Ex. D, ECF No. 97-7 at 1-2; Ex. 8, ECF No. 94-5 at 340-42, 347.  Neither side provided any \ninformation about the current or historical rate of tenant turnover in the Sand Castle, the Census \nBlock or the Census Survey.   \niv.  The Sand Castle Rental Application Process \nSince 2006, the year of acquisition, Sarasota Gold employees Ms. Silvera and Ms. \nCampbell have been primarily responsible for reviewing Sand Castle rental applications.  Pl.’s \n                                                 \nrecords that lacked “the requisite degree of trustworthiness essential to the business record \nexception”).  Defendants’ employees assigned a race to each tenant in part based on their best \nguesses regarding the race of each tenant.  Campbell Decl., Ex. Y, ECF No. 97-29; Forrest Decl., \nEx. Z, ECF No. 97-30.  They do not report that they had any input from the individuals whose \nrace they described in the annotated Tenant Roster.  The Tenant Roster, as well as any portion of \nexpert testimony based on the Tenant Roster, is inadmissible and will not be considered on these \nmotions.  See Romano, 998 F.2d at 108. \nOn this point, Defendants’ opposition does not directly respond to Plaintiff’s claim that the key \ndemographic is the potential pool of applicants, and not the actual accepted tenants.  The bottom-\nline number with respect to racial diversity is not a defense to allegations of disparate impact as \nto the applicant pool.  See Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 455 (1982) (“It is clear that \nCongress never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against some employees on \nthe basis of race or sex merely because he favorably treats other members of the employees’ \ngroup.”); Dist. Council 37, Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emp., AFL-CIO v. NYC Dep’t of \nParks & Recreation, 113 F.3d 347, 352 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that a “nondiscriminatory bottom \nline was no defense” to a Title VII disparate impact claim); Waisome v. Port Authority of NY & \nNJ, 948 F.2d 1370, 1378 (2d Cir. 1991) (“An employer may not rely on a bottom-line defense, \nby that we mean that though parts of the employer’s hiring or promotion procedures adversely \naffected members of a protected group, it may not successfully argue that a sufficient number of \nprotected group members were nevertheless hired or promoted so as to refute proof of disparate \nimpact.”); see also Quad Enters. Co. v. Town of Southold, 369 F.

Felony Convictions \nThe Parties also present contravening facts regarding whether Defendants applied a more \nlimited scope ban, rejecting applicants with felony convictions.  (The alleged felony ban is a \nrevision of Plaintiff’s original theory.) \nPlaintiff points to Ms. Campbell’s statement during her deposition that the landlord \ncriteria denied applicants with felony convictions.

The Sand Castle’s Rental Applicant Files \nDefendants did not regularly retain rejected rental applications, so comprehensive data on \nrejected applicants are not available.

Nonetheless, discovery revealed 1,277 applicant/tenant files, \nincluding 1,145 accepted applications, 116 rejected applications and 16 applications of unknown \nstatus.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 135, ECF No. 94-2; ECF No. 94-6 at 24-76.9  Plaintiff’s expert opined \n                                                 \n7 It is unclear whether Ms. Campbell believes robbery to be a misdemeanor or knows that it is a \nfelony.  See N.Y. Penal Law §§ 160.05-.15.   \n8 Although Defendants rely on Ms. Campbell’s testimony to rebut the assertion that Defendants’ \npolicy prohibited individuals with felony convictions, the testimony referenced addresses \nmisdemeanors.   \n9 Defendants object to the consideration of this data because it relies on a spreadsheet created by \nPlaintiff’s counsel based on files obtained from the Sand Castle.  The spreadsheet is attached to a \ndeclaration detailing how the document was compiled and from where each piece of information \noriginated.  Under Rule 1006, a party may use a summary or chart “to prove the content of \nvoluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 1006.  Given that Defendants were free to present their own analysis of the files \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 14 of 49 PageID #: 8784\nthat this incomplete data does not provide a reliable depiction of the rejected applicants as it is \nunclear how many applications are missing.  Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-\n10 at 7.  The Court considers this data with respect to rejected applications, but recognizes the \nweight it may be given may be limited based on its seeming lack of completeness.  It is also \nunclear on the present record how incomplete the accepted applicant files are as there are more \naccepted applications than apartments.  Without historical data about turnover or stability, it is \nnot evident how many accepted applications are missing from Defendants’ files.   \nOf the accepted application files that included a Weimark background check, two reflect \na felonious criminal history and eight indicate misdemeanor criminal histories.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. \n¶¶ 136, 143, ECF No. 94-2.  Of the eight misdemeanors, five were traffic offenses.  Id. ¶ 144.  Of \nthe three non-traffic offenses, one was part of an application file for someone who was \npotentially a tenant before initiation of this litigation in 2014.  Id.

Fortune’s Expenditures \nFollowing Fortune’s conversations with Defendants, Fortune asserts that its employees \nexpended substantial additional time and money to locate alternative housing for the Twenty \nClients.10  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 312, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 312, ECF No. \n131.

Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 312, \nECF No. 131.  As a preliminary matter, the affidavits are admissible evidence to the extent they \nprovide the affiant’s personal knowledge and set out facts that would be admissible in evidence.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).  The evidence submitted by Plaintiff on this issue is sufficient to survive \nsummary judgment.  It is for the fact-finder to determine what weight to give to the testimony of \nFortune’s employees regarding the time they allegedly expended in connection with Defendants’ \npolicy.  See Helena Assocs., LLC v. EFCO Corp., No. 06 Civ. 0861 (PKL), 2008 WL 2117621, \nat *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 15, 2008) (finding that the trier of fact is to determine the weight of lay \nwitness testimony, so long as the testimony is based on first-hand knowledge).  Moreover, \nPlaintiff provides additional evidence with respect to some of its expenditures, including the \nbrokers’ fees for subsequent housing placements of the Twenty Clients, Ex. 97, ECF No. 116-8, \nand documentation of salary and expenses for an employee hired by Fortune to find housing for \nthe Twenty Clients.  Ex. 98, ECF No. 116-9. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 18 of 49 PageID #: 8788\nmore than one year to find housing for the Twenty Clients who Fortune would otherwise have \nplaced at the Sand Castle.

Upon finding housing for the Twenty Clients, \nFortune asserts that it expended rent in excess of what would have been paid at the Sand Castle \nand incurred otherwise avoidable brokers’ fees.  Id.     \nII.  STANDING \nThe threshold question in every federal case, which determines the power of the court to \nentertain the suit, is “whether the plaintiff has made out a ‘case or controversy’ between himself \nand the defendant within the meaning of Art[icle] III.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 \n(1975).  “Standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or \ncontroversy.  The doctrine developed in our case law to ensure that federal courts do not exceed \ntheir authority as it has been traditionally understood.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, \n1547 (2016). \n“The Art[icle] III judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against \ninjury to the complaining party, even though the court’s judgment may benefit others \ncollaterally.”  Warth, 422 U.S. at 499.  Thus, a federal court’s jurisdiction can be invoked only \nwhen the plaintiff itself has suffered “some threatened or actual injury resulting from the \nputatively illegal action . . . .”  Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 (1973).  The \nSupreme Court has established that the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing \nconsists of three elements.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  “The \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 19 of 49 PageID #: 8789\nplaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  \nSpokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547.  The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the \nburden of establishing these elements and, on summary judgment, “must set forth by affidavit or \nother evidence specific facts which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken \nas true.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation marks & citation omitted).  \nAlthough the Supreme Court has also articulated “prudential” requirements for \nstanding,11 “‘Congress intended standing under . . . [the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et \nseq.] to extend to the full limits of Art[icle] III’ and . . . courts accordingly lack the authority to \ncreate prudential barriers to standing in suits brought under that section.”  Havens Realty Corp. \nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982) (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 \nU.S. 91, 103 n.9 (1979)); see Anderson Grp., LLC v. City of Saratoga Springs, 805 F.3d 34, 44 \n(2d Cir. 2015) (“Th[e] FHA definition of ‘aggrieved person’ extends as broadly as permitted by \nArticle III of the Constitution.  As such, there are no prudential barriers to plaintiff’s standing \nunder the FHA.”).  Thus, the only requirement for standing to sue under the FHA “is the \nArt[icle] III minima of injury in fact:  that the plaintiff allege that as a result of the defendant’s \nactions he has suffered ‘a distinct and palpable injury.’”  Havens, 455 U.S. at 372 (quoting \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 501).    \n                                                 \n11 Prudential requirements for standing include “the general prohibition on a litigant’s raising \nanother person’s legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more \nappropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.”  NYCLU v. NYC \nTransit Auth., 675 F. Supp. 2d 411, 424 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“NYCLU I”), aff’d, 652 F.3d 247 (2d \nCir. 2011), opinion amended & superseded, 684 F.3d 286 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation \nmarks & citation omitted). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 20 of 49 PageID #: 8790\na.  Organizational Vs. Associational Standing \n“[I]t is well established that the limitation on raising the rights of a third party does not \npreclude an organization from establishing standing.  Specifically, an organization may establish \nstanding in two ways” – by demonstrating a harm to the organization itself (“organizational \nstanding”) or to its members (“associational standing”).  NYCLU I, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 425 \n(citing Irish Lesbian & Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638, 649 (2d Cir. 1998)). \nOrganizational and associational standing are separate bases on which an organization \nmay assert standing, each having distinct requirements.  Although only organizational standing is \nasserted in this case, the Parties’ briefing demonstrates some confusion over the distinct \nrequirements.  Accordingly, the Court briefly addresses the differences between the two types of \nstanding.12 \nWith respect to organizational standing – at issue here – “an association may have \nstanding in its own right to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to vindicate whatever \n                                                 \n12 Defendants argue that to assert standing in a disparate impact case, the plaintiff must itself be \nan organization whose mission it is to represent members of a protected class.  Defendants have \nnot cited any authority supporting this proposition, and there is authority to the contrary.  For \nexample, in National Community Reinvestment Coalition v. Accredited Home Lenders Holding \nCo., 573 F. Supp. 2d 70, 73, 75 (D.D.C. 2008), a national nonprofit organization whose mission \nwas to “increase fair and equal access to credit, capital and banking services and products for all \nAmericans, regardless of race,” and whose members included community development \ncorporations, civil rights groups, community reinvestment advocates, local and state government \nagencies and churches, had standing to sue under the FHA for disparate impact.  See, e.g., \nLuxuryBeachfrontGetaway.com, Inc. v. Town of Riverhead, New York, No. 17 Civ. 4783 (SJF) \n(SIL), 2018 WL 4635736, at *5 (June 25, 2018) (finding a short-term rental business had \nstanding under the FHA where it alleged economic harm as a result of an ordinance that \nallegedly disparately impacted its ability to rent to families with children), R & R adopted in \nrelevant part, 2018 WL 3617947 (E.D.N.Y. July 27, 2018).  Further, Fortune is a not-for-profit \nwhose mission is to help formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society through, inter \nalia, housing placement services.  Page Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 20, ECF No. 94-7 at 10.  Although \nFortune’s mission is not specifically to help Black and/or Latino individuals find housing, \nbecause ninety percent of Fortune’s 350 clients are Black and/or Latino, the effect is \nsubstantially the same.  Id. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 21 of 49 PageID #: 8791\nrights and immunities the association itself may enjoy.”  Warth, 422 U.S. at 511.  Under the \n“organizational” standing rubric, the organization “must meet the same standing test that applies \nto individuals by showing actual or threatened injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged \nillegal action and likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.”  Irish Lesbian & Gay \nOrg., 143 F.3d at 649 (alterations, citations, & internal quotation marks omitted).  In an \norganizational standing case, the plaintiff need not identify the individuals allegedly injured by \nthe defendant’s actions because the organization itself is seeking to vindicate whatever rights and \nimmunities it may enjoy.  See NYCLU v. NYC Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 295 (2d Cir. 2012) \n(“NYCLU II”).  “Accordingly, the question becomes whether Plaintiff, as an organization, has \nmet its burden of demonstrating an ‘injury in fact–an invasion of a legally protected interest \nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.’”  NYCLU I, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 425 (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).   \n“[A]n organization may also assert ‘associational’ standing, that is, standing to bring suit \non behalf of its members.”  NYCLU I, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 425 (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple \nAdver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 342-43 (1977)).  To bring a claim by way of “associational” \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that:  “(a) [the organization’s] members would otherwise have \nstanding to sue in their own right; (b) the interests [the organization] seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires \nthe participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.  It is in the \ncontext of associational standing, as opposed to organizational standing, that an “argument that \nthe persons allegedly injured must be identified by name might have some validity . . . at the \nsummary judgment stage.”  Bldg. & Const. Trades Council of Buffalo, NY & Vicinity v. \nDowntown Dev., Inc., 448 F.3d 138, 144-45 (2d Cir. 2006).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 22 of 49 PageID #: 8792\nb.  Analysis13 \ni.  Plaintiff Has Alleged Injury Sufficient To Establish Standing To \nBring Its FHA Claims \n \n Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ alleged policy of prohibiting tenants with certain \ncriminal convictions has a disparate impact on racial minorities and caused Fortune, as an \norganization, concrete and particularized injury.  Under the FHA, the “only injury which need be \nshown to confer standing . . . is deflection of the [organization’s] time and money from \ncounseling to legal efforts directed against discrimination.”  Ragin v. Harry Macklowe Real \nEstate Co., 6 F.3d 898, 905 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that where “the Defendants’ advertising \npractices detracted the attention of [the housing organization’s] staff members from their regular \ntasks at the [organization],” the organization had standing to sue under the FHA because there \nneed only be a “perceptible impairment” of an organization’s activities and resources for there to \nbe an “injury in fact”); see Mhany Mgmt., Inc. v. Cty. of Nassau, 819 F.3d 581, 600 (2d Cir. \n2016) (“Standing under the [FHA] is as broad as Article III permits.”); Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d \n147, 157 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding that even “if only a few suspended drivers are counseled by [the \nplaintiff organization] in a year, there is some perceptible opportunity cost expended by the \n[organization], because the expenditure of resources that could be spent on other activities \n‘constitutes far more than simply a setback to [the organization’s] abstract social interests’” \n(quoting Havens, 455 U.S. at 379)).  “Such concrete and demonstrable injury to the \norganization’s activities – with the consequent drain on the organization’s resources – constitutes \n                                                 \n13 The Court’s analysis focuses on the federal law claims as the state and city laws are similar \nand at least as protective of prospective or potential applicants to the Sand Castle such that the \ndisparate impact claims will proceed to trial for the reasons discussed below.  Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s state and city disparate treatment claims is granted \nfor the reasons discussed in Section VI below.  See infra Section VI. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 23 of 49 PageID #: 8793\nfar more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.”  Havens, 455 U.S. \nat 379; see also Nat’l Cmty. Reinvestment Coal., 573 F. Supp. 2d at 75 (“[P]laintiff’s statement \n[that] they have expended resources on counteracting defendants’ policies are [sic] sufficient to \nstate an injury in fact caused by defendant’s conduct.”).   \nIn Havens, the Supreme Court found organizational standing to sue under the FHA \nexisted where an apartment owner’s racial steering practices impaired the organization’s ability \nto provide counseling and referral services for low-and-moderate-income home seekers, resulting \nin the organization suffering an injury in fact.  455 U.S. at 379.  “Furthermore, the Supreme \nCourt has stated that so long as the economic effect on an organization is real, the organization \ndoes not lose standing simply because the proximate cause of that economic injury is ‘the \norganization’s noneconomic interest in encouraging [a particular policy preference].’”  Nnebe, \n644 F.3d at 157 (alternations in original) (quoting Havens, 455 U.S. at 379 n.20).  Thus, an \nalleged drain on or diversion of an organization’s resources alone may suffice to constitute an \ninjury in fact.   \nPlaintiff alleges an economic loss and drain on its resources specifically resulting from its \ninability to place the Twenty Clients in the Sand Castle and creates an issue of material fact as to \nwhether it suffered a loss attributable to Defendants’ conduct.14  Specifically, Plaintiff \ndemonstrates that, in addition to its employee, Mr. Carter, expending substantial time trying to \nfind alternative housing for the Twenty Clients, Plaintiff hired a new employee, Joseph \n                                                 \n14 Of the Twenty Clients who Plaintiff claims were harmed by Defendants’ policy, five were \nidentified by first name:  Andrew, Sam, Wilfredo, Eric and Kevin.

Accordingly, Plaintiff has met this burden and adequately \ncreated an issue of material fact that it expended staff time and resources in finding alternative \nhousing for its otherwise qualified members who were deterred from submitting applications to \nthe Sand Castle housing complex because of Defendants’ alleged policy. \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that any of its members \n(including, as is relevant here, the Twenty Clients) met the Sand Castle’s other criteria relating to \ncredit score or landlord tenant litigation history is unavailing.  Defendants’ have “den[ied] the \n                                                 \n“expended staff time and other resources to investigate and respond to Defendants’ \ndiscriminatory rental practices, which diverted resources away from other [organization] \nactivities” sufficient to plead injury-in-fact).  Ms. Page also stated that she spent at least fifteen \nhours investigating Defendants’ alleged conduct prior to the litigation and assisting with the \nlitigation after it commenced.  Page Supp. Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 91, ECF No. 116-2; see also Page \nDecl. ¶ 12, Ex. 20, ECF No. 94-7 at 10.   \n16 Plaintiff is not required for the purposes of standing to show that its members would have \nultimately been selected as tenants.  See Winfield v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 5236 (LTS) \n(DCF), 2016 WL 6208564, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2016) (“Plaintiffs’ claimed injury relates to \ndenial of the opportunity to compete on an equal footing for fair housing in their desired \nneighborhoods, rather than from the failure to achieve a successful result.”); Huntington Branch, \nN.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Huntington, 689 F.2d 391, 394 (2d Cir. 1982) (stating that because of the \nuncertainties inherent in the housing market, housing discrimination plaintiffs have been \npermitted to proceed based on “a realistic opportunity to proceed with construction”).   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 26 of 49 PageID #: 8796\nSand Castle ‘enforces’ strict ‘cut-off[s]’ for applicant criteria, as evidence demonstrates all \ntenant applications are considered on a case-by-case basis.”  Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. \n¶¶ 148, 150, 161, 172, ECF No. 131; Defs.’ Jurisdictional Mot., ECF No. 115 at 17-18; see also \nEx. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at 294-96 (criteria regarding landlord-tenant history flexible), 346 (criteria \nregarding credit score flexible).  Rather, Defendants assert that the only criteria for which they \ndo not exercise discretion is an applicant’s maximum income and Plaintiff has adequately shown \nthat the Twenty Clients met the income requirements.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 91, ECF No. 94-2; \nDefs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 91 (income requirement under the Regulatory Agreement was \napproximately $70,000 per year or less), ECF No. 131; Carter Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 92, ECF No. 116-3 \n(each of the Twenty Clients earned less than $40,000 per year); see also Ex. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at \n256-57.   \nThere are material issues of fact as to Defendants’ defense that, under the Regulatory \nAgreement, the Sand Castle could not accept tenants with an organization.  First, there is a fact \nquestion as to whether the Regulatory Agreement prohibited contracting with organizations \n(provided the underlying tenant met the income requirements set forth under the Regulatory \nAgreement), as the Sand Castle was able to renew organizational contracts and, in fact, entered \ninto a new organizational contract while a party to the Regulatory Agreement.17  Second, \nPlaintiff has offered evidence that, if believed, shows that had the Sand Castle declined to enter \ninto a lease with Plaintiff due to its organizational status, Plaintiff could and would have had its \nclients sign leases in their own names, backed by Plaintiff’s financial support.  Carter Decl. ¶ 10, \n                                                 \n17 Defendants’ counsel Loretta Gastwirth submits a declaration asserting that this new \norganizational contract was entered into in error.  Gastwirth Reply Decl. ¶ 7, ECF 117-1.  Ms. \nGastwirth’s statement is the only evidence offered that the contract was entered into mistakenly.  \nWhether credible testimony can be offered on this issue is to be seen at trial and is a question for \nthe fact-finder, not the Court on summary judgment.     \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 27 of 49 PageID #: 8797\nEx. 92, ECF No. 116-3.  Plaintiff has adequately created a material issue of fact as to whether an \ninjury in fact was caused by Defendants’ alleged policy.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack \nof standing is denied.   \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nSummary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-movant, “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Kwong v. Bloomberg, 723 \nF.3d 160, 164-65 (2d Cir. 2013); Redd v. NY Div. of Parole, 678 F.3d 166, 174 (2d Cir. 2012).  \nThe role of the Court is not “to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to \ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Cioffi v. Averill Park Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. \nof Educ., 444 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 249 (1986)).  The “mere existence of a scintilla of evidence” is not enough to defeat \nsummary judgment; “there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the \n[non-moving party].”  Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.  The Court’s function is to decide \n“whether, after resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving \nparty, a rational juror could find in favor of that party. . . .”  Pinto v. Allstate Ins. Co., 221 F.3d \n394, 398 (2d Cir. 2000).   \nAfter examining the voluminous record, the Court finds that as to the merits, the Parties \nhave raised genuine issues of material fact as to:  (i) whether the Sand Castle had a ban on \napplicants with criminal histories, and, if so, what were the contours of that ban; and (ii) what \nweight should be given to Plaintiff’s expert testimony and whether that testimony proves that any \ncriminal record ban, as applied at the Sand Castle, disparately impacts a protected class.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 28 of 49 PageID #: 8798\nIV.  DAUBERT MOTIONS \nIn connection with Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Defendants moved to \npreclude the testimony and reports of Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Allan McMillan Parnell, Ph.D.  See \nECF No. 97.  In connection with Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiff \nmoved to preclude the testimony and reports of Defendants’ expert, Donald Welsch.  See ECF \nNo. 94.  For the reasons stated herein, Defendants’ motion to preclude the testimony of Dr. \nParnell is denied.  Given the Court’s decision on the summary judgment motions, which would \nbe the same with or without the testimony of Mr. Welsch, Plaintiff’s motion to preclude the \ntestimony of Mr. Welsch is moot but may be renewed without prejudice in pre-trial motions.  \na.  Legal Standards \n \nA “party seeking to introduce expert testimony ‘bears the burden of establishing its \nadmissibility by a preponderance of the evidence.’”  Qube Films Ltd. v. Padell, No. 13 Civ. 8405 \n(AJN), 2016 WL 888791, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2016) (quoting Baker v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., \n254 F. Supp. 2d 346, 353 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)).  Federal Rule of Evidence (“Evidence Rule”) 702 \nsets forth two prerequisites that must be satisfied before a witness is allowed to provide expert \ntestimony.  “First, the witness must be properly qualified as an expert to testify on scientific, \ntechnical, or specialized matters.”  Ramos v. SimplexGrinnell LP, 796 F. Supp. 2d 346, 372 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Stagl v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 117 F.3d 76, 81-82 (2d Cir. 1997)).  \n“Second, the court must determine whether the expert testimony is both relevant and reliable.”  \nId. (citing Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999)). \nIn Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993), the Supreme \nCourt held that the Federal Rules of Evidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that \nan expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.”  The \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 29 of 49 PageID #: 8799\nSupreme Court further explained, that the objective of the “gatekeeping” requirement of Daubert \nand Evidence Rule 702 is “to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon \nprofessional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of \nintellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.”  Kumho Tire, \n526 U.S. at 152.  “[T]he trial judge’s gatekeeping obligation applies not only to testimony based \non ‘scientific’ knowledge, as in Daubert, but also to testimony based on ‘technical’ or ‘other \nspecialized’ knowledge.”  Zaremba v. GMC, 360 F.3d 355, 358 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Kumho \nTire, 526 U.S. at 141).  The trial court ultimately has “broad discretion” in determining the \nadmissibility of expert testimony.  Brown v. Mermaid Plaza Assocs., LLC, No. 13 Civ. 760 \n(AMD) (CLP), 2016 WL 5802779, at *6 (July 20, 2016), R & R adopted, 2016 WL 5716414 \n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016).    \nIn order to assess whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable, the court engages in a \nflexible inquiry under which it may consider the following factors:  (i) whether a theory or \ntechnique can be or has been tested; (ii) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to \npeer review; (iii) the known or potential rate of error and the existence of standards controlling \nthe technique’s operation; and (iv) whether the theory or technique has gained general \nacceptance in the relevant scientific community.  See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94; see Zaremba, \n360 F.3d at 358.  “A district court should consider the Daubert factors ‘where they are reasonable \nmeasures of the reliability of expert testimony,’ [but] the list of factors ‘neither necessarily nor \nexclusively applies to all experts or in every case.’”  Zaremba, 360 F.3d at 358 (quoting Kumho \nTire, 526 U.S. at 141, 152); Qube Films, 2016 WL 888791, at *1 (explaining that the Daubert \nfactors “do not constitute a definitive checklist or test” (citing Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 150)).  \nIndeed, the trial court enjoys “the same kind of latitude in deciding how to test an expert’s \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 30 of 49 PageID #: 8800\nreliability . . . as it enjoys when it decides whether or not that expert’s relevant testimony is \nreliable.”  Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 152 (emphasis omitted). \nb.  Dr. Parnell \nIn order to prove its claim that the Sand Castle employs a policy that disparately impacts \nracial minorities, Plaintiff seeks to offer the testimony of demographer Dr. Parnell.  Dr. Parnell \nsubmitted an expert report summarizing his analysis and conclusions.  See Parnell Report, Ex. \n23, ECF No. 94-9.  Dr. Parnell later submitted a supplemental report in which he examined “the \ntenant information provided by the Defendants and . . . one of Sandcastle Apartment’s real estate \nbrokers” that was not available when Dr. Parnell prepared his initial report, and incorporated \nDefendants’ responses to Plaintiff’s first interrogatories into his analysis.  See Supplemental \nParnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 (together with the Parnell Report, the “Parnell Reports”) \nat 3-4.  In connection with Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Defendants move to \npreclude the expert testimony of Dr. Parnell.  See ECF No. 97.      \ni.  Qualifications  \n \nAttached to Dr. Parnell’s report is his curriculum vitae, which lists his qualifications to \nserve as an expert in this case.  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 17-24.  In addition, Dr. \nParnell testified regarding his qualifications at his deposition.  See, e.g., ECF No. 97-19 at 20-24, \n95-96.   \nDefendants do not challenge Dr. Parnell’s expertise in demography or housing \ndiscrimination generally.  To the extent Defendants suggest that Dr. Parnell lacks qualifications \nto provide expert testimony with respect to the New York City metropolitan area housing \nmarket, ECF No. 97-1 at 14, the Court disagrees.  A court may rely on expert testimony based on \ndemographic data without reference to the expert’s personal knowledge of the geographic area to \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 31 of 49 PageID #: 8801\nwhich the data relates.  See, e.g., Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc. v. Township of \nMount Holly, 658 F.3d 375, 382-83, 386-87 (3d Cir. 2011).        \nii.  Reliability/Relevance \n \n  The stated purpose of the Parnell Report is to “assess[] if a history of criminal conviction \ndisproportionately affects the ability of African-Americans and Latinos relative to Whites to \nqualify to rent at Sandcastle Apartment.”  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 4.  To \naccomplish this task, Dr. Parnell evaluates whether the “exclusion18 of those who have been \nincarcerated from the opportunity to rent at Sandcastle Apartments disproportionately affects \nAfrican Americans and Latinos relative to Whites in the New York City housing market.”  Id. at \n6.  He relies in part on the Report prepared by Dr. Christopher Wildeman regarding risks of \nconviction based on risks of incarceration for different races at different income levels.  Id.  Dr. \nParnell looks to three geographic areas in the Parnell Report – (i) Queens; (ii) New York City; \nand (iii) New York, N.Y. HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area (which includes Bronx County, \nKings County, Putnam County, Queens County, New York County, Richmond County, \nRockland County and Westchester County), the HUD-specified rental market for New York \n                                                 \n18 Defendants argue that Dr. Parnell’s “role, expertise, and analysis” radically changed between \nthe Parnell Reports and his declaration in support of those reports, including a change from \nreferencing a “blanket ban” on criminal background to a “screening out” of applicants with \ncriminal records.  Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 9, 14.  First, the Parnell Reports do not use the \nterm “blanket ban.”  See generally, Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9; Supplemental Parnell \nReport, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10.  Rather, Dr. Parnell describes his analysis as relating to the \n“exclusion” of individuals with criminal backgrounds.  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at \n6.  Dr. Parnell’s declaration describes the policy as “screening out” applicants with criminal \nrecords.  Parnell Decl., ECF No. 94-13 at 217.  Although the Court does not consider this change \nin language to require the rejection of Dr. Parnell’s testimony, Defendants may use it on cross-\nexamination before a fact-finder.  See R.F.M.A.S., Inc. v. So, 748 F. Supp. 2d 244, 252 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“Minor flaws in an expert’s analysis . . . can be probed through cross-\nexamination and generally go to the weight to be accorded to the expert’s testimony rather than \nadmissibility.”). \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 32 of 49 PageID #: 8802\nCity.  Id. at 6.  Dr. Parnell states in his supplemental report that he confirmed that these housing \nmarkets are the appropriate selection by looking at the zip codes for over 1,000 Sand Castle \napplicant files.19  Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 at 6, 8.  Dr. Parnell also \nfound that there were enough applicants from Nassau County to warrant consideration and added \nNassau County to the New York, N.Y. HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area as a fourth housing \nmarket for consideration.  Id. at 9.  He examines these areas with respect to four income levels:  \n(i) incomes of $30,000 or more; (ii) incomes of $40,000 or more; (iii) incomes between $30,000 \nand $70,000; and (iv) incomes between $40,000 and $70,000.  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. \n94-9 at 6.  Relying on Dr. Wildeman’s findings, which provided proportions of cumulative risk \nof incarceration for Whites, African-Americans and Latinos, Dr. Parnell used a “Z test” to assess \nwhether, within the above-referenced housing markets, the differences in incarceration rates \namong each racial group are statistically significant – in other words, whether the differences are \nmeaningful and not due to random chance.  Id. at 7-8.  The Z test calculation is based on the \nproportions of the two populations’ lifetime risk of incarceration – based on Dr. Wildeman’s \nfindings – and the size of the two populations in the relevant housing market – determined from \nthe 2009-2013 American Community Survey measures of household income, which was \ndesigned and collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Id. at 8.  Defendants do not challenge the use \nof the Z test.  Each of Dr. Parnell’s Z tests comparing Whites and African-Americans and Whites \nand Latinos in each selected housing market and each selected income range were statistically \n                                                 \n19 Mr. Welsch opines that “the partial zip code data was statistically insufficient to support the \nconclusion that the available data was sufficient to determine the applicant pool of prospective \nSandcastle tenants.”  Welsch Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. T, ECF No. 97-23.  Should the Court ultimately \nfind the Welsch Declaration admissible, this would be a question for the fact-finder.  The Court \ndoes not consider this assertion on the Parties’ motions for summary judgment, however, \nbecause it does not change the outcome of the motions.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 33 of 49 PageID #: 8803\nsignificant.  Id. at 12-15; Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 at 10, 16.   \n  The Court finds Dr. Parnell’s analysis sufficiently relevant, reliable and reasoned to be \nadmissible as evidence of a possible disparate impact.  Defendants’ primary challenges are that:  \n(i) Dr. Parnell does not address data specific to the Sand Castle, and, in fact, stated that the Sand \nCastle’s demographics were not relevant for a disparate impact analysis, Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. \n97-1 at 10, 12-13; (ii) Dr. Parnell used an improper applicant pool in his analysis – using market \nrent units without giving weight to income limitations posed by the Regulatory Agreement; \nincluding wealthy New York City neighborhoods in his applicant pool; and disregarding the fact \nthat the Sand Castle participates in Section 8 and other government programs providing rent \nsubsidies, id. at 14-15; and (iii) Dr. Parnell’s analysis is based on inadequate or unreliable data, \nid. at 8, 11, 15, 17.   These are questions regarding the weight that should be afforded Dr. \nParnell’s testimony, if any, rather than its admissibility.  For the reasons set forth below, none of \nthese arguments is sufficient to warrant preclusion of Dr. Parnell’s testimony.   \n  First, with respect to Dr. Parnell’s decision to look at a pool of potential applicants, rather \nthan data specific to the Sand Castle, the Court finds that this decision was reasoned and the \nresults relevant to this litigation.  The Second Circuit has recognized that statistics considering \nthe potential applicant pool, rather than the actual applicant pool are often appropriate where “the \nactual applicant pool might not reflect the potential applicant pool, due to a self-recognized \ninability on the part of potential applicants to meet the very standards challenged as being \ndiscriminatory.”  E.E.O.C. v. Joint Apprenticeship Comm. of the Joint Industry Bd. of the \nElectrical Indus., 164 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 1998).  Where, as here, a defendant is alleged to have \ninformed the potential applicant pool – here through advertising and external communications \nwith brokers and potential tenants – of the policy, an expert may properly account for potential \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 34 of 49 PageID #: 8804\napplicants that may have been discouraged from applying due to an awareness of the policy in \nquestion.  Id.; see Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 365 (1977) (“If an \nemployer should announce his policy of discrimination . . . his victims would not be limited to \nthe few who ignored the sign and subjected themselves to personal rebuffs.”); Malave v. Potter, \n320 F.3d 321, 327 n.4 (2d Cir. 2003) (finding that the application process might not adequately \nreflect the actual potential applicant pool); Anderson v. Douglas & Lomason Co., 26 F.3d 1277, \n1305 (5th Cir. 1994) (“[P]ractices which deter qualified minorities from applying for jobs \nimpermissibly taint[] any analysis which employs the use of actual applicant-flow data.”).  \nFurther, Dr. Parnell provides a plausible rationale for relying on the potential applicant pool \nrather than the actual applications, noting that the information available relating to actual \napplicants was inadequate to conduct a reliable statistical analysis because Defendants did not \nretain rejected rental applications.  Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 at 7.     \n  Second, Defendants’ argument that Dr. Parnell fails to give weight to income limitations \nof the Regulatory Agreement is incorrect.  Dr. Parnell analyzed data sets for a variety of income \nranges, including an income restriction of $70,000, which Defendants indicated was the \napproximate cap under the Regulatory Agreement.  See Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 91, ECF No. 94-2; \nDefs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 91, ECF No. 131.     \nThird, none of Dr. Parnell’s opinions proffered or methodology used falls “outside the \nrange where experts might reasonably differ . . . .”  Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 153.  Defendants’ \nargument that Dr. Parnell relies on “cherry picked” data provided by Plaintiff’s counsel \n(specifically, that Plaintiff did not provide Dr. Parnell with information regarding tenants with \ncriminal records) confuses Dr. Parnell’s role and suggests that he is opining on the existence of a \ncriminal record ban.  Although the language in the Parnell Reports could be clearer on this point, \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 35 of 49 PageID #: 8805\nthe tests Dr. Parnell conducted (which are unrelated to the determination of whether a ban exists) \nmake clear that his role is to assess the impact, not the existence, of such a ban if it exists.20  See \ngenerally, Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9.  Accordingly, whether he was aware of \ninformation that suggests there is or is not a criminal record ban does not bear on the reliability \nof his disparate impact analysis.21  Further, the Court will not preclude Dr. Parnell’s testimony \nbased on Defendants’ arguments that Dr. Parnell did not independently review the data \nunderlying the other expert report (by Dr. Wildeman) on which his reports relied, or because the \nunderlying report uses inferential data (including incarceration data rather than conviction data, \nand certain national data rather than New York City specific data).22  Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 97-1 \nat 8, 11, 15, 17.  It is entirely appropriate for an expert to base his or her assumptions on facts \nprovided by other experts.  See Verizon Directories Corp. v. Yellow Book USA, Inc., 331 F. \nSupp. 2d 134, 136 (E.D.N.Y. 2004).  Defendants’ concerns regarding the inferences drawn in \nPlaintiff’s experts’ reports go to the weight of Dr. Parnell’s analysis, not its admissibility.  See \n                                                 \n20 Defendants also argue that Dr. Parnell’s testimony should be excluded because Dr. Parnell \nmistakenly believed there was a ban excluding tenants with criminal convictions – both felonies \nand misdemeanors.  Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 10-11.  Experts may rely on factual \nassumptions as they prepare their reports.  See Lee Valley Tools, Ltd. v. Indus. Blade Co., 288 \nF.R.D. 254, 267 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (finding that an “expert opinion is not per se unreliable” even \nif it “relies upon some unverified or inaccurate information provided by the expert’s client”).  \nOne party’s belief that one of these assumptions is incorrect, when that assumption is a key \nundecided fact in the litigation, is not a basis to preclude expert testimony.  At trial, Defendants \nmay cross-examine Dr. Parnell in light of evidence that may undermine his assumption. \n21 To the extent Dr. Parnell seeks to opine on the existence of a criminal record ban at the Sand \nCastle, that factual testimony would likely be precluded as unrelated to Dr. Parnell’s expertise. \n22 Defendants do not expressly move to exclude Dr. Wildeman’s testimony, but, through their \nchallenge of Dr. Parnell discussed above, Defendants raise certain concerns about the data on \nwhich Dr. Wildeman relies – namely, his use of incarceration data as a proxy for conviction and \nhis use of national data.  To the extent Defendants intended to move to exclude Dr. Wildeman’s \ntestimony, such motion is denied for the same reasons Defendants’ challenges to Dr. Parnell’s \ntestimony are rejected.  Again, at trial, Defendants may cross-examine the experts as to those \nevidentiary assumptions.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 36 of 49 PageID #: 8806\nAnderson Grp., 805 F.3d at 50 (stating that contentions that an expert’s assumptions are \nunfounded go to weight, not admissibility); Danley v. Bayer (In re Mirena IUD Prods. Liab. \nLitig.), 169 F. Supp. 3d 396, 432 n.23 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (“Extrapolation from studies to support \nan expert’s conclusions . . . may at times go to the weight and not the admissibility of expert \ntestimony.”). \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to exclude Dr. Parnell’s testimony is \ndenied.  \nc.  Mr. Welsch \nDefendants seek to offer the testimony of Donald Welsch, a labor economist with forty \nyears’ experience in economic analysis and econometric and financial modeling.  Welsch Report, \nEx. 25, ECF No. 94-11 at 6.  Mr. Welsch submitted two reports – the first (the “Welsch Report”) \nand the second (the “Supplemental Welsch Report,” collectively the “Welsch Reports”) – and a \nsupporting declaration (the “Welsch Declaration”).  Decision on the admissibility of the Welsch \nReports and the Welsch Declaration is not necessary at this time as consideration of these reports \nwould not change the outcome of the Parties’ respective summary judgment motions.      \nThe Court notes that Plaintiff has raised serious concerns about the utility of the Welsch \nReports and their admissibility pursuant to Evidence Rule 702 and Daubert.  See Brown, 2016 \nWL 5802779, at *5 (“The standards governing the admissibility of expert testimony are set forth \nin Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and are further clarified in Daubert v. Merrell Dow \nPharmaceutical Inc. . . . .”).  The Welsch Reports provide conclusions with limited-to-no \nanalysis, and Mr. Welsch indicates that he did not look at the documents relied on by Plaintiff’s \nexperts despite opining on the reliability of Plaintiff’s experts’ analyses.  See Welsch Reports, \nExs. 25 & 26, ECF No. 94-11.  See Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Schneider, 379 F. Supp. 2d \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 37 of 49 PageID #: 8807\n461, 473 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“[A]n expert basing his opinion solely on experience must do \nmore than aver conclusorily that his experience led to his opinion . . . .”).  The Welsch \nDeclaration has greater indicia of reliability, but it is insufficient to sustain Defendants’ motion \nfor summary judgment and relies in part on at least one significant piece of inadmissible \nevidence (the Tenant Roster, see supra note 5).       \nV.  DISPARATE IMPACT ANALYSIS \n“A disparate impact analysis examines a facially-neutral policy or practice . . . for its \ndifferential impact or effect on a particular group.”  Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of \nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 933 (2d Cir. 1988).  Claims of disparate impact under the FHA are \nanalyzed “under a modified version of the burden-shifting analysis usually applied to \nemployment discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  Quad \nEnters., 369 F. App’x at 205-06; see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  \nIn order make out a prima facie case of disparate impact, Plaintiff must show:  “(1) the \noccurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant’s facially \nneutral acts or practices.”  Rivera v. Inc. Vill. of Farmingdale, 784 F. Supp. 2d 133, 142 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2011) (citations omitted).  Plaintiff “need not show [Defendants’] action was based on \nany discriminatory intent,” but Plaintiff must “prove that the [challenged] practice ‘actually or \npredictably results in . . . discrimination.’”  Id. at 142 (quoting Hack v. President & Fellows of \nYale Coll., 237 F.3d 81, 90 (2d Cir. 2000)).  Plaintiff must also “show a causal connection \nbetween the facially neutral policy and the alleged discriminatory effect.”  Id. (citations omitted).  \nIf Plaintiff successfully makes this showing, the burden shifts to Defendants to prove that the \npolicy furthered a legitimate, bona fide and nondiscriminatory interest.  Mhany Mgmt., 819 F.3d \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 38 of 49 PageID #: 8808\nat 617.  If Defendants meet their burden, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the \nlegitimate, bona fide and nondiscriminatory interest “supporting the challenged practice could be \nserved by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.”  Id. at 617-18.      \na.  There Is A Question Of Fact Whether Defendants Applied A Criminal \nRecord Ban \n \nThe Court finds that, at the outset, there is a threshold issue of fact as to whether \nDefendants applied a blanket ban against individuals with criminal convictions.  \nPlaintiff presents sufficient evidence that Defendants exclude tenants with criminal \nrecords to defeat Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on this issue.  Plaintiff provides \ntestimony regarding and transcripts of conversations between Fortune’s employees and \nDefendants’ employees in which Defendants’ employees indicated that the Sand Castle would \nnot rent to ex-offenders, and that a criminal record was a red flag.  See, e.g., Ex. 17, ECF No. 94-\n5 at 1706-07; Ex. 19, ECF No. 94-7 at 3-4; Ex. 58, ECF No. 94-14 at 11, 13.  Plaintiff also points \nto the Craigslist Email, the Craigslist Response Emails and other correspondence with brokers \nand real estate agents that state some variation of “no criminal record” as a tenant criterion.  See, \ne.g., Ex. 38, ECF No. 94-13 at 133-71; Ex. 47, ECF No. 94-13 at 205; Ex. 48, ECF No. 94-13 at \n209; Ex. 49, ECF No. 94-13 at 212; Ex. 50, ECF No. 94-13 at 214.  The testimony of some of \nDefendants’ agents further supports the assertion that such criteria exists.  See, e.g., Ex. 2, ECF \nNo. 94-4 at 319-20; Ex. 6, ECF No. 94-4 at 936-38; Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 114, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.’ \nResp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 114, ECF No. 131. \nOn the other hand, Defendants present sufficient evidence to avoid a finding as a matter \nof law that such a ban exists, or, if it does, to dispute the scope of that ban.  First, there are \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 39 of 49 PageID #: 8809\nmultiple tenants with criminal backgrounds currently living in the Sand Castle.23  Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 32, ECF No. 97-2; Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 32, ECF No. 98-2.  Second, prior to \nthis litigation, Fortune placed at least four of its clients at the Sand Castle without issue and \nwithout background checks.  Pl.’s Opp’n 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 295-297, ECF No. 98-1.  Although \nDefendants admit that background checks are standard, this deviation from that practice and \nadmission of four tenants with criminal history undercuts Plaintiff’s argument that a ban exists.  \nDefendants’ employees also testified that Defendants do not bar individuals with criminal history \nand instead conduct a case-by-case analysis.24  Ex. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at 260-63, 330; Ex. 10, ECF \nNo. 94-5 at 701.  \n                                                 \n23 Although Plaintiff discounts these individuals from its analysis by excluding individuals with \ntraffic offenses from its argument and stating that certain of these individuals were admitted in \nerror or admitted after this litigation began, even Plaintiff acknowledges that some number of \nindividuals remain after its exclusions.  Pl.’s Opp’n 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 113, 121-226, ECF No. 98-1.   \n24 Plaintiff offers stronger evidence of a felony ban than a ban encompassing felonies and \nmisdemeanors, but the Court finds there still remains a question of fact on this narrower issue.  \nDespite her testimony regarding the existence of a felony ban, Ms. Campbell also testified that \nshe would escalate an applicant’s file if the applicant had a record of robbery (a felony) for her \nmanager’s consideration.  Ex. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at 262-63, 319-20, 323, 328.  Her supervisor, Mr. \nTress testified that a felony conviction did not result in an applicant’s automatic rejection and \nthat the application would be reviewed case-by-case.  Ex. 10, ECF No. 94-5 at 698; see also id. \nat 701.  It is undisputed that there are Sand Castle tenants who have felony convictions.  Defs.’ \n56.1 Stmt. ¶ 32, ECF No. 97-2; Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 32, ECF No. 98-2.  Regardless, \nas discussed below in Section V(b), the Court does not find Plaintiff’s expert testimony \nconclusive enough to sustain a finding of a disparate impact on summary judgment – particularly \nwith respect to a more limited felony-only ban on which Plaintiff’s experts do not specifically \nopine.  See Wildeman Report, Ex. 27, ECF No. 94-12 at 4 (noting that disparities in conviction \nand incarceration are substantial across a range of offense types and “it is incredibly unlikely that \nremoving only a handful of specific offense types from the analysis, which is not possible with \nthe data at hand for a number of reasons, would change the conclusion of [the] report in any \nsubstantial way”); Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 7 (relying on Dr. Wildeman’s \ncumulative proportions).  Accordingly, the Court need not parse whether there is a more limited \nscope ban as that determination would not alter its conclusions with respect to summary \njudgment and the scope of any ban is a determination better left to the fact-finders.   \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 40 of 49 PageID #: 8810\nWith respect to the written statements and advertisements stating “no criminal \nbackground,” Ms. Campbell stated during her deposition that this language was merely a “broad \nprospective [sic]” and a way to avoid “get[ting] into the details as far as what kind of background \nis accepted or not.”  Ex. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at 340.  Mr. Tress stated during his deposition that the \nlanguage in the advertisement was a way of letting potential applicants know what information \nDefendants would be looking at and that “[t]heir criminal background shouldn’t be a bad \ncriminal background.”  Ex. 10, ECF No. 94-5 at 731.  Mr. Tress also stated in his deposition that \nthis language was not an accurate reflection of the Sand Castle’s requirements, noting that not all \ntenants met the credit score, landlord tenant or criminal background criteria set forth in the \ncommunications.  Ex. 10, ECF No. 94-5 at 710-11.  Notably, these same written communications \nalso state that an applicant must have a credit score of 600+ and no landlord tenant court record, \nEx. 38, ECF No. 94-13 at 133-71, but both sides agree that these “criteria” were flexible and not \nstrictly enforced.  Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 172, ECF No. 131; Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 159-\n78, ECF No. 94-2.     \nFor the foregoing reasons, a question of fact remains as to whether Defendants \nimplemented a criminal record ban and, if so, the scope of such ban.  Accordingly, summary \njudgment for Plaintiff is denied as Plaintiff cannot meet its burden without this initial showing \nthat a ban exists.   \nb.  There Is Conflicting Expert Testimony Regarding The Impact Of Any \nBlanket Ban \n \nIn addition to the material question of fact regarding whether Defendants implemented a \ncriminal record ban and, if so, the scope of that ban, there also remains a question of material \nfact regarding the impact of any such ban.  “The basis for a successful disparate impact claim \ninvolves a comparison between two groups–those affected and those unaffected by the facially \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 41 of 49 PageID #: 8811\nneutral policy.”  Rivera, 784 F. Supp. 2d at 142-43 (citations omitted).  “This comparison must \nreveal that although neutral, the policy in question imposes a ‘significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate impact’ on a protected group of individuals.”  Id. (citations omitted).  “Often[], \ndisproportionate impact is demonstrated through the use of statistics.”  Valdez v. Town of \nBrookhaven, No. 05 Civ. 4323 (JS), 2005 WL 3454708, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2005). \n   Plaintiff relies on the expert testimony of Dr. Parnell and Dr. Wildeman25 to provide a \nstatistical analysis establishing the alleged disparate impact of the alleged criminal record ban.26   \nDr. Wildeman estimates “the degree of racial disparity in the lifetime risk of being convicted of a \ncrime.”  Wildeman Report, Ex. 27, ECF No. 94-12 at 3.  In doing so, Dr. Wildeman relies on \ncertain inferences, including relying on incarceration data as a proxy for conviction data and \nusing national and state data rather than New York City-specific data.  Id. at 3, 13-14.  Dr. \nParnell relies on Dr. Wildeman’s findings based on national data to, as described in more detail \nin Section IV(b) above, assess the statistical significance of any impact a policy excluding \nindividuals with criminal backgrounds from the Sand Castle would have on individuals of \ndifferent races in specified housing markets.  See supra Section IV(b).  Dr. Parnell looks to the \n                                                 \n25 Defendants object to Plaintiff’s experts’ reports as hearsay because they are purportedly \nunsworn.  Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 179, 192, 219, 260, ECF No. 131.  This objection \nlacks merit as each of Plaintiff’s experts provided a sworn declaration in support of their reports \n(with the exception of Dr. Kazemian, whose report was sworn).  Ex. 21, ECF No. 94-7; Ex. 51, \nECF No. 94-13; Ex. 22, ECF No. 94-8 at 8. \n26 The Supreme Court recently made clear that disparate impact in the context of the FHA is not \nto be interpreted too broadly, stating that the “FHA is not an instrument to force housing \nauthorities to reorder their priorities,” and a “robust causality requirement is important.”  Tex. \nDep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (“ICP”), 135 S. Ct. 2507, \n2512, 2522 (2015).  This area of law is evolving as the circuit courts interpret this new language, \nwith circuit courts conflicting in their understanding and the future of disparate impact law under \nthe FHA uncertain.  Compare Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Lincoln Prop. Co., 920 F.3d \n890 (5th Cir. 2019), with Reyes v. Waples Mobile Home Park Ltd., 903 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. \n2018). \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 42 of 49 PageID #: 8812\npotential applicant pool for the Sand Castle by considering a variety of surrounding housing \nmarkets and analyzing several potential income ranges.  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9; \nSupplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10.  He concludes that for each income range \nand each housing market considered, the higher proportions of African-American and Latino \nindividuals compared to White individuals that would be adversely affected by a criminal record \nban is statistically significant.  Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 12; Supplemental Parnell \nReport, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 at 10.  In other words, Dr. Parnell opines that the disparity \nbetween those who would be impacted by such a ban who are African-American or Latino \ncompared to those who are White is not due to random chance.  Dr. Parnell does not analyze data \nspecific to the Sand Castle.     \nAlthough a reasonable fact-finder could credit Plaintiff’s experts’ testimony and other \nevidence to find Plaintiff proved a ban creates a disparate impact, Defendants raise sufficient \nchallenges regarding the underlying methodology and conclusions to make summary judgment \ninappropriate on this issue.  See Brown v. Cty. of Nassau, 736 F. Supp. 2d 602, 620 (E.D.N.Y. \n2010) (finding that where defendant challenged the methodology and conclusions of plaintiff’s \nunopposed expert, defendant was entitled to have the fact-finder evaluate the testimony and \ncredibility of the plaintiff’s expert); see also Penree v. City of Utica, No. 13 Civ. 1323 (MAD), \n2016 WL 915252, at *23 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2016) (finding that a “jury is free to refuse to credit \nan expert’s opinion even when there is no expert rebuttal”).  Although the decisions of Plaintiff’s \nexperts to rely on a broader potential applicant pool outside of the actual pool of Sand Castle \napplicants is reasoned, adequately based in law and sufficient for the Court to find the testimony \nadmissible, the more tangential nature of the analysis may diminish the weight a fact-finder \nwould afford the conclusions.  See Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 768 F. Supp. 2d 420, 433-\n42 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 43 of 49 PageID #: 8813\n34 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (“[I]t is not the role of the district court to make ultimate conclusions as to \nthe persuasiveness of the proffered evidence.”); see also In re Mirena, 169 F. Supp. 3d at 432 \nn.23.  In the same vein, the experts’ decisions to rely on incarceration data as a proxy for \nconviction, and the application of national statistics to the New York housing market, are \nappropriate decisions within the scope of an expert’s discretion, but they could decrease the \nweight a fact-finder would afford the experts’ conclusions as applied to the Sand Castle.  \n“[W]hile the threshold issue of whether a particular witness qualifies as an expert is one for the \njudge to determine, it is for the jury to decide what weight should be given to the testimony.”  \nHilaire v. DeWalt Indus. Tool Co., 54 F. Supp. 3d 223, 235 (E.D.N.Y. 2014); see Brown, 736 F. \nSupp. at 620 (“Courts have recognized that the grant of a motion for summary judgment is often \ninappropriate where the evidence bearing on crucial issues of fact is in the form of expert opinion \ntestimony.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Thus, even assuming the Sand Castle \nimplements some type of criminal record ban – a question of fact that remains open – Plaintiff \nhas not demonstrated as a matter of law that such a ban has a disparate impact on African-\nAmerican and Latino persons, and Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on this issue \nis denied. \nc.  The Record Is Underdeveloped Regarding Remaining Issues \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court finds a question of fact remains as to the first \nprong of the burden-shifting framework – whether the Sand Castle has the policy in question \nand, if so, whether that policy has a disparate impact on African-American and Latino \npersons.  In light of that determination, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the \ndisparate impact claim in Plaintiff’s favor.  Although this finding does not prohibit the Court \nfrom finding summary judgment in Defendants’ favor on this claim should the Court find for \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 44 of 49 PageID #: 8814\nDefendants on the second prong of the burden-shifting test, such a finding would be \ninappropriate at this stage because the record with respect to the second prong is \nunderdeveloped.   \nIn order to find summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiff’s disparate impact claim, \nthe Court would have to assume there was a ban, but find that Defendants had carried their \nburden on the second prong, showing a legitimate business reason for the ban.  Defendants have \nnot argued that they have a legitimate business reason for a criminal record ban and, in fact, they \n“concede that a blanket ban would not be narrowly tailored to balance the safety of the building \nand other tenants with the rights of a potential applicant.”  Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 38; see \nid. at 25; HUD Guidance, ECF No. 97-35 at 6 (“A housing provider that imposes a blanket \nprohibition on any person with any conviction record – no matter when the conviction occurred, \nwhat the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then – will be \nunable to meet this burden [of showing the policy or practice is necessary to achieve a \nsubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest].”).  Defendants instead argue that they have a \nlegitimate business reason for using the case-by-case review of applicants with criminal \nconvictions they claim to use.  Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 38.  Because the Court has not \ndetermined as a matter of law that the type of review on which Defendants’ argument is based is \napplied, it cannot grant Defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff’s \ndisparate impact claim.  There must first be a factual determination of whether a ban exists and \nthe scope of any such ban.   \nThe Court notes that the record is similarly underdeveloped with respect to the third \nprong of the burden-shifting framework.  The Supreme Court stated that “disparate-impact \nliability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 45 of 49 PageID #: 8815\nbusiness choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free-enterprise \nsystem.  And before rejecting a business justification . . . a court must determine that a plaintiff \nhas shown that there is an available alternative practice that has a less disparate impact and \nserves the entity’s legitimate needs.”  ICP, 135 S. Ct. at 2518 (alterations omitted).  Although \nPlaintiff argues that the Sand Castle could do a case-by-case assessment of each applicant’s \ncriminal history, it has not addressed the practicalities of its proposal in the context of the real \nestate industry.  Plaintiff itself notes that Mr. Tress did not know the difference between a \nmisdemeanor and a felony conviction, and neither Mr. Tress nor Ms. Campbell know how to \ndetermine the age of an applicant’s conviction or sentence.  Pl.’s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 120, 130, ECF \nNo. 94-2.  Yet it expects these same employees to make informed and thoughtful case-by-case \nassessments of an individual’s likelihood of recidivism and danger to the community.  Plaintiff \ndoes not explain where Defendants should obtain adequate information to conduct this in-depth \nanalysis or how Defendants should train their employees (or the costs and resources necessary \nfor such trainings), such that their employees could make considered and appropriate, rather than \narbitrary, determinations based on an applicant’s criminal background.   \nFor all of the reasons set forth above, summary judgment is denied for both Plaintiff and \nDefendants as to the disparate impact claim. \nVI.  DISPARATE TREATMENT DISCUSSION \n “A plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that \nanimus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the . . .  \ndecision-makers themselves or by those to whom the decision-makers were knowingly \nresponsive.”  Mhany Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 606 (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[A] district \ncourt facing a question of discriminatory intent must make ‘a sensitive inquiry into such \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 46 of 49 PageID #: 8816\ncircumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.  The impact of the official \naction whether it bears more heavily on one race than another may provide an important starting \npoint.’”  Id. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977)).  “[U]nless a clear pattern, \nunexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges, impact alone is not determinative and the \nCourt must look to other evidence.”  Id. (internal quotation marks & citation omitted).  This \nother evidence includes whether the historical background of the policy reveals a series of \nactions taken for invidious purposes, departures from normal procedure and contemporary \nstatements or information (the “Arlington factors”).  Id.  Here, Plaintiff has not offered evidence \nto suggest discriminatory intent.   \nPlaintiff’s assertion that Defendants’ building renovations and improvements demonstrate \nthat Defendants sought to attract higher income tenants, likely to skew white, Pl.’s Opp’n Mot., \nECF No. 98 at 41, is contradicted by the Regulatory Agreement, which restricts the complex to \nprimarily low-income tenants, Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 4-8, ECF No. 97-2; Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶¶ 4-8, ECF No. 98-2.  The only other evidence Plaintiff offers in support of its allegations \nof intentional discrimination is its “strong evidence of disparate impact.”  Pl.’s Opp’n Mot., ECF \nNo. 98 at 41.  Whether the impact of an action bears more heavily on one race than another is a \nrelevant factor in assessing discriminatory intent, but any such impact standing alone is \ninsufficient to sustain a disparate treatment claim.27  Mhany Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 606 (stating that \n                                                 \n27 Plaintiff relies on Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335 n.15, for the proposition that it need only show a \nstatistical disparity to support a disparate treatment claim.  “Outside the class context, however, \nprivate plaintiffs may not invoke the Teamsters method of proof as an independent and distinct \nmethod of establishing liability.”  Chin v. Port Auth. of NY & NJ, 685 F.3d 135, 150 (2d Cir. \n2012).    \n \n \n   \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 47 of 49 PageID #: 8817\n“impact alone is not determinative” of intent and “the Court must look to other evidence” \n(internal quotation marks & citations omitted)); see Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265 \n(“[D]isproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious \nracial discrimination.  Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.” (internal quotation marks & citation omitted)).  The \nCourt must consider the totality of the circumstances, and may look to the Arlington factors for \nguidance.  Rivera, 784 F. Supp. 2d at 147.     \nPlaintiff offers and the Court sees no evidence that any of the other Arlington factors \nsuggests discriminatory intent.  Plaintiff provides no evidence that the alleged decision by \nDefendants to exclude individuals with criminal histories was unusual or a departure from \nnormal procedure, nor does it offer any statements by Defendants or their agents suggesting \ndiscriminatory animus toward African-American or Latino persons.  Considering the totality of \ncircumstances in light of the Arlington factors, no reasonable fact-finder could find on the record \nbefore the Court that Defendants acted with discriminatory intent.  Accordingly, Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff’s claim of disparate treatment under the \nFHA, ECF No. 97-1 at 38-39, is granted. \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff’s state and city \nclaims for disparate treatment (NYSHRL, NY Executive Code § 296(5) & NYCHRL, \nAdministrative Code of City of NY § 8-107(5)) is also granted.  “NYSHRL, and NYCHRL \nhousing discrimination claims are analyzed under the same standard as claims made under the \nFHA” because they contain language that is substantively identical to that of the FHA, differing \nin that the NYSHRL and NYCHRL cover a broader range of protected classes.  Haber v. ASN \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 48 of 49 PageID #: 8818\n50th St. LLC, 847 F. Supp. 2d 578, 588 & n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).28  “Because Plaintiff’s claims of \nalleged discriminatory treatment under the FHA fail for lack of discriminatory animus, a \nrequisite element under the McDonnell Douglas test, Plaintiff’s state [and city] law \ndiscriminatory treatment claims also fail.”  Favourite v. 55 Halley St., Inc., No. 16 Civ. 4285 \n(NSR), 2019 WL 2226762, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2019); see Haber, 847 F. Supp. 2d at 588 \n& n.5. \n                                                 \n28 For the same reason, Plaintiff’s state and city law claims based on alleged disparate impact \nsurvive summary judgment.  See id.; Jackson v. Tryon Park Apartments, Inc., No. 18 Civ. 6238 \n(EAW), 2019 WL 331635, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2019) (“We have consistently held that the \nstandards for recovery under the New York Human Rights Law are in nearly all instances \nidentical to federal law.” (internal quotation marks, citations, & alterations omitted)); Williams v. \nNYCHA, 879 F. Supp. 2d 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (dismissing state and city disparate impact \nclaims because they were “analogs” of the FHA disparate impact claim, which had been \ndismissed). \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 141   Filed 07/03/19   Page 49 of 49 PageID #: 8819\nVII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is denied; \nDefendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment is denied with respect to Plaintiff’s disparate \nimpact claim and granted with respect to Plaintiff’s disparate treatment claim; Defendants’ \nmotion for dismissal based on lack of standing is denied.  Defendants’ motion to exclude the \ntestimony of Dr. Parnell is denied, and Plaintiff’s motion to exclude the testimony of Mr. Welsch \nis denied as moot, but may be renewed without prejudice for pre-trial motions.   \nAt the upcoming Status Conference, the Parties should be prepared to discuss the \nunderdeveloped areas referenced above, a timeline for submission of a joint pre-trial order, trial \nscheduling and any potential for settlement.  The Parties are to read and consider the Court’s \nalternative dispute resolution program information available on the Court’s website and discuss \nwhether they wish the Court to provide a referral.

Ordered by Magistrate Judge Vera M. \nScanlon on 2/3/2016. (Weingarten, Richard) (Entered: 02/03/2016) \n02/05/2016  72   RESPONSE in Opposition re 71 Letter MOTION for Extension of Time \nto Complete Discovery filed by The Fortune Society. (Attachments: \n# 1 Exhibit 1, # 2 Exhibit 2, # 3 Exhibit 3, # 4 Exhibit 4, # 5 Exhibit 5, \n# 6 Exhibit 6, # 7 Exhibit 7, # 8 Exhibit 8, # 9 Exhibit 9, # 10 Exhibit 10, \n# 11 Certificate of Service) (Burgess, Margaret) (Entered: 02/05/2016) \n02/16/2016     ORDER granting in part and denying in part 71 Motion for Extension of \nTime to Complete Discovery. At 71 , Defendants request a discovery \nextension in order to permit them to depose two expert witnesses and \nthree fact witnesses. Defendants' motion is granted insofar as they seek to \ndepose Plaintiff's two expert witnesses, but is denied in all other respects. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 16 allows a party to obtain a modification of a scheduling \norder \"only for good cause and with the judge's consent.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n16(b)(4). It is the movant's burden to establish good cause. See Parker v. \nColumbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir. 2000); Nairobi \nHoldings Ltd. v. Brown Bros. Harriman & Co., 02 Civ. 1230 (LMM), \n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54171, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2006). \"Whether \ngood cause exists turns on the diligence of the moving party.\" Holmes v. \nGrubman, 568 F.3d 329, 335 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted). \"With respect to a request to extend discovery, the \nmoving party must show why it could not have completed the necessary \ndiscovery within the time frame established under the existing scheduling \norder.\" Kintetsu World Express (USA), Inc. v. Johnson Controls Inc., 14 \nCiv. 4947 (KAM), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169190, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. \n17, 2015). \nAs per the Court's 12/23/2015 Order, depositions of fact witnesses were \nto be noticed by 12/31/2015, depositions of expert witnesses were to be \nnoticed by 1/22/2016, and all discovery, including depositions, was to be \ncompleted by 2/5/2016. Defendants noticed the five requested depositions \non 1/29/2016. According to Defendants' counsel, notice was provided at \nsuch a late stage because: (1) deposition testimony of their own clients \nand witnesses provided a sudden need to depose the three fact witnesses; \nand (2) documents belatedly received via subpoena from third-parties \n\nprovided a need to depose Plaintiff's two expert witnesses. Plaintiff \ncounters that the three fact witnesses Defendants seek to depose were \nidentified long ago in Plaintiff's Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) disclosures and that \nthe documents just recently received by Defendants are irrelevant to the \nassertions made by their experts. \nDefendants have not shown good cause to allow them to belatedly depose \nthe three fact witnesses. Plaintiff identified these three fact witnesses in \nits Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) disclosures and, to the extent deposition \ntestimony from Defendants or witnesses on their behalf provided some \ntype of amorphous reason to depose these three fact witnesses, \nDefendants' counsel otherwise knew, or should have known, of this \ninformation prior to said depositions. This Court, however, will credit \nDefendants' counsel's claim that the documents just recently received via \nsubpoena had an effect on their decision to depose Plaintiff's experts, thus \ntriggering good cause to extend the discovery schedule only in that \nregard. \nIn light of the foregoing, Defendants may depose Plaintiff's two experts \nby or before 3/11/2016. The parties' briefing schedule, as previously \nOrdered by the Court on 12/23/2015, is modified as follows: opening \nsummary judgment briefs, including the statement of material facts, must \nbesubmitted to the party in opposition by 4/11/2016. Briefs in opposition \nto summary judgment must be submitted by 5/9/2016. Reply briefs, if \nany, must be submitted by 5/23/2016. On the due date prescribed, briefs \nwill be submitted to the party in opposition only. No brief will be filed \nwith the Court until the close of the briefing period on 5/23/2016. At the \nclose of the briefing period, any party who filed affirmatively for \nsummary judgment will file its opening brief, the brief in opposition, and \nits reply brief.

JURY DEMAND \n1465A Flatbush Ave.   \nBrooklyn, NY 11210   \n   \nSARASOTA GOLD LLC               \n1407 48th Street   \nBrooklyn, NY 11219 \n \nand \n \nWEISSMAN REALTY GROUP LLC \n45 Broadway, 12th Floor \nNew York, NY 10006 \n     \n \n                       Defendants. \n   \n \n \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n \n1.  The Fortune Society (“Fortune”) brings this suit pursuant to the Fair Housing Act \nof 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., for injunctive, monetary and declarative relief \nagainst Defendants Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corporation (“HDFC”), \nSarasota Gold LLC (“Sarasota Gold”), and Weissman Realty Group LLC (“Weissman”) for \nengaging in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination on the basis of race and color at The \nSand Castle, a multi-building apartment complex they own and manage in Queens, New York.  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 2 of 43 PageID #: 2\n \nSpecifically, Defendants maintain and enforce a policy of automatically excluding any person \nwith a record of a criminal conviction from renting or living in an apartment at The Sand Castle.  \nDefendants explicitly confirmed this policy to Fortune twice in the summer of 2013.  The policy \nexcludes all such people regardless of the nature of the conviction, the amount of time that has \nlapsed since the conviction, evidence of rehabilitation, or any other factor related to whether a \nspecific person poses any threat to safety.  Pursuant to this stated policy, Defendants repeatedly \nrefused to permit Fortune to rent apartments at The Sand Castle on behalf of its clients because \nthose clients have criminal histories.1  Defendants’ policy has the purpose and effect of \ndiscriminating against African Americans and Latinos, including Fortune’s clients, in violation \nof the Fair Housing Act and New York State and City law. \n2.  Fortune is a not-for-profit organization that for nearly fifty years has been \ndedicated to the successful reentry and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals in New \nYork City (“the City”).  It is one of the leading organizations in the country addressing and \nhelping individuals overcome reentry issues.  Fortune has been lauded nationally and \ninternationally for the innovation, quality, and effectiveness of its programs.  Just this summer \nFortune’s Senior Vice President of Programs, himself a formerly incarcerated African-American \nman, was named a “Champion of Change” by the White House for his work at Fortune. \n3.  Fortune serves approximately 5,000 clients a year.  Approximately 95% of its \nclients are African-American or Latino.  Fortune provides comprehensive services to these \nclients by operating housing, education, employment, health, and case management programs, \namong others. \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this Complaint, “criminal history” and “criminal record” refer to a prior criminal conviction. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 3 of 43 PageID #: 3\n \n4.  One of Fortune’s principal tasks is to secure housing for its clients and their \nfamilies.  Fortune provides temporary and permanent housing for hundreds of formerly \nincarcerated individuals each year.  It does so by running “scattered-site” programs that place \nclients in private rental housing throughout the City and by operating two housing facilities itself \nin West Harlem.  The two facilities are The Fortune Academy and Castle Gardens. \n5.  Many of Fortune’s housing programs work as a pipeline, with individuals moving \nfrom emergency to “phased permanent” to permanent housing as part of their successful \nreintegration.  Being able to move people to the end of the pipeline opens up more space at the \nbeginning and allows Fortune to serve more clients. \n6.  In some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs, Fortune leases apartments and pays \nthe rent itself.  Its clients provide some reimbursement, which encourages a sense of personal \ninvestment and responsibility.  Some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs serve specific \nsegments of the formerly-incarcerated population, such as people who are HIV-positive, or \ncertain regions of the City.  Fortune has developed relationships with over 100 landlords to \nfacilitate its scattered-site housing and regularly seeks out new locations for these programs. \n7.  The Fortune Academy includes an 18-bed emergency housing unit and a “phased-\npermanent” unit that serves 41 people who transfer from the emergency unit when Fortune staff \ndetermine they are ready to live independently, subject to the availability of space.  Individuals \nstay in the phased-permanent housing until they are ready to transition to permanent housing \nelsewhere.  Such permanent housing is often located through Fortune’s scattered-site programs.  \nAt Castle Gardens, Fortune provides affordable permanent housing that integrates formerly-\nincarcerated people with other low-income families.  The demand for space at Fortune Academy \nand Castle Gardens substantially exceeds the space that is available. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 4 of 43 PageID #: 4\n \n8.  In the summer of 2013 and again in early 2014, Fortune tried to rent apartments \nfor its clients at The Sand Castle under one of its scattered-site programs that required that \napartments be located in Queens.  The Sand Castle is a four-building apartment complex with \nover 900 rental units in Far Rockaway, Queens.  It is owned and managed by Defendants.  \nFortune wanted to rent units at The Sand Castle because the complex is an ideal fit for its clients: \namong other things, The Sand Castle suits Fortune’s clients well because it is located in a safe \nand racially diverse community that is readily accessible to public transportation, which its \nclients rely on heavily.  In addition, units at The Sand Castle fit the budget for the scattered-site \nprogram. \n9.  When Defendants learned that Fortune serves formerly incarcerated individuals \nwho would live in the apartments Fortune wanted to rent, they refused to rent apartments to \nFortune.  This refusal, they told Fortune, was because they maintain and enforce a policy \nprohibiting anyone with a criminal record from renting an apartment or living at The Sand \nCastle.  This type of “blanket ban” policy has become increasingly common in housing due to \nthe increased accessibility of inexpensive background checks via the Internet.  As a direct result \nof Defendants’ repeated application of their blanket ban policy against Fortune, some of \nFortune’s clients have been forced to remain homeless or in substandard or unsafe housing \nsubstantially longer than they otherwise would have while Fortune searched for alternative \nhousing.  In several cases, clients found eligible for scattered-site housing in the Queens program \nwere residing in The Fortune Academy and had to remain there longer than necessary, thus \noccupying beds that could have been utilized to house other homeless individuals. \n10.  Defendants’ actions have directly and significantly diminished and frustrated \nFortune’s ability to provide safe and stable housing for its clients, which is a central part of its \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 5 of 43 PageID #: 5\n \nmission of assisting formerly-incarcerated individuals with reentry and reintegration.  In addition \nto frustrating Fortune’s ability to provide housing to its clients, these actions have caused \nFortune to expend substantial additional resources to identify alternative housing options for its \nclients and to increase advocacy efforts, and forced Fortune to divert resources from other \nprogrammatic activities to counteract Defendants’ conduct. \n11.  Locally and nationally, blanket bans like the one maintained and enforced by \nDefendants against Fortune are discriminatory and have a clear and unlawful disparate impact on \nAfrican Americans and Latinos.  The disproportionate rates of conviction and incarceration of \nAfrican Americans and Latinos, as compared to whites, are well-documented.2  This \ndisproportionality is clear in New York City, New York State, and the United States as a whole.  \nAfrican Americans and Latinos are likewise significantly overrepresented compared to whites \namong individuals released from prison each year, i.e., Fortune’s clients.  Banning people from \nsafe and affordable housing based solely on a criminal conviction thereby has a predictable and \nlarge adverse impact on African Americans and Latinos.  In the analogous context of \nemployment bans, this is exactly what the United States Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (“EEOC”) has found by analyzing national criminal records data.3 \n12.  Analysis of criminal records and other data likewise shows that the blanket ban \nmaintained by Defendants at The Sand Castle has a severe disparate impact on the basis of race \nand color.  African-American men who live in New York City and satisfy Defendants’ other \nresidency requirements for The Sand Castle are at least three times as likely as whites to be \nexcluded by Defendants’ prohibition against people with records, and Latino men are almost four \n                                                 \n2 “White” is used herein to refer to non-Hispanic Caucasians. \n \n3 See generally U.S. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n, EEOC Enforcement Guidance, Number 915.002 (Apr. 25, \n2012), http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 6 of 43 PageID #: 6\n \nand one-half times as likely as whites to be excluded.  The disparities may actually be much \ngreater because these figures are based on a conservative statistical analysis.  \n13.  Under the Fair Housing Act and New York law, a policy that has a disparate \nimpact may be permissible if it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose that cannot \nbe satisfied with a less discriminatory alternative.  That is not the case here.  A clear and \nobviously less discriminatory alternative for dealing with any potential concerns raised by \napplicants with criminal records is available to Defendants – one that is already established in the \narea of employment discrimination law and regulation. \n14.   Instead of applying a blanket ban, Defendants could assess potential residents \nwith criminal records individually by considering factors directly relevant to appropriate \nqualifications for tenancy.  This could include the nature of the conviction or(?) conduct, how \nlong ago it occurred, the age of the person at the time of the conviction, post-conviction and \npost-release conduct, evidence of rehabilitation, evidence of any current threat to safety, letters \nof recommendation, the individual’s history as a tenant and as a whole, and other factors.  The \nEEOC applies a presumption in the employment context that, because of the racially disparate \nimpact of blanket bans, precisely such an individualized assessment is required by law and \nsufficient to protect legitimate interests such as safety.4  The EEOC’s sound rationale applies \nwith equal force to housing. \n15.  Through an individualized assessment, Defendants would maintain the ability to \nreview carefully all Sand Castle applicants while permitting prospective tenants who have \ncriminal records, but pose no realistic threat to the community, to obtain housing.  This more \ntailored approach would protect public safety equally well, yet it would be less discriminatory \n                                                 \n4 Id. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 7 of 43 PageID #: 7\n \nand exclusionary because it would reduce the number of African Americans and Latinos \nprevented from securing housing at The Sand Castle.    \n16.  Using individualized assessments to reduce the impact of blanket bans, including \nDefendants’ blanket ban at The Sand Castle, is crucial both for individuals who were formerly \nincarcerated and for the health of our communities.  Recidivism rates are much higher for \nreentrants who do not find safe and permanent housing, and recidivism impacts the whole \nsurrounding community.  For Fortune’s clients and other reentrants, successful reintegration \ngreatly depends on having a suitable home.  Quite properly, housing has been called the \n“lynchpin that holds the reintegration process together.”5 \n17.  The importance to individuals and communities of promoting successful \nreintegration by meeting the housing needs of the formerly incarcerated has grown alongside the \nrapid growth in the number of people imprisoned in the United States.  In 1980, 300,000 people \nin the United States were imprisoned.  Today over 2.3 million are imprisoned, many for non-\nviolent crimes.  Nearly everyone who is currently imprisoned will be released and will need to \nfind housing.  Moreover, the pace of people being released will increase in the near term because \nthe United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to reduce sentencing ranges for \ncertain drug offenses and to apply the changes retroactively where justified by individualized \nconsideration, and because of a large-scale initiative by the United States to expedite \nconsideration of clemency for the many non-violent, low-level federal offenders who have \nalready served substantial time in prison.6 \n                                                 \n5 Jeremy Travis, But They All Come Back: Facing Challenges of Prisoner Reentry 219 (2005). \n \n6 See generally U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, Office of Research and Data, Summary of Key Data Regarding \nRetroactive Application of the 2014 Drug Guidelines Amendment (July 25, 2014), \nhttp://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/retroactivity-analyses/drug-guidelines-\n7 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 8 of 43 PageID #: 8\n \n18.  Blanket bans maintained by Defendants and other landlords, however, present \nformidable and often insurmountable obstacles for formerly incarcerated individuals like \nFortune’s clients.  By blocking the path to safe, permanent, and affordable housing, these bans \nalso block the path to social and economic stability for many otherwise qualified and deserving \npeople without regard to the nature of their past crime or how far they have since come.  Blanket \nbans also create a chilling effect, discouraging potential tenants from even applying for tenancy \nin the first place.  Eliminating such unnecessary obstacles from their paths is both sound policy \nand required by the Fair Housing Act.    \n19.  Defendants’ blanket ban is based on racially discriminatory stereotypes about \nthose with criminal records.  Indeed, the discriminatory impact of Defendants’ policy is so large, \nand the less discriminatory alternative so obvious, that unlawful racially discriminatory intent \ncan be inferred.  Fortune contends that Defendants knew that people with criminal records, \nincluding Fortune’s clients, are disproportionately African-American and Latino.  Defendants \nunderstood the adverse impact their policy has on the racial make-up of its property, and \ndeliberately and purposefully pursued that outcome.   \n20.  Defendants’ deliberate and purposeful conduct is consistent with their other \nefforts to remake the image of The Sand Castle after Defendant Sarasota Gold purchased it in \n2006.  Defendants employed measures to attract wealthier white tenants and gentrify the \nbuilding, including advertisements emphasizing white models.  These efforts are consistent with \nengaging in intentional discrimination in order to limit the number of minority tenants in the \nbuilding. \n                                                 \namendment/20140725-Drug-Retro-Analysis.pdf.

THE FORTUNE SOCIETY AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO RENT APARTMENTS \nFOR ITS CLIENTS AT THE SAND CASTLE   \n \nA.  Fortune’s Mission and Programs \n32.  Founded in 1967, The Fortune Society’s mission is to help incarcerated and \nformerly incarcerated individuals become contributing members of society and to offer \nalternatives to incarceration.  Fortune offers a holistic array of programs for formerly \nincarcerated, low-income persons in New York City through a “one-stop shop” model of services \nthat includes housing, case management, counseling, education, employment services, substance \nabuse treatment, family services, health services, and mental health services, among others.  \nFortune routinely engages in education and advocacy to promote the creation of a fair, humane, \nand truly rehabilitative correctional system. \n33.  Fortune serves approximately 5,000 individuals annually.  African Americans and \nLatinos comprise over 95% of Fortune’s clients. \n34.  Fortune is widely regarded as one of the leading organizations in the country \nconfronting the myriad reentry issues faced by formerly incarcerated individuals.  Fortune’s \nprograms are recognized nationally and internationally for their innovation, quality, and \neffectiveness, including in reducing rates of recidivism.  Just this summer the White House \nnamed Fortune’s Senior Vice-President of Programs a “Champion of Change” for his \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 12 of 43 PageID #: 12\n \neffectiveness in helping formerly incarcerated men and women achieve and maintain \nemployment.  Also this summer, Governor Cuomo appointed Fortune’s CEO to the new \nstatewide Council on Community Re-Entry and Reintegration.  Fortune’s housing has been \nfunded as a Special Project of National Significance by the United States Health Resources and \nServices Administration and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) and Fortune has received accolades from numerous organizations as a provider of \nmodel reentry programs.   \n35.  Because of the vital importance of safe and stable housing to successful reentry, \none of Fortune’s principal tasks is to secure housing for its clients and their families.  This is \ncentral to Fortune’s mission.  Each year Fortune provides temporary or permanent housing for \nmore than 300 formerly incarcerated people.   \n36.  Many of Fortune’s housing programs, described immediately below, work \ntogether as a pipeline.  Clients move from emergency to phased-permanent units at the Fortune \nAcademy, and then to permanent housing.  Moving clients from temporary to permanent housing \nis of critical importance to this process.  By helping clients who are ready to live independently \nmove from Fortune’s temporary housing to permanent housing, Fortune creates additional space \nin its temporary housing programs.  Without this additional space, Fortune cannot serve new \nclients in need of emergency or phased-permanent housing.  Fortune always faces a backlog of \npeople who need its help in securing such housing. \n1.  Emergency and Phased-Permanent Housing: Fortune Academy \n \n37.  The Fortune Academy is a housing facility in West Harlem that is owned and \noperated by The Fortune Society.  The Fortune Academy offers both emergency and phased-\npermanent housing for approximately 60 formerly incarcerated individuals who are homeless. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 13 of 43 PageID #: 13\n \n38.  In addition to providing housing, The Fortune Academy works with participants \nto develop needed tools for social reintegration, employment, independence, sobriety, and the \ntransition to the private mainstream housing market.  Through these extensive reentry services \nand programs, Fortune Academy residents learn how to address the issues that led to their \nincarceration and homelessness.  This comprehensive approach is instrumental to the success of \nFortune’s housing clients in achieving and maintaining positive, self-sufficient, and crime-free \nlives.  \n39.  The Fortune Academy’s emergency housing unit includes 18 beds plus some \noverflow capacity.  Rooms in the emergency unit house three to seven people at a time and do \nnot include cooking facilities.   \n40.  Demand for emergency beds at The Fortune Academy is always high because \nmany people are released every week from jail and prison into local communities and have no \nviable housing options.  The emergency unit is consistently filled to capacity, and Fortune is \nconstantly forced to turn people away.   \n41.  The emergency unit’s waiting list is frequently several months long.  Making as \nmany beds available as possible is critical to Fortune’s mission. \n42.  Fortune’s model is to move individuals housed in the emergency unit to \ntransitional or permanent housing within 45 days, but individuals often stay for as many as eight \nor nine months, in part because there are so few affordable housing options available to the \nformerly incarcerated in New York City.  This is due in significant part to blanket bans on people \nwith criminal records imposed by private landlords. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 14 of 43 PageID #: 14\n \n43.  Fortune clients who have been in emergency housing and are assessed by Fortune \nAcademy staff as ready to live independently are eligible for placement in the Academy’s \nphased-permanent unit if space is available.   \n44.  The phased-permanent unit houses 41 people.  Rooms in the phased-permanent \nprogram are apartment-style singles or doubles that include amenities such as cooking \nequipment. \n45.  When a vacancy opens in the phased-permanent unit, Academy staff select an \nindividual from the emergency unit who has demonstrated his or her readiness to live more \nindependently with the help of continued supportive services from Fortune. \n46.  Fortune clients housed in the phased-permanent unit typically remain there until \nthey can make the transition to permanent housing.  The process of finding and moving into \npermanent housing often takes a year or more, again in significant part because of blanket bans \nthat exclude individuals with criminal histories from living in rental housing.  \n2.  Permanent Housing: Scattered-Site Programs and Castle Gardens \n \n47.  Fortune also operates programs to provide safe and stable permanent housing for \nits clients, including several scattered-site programs.  \n48.  Fortune’s scattered-site programs are initiatives through which Fortune places \nclients in private rental housing throughout New York City.  Through these programs, Fortune \nhas developed relationships with New York City landlords and management companies to \nidentify safe and affordable apartments for clients who Fortune determines are ready to live \nindependently. \n49.  Fortune places its scattered-site clients through a variety of methods.  Some \nclients are placed in private housing owned or managed by landlords or management companies \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 15 of 43 PageID #: 15\n \nwith which Fortune already has an established relationship.  Other clients are placed in private \nhousing with the assistance of a licensed real-estate broker retained by Fortune for that specific \npurpose.  Housing specialists on Fortune’s staff also actively seek out new private landlords who \nare willing to house its clients. \n50.  Fortune itself often enters into residential leases with participating landlords.  In \nthese circumstances, Fortune is responsible for making all rental payments to the landlord.  \nScattered-site program participants then enter into an occupancy agreement with Fortune and \npartially reimburse Fortune for a share of the rent each month by paying 30% of their income to \nFortune.  Partial reimbursement facilitates a sense of personal investment and responsibility \nwhile maintaining affordability for Fortune’s clients. \n51.  The scattered-site programs are funded from a variety of public and private \ngrants.  The grants Fortune receives often have geographical or programmatic restrictions.  This \nmeans that Fortune may only be able to use a grant to house clients in a particular area of the \nCity or to assist only a specific subset of its client population, such as people who are HIV-\npositive.  Potential participants in Fortune’s scattered-site programs are carefully evaluated by \nFortune’s staff to assess their readiness for independent living and their fit for specific programs.  \nIf Fortune staff determine that an individual is an appropriate candidate for a program, Fortune’s \nhousing specialists begin the process of helping that person find an apartment in the private \nrental market.  Fortune’s own Castle Gardens is one option for clients who are ready for \npermanent housing, but it is a very limited one.  Castle Gardens is a 114-unit residential building \nin West Harlem that Fortune opened in 2010.  It provides homes and on-site social services for \nformerly-incarcerated people as well as other low-income families.  Openings are infrequent and \nunpredictable, however.  Like any other typical apartment building in New York City, once an \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 16 of 43 PageID #: 16\n \nindividual becomes a Castle Gardens resident, he or she may remain there indefinitely.  As a \nresult, Fortune typically cannot look to Castle Gardens to solve its need to locate housing for \nclients who are prepared to succeed in permanent housing. \nB.  Fortune’s Inability to Rent Apartments for Clients at The Sand Castle \nBecause of Defendants’ Blanket Criminal Record Ban \n \n52.  Due to the perpetual need to expand housing options for its prospective and \ncurrent clients, Fortune’s staff is constantly searching for more private landlords willing to house \nFortune clients through its scattered-site programs.  As part of this search, Fortune attempted to \nplace clients at The Sand Castle, a large apartment complex in Far Rockaway, Queens, which is \nowned by Defendants Sarasota Gold and HDFC and managed on the owners’ behalf by \nDefendant Weissman.  \n53.  Defendant Sarasota Gold bought The Sand Castle in or around 2006 for $98 \nmillion.  While the building had been largely occupied by seniors, the new owners planned an \nimage makeover and raised their rents.  Posters were placed in the lobby encouraging potential \ntenants to “Live the Life You’ve Always Dreamed.”  Advertisements for the complex and The \nSand Castle website featured smiling young, white, blond models.  Unit floor plans were labeled \nwith British-sounding references like “Ardsley,” “Dover,” and “Stanton.”  Defendants’ goal was \nto present a more “upscale,” gentrified image, one that deemphasized the presence of minority \nneighbors. \n54.  Fortune became aware of The Sand Castle after receiving a housing assistance \ngrant from New York State in 2013 that provides funding for exactly 25 residential units in \nQueens.   \n55.  Through its research, Fortune determined that The Sand Castle would be an ideal \nsite to house program participants.  Specifically, The Sand Castle is located in a relatively safe \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 17 of 43 PageID #: 17\n \nand racially diverse area within the grant’s geographical limitation, and in a neighborhood in \nwhich there are already Fortune clients.  Having a number of clients located in the same \ngeographical area allows Fortune to more effectively utilize its case management staff by \nreducing travel time, reducing costs, and supporting greater intensity of services.   \n56.  The waterfront property features numerous amenities, including a fitness center, \nsupermarket, on-site medical facilities, and a doorman.  The Jewish Association Serving the \nAging has facilities located in the building.  The Sand Castle is also convenient to public \ntransportation relied upon by Fortune’s clients.    \n57.  Additionally, and of critical importance to Fortune, The Sand Castle’s rents are \naffordable and fit well within Fortune’s grant budget.  Studio apartments are available for as little \nas approximately $1,000 per month and one-bedroom apartments start at approximately $1,300 \nper month.    \n58.  The Sand Castle has over 900 apartments and, upon information and belief, has \nhad sufficient availability at all times relevant to this Complaint to provide units to Fortune \nand/or its clients. \n59.  In or around May 2013, in a transaction handled by Fortune’s then real-estate \nagent, Fortune entered into leases with Defendant Sarasota Gold for four apartments at The Sand \nCastle.  Fortune is listed as the tenant for each apartment and is solely responsible for all rental \npayments pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements.  \n60.  At the time that Defendants entered into these lease agreements with Fortune, The \nSand Castle’s management knew that Fortune intended to use the units for its housing program \nand that it intended to sub-lease the apartments to program clients.  The Sand Castle’s \nmanagement did not know, however, the nature of the Fortune program or that Fortune served \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 18 of 43 PageID #: 18\n \nindividuals with criminal records.  Moreover, Defendants had no specific knowledge that \nFortune’s sub-lessees had criminal records.  The Sand Castle did not request any financial or \nother background information from Fortune about potential sub-lessees. \n61.  In or around July 2013, a Fortune housing specialist visited The Sand Castle’s \nleasing office to pick up keys for the apartments that had been leased to Fortune.  While there, \nthe housing specialist asked a Sand Castle employee about the possibility of Fortune leasing \nmore apartments in the building for its clients.  The employee responded that Fortune would \nneed to contact building management.  Fortune subsequently contacted The Sand Castle’s \nmanagement on several occasions to explore the possibility of leasing additional apartments to \nhouse more Fortune clients.  The individuals with whom Fortune staff members spoke on these \noccasions were, upon information and belief, employees or agents of Defendant Weissman. \n62.  During Fortune’s encounters with Weissman, Weissman learned that Fortune \nserves clients who have criminal records.  Upon learning that Fortune’s clients have criminal \nrecords, Weissman immediately denied Fortune’s request to lease any more apartments at The \nSand Castle.  In doing so, Weissman explicitly and unequivocally told Fortune’s staff that The \nSand Castle’s apartments are not available to people with criminal records.  \n63.  The first of these discussions with Weissman took place in the summer of 2013 \nwhen a Fortune staff member spoke with Melissa Gursky, who was working in a Sand Castle \nmanagement capacity.  Fortune explained the organization’s mission and programs.  In response, \nMs. Gursky articulated The Sand Castle’s blanket ban policy, explicitly telling the Fortune staff \nmember that The Sand Castle “does not house ex-offenders” (or similar words to that effect).  \n64.  Also in the summer of 2013, a different Fortune staff member called Defendant \nWeissman.  The Fortune employee explained that he worked for Fortune, that Fortune helps \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 19 of 43 PageID #: 19\n \nformerly incarcerated people find housing, and that Fortune was interested in leasing additional \napartments at The Sand Castle.  In response, Weissman stated that, “we don’t allow ex-offenders \non the property and we do not rent to programs” (or similar words to that effect).  The assertion \nthat The Sand Castle does not rent to programs was demonstrably false because Defendants had \nleased apartments to Fortune in the spring knowing that it was a “program” (but not knowing the \nnature of the program). \n65.  In this same conversation, Fortune explained that the stated ban on the formerly \nincarcerated “appears to be discriminatory” (or similar words to that effect).  Weissman \nresponded by repeating that The Sand Castle does not accept formerly incarcerated individuals as \nresidents.  Fortune asked when the exclusionary policy was adopted, but Weissman refused to \nanswer. \n66.  Although Defendant Weissman made clear that The Sand Castle does not permit \nresidents with criminal records, Defendants agreed to honor the leases that Defendant Sarasota \nGold had entered into with Fortune when it was unaware that Fortune’s clients were formerly \nincarcerated individuals. \n67.  Fortune again contacted The Sand Castle in early 2014 to determine whether \nDefendants had rescinded their blanket ban against people with criminal records and whether \nFortune could lease additional apartments for its clients.  Fortune’s employee spoke with \nDefendants’ agent or employee, Sruly Tress. \n68.  Fortune first confirmed that The Sand Castle had vacant apartments available for \nrent.  Fortune told Mr. Tress that its clients have criminal backgrounds and reminded Mr. Tress \nthat Fortune had clients who had been living in the building without incident.  Mr. Tress \nexplicitly acknowledged that The Sand Castle had not experienced any problems with those \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 20 of 43 PageID #: 20\n \nresidents.  Fortune made clear that it was willing to provide Defendants with any information \nthey reasonably required regarding the backgrounds of individual tenants who would occupy the \napartments that Fortune wanted to rent. \n69.  Mr. Tress responded by telling Fortune that tenants with criminal histories “scare” \nmanagement and that criminal records are a “red flag.”  He did, however, state that he would \ncheck with Defendants’ upper-level management about whether Fortune would be permitted to \nrent additional units.   \n70.  Mr. Tress contacted Fortune shortly thereafter and told Fortune it would not be \nallowed to lease additional units in The Sand Castle.  Mr. Tress told Fortune that The Sand \nCastle did not wish to conduct any further business with Fortune. \nII.  DEFENDANTS’ REJECTION OF FORTUNE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR \nBLANKET BAN AGAINST RESIDENTS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS \nCONSTITUTES UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION \n \n71.  Facially neutral housing practices that have a disparate impact on the basis of race \nor color are prohibited by the Fair Housing Act unless they are necessary to achieve a legitimate \nbusiness purpose that cannot be satisfied through a less discriminatory alternative practice.  \nBlanket bans that automatically deny housing to people with criminal records, including the \nblanket ban maintained and enforced by Defendants at The Sand Castle, are unlawful under this \nstandard.  Such bans have a severe disparate impact on African Americans and Latinos, and any \nlegitimate safety concerns can be satisfied through the less discriminatory alternative of giving \nindividualized consideration to each potential resident’s circumstances and desirability as a \ntenant. \n72.  Moreover, the disparate impact of a facially neutral housing practice may be so \nstark and foreseeable that it demonstrates an unlawful intent to discriminate.  That is also the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 21 of 43 PageID #: 21\n \ncase here.  Because of well-known racial disparities regarding people with criminal records, \nDefendants’ blanket ban operates to disqualify otherwise qualified African Americans and \nLatinos from living at The Sand Castle at a rate at least three to four and one-half times the rate \nat which whites are disqualified.  By implementing and maintaining their blanket ban at The \nSand Castle, Defendants have been and continue to be engaged in intentional discrimination.  \nDefendants’ ban is consistent with a policy of limiting the number of new minority tenants in the \nbuilding.  \n73.  Defendants have also made concerted efforts to change The Sand Castle’s image \nand to present it as more “upscale,” including through its print and online advertising, which \nprominently feature young, white men and women.  These efforts are consistent with a policy of \npurposefully attracting white tenants and dissuading others from applying.   \nA.  Blanket Bans in General Disproportionately and Severely Impact African \nAmericans and Latinos at the National, State, and City Levels \n \n74.  Seven-hundred thousand inmates are released from confinement each year and \nbecome new targets of blanket bans.7  They are disproportionately African-American and Latino \nbecause the inmate population as a whole is disproportionately African-American and Latino, \nand 95% of inmates are eventually released.8 \n75.  In New York State, more than 50% of the 25,060 inmates released in 2009 were \nAfrican-American and over 25% were Latino.9  Yet the State’s general population is only 15.9% \n                                                 \n7 Ann E.

Of the nearly 600,000 inmates released by the New York \nState Department of Correction from 1985 to 2009, over half were African-American and nearly \none-third were Latino.10   \n76.  Most of those released from New York State prisons – nearly two-thirds since \n1985 – go to New York City to live.11  In 2011, New York City’s own Department of Correction \nreleased 88,000 people from its disproportionately African-American and Latino inmate \npopulation.12  The reentering population in New York City is therefore very large as well as \ndisproportionately minority. \n77.  Unlike African Americans and Latinos, whites are incarcerated, and therefore \nreleased from jails and prisons, at rates significantly lower than their representation in the \ngeneral population at the national, New York State, and New York City levels. \n78.  In addition to the large number of prisoners already being released, more than \n46,000 additional federal prisoners are expected to become eligible for early release over the \nnext several years.  In April 2014, the United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously \nto retroactively apply lower sentencing ranges for certain drug offenses.  This will permit \nprisoners currently serving under these offenses to apply for early release.  Approximately 75% \nof the prisoners eligible to apply are African-American or Latino.13 \n                                                 \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 New York City Dept. of Correction, 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2012, Oct.-Dec.

The sheer number of people released from prison every year has skyrocketed \nlargely because the incarcerated population in the United States has grown from 300,000 in 1980 \nto more than 2.3 million today.  Approximately 10 million misdemeanor cases are filed every \nyear.14  An additional 12 million people across the country have at least one felony conviction.15  \nAt the same time, it has become much easier and common for housing providers to identify and \nban people with criminal records because of the growth of companies that provide inexpensive \nbackground checks via the Internet. \n80.  The dramatic increase in the number of incarcerated people over these years is \ndue largely to the widespread policy of pursuing non-violent drug offenders.  Non-violent drug \noffenses alone account for two-thirds of the rise in the federal inmate population and more than \nhalf of the rise in state prisoners between 1985 and 2000.   \n81.  The national prison population is now comprised overwhelmingly of individuals \nconvicted of non-violent crimes.  As of 2010, less than 10% of the federal prison population had \nbeen convicted of a violent crime.16 \n82.  The massive increase in incarceration and in the number of people with criminal \nconvictions has hit African Americans and Latinos especially hard.  They are incarcerated at \nrates significantly disproportionate to their numbers in the United States general population.  \n                                                 \n14 Alexandra Natapoff, Misdemeanors, 85 S.

Men overwhelmingly comprise the nation’s inmate population and the disparities \nby race are especially stark among the male population.  African Americans represent 13% of the \nUnited States male population but over 40% of the more than two million men currently \nincarcerated.  Based on national incarceration data, the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that \n1 in 3 African-American men will go to prison at some point in their lifetime.  For Latino men, \nthe rate of expected incarceration is 1 in 6.  For white men, the figure is only 1 in 17.19  That is, \nAfrican-American men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men, and Latino \nmen are almost three times more likely to be incarcerated than white men.20   \n84.  The above-referenced disparities persist across categories of crime, such as drug \npossession. \n85.  New York State and New York City race and incarceration statistics mirror the \nnational data.  Of the 54,235 inmates under State custody on January 1, 2013, 49.5% were \n                                                 \n17 See generally NAACP, Criminal Justice Factsheet (2009), http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-\nsheet. \n \n18 See U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012, Table 6 (2012), \nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012edition.html. \n \n19 The Sentencing Project, Report of the Sentencing Project to the United Nations Human Rights Committee: \nRegarding Racial Disparties in the United States Criminal Justice System 1 (Aug. 2013), \nhttp://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%\n2Fsentencingproject.org%2Fdoc%2Fpublications%2Frd_ICCPR%2520Race%2520and%2520Justice%2520Shadow\n%2520Report.pdf&ei=3zdRVLmII-nasATY64AI&v6u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-v6exp1-\nds.metric.gstatic.com%2Fgen_204%3Fip%3D50.242.218.113%26ts%3D1414608864553895%26auth%3Dfg6dk3vi\ntleto2x3z4zvhqfeu6bstw25%26rndm%3D0.46951305062984383&v6s=2&v6t=2831&usg=AFQjCNH3mh3wqJlc32\nhwhRKt75FxmCBWrg&sig2=X1vmoYBfe_jMR-AbtEozqA&bvm=bv.78597519,d.cWc \n \n20 Id.  \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 25 of 43 PageID #: 25\n \nAfrican-American and 24% were Latino.21  Yet the State’s general population is just 15.9% \nAfrican-American and 17.6% Latino.  \n86.  Of the 12,386 City inmates in custody on December 31, 2012, 57% were African-\nAmerican and 33% were Latino.22  The City’s general population, however, is only 25.5% \nAfrican-American and 28.6% Latino. \n87.  Much of the disparity in New York is due to the fact that African Americans are \nsignificantly more likely than whites to be arrested for drug-possession. 23  For example, African \nAmericans are four times as likely as whites to be arrested for marijuana possession despite \nresearch showing equivalent marijuana use; such arrests increased substantially in recent years in \nNew York City due to stop and frisk police tactics. \n88.  The bottom line is clear: more people have criminal records than ever before, and \nthose people are disproportionately African-American and Latino.  In New York City, New York \nState, and the country as a whole, African Americans and Latinos are far more likely than whites \nto have a criminal record. \n89.  This means both that African Americans and Latinos are much likelier than \nwhites to be barred from housing by automatic exclusions of people with records and that the \nabsolute number of African Americans and Latinos affected is very large.   \n                                                 \n21 State of New York Dept. of Correction and Comm.

The EEOC’s analysis of the impact of blanket bans in the employment context \nfurther confirms the disparate impact described here.  The EEOC has concluded from analyzing \nnational criminal records data that blanket bans have a disparate impact on the basis of race, and \nsets forth such a presumption in its Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and \nConviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(“Enforcement Guidance”).24 \n91.  The EEOC’s conclusion applies to the disparate impact analysis here because \nblanket bans operate the same way in housing as they do in employment.  In both contexts, \napplicants are uniformly and permanently excluded, whether from housing opportunities or \nemployment.  They are excluded based solely on the fact of a prior conviction, regardless of \nwhether they pose a current risk. \nB.  Defendants’ Blanket Ban at The Sand Castle Disproportionately and \nSeverely Impacts African Americans and Latinos in New York City \n \n92.  Just like blanket bans generally, Defendants’ specific blanket ban at The Sand \nCastle has a clear disparate impact on the basis of race.  In fact, the disparate impact is even \ngreater than a blanket ban would have at a national or statewide level because at the local level \n(i.e., New York City) incarceration rates for whites and minorities are even more \ndisproportionate.  Upon information and belief, The Sand Castle attracts potential tenants from \nall over New York City.  \n93.  In addition to prohibiting residents with criminal records, The Sand Castle \npurports to require that potential tenants earn a minimum of $30,000 per year.  But a stark \ndisparate impact persists even when this purported requirement is taken into account. \n                                                 \n24 See supra note 3.  The prior version from 1990 reached the same conclusion and set forth the same presumption. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 27 of 43 PageID #: 27\n \n94.  Using data from the United States Census Bureau, Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nand Bureau of Labor Statistics, the likely racial composition of City residents who have criminal \nrecords and annual incomes near or above $30,000 can be and has been ascertained through an \nindependent analysis. \n95.  The analysis shows that 12.2% of African-American men who live in New York \nCity, and 18% of Latino men who live in the City, satisfy The Sand Castle’s income threshold \nbut are nonetheless disqualified from living at The Sand Castle because of Defendants’ blanket \nban.   \n96.  The analysis further shows that only 4.1% of white men who live in the City \nsatisfy the income threshold but are disqualified by the blanket ban. \n97.  This means that otherwise qualified African-American men are three times as \nlikely as white men to be disqualified by Defendants’ blanket ban, and that Latino men are \nnearly four and one-half times as likely to be disqualified. \n98.  These figures, if anything, understate the disparities.  Alternative statistical \nmodels indicate that the disparate impact caused by Defendants’ blanket ban may be \nsignificantly greater. \n99.  Defendants also purport to require potential tenants to have a credit score above \n600.  Because African-American and Latino City residents with incomes near or above $30,000 \nalso typically have FICO scores over 600, credit score is not independently important for this \nanalysis.25 \n100.  The racially disparate impact on African Americans and Latinos of Defendants’ \nblanket refusal to provide housing to people with criminal records is clear from these findings. \n                                                 \n25 Benjamin Levinger, Marques Benton, Stephan Meier, The Cost of Not Knowing the Score: Self-Estimated Credit \nScores and Financial Outcomes, 32 J. Fam. Econ. 566, 569 (2011).   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 28 of 43 PageID #: 28\n \n101.  Moreover, even if Defendants’ actions were viewed more narrowly as applying a \nblanket ban only against Fortune and its clients – notwithstanding Defendants’ explicit statement \nthat the policy applies to everyone – that would still clearly have a racially disparate impact.  \nBecause Fortune’s clients are over 95% African-American and Latino and any income and credit \nscore requirements are irrelevant since Fortune would be the actual renter, the disparate impact \nwould be even greater than on the general population. \nC.  Giving Individualized Consideration to Applicants’ Circumstances Is a Less \nDiscriminatory Alternative That Would Satisfy Any Concern About Safety \nat The Sand Castle \n \n102.  Defendants’ blanket ban is not necessary to achieve a legitimate \nnondiscriminatory business purpose.  While public safety may be Defendants’ rationale for \nautomatically excluding Fortune’s clients and all others with criminal records from housing, \nblanket bans are not necessary to satisfy that concern.  Giving individualized consideration to \neach potential Sand Castle resident’s circumstances is a less discriminatory alternative to \nDefendants’ blanket ban and would serve public safety equally well. \n103.  Specifically, public safety at The Sand Castle can be protected through the use of \nindividual assessments that consider the nature of an individual’s conviction, the amount of time \nsince the conviction or release, and evidence of rehabilitation, among other factors.  An \nindividualized assessment allows people who have a criminal record, but who pose no realistic \ncurrent or future threat to the community, to obtain housing.  This more targeted and narrower \napproach both protects public safety and is less discriminatory and exclusionary because it \nreduces the number of minority applicants who are banned from The Sand Castle. \n104.  In the analogous employment context, the EEOC recognizes that individualized \nassessments are almost always required by law because they provide a less discriminatory \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 29 of 43 PageID #: 29\n \nalternative to blanket bans and are sufficient to protect legitimate interests like safety.  The \nagency’s Enforcement Guidance advocates the use of  “a targeted screen considering at least the \nnature of the crime, the time elapsed, and the nature of the job,” “notice to the individual that he \nhas been screened out because of a criminal conviction; an opportunity for the individual to \ndemonstrate that the exclusion should not be applied due to his particular circumstances; and \nconsideration by the employer as to whether the additional information provided by the \nindividual warrants an exception to the exclusion and shows that the policy as applied is not job \nrelated and consistent with business necessity.”26 \n105.  The EEOC’s sound rationale applies equally to housing, including housing at The \nSand Castle.   \n106.  A federal court of appeals has also recognized that blanket bans violate anti-\ndiscrimination laws (specifically, in the context of employment) because their disparate impact \ncannot be justified by a business necessity such as safety.  See Green v. Missouri Pacific \nRailroad, 523 F.2d 1290, 1293 (8th Cir. 1975).  Green held that a company policy automatically \nrejecting all applicants with a conviction for an offense other than a minor traffic infraction \ncaused a disparate impact based on race and could not be justified by business necessity.  The \nEighth Circuit noted that it “could not conceive of any business necessity that would \nautomatically place every individual convicted of any offense, except a minor traffic offense, in \nthe permanent ranks of the unemployed.”  Id. at 1298.   \n107.  Recent correspondence from HUD suggests it agrees that blanket bans in housing \nare not necessary to achieve a legitimate interest and constitute unlawful discrimination on the \nbasis of race.   \n                                                 \n26 See supra note 3.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 30 of 43 PageID #: 30\n \n108.  In a 2011 letter to public housing authorities across the country, the HUD \nSecretary and the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing emphasized the importance \nof “helping ex-offenders gain access to one of the most fundamental building blocks of a stable \nlife—a place to live.”  The letter makes clear that beyond the very limited, categorical exclusion \nof individuals who were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine on the premises of \nfederally assisted housing and sex offenders who are subject to a lifetime registration \nrequirement, public housing authorities enjoy “broad discretion” to “consider all relevant \ninformation, including factors which indicate a reasonable probability of favorable future \nconduct.”  Further, the letter provides that public housing authorities “should take into \nconsideration,” for example, evidence of rehabilitation and participation in counseling programs. \n109.  In making 46,000 drug offenders eligible to apply for early release from prison, \nthe United States Sentencing Commission unanimously concluded that individual assessments of \neach prisoner will suffice to protect public safety.  Specifically, judges will consider a range of \nfactors when evaluating each early-release application, including the nature and circumstances of \nthe offense, the offender’s characteristics, deterrence, and the offender’s potential threat to \nsociety.27  The Commission emphasized that this “measured approach” will “protect public \nsafety by enabling appropriate consideration of individual petitions by judges.”28  The \nCommission thus has endorsed individualized assessments, rather than blanket judgments about \nthose with criminal records, as sufficient for the protection of public safety. \n                                                 \n27 U.S. Sentencing Comm., Frequently Asked Questions: Retroactive Application of the 2014 Drug Guidelines \nAmendment 2, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/materials-on-2014-drug-guidelines-\namendment/20140724_FAQ.pdf. \n \n28 U.S. Sentencing Comm., News Release: United States Sentencing Commission, U.S. Sentencing Commission \nUnanimously Votes to Allow Delayed Retroactive Reduction in Drug Trafficking Sentences (July 18, 2014), \nhttp://www.ussc.gov/news/press-releases-and-news-advisories/press-releases-and-news-advisories-archives. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 31 of 43 PageID #: 31\n \n110.  That several Fortune clients have lived at The Sand Castle successfully and \nwithout incident further undermines any suggestion that Defendants’ policy is necessary to serve \npublic safety.  Yet those clients would have been excluded from living at The Sand Castle had \nFortune tried to lease units for them in or after the summer of 2013 when Defendants were aware \nthat Fortune’s clients have criminal histories. \n111.  Indeed, under Defendants’ current policy, even formerly incarcerated individuals \nwith exemplary post-incarceration achievements are excluded.  For example, former Fortune \nclient Stanley Richards, released from prison more than 20 years ago, is Fortune’s Senior Vice \nPresident.  Hired as a counselor at Fortune in 1991, Mr. Richards steadily worked his way up, \nbecoming manager of career development and deputy executive director.  He currently oversees \nall of Fortune’s housing programs and has developed a wide range of skills and experience in \nimplementing supportive reentry programs for people released from prison.  Mr. Richards’ work \nand achievements have been recognized by the White House and the Department of Labor.  \nAnother former Fortune client, The Honorable Walter Strauss, became a Manhattan Housing \nCourt judge after serving two prison sentences for non-violent crimes.  Prior to taking the bench, \nJudge Strauss obtained his GED through a prison education program, attended the City \nUniversity of New York at night for his bachelor’s degree, and attended Rutgers University Law \nSchool.  Both Mr. Richards and Judge Strauss are examples of individuals who changed their \nlives for the better after incarceration, establishing careers and collecting professional accolades.  \nLike many other Fortune clients who have led successful, crime-free lives post incarceration, \nneither pose any threat whatsoever to public safety.  Even so, neither Mr. Richards nor Judge \nStrauss would be welcome at The Sand Castle.    \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 32 of 43 PageID #: 32\n \n112.  It would not compromise any legitimate concern Defendants may have to give \nindividualized consideration to Fortune’s clients’ particular circumstances and allow those who \ndo not threaten public safety to live at The Sand Castle.  Defendants’ blanket criminal record ban \nat The Sand Castle nonetheless prevents any individualized consideration.  Defendants’ policy of \nautomatically excluding people with criminal records, including people like Fortune’s clients \nwho are successfully and commendably reintegrating into society, is not necessary to achieve a \nlegitimate business purpose.   \n113.  Because Defendants’ blanket ban has a large discriminatory impact on the basis of \nrace and is not necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose, it is unlawfully \ndiscriminatory. \n114.  Had Defendants enforced any lawful and appropriate nondiscriminatory policy \nregarding the consideration of criminal records, including performing in good faith an \nindividualized assessment, they would have had no valid basis to deny housing at The Sand \nCastle to most of Fortune’s clients.  Moreover, if Defendants implement a lawful policy, they \nwill have no valid basis to deny housing at The Sand Castle to most of Fortune’s clients in the \nfuture. \n115.  The discriminatory disparate impact of Defendants’ blanket ban is so large and \nforeseeable – and its overbreadth so unnecessary – that Defendants’ intent to discriminate against \nAfrican Americans and Latinos can be inferred.  Fortune contends that Defendants fully \nunderstand the unnecessary disparate impact that the blanket ban has on African-American and \nLatino applicants as well as the effect that such a policy has on the racial make-up of The Sand \nCastle.  Defendants nonetheless intentionally implemented and continue to pursue that policy for \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 33 of 43 PageID #: 33\n \nthe express purpose of decreasing or at least limiting the number of persons of color at the \nproperty.     \nIII.  DEFENDANTS’ BLANKET BAN AND OTHERS LIKE IT PREVENT \nFORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FROM OBTAINING \nCRITICALLY IMPORTANT SAFE AND STABLE HOUSING \n \n116.  The harm inflicted by discriminatory blanket bans is great not only in terms of the \nsheer number of people affected, as shown above, but also in terms of the devastating \nconsequences for each affected individual trying to reenter society.  Preventing this harm, or at \nthe very least minimizing it, is central to Fortune’s mission. \n117.  Individuals reentering society after time in prison confront an array of challenges.  \nThese include finding employment, securing government benefits, and reestablishing community \nties.  But their most immediate need is to secure safe and affordable housing.  Especially in a \nplace like New York City, where housing is extremely expensive, that is very difficult. \n118.  Research shows that success in finding adequate housing, though difficult, is \ncritically important to meeting the other challenges faced by reentrants.  Housing has been \ncharacterized, properly, as the “lynchpin that holds the reintegration process together.”29   \n119.  A 2004 New York City study demonstrated that more than 30% of single adults \nentering shelters under the Department of Homeless Services have recently been released from \ncity and state correctional institutions.  Without stable housing, many continually cycle between \nincarceration and shelters.30  \n                                                 \n29 See supra note 5.   \n \n30 NYC Department of Homeless Services, Summary of DOC/DHS Data Match (Jan. 22, 2004) (draft analysis \nsubmitted for review as part of the New York City Dept. of Correction and Dept. of Homeless Services Discharge \nPlanning Initiative). \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 34 of 43 PageID #: 34\n \n120.  Other research has shown that reentrants who do not find stable housing in the \ncommunity are more likely to recidivate than those who are able to secure permanent housing.       \n121.  An Urban Institute study likewise found a causal connection between the inability \nto find permanent housing and recidivism.  According to the study, reentrants often did not \nsucceed in the community if they could not find a safe and stable place to live.31 \n122.  The Vera Institute of Justice found that parolees released from incarceration who \nentered New York City homeless shelters were seven times more likely to abscond from post-\nrelease supervision than those with more stable housing.  It also found that reentrants in \ntemporary shelter housing had more difficulty resisting drugs and finding work.32   \n123.  This and other evidence makes plain that adequate housing is crucial to success in \nthe reintegration process.  Yet blanket bans directly prevent reentrants from obtaining such \nhousing.  By design, blanket bans do so thoughtlessly, without giving any consideration to the \nparticular circumstances of a person trying to find a place to live.  This complete disregard for \nindividual circumstances cannot be justified under the law, and needlessly inflicts great harm on \nthe formerly incarcerated, their communities, and organizations like Fortune seeking to help \nthem become productive members of society. \nINJURY TO THE FORTUNE SOCIETY \n124.  Fortune has been directly and substantially harmed by the blanket ban against \nproviding housing to formerly incarcerated individuals and others with criminal records that \nDefendants have maintained since at least the summer of 2013.  Defendants’ policy has \ndiminished Fortune’s ability to perform its work, forced it to divert resources, and frustrated its \n                                                 \n31 Jeremy Travis and Caterina G. Roman, Urban Inst., Taking Stock: Housing, Homelessness, and Prisoner Reentry  \n7-10 (2004), http://www.urban.org/publications/411096.html.  \n \n32 Id. at 8.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 35 of 43 PageID #: 35\n \nmission of ensuring that formerly incarcerated people can successfully reenter society and obtain \nsafe and stable housing.  \n125.  Defendants’ policy placed Fortune at significant risk of losing grant funding and \ncaused unnecessary costs and delay related to the grant process.  As described in paragraph 54 \nabove, Fortune received a grant from the State of New York to obtain 25 rental units in Queens \nfor reentrants.  Defendants’ denial of housing delayed Fortune’s ability to meet the terms of the \ngrant and thereby put Fortune at risk of losing the grant altogether.  Ultimately, in order to fulfill \nits obligation, Fortune had to hire an additional staff member to search for and secure appropriate \nunits in other Queens apartment buildings.  After Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, it took \nFortune additional months to obtain the 25 units necessary to satisfy the grant’s terms.   \n126.  Further, Fortune devoted substantial time and other resources to identify The Sand \nCastle as appropriate housing for its clients.  Defendants’ discriminatory criminal records policy, \nhowever, prevented Fortune from placing clients there.  As a result, Fortune has been forced to \nexpend scarce and substantial additional resources to find adequate alternative housing options \nfor clients who otherwise would have been placed at The Sand Castle.  In addition to additional \nstaff time, Fortune has spent a significant amount of money in broker fees because it has had to \nemploy brokers and agents to assist it with finding housing for its clients in Queens.   \n127.  Defendants’ actions also impeded Fortune’s programs in another way.  When \nFortune is able to place multiple clients in one geographic area, it reduces travel time and costs \nfor Fortune’s caseworkers.  This is because rather than spending time traveling to several \ndifferent buildings in different neighborhoods for just a few meetings, in the same time period, a \ncaseworker can visit with multiple clients living at the same site.  Defendants’ refusal to allow \nFortune clients as tenants, and Fortune’s corresponding need to place clients at multiple sites \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 36 of 43 PageID #: 36\n \nspread throughout Queens, has increased both the temporal and financial cost of individual \ncaseworker visits.    \n128.  Defendants’ discriminatory conduct has also directly impeded Fortune’s ability to \noperate its housing programs and frustrated its mission by disrupting its housing pipeline.  As \ndescribed above, many of Fortune’s clients progress from temporary to phased-permanent to \npermanent housing.  By impeding Fortune’s ability to place its clients at The Sand Castle, \nDefendants have reduced the effectiveness of this model.  Specifically, Defendants’ \ndiscriminatory refusal caused Fortune clients otherwise eligible to live in The Sand Castle to \nremain in the Fortune Academy’s temporary housing.  Because these clients remained at the \nAcademy, fewer beds were available to other individuals newly released from prison and in need \nof immediate assistance.  But for Defendants’ discriminatory actions, Fortune staff would have \nbeen able to devote more time to locating housing for clients currently in its emergency and \nphased-permanent housing and Fortune would have been able to meet the needs of more clients. \n129.  Moreover, as a direct result of Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, Fortune has \nhad to divert resources to engage in advocacy, community education, and outreach about the \nneed to increase the availability of housing for formerly incarcerated individuals.  Fortune has \nbeen forced to allocate limited staff time and resources to both investigate and counteract \nDefendants’ discriminatory conduct.  As a result, Fortune has had to forgo other programmatic \nactivities it would have engaged in. \n130.  Unless enjoined, Defendants will continue to engage in the unlawful practices \ndescribed herein and the extent of Fortune’s injuries will increase. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-BMC   Document 1   Filed 10/30/14   Page 37 of 43 PageID #: 37\n \n131.

INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 517, to address the application of disparate-impact liability under the Fair Housing Act \n(“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), (b), in challenges to tenant-screening policies that ban persons \nwho have criminal convictions.  The United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the \nUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) share enforcement \nauthority under the FHA.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3610; 3612(a), (b), (o); 3613(e); 3614.  Additionally, \nthe DOJ and its federal partners have taken steps in recent years to help formerly incarcerated \nindividuals return to their communities.  In 2011, DOJ convened the Federal Interagency Reentry \nCouncil to discuss and implement strategies to remove barriers to successful reentry of formerly \nincarcerated individuals so that they can compete for jobs, attain stable housing, support their \nchildren and families, and contribute to their communities.1  As part of these efforts, HUD \nreleased guidance concerning how the FHA applies to the use of criminal records by providers or \noperators of housing and real-estate related transactions.  See HUD, Office of Gen. Counsel \nGuidance on Application of Fair Hous. Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by \nProviders of Hous. & Real Estate-Related Transactions (Apr. 4, 2016) (“HUD Guidance”), \n                                                            \n1 See DOJ, Roadmap to Reentry: Reducing Recidivism Through Improved Reentry Outcomes at \nthe Fed.

BACKGROUND \nA.  Barriers to Housing for Individuals with Criminal Records \n \nEach year in America, more than 600,000 citizens are released from federal and state \nprisons, and 11.4 million individuals are released from local jails.3  Upon release, these \nindividuals face the potential “experience [of] the ‘civil death’ of discrimination by employers, \nlandlords, and whoever else conducts a background check.”  Utah v. Strieff, 136 S. Ct. 2056, \n2070 (2016) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); see also Doe v. United States, __ F.3d __, 2016 WL \n4245425, at *5 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2016) (observing “the unfortunate lifelong toll that . . . \nconvictions often impose on low-level criminal offenders” including the inability to obtain rental \nhousing).  One of the greatest potential barriers to successful reentry for those released from \nincarceration relates to housing, as “[s]table housing is particularly critical for people returning \nfrom prison and jail, who face a myriad of challenges while reestablishing themselves in their \n                                                            \n2 Previously, HUD had issued guidance directed at the use of arrest records in housing decisions \nby public housing agencies and owners of federally-assisted housing.  See HUD, Office of Pub. \n& Indian Hous., Guidance for Public Hous. Agencies (PHAs) and Owners of Federally-Assisted \nHous. on Excluding the Use of Arrest Records in Hous. Decisions (Nov. 2, 2015), available at \nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=PIH2015-19.pdf. \n \n3 See Roadmap to Reentry: Reducing Recidivism Through Improved Reentry Outcomes at the \nFed.

The Sandcastle’s Use of Criminal Records in its Application Process \n \nThe Sandcastle is an affordable rental apartment complex with 917 units in Far \nRockaway, Queens.  Plaintiff filed suit in October 2014, alleging among other things that the \nSandcastle has a policy of categorically excluding applicants who have felony or non-traffic \nmisdemeanor convictions from tenancy, which causes an unjustified disparate impact on \nAfrican-American and Hispanic applicants in violation of FHA.  After discovery, both parties \nmoved for summary judgment on this disparate-impact claim. \nPlaintiff has presented evidence that Sandcastle publicized its policy of excluding tenants \nwith criminal convictions, including through online advertisements and dozens of e-mail \nresponses to prospective applicants stating that applicants must have “no criminal history” or “no \ncriminal background” to be approved.  Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 94-1) at \n10-11.  The advertisements and e-mails that plaintiff introduced did not specify any exceptions to \nthe “no criminal history” policy.  Id.  Plaintiff also analyzed the Sandcastle’s accepted \n                                                            \n4 The Federal Interagency Reentry Council: A Record of Progress and a Roadmap for the Future, \nsupra note 1, at 49. \n \n5 Exec.

Pl. Opp’n to Defs. Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 98) at 7. \nDefendants dispute that they employ a categorical ban.  Defs. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for \nSumm. J. (Doc. 97-1) at 12.  They respond that there are examples of tenants who have criminal \nconvictions living at the property and that defendants’ employees state that they sometimes \naccepted applicants with non-serious misdemeanor convictions.  Id. at 15-16, 19-22.  Defendants \njustify what they say is their policy of conducting a case-by-case analysis of criminal records by \ninvoking a duty to secure the rental premises and provide for the safety of their tenants.  Id. at \n31-32; Defs. Opp’n to Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 95) at 11, 29-30.   \nDefendants have retained 1,145 application files for individuals they accepted as tenants \nbetween 2006 and June 2015.  Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 94-1) at 11.  \nDefendants admit that Sandcastle does not systematically retain records related to applicants who \nhave been denied.  Defs. Resp. to Pl. R. 56.1 Statement (Doc. 95-1) ¶134.  The experts for both \nplaintiff and defendants agree that no meaningful statistical analysis can be done with respect to \nthe denied applications because not all denied applications were retained, and there is no way to \ndetermine whether those that were kept amount to a representative sample of denied applicants.  \nParnell Suppl. Report (Doc. 94-10 Ex. 24) at 4-5; Welsch Suppl. Report (Doc. 101-5 Ex. KK) at \n2. \nPlaintiff retained Dr. Christopher Wildeman to provide expert testimony about \ndemographic analysis and incarceration risk rates.  Based on reported periods of incarceration for \nparticipants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (“NLSY79”), Dr. Wildeman \ncalculated incarceration risk rates for non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and Hispanics \nbroken down by income bands.  Wildeman Report (Doc. 94-12 Ex. 27) at 8-9 & tbl. A1.  For \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 11 of 25 PageID #: 7955\nexample, Dr. Wildeman found that the incarceration risk rate within the $30,000 to $70,000 \nincome band is 1.37% for non-Hispanic whites, 4.76% for African Americans, and 3.00% for \nHispanics.  Id. at tbl. A1.  According to plaintiff, this income band aligns with the population \neligible to rent under Sandcastle’s affordable rental programs.  Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for \nSumm. J. (Doc. 94-1) at 19.  Dr. Wildeman also explained why NLSY79 is an appropriate data \nset to use to measure incarceration risk rates and why incarceration risk rates are an appropriate \nproxy for likelihood of a conviction history.  Wildeman Report (Doc. 94-12 Ex. 27) at 2, 5-6.  In \naddition to the analysis of the NLSY79 data, Dr. Wildeman calculated incarceration risk rates for \nnon-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and Hispanics from various sources that provide data \nabout incarceration in New York State.  Id. at 7-9, 11-12 & tbl. 2.  Based on these two sets of \nincarceration risk rates, he determined that “the disproportionalities reported at the national level, \nat all income levels, can be expected to be significantly greater at the New York State and [New \nYork] City level.”  Wildeman Declaration (Doc. 94-7 Ex. 21) ¶14.  Plaintiff’s statistical expert, \nDr. Allan Parnell, determined that the disparities in incarceration risks rates for the income bands \nrelevant to the Sandcastle, if applied to various housing markets relevant to the Sandcastle, result \nin statistically significant disparities in who is excluded by a ban of tenants with felony or non-\ntraffic misdemeanor convictions.  Parnell Report (Doc. 94-9 Ex. 23) at 10. \nDefendants argue that these analyses are not relevant.  Instead, they argue that the proper \ncomparators are the tenants currently in the complex, which defendants say is close to 70% \nAfrican American and Hispanic.  Defs. Opp’n to Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 95) at 18, 20.   \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nAlthough the FHA does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants’ \ncriminal records, it does require that providers do so in a way to avoid overbroad generalizations \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 12 of 25 PageID #: 7956\nthat disproportionately disqualify people based on a characteristic protected by the statute, such \nas race or national origin.  To that end, the FHA bars criminal records bans that have a disparate \nimpact on applicants based on race or national origin unless they are supported by a legally \nsufficient justification.  Analysis of the lawfulness of such bans proceeds according to the three-\nstep framework that HUD has established to evaluate discriminatory effects liability under the \nFHA.  At the first step, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing \nthat a ban on tenants with criminal records causes a disparate impact based on race or national \norigin.  Once a plaintiff challenging such a ban introduces reliable evidence proving a prima \nfacie case, the burden shifts to the housing provider to prove with evidence – and not just by \ninvoking generalized concerns about safety – that the ban is necessary to actually accomplish the \nprovider’s substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest.  Even if this showing is made, the \nban will nevertheless be unlawful if a plaintiff proves a less discriminatory alternative, such as \nthat an individualized review of applicants’ criminal records could serve the defendant’s needs.   \nA.  Challenges to the Discriminatory Effects of Bans on Criminal Records Are \nEvaluated Based on the FHA’s Three-Step Framework \n \nDisparate impact claims under the FHA are evaluated based on the burden-shifting \nframework set out at 24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  MHANY Mgmt., Inc. v. Cty. of Nassau, 819 F.3d 581, \n619 (2d Cir. 2016).7  At the first step of that regulation’s burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff \nbears the burden of establishing a prima face case by proving that the “challenged practice \ncaused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect” on a protected class.  24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.500(c)(1).  Making such a showing “is a fact-specific inquiry.”  HUD, Implementation of \n                                                            \n7 The HUD regulation is consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Texas Department of \nHousing & Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507 (2015), \nwhich confirmed the availability of disparate-impact liability under the FHA and discussed \nlimiting principles for such claims.  See MHANY Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 618 (“The Supreme Court \nimplicitly adopted HUD’s approach . . . .”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 13 of 25 PageID #: 7957\nthe Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11,460, 11,468 (Feb. 15, \n2013).  “No single test controls in measuring disparate impact, but the [plaintiff] must offer proof \nof disproportionate impact, measured in a plausible way.”  Mt. Holly Gardens Citizen in Action, \nInc. v. Twp. of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d 375, 382 (3d Cir. 2011) (alteration and internal quotation \nmarks omitted), cert. dismissed, 134 S. Ct. 636 (2013).8   \nIf the plaintiff proves its prima facie case, the regulation specifies that the practice may \nstill be lawful if there is a “legally sufficient justification” for it.  24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  A legally \nsufficient justification can be established if, at step two, the defendant meets its “burden of \nproving that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more [of its] substantial, \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory interests,” id. § 100.500(c)(2), and the plaintiff fails to prove, at \nstep three, that the interests “could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory \neffect,” id. § 100.500(c)(3). \nWith one exception, this framework applies to evaluating whether housing providers’ \npolicies that consider criminal records in an application process produce unlawful discriminatory \neffects.9  The FHA does not impose disparate-impact liability for policies that deny housing \nbecause a person is “convicted . . . of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled \nsubstance.”  42 U.S.C. § 3607(b)(4); see also Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive \nCmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2520-21 (2015) (holding that this provision is a defense to \ndisparate-impact liability).  All other criminal records bans must comply with the disparate \n                                                            \n8 When consistent with the regulation, preexisting FHA case law and legal sources analyzing \ndisparate impact claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) \nremain relevant to evaluating FHA disparate impact claims.  See MHANY Mgmt., 819 F.3d at \n618-19; see also Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2522-23 (relying upon interpretations of Title \nVII to interpret the FHA). \n \n9 Such bans may also be subject to intentional discrimination liability.  See HUD Guidance at 8-\n10. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 14 of 25 PageID #: 7958\nimpact standards of the FHA.  The fact that Congress created an exemption to disparate-impact \nliability only for convictions for certain drug offenses supports the availability of disparate \nimpact challenges to housing providers’ exclusions of tenants who were convicted of other types \nof offenses.  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates \ncertain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the \nabsence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28 \n(2001). \nConsistent with the above discussion, HUD issued Guidance in April 2016 on the \napplication of FHA standards to the use of criminal records by housing providers.  See HUD \nGuidance, supra, p. 2.  The Guidance specifies that the standard three-step framework applies to \nclaims that a housing provider’s consideration of criminal records has a discriminatory effect \nviolating the FHA.  The Guidance also provides detail about how the analysis proceeds at each \nstep. \nB.  Blanket Bans on Tenants with Criminal Records May Have a Disparate Impact \n \nBlanket bans on tenants with criminal records – i.e., categorical prohibitions that do not \nconsider “when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the \nconvicted person has done since then,” HUD Guidance at 6 – run a substantial risk of having a \ndisparate impact based on race or national origin.  African-American and Hispanic individuals, \nand African-American and Hispanic men in particular, make up a disproportionate number of \nindividuals with arrest and convictions records in the United States.10   \n                                                            \n10 See, e.g., Exec. Office of the President, Econ.

W. Haven Fire Dep’t, 352 F.3d 565, 575 (2d Cir. 2003), superseded on other \ngrounds as recognized by MHANY Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 619.  To establish a discriminatory effect \nat the first step of the disparate impact analysis, a comparison of the two groups must reveal that \nthe tenant-screening policy “actually or predictably results in a disparate impact” on a protected \ngroup of individuals.  24 C.F.R. § 100.500(a); see also Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 575.  Such \ncomparisons will normally be based on statistical evidence.  See Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 575-\n76.  A plaintiff can thus establish a prima facie case by introducing reliable statistical analyses \nproving that a ban on tenants with criminal records will predictably have a disproportionate \nadverse effect on members of a protected group compared to other individuals.   \nMany of the statistics available to prove racial and ethnic disparities in criminal records11 \n– especially statistics that account for additional demographic characteristics like income12 – are \nderived from nationwide survey data.  It is not necessary for a plaintiff challenging a criminal \nrecords policy to obtain data on incarceration risk rates specific to the population that lives in a \ngeographic housing market, so long as a plaintiff provides sufficient foundation to support the \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \npolice interactions, arrests, and sentencing, even after controlling for defendant and offense \ncharacteristics.”  Id. at 29. \n \n11 In this case, plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Wildeman, explained why incarceration data is a sound way \nto measure the risk of having been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor.  Wildeman Report \n(Doc. 94-12 Ex. 27) at 5-6.  In light of the fact-specific inquiry necessary to determine whether a \nplaintiff has satisfied the prima facie case, this Court need only find that plaintiff’s method was \nat least one valid option for proving racial disparities in criminal records. \n \n12 Outside the context of challenges to criminal records policies, courts evaluating FHA disparate \nimpact challenges related to affordable housing have sometimes sought disparity data specific to \n“the relevant income pool” of prospective tenants.  See, e.g., Artisan/Am. Corp. v. City of Alvin, \n588 F.3d 291, 298 (5th Cir. 2009). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 16 of 25 PageID #: 7960\nreliance on national data for the disparities present in the geography relevant to its case.13  See \nDothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330 (1977) (approving, in a Title VII disparate impact case, \n“reliance on general population demographic data . . . where there was no reason to suppose” \nthat the relevant demographic data for the geography at issue “differ markedly from those of the \nnational population”); Brown v. Omaha Hous. Auth., No. 8:05-cv-423, 2007 WL 2123750, at *2 \n(D. Neb. July 20, 2007) (noting the possible permissible use of national statistics in an FHA \ndisparate impact challenge to a policy denying government housing assistance vouchers to \nindividuals with criminal backgrounds); HUD Guidance at 3-4.14   \nWhen complete data for the actual applicants processed according to the policy is not \navailable, or when potential applicants may have been discouraged by the policy, measuring a \nscreening policy’s impact may appropriately be based on all individuals in the housing market \nserved by the complex at issue.  See R.I. Comm’n for Human Rights v. Graul, 120 F. Supp. 3d \n110, 125-26 (D.R.I. 2015) (using statewide census data to evaluate a disparate impact challenge \nto a landlord’s policy rejecting applicants seeking to house more than two persons per bedroom); \nGashi v. Grubb & Ellis Prop. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 801 F. Supp. 2d 12, 16-17 (D. Conn. 2011) \n(using citywide census data to evaluate a disparate impact challenge to a condominium \nassociation’s policy rejecting applicants seeking to house more than two persons per bedroom); \n                                                            \n13 In this case, Dr. Wildeman explained why the incarceration risk rates that account for income, \nwhich he calculated based on the NLSY79’s national sample, is representative of disparities \nfound in New York State and New York City.  Wildeman Declaration (Doc. 94-7 Ex. 21) ¶14; \nWildeman Report (Doc. 94-12 Ex. 27) at 2, 11. \n \n14 In contrast, courts have not always accepted the use of national statistics by FHA plaintiffs \nwho do not provide evidence affirmatively justifying the national statistics’ relevance to a more \nlocalized housing market.  See, e.g., Mountain Side Mobile Estates P’ship v. Sec’y of HUD, 56 \nF.3d 1243, 1253 (10th Cir. 1995); see also id. at 1257-58 (Henry, J., dissenting) (noting the \nrecord lacked evidence “conclusively showing” that the local market differed from the national \nstatistics). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 17 of 25 PageID #: 7961\nsee also Easterling v. Connecticut, 783 F. Supp. 2d 323, 333-34 (D. Conn. 2011) (“The eligible \nlabor pool may also be used in lieu of the actual applicant pool if lack of information as to an \napplicant pool would render it impossible to establish a prima facie disparate impact.”) (internal \nalterations and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Malave v. Potter, 320 F.3d 321, 327 (2d Cir. \n2003)).  Accordingly, when only incomplete records exist of actual applicants to a complex, or a \ncomplex advertised its use of a criminal background check thereby discouraging people with \ncriminal records from applying (as plaintiff alleges here),15 it is appropriate to evaluate the \ndisparities caused by the policy by reference to its impact on the relevant housing market served \nby the complex rather than by analyzing the actual applicant pool.  See Dothard, 433 U.S. at 330 \n(“There is no requirement . . . that a statistical showing of disproportionate impact must always \nbe based on analysis of the characteristics of actual applicants.”); EEOC v. Joint Apprenticeship \nComm. of Joint Indus. Bd. of Elec. Indus., 186 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 1998). \nAlthough the United States takes no position on whether there are sufficient undisputed \nfacts necessary to prove plaintiff’s prima facie case at the summary judgment stage of this case, \nwe note that defendants have put forward several specious arguments in challenging plaintiff’s \nsatisfaction of the prima facie case.  First, defendants wrongly rely on an analysis about the \ndemographics of the tenants currently in the complex.  See Defs. Opp’n to Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. \n(Doc. 95) at 18, 20.  Contrary to defendants’ argument, the claim that the complex at issue \ncurrently has a predominately African-American and Hispanic population does not preclude \nplaintiff from establishing a prima facie case.  It is blackletter law under both Title VII and the \nFHA that the absence of racial disparities in the final results of a multi-step process – at the \n                                                            \n15 In this case, both plaintiff’s expert and defendants’ expert agree that the incomplete data on \ndenied applicants precludes meaningful statistical analyses of the applicant pool.  Parnell Suppl. \nReport (Doc. 94-10 Ex. 24) at 4-5; Welsch Suppl. Report (Doc. 101-5 Ex. KK) at 2. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 18 of 25 PageID #: 7962\nbottom line – does not excuse discrimination at a particular step of the process.  See Connecticut \nv. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 456 (1982); Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736 F.2d 983, 987-88 (4th Cir. \n1984).  A criminal records policy that disproportionately disqualifies African Americans and \nHispanics from the opportunity to advance in the residency screening process is discriminatory \nin the absence of a legally sufficient justification.  See Teal, 457 U.S. at 451 (“The suggestion \nthat disparate impact should be measured only at the bottom line ignores the fact that Title VII \nguarantees these individual respondents the opportunity to compete equally with white workers \non the basis of job-related criteria.”).  Based on just such reasoning, a federal district court \nrecently rejected an attempt to defend against an FHA disparate impact challenge to a criminal \nrecords policy based on the fact that the tenants at the complexes at issue were predominately \n(and, in one case, exclusively) African-American.  See Alexander v. Edgewood Mgmt. Corp., No. \n1:15-cv-1140-RCL, 2016 WL 5957673, at *3 (D.D.C. July 25, 2016). \nSecond, defendants wrongly state that plaintiff needs to demonstrate that defendants \napplied their criminal records ban in every instance in order to prove a blanket ban.  See, e.g., \nDefs. Opp’n to Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 95) at 8 (“The presence of tenants with felonies and \nmisdemeanors proves that a blanket ban does not exist . . . .”)  But even setting aside the \nevidence that defendants described their policy in categorical terms in advertisements and \ncommunications with applicants, evidence that a defendant did not always apply its policy of \nexcluding tenants with certain criminal records does not refute the existence of the policy.16  \nEstablishing the existence of a discriminatory policy does not require showing that none of the \n                                                            \n16 The existence of a policy is also not refuted by it being informal or unwritten.  See, e.g., \nBischoff v. Brittain, No. 2:14-1970, 2014 WL 5106991, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2014) \n(unwritten policy); Fair Hous. Cong. v. Weber, 993 F. Supp. 1286, 1293 (C.D. Cal. 1997) \n(informal policy); Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard Cty., 911 F. Supp. 918, 939 (D. Md. 1996) \n(custom as policy), aff’d, 124 F.3d 597 (4th Cir. 1997).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 19 of 25 PageID #: 7963\nindividuals living at the property has a criminal record.  See United States v. Garden Homes \nMgmt., Corp., 156 F. Supp. 2d 413, 423 (D.N.J. 2001) (holding, for a claim brought under the \nAttorney General’s authority to take action against a “pattern or practice” of discrimination \nviolating the FHA, that “a defendant might on occasion make exceptions to its discriminatory \nnorm, but that such exceptions do not bar liability”).  Even the most stringent ban may permit \noccasional exceptions.  For example, in the Title VII context, the Eighth Circuit sustained a \ndisparate impact challenge to a policy that disqualified for employment any individual with a \ncriminal (non-traffic-related) conviction, even though the employer’s “stringent policy \noccasionally ha[d] been relaxed.”  Green v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., 523 F.2d 1290, 1293 & n.6 (8th \nCir. 1975); see also Richardson v. Hotel Corp. of Am., 332 F. Supp. 519, 520 (E.D. La. 1971) \n(noting that a categorical ban for people with criminal convictions excluded minor traffic \nviolations and that the plaintiff was hired, even though he had been convicted of two crimes \nother than minor traffic violations, as a result of “a clerical error made in processing the . . . \napplication[]”), aff’d, 468 F.2d 951 (5th Cir. 1972). \nThird, contrary to defendants’ misguided assertions, plaintiff does not impermissibly seek \nto hold defendants liable for racial disparities in the criminal justice system.  See Defs. Opp’n to \nPl. Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 95) at 13-15.  Instead, liability would be based on plaintiff proving \nthat defendants themselves imposed a policy of considering criminal records in a non-\nindividualized manner and that the policy had an unjustified discriminatory impact on African \nAmericans and Hispanics.  It is common that the disparities underlying policies found to have a \ndisparate impact are rooted in past discriminatory practices.  See Inclusive Cmyts., 135 S. Ct. at \n2515-16 (summarizing twentieth century practices that gave rise to segregated housing patterns \nand explaining that “[d]e jure residential segregation by race was declared unconstitutional \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 20 of 25 PageID #: 7964\nalmost a century ago, but its vestiges remain today, intertwined with the country’s economic and \nsocial life”) (citation omitted).  For example, the Supreme Court first recognized disparate-\nimpact liability in a case that held an employer responsible for the disparate impact of its policy \nrequiring applicants to have a high school diploma.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. \n424, 431-32 (1971).  The Court explicitly recognized that the reason for such a policy having a \ndiscriminatory effect was the inferior segregated schooling historically provided by the State of \nNorth Carolina to African Americans, see id. at 430, but that did not immunize the employer \nfrom liability for its own decision to impose the diploma requirement. \nC.  Blanket Bans on Tenants with Criminal Records Cannot be Justified by \nGeneralizations about Safety and Security \n \nOnce a plaintiff establishes that a challenged policy predictably will result in a disparate \nimpact, a defendant must prove its policy “is necessary to achieve one or more of its substantial, \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory interests.”  See 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(2).  The defendant’s claim \nof necessity “must be supported by evidence and may not be hypothetical or speculative.”  Id. \n§ 100.500(b)(2); see MHANY Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 617 (noting that the defendant must “prove that \nits actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest”) \n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts of appeals addressing \ndisparate impact challenges to the use of criminal background checks in the employment context \nhave held that Title VII requires demonstrable proof to support a defendant’s justification.  See \nEl v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 479 F.3d 232, 244 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Dothard, 433 U.S. at 334); \nGreen, 523 F.2d at 1296.  In light of this legal authority, defendants are flatly wrong to claim that \nthey face only a burden of production – not proof – at this step.  See Defs. Opp’n to Pl. Mot. for \nSumm. J. (Doc. 95) at 30.     \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 21 of 25 PageID #: 7965\nWhile the FHA does not require individualized assessment of housing applicants’ \ncriminal history in all circumstances, “[a] housing provider that imposes a blanket prohibition on \nany person with any conviction record – no matter when the conviction occurred, what the \nunderlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then – will be unable to \nmeet [its] burden” of proving necessity.  HUD Guidance at 6.  Defendants thus correctly \n“concede that a blanket ban would not be narrowly tailored to balance the safety of the building \nand other tenants with the rights of a potential applicant.”  Defs. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for \nSumm. J. (Doc. 97-1) at 32.  The Eighth Circuit’s decision in Green illustrates well why a \ndefendant generally will be unable to prove the necessity of a blanket ban.  Green considered a \nTitle VII challenge to an employer’s policy of refusing to hire individuals with a criminal \nconviction other than a minor traffic offense.  See 523 F.2d at 1292.  After determining that the \nplaintiffs had established a prima facie statistical case of discrimination, see id. at 1293-95, \nGreen held such a “sweeping disqualification . . . resting solely on past behavior” could not meet \nthe requirements of the business necessity test without considering whether the “conduct . . . may \nbe remote in time or . . . significantly bear[s] upon the particular job requirements,” id. at 1296, \n1298.17  Green noted that, although the employer had proffered seven reasons for the policy, \nranging from fear of theft to possible impeachment as a witness, “they in no way justify an \nabsolute policy which sweeps so broadly.”  Id. at 1298.  Instead, the Eighth Circuit observed, \n“[w]e cannot conceive of any business necessity that would automatically place every individual \nconvicted of any offense, except a minor traffic offense, in the permanent ranks of the \n                                                            \n17 Title VII’s “business necessity defense” is analogous to the FHA’s “legally sufficient \njustification.”  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 11,472 (noting 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(b)(1) is “consistent with \nCongress’s 1991 enactment of legislation codifying that, in the employment context, a practice \nthat has a disparate impact must be consistent with ‘business necessity’”); see also Inclusive \nCmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2522 (observing that the legally sufficient justification “step of the [FHA] \nanalysis is analogous to the business necessity standard under Title VII”).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 22 of 25 PageID #: 7966\nunemployed.”  Id. (emphasis added); see also Field v. Orkin Extermination Co., No. 00-5913, \n2002 WL 32345739, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 21, 2002) (“[A] blanket policy of denying employment \nto any person having a criminal conviction is a violation of Title VII.”). \nAlthough maintaining safety and security at a property is an important duty for housing \nproviders, simply invoking the need to ensure “safety” or “security” cannot justify a screening \npolicy that categorically excludes any tenant who has a criminal conviction.  A ban on tenants \nwith convictions without consideration of factors like the conviction’s nature, severity, and \nrecency is over-inclusive and lacks any principled way to assess who, if anyone, poses a risk to \nsafety or security in the property.  For example, the Eighth Circuit affirmed an injunction that \nrequired an employer to consider “the nature and gravity of the offense or offenses, the time that \nhas passed since the conviction and/or completion of sentence, and the nature of the job for \nwhich the applicant has applied” if it wanted to consider an applicant’s criminal record.  Green v. \nMo. Pac. R.R. Co., 549 F.2d 1158, 1160 (8th Cir. 1977); see also Waldon v. Cincinnati Pub. \nSch., 941 F. Supp. 2d 884, 889 (S.D. Ohio 2013) (finding that, while a policy barring \nemployment for people with specified convictions is justified for “serious recent crimes” “due to \nthe nature of its employees’ proximity to children[,]” an individualized approach is still \nnecessary so as not to bar employment people who have offenses that are remote in time, \ninsubstantial, or followed by “demonstrated decades of good performance”); HUD Guidance at \n7.18 \n                                                            \n18 Studies have shown that rates of recidivism decline for older convictions.  See, e.g., Megan C. \nKurlychek et al., Scarlet Letters and Recidivism: Does an Old Criminal Record Predict Future \nOffending?, 5 Criminology & Pub. Pol’y 483 (2006) (noting rates of recidivism, even for violent \ncrime, reduce for convictions older than seven years), cited in HUD Guidance at 7 & n.34; cf. El, \n479 F.3d at 247 (“Had [plaintiff], for example, hired an expert who testified that there is time at \nwhich a former criminal is no longer any more likely to recidivate than the average person, then \nthere would be a factual question for the jury to resolve.”). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 23 of 25 PageID #: 7967\nEven if a defendant adopts a more narrowly tailored policy that prohibits renting to \ntenants with only certain types of convictions, that housing provider must still prove that the \nmore limited ban is necessary to serve its “substantial, legitimate, non-discriminatory interests.”  \n24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(2).  Merely claiming that the policy is necessary to promote safety and \nsecurity is not enough.  The housing provider must produce evidence proving the necessity of the \npolicy to achieve those interests and cannot simply rely on speculation or hypotheticals.  See id. \n§ 100.500(b)(2).   \nAssuming that the plaintiff here has established a prima facie case, defendants have not \nsatisfied that burden.  Here, without providing any evidence that would allow the Court to assess \ntheir justifications, defendants make the conclusory assertion that their criminal records policy is \n“necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of residents who already reside in the \nSandcastle.”  Defs. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 97-1) at 31 (capitalization \naltered).  Defendants further claim, without more, that their policy “serves valid business and \nsecurity functions of protecting tenants and the property from former convicted criminals.”  Id. at \n32 (quoting Defs. Answer); see also Defs. Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 95) at 11 \n(noting, in passing, “Sandcastle’s obligation to other building residents to maintain a safe \nbuilding”); id. at 29-30 (quoting their Answer for additional, conclusory, unsupported statements \nrelated to safety).  Such sweeping and unsupported assertions do not amount to proof that \ndefendants’ exclusion of tenants with criminal convictions is necessary to further their interest in \npromoting safety and security.  See MHANY Mgmt., 819 F.3d at 617.  Defendants must prove \ntheir assertions with evidence. \n   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-06410-VMS   Document 102   Filed 10/18/16   Page 24 of 25 PageID #: 7968\nD.  An Individualized Review of Tenants with Criminal Records May Provide a \nLess Discriminatory Alternative to Blanket Bans \n \nIf a defendant satisfies its burden of proving the necessity of its criminal records policy, \nthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that an alternative policy with a “less \ndiscriminatory effect” could serve the “substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests” that \nthe defendant invoked in support of its challenged practice.  24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(3).  As \nexplained above, a housing provider cannot meet its burden of proving the necessity of imposing \na blanket ban on renting to any tenant who has been convicted of any crime, regardless of its \nnature, the age of the conviction, or a person’s rehabilitation.  But even if a defendant could meet \nits burden of proof to support a prohibition of tenants with some or all types of convictions, an \nindividualized review of an applicant’s criminal record would likely provide a less \ndiscriminatory alternative method of satisfying the housing provider’s interests.  See Green, 523 \nF.2d at 1298 (noting that the justifications proffered by the employer, which did not justify a \ncategorical ban, “can serve as relevant considerations in making individual hiring decisions”).   \nAn individualized assessment of applicants’ criminal convictions might include \nconsideration of issues such as the circumstances, severity, and recency of any conviction, along \nwith the individual’s age at the time of conviction, age now, frequency of criminal convictions, \nany evidence of rehabilitation, and evidence that the individual has maintained a good tenant \nhistory before and/or after the conviction.19  See HUD Guidance at 7.  Such a review is likely to \nmore “accurately distinguish between applicants [who] pose an unacceptable level of risk and \nthose [who] do not.”  El, 479 F.3d at 245. \n                                                            \n19 An individualized review may also determine that the conviction record obtained by the \nhousing provider is wrong.
