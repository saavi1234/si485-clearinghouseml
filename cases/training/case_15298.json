The plaintiff sued the District of Columbia under <i> Bivens</i>, claiming that their actions were a violation of the Fifth Amendment due process clause. The plaintiff, represented by the D.C. Public Defender Service, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff claimed that the D.C. policy of seizing and retaining private vehicles pending civil forfeiture proceedings without providing vehicle owners with a post-deprivation hearing before a neutral arbiter was unconstitutional.</p><p>The plaintiff was charged with several crimes relating to alleged possession of a firearm and was acquitted of all charges by jury trial. When seeking the return of his car, the police officers required him to pay a bond of over $1200 in order to challenge their possession of the vehicle. After reducing the bond to $800, the plaintiff began civil forfeiture proceedings but was not allowed to use the car in the interim.</p><p>On July 6, 2012, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the District's failure to provide a post-seizure hearing to plaintiff violated his due process rights and ordered District to release the vehicle pending the forfeiture hearing, ordered the plaintiff to keep his vehicle and maintain insurance during the hearing, and gave the plaintiff a security deposit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) for $1000.</p><p>On October 19, 2012, the parties agreed to a private settlement that is not publicly available. </p>",

Plaintiff’s \ncar was seized by the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”) on \nMay 29, 2011, when he was accused of weapons violations.  \nPlaintiff was acquitted of all charges in December 2011; \nnevertheless, the District of Columbia (“District”) continues to \nmaintain possession of the car in the hope of eventually getting \ntitle to it by prevailing in civil forfeiture litigation.  The \nforfeiture proceedings were not commenced until June 1, 2012 and \naccording to the District, could last another year, until June \n2013.   \nIn the nearly seven months following his acquittal, Mr. \nSimms has been unable to challenge the validity of the initial \nseizure and continuing retention of his vehicle prior to \njudgment in the forfeiture proceeding, nor will he have any \n\nopportunity to do so for the next year while those proceedings \nare pending.  He contends that the District’s failure to provide \nhim with the opportunity for a prompt post-deprivation hearing \nto challenge the seizure and subsequent retention of his car, \nprior to judgment in his civil forfeiture case, violates his \nFifth Amendment procedural due process rights.  He seeks an \norder enjoining the MPD from holding his vehicle, pending the \nconclusion of the forfeiture proceedings, without providing him \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard. \nUpon consideration of the plaintiff’s motion, the \nopposition and reply, the parties’ arguments during the June 13, \n2012 motions hearing, the supplemental briefs submitted by the \nparties both before and after the hearing, and for the reasons \nset forth below, the Court finds that the District’s failure to \nprovide Mr. Simms with a post-seizure hearing to challenge the \ndeprivation of his vehicle pending the conclusion of civil \nforfeiture proceedings violates his constitutionally-protected \ndue process rights.  Accordingly, the plaintiff’s motion for a \npreliminary injunction is GRANTED. \n2 \n \n\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background:  Forfeiture Procedures in the \nDistrict of Columbia               \n   \nForfeiture of vehicles in the District is governed by the \nprocedures set forth in D.C. Code § 48-905.02.1  Police are \nauthorized to seize a conveyance which, inter alia, law \nenforcement officials have probable cause to believe is being \nused to transport, possess, or conceal any firearm in violation \nof District law.  D.C. Code § 7-2507.06a(b);  § 48-\n905.02(d)(3)(A).  Police officers need not obtain a warrant \nbefore seizing a conveyance.   \nAfter seizing a vehicle, the MPD provides notice to any \nperson having “a right of claim to the seized property.”  Id. § \n48-905.02(d)(3)(A).  In order to assert a claim to the seized \nproperty, a person must, within thirty days from the date of \nreceipt of notice of seizure, “file a claim with [the MPD] \nstating his [] interest in the property.  Upon filing of a \nclaim, the claimant shall give a bond to the District government \nin the penal sum of $2500 or 10% of the fair market value of the \nclaimed property (as appraised by the Chief of the MPD), \n                                                            \n1 There are several other statutory procedures pertaining to \nforfeiture, but each employs the procedures outlined in § 48-\n905.02.  Forfeiture of property seized in connection with \nalleged firearms offenses, which is at issue in this case, is \ncovered by D.C. Code § 7-2507.06a. \n \n3 \n \n\nwhichever is lower, but not less than $250[.]”  Id. § 48-\n905.02(d)(3)(B).  According to District Municipal Regulations, a \nclaimant may apply for a waiver or reduction of the bond.  The \nMPD determines whether a claimant “is financially unable to give \nany bond or to give a bond in the required amount.”  6-A \nD.C.M.R. § 806.6 (1991).  Neither the statute nor the \nregulations requires the MPD to make that determination within a \nspecified period of time, however, nor do they provide a \nstandard set of criteria for determining whether and to what \nextent a claimant is able to give a bond.2   \nPayment of the bond does not enable property owners to have \ntheir property returned pending litigation.  Instead, the \nDistrict holds the property until it institutes forfeiture \nproceedings against the property in Superior Court.  D.C. Code § \n48-905.02(d)(3)(E).  Although the statute provides that \nproceedings be instituted “promptly,” id. § 48-905.02(c), there \nis no specified period of time in which the District must act; \nin Mr. Simms’s case, the District initiated forfeiture \nproceedings over a year after the seizure, and the District \n                                                            \n2 If the person does not file a claim and pay the bond (or apply \nfor a waiver of the bond) within thirty days of receipt of \nnotice, the District, “after determining that the property is \nforfeitable under this chapter, shall declare the property \nforfeited and shall dispose of the property” by retaining it for \nofficial use or selling it.  D.C. Code § 48-905.02(d)(3)(C); § \n48-905.02(d)(4). \n4 \n \n\nadmitted that the process was hastened as a direct result of the \nComplaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction plaintiff filed \nin this Court.  See, e.g., Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \n(“Opp’n”) at 3, Ex. 1, Decl. of Lt. Derek Gray (“Gray Decl.”) at \n¶¶ 22-25.  The forfeiture proceeding is the first opportunity in \nwhich an owner of the vehicle may challenge the District’s \nprobable cause for the seizure of the vehicle or its continued \ncustody of the vehicle.  See § 48-905.02(d)(2) (property owners \nmay not seek return of seized property through an action for \nreplevin).3 \nB.  Factual & Procedural Background \nOn May 29, 2011, MPD officers seized Mr. Simms’s car after \nthey claimed to find a firearm in a bag inside the vehicle.  \nCompl. ¶ 34.  The car was taken to the MPD’s impound lot in \nSouthwest D.C.  Id.  Mr. Simms was charged with several criminal \ncounts relating to the alleged possession of the firearm, found \nindigent, appointed counsel from the Public Defender Service, \nand, after a jury trial, was acquitted of all charges on \nDecember 7, 2011.  Id. ¶¶ 35-37.  The same day, he went to the \nMPD impound lot seeking return of his car, a 2007 Saturn Aura \n                                                            \n3 A person with “an interest in forfeited property” may file with \nthe Mayor a petition for remission or mitigation of the \nforfeiture, D.C. Code § 48-905.02(d)(3)(F), but the statute \nsuggests, and District counsel confirmed during the motions \nhearing, that this administrative option is not available until \nafter the property has been declared forfeited.  Id.   \n5 \n \n\nsedan.  Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Mot.”) at 3, n.2.  A \npolice officer informed him that he would be required to pay a \nbond of over $1200 in order to challenge MPD’s decision to take \npossession of his vehicle.  Compl. ¶ 38.  Plaintiff \nindependently learned that he could apply to get the bond \nreduced or waived; he was not informed by the District.  Compl. \nEx. A, Decl. of Frederick Simms (“Simms Decl.”)  ¶ 8.  He \nattempted to submit the application for waiver with the MPD, but \nwas told to get his application notarized and return with three \nyears of tax returns.  Id.  He did, and submitted his \napplication on March 19, 2012.  Id., see also Opp’n, Ex. 1, Gray \nDecl. ¶ 19.  On March 26, 2012, Lieutenant Derek Gray, the MPD’s \nProperty Clerk, reviewed the application for a waiver and \nreduced the bond to $800.  Gray Decl. ¶ 20.  Mr. Simms did not \npay the $800 bond which, as described in Section I.A supra, \nwould enable the start of adversarial forfeiture proceedings (at \na time entirely within District’s control) but would not permit \nhim to seek the use of his car in the interim.  Mr. Simms states \nthat having a vehicle is central to his ability to commute to \nwork, to perform his job, and to transport himself, his fiancée, \nand his 11-month-old daughter to doctors’ appointments, daycare, \nand visits to family members.  Simms Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, 10.  However, \nhe states, “I cannot afford to pay $800 to try to get my car \nback.  All of the money I make from my wages ($12 an hour at AAA \n6 \n \n\nStorage, in Sterling, Virginia) goes to transportation, rent, \ndaycare, utilities, groceries, car insurance, and the $360 a \nmonth I pay on the car loan to Andrews Federal Credit Union for \na car I can’t even use.”  Id. ¶ 9.4  Because Mr. Simms did not \npay the bond, the District was not obligated to commence \nforfeiture proceedings, and did not do so. \nPlaintiff filed this action on May 1, 2012, and \nsimultaneously filed a motion for preliminary injunction.  \nApparently in response to the litigation, on May 15, 2012, \nLieutenant Gray waived the bond on Mr. Simms’s vehicle.  Opp’n \nat 6, see also Gray Decl. ¶ 22.  As a result of the waiver of \nthe bond, on May 15, 2012, MPD forwarded the forfeiture file to \nthe District’s Office of Attorney General.  Id. ¶ 23.  On May \n18, 2012, the District filed a notice stating that “the civil \nforfeiture matter concerning the subject vehicle will be \nassigned to an attorney for further investigation.”  Defs.’ \nPraecipe Regarding Status of the Att’y Gen.’s Decision on Civil \nForfeiture.  On June 1, 2012, the District commenced forfeiture \nproceedings in Superior Court by filing a Libel of Information \nfor in rem civil forfeiture of Mr. Simms’s car.  During oral \nargument on the preliminary injunction motion, counsel for the \n                                                            \n4  Property owners must continue to make any loan payments while \nthe property is impounded; otherwise, the MPD will return the \nvehicle to the lender.  D.C. Code § 48-905.02(a)(4)(D).   \n \n7 \n \n\nDistrict stated that unless the forfeiture case settles, it will \ntake about a year to litigate, until June 2013.   \nSince the Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed in \nMay, the parties have completed briefing, each filed two \nsupplemental briefs, and the Court heard oral argument on June \n13, 2012.  Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is \nnow ripe for determination by the Court. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD FOR INTERIM INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that \nan injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. NRDC, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Because it is “an extraordinary remedy,” \na preliminary injunction “should be granted only when the party \nseeking the relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of \npersuasion.”  Cobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. \n2004) (citations omitted).   \nThese four factors have typically been evaluated on a \n“sliding scale,” whereby if the movant makes an unusually strong \nshowing on one of the factors, then he does not necessarily have \nto make as strong a showing on another factor.  Davis v. Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n8 \n \n\n(citing Davenport v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 361 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999)).  While it is unclear whether the “sliding \nscale” is still controlling in light of the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Winter, the Court need not decide this issue today \nbecause plaintiff has carried the burden of persuasion as to all \nfour factors.5  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nMr. Simms argues that he has satisfied all four criteria \nnecessary to obtain a preliminary injunction, while the \ndefendants argue that none of the criteria have been met.  The \nCourt will begin by addressing the likelihood of success on the \nmerits. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nTo maintain a procedural due process claim, the plaintiff \nfirst must establish that the government deprived him of a \n                                                            \n5  The District claims that Mr. Simms seeks a mandatory, as \nopposed to a prohibitory, injunction “that requires an even \ngreater showing.”  Opp’n at 8.  Some courts have held the movant \nfor a mandatory injunction to a higher burden: the movant must \nshow “clearly” that he is entitled to relief or that extreme or \nvery serious damage will result.  Vietch v. Danzig, 135 F. Supp. \n2d 32, 35 n.2 (D.D.C. 2001) (citations omitted).  The D.C. \nCircuit, however, has yet to address this question.  See, e.g., \nFriends for All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 746 \nF.2d 816, 834 n. 31 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“In this circuit, however, \nno case seems to squarely require a heightened showing, and we \nexpress no view as to whether a heightened showing should in \nfact be required.”). \n \n9 \n \n\nconstitutionally protected property interest, and then must \nestablish that the government’s procedures in doing so do not \nsatisfy procedural due process.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Jackson, 610 \nF.3d 110, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  The District does not contest \nthe first step of the analysis, namely, that Mr. Simms’s \ninterest in having access to and use of his car is a property \nright protected by the Due Process Clause, and that by seizing \nthe car, the District affected a deprivation of this property \ninterest.  See, e.g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 85, 89-90 \n(1972) (due process protection applies to pre-judgment \ndeprivation of household goods such as beds and stoves, even if \ndeprivation is only temporary); see also United States v. James \nDaniel Good, 510 U.S. 43, 48-49 (1993) (same, real property); \nSutton v. City of Milwaukee, 672 F.2d 644, 645 (7th Cir. 1982) \n(due process protections apply to the temporary detention of \nprivate automobiles); Coiknos v. Dist. of Columbia, 728 F.2d 502 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983) (following Sutton).  Accordingly, due process \napplies. \n“Once it is determined that due process applies, the \nquestion remains what process is due.”  Federal Deposit Ins. \nCorp. v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 240 (1988) (quoting Morrissey v. \nBrewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)).  As a threshold matter, the \nCourt must determine the appropriate test to apply in \nconsidering what post-seizure process is required for owners \n10 \n \n\nwhose vehicles are seized pursuant to forfeiture laws.  Mr. \nSimms urges the Court to follow two circuit court decisions: \nKrimstock v. Kelly, 306 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 2002) and Smith v. City \nof Chicago, 524 F.3d 834 (7th Cir. 2008) (vacated as moot by \nAlvarez v. Smith, 130 S. Ct. 576 (2009)).  Both of these \ndecisions, in turn, rely heavily on Good, 510 U.S. 43.  \nDefendants, for their part, contend that the appropriate test is \nset forth in United States v. Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and \nFifty Dollars ($8,850) in United States Currency, 461 U.S. 555 \n(1983) and United States v. Von Neumann, 474 U.S. 242 (1986).   \ni.  Krimstock and Smith6 \nIn Krimstock, the Second Circuit considered a forfeiture \nscheme under New York City law, which was very similar to the \nDistrict’s.  Police officers in the field could seize a vehicle \nbased on the officer’s determination that probable cause existed \nto believe the vehicle was subject to forfeiture because it had \nbeen used as an instrumentality of crime.  In Krimstock, the \ncrime at issue was drunk driving. 306 F.3d at 45.  New York City \nlaw did not provide a prompt, independent hearing for an owner \n                                                            \n6 The Supreme Court granted certiorari and received briefing in \nSmith, however, the Court subsequently learned that “there was \nno longer any dispute about the ownership or possession of the \nrelevant property.”  Alvarez v. Smith, 130 S. Ct. at 580.  As a \nresult, the Court declared the case moot and vacated the lower \ncourt opinion in accordance with its standard practice.  Id. at \n583.  Smith’s analysis and reasoning, as well as the forfeiture \nscheme (Chicago’s) before it, are substantially identical to \nKrimstock’s.  See generally Smith, 524 F.3d 834. \n11 \n \n\nto challenge the validity of the initial seizure or the City’s \ncontinued custody of the vehicle.  Id.  Finally, although the \nCity’s law required the City to initiate a civil forfeiture \nproceeding within twenty-five days from an owner’s demand for \nthe vehicle, in practice the City commonly held owners’ cars for \nmonths or years before providing any hearing on the forfeiture.  \nId. 46.  The holds on the vehicles continued long after any \nunderlying criminal proceeding had concluded.  Id. at 45-46. \nWriting for the panel, then-Judge Sotomayor found \nunconstitutional New York City’s continued retention of private \nvehicles seized incident to arrests, without providing vehicle \nowners a prompt post-seizure hearing at which the owners could \nchallenge the legitimacy of the initial seizure and the City’s \ncontinued retention of the vehicle pending forfeiture \nproceedings.  The Krimstock court relied on Mathews v. Eldridge, \n424 U.S. 319 (1976), and Good.  Mathews holds that the Due \nProcess Clause requires, in general, that when the government \nseeks to deprive an individual of property, it must provide a \nhearing before an impartial decision maker where the individual \nmay be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  \n424 U.S. at 333 (citations omitted).  In order to determine what \nprocess is required, three factors must be weighed: (1) the \nnature and weight of the private interest affected by the \nchallenged official action; (2) the risk of erroneous \n12 \n \n\ndeprivation given the procedures currently employed, and the \nprobable value of additional safeguards; and (3) the \ngovernment’s interest in avoiding additional procedural \nsafeguards.  Id. at 335.  In Good, the Court applied Mathews to \nthe realm of civil forfeiture.  Property owner James Daniel Good \nchallenged the government’s attempt to seize his house, which \nhad been used in connection with a drug offense, for civil \nforfeiture without prior notice and a hearing.  The Supreme \nCourt invalidated the seizure, holding that, absent exigent \ncircumstances, “individuals must receive notice and an \nopportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of \nproperty.”  510 U.S. at 48 (emphasis added).  When the \nforfeitable property is a vehicle connected with suspected \ncriminal activity, however, the Court recognized that the \nproperty’s mobility combined with the Government’s interest in \nthe property may create a “special need for very prompt action \nthat justifie[s] the postponement of notice and hearing until \nafter the seizure.”  Id. at 52 (citations omitted). \nThe Krimstock court applied Good to just such a situation – \nthe seizure and retention of vehicles pendente lite, until the \nconclusion of civil forfeiture proceedings.  Noting that even \n“temporary deprivation of real or personal property pendente \nlite in a forfeiture action must satisfy the demands of” \nprocedural due process, the Second Circuit found that the \n13 \n \n\ngovernment’s failure to provide a prompt post-seizure hearing to \nowners of impounded automobiles violated the Due Process Clause.  \n306 F.3d at 51.  Turning to the first Mathews factor, the court \nfound that the private interest affected, the deprivation of an \nautomobile, is significant in light of the centrality of the \nautomobile to modern life.  Id. at 61-62.  The court found the \nprivate interest at stake particularly significant given the \nlength of time owners could be without their cars under New York \nCity’s forfeiture scheme – months, if not years.  Id. at 54-55.   \nThe court found the second factor, the risk of erroneous \ndeprivation, weighed narrowly in favor of the City because “the \nrisk of erroneous seizure and retention of a vehicle is reduced \nin the case of a DWI owner-arrestee, because a trained police \nofficer’s assessment of the owner-driver’s state of intoxication \ncan typically be expected to be accurate.”  Id. at 62-63.  \nHowever, the court also found a significant risk of erroneous \ndeprivation, because the statute allowed the City to take \ncustody of automobiles suspected of use in criminal conduct \nwithout regard to whether the owner of the property was innocent \nof any wrongful activity.  Id. at 56-57.  Moreover, the City had \na pecuniary interest in the outcome of the proceeding; forfeited \nproperty could, at the discretion of the police, be used or sold \nby the government.  Id. at 63.  The risk of erroneous \ndeprivation was further enhanced because it was irreparable: an \n14 \n \n\nowner’s loss of his car for months or years could not be \nrecompensed if he prevailed at a later hearing.  Id. at 64.   \nFinally, the Second Circuit found the last Mathews factor, \nthe government’s interest in preventing the vehicles from being \nsold or destroyed, did not trump property owners’ due process \nrights because the government could protect its interests by \nother measures short of continued seizure.  Specifically, the \ngovernment could require claimants to post bonds before \nreclaiming their vehicles, or ask a court to issue a restraining \norder prohibiting the car from sale or destruction pending \nforfeiture proceedings.  Id. at 65.  The Krimstock court \nconcluded that protection of owners’ due process rights required \nthat owners be permitted to challenge the probable cause for the \ninitial warrantless seizure, as well as the probable validity of \nthe continued retention of the seized vehicle pendente lite, \npromptly after seizure and prior to the ultimate resolution of \nthe forfeiture action in court.  Id. at 49.  The hearing would \nbe “limited” and would not involve “exhaustive evidentiary \nbattles that might threaten to duplicate the eventual forfeiture \nhearing.”  Id. at 69-70; see also Smith, 524 F.3d at 839 (“The \npoint is to protect the rights of both an innocent owner and \nanyone else who has been deprived of property and . . . to see \nwhether a bond or an order can be fashioned to allow the \n15 \n \n\nlegitimate use of the property while the forfeiture proceeding \nis pending.”). \nii.  $8,850 and Von Neumann \nIn $8,850 and Von Neumann, the Supreme Court considered \nchallenges by property owners to the length of time between the \nseizure of their property and the forfeiture trials.  Both cases \ninvolved property seized by the United States Customs Service \nunder the same statutory scheme.  Under the statute, owners of \nseized property had two options:  petition the Secretary of the \nTreasury for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture within 60 \ndays of the seizure, or challenge the seizure in a judicial \nforfeiture action by the government.  $8850, 461 U.S. at 557; \nVon Neumann, 474 U.S. at 243.  In $8,850, claimant Mary \nJosephine Vasquez’s currency was seized by Customs at the \nairport.  Ms. Vasquez elected to file a petition, but it was \ndelayed pending the resolution of her criminal proceedings, \nwhich included a forfeiture count.  $8850, 461 U.S. at 558-60.  \nThree months after she was acquitted of the criminal charges \nrelating to the forfeiture, the government initiated civil \nforfeiture proceedings.  Id. at 560.  Ms. Velasquez moved to \ndismiss the forfeiture action, arguing that “the government’s \ndelay in filing a civil forfeiture proceeding,” for eighteen \nmonths after the initial seizure, “violated her due process \nright to a hearing at a meaningful time.”  Id. at 562 (citations \n16 \n \n\nomitted).  In Von Neumann, claimant John Von Neumann’s car was \nseized at the Canadian border.  Mr. Von Neumann also elected to \nfile a petition for remission.  474 U.S. at 245.  Two weeks \nafter filing, he posted a bond for the value of the car, which \nwas released to him.  Id. at 245-46.  He then filed a supplement \nto the remission petition.  Less than two weeks thereafter, and \na total of 36 days after the initial seizure, the government \nreduced his penalty from $24,500 to $3,600.  Id.  Mr. Von \nNeumann challenged the seizure and remission procedure on \nseveral grounds, including that the government’s “36-day delay \nin acting on his remission petition denied [him] due process of \nlaw.”  Id. at 247. \nThe Supreme Court found that neither delay violated the \nproperty owners’ constitutional rights.  The Court framed the \nissue as the delay between seizure and the outcome of the \njudicial forfeiture proceeding, and found that the property \nowners’ due process rights were analogous to “a defendant’s \nright to a speedy trial once an indictment or other process has \nissued.”  $8850, 461 U.S. at 564; Von Neumann, 474 U.S. at 247. \nThe Court used the four factor balancing test in Barker v. \nWingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), which provides the framework for \ndetermining when a criminal defendant’s case should be dismissed \nfor a violation of the Sixth Amendment’s right to a speedy \ntrial.  The four factors to be considered are: length of delay, \n17 \n \n\nreasons for delay, defendant’s assertion of his right to speedy \ntrial, and prejudice to the defendant.  407 U.S. at 530.7  The \nCourt did not consider, nor was it asked to consider, whether \nprocess was due to protect the owners’ property rights pendente \nlite, between the seizure and the conclusion of judicial \nforfeiture proceedings.8 \nAnalyzing the Barker factors, the $8850 court found that \nthe government had shown diligence and given reasonable \n                                                            \n7  Under Barker, delays of less than a year are, as a general \nmatter, constitutionally adequate, thus, the four factor test is \nnot triggered.  Dogett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 651 \n(1992).   \n \n8  Although the District has not made the argument, the Court has \nnevertheless considered whether Von Neumann addressed claimants’ \ndue process rights pendente lite with the statement: “[i]mplicit \nin this Court’s discussion of timeliness in $8,850 was the view \nthat the forfeiture proceeding, without more, provides the \npostseizure hearing required by due process to protect Von \nNewmann’s property interest in the car.”  474 U.S. at 249.   \nThis statement does not affect the outcome in this case for the \nfollowing reasons.  First, as discussed throughout, $8,850 and \nVon Neumann addressed when forfeiture proceedings had to be \nabandoned altogether for lack of due process, not what interim \nprocess must be provided pending an otherwise valid proceeding.  \nSecond, the Court in $8,850 and Von Newmann was faced with a \ndifferent statutory scheme than the District’s, one which \nprovided claimants opportunities to trigger a rapid filing of a \nforfeiture action.  The Court in both cases relied on the \navailability of these opportunities, which do not exist in the \nDistrict’s forfeiture scheme, in determining what process was \ndue.  Finally, both $8,850 and Von Neumann predate Good, which \napplied the Mathews factors to property seized pending civil \nforfeiture proceedings and determined that temporary \ndeprivations of property in the forfeiture context require due \nprocess pendente lite.  This Court finds Good is the most recent \nas well as the most closely applicable binding precedent in this \ncase.     \n18 \n \n\nexplanations for the delay, that Ms. Vasquez had not \nconsistently asserted her rights to speedy judicial proceedings, \nand that the delay did not prejudice her ability to present a \nclaim on the merits of the forfeiture.  461 U.S. at 569.  The \nVon Neumann court found that Mr. Von Neumann’s speedy trial \nrights did not apply to elective remission proceedings, which, \nif chosen, “supply both the Government and the claimant a way to \nresolve [their] dispute informally rather than in judicial \nforfeiture proceedings.”  474 U.S. at 249.  Instead, his speedy \ntrial rights applied solely to the length of time between \nseizure and institution of judicial forfeiture proceedings.  As \nthe seizure of his vehicle was resolved, within 36 days, via the \nremission proceedings, no judicial forfeiture proceedings began \nand there was therefore no basis for a Barker inquiry.  Id.  In \nthe alternative, the Von Neumann court applied the Barker \nfactors and found that, under Barker, a 36-day delay between \nseizure and final disposition of his remission petition did not \nviolate his speedy trial rights.  Id. at 250-51.  Both Courts \nalso observed that, notwithstanding any delays in the \nadministrative or judicial proceedings, “a claimant is able to \ntrigger rapid filing of a forfeiture action if he desires it,” \nby, inter alia, filing an equitable action seeking an order \ncompelling the return of the seized property or, if the claimant \nbelieves the initial seizure was improper, filing a motion for \n19 \n \n\nreturn of the seized property under Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 41(e).  461 U.S. at 569; 474 U.S. at 244, n.4.  \niii.  Krimstock and the Mathews factors apply in this \ncase. \n \nPlaintiff urges the Court to apply Krimstock and the \nMathews v. Eldridge factors in this case.  He argues that the \nspeedy trial test articulated in Barker v. Wingo and applied in \n$8,850 and Von Neumann addresses a question of law which is \nirrelevant to the issues in this case.   \nBarker and its progeny involve an individual claiming that \nthe legal process has taken so long that the Constitution \nmandates that the government should no longer be able to \nmaintain its criminal prosecution (or, in this case, civil \nforfeiture) at all. . . . But Mr. Simms seeks something \nentirely different.  He seeks—recognizing that the \nConstitution allows civil legal proceedings to take a very \nlong time—a prompt post-seizure hearing at which a neutral \ndecision maker can determine whether the initial seizure \nwas valid and whether continued retention of his vehicle \npending lengthy forfeiture proceedings is justified in \nlight of the circumstances brought to the neutral arbiter’s \nattention. \n \nReply at 2.  Defendants, for their part, assert that $8,850 and \nVon Neumann limit a property owner’s due process rights in a \ncivil forfeiture context to a Barker analysis.  Opp’n at 9.  \nThey do not, however, explain why Mathews protections do not \napply to protect the owner’s property rights pendente lite.9  \n                                                            \n9 Defendants also cite a 2011 case from the Illinois Supreme \nCourt, People v. One 1998 GMC, 960 N.E.2d 1071 (Ill. 2011) in \nsupport of their argument that Barker, not Mathews, provides all \nthe process that is due in civil forfeiture proceedings.  The \nCourt finds this case to be of limited value for several \n20 \n \n\n  The Court agrees with plaintiff.  The question in this case \nis what process is due when the government seeks to deprive a \nperson of a property interest pending a final decision on the \ndeprivation.  The Supreme Court has consistently answered this \nquestion by applying the Mathews factors, balancing the parties’ \ninterests to determine what constitutes an individual’s \nprocedural due process right to be heard “at a meaningful time \nand in a meaningful manner” when the government acts to deprive \na person of his property, even when the deprivation is temporary \nand pending the outcome of further proceedings.10  Barker does \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nreasons.  First and most important, by the time One 1998 GMC was \ndecided, the civil forfeiture law that the court upheld was no \nlonger the law; the state had amended it to provide more interim \nprocess, specifically, to “allow for a timely probable cause \nhearing in vehicle-forfeiture proceedings going forward.”  960 \nN.E.2d at 1093.  Second, the trial court in that case provided a \nBarker remedy, namely, dismissing all of the forfeiture claims \nwith prejudice instead of confining its relief to the interim \nstatus of the vehicles pending forfeiture proceedings.  Third, \nthe Illinois law, even pre-amendment, provided significantly \nmore interim process for car owners to promptly challenge state \nretention of their vehicles than New York City’s or the \nDistrict’s.  See id. at 1084 (owner, on his own, may file motion \nchallenging unlawful seizure and moving for return of property \nwithout waiting for forfeiture proceedings; owner may also file \nearly motion to dismiss challenging State’s allegation of \nprobable cause).  \n10 See, e.g., Good, 510 U.S. 43 (applying Mathews factors, \nconcluding prior hearing is required before pre-judgment seizure \nof real property); Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1 (1991) \n(Mathews factors require prior hearing before pre-judgment \nattachment of real property); Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55 \n(1979) (Mathews requires prompt post-deprivation hearing when \n21 \n \n\nnot address this issue.  Rather, it asks how long a government \nmay keep open a case before it is fundamentally unfair to allow \nit to continue.  The Barker test, therefore, does not apply. \niv.  Under the Mathews factors, a Prompt Post-\nDeprivation Hearing is Required  \n \nApplying the Mathews factors to the facts and circumstances \nof this case, the Court concludes, for many of the reasons \nstated in Krimstock and Smith, that Mr. Simms is likely to \nprevail on his claim that the District violated his rights under \nthe Due Process Clause by failing to provide him with notice and \na prompt post-seizure opportunity to contest the validity of the \ninitial seizure, as well as the validity of the government’s \ncontinuing retention of the vehicle pending judicial forfeiture \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nhorse trainer’s license was suspended); United States v. E-Gold, \n521 F.3d 411 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Mathews requires prompt post-\ndeprivation hearing after assets seized on a warrant pending \ntrial on merits, where defendants assert access to assets is \nnecessary to pay counsel of their choice); Coleman v. Watt, 40 \nF.3d 255, 260 (8th Cir. 1994) (prompt post-deprivation hearing \nrequired after car towed and impounded); Breath v. Cronvich, 729 \nF.2d 1006 (5th Cir. 1984) (prompt post-seizure hearing required \nafter automobile is towed; hearing may be delayed only if owner \nis permitted to regain the use of the automobile in the \ninterim).  Even before Mathews was decided, the Supreme Court \nengaged in a similar balancing test to determine what interim \nprocess was due.  See, e.g., Fuentes, 407 U.S. at 80-81 (hearing \nrequired before ex parte, pre-judgment seizure of household \ngoods, finding plaintiff had an important interest in items such \nas a stove or a bed and the risk of unfair or mistaken \ndeprivation of property was great); North Georgia Finishing, \nInc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601 (1975) (considering same and \nrequiring hearing before pre-judgment garnishment of bank \naccount); Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337 (1969) \n(considering same factors and finding hearing is necessary \nbefore pre-judgment garnishment of wages).   \n22 \n \n\nproceedings.                   \n  An individual has a strong interest in his car.  Our \nsociety is “for good or not, highly dependent on the \nautomobile.”  Smith, 524 F.3d at 838.  It is often an \nindividual’s “most valuable possession,” as well as his or her \nprimary “mode of transportation, and for some, the means to earn \na livelihood.”  Krimstock, 306 F.3d at 61 (citations omitted); \ncf. City of Los Angeles v. David, 538 U.S. 715, 717-18 (2003) \n(temporary deprivation of the use of money does not give rise to \na strong private interest, as opposed to the temporary \ndeprivation of the use of an automobile, which does).  In \naddition, the length of the deprivation increases the weight of \nthe individual’s interest in possessing the vehicle.  Krimstock \nat 61-62 (citing Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 434 \n(1982)).  Unlike many other jurisdictions, which provide some \nopportunity for owners of seized vehicles to mount interim \nchallenges to the seizure and retention of their cars, the \nDistrict provides an individual no opportunity to lessen the \nlength of the deprivation by, for example, filing a remission \npetition or an action for replevin, or seeking a hardship \nexception to indefinite seizure.11           \n                                                            \n11 See, e.g., One 1998 GMC, 960 N.E.2d at 1084 (explaining \nIllinois statutory scheme enabling owners to move for return of \nproperty or file early motion to dismiss based on lack of \nprobable cause); Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA), 18 \n23 \n \n\n  The District argues that Mr. Simms cannot prevail on the \nfirst Mathews factor because, regardless of “the generalized \ninterest that other people may have in the use of their own \ncars,” Mr. Simms himself can “get to work and carry on his usual \nactivities using public transportation and other means,” Opp’n \nat 12, “with little more than inconvenience,” id. at 15.  The \nCourt is not convinced.  As an initial matter, as plaintiff \ncorrectly points out, the District’s argument “misunderstands \nthe level of generality at which Mathews operates.”  Reply at 9.  \nMathews and its progeny involve the “weighing of fiscal and \nadministrative burdens against the interest of a particular \ncategory of claimants,” to determine what process is due.  \nMathews, 424 U.S. at 348 (analyzing the importance of Social \nSecurity disability benefits to all recipients as a category); \nsee also Good, 510 U.S. at 43 (analyzing property owners’ \ninterest in their real property regardless of whether they lived \nin the property or, like Mr. Good, rented it to tenants).  \nMoreover, contrary to the District’s representations, Mr. Simms \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nU.S.C. § 983(f) (permitting immediate release of property \npending forfeiture litigation if government retention would \ncause serious hardship); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-4112 (c),(d) \n(interest holder can obtain a preliminary probable cause hearing \nwithin thirty five days of seizure; can also apply for interim \nreturn of property if it is necessary for the defense of the \nperson’s criminal charge); Minn. Stat. Ann. § 609.531(5a)(a)(b) \n(owner may post bond to have seized property returned before \nforfeiture action is determined, and can gain possession in the \ninterim by surrendering the vehicle’s certificate of title). \n24 \n \n\nhas shown that he, personally, has a strong interest in his \nvehicle.  Plaintiff states that without his car it takes him \nover three hours per day to commute to and from work via public \ntransportation, costs the equivalent of three-and-a-third hours \nof his wages to do so, has resulted in reprimands for tardiness \nwhich could lead to termination of his employment, and has \nseverely impeded his ability to transport his family to \nnecessary life events such as day care and doctors’ \nappointments.  Simms Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4, 10. \nTurning to the second factor, the Court finds there is at \nleast some risk of erroneous deprivation when the District \nseizes a vehicle pursuant to a traffic stop.  Moreover, the \nprobable value of additional procedural safeguards is high.  \nFirst, there is an inherent risk of error when a seizure is \nbased a traffic stop: namely, its validity rests solely on the \narresting officer’s unreviewed probable cause determination.  \nSee, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 112-13 (1975) \n(requiring prompt probable cause determination before a neutral \nmagistrate following a warrantless arrest, because of the risk \nof unfounded charges of crime when arrest is based solely on \nevidence interpreted “by the officer engaged in the often \ncompetitive enterprise of ferreting out crime”(citations \nomitted)).   \n25 \n \n\nSecond, with respect to innocent owners, the danger of \nerroneous deprivation is particularly high.  “In the due process \ncontext, the Supreme Court has shown special concern for the \nrisk of erroneous deprivation posed to innocent owners.”  \nKrimstock, 306 F.3d at 55-56 (citing Good, 510 U.S. at 55).  The \nD.C. Code provides an absolute defense to forfeiture of vehicles \nfor innocent owners.  It provides: \n(c)  An innocent owner’s interest in a conveyance which has \nbeen seized shall not be forfeited under this section. \n(1) A person is an innocent owner if he or she \nestablishes, by a preponderance of                                \nthe evidence:          \n(A) That he or she did not know that a person or \npersons in the conveyance was transporting, \npossessing, or concealing any firearm or that the \nconveyance was involved in or was being used in \nthe commission of any illegal act involving any \nfirearm; or \n(B) That, upon receiving knowledge of the \npresence of any illegal firearm in or on the \nconveyance or that the conveyance was being used \nin the commission of an illegal act involving a \nforfeiture, he or she took action to terminate \nthe presence in or on the conveyance of the \nperson, persons, or firearms. \n \nD.C. Code § 7-2507.06a(c).  In the rush of a traffic stop, it \nmay be particularly difficult for a police officer to accurately \nassess whether a vehicle owner knew about any firearms or other \ncontraband concealed in the vehicle.  See, e.g., D.C. Code § 48-\n905.02(a)(4)(B) (no forfeiture of vehicle used to transport \ndrugs if the vehicle was used for this purpose without the \nowner’s knowledge or consent).  Under the District’s current \n26 \n \n\nforfeiture scheme, however, innocent owners are given no \nopportunity to test the probable validity of the District’s \ncontinued impoundment of their vehicles after the seizure and \npending forfeiture proceedings.   \n  The District argues that there is no compelling risk of \nerroneous deprivation in this case because the District \nconducted investigations leading to Mr. Simms’s arrest, making a \nprobable cause determination for the forfeiture, and preparing \nfor the judicial forfeiture proceedings.  Opp’n at 15.  The \nDistrict ignores, however, that all three of these \ninvestigations are ex parte by the District and contemplate no \ninvolvement of the owner or a neutral arbiter.  See D.C. Code §§ \n48-905.02(b), (c), (d)(3)(E).  “Fairness can rarely be obtained \nby secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights. \n. . . No better instrument has been devised for arriving at \ntruth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice \nof the case against him and opportunity to meet it.”  Good, 510 \nU.S. at 55 (quoting Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, \n341 U.S. 123, 170-72 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)).  \nLikewise, the District’s argument that Mr. Simms will ultimately \nlose his civil forfeiture case is unpersuasive.  The strength of \nan individual’s case at the ultimate forfeiture proceeding does \nnot diminish his “possessory interest post seizure and pre-\njudgment.”  Krimstock, 306 F.3d at 62.  “Fair procedures are not \n27 \n \n\nconfined to the innocent.  The question before us is the \nlegality of the seizure,” as well as the continuing interim \nretention, “not the strength of the Government’s case.”  Good, \n510 U.S. at 62. \nFinally, the risk of erroneous deprivation is cause for \nheightened concern when the deprivation “cannot be recompensed \nby the claimant’s prevailing in later proceedings.”  Krimstock \nat 63.  Unlike certain deprivations such as Social Security \nDisability benefits, which are not based on financial need and \nfor which full retroactive relief can be awarded if plaintiff \nlater prevails, see Mathews, 424 U.S. at 340, “an owner cannot \nrecover the lost use of a vehicle by prevailing in a forfeiture \nproceeding.  The loss is felt in the owner’s inability to use a \nvehicle that continues to depreciate in value as it stands idle \nin the police lot,” Krimstock, 306 F.3d at 64.12   \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that there is at \nleast some risk of erroneous deprivations for vehicle owners \n                                                            \n12 Plaintiff also claims the MPD’s pecuniary interest in the \noutcome of the forfeiture proceedings (specifically, the fact \nthat the MPD receives a portion of the revenue from forfeiture \nsales), further increases the risk of erroneous deprivation.  \nMot. at 18-20.  In response, the District has provided \ninformation that, in Fiscal Year 2011, the net revenue MPD \nreceived from forfeiture sales amounted to less than one tenth \nof one percent of MPD’s budget.  Supp’l Opp’n at 4 (citing Ex. \n2, Decl. of Leroy Clay).  At this stage of the proceedings, the \nCourt does not rely on MPD’s pecuniary interest in finding a \nrisk of erroneous deprivation. \n \n28 \n \n\nlike Mr. Simms, whose vehicles have been seized pursuant to \ntraffic stops and are not needed as evidence in the underlying \ncriminal proceeding.13 \nThese risks could be mitigated by additional procedural \nsafeguards.  Plaintiff requests a hearing before a neutral \narbiter at which owners would be able to challenge both “the \nvalidity of the initial seizure and the validity of the \ncontinued impoundment of the car pending any forfeiture \nlitigation.”  Mot. at 2.  At such a hearing, the owner would be \nable to, in some form or fashion, (1) obtain review of the \narresting officer’s probable cause determination; (2) if \nappropriate, assert an innocent owner or other defense to \nforfeiture; and (3) seek conditions from the arbiter under which \nthe vehicle could be returned on an interim basis pending \nforfeiture proceedings while still protecting the District’s \ninterest in the vehicle.  For example, the arbiter could order \nthe owner to give bond or surrender title, or could issue an \norder restraining the owner from selling or disposing of the \nvehicle pending the outcome of forfeiture proceedings.  See, \n                                                            \n13 The District claims, wrongly, that granting Mr. Simms’s \npreliminary injunction would give him “the opportunity to drive \noff with the evidence in the criminal proceeding.”  Defs.’ \nSupp’l Opp’n at 3.  As plaintiff makes clear, his motion \naddresses only “whether Mathews requires certain procedures to \nbe followed when the District, after that evidence is no longer \nneeded (i.e., after the criminal prosecution is over) seeks to \ncontinue depriving the owner of the property.”  Pl.’s Resp. to \nDefs.’ Supplement at 3-4.   \n29 \n \n\ne.g., Good, 510 U.S. at 62; Smith, 524 F.3d at 836 (additional \nprocedures such as a temporary restraining order preventing the \nsale or destruction of the property or bond would allow owners \nto retain their property pendente lite, thus mitigating the risk \nof erroneous deprivation).           \n  Finally, the third Mathews factor, the District’s interest \nin avoiding additional procedural safeguards, also weighs in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  The District claims it has an interest in \n“avoiding additional procedures that would greatly increase the \ncost of forfeiture,” Opp’n at 12,  but it presents no evidence \nregarding the potential burden of alternative procedural \nmeasures to ensure that accurate determinations regarding \ndeprivation of property are made.  In supplemental filings, the \nDistrict also cites its interest in removing instrumentalities \nof crime from the streets, thereby preventing future crime.  \nSupp’l Opp’n at 7.  This Court finds, however, that this \ninterest is somewhat attenuated since Mr. Simms was acquitted of \nmisconduct in the criminal proceeding, and since his misconduct \nhas yet to be established in a civil proceeding.  Until that \ntime comes, his motor vehicle can serve many legitimate \npurposes.  See Krimstock, 306 F.3d at 66-67 (rejecting the \ngovernment’s interest in preventing offending vehicles from \nbeing used in future crime). \n30 \n \n\n Finally, although the District does not argue that it has \nan interest in protecting its interest in the vehicles in the \nevent they are ultimately subject to forfeiture, the alternative \nprocedural safeguards outlined above (such as requiring owners \nto give bond to obtain interim release of their vehicles, or \nobtaining orders prohibiting them from selling or disposing of \nthe vehicles pending judicial forfeiture proceedings) would \nprotect these interests.      \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Mr. Simms is \nlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim: the Due Process \nClause requires that a vehicle owner whose vehicle has been \nseized, and is not being held as evidence, be given a prompt \npost-seizure opportunity to test the validity of the initial \nseizure and of the District’s continuing retention during the \npendency of forfeiture proceedings. \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nMr. Simms argues that he will suffer irreparable harm if \nthe Court does not provide him with his car until either the \nconclusion of the forfeiture proceedings or until the District \ncan provide him with notice and an opportunity to be heard \npendente lite.  He alleges that as result of the loss of his \ncar, his employment is in jeopardy, he is unable to spend time \nwith his infant daughter, and he is unable to take her as well \n31 \n \n\nas his fiancée to doctors’ appointments, daycare, and family \ngatherings.  In addition, he asserts that deprivation of his due \nprocess rights alone constitutes irreparable harm.  The District \nhas argued that the loss of Mr. Simms’s automobile does not \nconstitute irreparable harm for him specifically, as he is still \nable to get to work and take care of his family.  The District \ndoes not address plaintiff’s argument that deprivation of his \nconstitutional rights is per se irreparable harm. \nThis Circuit has set a high standard for irreparable \ninjury.  First, the injury “must be both certain and great; it \nmust be actual and not theoretical.”  Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam). The plaintiff must \nshow “[t]he injury complained of is of such imminence that there \nis a clear and present need for equitable relief to prevent \nirreparable harm.”  Id. (citations, brackets, and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Second, the injury must be beyond \nremediation.  Id.  “It has long been established that the loss \nof constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’”  Mills v. Dist. \nof Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Elrod \nv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)).           \n  As explained above, Mr. Simms is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of his claim that the District’s forfeiture scheme \nviolates his Fifth Amendment right to due process by failing to \n32 \n \n\nprovide him with a prompt post-seizure hearing to challenge the \nvalidity of the seizure of his vehicle, and the District’s \nindefinite retention of the vehicle, pending forfeiture \nproceedings.  This injury is certain, because it has already \noccurred, and is ongoing, because the District has held his car \nfor over a year and has yet to provide plaintiff with any type \nof hearing.  Accordingly, the Court finds this deprivation of \nplaintiff’s constitutional rights constitutes irreparable harm.  \nSee Gordon v. Holder, 826 F. Supp. 2d 279, 296 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(violation of plaintiff’s procedural due process rights creates \nirreparable harm); Goings v. Court Services and Offender \nSupervision Agency, 786 F. Supp. 2d 48, 78-79 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(same).  \nC.  Balancing of the Equities and the Public Interest \nThe plaintiff argues that the District will not be harmed \nby the narrow remedy he seeks, namely, permitting the plaintiff \nto recover his car, on condition that he maintain insurance and \nrefrain from selling or otherwise disposing of it, pending a \nfinal decision on the merits.  Reply at 15-17; Pl.’s Response to \nDefs.’ Supp’l Mem. at 10.  Mr. Simms further argues that the \npublic interest weighs in favor of protecting a party’s \nconstitutional rights.  Pl.’s Response to Defs.’ Supp’l Mem. at \n10-15; Pl.’s Supp’l Mem. at 5-10.  The District, for its part, \n33 \n \n\nclaims that granting the preliminary injunction would “call into \nquestion the entire forfeiture scheme, undermining the \nDistrict’s ability to seize property for any and all purposes.”  \nOpp’n at 15; see also Supp’l Opp’n at 7 (“The District would \neffectively be blocked from using civil forfeiture as a law \nenforcement tool, since the Court’s decision would undoubtedly \nbe asserted by claimants in one way or another in every \nforfeiture unless and until there is a legislative solution \nalong the lines of an order issued by the Court.”); Defs.’ \nSupp’l Filing of June 22, 2012 at 4-5 (same).  Defendants also \nargue that requiring them to implement notice and hearing \nprocedures would cause an administrative and financial burden.  \nOpp’n at 15. \nAfter careful consideration, the Court concludes that the \nbalance of the equities and the public interest tip in favor of \nthe plaintiff.  Mr. Simms has demonstrated that the loss of his \nvehicle harms his ability to go about the necessities of daily \nlife, and the District’s continued retention of his vehicle \nwithout the opportunity to be heard deprives him of his \nconstitutionally-protected rights.  “It is always in the public \ninterest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional \nrights.”  Abdah v. Bush, No. Civ. A. 04-1254, 2005 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 4942, *22 (D.D.C. Ma. 29, 2005) (quoting G&V Lounge, Inc. \nv. Mich. Liquor Control Comm’n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. \n34 \n \n\n1994)); see also Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. \n2012); Freedberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 703 F. Supp. 107, 111 \n(D.D.C. 1988) (citation omitted).  \nThe harms predicted by the District, on the other hand, are \noverstated.  Defendants claim that a preliminary injunction \nwould bring the entire forfeiture system to a grinding halt.  \nPlaintiff, however, does not seek to enjoin the statute in \ngeneral.  He seeks, for the time being, only to prevent the \nDistrict from continuing to hold one vehicle in particular.  The \npreliminary injunction he requests is narrowly tailored to (1) a \nsingle individual, (2) whose vehicle was seized and continues to \nbe held by the District pending forfeiture proceedings, (3) who \nhas made a claim for his vehicle in accordance with the \ngoverning statute, and (4) whose vehicle is neither needed as \nevidence in a criminal proceeding, nor subject to criminal \nforfeiture or any other holds.14   \nDefendants also claim that requiring them to implement \nnotice and hearing procedures would cause an administrative and \nfinancial burden; however, the preliminary injunction does not \n                                                            \n14  According to the District’s own numbers, provided at the \nCourt’s request, there are, at maximum, eight to ten people per \nmonth who are similarly situated.  Supp’l Opp’n at Ex. 3; Supp’l \nDecl. of Lt. Derek Gray at ¶ 5.b.  Even if the injunction \nreached beyond plaintiff himself, which it does not, these \nnumbers contradict any claim that the District’s interest in \ncontinuing to exercise its forfeiture powers – an interest the \nCourt recognizes - will be much affected by the preliminary \ninjunction. \n35 \n \n\nrequire these measures.  As Mr. Simms points out, Defendants \n“make no arguments as to why the process sought here would be \ncostly, let along why those costs would overwhelm the other \nconstitutional considerations.”  Reply at 16; see also Smith, \n524 F.3d at 838 (“[D]ue process always imposes some burden on a \ngoverning entity.”). \n The District relies on two cases which the Court raised \nwith the parties during briefing -- Allina Health Svcs. v. \nSebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d 61 (D.D.C. 2010) and Goings v. Court \nServices and Offender Supervision Agency for the Dist. of \nColumbia, 786 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.D.C. 2011) –- in support of its \npublic interest argument.  Both are distinguishable.  In Allina, \nplaintiff hospitals asked the court to grant a preliminary \ninjunction which would have required the Department of Health \nand Human Services to create a separate method of calculating \nMedicare reimbursement for them and to change the government’s \npayment processing system for plaintiff hospitals accordingly.  \nAs Judge Collyer correctly noted, this would create a tremendous \nadministrative burden for the government at the preliminary \ninjunction stage.  She found that imposing this “disruptive \nremedy” would not be in the public interest, particularly since \nthe D.C. Circuit was in the process of deciding another case on \nprecisely the same grounds, which would control the outcome of \nthe case before her and potentially create competing, \n36 \n \n\ninconsistent reimbursement requirements.  756 F. Supp. 2d at 70-\n71.  In this case, unlike Allina, the preliminary injunction \ndoes not force the defendants to craft a new procedure.  Nor, as \nfar as the Court is aware, are there any pending cases which \nwould control the outcome of this one.   \nGoings is likewise distinguishable.  Mr. Goings, a \nconvicted sex-offender who was on probation and who was \ntransferred from Florida to the District through an interstate \ncompact, claimed certain conditions of probation were imposed on \nhim in the District without due process, and sought to enjoin \nthe conditions.  While Judge Howell found plaintiff was likely \nto succeed on the merits, she found that the preliminary \ninjunction was not in the public interest because the Court had \nno information on how conditions of probation were imposed \neither in the District or in other states whose probationers \nwere transferred throughout the country under the interstate \ncompact.  Accordingly, given the possibility that an injunction \nwould cast doubt “on non-judicial modifications of probation \nconditions placed upon offenders transferred under [the \ninterstate compact] across the country,” and in light of “the \ncurrent incomplete record before the Court and the lack of any \nconstructive input from the parties about the scope or impact” \nof a preliminary injunction, Judge Howell declined to grant \nplaintiff’s request.  786 F. Supp. 2d at 79-80.  In this case, \n37 \n \n\non the other hand, no laws beyond the District’s forfeiture \nscheme are implicated and no other states’ processes are at \nissue.  Moreover, the Court has before it precise information, \nprovided by the District, about the number of people similarly \nsituated to Mr. Simms.  See supra n.14.  Accordingly, Judge \nHowell’s concerns in Goings lack force here. \nThe Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated \nthat the balance of the equities and the public interest tip in \nhis favor. \nD.  Security                   \n   \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), “the court may \nissue a preliminary injunction . . . only of the movant gives security \nin an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and \ndamages substained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined \nor restrained.”  Courts in this Circuit have found the Rule “vest[s] \nbroad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate \namount of an injuction bond,”  DSE, Inc. v. Uniter States, 169 F.3d \n21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), including the discretion to require no bond \nat all.  Council on American-Islamic Rels. v. Gaubatz, 667 F. Supp. 2d \n67, 80 (D.D.C. 2009).                 \n  In this case, the costs or damages sustained by the District \nwould be modest -- the loss of the amount for which Mr. Simms’ car \ncould be sold at forfeiture.  Moreover, as discussed above, plaintiff \nhas extremely limited financial resources, and is unable to post \nsecurity in any significant amount.  Courts regularly take both of \n38 \n \n\nthese factors into account when exercising their discretion to require \na bond.  See Id. at 80 (requiring no bond where the defendant would \nnot be substantially injured by the issuance of an injunction); \nSwanson v. Univ. of Hawaii Prof. Assembly, 269 F. Supp. 2d 1252 (D. \nHaw. 2003) (bond requirement for public employees waived based on \nability to pay, and also because injunction sought enforcement of \nconstitutional rights); see also 11A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. \nMiller, Mary K. Kane, Richard L. Marcus, Federal Pracrtice and \nProcedure § 2954 (2d ed.) (same).  Accordingly, based on the record in \nthis case, in particular the District’s interest in the value of the \ncar as compared with plaintiff’s limited ability to pay a bond and the \nconstitutional rights he seeks to protect, the Court will exercise its \ndiscretion in this case to impose a minimal security requirement.  \nPlaintiff shall give security in the amount of $1,000.    \nIV.  CONCLUSION                   \n   \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction is GRANTED.  It is hereby \n  ORDERED that the District shall forthwith release Mr. \nSimms’s vehicle to him pending the outcome of the forfeiture \nproceedings which were instituted in the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia, District of Columbia v. One 2007 Saturn \nAura V.I.N. 1G8ZS57N17F291738, Civ. Action No. 4742-12 (Libel); \nit is further         \n39 \n \n\nORDERED that Mr. Simms shall not sell or otherwise dispose \nof the vehicle pending the outcome of the forfeiture \nproceedings; it is further           \n  ORDERED that Mr. Simms shall maintain insurance on his \nvehicle pending the outcome of the forfeiture proceedings; it is \nfurther                     \n  ORDERED that Mr. Simms shall give security as required by \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) in the amount of $1000.00. \nAn appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion. \nSigned:  Emmet G.

Plaintiff Frederick Simms, by and through his attorneys, brings this action for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants the District of Columbia, the Chief of Police \nof the Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\"), and the Mayor of the District of Columbia \nfrom their unconstitutional policy of seizing private vehicles and retaining them indefinitely \npending potential civil forfeiture proceedings, without providing property owners with a prompt, \npost-deprivation hearing before a neutral arbiter. \n2.  Mr. Simms alleges as follows, based on personal knowledge as to matters in \nwhich he has personal involvement and information and belief as to all other matters. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 2 of 12\nNature of the Action \n3.  Mr. Simms is a D.C. resident whose car was seized by MPD officers after MPD \nofficers claimed to find a firearm in a bag inside the vehicle on May 29, 2011. \n4.  Mr. Simms was acquitted by a jury of all charges arising out of the incident on \nDecember 7, 2011.  When Mr. Simms sought to retrieve his vehicle at the impoundment lot, he \nwas informed by the MPD that police intended to attempt to take legal ownership of his car \nthrough the District's civil forfeiture laws. \n5.  D.C.'s civil forfeiture scheme does not provide for a prompt, post-deprivation \nhearing in which property owners can test the validity of the District's warrantless seizure of \ntheir vehicles, and can challenge the validity of the District's continued retention of the vehicle \npending a determination on the merits of any forfeiture action.  In accordance with MPD and \nDistrict policy, Mr. Simms has received no such hearing since the seizure and impoundment of \nhis car. \n6.  Mr. Simms was instead told that in order merely to challenge the forfeiture of his \ncar, he must pay a bond of over $1,200 dollars to the MPD.  Mr. Simms applied for a waiver of \nthe bond on account of indigence, submitting extensive financial records in support of his \nrequest.  An MPD official reduced the bond to $800-an amount Mr. Simms cannot afford. \n7.  As a matter of District policy, payment of that sum is required before the District \nwill even file its initial civil suit formally to forfeit the vehicle in Superior Court.  Because Mr. \nSimms cannot pay the bond, he is afforded no opportunity to challenge the ultimate forfeiture of \nhis car by the District.  Under D.C.'s statutory civil forfeiture scheme and District policy, the \nMPD may sell the car at auction if the bond is not paid within 30 days of the owner receiving \nnotice of the forfeiture. \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 3 of 12\n8.  Mr. Simms has suffered and continues to suffer grave hardships flowing from the \nloss of his car.  He is experiencing difficulty taking his 11-month-old daughter to daycare and \nappointments.  He was forced to move away from his mother's home in D.C. in order to rent an \napartment nearer to his job in Sterling, Virginia.  Eventually, he moved back to D.C. and now \nfaces a daily commute of between one-and-a-half to two hours each way.  And that job, which \nrequires him to travel to several geographic locations, is in jeopardy because his employer \nrequires employees to have a reliable vehicle.  Moreover, he is forced to continue making loan \npayments on a car that is not is in his possession while paying additional costs associated with \nobtaining alternate transportation. \n9.  The District's policy of seizing vehicles pursuant to D.C's civil forfeiture statute \nwithout a prompt, post-deprivation opportunity to challenge the District's initial seizure and \ncontinued retention of the vehicle pending any potential forfeiture litigation violates Mr. \nSimms's right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n10.  The District's policy that forces indigent property owners to pay a \"penal sum\" \nbefore even being able to commence the legal process to challenge the police seizure of their \nproperty violates Mr. Simms's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \n11.  Mr. Simms seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n12.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, \net seq., and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 4 of 12\n13.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nParties \n14.  Plaintiff Frederick Simms is a 26-year-old resident of the District of Columbia. \n15.  Mr. Simms was determined to be indigent and was represented by the Public \nDefender Service of the District of Columbia in his criminal matter.  Mr. Simms was acquitted of \nall charges after a jury trial. \n16.  Mr. Simms is employed by AAAA Storage in Sterling, Virginia.  He has worked \nthere for nearly four years. \n17.  Mr. Simms has a 11-month-old daughter, whom he raises with his fiancee. \n18.  Defendants did not provide Mr. Simms with a prompt, post-deprivation hearing \nto challenge the validity of the initial seizure of Mr. Simms's car.  Moreover, at no time did Mr. \nSimms have the opportunity to ask a neutral decisionmaker for the return of his car pending the \nforfeiture proceedings, and at no point was the District required to justify continued retention of \nthe car pending any potential litigation. \n19.  Defendants have required that Mr. Simms pay the police an $800 bond in order to \nchallenge the forfeiture of his car despite the fact that he cannot afford that requirement. \nDefendants' policy is to refrain from beginning forfeiture proceedings until an owner pays the \nbond, and the statute permits defendants to dispose of the vehicle if the bond is not paid within \n30 days. \n20.  Vincent Gray is the Mayor of the District of Columbia and is responsible for \nimplementing the policies of the District of Columbia as they relate to property seized by District \npolice officers pursuant to the District's statutory civil forfeiture scheme.  He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 5 of 12\n21.  Cathy Lanier is the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of \nColumbia and is responsible for executing the policies of the District of Columbia as they relate \nto property seized by District police officers pursuant to the District's statutory civil forfeiture \nscheme.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n22.  The District of Columbia is the municipal entity employing the Mayor and the \nChief of the Metropolitan Police Department. \nFactual Background \nA.  Civil Forfeiture in the District of Columbia \n23.  Over the last several years, the MPD has seized and forfeited millions of dollars \nin private property.  D.C. law allows the MPD to keep much of the financial proceeds of the \nforfeitures that its officers pursue.  D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(4)(B). \n24.  Civil forfeiture in the District of Columbia is governed by the procedures set \nforth in D.C. Code § 48-905.02.1 \n25.  Under the civil forfeiture statute, seized property \"shall not be subject to replevin, \nbut is deemed to be in the custody of the Mayor.\"  D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(2). \n26.  Pursuant to District policy, after the MPD seizes a piece of private property, the \nMPD notifies the owner of the seized property that he or she is not permitted to challenge the \nseizure and forfeiture in court unless the person pays to the MPD a \"bond\" in the amount of 10% \nof the value of the property (as that value is determined by the police).  The bond, which the \nDistrict calls a \"penal sum,\" must be no less than $250 and no greater than $2,500.  D.C. Code§ \n48-905.02( d)(3)(B). \n1 There are several other statutory provisions pertaining to forfeiture.  Each of those employs the \nprocedures outlined in § 48-905.02, which is part of the District's laws pertaining to \"controlled \nsubstances.\"  Forfeiture of firearms is additionally covered by D.C. Code§ 7-2507.06a. \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 6 of 12\n27.  It is the policy and practice of the District of Columbia to begin no legal process \nuntil the bond is paid. \n28.  It is the policy and practice of the District of Columbia to make no initial \nshowing of probable cause before a neutral and independent decisionmaker that the property is \nforfeitable, and to offer no justification before a neutral and independent decisionmaker for \nretaining possession of the vehicle during the pendency of the proceedings, notwithstanding the \nhardships suffered by owners deprived of their vehicles for months and the availability of \nalternative, less restrictive means to protect the District's interests. \n29.  It is the policy and practice of the Metropolitan Police Department to require \nclaimants to pay the \"penal\" bond.  Though a claimant may apply for waiver or reduction of the \nbond if he or she is indigent, it is wholly within the discretion of individual officers of the \nMetropolitan Police Department whether to grant a waiver or reduction in the bond.  According \nto FOIA disclosures, the MPD does not have any standard procedures requiring officers to notify \nowners that the bond can be waived or reduced for the indigent.  Nor does MPD have any formal \nstandards regarding how indigence is to be determined. \n30.  Once the bond is paid, the District of Columbia will wait months before \ninitiating the legal process in Superior Court to forfeit the vehicle. \n31.  Once the District of Columbia initiates proceedings by filing a Libel of \nInformation seeking forfeiture, the claimant, who is not provided with an attorney, is forced to \nlitigate the civil action on his or her own if he or she cannot afford a lawyer, including filing an \nanswer, engaging in civil discovery and, ultimately, conducting a trial.  At trial, the evidentiary \nburden is placed on the individual property owner to prove that his or her property is not subject \nto forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence.  D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(3)(G). \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 7 of 12\n32.  Although D.C. law provides that \"[a]n innocent owner's interest in a conveyance \nwhich has been seized shall not be forfeited ... \",D.C. Code§ 7-2507.06a(c); D.C. Code§ 48-\n905.02(a)(7)(A), at no point before the civil forfeiture trial-which can take place months or \nyears after the seizure-are owners given any opportunity to demonstrate that they are \n\"innocent.\"  An innocent owner in D.C. thus cannot promptly challenge the judgment of the \npolice officer who decided on the scene that his or her car should become property of the \nDistrict. \n33.  The MPD has a direct financial stake in erecting obstacles in front of claimants \nseeking return of their property.  The proceeds from seizing private property go to paying the \nMPD's expenses, including seizure operations themselves.  D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(4)(B). \nMoreover, the leftover proceeds \"shall be used, and shall remain available until expended \nregardless of the expiration of the fiscal year in which they were collected, to finance law \nenforcement activities of the Metropolitan Police Department ....\"   /d. \nB.  The Seizure of Mr. Simms's Vehicle \n34.  Officers seized Mr. Simms's car after they claimed to find a firearm in a bag \ninside the vehicle on May 29, 2011.  The car was taken to the MPD's impound lot in Southwest \nD.C. \n35.  Mr. Simms was charged with one count of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm \npursuant to D.C. Code § 22-4503(a)(l), one count of Carrying a Pistol Without a License \npursuant to D.C. Code § 22-4504(a), one count of Possession of an Unregistered Firearm \npursuant to D.C. Code§ 7-2502.01, and one count of Unlawful Possession of Ammunition \npursuant to D.C. Code§ 7-2506.01(3). \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 8 of 12\n36.  Mr. Simms was determined by the court to be indigent, and he was appointed a \ntrial attorney from the Public Defender Service. \n37.  Mr. Simms was acquitted of all charges on December 7, 2011, after a jury trial in \nthe Superior Court for the District of Columbia. \n38.  That same day, Mr. Simms went to the MPD impound lot seeking return of his \ncar.  A police officer informed Mr. Simms that he would be required to pay a bond of over \n$1,200 in order to challenge the MPD's decision to take possession of his car.  However, \npayment of this bond, he was told, would not actually result in return of his vehicle because his \nvehicle was subject to civil forfeiture. \n39.  No officer informed Mr. Simms that the bond would be waived or reduced if he \nwere indigent. \n40.  After finding out that he could file for a waiver of the bond on the ground of \nindigence, Mr. Simms submitted an application for waiver with the MPD.  When he arrived at \nthe impound lot, he was told by an MPD officer to get his application notarized and to return \nwith three years of tax returns.  Mr. Simms got the application notarized and obtained and \nattached copies of his tax returns from 2009, 2010, and 2011.  He submitted the required \ndocuments on March 19, 2012.  For about two weeks he heard nothing.  Finally, he went back to \nthe police station and was informed that his bond would be reduced to $800. \n41.  Because Mr. Simms cannot afford either amount, the civil proceedings to \ndetermine whether his vehicle is forfeitable under the statute cannot begin, and his vehicle is in \ndanger of being declared forfeited.  See D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(3)(C). \nC.  Mr. Simms's Reliance on His Vehicle \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 9 of 12\n42.  Mr. Simms depended on his vehicle in order to fulfill his obligations to his job \nand to his family.  In the absence of his vehicle, he has been forced to rent cars, use public \ntransportation, and take taxicabs in order to fulfill those obligations, at great personal difficulty \nand financial cost. \n43.  Before his car was seized, Mr. Simms lived in Southeast D.C. with his mother. \nThe deprivation of his car forced him temporarily to relocate to Northern Virginia, in order to be \ncloser to work.  He has now had to move back to Southeast D.C. and again confronts a daily \ncommute that involves taking a bus to the Anacostia Metro station, a train to L'Enfant Plaza, a \nbus to a Park & Ride in Herndon, VA near Dulles Airport, and then a ride from a coworker or a \ncab to his job in Sterling, VA.  This commute takes a total of an hour-and-a-half to two hours \neach way every day and can cost a total of $40. \n44.  Mr. Simms is an assistant manager at AAAA Storage.  His job, which requires \nhim to travel to various AAAA Storage locations, is threatened by his lack of access to a vehicle. \nOn days on which he is required to travel to a location not readily accessible by public \ntransportation, he has had to rent cars to keep his job, despite the fact that the car rental fees \noften approximate his daily wages.  Mr. Simms earns $12 per hour. \n45.  Mr. Simms has also experienced difficulties raising his 11-month-old child, \nincluding being able to take her to daycare every day, as she requires, being able to take her to \nmedical and other necessary appointments, and being able to buy groceries and other necessities \nfor the family. \nD.  Mr. Simms's Financial Hardship and Application for A Waiver of the Bond \n46.  Mr. Simms cannot afford to pay the \"penal sum\" of $800.  Between child care \ncosts, transportation costs, payments on his car loan, rent, and other monthly expenses, he is \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 10 of 12\nunable to afford the sum required before the District may even begin legal proceedings in his \npotential civil forfeiture case. \n47.  The decision by an MPD officer not to waive Mr. Simms's bond was not \nexplained or justified. \nE.  No A venue of Relief is Available to Mr. Simms \n48.  Because Mr. Simms cannot pay the bond, the District of Columbia may treat his \nvehicle as forfeited under the statute. \n49.  Mr. Simms has no other legal remedy to seek the return of his car.  The asset \nforfeiture statute bars all actions for replevin. D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(2). \n50.  The asset forfeiture statue provides no process for claimants seeking to challenge \nthe seizure of their property or its continued retention, other than the proceedings instituted by \nthe Attorney General upon the payment of the \"penal sum.\" \nClaims for Relief \nOne:  The Seizure and Continued Retention of Mr. Simms's Vehicle Without a \nPrompt, Post-Deprivation Hearing Before A Neutral Decision-Maker Violates \nProcedural Due Process. \n51.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-50 above. \n52.  The District of Columbia has deprived Mr. Simms of procedural due process \nunder the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to provide a prompt post-\ndeprivation hearing at which the District is required to make before a neutral decisionmaker the \nstatutory showing of probable cause to seize the vehicle, and at which the District is required to \njustify the MPD' s continued retention of the vehicle pending any potential civil forfeiture \nproceedings. \nTwo: Requiring Mr. Simms, Who is Indigent, To Pay A Sum In Order to \nChallenge the Seizure of His Vehicle Violates Due Process. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 11 of 12\n53.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-52 above. \n54.  The District of Columbia deprived Mr. Simms of his rights under the Fifth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution by requiring him, an indigent claimant, to pay a \nsubstantial \"penal sum\" in order to commence a challenge to the taking of his vehicle by police. \nThree:  The Mayor and the MPD's Financial Conflict of Interest in Asset \nForfeitures Violates Due Process. \n55.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-54 above. \n56.  Because the Metropolitan Police Department and the Mayor have a financial \nstake in the outcome of asset forfeiture proceedings, their decisionmaking power over Mr. \nSimms's indigence and bond determination, as well as their decision to seize and retain his \nvehicle pending any civil forfeiture proceedings, violates due process under the Fifth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nRequest for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court issue a judgment against Defendants: \na.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants from retaining Mr. Simms's \nvehicle unless and until Defendants provide the process required by the Fifth \nAmendment; \nb.  Declaring that due process requires a vehicle owner like Mr. Simms to be provided a \nprompt post-seizure hearing at which the owner can contest the validity of the initial \nseizure and the validity of the District's continued retention of the vehicle pending \nany forfeiture litigation; \nc.  Declaring that the District's policy resulting in requiring indigent property owners to \npay a \"penal sum\" before the District initiates any civil forfeiture proceedings violates \nthe Fifth Amendment; \nd.  Declaring that Defendants' financial interest in civil forfeiture renders Defendants' \ndecisionmaking with respect to the seizure and retention of private property \nconstitutionally infirm under the Fifth Amendment; and \ne.  Granting any other relief this Court deems just and proper. \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00701-EGS   Document 1   Filed 05/01/12   Page 12 of 12\nRespectfully submitted, \ng_  Mioe__ \nJ~ \nTM \nSandra K.
