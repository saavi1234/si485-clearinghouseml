    "summary": "<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1881a et seq., permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008]</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2015, the Government submitted to the FISC certifications executed by the AG and the acting DNI under Section 702 of FISA. Each of these certifications generally proposed to continue acquisitions of intelligence information that were being conducted under the 2014 certifications. The 2014 certifications re-authorized certifications dating back to 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hogan reviewed the proposed targeting and minimization procedures, which incorporated several modifications. A number of these modifications implemented recommendations made by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) in its 2014 report on the Section 702 program. These modifications to the targeting and minimization procedures included:</p>\r\n<p>1. Codifying the existing requirement that NSA must make a particularized, fact-based assessment that each target is expected to possess, receive, or communicate foreign intelligence information and requiring documentation regarding this assessment;</p>\r\n<p>2. Enhancing the protection for attorney-client communications in the NSA, CIA, and FBI minimization procedures;</p>\r\n<p>3. Clarifying documentation or other requirements with respect to the querying of Section 702 information using the identifier of a United States person.</p>\r\n<p>Before making the July 15, 2015 Submission, the Government had filed draft versions of the 2015 certifications on June 15, 2015. After reviewing those drafts, the FISC had concluded that the &ldquo;matter was likely to present one or more novel or significant interpretations of the law,&rdquo; and that it would likely require the FISC to appoint an amicus curiae. On August 13, 2015, the FISC (it is unclear which particular FISC judge appointed the amicus because the document is not available), utilizing a new provision of FISA enacted as part of the USA FREEDOM Act, appointed Amy Jeffress (a private lawyer, formerly counsel to Attorney General Eric Holder on national security matters) as amicus curiae to offer further analysis on two interpretations of law.</p>\r\n<p>First, Ms. Jeffress was addressed whether the ability to query Section 702-acquired information using a United States person identifier was consistent with FISA and the Fourth Amendment. After extensive scrutiny and consideration of Ms. Jeffress&rsquo;s views, Judge Hogan reaffirmed his analysis that the querying provisions, which permit the use of United States person identifiers to identify both foreign intelligence information and, in the case of the FBI, evidence of a crime, comply with both the statute and the Constitution. Because the procedures allow for queries seeking both foreign intelligence information and evidence of a crime, the Court focused in particular on the FBI&rsquo;s query provisions. Judge Hogan disagreed with Jeffress&rsquo;s argument that these procedures would allow searches unrelated to national security, holding that the foreign intelligence national security need not be the sole purpose of searches of &sect; 702 as long as it is a significant purpose. He reasoned that because the FBI acquires its information from the NSA, the NSA&rsquo;s prior particularized assessment of each target&rsquo;s likelihood of receipt or possession of foreign intelligence was sufficient to eliminate the risk of searches yielding unrelated results. Ultimately, Judge Hogan determined that these provisions struck a reasonable balance between the privacy interests and the government&rsquo;s national security interests.</p>\r\n<p>Second, Ms. Jeffress was appointed to assess provisions in the minimization procedures designed to preserve for litigation purposes communications otherwise subject to destruction. The FISC had previously encouraged the government to consider revising these provisions to address preservation of information with more standardized rules, and the government responded by modifying provisions in the NSA and CIA minimization procedures which are included but redacted in the memo. Judge Hogan now held that these modified provisions met the requirements of &sect; 1801(h) and struck a reasonable balance between retention limits in FISA, and the government&rsquo;s need to comply with litigation obligations.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, in the course of the Fourth Amendment analysis the FISC conducts each time it reviews a Section 702 certification, Judge Hogan assessed the Government&rsquo;s record of compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures in the prior year. As part of this review, he considered several compliance incidents, individually analyzing several incidents in detail.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, Judge Hogan described prior redacted incidents where FBI case agents knew that targets faced federal criminal charges but failed to establish required review teams with no role in the target&rsquo;s prosecution. The FISC had previously responded to the high rate of noncompliance by requiring written assessments of training, guidance, and oversight regarding attorney client communications. Judge Hogan now concluded that he was satisfied with the government&rsquo;s updated procedures.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hogan ultimately determined that his &ldquo;overall assessment of the implementation of, and compliance with, the targeting and minimization procedures permits a finding that these procedures, as implemented, satisfy the applicable statutory requirements.&rdquo;</p>",

For the reasons explained below, the government's request for \napproval is granted, subject to certain reporting requirements.  The Court's approval of the \ncertifications, amended certifications, and accompanying targeting procedures and minimization \nprocedures is set out in a separate order that is being entered contemporaneously herewith. \nTOP S:EC:RiBTHSINORCONfNOFOR:N \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The 2015 Certifications \nThe July 15, 2015 Submission includes. rti:ficalions that have been executed by the \nAttorney General (\"AG\") and the Acting Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\") pursuant to \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), which is codified at 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a : \nEach of th- certifications (collectively referred to as \"the 2015 \nCertifications\") is accompanied by the supporting affidavits of the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency (\"NSA\"), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\"); two sets of targeting procedures, for use by \nthe NSA and FBI respectively;1 and four sets ofrrunimization procedures, for use by the NSA, \nFBI, CIA, and the National Counterterrorism Center (\"NCTC\"), respectively.2  The July 15,2015 \nSubmission also includes an explanatory memorandum prepared by the Department of Justice \n1 The targetjng procedures for each of the 2015 Certifications are identical.  The targeting \nprocedures for the NSA (\"NSA Targeting Procedures\") appear as Exhibit A to each of the 2015 \nCertifications.  The targeting procedures for the FBI (\"FBI Targeting Procedures\") appear as \nExhibit C to each of the 2015 Certifications. \n2  The minin1ization procedures for each of the 2015 Certifications are identical.  The \nminimization procedures for the NSA (\"NSA Min..imization Procedures\") appear as Exhibit B to \neach of the 2015 Certifications.  The minimization procedures for the FBI (\"FBI Minimization \nProcedures\") appear as Exhibit D to each of the 2015 Certifications.  The minimization \nprocedures for the CIA (\"CIA Minimization Procedures>') appear as Exhibit E to each of the \n2015 Certifications.  Tbe minimization procedures for the NCTC (\"NCTC Minimization \nProcedures\") appear as Exhibit G to each of the 2015 Certifications. \nTOP SHCR:ETNSIJYORCOP<fNOFOR:N  Page2 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n(\"DOJ\") (\"July 15,2015 Memorandum\").  Finally, it includes an unclassified swnmary ofDOJ \nand DNl oversight of Section 702 implementation, and a summary of \"notable Section 702 \nrequirements,\" which have been submitted to the Court in accordance with the recommendation \nof the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board ('.PCLOB\").

See July 15, 2015 Memorandum at 2.  The 2014 Certifications, \napproved by the FISC on August 26, 2014.3  The 2014 Certifications, in twn, generally renewed \nauthorizations to acquire foreign intelligence infonnation under a series of certifications made by \nthe AG and DNI pursuant to Section 702 that dates back to 2008.4  In its July 15, 2015 \nSubmission, the government also seeks approval of amendments to the certifications in all of the \nPrior 702 Dockets, such that the NSA, CIA, and FBI henceforward will apply the same \nminimization procedures to information obtained under prior certifications as they will to \ninformation to be obtained under the 2015 Certifications.  See July 15 Memorandwn at 2-3; \nMemorandum Opinion \n5  The July 15,2015 Submission does not propose any changes to the FBI Targeting \nProcedures or NCTC Minimization Procedures.  See July 15,2015 Memorandum at 3. \nPage4 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nB.  The Extension of Time and the Appointment of Amicus Curiae \nBefore making the July 15, 2015 Submission, the government filed draft versions of the \n2015 Certiftcations on June 15, 2015.  After reviewing those drafts, the Court concluded \"that \nthis matter is likely to present one or more novel or significant interpretations of the law, which \nwould require the Court to consider appointment of an amkus curiae\" under 50 U.S.C. § \n1803(i)(2).  See Order issued on July 7, 2015 (\"July 7, 2015 Order\"), at 3. The Court further \nnoted that the 30-day review period specified by 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(l)(B) would, as a practical \nmatter, foreclose amicus participation.  Id. The Court may, however, extend that 30-day review \nperiod \"as necessary for good cause in a manner consistent with national security.\" 50 U.S.C. § \n1881a (j)(2). \nTo help the Court decide \"whether to extend the time it would have to act on the 2015 \nCertifications and revised procedures in order to allow for meaningful amicus assistance in \nreviewing them,\" the Court ordered the government to \"explain in writing whether - and if so, \nhow long-an extension of the time for the Court to review the 2015 Certifications and revised \nprocedures would be consistent with national security.\"  July 7, 2015 Order at 4. On July 14, \n201 5, the Government timely filed its Response to the July 7, 2015 Order, advisjng that \"the \ngovernment assesses that an extension of 60 to 90 days ... would be consistent witl1 national \nsecurity.\"  See Government's Response to the Court's Order ofJuly 7, 2015, filed on July 14, \n2015, at 7. \nOn July 23, 2015, the Court found that \"the need for an extension to allow for [amicus] \nparticipation constitutes 'good cause\"' for an extension under Section 1881aG)(2).  See Order \nTOP SECll-E~fi'Bih'OftCONi'NOFORf'~  Page 5 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nissued on July 23, 2015, at 3.  Accordingly, it extended \"the period for Court review under \n[Section 1881 a(i)(l )(B)] for 90 days, such that this review must be completed no later than \nNovember 12, 2015.\" Id. \nOn August 13, 2015, the Court issued an order appointing Amy Jeffress to serve as \namicus curiae in this matter pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2)(B).6  The Court directed Ms. \nJeffress to address whether the rrunimization procedures accompanying the 2015 Certifications \nmeet the requirements of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e) and are consistent with the Fourth Amendment, \nsee id. § 1881a(i)(3)(A), in view of the provisions of the procedures that apply to: \n(i) queries ofinfom:lation obtained under section 702, particularly insofar as \nqueries may be designed to return information concerning United States persons, \nsee NSA Minimization Procedures at 7, FBI Minimization Procedures at 11-12, \nand CIA Minimization Procedures at 3-4; and \n(ii) preservation for litigation purposes of information otherwise required to be \ndestroyed under the minimization procedures, see NSA Minimization Procedures \nat 8-9, FBI Minimization Procedures at 24-25, and CIA Minimization Procedures \nat 10-11. \nThereafter, the Court issued an order directing Ms. Jeffress and the government to submit \nbriefs on these issues no later than October 16, 2015.  See Briefing Order issued on September \n16, 2015, at 4.  After both briefs were t1mely filed, the Court received oral argument from the \n6 The Court wishes to thank Ms. Jeffress for her exemplary work in this matter.

Review of Compliance Issues \nFISC review of targeting and minimization procedures under Section 702 is not confined \nto the procedures as written; rather, the Court also examines how the procedures have been and \nwill be implemented. See,  Memorandum Opinion entered on \nApril 7, 2009, at 22-24 (\"April 7, 2009  and \nMemorandum Opinion entered on Aug. 30,2013, at 6-11 (\"August 30,2013 \nOpinion\").  Accordingly, for purposes of its review of the July 15, 2015 Submission, the Court \nhas examined quarterly compliance reports submitted by the government8 since the most recent \nFISC review of Section 702 certifications and procedures was completed on August 26,2014, as \nwell as individual notices of non-compliance relating to implementation of Section 702. Based \non its review of these submissions, the Court, through its staff, orally conveyed a number of \ncompliance-related questions to the government.  On October 8, 2015, the Court conducted a \nhearing to address some of the same compliance-related questions (\"October 8 Hearing\"). \nII.

Dempsey, \nthe Deputy DNI for Intelligence Integration.  At the time, Mr. Dempsey was serving as Acting \nDNI pursuant to a Presidential Memorandwn dated September 20, 2013.  That Memorandum, \nwhich was issued pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, as amended, 5 U.S.C. § \n3345, et seq., provides that the Deputy DNI for Intelligence Integration \"shall act as and perform \nthe functions and duties of the [DNI] during any period in which the DNI and the Principal \nDeputy Director of National Intelligence have died, resigned, or otherwise become unable to \nperform the functions and duties of the DNI.\"  See Presidential Memorandum, \"Designation of \nOfficers of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [(\"ODNI\")] to Act as Director of \nNational Intelligence,\" 78 Fed.

Id.12 \nIll.  R.EVJEW OF THE TARGETING AND MINHviiZATION PROCEDURES \nThe Court is also required, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 188la(i)(2)(B) and (C), to review the \ntargeting and minimization procedures to determine whether they are consistent with the \nrequirements of 50 U.S.C. § 188la(d)(l) and (e)(l).  Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § I88la(i)(3)(A), the \nCourt further assesses whether the targeting and minimization procedures are consistent ~rith the \nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment. \nSection 1881a(d)(l) requires targeting procedures that are \"reasonably designed\" to \n\"ensure that any acquisition authorized under [the certification] is limited to targeting persons \nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional \nacquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are knov.'ll at \nthe time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\"  In addition to these statutory \n11 The statement described in 50 U.S.C. § 188la(g)(2)(E) is not required in this case \nbecause there has been no \"exigent circumstances\" determination under Section 1881 a( c) (2). \n12  The effective dates for the amendments to the certifications in the Prior 702 \nSee \nTQP SISCR+J'IW81//0:RE01tlf#8178Rfq  Page 9 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nrequirements, the government uses the targeting procedures as a means of complying with \nSection 1881a(b)(3), which provides that acquisitions ''may not intentionally target a United \nStates person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\" See NSA Targeting \nProcedures at 1, 3-4, 7; FBI Targeting Procedures at 1-4.  The FISC considers steps taken \npursuant to these procedw·es to avoid targeting United States persons as relevant to its \nassessment of whether the procedures are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth \nAmendment.  See Docket No. 702(i)-08-01, Memorandtun Opinion entered on Sept. 4, 2008, at \n14 (\"September 4, 2008 Opinion\"). \nSection 188la( e)(l) requires minimization procedures that \"meet the definition of \nminimization procedures under [50 U.S.C. §§] 180l(h) or 1821(4)].\" The applicable statutory \ndefinition is fully set out at pages 12-14 below. \nA.  The NSA and FBI Targeting Procedures Complv With Statutory Requirements \nand Are Reasonably Designed to Prevent the Targeting of United States Persons \nUnder the procedures adopted by the government, NSA is the lead agency in making \ntargeting decisions under Section 702.  Pursuant to its targeting procedures, NSA may target for \nacquisition a particular \"selector,\" which is typically a facility such as a telephone number or \nemail address.  The FBI Targeting Procedures come into play in cases where the government \nhas been tasked under the NSA \nTargeting Procedures.  See FBI Targeting Procedures at 1.  \"Thus, the FBI Targeting Procedures \nacquired.\" September 4, 2008 Opinion at 20 (emphasis in original). \n't'OP SECRE'ff/StfJORCONfN61'6ItN  Page 10 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nThe NSA Targeting Procedures included as part of the July 1S , 2015 Submission contain \ntwo revisions, neither of which raises any concern. Both changes concern the requirement that, \nbefore tasking a selector for collection under Section 702, NSA first assess that the target is \nexpected to possess or receive, or is likely to communicate, foreign intelligence information \nconcerning a foreign power or a foreign territory.  See NSA Targeting Procedures at 4.  The frrst \nchange consists of new language clarifying that such assessments must be \"particularized and \nfact-based\" and must consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\"  See id.  The new language, \nwhich was added following a recommendation of the PC LOB, see PCLOB Report at 134-35  \n(Recommendation 1) , results in no change in practice, as NSA bas interpreted prior versions of \nthe procedures to require the same particularized, fact-based assessments of the totality ofthe \ncircumstances.  See July 15.2015 Memorandum at 5-6. \nThe second change, made in response to the same PCLOB recommendation, is the \naddition of language requiring NSA analysts to document each such foreign intelligence \nassessment.  New language requires NSA analysts to \"provide a written explanation of the basis \nfor their assessment, at the time of targeting, that the target possesses, is expected to receive, \nand/or is likely to commwucate foreign intelligence information concerning [the] foreign power \nor foreign territory\" about which they expect to obtain foreign intelligence information pursuant \nto a particular targeting detem1ination. See NSA Targeting Procedures at 8.  This change, which \nwill facilitate review and oversight ofNSA targeting decisions, presents no issue under Section \n188la(d)(1). \nFor the reasons stated above and in the Court's opinions in the Prior 702 Dockets, the \n~OP ~CRE'fWSI/IORCON~6f61tN  Page 11 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f'6P StteH'f';¥SI//6lt€6N/N6f6:1tf{ \nCourt concludes that the NSA Targeting Procedures and the FBI Targeting Procedures, 13 as \nwritten, are reasonably designed, as required by Section 188la(d)(l): (1) to ensure that any \nacquisition authorized under the 2015 Certifications is limited to targeting persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States, and (2) to prevent the intentional acquisition of \nany communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of \nthe acquisition to be located in the United States.  Moreover, for the reasons stated above and in \nthe Court's opinions in the Prior 702 Dockets, the Court concludes that the NSA and FBI \nTargeting Procedures, as written, are reasonably designed to prevent United States persons from \nbeing targeted for acquisition-a fmding that is relevant to the Court's analysis of whether those \nprocedures are consistent with the reqillrements of the Fourth Amendment.  See pages 36~45 \nbelow. \nB.  Tbe FBI, NSA. and CIA Minimization Procedures Comply With Statutorv \nRequirements \nThe FBI, NSA, and CIA all have access to \"raw,\" or unminimized, information obtained \nunder Section 702.  Each agency is governed by its own set of minimization procedures in its \nhandling of Section 702 information.  Under Section 1881 a(i)(2)(C), the Court must determine \nwhether the agencies' respective minimization procedures included as part of the July 15, 2015 \nSubmission meet the statutory definition of minit:nization procedmes set forth at 50 U.S.C. §§ \n1801(h) or 1821(4), as appropriate.  Sections 1801(h) and 1821(4) defme \"minimization \n13  The Court has already concluded that procedures identical to the FBI Targeting \nProcedures included as part of the July 15, 2015 Submission comply with the applicable statutory \nrequirements.  See August 26, 2014 Opinion at 12-14. There is no basis for the Court to deviate \nfrom that conclusion here. \n'f'8P SIBC~'f'#Sil/6RC8PHN81'6RN  Page 12 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n1'8P \nSt?JC~'tW815¥8lt€8fi/ft8F6ftff \nprocedures\" in pertinent part as: \n(I) specific procedures, which shall be adopted by the Attorney General, that are \nreasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular \nsurveillance [or physical search], to minimize the acquisition and retention, and \nprohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning \nunconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the United States \nto obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence infonnation;['4\n] \n(2) procedures that require that nonpublicly available information, which is not \nforeign intelligence information, as defined in [50 U.S.C. § 180l(e)(l)), shall not \nbe disseminated in a manner that identifies any United States person, without such \nperson's consent, unless such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence infonnation or assess its importance; [and] \n(3) notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), procedures that allow for the retentjon \nand dissemination of information that is evidence of a crime which has been, is \nbeing, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated for \nlaw enforcement purposes[.] \n14  Section 1801( e) defines \"foreign intelligence information\" as \n(1) information that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is \nnecessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against-\n(A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power \nor an agent of a foreign power; \n(B) sabotage, international terrorism, or the international proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower; or \n(C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network \nof a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign power; or \n(2) information with respect to a foreign power or a foreign territory that relates to, and if \nconcerning a United States person is necessary to -\n(A) the national defense or the security of the United States; or \n(B) the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States. \n'FOP S@CRfi'fHS:f/J8RCONIN8FORN  Page 13 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'i'OP SFJCRE~f/SitiORCONiNOFORf( \nSO U.S.C. § 1801(h); seealsoid. § 1821(4).15 \n1.  Changes to Provisions Permitting the Retention of Section 702-Acquired \nInformation Subject to Preservation Obligations Arising from Litigation \nIn 2014, the Court approved provisions permitting FBI, NSA and CIA to retain Section \n702-acquired information subject to specific preservation obligations arising in litigation \nconcerning the lawfulness of Section 702.  See August 26,2014 Opinion at 21-25.  Access to \ninformation retained under these provisions is tightly restricted. See id. at 21, 23.  The revised \nNSA and CIA !v1inimization Procedures accompanying the 2015 Certifications contain revisions \nto these \"litigation hold\" provisions. \nThe litigation hold provisions currently in effect allow NSA and CIA to retain specific \nSection 702-acquired information that is otherwise subject to age-offl6 if DOJ has advised either \nagency in writing that such information is subject to a preservation obligation in pending or \nanticipated administrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  See id. at 22-23.  Those provisions also \nrecognize that litigation preservation obligations can also apply to Section 702-acquired \ninformation that is subject to destruction for reasons other than the age-off requirements of the \nprocedures - M:, domestic communications subject to destruction under Section 5 of the NSA \n15  The definitions of\"minimization procedures\" set forth in these provisions are \nsubstantively identical (although Section 1821(4)(A) refers to \"the purpose§. ... ofthe particular \nphysical search\") (e  mpha~is added). For ease of reference, subsequent citations refer only to the \ndefinition set forth at Section 1801(h). \n16  For example, the NSA generally may not retain telephony and certain forms of Internet \ncommunications for \"longer than five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection\" unless the NSA determines that certain specified retention criteria are \nmet.  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 7.  The CIA Minimization Procedures contain a \nsimilar reqi1irement.  See CTA Minimization Procedures at 2. \nTQP iildQIWT I 'il ';'Qia QQ}f '}JQPQil.ll  Page 14 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'fOf \nSIECH'fi/SI/lOltCOM/~OFOltN \nMinimization Procedures.  See id. at 23-24.  When such circumstances arise, the provisions \ncurrently in effect state that \"'the Government will notifY the [FISC] and seek permission to \nretain the material as appropriate [and] consistent with the law.\"' See id. (quoting 2014 \nprocedures). The Court encouraged the government to consider further revision of the \nprocedures to address such circumstances with generally applicable rules rather than on a \npiecemeal basis.  See id. at 24. \nIn response to this suggestion, the government has modified the language in the NSA and \n'F8P SEEIM3'THSI/181UJ8PiA'f8F'8Rl'f  Page 15 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f6P SECRE'f//Sti/6RC6NfN6F'6Rf~ \nThe Court agrees with amicus curiae Amy Jeffress that the revised litigation hold \nprovisions comport with the requirements of Section 180l(h) and strike a reasonable and \nappropriate balance between the retention limitatjons reflected in FISA and the government's \nneed to comply with its litigation-related obligations. See Brief of Amicus Curiae submitted on \nOctober 16,2015, at 28-34 (\"Amicus Brief'). \n2.  Provisions Restrkting the Retention and Use of Section 702-Acguired \nInformation Subject to the Attorney-Client Privilege \nThe revised FBI, NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures all include modifications to the \nprovisions restricting the use and dissemination of attorney-client communications that are \nacquired pursuant to Section 702.  The FBI Minimization Procedures include three such changes. \nThe procedures currently in effect include a provision permitting the FBI, after providing the \nPage 16 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'fOP SI!!Clti:5't=h'BIN8RC8N;'fi8F8:Rfi \noriginal copy of an attorney-client communication to DOJ for sequestration with this Court and \ndestroying other copies, to maintain a back-up copy that is subject to strict access controls.  See \nAugust 26, 2014 Opinion at 35. The first change to the FBI procedures clarifies that system \nadministrators and technical personnel may have access to such backup copies, but not for \nanalytical or operational purposes.  See FBI Minimization Procedures at 14.  The second change \nconsists of the addition of language requiring tbe FBI's Office of General Counsel to approve all \ndisseminations that include attorney-client privileged communications.  See id. at 17.  The new \nlanguage requires that before any such dissemination be made, reasonable efforts be undertaken \nto instead use other, non-privileged sources of information, and to tailor each dissemination to \nminimize or eliminate the disclosure of attorney-client privileged infonnation.  See id. at 17-18. \nThe third change is the addition of a requirement that all disseminations of attorney-client \nprivileged communications include language to advise recipients that the dissemination contains \ninformation subject to the attorney-client privilege, that the information is being disseminated \n\"solely for intelligence or lead purposes,\" and that it may not be further disseminated or used in \nany trial, hearing, or other proceeding without approval ofthe AG or the Assistant AG for \nNational Security.  See id. at 18. \nThe provisions of the NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures concerning attorney-client \ncommunications also have been modified.  The revised language requires, among other things, \ntbe destruction of at1omey-client communications that are affinnatively detem1ined not to \ncontain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.  See NSA Minimization \nProcedures at 10; CIA Mirumization Procedures at 5. \nPage 17 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nMoreover, disseminations of privileged \ninformation must contain an appropriate caveat to protect the information from being used in a \nlegal proceeding in the United States.  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 11; CIA \nMinimization Procedures at 7. \nThe revisions to the provisions of the FBI, NSA, and CIA Minimization Procedures \nconcerning attorney-client communications serve to enhance the protection of privileged \ninformation. The Court is satisfied that the changes present no concern under Section 1801(h). \n3.  Provisions of the FBI Minimization Procedures Pennitting the Retention \nof Back-up Copies and Encrypted Information \nThe government has added new language to the FBI Minimization Procedures to penn it \nthe retention of Section 702-acquired infonnation in \"backup and original evidence systems.\" \nPage 18 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f8P SE€Ri!YtYf8tH61tC6fVN6fi'61tf4 \nSee FBI Minimization Procedures at 24.  Only systems administrators and technical personnel \nmay have access to such systems and data in them may not be viewed or used for the purpose of \nintelligence analysis.  See id. Backup and original evidence systems are used to preserve copies \nof Section 702-acquired data in the form it was originally acquired.  See July 15, 2015 \nMemorandum at 16.  Such unaltered copies are unreadable without additional processing but can \nbe used in case of emergency ''to restore lost, destroyed, or inaccessible data,\" or to create an \n\"original evidence copy\" for evidentiary uses ~ to establish chain of custody in connection \nwith a criminal prosecution or to fulfill the government's criminal discovery obligations, see id. \nat 16-17).  See FBI Minimization Procedures at 24.  In the event backup and original evidence \nsystems are used to restore lost, destroyed, or inaccessible data, the FBI must apply its \nminimization proced~tres, including any applicable time limits on retention, to the restored data. \nSee id. \nThe government has also added a new provision to the FBI Minimization Procedures \npermitting the FBI to retain Section 702-acquired information that is encrypted or believed to \ncontain secret meaning for any period of time during which such material is subject to, or of use \nin, cryptanalysis or otherwise deciphering secret meaning.  See id. at 25.  Access to such \ninformation is restricted to FBI personnel engaged in cryptanalysis or deciphering secret \nmeaning.  See id.  Nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States \npersons retained under the provision cannot be used for any other purpose unless such use is \npennitted under a different provision of the minimization procedures.  See~ Once information \nretained m1der this provision is decrypted or its secret meaning is ascertained, the generally-\nTOP SECilST//SIN8RC8?ViSOFORN  Page 19 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\napplicable retention restrictions of the procedures apply, though the government has stated that it \nwill calculate the age-off date from the later of the date of decryption or the date of expiration of \nthe certification pursuant to which the information was acquired.  See July 15,2015 \nMemorandum at 18.19 \nNeither of these new provisions precludes the Cow1 fi·om finding that the FBI \nMinimization Procedures comport with Section 180l(h). Both are narrowly tailored to serve \nlegitimate government interests in a manner that appropriately protects nonpublicly available \ninformation conceming unconsenting United States persons. \n4.  Reporting Requirement for Disseminations to Private Entities or \nIndividuals \nThe version of the FBI Minimization Procedures that was approved by the Court in 2014 \nprovides that '\"information that reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, is \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance, or is evidence \nof a crime\"' may be disseminated to '\"a private individual or entity in situations where the FBI \ndetermines that said private individual or entity is capable of providing assistance in mitigating \nserious economic hann or serious harm to life or property.'\" See August 26, 2014 Opinion at 19 \n(quoting 2014 FBI Minimization Procedures at 33).  Wbenever reasonably practicable, such \ndisseminations must not include information identifying a United States person \"'unless the FBI \nreasonably believes it is necessary to enable the recipient to assist in the mitigation or prevention \nof the hann.,..  See id. (quoting 2014 FBI Minimization Procedures at 33).  Such disseminations \n19  To avoid confusion regarding the applicable age-off requirements, the government is \nencouraged to make this calculation methodology explicit in future versions of the procedures. \nPage 20 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP SHCFM!JTf/Slf/OR:CONfPiO-,Oftf~ \nmust be reported to DOJ within ten business days.  See id.  The government has retained the \nforegoing language but added language requiring that disseminations pursuant to this provision \nalso promptly be reported to the FISC.  See FBI Minimization Procedures at 37. This \nmodification does not alter the Court's conclusion that this provision of the procedures is \nconsistent with the requirements of Section 1801(h). See August 26, 2014 Opinion at 20. \n5.  Provisions Permitting Compliance with Specific Con')titutional. Judicial or \nLegislative Mandates \nThe NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures included as part ofthe July 15, 2015 \nSubmission each contain new language stating that \"[n]othing in these procedures shall prohibit \nthe retention, processing, or dissemination of information reasonably necessary to comply with \nspecific constitutional, judicial, or legislative mandates.\"  ~ NSA Minimization Procedures at \n1~ CIA Minimization Procedures at 4-5.  These provisions were not included in the draft \nprocedures that were submitted to the Court in June 20 15, but appear to have been added by the \ngovernment thereafter.  They are not discussed in the July 15, 2015 Memorandum. \nThe apparent breadth of these new provisions gives the Court pause.  As discussed above, \nthe applicable definition of \"minimization procedures\" requires, inter alig, \"specific procedures \n... that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique ofthe particular \nsurveillance, to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of \nnonpubJicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent ~1th \nthe need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence \ninformation.\" 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(l) (emphasis added).  In light of this requirement, the NSA \nPage 21 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTQP SE€RE'IWSII'/8RC8~i\"t8P81Ui \nand CIA Minimization Procedures contain page after page of detailed restrictions on the \nacquisition, retention, and dissemination, of Section 702~acquired information concerning United \nStates persons.  A provision that would allow the NSA and CIA to deviate from any of these \nrestrictions based upon unspecified \"mandates\" could undermine the Court's ability to find that \nthe procedures satisfy the above-described statutory requirement. \nIt appears, however, that the government does not intend to apply these provisions as \nbroadly as their language would arguably permit.  In 2012, the government proposed a similar \nprovision as part of minimization procedures to be applied by NCTC in handJing certain \nunminimized terrorism-related information acquired by FBI pursuant to other provisions of \nFISA.  In requesting approval of a provision that would allow NCTC personnel to deviate from \nother requirements of its minimization procedures when \"reasonably necessary to comply with \nspecific constitutional, judicial, or legislative mandates,\" the government asserted that \n\"Executive Branch orders or directives will not trigger this provision, nor will general \nCongressional directives that are not specific to information NCTC receives pursuant to this \nmotion.\"  Government's Submission of \nAmendments to Standard Minimization Procedures for FBI Electroiric Surveillance and Physical \nSearch Conducted Under FISA and Submissjon of Revised Minimization Procedures for the \nNCTC, submitted on April23, 2012, at 31-32.  The Court approved the NCTC rrunimization \nprocedures with the understanding that this provision would be applied sparingly.  The Court \ndescribed the provision as permitting NCTC personnel to \"retain, process or disseminate \ninformation when reasonably necessary to fulfill specific legal requirements\" and compared it to \nTOP SECRETh'Sits'ORCO~iQFORN  Page 22 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP 5ECRE1WSih'ORCONfNOFORN \na more narrowly-drafted provision of separate procedures that permits CLA. to retain or \ndisseminate information that is \"required by law to be retained or disseminated.\" \nMemorandum Opinion and Order issued on May 18, 2012, \nat J 1 (emphasis added). \nThe Court understands based on informal communications between the Court staff and \nattorneys for the government that NSA and CIA intend to apply the similar provisions at issue \nhere in the same narrow manner.  In any case, to avoid a deficiency under the above-described \ndefinition of \"minimization procedures,\" the Court must construe the phrase \"specific \nconstitutional, judicial, or legislative mandates\" to include only those mandates containing \nlanguage that clearly and specifically requires action in contravention of an otherwise-applicable \nprovision of the requirement of the minimization procedures.  Such clear and specific language, \nfor instance, might be found in a court order requiring the govenunent to preserve a particular \ntarget's communications beyond the date when they would otherwise be subject to age-off under \nthe minimization procedures. On the other band, these provisions should not be interpreted as \npennittiog an othenvise prohibited retention or use of information simply because that retention \nor use could assist the government in complying with a general statutory requirement, such as \nthose stated at 50 U.S.C. § 188la(b). To ensure that these provisions are being applied in a \nmanner consistent with the Court's understanding, the government will be directed to promptly \nreport any use thereof to the Court in writing, along with a written justification for each such \nPage 23 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'fOP SEClffi'fHSIHORCDr~'NOF6:RJ'{ \naction.  See page 78 below.20 \n6.  Provisions Concerning Queries ofinformation Acquired Through \nCollection Under Section 702 \nFinally, the NSA, CIA, and FBI Minimization Procedures included as part of the July 15, \n2015 Submission all include revised provisions concerning queries of unminimized data acquired \npursuant to Section 702.  The previously-approved minimization procedures for all three \nagencies permit appropriately-trained personnel with access to Section 702-acquired information \nto query repositories containing such information, subject to certain restrictions.  See PCLOB \nReport at 55.  The terms used to conduct such queries may in some circumstances include \ninformation concerning United States persons or otherwise be expected to return information \nabout a United States person.  See id. at 55-60. \na.  NSA and CIA querying provisions \nThe NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures accompanying the 2015 Certifications \ncontain several important restrictions that have been carried forward from prior versions of the \nprocedures.  Most notably, all terms used to query the contents of communications acquired \nthrough Section 702, such as phone numbers or key words, must be terms \"reasonably likely to \nreturn foreign intelligence information.\"  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 7; CIA \nMinimization Procedures at 3.  This requirement applies to all queries of Section 702-acquired \n20  The Court understands that the government may have added these new provisions to \nclarifY that information acquired under Section 702 may be shared with Members of Congress or \nCongressional committees in connection with Congressional oversight of the program.  If so, the \nCourt would urge the government to consider replacing these broadly-worded provisions with \nlanguage that is narrowly tailored to that purpose. \n'fOP SECRE'fHSih'ORCON/l'WF6Rf{  Page 24 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'F8P SI3CR£'P/JSI//8R:C81\"Mi8F8RN \ncontents, not just queries containing Uruted States-person identifiers.  See NSA Minimization \nProcedures at 7; CIA Minimization Procedures at 3.  Further, the NSA and CIA Minimization \nProcedures continue to require that both agencies maintain records of all United States-person \nidentifiers that are used to query Section 702 data and that such records be made available for \nmandatory review by DOJ and ODNI.  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 7; CIA \nMinimization Procedures at 3.21 \nIn addition, the NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures accompanying the 2015 \nCertifications now also mandate that NSA and CIA prepare \"a statement of facts establishing that \nthe use of any [United States-person] identifier as a selection term is reasonably designed to \nreturn foreign intelligence information as defined in FISA,\" see NSA Minimization Procedures at \n7; CIA Minimizat-ion Procedures at 3.  Like the records referred to above, these written \njustifications are provided to DOJ and ODNI to facilitate their oversight ofNSA and CIA \nqueries.  See July 15, 2015 Memorandum at 20-21.22 \n21  The NSA Minimjzation Procedures a]so continue to preclude United States-person \nqueries of its \"upstream collection.\"  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 7.

See \nMemorandum Opinion entered on October 3, 2011, at 5 n.3, 33-41 (\"October 3, 2011 Opinion\"). \nBecause only NSA receives '\"upstream collection,\" see id. at 18 n.l7, CIA and FBI are unable to \nquery information so acquired. \n22  Representatives of DOJ and ODNI conduct bi-monthly reviews at NSA and CIA to \nassess the agencies' compliance with the Section 702 targeting and minimization procedures. \nJuly 15, 2015 Memorandum, Tab 1 at 2, 4.

Nevertheless, adding these \ndocumentation requirements to the NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures serves to further \nreduce the risk that Section 702-acquired information concerning United States persons will be \nused, or even accessed, for improper purposes. l11e Court agrees with the government and Ms. \nJeffress23 that the revised querying provisions of the NSA and CIA Minimization Procedures are \nconsistent \\-vith the requirements of Section 1801 (h). \nb.

Analysis oft he FBI querying provisions \nAmicus curiae Amy Jeffress has raised concerns regarding the querying provisions of the \nFBI Minimization Procedures.  See Amicus Brief at 18-28.  Ms. Jeffress does not specifically \nassert that the querying provisions render the procedures inconsistent with the applicable \nstatutory definition of minimization procedures.  Nevertheless, she contends that the FBI \nMinimization Procedures \"go far beyond the purpose for which the Section 702-acquired \ninformation is collected in permitting queries that are unrelated to national security.\"  See id. at \n27( .•. continued) \nare illustrative and neither expand nor restrict the scope of the queries authorized in the \nlanguage above. \nFBI Minimization Procedures at 11 n.4; see also id. at 28 n.8 (similar language). \n28  The FBI ha<> adopted one policy change that is not reflected in its minimization \nprocedures.  The government has imposed additional limitations on the FBI's use of Section 702-\nacquired ini'(lrmation in connection with non-foreign intelligence criminal matters.  These \nlimitati.oos, which are reflected in the ODNI's Signals Intelligence Reform 2015 Anniversary \nReport, are described in the report as follows: \n[C]onsistent with the recommendation of the [PCLOB], information acquired llllder \nSection 702 about a U.S. person will not be introduced as evidence against that person in \nany criminal proceeding except (1) with the approval of the Attorney General, and (2) in \ncriminal cases with national security implications or certain other serious crimes.  This \nchange will ensure that, if [DOJ] decides to use information acquired under Section 702 \nabout a U.S. person in a criminal case, it will do so only for national security purposes or \nin prosecuting the most serious crimes. \nAmicus Brief at 17 (quoting http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/ppd-28/2015/privacy-civil \nliberties#section-702); see also id. at 18 (further describing policy). \n'f'8P SEC~'f'h'SI/J8ft:C8tt;'1i8F8RPi  Page 30 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n19.  The Court respectfully disagrees. \nTI1ere is no statutory requirement that all activities involving Section 702 data serve \nsolely a foreign intelligence national security purpose. To be sure, Section 702 was enacted to \npermit \"the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to \nacquire foreign intelligence information.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a) (emphasis added).  But even at \nthe time of acquisition, the statute does not require the government to have as its sole purpose \nobtaining foreign intelligence information.  Rather, the AG and DNI need certify only that \nobtaining foreign intelligence information is \"a significant purpose\" of the acquisition.  See id. § \n1881 a(g)(2 )(v ) (emphasis added). 29  Under the \"significant purpose\" standard, an acquisition \nunder Section 702 is permissible \"even if 'foreign intelligence' is only a significant-not a \nprimary -purpose\" of the targeting decision.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F .3d 717, 734 (FISA Ct. \nRev. 2002) (discussing 2001 amendment to Title I ofFISA permitting government to conduct \nelectronic surveillance based upon certification that obtaining foreign intelligence information is \na \"significant purpose of the su.rveillance\").30 \nNor does FISA foreclose any examination or use of information acquired pursuant to \nSection 702 that lacks a purpose relating to foreign intelligence.  It is true that the government's \n29  As d.i  d  b  h  f  h  d  :t  •  •  ·:~ •••• \npurpose.  See \n30  50 U.S.C. § 1804 (a)(6)(b)- the substance of which appeared in subsection \n1804(a)(7)(B) at the time of In reSealed Case-requires that each application for an order \napproving electronic surveillance under FISA contain a certification by a high-level Executive \nBranch official that, among other things, \"a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain \nforeign intelligence information.\" \n'T8P S~CMT//815'/8RC8N~J8fil8RN  Page 31 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nminimization procedw·es must be \"reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of \nthe [collection], to minimize the .. . retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly \navailable infonnation concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of \nthe United States to obtain. produce. and disseminate foreign intelligence information,\" 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801(h)(l) (emphasis added), and must limit the dissemination ofnonpublicly available \ninfonnation identifying unconsenting United States persons to certain circumstances, see id. § \n180l(h)(2).  Notwithstanding these requirements, however, FISA states that the minimization \nprocedures must also \"allow for the retention and dissemination of information that is evidence \nof a crime which has been, is being, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or \ndisseminated for law enforcement purposes.\"  Id. § 180l(h)(3).  Hence, FISA does not merely \ncontemplate, but expressly requires, that the government's procedures provide for the retention \nand dissemination of Section 702-acquired information that is evidence of crime for law \nenforcement purposes.  This requirement appJies whether or not the crime io question relates to \nforeign intelligence or national security.  See In reSealed Case, 310 F.3d at 731 (notv.ljthstanding \nrestrictions in subsections 1 801 (h)( 1) ·(2), subsection 1801 (h)(3) permits \"the retention and \ndissemination of non-foreign intelligence infi:mnation which is evidence of ordinary crimes for \npreventative or prosecutorial purposes\") (italics in original). \nMs. Jeffress acknowledges this statutory framework permits the retention and \ndissemination for law enforcement purposes of evidence of crimes that is discovered by queries \nof the Section 702-acquired data that are designed to find and extract foreign intelligence \ninformation. See October 20 Transcript at 10.  She suggests, however, that it restricts queries of \nTOP gi!JC:RET#Sih'ORCO:N;~NOFORN  Page 32 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'F8P SJ!11€ H!Yf'//Sih'8ftC6U;1t6F6ttl'\\ \nthe unminimized data- in particular those that are predicated on United States-person \ninformation- that are designed to elicit information about crimes unrelated to foreign \nintelligence.  See id.  But this distinction fmds no support in the statutory text.  Nothing in the \nstatute precludes the examination of infonnation that has otherwise been properly acquired \nthrough application of the targeting procedures and retained under the minimization procedures \nfor the purpose of finding evidence of crimes, whether or not those crimes relate to foreign \nintelligence. \nIt would be a strained reading of the definition of minimization procedure  to permit FBI \npersonnel to retain and disseminate Section 702 information constituting evidence of a crime \nimplicating a United States person for law enforcement purposes, but to prohibit them from \nquerying Section 702 data in a manner designed to identify such evidence.  And such an \ninterpretation would lead to anomalous results:  FBI personnel who came across one \ncommunication acquired under Section 702 that incriminates a United States person-perhaps \nbecause it was responsive to a query for foreign intelligence infonnation- would be prohibited \nfrom running queries tailored to identify additional communications obtained under Section 702 \npertaining to the same criminal activity, even though Section 1801 (h)(3) explicitly authorizes the \nretention and dissemination of such infonnation for law enforcement purposes. \nFinally, the Court respectfully disagrees with Ms. Jeffress' assertion that the FBI's \nquerying practices run afoul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ofRevicw's \nadmonition that \"'the FISA process cannot be used as a device to investigate wholly unrelated \nordinary crimes.\"' See Amicus Brief at 18 (quoting In reSealed Case, 310 F.3d at 736)). The \nTOP SBCRKT/iSWOR:CONJ'NOFOI@i  Page 33 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nCourt of Review made that statement in rejecting the government's contention that \"even \nprosecutions of non-foreign intelligence crimes are consistent with a purpose of gaining foreign \nintelligence information so long as the government's objective is to stop espionage or terrorism \nby putting an agent of a foreign power in prison.\"  See In reSealed Case. 310 F.3d at 735-736 \n(italics in original). The Court of Review concluded that it would be an \"~momalous reading\" of \nthe \"significant purpose\" lang11age of 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6)(B) to allow the use of electronic \nsurveillance in such a case.  See id. at 736.  The Court nevertheless stressed, however, that \"[s]o \nlong as the government entertains a realistic option of dealing with the agent other than through \ncriminal prosecution, it satisfies the significant purpose test.\" Id. at 735. \nThe FBI's use of queries designed to elicit evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign \nintelligence does not convert Section 702 acquisitions into \"a device to investigate wholly \numelate.d ordinary crimes.\" The FBI's querying provisions apply only to information that has \nbeen acquired following application of the NSA Targeting Procedures. As discussed above, \nthose targeting procedures require that before tasking a selector for collection, NSA first make a \nparticularized assessment, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the user of the selector \nis expected to possesses or receive, or is likely to communicate, foreign intelligence information \nconcerning a foreign power or a foreign territory.  See NSA Targeting Procedures at 4.  This \nrequirement ensures that at least a significant purpose of each targeting decision under Section \n702 is the acquisition of foreign intelligence information.  Queries of the data acquired through \napplication of this targeting process that are designed to elicit evidence of crjmes unrelated to \nforeign intelligence are therefore consistent with the \"significant purpose\" language of Section \nPage 34 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n1'8P \nSI3CRE~NSisV8ItC8tfl'ftt8F8RN \n1881a(g)(2)(A)(v). \nFinally, it must be noted that the FBI Minimization Procedures impose substantial \nrestrictions on the use and dissemination of information derived from queries that, taken \ntogether, ensure that the requirements of Section 1801( h) are satisfied. In the event that a query \nproduces a positive hit on Section 702-acquired information, the query results can only be \nviewed by FBI personnel who are appropriately trained and approved to handle such information \nand \"only for the purpose of determining whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its \nimportance, or to be evidence of a crime.\"  See FBI Minimization Procedures at 8.  Generally, \nother FBI personnel who have not been trained for and granted access to FISA-acquired \ninformation are not allowed to view the query results unJess the information has fast been \ndetermined by appropriately cleared personnel to meet one of those standards.  See FBI \nMinimization Procedures at 12 n.4.31  Information that is determined to meet one of those \ncriteria can be retained for further investigation and analysis and may be disseminated only in \naccordance with additional restrictions.  See id.; see also id. at 30-37.  Before using FISA-\nacquired information for further investigation, analysis, or dissemination, the FBI must strike, or \nsubstitute a characterization for, information of or concerning a United States person, including \nthat person's identity, if it does not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to \n31  In \"Very rare\" circumstances, see October 20 Transcript at 45, FBI pers01mel who are \nnot trained for and do not have access to Section 702-acquired information may view the results \nof a query solely to aid in the determination of whether the information constitutes foreign \nintelligence infom1ation or evidence of a crime.

See id. at 9. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the revised querying provisions of the \nFBI Minimization Procedures comport with the requirements of Section 1801(h).  Ms. Jeffress' \nconstitutional concerns about these provisions are addressed below. \n7.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above and in the Court's opinions in the Prior 702 Dockets, the \nCourt concludes that the NSA, FBI, and CIA Minimization Procedures satisfy the definition of \nminimization procedures at Section 1801(h). \nD.  The Targeting and Minimization Procedures Are Consistent with the Fourth \nAmendment \nThe Court next considers whether the targeting and minimization procedures included in \nthe July 15, 2015 Submission are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. \nSee 50 U.S. C.§ 1881a(i)(3)(A). \n1.  The Applicable Analyticall::ramework \nThe Fourth Amendment does not require the government to obtain a warrant to conduct \nsurveillance \"to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes [that] is directed against \nforeign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be I ocated outside the United \nStates.\" In re Directives Pursuant to Section 105B ofFISA, Docket No. 08-01, Opinion at 18-19 \n(FISA Ct. Rev. Aug. 22, 2008) (\"In re Directives\").32  This exception to the Fourth \n32  A declassified version of the opinion in ln re Directives is available at 551 F.3d 1004 \n(continued ...)  \nTOP SECRETh'SIHORCONfNOPORN  Page 36 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP SECRETHSI/fORCONINOFORN \nAmendment's warrant requirement applies even when a United States person is the target of such \na surveillance.  See id. at 25-26 (discussing internal Executive Branch criteria for targeting \nUnited States persons).  The FISC has previously concluded that the acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information pursuant to Section 702 falls within this \"foreign intelligence exception\" \nto the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.  See September 4, 2008 Opinion at 34-36; \naccord United States v.  Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749 at *15-18  (D. Or.  June 24, 2014). \nIt follows that the targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with the \nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment if those procedures, as implemented, are reasonable.  In \nassessing the reasonableness of a governmental intrusion under the Fourth Amendment, the court \nmust \"balance the interests at stake\" under the \"totality of the circumstances.\"  Id. at 20.  The \ncourt must consider \"the nature of the government intrusion and how the government intrusion is \nimplemented.  The more important the government's interest, the greater the intrusion that may \nbe constitutionally tolerated.\"  In re Directives at 19-20 (citations omitted). \nIf the protections that are in place for individual privacy interests are sufficient in \nlight of the governmental interest at stake, the constitutional scales will tilt in \nfavor of upholding the government's actions.  If, however, those protections are \ninsufficient to alleviate the risks of government error and abuse, the scales will tip \ntoward a finding of unconstitutionality. \nId. at 20. \nThe government's national security interest in conducting acquisitions pursuant to \nSection 702 '\"is of the highest order of magnitude.\"'  September 4, 2008 Opinion at 37 (quoting \n32 continued) \n( ... \n(FISA Ct. Rev. 2008). \n'i'ElP Sl!lCRE'i'h'Sih'ElRCElfi+HElFElRN  Page 37 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP K15CilETH8IHORCONJNOPORN \nIn re Directives at 20).  With regard to the individual privacy interests involved, the Court has \nconcluded, as discussed above, that the targeting procedures now before it are reasonably \ndesigned to target non-United States persons who are located outside the United States.  Such \npersons fall outside the ambit of Fourth Amendment protection.  See September 4, 2008 Opinion \nat 37 (citing United States v. Verdugo-Urguidez, 494 U.S. 259, 274-75 (1990)). \nNevertheless, because the government acquires under Section 702 communications to \nwhich United States persons and persons within the United States are parties, that is not the end \nof the matter.  Such acquisitions can occur when those non-targeted persons are parties to a \ncommunication that is to or from, or that contains a reference to, a tasked selector.  See \nSeptember 4, 2008 Opinion at 15-20.  Such communications may also be acquired vvhen they \nconstitute part of a larger \"Internet transaction\" \nthat also contains one or more communications that are \nto or from, or that contain a reference to, a tasked selector. In the latter case, the entire \ntTansaction may be unavoidably acquired by the NSA's \"upstream\" collection.  See October 3, \n2011 Opinion at 5, 30-31.33 \nIn the Prior 702 Dockets, the FISC concluded that earlier versions of the various \nagencies' targeting and minimization procedures adequately protected the substantial Fourth \n33  FISA minimization protects the privacy interests of United States persons in \ncommunications in which they are discussed, regardless of whether they were parties to such \ncommunications.  See Section 1801 (h)(l) (protecting \"nonpublicly available information \nconcerning unconsenting United States persons'') (emphasis added).  In contrast, non-targets \ngenerally do not have a Fourth Amendment-protected interest in communications in which they \nare discussed, unless they are also parties to the communication.  See Alderman v. United States, \n394 U.S. l65, 174-76(1969). \nTOP SECRR'f'HSfi/ORCONiNOF'O:R:N  Page 38 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP SECRETh'SIHORCO~/tfOFORN \nAmendment interests that are implicated by the acquisition of conununications of such United \nStates persons.  See, e.g., August 26,2014 Opinion at 38-40; August 30, 2013 Opinion at 24-25. \nIn the FISC's assessment, the combined effect of these procedures has been \"to substantially \nreduce the risk that non-target information concerning United States persons or persons inside the \nUnited States will be used or disseminated\" and to ensure that \"non-target information that is \nsubject to protection under FISA or the Fourth Amendment is not retained any longer than is \nreasonably necessary.\"  August 26, 2014 Opinion at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n2.  The FBI's Querying Practices Do Not Render the Targeting and \nMinimization Procedures Inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment \nAmicus curiae Amy Jeffress urges the Court to reconsider its prior Fourth Amendment \nassessments and to reach \"a different conclusion\" in light of the provisions of the FBI \nMinimization Procedures, discussed above, permitting agents and analysts to query the Section \n702-acquired information in the FBI's possession using United States-person information for the \npurpose of finding evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence.  See Amicus Brief at 22. \nMs. Jeffress asserts that without additional safeguards, such querying is inconsistent with the \nrequirements of the Foutth Amendment: \nThe FBI's querying procedures effectively treat Section 702-acquired data like \nany other database that can be queried for any legitimate law enforcement purpose.  The \nminimization procedures do not place any restrictions on querying the data using U.S. \nperson identifiers .... As a result, the FBI may query the data using U.S. person \nidentifiers for purposes of any criminal investigation or even an assessment.  There is no \nrequirement that the matter be a serious one, nor that it have any relation to national \nsecurity. . . .  [T]hese practices do not comply with .... the Fourth Amendment. \nld. at 19. According to Ms. Jeffress, the querying provisions of the FBI Minimization Procedures \nshould be revised to \"require a written justification for each U.S. person query of the database \n'fOP SECMYf/fSth'6ft:CONtf{6fOltf~  Page 39 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nthat explains why the query is relevant to foreign inte11igence information or is otherwise \njustified,\" or in some other manner that provides additional protection for the United States \nperson information in the FBI's possession.  See id. at 27. \nAlthough the FBI's minimization procedures have for several years expressly permitted \nthe FBI to query unminimized Section 702-acquired data using query terms that are reasonably \ndesigned to find and extract not only foreign intelligence information but also evidence of a \ncrime, Ms. Jeffress raises concerns that the Court has not expressly addressed in its prior Section \n702 Opinions. The Court agrees with Ms. Jeffress, see kL. at 21-24, that it is not bound by its \nprior approvals of procedures permitting such querying.  Indeed, Section 702 requires the Court \nto assess anew whether the procedures accompanying each certification submitted to it for review \nare both consistent with both the applicable statutory requirements and with the Fourth \nAmendment.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(2)(B)-(C), (i)(3)(A).  After conducting the required \nreassessment, the Court concludes that the FBI's querying practices do not render the \ngovernment's implementation of Section 702 inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. \nMs. Jeffress contends that each query by FBI personnel of Section 702-acquired \ninfom1ation is a \"separate action subject to the Fomih Amendment reasonableness test.\" See \nOctober 20 Transcript at 6; see also Amicus Brief at 24-25.  The government agrees that the \nFBI's querying process is relevant to the Court's reasonableness analysis, but asserts that each \nquery is not a \"separate Fourth Amendment event\" that should be independently assessed.  See \nOctober 20 Transcript at 19.  Rather, in the government's view, it is \"the program as a whole \n[that] must ... be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\" See id. The Court agrees with the \nPage 40 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP SECRET/fSII/ORCONfNOFORN \ngovernment and declines to depart from the analytical framework described above. \nAs discussed above, FISA requires the Court to assess whether \"the targeting and \nminimization procedures adopted in accordance with [50 U.S.C. § 1881a(d) and (e)] are \nconsistent ... with the fourth amendment to the Constitution.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(3)(A).  This \nlanguage directs the Court to assess the constitutionality of the framework created by the \ntargeting and minimization procedures.  Moreover, as also discussed above, the Court of Review \nmade clear in In re Directives that the proper analytical approach to Fourth Amendment \nreasonableness involves \"balanc[ing] the interests at stake\" under the \"totality of the \ncircumstances\" presented.  In re Directives at 20.  That approach requires the Court to weigh the \ndegree to which the government's implementation of the applicable targeting and minimization \nprocedures, viewed as whole, serves its important national security interests against the degree of \nintrusion on Fourth Amendment-protected interests that results from that implementation.  See \nid. at 19-20. \nAfter assessing the FBI's querying practices under the totality of circumstances, the Court \ndeclines to deviate from its prior decisions.  As discussed above, the querying provisions of the \nFBI Minimization Procedures are applied only to information that has been acquired following \napplication of the NSA Targeting Procedures.  Those procedures require that before tasking a \nselector for collection, NSA first take steps to determine that the user of the selector is a non \nUnited States person who is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States and that \nhe or she is expected to possess, receive, or communicate foreign intelligence information.  See \nNSA Targeting Procedures at 4.  These requirements direct the government's acquisitions toward \nPage 41 \n\n..I  \nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP SECRET/fSII/O:RCONrNOFORi\"i \ncommunications that are likely to yield foreign intelligence information. \nMoreover, the purpose of permitting queries designed to elicit evidence of ordinary \ncrimes is not entirely unconnected to foreign intelligence.  Such queries are permitted in part to \nensure that the FBI does not fail to identify the foreign-intelligence significance of information in \nits possession.  One of the main criticisms of the government following the attacks of September \n11, 200 J, was its failure to identify and appropriately distribute information in its possession that \ncould have been used to disrupt the plot.  Although the queries at issue here are designed to fmd \nand extract evidence of crimes believed to be unrelated to foreign intelligence, such queries may \nnonetheless elicit foreign intelligence information, particularly since the Section 702 collection is \ntargeted against persons believed to possess, receive, or communicate such information.  See \nNSA Targeting Procedures at 4.  A query designed to find and extract data regarding \n-plot, for example, might reveal a previously unknown connection to persons believed \nto be funding terrorist operations on behalf  See October 20 Transcript at 20-21. \nSuch unexpected connections may arise only rarely, but when they do arise, the foreign \nintelligence val.ue of the information obtained could be substantial. \nWith respect to the intrusiveness of the querying process, the FBI Minimization \nProcedures impose substantial restrictions on the use and dissemjnation of information derived \nfrom queries.  In the event that a query produces a positive bit on Section 702-acquired \ninformation, the query resuJts can only be viewed by FBI personnel who are appropriately trained \nand approved to handle such information and \"only for the purpose of determining whether it \nreasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign \n'f8P 81!:Cft@'fh'81#8RC8~i/P;'8Jif8ftfy  Page 42 \n\nApproved for public release bY the OON1201604 t 5 \n'F8P SECMl'//SlH8ftC8Pf!f48F\"6RN \ninteHigence information or to assess its jmportance, or to be evidence of a crime:' See FBI \nMinimization Procedm-cs at 8, 12 n.4.  Generally, other VBI personnel who have not been trained \nfor and granted access 1o FISA-acquired information are not allowed to view the query results \nunless the infom1.ation has fust been determined to meet one of these standards.  See FBI \nMinimization Procedures at 12 n.4.  Infonnation lhat is determined to meet one of t.hose criteria \ncan be retained for further investigation and analysis and may be disseminated only in accl)rd~nce \nwith additional restrictions.  See ill:_; see also id. at 30-3 7.

See id. at 9. \nFurthennore, it mw.i be noted that only a subset of the infonnation acquired by the \ngovemment pursuant to Section 702 is subject to queries by the FBI. The FBI acquires only a \n\"small portion\" ofthe uominimized Section 702 collection. Se~ October 20 Transcript at 29-30; \nPCLOB Report at 161 n.571 (Separate Statement By Board Members Rachel Brand and \nElisebeth Collins Cook) (citing Letter from Deirdre M. Walsh, Director of Legislative Affairs, to \nHon. Ron Wyden, United States Senate (June 27. 2014)). The FBI only receives collection on \ntasked facilities that are deemed to he relevant to an open - FBI investigation. See \nOctober 20 Transcript at 30.  Moreover, the l•'BI does not receive any UJUllinimized inibnnation \nacquired through NSA' s \"upstream collection\" under Sectjon 702, a torm of collection that is, on \nPage 43 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f'8P S~CIHJ'f'NSFNOR:C81f/N8F8~( \nbalance, more likely than others to include non-target communications of United States persons \nand persons located in the United States that have no foreign intelligence value.  See \nMemorandum Opinion issued on November 30, 2011, \nat 6. \nFinally, according to the government, FBI queries designed to elicit evidence of crimes \nunrelated to foreign intelligence rarely, if ever, produce responsive results from the Section 702-\nacquired data See PCLOB Report at 59-60; id. at 162 (Separate Statement of Board Members \nBrand and Cook).  Hence, the risk that the results of such a query will be viewed or otherwise \nused in colUlection with an investigation that is unrelated to national security appears to be \nremote, if not entirely theoreticaL  The Court is not prepared to find a constitutional deficiency \nbased upon a hypothetical problem. Nevertheless, to reassure itself that thls risk assessment is \nvalid, the Court will require the government to report any instance in which FBI personnel \nreceive and review Section 702-acquired information that the FBI identifies as concerning a \nUnited States person in response to a query that is not designed to find and extract foreign \nintelligence information.  See page 78 below. \nIn light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the querying provisions of the FBI \nMinimization Procedures strike a reasonable balance between the privacy interests of United \nStates persons and persons in the United States, on the one hand, and the government's natjonaJ \nsecurity interests, on the other.  The FBI's use of those provisions to conduct queries designed to \nreturn evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence does not preclude the Court from \nconcluding that taken together, the targeting and minimization procedures submitted with the \n'F8P SBGM'f'/JSI08RG8Itl+Pi8F8R'f  Page 44 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nTOP \nSli3CRBTHS~/ORCONfNOPORN \n2015 Certifications are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. \nE.  The Compliance and Implementation Issues Reported by the Government Do Not \nPreclude a Finding that the Targeting and Minimization Procedures Comply With \nStatutory Requirements and the Fourth Amendment \nAs noted above at pages 6-7, the FISC examines the government's implementation of, \nand compliance vvith, the targeting and minimization procedures as part of assessing whether \nthose procedures comply with the applicable statutory (and Fourth Amendment) requirements. \nIn conducting this assessment, the Court is mindful that the controlling norms are ones of \nreasonableness, not perfection.34  This distinction is particularly important in the contex't of a \nlarge and complex endeavor such as the government's implementation of Section 702.  While in \nabsolute terms, the scope of acquisitions under Section 702 is substantial, the acquisitions are not \nconducted in a bulk or incliscriminate manner.  Rather, they are effected through \ndiscrete targeting decisions for individual selectors.35  Each targeting decision requires \n34  See Section 188la(d)(l) (requiring targeting procedures tbat are \"reasonably designed\" \nto limit targeting to \"persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States\" and to \n\"prevent the intentional acquisition\" of communications to which all parties are known to be in \nthe United States); Section 1801 (h)(l) (requiring minimization procedures that are \"reasonably \ndesigned\" to minimize acquisition and retention, and to prolribit dissemination, of information \nconcerning United States persons, consistent with foreign intelligence needs); United States v. \nKnights, 534 U.S. 112, 118 (2001) (\"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness \n....\" ). \n35  For example, the NSA reports that, \"on average, approximately-individual \nfacilities\" were tasked for acquisition \"at any given time between Jw1e 1 and August 31, 20 15.\" \nQuarterly Report to the FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section 702 ofFISA, \nsubmitted on September 18,2015, at 1 (footnote omitted) (\"September 18,2015 \"''\"~'+-'· \nFacilities tasked \n\"  Id. at 1 n.l. \"Additionally, between June 1 \n·  and processed approximately-\n(continued ... ) \nTOP SECRti~WSIJ'/ORCONl'NOFORN  Page 45 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\napplication of the pre-tasking provisions of the applicable targeth1g procedures.  See NSA \nTargeting Procedures at 1-6; FBI Targeting Procedures at 1-3.  For each selector while it is \nsubject to tasking, there are post-tasking requirements designed to ascertain, for example, \nwhether its targeted user has entered the United States.  See NSA Targeting Procedures at 6-8. \nAnd pursuant to the minimization procedures, there are detailed rules concerning the retention, \nuse, and dissemination of information obtained pursuant to Section 702.  See NSA Minimization \nProcedures at 3-16; FBI Minimization Procedures at 5-33; CIA Minimization Procedures at 1-9. \nGiven the number of decisions and volume of information involved, it should not be \nsurprising that occasionally errors are made.  Moreover, the government necessarily relies on \n-processes in performing post-tasking checks, see,~. August 30, 2013 Opinion at 7-\n9, and in acquiring, routing, storing, and when appropriate purging Section 702 information. \nSee,~. April 7, 2009 Opinion at 17-22.  Because of factors such as changes in communications \ntechnology or inadvertent error, these processes do not always function as intended. \nIt is apparent to the Court that the implementing agencies, as well as ODNI and the \nNational Security Division (\"NSD\") of DOJ devote substantial resources to their compliance and \noversight responsibilities under Section 702.36  With relatively few exceptions-one of which is \n\"  ld. at 1. \n36  Indeed, during the past year, NSD has provided the Court with a very detailed \noverview of its and ODNI's oversight efforts with respect to the Intelligence Community's \nimplementation of Section 702.  In July 2014, PCLOB recommended that the government \nprovide the Court with random samples oftasking sheets and (NSA's and CIA's) United States \nperson query terms to assist the Court's consideration of Section 702 certifications.  PCLOB \n(continued. .. ) \nPage 46 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\ndiscussed in detail below - instances of non-compliance are identified promptly and appropriate \nremedial actions are taken, to include purging infor.mation that was improperly obtained or \notherwise subject to destruction requirements.  Accordingly, the Court's overall assessment of \nthe implementation of, and compliance with, the targeting and minimization procedures permits a \nfinding that the these procedures, as implemented, satisfy the applicable statutory requirements. \nNonetheless, the Court believes it is useful to discuss the following aspects of implementatlon \nand, in some respects, to direct the government to provide additional information. \n1.  The FBI's Non-compliance With Attomev-Client Minimization \nProcedures \nFISA' s definition of minimization procedures at Section 180 I (h) does not, by its terms, \nafford any special protection to communications subject to the attorney-client priviJege.37 \nNevertheless, as discussed above, the minimization procedures under review have specific rules \nfor handling attorney-client communications.  See NSA Minimization Procedures at 10 ; FBI \nMinimization Procedures at 12-17, 29-30; CIA Minimization Procedures at 5-7.  Because the FBI \n36( .•• continued) \nReport at 141 (Recommendation 4).  The government adopted this recommendation, and in \nJanuary 2015 it provided the Court's legal staff with an extensive briefing on its oversight \nactivities, as well as sample tasking sheets and query terms.  The government offered to make \nadditional taskillg sheets and query terms available to the Court.  At the Court's request, the \ngovernment provided an overview of its Section 702 oversight efforts to all of the Court's judges \nin May 2015, which included a review of sample tasking sheets.  These briefings confirmed the \nCourt's earlier understanding that the government's oversight efforts with respect to Section 702 \ncollection are robust. \n37  FISA does provide that \"[n]o otherwise privileged communication obtained in \naccordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of [FISA] shall lose its privileged character.\" \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(a). \nTOP SECR6THSIHOR€0N>\"lOPO~  Page 47 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f'OP St?:CRF:'f'I/SI/YORCON-INOfORN \nhas law enforcement responsibilities and often works closely with prosecutors in criminal cases, \nits procedures have detailed requirements for cases in which a target is known to be charged with \na federal crime.  Unless otherwise authorized by the NSD, the FBI must establish a separate \nreview team whose members \"have no role in the prosecution of the charged criminal matter\" to \nconduct the initial review of such a target's communications. FBI Minimization Procedures at \n13.  When that review team identifies a privileged communication concerning the charged \ncriminal matter, \"the original record or portion thereof containing that privileged \ncommunication\" is sequestered with the FISC and other copies are destroyed (save only any \nelectronic version retained as an archival backup, access to which is restricted). Id.  As discussed \nabove, the FBI Minimization Procedures contain new provisions designed to further enhance the \nprotection of attorney-client privileged communications. ~FBI Minimization Procedures at \n17-18. \nAt the time the Court was considering the 2014 Certifications, the government had \nII \nidentified  instances, discovered in the preceding six months, in which FBI case agents knew \nthat persons targeted under Section 702 faced federal criminal charges, but had not established \nthe required review teams.  See August 26,2014 Opinion at 35-36. The government generally \nattributed those instances to inclividual failures or confusion, rather than a \"systematic issue.\" Id. \nThe Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order issued in connection with the 2014 Certifications \nnoted that one would expect the number of Section 702 targets charged with federal crimes to be \nfairly small, given that these targets are reasonably believed to be non-United States persons \nlocated outside of the United States  Id. at 36.  Accordingly, the Court noted thatllthen-recent \n'fOP SIBCIH!:'fh'S'h'l'ORCO~IftoiOPQRJl  Page 48 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'FOP SECRE'FHSIHORCOJ'i+NOF'Om\"i \ncases in which the FBI had not established the required review teams seemed to represent a \npotentially significant rate of non-compliance.  Id.  In light of this, the Court required, among \nother things, that the government make a subsequent written submission providing an assessment \nofthe adequacy of the government's training, guidance and oversight efforts with regard to the \nrequirements for attorney-client privileged communications in the FBI Minimization Procedures. \nId. at 42-43. \nSince the Court approved the prior certifications in August 2014, the government has \nidentified an additional ~~instances in which FBI case agents knew that persons targeted under \nSection 702 faced federal criminal charges, but did not establish the required review teams.38  In \nnotifying the Court  instances, the government wrote that\"[w   ]hile there \nhave been isolated instances in which FBI personnel have not established review teams, the \nGovernment continues to believe that these were the result of individual failures or confusion and \n38 See Quarterly Report to the FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section 702 \nofFISA, submitted on December 19, 2014 (\"December 19,2014 Compliance Report\"), at 83-86; \nQuarterly Report to the FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section 702 ofFISA, \nsubmitted on March 20,2015 (\"March 20,2015 Compliance Report\"), at 71-73; Quarterly \nReport to the FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section 702 of FISA, submitted on \nJune 19, 2015 (\"June 19, 2015 Compliance Report\"), at 110-113; September 18, 2015 \n'-'\"'-\"\"::\"::'·~  Notice of Compliance Incident \n'F8P S'BeftEIFNSII/8R€8N1 'N81i'ORJ'l  Page49 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nnot a systematic issue. \"39  Review of the individual instances indeed suggests that at least some \nFBI case agents are generally aware of the requirement for a review team when a Section 702 \ntarget is charged with a federal crime, but they are confused about the specific requirements of \nthe FBI Minimization Procedures. \nset up ad hoc or infmmal review teams wherein a case agent or a professional support employee \nnot involved with the investigation was assigned to review commw1ications for attorney-client \nprivileged material prior to the case agent and team members reviewing the communications.40 \nother instances, the relevant FBI case agents were generally aware of the requirement \nfor a review team, but mistakenly believed that a review team is not required if the pertinent \ncharging document is under seal or if the target is located outside of the United States.41 \nThe Court was extremely concerned about these additional instances of non·compliance, \nand at the October 8 Hearing on compliance matters, the Court asked the government to explain \nwhy there bad been an additional. nstances of non-compliance in the past year.42  The \ngovernment indicated that it had taken a tvvo-pronged approach to improving compliance with \nthese provisions of the minimization procedures during the preceding year.

The Court understands from \npost-hearing communications with the government that for de-tasked facilities, identifying \nremaining instances of non-compliance with the review team requirement will likely happen \nthrough NSD oversight reviews. \nThe Court does not believe that the recent instances of non-compliance with the review \nteam requirement prevent a finding that the minimization procedures under review comply with \nthe requirements of Section 180l(h) and the Fourth Amendment.  However, the Court strongly \nencourages the government to try to identifY any remaining instances of non-compliance as \nquickly as possible.

In recognizing this \nexception, the Court noted that: \nCongress may be presumed not to have prohibited actions that are necessary to mitigate \nor prevent the harms at which Section 1809(a)(2) is addressed.  But the application of this \nprinciple must be carefully circumscribed, so that it does not lead to an unjustified \ndeparture from the tem1s of the statute. \"[W]hen Congress has spoken c1early, a court \nassessing the reach of the crinlinal statute must heed Congress's intent as  ·  the \ntext.\"  Docket No. PRiTT- Memorandum Opinion issued on \nat 113 (citing Huddleston v.

After review \nof this submission aud a hearing, the Court issued an opinion in May 2011 in which it found that \nthe unauthorized collection in this case did not fall within the implicit narrow exception to § \n1809(a)(2), and that the NSA's Electronic Surveillance SMPs required the destruction of the \nunauthorized collection in this case.

See \npage 79 below. \n4. \na.  Introduction \nAs noted above, on July 13,2015, the government filed a letter regarding the NSA's \npurge processes for FISA~acquired information in NSA \"mission management systems.» In \naddition to discussing  this letter also \"serve[d ] as notice pursuant to Rule \n13(b) [of the FISC's Rules of Procedure] of a compliance incident regarding PIS A-acquired \ninformation subject to purge or age off that is being retained in two ofNSA's compliance \nmission management systems,  and- \"  July 13, 2015 Notice at 2. \nMore specifically, the letter noted that the government had \"concluded that these two systems \nhave been retaining data subject to purge and age-otT in a marmer that is potentially inconsistent \nwith NSA's FISA-related minimization procedures.\" July 13,2015 Notice at 5.  Subsequent \ncommunications between the govenunent and Court staff revealed that  and \nalso have been retaining data, the use or disclosure of which could violate 50 \nU.S.C. § 1809(a)(2). \nb.  Relevant Legal Authorities \nAnalysis of the issues presented by  disclosures \nrequires consideration of the following legal authorities: \n'f'O:f St;CRE'iWSINO:RCONINOFORN  Page 60 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'fOP SJ!:CREl¥/Sth'6:lt€6NfNOI\"6ftN \ni.  50 USC.§ 188la \nAs discussed above, Section 702, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 188la, permits the Attorney \nGeneral and the Director ofNational Intelligence to target non-United States persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside of the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information. 50 \nU.S.C. § 188la(a).  Acquisitions under Section 702 must comply with a number of! imitations, \nthe first of which is that the government may not intentionally target any person knov.'D at the \ntime of acquisition to be located in the United States  50 U.S.C. §188la(b)(l). To effect this \nprohibition, the statute requires the adoption and use of targeting procedures that are reasonably \ndesigned to ensure that Section 702 acquisitions are limited to targeting persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside of the United States.  50 U.S.C. § 188la(c)(l)(A), (d)(l)(A). \nSection 702 also prohibits the government from intentionally targeting a United States person \nreasonably believed to be outside of the United States, or acquiring any communication as to \nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in \nthe United States.  50 U.S.C. §188la(b)(3),(4). \nii.  NSA Targeting Procedures \nThe NSA Targeting Procedures contain a number of provisions designed to enable its \ncompliance with the requirements and prohibitions of Section 702.  Among the most important \nare Sections I and II.  Section I of the procedures, which relates to the determination of whether a \ngiven target is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United \nStates, provides that the NSA \nTOP SE6RETNSFHOR€9NlNOFORi'~  Page 61 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nthe procedures provide \nSection II of the NSA Targeting Procedures also provides \nthat \"[a]fter a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will conduct post-targeting \nanalysis.\"  Id. at 6.  For electronic communications  this analysis \nmay include \"[r]outinely checking all electronic communications \ntasked pursuant to these nrc,ce(mn~s \nto determine if an electronic communications \naccessed from inside the U.S.\"  ld. \niii.  NSA Minimization Procedures \nSection 2(e) of the NSA Minimization Procedures defines a foreign communication as \none that bas at least one communicant outside of the United States, and all other communications \nare considered domestic communications. NSA Minimization Procedures at 2.  Section 3(d )(2) \nof the NSA Minimization Procedures also provides that \"[a] ny communications acquired through \nthe targeting of a person who at the time of targeting was reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States but is in fact located inside the United States at the time such \ncommunications were acquired . .. will be treated as domestic communications ... [.]\" NSA \nPage 62 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nMinimization Procedures at 9.  Section 5 of the NSA Minimization Procedures provides that a \ndomestic communication will be promptly destroyed upon recognition, unless the Director of \nNSA specifically determines that the sender or intended recipient had been properly targeted, and \nthe communication satisfies one or more additional requirements (e.g., the communication is \nreasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information).  NSA Minimization \nProcedures at 12.  Notwithstanding this destruction requirement, Section 5 also provides that \n\"NSA may ... use information derived from domestic communications for collection avoidance \npurposes, and ... NSA may retain the communication from which such information is derived \nbut shall restrict the further use or dissemination of the communication by placing it on the \nMaster Purge List (MPL).\"  Id. at 13. \nWith respect to the length of time that NSA is permitted to retain Section 702 collection, \nSection 3(c) ofthe procedures provides, in relevant part, that I) telephony communications and \nInternet communications acquired by or with the assistance of the FBI from Internet Service \nProviders may not be retained longer than five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection, unless the NSA specifically determines that each such communication \nmeets retention standards in the procedures; 2) Internet transactions acquired through NSA's \nupstream collection techniques may not be retained longer than two years from the expiration \ndate of the certification authorizing the collection (unless NSA makes particular findings about \nthe transaction); and 3) any Internet transactions acquired through NSA's upstream collection \ntechniques prior to to October 31, 2011, will be destroyed upon recognition.

Government's Proposed Resolution ofI dentified Issues \nThe Government's October 21, 2015 Response provided more detailed infom1ation about \nand  some of which is noted above.  It also indicated that the NSA \nwiJl begin complying with some elements of its minimization procedures which it is currently \nviolating.  Finally, the submission included the government's justifications under the NSA \nMinimization Procedures and 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(2) for the retention and use in \nand  f other information otherwise subject to purge. \nWith respect to the NSA's non-compliance with the age-off requirements in its \nminimization procedures, the Goverrunent's October 21, 2015 Response indicated that the NSA \nwill begin implementing the age-off time periods required by the procedures. Government's \nOctober 21,2015 Response at 13-14.  With respect to the NSA's retention i  and \nof data associated with objects on the MPL, the government noted that despite the \ngeneral destruction requirement for domestic commurrications, Section 5 of the NSA \nMinimization Procedw·es pennits the NSA to use information derived from such \ncommunications for collection avoidance purposes. 52  ld. at 19.  The government noted that the \nNSA has been retaining information i~and  that has been placed on \nthe MPL for the very purpose of collection avoidance.  ld. The Government's October 21, 2015 \n52 Again, as noted above, Section 5 of the i  SA Minimization Procedures states that \n\"[n]otwithstanding the [general destruction requirement] above, .. . NSA may ... use \ninfo1mation derived from domestic communications for collection avoidance purposes, and may \nprovide such information to the FBI and CIA for col1ection avoidance purposes.  NSA may retain \nthe communication from which such information is derived but shall restrict the further use or \ndissemination of the communication by placing it on rhe Master Purge List[.]\" NSA \nMinimization Procedures at 13. \nPage 69 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'f'6P SE€Ri!Yf//Slh'6RCON/f.6F'6Rf'i \nResponse also argued that keeping information in these systems that has been placed on the MPL \nsupports the NSA's obligations under Sections I and II of the NSA Targeting Procedures.  ld. at \n5, n.3, and 8, n.9.  As described above, those provisions require the NSA to conduct pre- and \npost-tasking checks on Section 702 selectors by checldng its data repositories to determine a \ntarget's location. ld. The government noted that \"foreignness determinations, both pre-tasking \nand post-tasking, are a fundamental element of Section 702's statutory scheme, and \"contribute \nsignificantly to the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of Section 702 collection.\" ld. at 17. \nNotwithstanding the government's argument that retention of information on the MPL in \nand  is consistent with the NSA's procedures, the government \nindicated that it plans to modizy its treatment of information collected under FISA and placed on \nthe MPL to better ensure that such information is only used for collection avoidance.  Id. at 14. \nSpecifically, the government indicates that for  if the underlying data is subject to \npurge, NSA will delete the underlying data from~d analysts will only be able to \naccess FISA-acquired or derived information in the following specific fields: \nAs part of the query response, analysts will also receive notjce that the \nevidence supporting the foreignness determination has been purged from  ld. at \nAttachment A. \nWith respect to  the government indicated that going forward, if the \nunderlying data is subject to purge, NSA will limit access to FISA-acquired or derived \n'f6P SECRE'fi/St/16RC6{1{/N6FORN  Page 70 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'FOP SECREii'//Sil'fOR€0N/NOFORN \ninformation in  the following specific fields: \ngovernment's submission noted that access to this \ninformation will be restricted to compliance and technical personnel, and intelligence analysts \nwill only see a notice indicating that the information has been purged.  Id.  Again, the \ngovernment noted that altering the way in which it treats information collected under FISA and \nplaced on the MPL will further ensure that this information is only used for collection avoidance. \nId. \nThe Court is persuaded by the government's argument that Section 5 of the NSA \n:Minimization Procedures does not prohibit the NSA from keeping data in  and \nthat is derived from domestic communications placed on the MPL for the purpose \nof collection avoidance.  The Court also appreciates the NSA's plan to modify its treatment of \nSection 702-acquired information in  that has been placed on the \nMPL, to further ensure that it is only used for collection avoidance.  Accordingly, the information \nthat remains of concern to the Court- at least insofar as the NSA's compliance with its targeting \nand minimization procedures is concerned - is what the Court assesses to be the much smaller \ncategories of Section 702-acquired information in  ~t have been \nplaced on the MPL because of other destruction requirements under the NSA Targeting and \nMinimization Procedures. Examples would be incidentally acquired communications of or \nconcerning United States persons that are clearly not relevant to the authorized purpose of the \n'F8P S~CRS'f'//Sil¥8RC8Pi+N8F8tui  Page 71 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\nt'8P Si3Clti3't'//St1/8:R:C8Pifli8F8ft1Ri \nacquisition or that do not contain evidence of a crime which may be disseminated under the \nminimization procedures (see Section 3(b)(l) ofNSA Minimization Procedures); attorney-client \ncommunications that do not contain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime (see \nSection 4(a) ofNSA Minimization Procedures); and any instances in which the NSA discovers \nthat a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United States at \nthe time of targeting has been intentionally targeted under Section 702 (see Section IV of the \nNSA Targeting Procedures).  The Court is directing the government to report on 1) how the NSA \nplans to comply with its targeting and minimization procedures with respect to these other \ncategories of information in  or alternatively, 2) how the retention \nand use of these other categories of infonnation ·  COillOI)rtS with \nthe NSA's targeting and minimization procedures.  See page 78 below. The Court also expects \nto hear from the government on this issue at the aforementioned follow-up hearing on Section \n702 compliance matters in early 2016. \nThe other issue the Court directed the govemment to report on in its October 14, 2015 \nOrder was how the govemment justified under 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(2) the retention and use in \nof information otherwise subject to purge.  As noted above, § \n1809(a)(2) states that \"a person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally ... discloses or uses \ninfonnation obtained under color oflaw by electronic surveillance, knowing or having reason to \nknow that the information was obtained through eJectronic surveillance not authorized\" by \nstatute.  50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(2).  Accordingly, a violation of§ 1809(a)(2) must involve the \nintentional disclosure or use of infonnation that is obtained through activity that meets the \nPage 72 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'F8P St1E~'I'h'Sif/8R:C8Pfl~'l8F8ftN \ndefinition of \"electronic surveillance;\"53 that activity must have been unauthorized; and the use or \ndisclosure must be made with at least reason to know it was unauthorized.5 4 \nThe plain language of§ 1809(a)(2) does not require the NSA to search for and identify \ninformation in  and  may be subject to the criminal prohibition.  It \nsimilarly does not require the NSA to destroy information in these systems that is subject to § \n1809(a)(2). It does, however, prohibit the NSA from intentionally disclosing or using \ninformation under the circumstances described above.  Therefore, when the NSA knows or has \nreason to know that a piece of information was acquired through an unauthorized electronic \nsurveillance, it has an affirmative statutory obligation to refrain from disclosing or using it. \nNotably, this Court has previously stated that the collection of \"roamer communications\" \ndoes not generally violate Section 702.  Specifically, in the September 4, 2008 Opinion \nreferenced above, the Court stated the following: \n53 It is worth noting that 50 U.S.C. § 1827 contains analogous criminal prohibitions \nrelated to physical search, which could include the acquisition of stored data under Section 702. \ns4 With respect to this knowledge element, the Court has previously stated the following: \nWhen it is not known, and there is no reason to know, that a piece of information was \nacquired through electronic surveillance that was not authorized by the Court's prior \norders, the information is not subject to the criminal prohibition in Section 1809(a)(2). \nOf course, government officials may not avoid the strictures of Section 1809(a)(2) by \ncultivating a state of deliberate ignorance when reasonable inquiry would establish that \ninformation was indeed obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance.  See~ \nUnited States v. Whitehall, 532 F.3d 746,751 (8'h Cir.) (where \"failure to investigate is \nequivalent to 'burying one's head in the sand,'\" willful blindness may constitute \nknowledge), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 610 (2008). \nT8P S~ER>B'F:'JSil\\'8RE8Pl/ff8F8:RJi  Page 73 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'fOP SECRE'f//SI//OftCONfNOPORN \nThere may be cases where, after properly applying the targeting procedures, the \ngovernment reasonably believes at the time it acquires a communication that a target is a \nnon-U.S. person outside the United States, when in fact the target is a U.S. person and/or \nis in the United States.  The acquisition of such communications is properly authorized \nunder Section 188la notwithstanding the fact that the government is prohibited from \nintentionally targeting U.S. persons or persons inside the United States, or intentionally \nacquiring a communication when it is known that all parties thereto are inside the United \nStates. \nSeptember 4, 2008 Opinion at 26 (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, the domestic \ncommunications that the NSA acquires when non-United States person targets who are \nreasonably believed to be outside of the United States are in fact in the United States are not \nsubject to§ 1809(a)(2), as their acquisition was authorized under Section 702.55 \nAs noted above, the Court recognized a narrow, implicit exception to § 1809(a)(2) in the \nDecember 201  December 2010  8.  Specifically, the Court \nrecognized an exception for use or disclosure of the \"results of unauthorized surveillance [that] \nare needed to remedy past unauthorized surveillance or prevent similar unauthorized surveillance \nin the future.\"  Id.  The Court made clear that this exception applied to \"actions that are necessary \nto mitigate or prevent the very harms at which Section 1809(a)(2) is addressed.\"  Id.

In this case, the ongoing \ncollection of\"roamer communications'' would exceed the authorization to acquire \ncommunications under Section 702.

As \ndescribed in the May 2011  the determination of whether the use or ctisclosure of \nunauthorized electronic surveillance falls within the exception to § 1809(a)(2) is a fact-driven \nassessment and involves an analysis of whether the use or disclosure of that specific information \njs .. necessary to avoid similar instances of over-collection (e.g., by identifying and remedying a \ntechnical malfunction) or to remedy a prior over-collection (e.g., by aiding the identification of \nover-collected information in various storage systems).\"  May 2011  4-5.  The \nGovernment's October 21, 2015 Response argued that a more programmatic or categorical \napproach to the exception is warranted in the context of Section 702 collection.  Government's \nOctober 21, 2015 Response at 23-24,27.  That may be correct, but on the current record, the \ngovernment has not made a persuasive case that all of the information that it wants to retain in \nTOP SECRE'F//Sf/JOR:CONINOPORN  Page 75 \n\nApproved for public release by the ODNI 20160415\n'F8P SI3€Ri!:'t'I/SII/8RC8N1N8f.'8ftf( \nwithin this exception. In these circumstances, the Court \nsimply cannot conclude whether or not the government's proposed cow·se of action is wholly \nconsistent with§ 1809(a)(2). Nor does the Court have the authority to permit violations of§ \n1809(a)(2), even when they are de minimis.56 \nIn summary, it is likely that most Section 702 information \nis otherwise subject to purge pertains to roamer communications, and \ntherefore may be retained under the NSA Minimization Procedures for collection avoidance \npurposes and generally does not implicate§ 1809(a)(2).  Other Section 702 information that the \ngovernment proposes to retain i~d  notwithstanding generally \n56 As the Court explained in th~pinion, \nTo be sure, this Court, like all other Article III courts, was vested upon its creation ·with \ncertain inherent powers.  See fu reMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F.  Supp. 2d \n484,486 (FISA Ct. 2007); see also Chambers v. NASCO. Inc., 501 U.S. 32,43 (1991) \n(\"It has long been understood that [c  ]ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our \nCourts ofj ustice from the nature of the their institution. ... \"). It is well settled, \nhowever, that the exercise of such authority \"is invalid if it conflicts with constitutional or \nstatutory provisions.\" Thomas v. Am. 474 U.S. 140, 148 (1985).  And definlng crimes is \nnot among the inherent powers of the federal courts; rather, federal crimes are defined by \nCongress and are solely creatures of statute.  Sousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 620-\n21 (1998); United States v. Hudson, ll U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812).  Accordingly, \nwhen Congress has spoken clearly, a court assessing the reach of a criminal statute must \nheed Congress's intent as reflected in the statutory text.  See,~. Huddleston v. United \nStates, 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974). The plain language of Section 1809(a)(2) makes it a \ncrime for any person, acting under color of law, intentionally to use or disclose \ninformation with knowledge or reason to know that the information was obtained through \nunauthorized electronic surveillance.  The Court simply lacks the power, inherent or \notherwise, to authorize the government to engage in conduct that Congress has \nunambiguously prohibited. \n·on at 113 (footnote omitted). \n'fOf SECH'f7'1Sth'6ltC6N'!N6f.'6ft:N  Page 76 \n\nTOP S~CIQlT/JSIHOR:CON/NOFOI~ \napplicable purge requirements, is limited in nature and also would be used for collection \navoidance and other compliance-related purposes.  For these reasons, the Court does not believe \nthat the aforementioned issues related to  and  a finding that \nthe NSA Targeting Procedures and Minimization Procedures, taken as a whole, comply with the \napplicable statutory and Fourth Amendment requirements. The Court does expect, however, to \nhear more from the government about how it is applying the destruction requirements of those \nprocedures to Section 702 information in  the compliance \nhearing to be held in e.arly 2016.  Finally, the Court cannot find, at least on the current record, \nthat the information the government proposes to retain ·  and  falls \nentirely within the implicit exception to § 1809(a)(2)'s prohibition on disclosure and use. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that:  (1) the 2015 Certifications, a<; well as the \ncertifications in the Prior 702 Dockets as amended by the 2015 Certifications, contain all the \nrequired statutory elements; (2) the targeting and minimization procedures to be implemented \nregarding acquisitions conducted pursuant to the 2015 Certifications comply with 50 U.S.C. \n§ 188la(d)-(e) and are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment; and (3) the \nminimization procedures to be implemented regarding information acquired under prior Section \n702 certifications comply with 50 U.S.C. §1881a(d)-(e) and are consistent with the requirements \nof the Fout1h Amendment.  Orders approving the certifications, amended certifications, and use \nof the accompanying procedures are being entered contemporaneously here·with. \nFor the reasons discussed above, it is HEREBY ORDERED as follows: \n'f'OP SECRI!\\\"fHSif10ftC6Nffl6F61tN  Page 77 \n\n1.  The government shall submit a report to the Court by December 18, 2015, describing \na) bow the NSA plans to comply \"-'ith its targeting and minimization procedures with respect to \nthe categories of information in  that are identified on pages 71-72 \nofthis opinion, or alternatively, b) how the retention and use of the aforementioned categories of \ninformation in  comports with the NSA's targeting and \nminimization procedures. \n2.  The government shall promptly submit in writing a report describing each instance in \nwhich NSA or CIA invokes the provision of its minimization procedures stating that «[n]oth.ing \nin these procedures shall prohibit the retention, processing, or dissemination of information \nreasonably necessary to comply with specific constitutional, judicial, or legislative mandates.\" \nSee NSA Minimization Procedures at 1; CIA Minimization Procedures at 4-5.  Each such report \nshould describe the circumstances of the deviation from the procedures and identify the specific \nmandate on which the deviation was based. \n3.  The government shall promptly submit in \\Vnting a report concerning each instance \nafter December 4, 2015, in which FBI personnel receive and review Section 702-acquired \ninformation that the FBI identifies as concerning a United States person in response to a query \nthat is not designed to find and extract foreign intelligence information.  The report should \ninclude a detailed descripti.on of the information at issue and the manner in which it has been or \nwill be used for analytical, investigative, or evidentiary purposes.  It shall also identifY the query \nterms used to elicit the information and provide the FBI's basis for concluding that the query is \nconsistent with the applicable minimization procedures. \nPage 78 \n\nT8P S~CRE'f:'/Sis'/9RCEHWPJ91'8Ftff \n4.
