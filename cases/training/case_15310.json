    "summary": "<p>On July 29, 2015, the ACLUs of Northern and Southern California, along with family members of criminal defendants who were declared incompetent to stand trial, filed this lawsuit in California state court.  The plaintiffs sued the State of California under Article I, §§ 7 and 15 of the California Constitution, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and Cal. Code Civ. Pro. §526a.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and ACLU attorneys sought declaratory and injunctive relief, a writ of mandate, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  The plaintiffs claimed that the State of California has failed to adequately and timely transfer criminal defendants, who have been found incompetent to stand trial, to appropriate treatment facilities.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that some individuals with mental disorders had been waiting for transfer for up to 258 days.  The average time between the dates of commitment and admission for the most recent 25 persons admitted California treatment facilities as of February 9, 2015 had been more than 75 days.  Plaintiffs alleged that the wait was even longer for those defendants with developmental disabilities.  They claimed that as of April 2, 2015, 11 individuals had been waiting for more than nine months following their commitment, two for over a year.  Two of the plaintiffs alleged that due to the lack of proper treatment in Sutter County Jail, their father committed suicide, while another claimed that her son was subjected to sexual abuse multiple times by another inmate while awaiting transfer.</p><p>On October 1, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss and filed a demurrer to the plaintiffs’ complaint. Judge Winifred Y. Smith, on April 26, 2016, overruled the demurrer on all four of the plaintiffs’ actions as well as their mandamus claim, but also dismissed the State of California as a defendant.  Judge Smith agreed with the defendants that some of the taxpayer allegations should be dismissed, but only in regards to one plaintiff who had no taxpayer allegations in the complaint. </p><p>On October 16, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for a stay of the discovery hearing, but Judge Evelio Grillo denied this motion on November 18, 2015.</p><p>As of June 7, 2016, this case is open and ongoing.</p>",

Pts. & Authorities (RGI5779731) \n\nI  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  INTRODUCTION \n3  Plaintiffs, five relatives of criminal defendants declared incompetent to stand trial (IST \n4  defendants) and two American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) organizations, bring this action for \n5  court oversight over the timeframe for the admission of all IST defendants with mental disorders \n6  committed in all state courts to the Department of State Hospitals (DSH) and, for those IST \n7  defendants with developmental disabilities, to the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) \n8  for competency training and evaluation.  By this demmTer, defendants Pamela Ahlin, sued in her \n9  official capacity as Director ofDSH, Santi Rogers, sued in his official capacity as Director of the \nI 0  DDS, and the State of California contend the complaint and each of its causes of action cannot \n11  proceed as a matter of law. \n12  The complaint is defective on a number of grounds.  Both the individual and the \n13  organizational plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action.  The individual plaintiffs, five relatives \n14  ofiST defendants, cannot establish standing as real parties in interest or as taxpayers.  Because of \n15  their tax-exempt status, plaintiffs ACLU- Northern and ACLU-Southern cannot show taxpayer \n16  standing under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a.  Even if standing exists, plaintiffs' state and \n17  federal constitutional claims are barred by the two-year limitations period.  There is no private \n18  cause of action, particularly for relatives and associations, concerning the state constitutional right \n19  to a speedy trial.  Moreover, plaintiffs Stiavetti and Bock cannot assert any unconstitutional delay \n20  in admission occurred.  Even ifthere was an unconstitutional delay, the habeas process provides \n21  an adequate remedy and so forecloses plaintiffs' due process claims.  The complaint does not \n22  state a Section 1983 claim against the State of California and these state officials.  Indeed, the \n23  State of California is not subject to suit under any of the causes of action. \n24  More generally, the sought injunctive and mandamus relief intrudes upon defendants Ahlin \n25  and Rogers' statutory discretion to determine the timeframe and placement ofiST defendants. \n26  Plaintiffs mistalcenly assume IST defendants may only be placed in DSH and DDS for \n27  competency training and evaluation when other statutory options exist.  Because plaintiffs seek a \n28 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  specific timeframe for admission where none is provided in the statutory schemes, the complaint . \n2  should be dismissed without leave to amend. \n3  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n4  A.  State Law Claims \n5  Where a complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as against a \n6  defendant, a demurrer is proper.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)  A demurrer for \n7  uncertainty is \"not intended to reach the failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading, but \n8  is directed at the uncertainty existing in the allegations actually made.\"  (Bacon v.  Wahrhaftig \n9  (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.)  A pleading must \"allege facts and not conclusions,\" and any \nI 0  \"allegations of material facts which are left to surmise are subject to special demurrer for \n11  uncertainty.\"  (Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531, 537.) \n12  B.  Federal Law Claims \n13  State courts apply \"federal law to determine whether a complaint has pleaded a cause of \n14  action tmder section 1983 sufficient to survive a general demurrer.\"  (Greene v. Zank (1984) !58 \n15  Cal.App.3d 497, 503; accord Bach v. County ofB  utte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 563.)  A \n16  Section 1983 claim must demonstrate facial plausibility.  (Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009) 556 U.S. 662, \n17  678-679.)  A pleading that offers \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the \n18  elements of a cause of action will not do.\"  (Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly (2007) 550 U.S. 544, \n19  555.)  When a plaintiff has not \"nudged [his] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, \n20  [his] complaint must be dismissed.\"  (Twombly, supra, 550 U.S. at p. 570.) \n21  C.  Judicial Estoppel \n22  The \"essential function and justification of judicial estoppel is to prevent the use of \n23  intentional self-contradiction as a means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for \n24  suitors seeking justice.\"  (Billmeyer v.  Plaza Bank of Commerce (1995) 42 Cal.App.4th 1086, \n25  1092; Drain v. Betz Laboratories, Inc. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 950,. 955.) \"The gravamen of this \n26  doctrine ... precludes a party from gaining an advantage by taldng one position, and then seeking a \n27  second advantage by taking an incompatible position.\"  (Prilliman v.  United Air Lines, Inc. \n28  (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 957.) \n2 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\nI  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n2  I.  THE DISTINCT STATUTORY SCHEMES FOR 1ST DEFENDANTS WITH MENTAL \nDISORDERS AND THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. \n3 \n4  A criminal defendant may be found incompetent to stand trial due to (I) a mental disorder \n5  or (2) a developmental disability.  (Pen. Code,§ 1367, subd. (a).)  \"Different procedures apply in \n6  each instance.\"  (In re Williams (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 989, 1001.)  Penal Code section 1370 \n7  applies to a person found incompetent due solely to mental disorder.  (Ibid.)  In contrast, Penal \n8  Code section 1370.1 applies to a criminal defendant found incompetent due to developmental \n9  disability and to a criminal defendant who is incompetent as a result of a mental disorder, but is \n10  also developmentally disabled.  (Ibid.; see also Pen. Code,§ 1367, subd. (b).) \n11  Under both Penal Code section 1370 and section 1370.1, an IST defendant must be \n12  provided competency training that \"will promote the defendant's speedy\" attainment of mental \n13  competence.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370, subd. (a)(l)(B)(i); Pen. Code, §1370.1, subd. (a)(l)(B)(i).)  An \n14  IST defendant \"cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine \n15  whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable \n16  future.\"  (Jackson v. Indiana (1972) 406 U.S. 715, 738; see also In re Davis (1973) 8 Cal.3d 798, \n17  801 [IST defendant with mental disorder].)  In accord, both Penal Code section 1370 m1d 1370.1 \n18  indicate a three-year limitation on the confinement period.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370, subd. (c)(!); Pen. \n19  Code,§ 1370.1, subd. (c)(l)(A).)  However, as more fully discussed below, neither statutory \n20  scheme indicates a qum1titative time frame for admission to DSI-I or DDS.  Rather, the statutory \n21  schemes vest DSI-I and DDS with discretion to manage the admission and placement of IST \n22  defendants in light of population caps on certain facilities and security issues posed by the IST \n23  defendants.  Moreover, DSH and DDS are not the exclusive providers of competency training; \n24  other facilities and entities may provide such training. \n25  A.  The Statutory Scheme for 1ST Defendants with Mental Disorders. \n26  1.  DSH is not the only placement option for PC 1370 1ST defendants. \n27  In 2010, the Second District Court of Appeal expressed that DSH's therapeutic milieu \n28  warranted placement of all IST defendants in DSH.  (In re Mille (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 635, \n3 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  648-650.)  At the time of the Mille decision, the statutory.definition of a treatment facility for IST \n2  defendants did not include a county jail, particularly because Penal Code section 1369.1 severely \n3  restricted county jails to in their administration of the anti-psychotic medications often needed by \n4  IST defendants.  (!d. at p. 647.)  However, after the Mille decision, the Legislature amended Penal \n5  Code section 1370 to provide that a treatment facility for IST defendants included a county jail, \n6  with the corollary amendment to Penal Code section 1369.1 stating that \"a treatment facility \n7  includes a county jail.\"  (Pen. Code, § 1370, subds. (a)(! )(B)(i) & (a)(2)(A);  Pen. Code, \n8  § 1369.1, subd. (a); Stats. 2012, c. 24, § 25, eff. June 27, 2012.)  In 2014, A.B. 1468 further \n9  amended Penal Code section 13 70 to add community-based residential treatment facilities as a \n10  placement option for IST defendants.  (Pen. Code,§§ 1370, subds. (a)(l)(B)(i) & (a)(2)(A).) \n11  As a result, DSH is not the sole provider of competency care to IST defendants.  An IST \n12  defendant may now be committed by the superior court, subject to the recommendation of the \n13  community program director, to a variety of settings: (I) a DSH facility, or (2) any other public or \n14  private treatment facility, including a local county jail treatment facility or a community-based \n15  residential treatment system provided under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5670 et seq. \n16  (so long as the facility has a secured perimeter), or a locked and controlled treatment facility, or \n17  (3) placed on outpatient status.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370, subd. (a)(1)(B)(i).)  These additional \n18  placement options meet the statutory mandate that an IST defendant \"shall be treated as near to \n19  the patient's community as possible if an appropriate treatment' program is available.\"  (Welf. & \n20  In st. Code, § 722 8.) \n21  Moreover, since 2008, the Legislature has funded the Restoration of Competency Program \n22  (ROC), in which DSH pays a contractor to provide in-custody competency training to IST \n23  defendants housed at county jails.  (Exh. 1, Leg. Analyst Office Rpt.; Req. J. Not.)  In light of the \n24  success of the ROC program in San Bernardino County, the Legislature has provided additional \n25  funding to activate the ROC (jail-based competency) program in Sacramento County and \n26  elsewhere.  (Exh. 2, Gov. Budget Summary, FY 2015-16; Exh. 3, Sacramento County \n27  Authorization; Req. J. Not.) \n28  II \n4 \n'  Defendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\nI  2.  DSH's statutory discretion over the admission of IST defendants. \n2  In June 2014, the Legislature enacted the A.B. 1468 amendments to Penal Code section \n3  13 70 which, inter alia, shifted control over the admission ofiST defendants from the committing \n4  court to DSH and increased DSH's statutory discretion.  The committing court must provide a \n5  packet, containing medical as well as psychiatric, legal, and security information, on each IST \n6  defendant to DSH \"prior to admission\" of theIST defendant.  (Pen. Code, § 1370, subd. (a)(3).) \n7  With that informational packet, DSH must, by statute, screen IST patients for security risks, and \n8  place a high security patient in the \"most secure facilities,\" such as DSH-Atascadero and DSH-\n9  Patton.  (Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 7225, 7228, 7230.)  Further, certain individual DSH facilities, \n10  DSH-Patton and DSH-Napa, are subject to population caps set by the Legislature.  (Welf. & Inst. \n11  Code,§ 4107, subd. (c) (DSH-Patton); § 7200.06 (DSH-Napa).)  The committing county must \n12  await DSH's completion of that screening function before delivering theIST defendant to DSH. \n13  (Pen. Code, § 1370, subd. (a)(3).)  In addition, DSH, and not the committing court, is the decision \n14  maker on the placement of the 1ST defendant in any particular DSH facility.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370, \n15  subd. (a)(5).)  Because each IST defendant presents unique competency training needs based on \n16  the causes of their incompetency, DSH seeks efficient utilization of its bed capacity but does not \n17  apply a fixed length of stay for IST defendants.  Hence, each 1ST defendant's admission date, \n18  once placement has been determined, is subject to DSH's discretionary management of its beds. \n19  3. .  There is no express timeframe for DSH's admission ofiST \ndefendants. \n20 \n21  Neither the state Constitution nor the statutory scheme of Penal Code section 1370 \n22  expressly state a timeframe for DSH to admit an IST defendant following issuance of a \n23  commitment order.  However, Penal Code section 13 70 does require DSH or any other provider \n24  to submit a progress report, concerning theIST defendant's likelihood of restoration, within 90 \n25  days of the commitment order.  (Pen. Code, §1370, subd. (b)(!).)  The Second District Court of \n26  Appeal found an 1ST defendant must be admitted to a treatment facility within a \"reasonable \n27  period of time\" following the commitment order, such that an adequate 90-day status report could \n28  be provided to the committing court.  (In re Mille, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 650.) \n5 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG15779731) \n\nI  The Legislature did not act, by A.B. 1468 or any other statute, to state a specific \n2  quantitative timeline for the admission ofiST defendants committed under Penal Code section \n3  1370.  The Legislature is \"presumed to know of existing domestic judicial decisions and to have \n4  them in mind when amending statutes which the courts have construed.\"  (Enyeart v. Bd. of \n5  Supervisors (1967) 66 Cal.2d 728, 735.)  When the Legislature enacted A.B. 1468, the \n6  Legislature was presumably aware of the judicial construction of Penal Code section 1370 to \n7  indicate a qualitative timeframe for admission in the decision of In re Mille, supra, and chose not \n8  to enact any amendments in response to that construction.  Therefore, the Mille decision's \n9  expression of a \"reasonable period of time\" for the admission of an IST defendant to DSH \n10  continues to stand.  (In re Mille, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 650.) \n11  B.  The Statutory Scheme For 1ST Defendants with Developmental \nDisabilities. \n12 \n1.  DDS is not the only placement option for PC 1370.1 1ST defendants. \n13 \n14  An IST defendant with developmental disabilities may be committed to ( 1) a state hospital, \n15  or (2) a developmental center for the care and treatment of the developmentally disabled, or (3) \n16  any other available residential facility approved by the director of a regional center for the \n17  developmentally disabled, or (4 ) be placed on outpatient status.  (Pen. Code, § 1370.1, subd. \n18  (a)(1)(B)(i).)  In addition, section 1370.1 provides for alternative (i.e., civil) commitment \n19  procedures if theIST defendant cannot attain competency.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370.1, subd. \n20  (a)(5)(A).)  Therefore, DDS is not the only entity that may provide competency training and \n21  evaluation to IST defendants with developmental disabilities. \n22  Further, the committing court may order a regional center to utilize private vendors to \n23  provide competency training and evaluation to an IST defendant with developmental disabilities. \n24  DDS \"contracts with private nonprofit corporations to establish and operate a network of21 \n25  regional centers that are responsible for determining eligibility, assessing needs, and coordinating \n26  and delivering direct services for developmentally disabled persons and their families.\"  (Michelle \n27  K  v. Super. Ct. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 409, 422; Capitol People First v. Dept. Developmental \n28  Services (2007)155 Cal.App.4th 676, 682-683.)  The regional centers' purpose is to \"assist \n6 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Supp01i of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  persons with developmental disabilities and their families in securing those services and supports \n2  which maximize opportunities and choices for living, working, learning, and recreating in the \n3  community.\"  (Welf. & Inst. Code,§ 4640.7, subd. (a).)  State funds are allocated \"to the centers \n4  for operations and the purchasing of services, including funding to purchase community-based \n5  services and supports.\"  (Capitol People, supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at p. 683, citing Welf. & Inst. \n6  Code, §§ 4620, 4621, 4787.)  Because the trial court has jurisdiction to order a regional center to \n7  provide secure competency training and evaluation by utilizing a private vendor, DDS does not \n8  have sole responsibility to provide such training and evaluation under Penal Code section 1370.1. \n9  2.  DDS has statutory discretion over the admission of IST defendants \nwith developmental disabilities. \n10 \n11  By statute, DDS has discretion to reject or delay the admission of an IST defendant \n12  committed to it.  All IST defendants committed to DDS, pursuant to Penal Code section 1370.1, \n13  must be placed in the secure treatment program at Porterville Developmental Center (Porterville). \n14  The Porterville secure treatment program is subject to a statutory population cap of211.  (Welf. \n15  & Inst. Code,§ 7502.5, subd. (a).)  To the extent the population cap is reached, DDS informs the \n16  committing court of its inability to admit IST defendants until others are discharged from \n17  Porterville. \n18  Moreover, DDS has the discretion to reject an IST defendant's placement at Pmierville on \n19  the basis of security issues and other patient health factors.  By statute, once DDS informs the \n20  trial court that an IST defendant cannot be safely served at Porterville, the court \"under no \n21  circumstances\" may order placement of that individual in the developmental center.  (Welf. & \n22  Inst. Code,§ 6510.5.)  Simply put, Penal Code section 1370.1 does \"not mandate placement at \n23  Porterville\" nor does it indicate Porterville as the \"sole placements for such defendants.\"  (In re \n24  Williams, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 1016.) \n25  3.  Penal Code 1370.1 does not state a quantitative timeframe for \nadmission ofiST defendants with developmental disabilities. \n26 \n27  Neither the state Constitution nor the statutory scheme of Penal Code section 1370.1 \n28  expressly state a quantitative timeframe for DDS to admit an IST defendant following issuance of \n7 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\nI  a commitment order.  Moreover, unlike Penal Code section 1370, the statutory scheme for \n2  developmentally disabled IST defendants does not require a 90-day progress report following the \n3  commitment order.  Rather, the initial progress report is due 90 days after admission of the \n4  developmentally disabled IST defendant, not the date of commitment.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370.1 \n5  subd. (b)(!).)  As a result, DDS must be found to have discretion over the precise admission date \n6  for each IST defendant with developmental disabilities. \n7  II.  THE PLAINTIFFS AND THEIR CAUSES OF ACTION \n8  The complaint asserts four causes of action: (I) violation of the right to due process, (2) \n9  denial of the right to a speedy trial, (3) violation of the Fomteenth Amendment, and (4) taxpayer \n10  claim.  The ACLU-Northern and the ACLU-Southern allege their status as non-profit \nII  organizations that \"pay California taxes each year.\"  (Complt., ~ 15.)  Their members pay \n12  \"California taxes every year.\"  (!d.)  The individual plaintiffs bring this complaint on the basis of \n13  a relative who was an IST defendant committed to DSH or DDS for competency training, as \n14  follows: \n15  ·Stephanie Stiavetti's brother, N, was committed to DSH on September 22,2014 and \n16  admitted to DSH on November 3, 2014.  (Complt., ~~[12, 35.) \n17  ·Kellie and Kimberly Bock's father, Rodney Bock, was found incompetent on Aprill9, \n18  2010, and committed suicide on April29, 2010 at Sutter County Jail.  (Complt., ~~ 13,50-5 1.) \n19  ·Nancy Leiva's son, A, was committed to DDS on December 6, 2012, and admitted to DDS \n20  on August 8, 2013.  (Complt., ~ 30.) \n21  ·Rosalind Randle's son, L, was committed in November 2013 to DDS, and admitted on \n22  October 14,2014 to an outpatient facility.  (Complt., ~~ 38, 39, 41.) \n23  LEGAL ARGUMENT \n24  I.  PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING TO BRING THE FIRST AND SECOND CAUSES OF \nACTION. \n25 \n26  Assuming arguendo plaintiffs' alleged taxpayer standing is limited to the fourth cause of \n27  action under 526a, then each of the plaintiffs must establish themselves as real pmties in interest \n28  for the first and second causes of action regm·ding the right to due process and the right to a \n8 \nDefendants' Memo, Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  . speedy trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 367.)  To pursue these state law causes of action, each plaintiff \n2  must show she \"has or will suffer particularized injury as a result of the enforcement\" of the \n3  challenged law.  (Connerly v. Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 748-749.)  Only the \n4  real party in interest has \"an actual and substantial interest in the subject matter of the action,\" \n5  and stands to be \"benefited or injured\" by a judgment in the action.  (Friendly Village Community \n6  Assn., Inc. v. Silva & Hill Constr. Co. (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 220, 225.) \n7  Plaintiffs cannot establish standing as IST defendants or as representatives of IST \n8  defendants to bring the first and second causes of action.  None of the individual plaintiffs allege \n9  that they were directly subject to IST proceedings as criminal defendants.  They do not allege \n10  representational capacity derived from appointment as guardian ad litem nor do they join their \n11  family members who were IST defendants as parties to this case.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 372, subd. \n12  (a)(!) & 373, subd. (c).)  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege representational capacity as a person \n13  \"expressly authorized by statute\" to bring suit on behalf of another, without joining the \n14  beneficiary to the action.  (!d. at§ 369, subd. (a)(4).)  l-Ienee the allegation that plaintiff Leiva is \n15  A's limited conservator is of no import as A is not a named plaintiff.  (Complt., ~ 29.)  Because \n16  plaintiffs fail to plead any facts demonstrating that they have legal representational capacity for \n17  non-related IST defendants, plaintiffs cannot plead a direct cause of action for violation of the \n18  right to due process and right to a speedy trial on behalf of any and all IST defendants. \n19  II.  THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT \nTO DUE PROCESS CANNOT PROCEED. \n20 \nA.  The Statutory Habeas Process Provides Due Process. \n21 \n22  The application of the due process clause of the California Constitution must be determined \n23  in the context of the individual's due process \"interest in freedom from arbitrary adjudicative \n24  procedures,\" and start \"with an assessment of what procedural protections are constitutionally \n25  required in light of the governmental and private interests at stake.\"  (People v. Ramirez (1979) \n26  25 Cal.3d 260, 263-264.)  Due process is a \"flexible concept,\" with the \"primary purpose\" of \n27  providing affected parties with \"the right to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \n28 \n9 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RGI5779731) \n\n1  manner.\"  (Ryan v.  Cal. Interscholastic Federation-San Diego Section (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th \n2  1048, 1072.) \n3  The habeas writ provides due process to review the \"lawfulness of a person's imprisonment \n4  or other restraint on ... liberty.\"  (In re Paul W. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 3 7, 53, quoting from \n5  Appeals & Writs in Criminal Cases (C.E.B. 2006) § 2.143, p. 484; Pen. Code, §1473.)  The \n6  habeas process, as codified in the Penal Code, affords all criminal defendants, including IST \n7  defendants, an appropriate means of challenging any admission timeftame.  (Pen. Code, § § 14 7 6-\n8  1480; Cal. Rules Ct., rule 4.551; see e.g. In re Mille, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th 635 [addressing \n9  habeas petition brought by IST defendant].)  Because the habeas process was available to the \n10  instant plaintiffs' IST defendants-relatives, with plaintiff Leiva's son actually filing a habeas \n11  petition contesting the timeframe of his admission, plaintiffs cannot claim any lack of due \n12  process.  (Complt., ~ 31.) \n13  Moreover, as the committing court retains jurisdiction to enforce its commitment orders, the \n14  IST defendants' interest in timely admission may be enforced through Order to Show Cause \n15  . (OSC) proceedings.  For instance, the admission of plaintiff Stiavetti's brother, N, was the subject \n16  of an OSC proceeding one month after the commitment order issued.  (Complt., ~ 35.)  The \n17  admission of plaintiff Leiva's son, A, was also the subject of an OSC proceeding.  (!d. at~ 31.) \n18  The availability, if not employment, of OSC proceedings and petitions for writs of habeas corpus \n19  therefore foreclose plaintiffs' first cause of action for due process. \n20  B.  Plaintiffs Stiavetti and Bock Cannot Establish a Due Process Violation. \n21  Plaintiffs Stiavetti and Bock cannot state a due process violation.  As stated above, Penal \n22  Code section 1370 does not provide a quantitative timeframe for admission.  The delivery of an \n23  IST defendant to DSI-I must occur within a \"reasonable period of time,\" such that an adequate 90-\n24  day status report could be provided to the committing court.  (In re Mille, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th \n25  at p. 650; People v. Brewer (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 122, 131.)  Even assuming arguendo a \n26  \"reasonable time\" indicates a 30-day timeframe for admission, Stiavetti's brother N- committed \n27 .  on September 22 and admitted on November 4 -was admitted within a constitutionally adequate \n28  timeframe.  (Complt., ~~ 12, 35.)  Plaintiffs Bock's father expired within ten days of his \n10 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support ofDemuner to Complaint (RGI5779731) \n\nI  commitment order, so plaintiffs Bock cannot claim a violation of any 30-day timeframe for \n2  admission.  (Jd. at,[~ 13, 35.)  Therefore, neither plaintiff Stiavetti nor plaintiffs Bock can pursue \n3  a due process violation arising from their relatives' commitments to DSH. \n4  III.  THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE STATE \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SPEEDY TRIAL Is NOT VIABLE. \n5 \nA.  No Private Right of Action to Enforce Another's Right to Speedy Trial. \n6 \n7  The comprehensive statutory scheme providing IST defendants with a speedy trial evinces \n8  no intent to provide a private cause of action.  Because a criminal statute can \"expressly or \n9  impliedly give rise to a private right of action for its violation,\" the determination of whether a \n10  private cause of action exists is a \"question of legislative intent.\"  (Animal Legal D~fense Fund v. \n11  Mendes (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 136, 141-142.)  That legislative intent is manifested in the \n12  enforcement mechanisms ofthe statutory scheme.  The Mendes court found no private cause of \n13  action to enforce Penal Code section 597t, an animal cruelty provision, reasoning, \"In light of the \n14  overall statutory scheme effectively 'deputizing' of humane societies to aid local authorities in the \n15  enforcement of anti-cruelty laws,\" it is clear \"the Legislature did not intend to create a private \n16  cause of action in other private entities.\"  (Id . at p. 142.)  This Court should extend the legislative \n17  analysis indicated in the Mendes decision and find the overall Penal Code scheme for ensuring a \n18  criminal defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial does not indicate any private cause of \n19  action . \n.2 0  Plaintiffs do not allege any language in the Penal Code provides them, as interested parties \n21  and/or family members, with the right to assert an IST defendant's constitutional speedy trial \n22  right.  Applying the Mendes analysis of legislative intent, the existence of three procedural \n23  mechanisms protecting the right to speedy trial precludes a private cause of action for denial of \n24  that right.  First, an IST defendant may move for dismissal of pending charges due to prejudicial \n25  and unjustified delays in bringing the case against a defendant to trial.  (People v. Martinez \n26  (2000) 22 Cal.4th 750,767, 769; Crafl v. Super. Ct. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1538, 1540-41 \n27  see also Pen. Code,§§ 1381-1383.)  If the trial court denies the motion, a defendant cm1 proceed \n28  to the appellate court by way of peremptory writ of mandate.  (Crcift, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at \n11 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  pp. 1536, 1538.)  Second, the defendant may bring a petition for writ of habeas corpus to \n2  challenge the basis for their continued confinement.  (In re Mille, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. \n3  640; In re Davis, supra, 8 Cal.3d at pp. 803, 810.) \n4  Third, these enforcement mechanisms may be brought not only by the criminal defendant \n5  on their own behalf, but also by their appointed counsel.  The trial court must appoint counsel on \n6  the defendant's behalf even where the criminal defendant is merely suspected of being. \n7  incompetent to stand trial and is not already represented.  (Pen. Code,§ 1368, subd. (a).)  Defense \n8  counsel may bring the above-indicated motions and writs to enforce the right to speedy trial on \n9  behalf ofiST defendants.  (Craft, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1538 fn. 1; Pen. Code, § 977.1) \n10  Given these statutory and procedural remedies for any violation of an IST defendant's right \nII  to a speedy trial, plaintiffs herein do not have a private cause of action to enforce that right on \n12  behalf of their family members who were IST defendants or on behalf of other unidentified IST \n13  defendants.  The demurrer to the second cause of action should therefore be sustained without \n14  leave to amend. \nIS  B.  Because the U.S. Constitution and State Law Direct a Stay of Criminal \nTrials Pending Competency Training, the Second Cause of Action Is \n16  Not Viable. \n17  Plaintiffs allege a cause of action for denial of the right to speedy trial without \n18  acknowledging that right is subordinate to the constitutional right to not undergo trial while \n19  incompetent.  The California Constitution provides criminal defendants with the right to a speedy \n20  trial.  (Cal. Const., mi. I,§ 15, cl. 1.)  However, it is \"well established\" that ongoing criminal \n21  prosecution of an incompetent defendant violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n22  Amendment.  (Medina v.  California (1992) 505 U.S. 437, 439.)  In accord, IST defendants have a \n23  right, under the federal due process clause and under state law, not to be tried while they are \n24  incompetent.  (People v. Sattiewhite (2014) 59 Cal.4th 446, 464.)  Criminal proceedings are \n25  initially suspended when a concern arises as to a defendant's competency to stand for trial.  (Pen. \n26  Code,§ 1367, subd. (a); see also Pen. Code,§ 1368, subd. (c).)  The stay continues after an \n27  affirmative determination of incompetency and corresponding commitment for treatment.  (Pen. \n28  Code,§§ 1370, subd. (a)(1)(B) & 1370.1, subd. (a)(l)(B).)  Therefore, as a matter of law, \n12 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\nI  plaintiffs cannot claim any denial of the right to speedy trial by alleged delays in admitting IST \n2  defendants to DSH or DDS for competency training. \n3  The question of whether theIST process in Penal Code section 1368 et seq. impinges on the \n4  state constitutional right to a speedy trial has been repeatedly answered in the negative.  Indeed, \n5  delays in criminal proceedings due to competency and other mental health proceedings are \n6  justified.  (People v. McGill (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 759,761 [finding good cause associated with \n7  delay in proceedings under Penal Code§ 1368].)  The California Supreme Court found no \n8  prejudicial delays resulting from the hospitalization ofiST defendants.  (In re Davis, supra, 8 \n9  Ca1.3d at p. 809.)  More recently, the appellate court stated that \"delay alone, even delay that is \nI 0  \"uncommonly long,\" is not enough to demonstrate prejudice\" sufficient to implicate the right to a \nII  speedy trial.  (Craft, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1542-1543, citing Martinez, supra, 22 Cal. 4th \n12  at p. 755.)  These decisions illustrate that not every delay, even one associated with theIST \n13  process, results in a violation of the right to a speedy trial.  Therefore, plaintiffs cannot state a \n14  cause of action on the basis that any delays in theIST process necessarily jeopardizes the right to \n15  a speedy trial. \n16  C.  Once Waived or Rejected, Speedy Trial Claims Cannot Be Revived. \n17  Enforcement of a defendant's right to speedy trial hinges on active assertion of the right. \n18  (People v.  Contreras (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1296, 1303.)  Specifically, a criminal defendant \n19  must timely object to any pertinent delay and follow the objection with a motion to dismiss the \n20  criminal charges.  (People v.  Wright (1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 389.)  Otherwise, the defendant will \n21  be deemed to have waived the right.  (Ibid.)  Even if timely raised, the trial court hearing the \n22  criminal matter is the arbiter of whether the prosecution established good cause for any \n23  prejudicial delay.  (Craft, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1540-41.)  The trial court's denial of the \n24  claim of violation ofthe right to speedy trial cannot, on the basis of res judicata, be revisited in \n25  this civil action.  (Cf. In re Crow (1971) 4 Cal.3d 613, 622, disapproved on other grounds in \n26  People v. Barragan (2004) 32 Cal.4th 236 [court's issuance of writ of habeas corpus on basis of \n27  violation of right to speedy trial given res judicata effect in subsequent criminal proceeding]; \n28  Buttimer v. Alexis (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 754 [county district attorney and State agency serve \n13 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RGI5779731) \n\n1  same public interest, so privity established for collateral estoppel effect of criminal court's \n2  ruling].) \n3  Plaintiffs provide no facts i·egarding whether the underlying 1ST patients or their counsels \n4  objected to unconstitutional delays in their cases proceeding to trial.  While the complaint \n5  references a habeas writ filed on behalf of plaintiff Leiva's son A, it provides no details regarding \n6  the grounds for the writ nor any final ruling by the trial court.  (Complt., ~ 31.)  The complaint is \n7  otherwise silent regarding any effort by the 1ST defendants or their counsels to assert the right to \n8  a speedy trial.  Indeed, the 1ST defendants may very well have waived or otherwise consented to \n9  certain delays.  (McGill, supra, 257 Cal.App.2d at p. 761 [defendant's consent presumed by lack \n10  of objection to setting of trial dates].)  Because the second cause of action lacks necessary facts \n11  concerning any 1ST defendant's timely assertion oftheir right to a speedy trial in the criminal \n12  court, the demurrer should be sustained on the bases of uncertainty and failure to state a cause of \n13  action. \n14  IV.  THE THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION \nCANNOT PROCEED AGAINST AHLIN AND ROGERS. \n15 \nPlaintiffs' third cause of action for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot state a \n16 \ncause of action.  A \"litigant complaining of a violation of a constitutional right\" has \"no cause of \n17 \naction directly under the United States Constitution,\" and instead must seek relief under 42 \n18 \nU.S.C. section 1983.  (Azul-Pacifica Inc. v.  City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 704, \n19 \n705.)  Because plaintiffs improperly assert a cause of action directly under the Fourteenth \n20 \nAmendment, their third cause of action fails to state a claim. \n21 \nEven assuming the third cause of action seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. section 1983, \n22 \nplaintiffs fail to establish the elements of a Section 1983 claim.  Plaintiffs must demonstrate the \n23 \nfollowing elements: (I) the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color \n24 \nof state law and that (2) the conduct deprived a person of a right, privilege, or immunity secured \n25 \nby the Constitution or by the laws of the United States.  (Parratt v.  Taylor (1981) 451 U.S. 527, \n26 \n535, overruled on other grounds in Daniels v.  Williams (1986) 474 U.S. 327; Crumpton v. Gates \n27 \n(1991) 947 F.2d 1418, 1420.)  Plaintiffs cannot establish these elements. \n28 \n14 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG15779731) \n\nI  A.  Ahlin and Rogers are Not Proper Defendants in the Fourteenth \nAinendirient Ch1hn. \n2 \n3  Section 1983 does not impose respondeat superior liability upon state officials, such as \n4  Ahlin and Rogers, for the actions of their employees.  (Mosher v. Saalfeld (9th Cir. 1978) 589 \n5  F.2d 438,441 ~~· cert. denied, 442 U.S. 941 (1979).  \"[A] plaintiff must plead that \n6  each government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated \n7  the Constitution.\"  (Ashcroft v. Iqbal, supra, 556 U.S. at p. 676.)  When a named defendant holds \n8  a supervisorial position, the causal link between him and the claimed constitutional violation must \n9  be specifically alleged.  (Leer v. Murphy (9th Cir. 1988) 844 F.2d 628, 633; Fayle v. Stapley (9th \n10  Cir. 1979) 607 F.2d 858, 862.)  The complaint must demonstrate that the supervising defendants \n11  either: personally participated in the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights; knew of the \n12  violations and failed to act to prevent them; or promulgated or \"implemented a policy so deficient \n13  that the policy 'itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights' and is 'the moving force of the \n14  constitutional violation.\"'  (Hansen v. Black (9th Cir. 1989) 885 F .2d 642, 646; Taylor v. List (9th \n15  Cir. 1989) 880 F.2d 1040, 1045.)  Vague and conclusory allegations concerning the involvement \n16  of official personnel in civil rights violations are not sufficient.  (Ivey v. Bd. ofR  egents of Univ. of \n17  Alaska (9th Cir. 1982) 673 F.2d 266, 268.) \n18  Plaintiffs' suit against Ahlin and Rogers in their official capacities is based on the erroneous \n19  assertion that Ahlin and Rogers' agencies, DSH and DDS, respectively have \"primary \n20  · responsibility for evaluating and treating\" IST defendants.  (Complt., ~~ 16, 17.)  By statute, the \n21  responsibility for initially evaluating a criminal defendant for incompetency rests with the trial \n22  court.  (Pen. Code,§§ 1368, 1370, subd. (a)(I)(B) & 1370.1, subd. (a)(l)(B).)  Further, by \n23  statute, the trial comt may order the county jail, or a community-based residential treatment \n24  facility, or any other public or private facility, or DSH to provide competency training to an IST \n_, __ l' ___ _1   1t with mental disorders.  (Pen. Code,§ 1370, subd. (a)(l)(B).). Depending upon any \nissues posed by an IST defendant with developmental disabilities, the trial court may \nnpetency training occur on an outpatient basis, in a residential facility approved by a \ncenter or at Porterville.  (Pen. Code, § 1370.1, subds. (a)(I)(B) & (E).)  The statutory \n15 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Suppmt of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  schemes therefore do not vest DSH and DDS with exclusive responsibility for providing \n2  competency training to IST defendants.  Hence, plaintiffs cannot assert Ahlin and Rogers are \n3  proper defendants in the Section 1983 claim on the basis of their agencies' statutory \n4  responsibilities. \n5  Moreover, the complaint's factual allegations do not establish Ahlin and Rogers' \n6  involvement in any constitutional violation.  The allegations concerning a February 2015 wait list \n7  for admission to DSH does not illuminate defendant Ahlin's role nor any alleged constitutional \n8  deprivation.  (Complt., ~ 42.)  Likewise, the allegations concerning an April2015 wait list for \n9  admission to a \"DDS hospital\" does not indicate defendant Roger's role nor any alleged \n10  constitutional deprivation.  (!d. at~ 43.)  The alleged conditions of confinement in various county \n11  jails do not establish any constitutional violation by Ahlin and Rogers, who are not alleged to \n12  have authority over county jails and their care ofiST defendants.  (!d. at~~ 16-17 & 44-53.) \n13  Given this paucity of proper allegations against Ahlin and Rogers, the demurrer should be \n14  sustained. \n15  B.  Defendants Ahlin and Rogers Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity. \n16  Defendants Ahlin and Rogers are entitled to qualified immunity to the Section 1983 claim. \n17  Immunity from liability under Section 1983 is governed by federal, not state law.  (Pitts v.  County \n18  ofK  ern (1998) 17 Cal.4th 340, 350.)  \"For executive officials in general, ... qualified immunity \n19  represents the norm.\"  (Harlow v. Fitzgerald (1982) 457 U.S. 800, 807.)  Qualified immunity \n20  turns upon two considerations: (1) whether the alleged facts made out a violation of a \n21  constitutional right; and (2) \"whether the right at issue was 'clearly established' at the time of \n22  defendant's alleged misconduct.\"  (Saucier v. Katz (2001) 533 U.S. 194, 201-202; Pearson v. \n23  Callahan (2009)  555 U.S. 223, 232, 236 [overruling holding in Saucier that the two-step inquiry \n24  must be conducted in sequence, with the second step dependent upon the first step].)  In other \n25  words, '\"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond \n26  debate.' \"(Carroll v.  Carman (2014)-U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 348, 350, quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd \n27  (2011) 563 U.S. 731, 13 S.Ct. 2074, 2083.) \n28 \n16 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Suppm1 of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  Given the pendency of appeals concerning the constitutional adequacy of court-ordered \n2  time frames for the admission of IST defendants to DSH facilities, it would not be clear to a \n3  reasonable person in defendant Ahlin and Roger's position that their conduct was unlawful in the \n4  circumstances.  To paraphrase the California Supreme Court, it would not be \"clear\" to a \n5  reasonable administrator that the existing timeframe for the admissions of IST defendants was \n6  \"unlawful.\"  (Venegas, supra, 32 Ca1.4th at p. 840.)  Ahlin and Rogers should therefore be \n7  granted immunity \"for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions.\"  (!d., citing Saucier, \n8  supra, 533 U.S. at p. 206.)  Because qualified immunity applies to Ahlin and Rogers' actions, the \n9.  Section 1983 action is subject to dismissal. \n10  V.  THE FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER SECTION 526A Is FLAWED. \n11  Plaintiffs Stiavetti, Bocks, Randle, ACLU-Southern, and ACLU-Northern fail to establish a \n12  cause of action under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a to \"obtain a judgment, restraining and \n13  preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to\" the funds of the state.  A Section \n14  526a claim cannot be stated where other enforcement mechanisms are available.  Moreover, \n15  plaintiffs' section 526a claim does not establish defendants engaged in unlawful acts of\"fraud, \n16  collusion, and ultra vires\" or failed to perfonn a legal duty.  (Ahlgren v.  Carr (1962) 209 \n17  Cal.App.2d 248, 253.)  Plaintiffs' do not show standing as taxpayers.  Therefore, the taxpayer \n18  claim cannot proceed. \n19  A.  The Taxpayer Claim Is Precluded by Penal Code Enforcement Avenues. \n20  Plaintiffs cannot employ Section 526a to enforce the Penal Code provisions concerning IST \n21  defendants' competency training when the Penal Code affords enforcement mechanisms.  The \n22  First District Court of Appeal recently ruled a taxpayer action could not proceed given the \n23  existence of a \"carefully crafted legislative mechanism for enforcing the Penal Code section \n24  plaintiffs claim defendants violated.\"  (Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v.  Cal. Exposition and \n25  State Fairs [Cal. Exposition] (Aug. 27, 2015)-Cal.App.4th -, 2015 WL 5050255.)  In Cal. \n26  Exposition, the appellate court determined an animal rights group could not bring a taxpayer \n27  action to enforce Penal Code section 597t because \"the comprehensive statutory scheme provides \n28  multiple avenues for the enforcement of California's animal cruelty laws,\" with both law \n17 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 1577973 I) \n\n1  enforcement and humane officials authorized to enforce the laws.  (!d. at p. *6.)  Moreover, as the \n2  California Supreme Court declared, \"[T]he appropriate tribunal for the enforcement of the \n3  criminal law is the court in an appropriate criminal proceeding.\"  (Nathan H  Schur, Inc. v. City of \n4  Santa Monica (1956) 47 Cal.2d 11,12-14, 17 [finding taxpayer action precluded by administrative \n5  hearing process].) \n6  Here, the competency training provisions of Penal Code sections 1370 and 1370.1 are \n7  subject to multiple entities and avenues of enforcement.  Multiple entities, such as IST \n8  defendants, their retained or appointed counsels, and judges may act to ensure an IST defendant is \n9  provided timely competency training.  Multiple procedures permit the assertion of any delay in \n10  restorative training, including habeas petitions, Orders to Show Cause, and motions to dismiss, as \n11  discussed above.  Hence, in accord with Cal. Exposition decision, this Court should find the \n12  existing enforcement mechanisms established by the Legislature, and \"the entities in whom it \n13  entrusted such enforcement,\" to be the exclusive means and persons charged with enforcing the \n14  right to competency training.  (Cal. Exposition, 2015 WL 5050255 at p. * 8.)  Therefore, the \n15  fourth cause of action should be dismissed. \n16  B.  Plaintiffs Lack Taxpayer Standing for the Fourth Cause of Action. \n17  To establish standing under Section 526a, plaintiffs must allege payment of taxes that are \n18  \"assessed,\" such as ad valorem taxes on real or personal property.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 526a; \n19  Blair v. Pitchess (1971) 5 Ca1.3d 258,269 fn. 2; Reynolds v.  City ofC  alistoga (2014) 223 \n20  Cal.App.4th 865, 872 [payment of sales tax insufficient].)  Indeed, the appellate courts have twice \n21  held that payment of property taxes is required for taxpayer standing m1der section 526a.  (Torres \n22  v. City of Yorba Linda (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1047-1048 [sales tax insufficient]; Cornelius \n23  v. Los Angeles County etc. Authority (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1775-1779 [payment of \n24  gasoline and state income tax insufficient].)  A plaintiffs lack of taxpayer standing, whether \n25  apparent from the face of the complaint or from judicially noticed matters, constitutes a failure to \n26  state a claim.  (County ofF  resno v. Shelton (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 996, 10 09.)  The individual \n27  plaintiffs and the two ACLU organizations herein do not establish Section 526a standing. \n28 \n18 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  The complaint does not establish the taxpayer stattJS of the individual plaintiffs bringing \n2  this cause of action.  Plaintiffs Randle, Stiavetti, and Bocks alleged payment of \"income and other \n3  state and local taxes\" is vague as to their payment of assessed (property) taxes imposed by the \n4  State of California.  (Complt., ~~ 12-14.)  Likewise, plaintiffs ACLU-Southern California and \n5  ACLU-Northern California assert they \"pay California taxes each year,\"  without specifying the \n6  type of taxes paid.  (Jd. at~ 15.) \n7  Moreover, both plaintiff organizations, ACLU-Northern California and ACLU-Southern \n8  . California, are tax-exempt and thus cannot allege the payment of the requisite ad valorem taxes \n9  for Section 526a standing.  Plaintiff ACLU of Northern California (ACLU-NC) describes itself as \n10  a separate entity distinct from the ACLU Foundation.  (Exh. 6, ACLU-NC 2014 Annual Report, \n11  p. 26; Req. J. Not.)  The ACLU Foundation is described as the entity that \"conducts litigation and \n12  public education\" as a 501(c)(3) \"tax-exempt organization.\"  (Jd.)  In contrast, plaintiff ACLU-\n13  NC is described as the entity that \"conducts membership outreach, organizing, legislative \n14  advocacy, and lobbying,\" with 50l(c )(4) status as a \"tax-exempt organization.\"  (Jd.)  ACLU-NC \n15  is listed as a tax exempt organization by the State Franchise Tax Board.  (Exh. 8, Excerpted Page, \n16  Franchise Tax Board Exempt Organization List, p. 365; Req. J.  Not.)  Therefore, ACLU-NC \n17  cannot serve as a proper Section 526a plaintiff on the basis of its alleged payment of California \n18  taxes each year. \n19  Plaintiff ACLU of Southern California (ACLU-SC) also describes itself as distinct from the \n20  ACLU Foundation.  (Exh. 7, ACLU-SC 2013-14 Annual Report, p. 16; Req. J. Not.)  \"The \n21  ACLU of Southern California is comprised of two separate corporate entities, the American Civil \n22  Liberties Union and the ACLU Foundation, each with its own board of directors.\"  (!d. at p. 15.) \n23  The ACLU Foundation is described as a 501(c)(3) entity, with finances separate from those of \n24  ACLU-SC.  (Jd. at p. 16.)  Litigation is \"handled exclusively by the ACLU Foundation and \n25  lobbying by the ACLU.\"  (Id. at p. 15.)  ACLU-SC is listed as an \"active\" tax exempt \n26  organization by the State Franchise Tax Board.  (Exh. 8, Excerpted Page, Franchise Tax Board \n27  Exempt Organization List, p. 366; Req. J. Not.)  Therefore, the ACLU-SC cannot serve as a \n28  Section 526a plaintiff based on the allegation it pays California taxes each year.  Indeed, both \n19 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  ACLU plaintiffs are estopped from asserting Section 526a taxpayer standing to sue on their own \n2  behalf.  (Drain. supra, 69 Cal.App.4th at p. 961; Prilliman, supra, 53 Cal. App.4th at pp. 957-\n3  960.) \n4  Even if an organization does not pay taxes in its own right, it may have standing to bring a \n5  taxpayer action if at least one of its members would have standing to bring the action as an \n6  individual.  (Gilbane Bldg. Co. v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1531.)  Both ACLU-\n7  Southern California and ACLU-Northern California allege that \"many of its members are \n8  assessed and pay California taxes.\"  (Complt., ~15.) This allegation does not indicate that at least \n9  one member qualifies as a taxpayer by paying assessed (property) taxes, therefore neither \n10  organization has representational standing.  Because the plaintiffs bringing the Section 526a claim \n11  -Randle, Stiavetti, Bocks, ACLU-Southern California, and ACLU-Northern California-fail to \n12  establish taxpayer standing, the demurrer to the Section 526a claim should be sustained. \n13  C.  No Illegal and/or Wasteful Expenditure Is Alleged. \n14  Plaintiffs' taxpayer claim is based on the single assertion that defendants are \"illegally \n15  expending public funds by performing their duties in violation\" of the referenced constitutional \n16  provisions is insufficient to state a cognizable taxpayer claim.  (Complt., ~ 67 .)  There are no \n17  \"specific facts and reasons for a beliefthat some illegal expenditure or injury to the public fisc is \n18  occurring or will occur.\"  (Waste Management ofA  lameda County, Inc. v.  County ofA  lameda \n19  (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1240.)  \"General allegations, innuendo, and legal conclusions are \n20  not sufficient\" to establish illegal expenditure of public funds.  (Ibid.)  Having failed to allege \n21  specific facts of illegal spending, none of the plaintiffs have standing to bring a taxpayer action. \n22  (Imagistics Intern. Inc. v.  Dept. ofG  eneral Services (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 581, 594.) \n23  To the extent plaintiffs' taxpayer claim asserts waste, the claim is still insufficient.  The \n24  term \"waste\" under section 526a \"means something more than an alleged mistake of public \n25  officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.\"  (Sundance v. \n26  Municipal Ct. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 1101, 1138.)  Section 526a does not encompass \"disputes which \n27  are primarily political in nature,\" so the trial court should reject a Section 526a claim premised \n28  upon a taxpayer's mere disapproval of an expenditure.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiffs do not allege \n20 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  unnecessary public spending, but unnecessary delays in their family member's receipt of \n2  competency care.  As a result, plaintiffs do not state a cause of action under Section 526a for \n3  illegal or wasteful spending. \n4  D.  A Taxpayer Claim Cannot Be Based on State Officials' Discretionary \nActs. \n5 \nPlaintiffs do not allege any acts of fraud or ultra vires by these state officials-defendants. \n6 \nTo the extent the section 526a claim is based upon an alleged violation of a legal duty, the Section \n7 \n526a claim cannot proceed in light of defendants' statutory discretionary over admissions of IST \n8 \ndefendants. \n9 \nA Section 526a action may only be brought if a government entity or agency official has a \n10 \n\"duty to act, and refused to do so,\" as opposed to discretion to act.  (California Assn. for Safety \n11 \nEducation v. Brown (1994) 30 Cai.App.4th 1264, 1281.)  Indeed, \"the court is prohibited from \n12 \nsubstituting its discretion for the discretion\" of the government entity or agency official.  (Ibid.) \n13 \nPlaintiffs' requested relief, namely judicial oversight and orders to control the executive branch's \n14 \ndiscretion to determine the specific time frames for admitting IST defendants runs foul of this rule. \n15 \nAs discussed above, the defendants have statutory discretion regarding the timeframe for \n16 \nadmissions.  Given section 526a \"should not be applied to principally 'political' issues involving \n17 \nthe exercise of the discretion of either the legislative or executive branches of government\" (id.) \n18 \nthis Comt \"risk[s ] trespassing into the domain oflegislative or executive discretion\" by \n19 \npermitting this complaint to proceed.  (Sagaser v. McCarthy (1986) 176 Cai.App.3d 288, 310-\n20 \n311.)  This demmrer should be sustained because the complaint, and its sought relief, exceeds the \n21 \n\"limits\" of Section 526a.  (Humane Soc. of U.S. v. State Bd. ofE  qualization (2007) 152 \n22 \nCai.App.4th 349, 356.) \n23 \nVI.  THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT A J>ROPER DEFENDANT. \n24 \nA.  The State is Not a Proper Defendant in the State Law Claims. \n25 \nBy naming the State of California as a defendant, the complaint contains \"a defect or \n26 \nmisjoinder of parties.\" (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (d).)  Plaintiffs cannot obtain \n27 \nmandamus, injunctive or declaratory relief against the State of California.  Nor can plaintiffs \n28 \n21 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\nI  bring a taxpayer claim against the State of California.  Therefore, the State of California's \n2  demurrer should be sustained without leave to amend. \n3  The California Supreme Court declared that claims for writ or injunctive relief cannot \n4  proceed against the State of California, as distinct from an agency or officer.  (State v. Super. Ct. \n5  (1974) 12 Cal.3d 237, 255.)  In State v. Superior Court, developers sued the State, California \n6  Coastal Zone Conservation Commission, and two Commission employees, seeking a writ of \n7  mandate, declaratory, and injunctive relief, based on the denial of a permit and the alleged \n8  unconstitutionality of the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act.  The court sustained the \n9  State's demurrer because the plaintiffs made no allegations establishing any right to relief against \n10  the State \"as distinguished from the Commission acting as its agent.\"  (!d. at p. 255.)  Because the \n11  State of California can only act through its agencies and officers, it is not a proper party defendant \n12  from which mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief may be obtained in this matter. \n13  A taxpayer action may only be \"maintained against any officer\" of the involved state or \n14  local agency.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 526a.)  In accord with this statutory language, the courts have \n15  determined that taxpayer suits must be brought against a state agency or officer with \n16  administrative authority over the challenged action, not the State of California.  (Ahlgren v. Carr, \n17  supra, 209 Cal.App.2d at p. 256 [action to enjoin State Director of Finance and Controller from \n18  purchasing textbooks]; Farley v.  Cory (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 583, 589 [action against State \n19  Controller to compel exercise of discretion over money due the state].) Therefore, the State of \n20  California's demurrer to each state law claim should be sustained, and the State of California \n21  dismissed from this action. \n22  B.  The State of California is Not a Proper Defendant in a Section 1983 \nClaim. \n23 \n24  \"Under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the doctrine of \n25  sovereign immunity, the state is absolutely immune from tort liability under the federal civil \n26  rights act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).\" (Venegas, supra, 32 Ca1.4th at p. 826.)  Further, the State of \n27  California is not considered a 'person' for purposes of Section 1983.  (Bougere v. County ofL  os \n28  Angeles (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 237, 242; Will v. Michigan  Dept. ofS tate Police (1989) 491 \n22 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG15779731) \n\n1  U.S. 58, 62, 66, 71.)  Because plaintiffs cannot plead a viable Section 1983 claim against the State \n2  of California, this Court should sustain the demurrer without leave to amend as to the Section \n3  1983 claim against the State of California.  ( Catsouras v. Dept. Cal. Highway Patrol (20 10 ) 181 \n4  Cal.App.4th 856, 892.) \n. 5  VR No MANDAMUS CAUSE OF ACTION SUPPORTS MANDAMUS RELIEF. \n6  Plaintiffs seek mandamus relief in their prayer for relief, yet fail to properly present any \n7  cause of action for mandamus.  The complaint fails to contain \"a statement of the facts \n8  constituting the [mandamus] cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.\" (Code Civ. \n9  Proc., § 425.1 0.)  Plaintiffs' failure to separately state a mandamus cause of action indicates the \n10  mandamus cause of action is improperly subsumed within another cause of action.  (Cal. Rules \n11  Ct., rule 2.112.)  \"[P]leadings which jumble together several distinct causes of action may be \n12  subject to demurrer for uncertainty.\"  (Cal. Practice Guide: Cal.  Civ. Proc. Before Trial (2015) \n13  Ch. 6-B, § 6:104.)  Plaintiffs' mandamus claim fails to comport with pleading standards; hence \n14  the mandamus claim is subject to demurrer. \n15  To the extent the complaint is broadly construed to allege a cause of action for mandamus, \n16  plaintiffs have not alleged the elements for the mandamus cause of action.  Plaintiffs do not \n17  establish \"(1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty\" on the part of the defendants; and \"(2) \n18  a clear, present and beneficial right\" in the plaintiffs \"to the performance of that duty.\"  (City of \n19  Dinuba v. County ofTulare (2007) 41 Cal.4th 859, 868.)  There is no ministerial duty because, as \n20  discussed above, the statutory schemes do not require DSH and DDS to always admit IST \n21  defendants and do provide Ahlin and Rogers with discretion over the admission and placement of \n22  IST defendants.  A writ cannot be used to control a matter of discretion vested in a state official. \n23  (Kaiser Foundation Hospitals v. Belshe (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1558.)  \"Where a statute \n24  leaves room for discretion, a challenger must show the official acted arbitrarily, beyond the \n25  bounds of reason or in derogation of the applicable legal standards.\"  (Cal. Correctional \n26  Supervisors Organization, Inc. v. Dept. ofC  orrections (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 824, 827.) \n27  These individual and organizational plaintiffs cannot establish a present and beneficial right \n28  to performance of any admission duty under Penal Code sections 1370 and 1370.1.  The \n23 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  individual plaintiffs are family members of IST defendants whose admission is no longer in \n2  controversy.  The organizational plaintiffs do not allege any members are IST defendants or.will \n3  be IST defendants in the future.  The demurrer should be sustained because plaintiffs are not real \n4  parties in interest for standing under Code of Civil Procedure section 367. \n5  Any allegations that defendants have a ministerial duty in their implementation of Penal \n6  Code sections 1370 and 1370.1 must fail as a matter oflaw.  Plaintiffs cannot show that \n7  defendants Ahlin and Rogers' statutory discretion in implementing Penal Code section 1370 and \n8  1370.1, respectively, equates to \"ministerial acts.\"  The statutory schemes do not require Ahlin or \n9  Rogers to admit IST defendants in a prescribed, quantitative timeframe set by any law, \"without \n10  regard to his or her own judgment or opinion concerning the propriety of such act.\"  (Coachella \n11  Valley Unified School Dist. v. State (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 93, 113 [citations omitted].) \n12  Moreover, the demurrer should be sustained in the absence of any affirmative allegations that \n13  plaintiffs have the requisite beneficial interest to prosecute a mandamus action.  Given the \n14  plaintiffs carmot state a cause of action for mandamus, the demurrer to any apparent mandamus \n15  cause of action should be sustained and the prayer for mandamus relief struck. \n16  VIII. LEIVA AND BOCK'S CLAIMS ARE UNTIMELY, \n17  Plaintiffs Leiva and Bock have not met the applicable two-year limitations period for \n18  bringing their state law and federal claims concerning their relatives who were IST defendants. \n19  The two-year statute oflimitations applies to state constitutional claims.  (Code Civ. Proc., \n20  § 335.1.) A state cause of action accrues at \"the time when the cause of action is complete with \n21  all of its elements.\"  (Fox v.  Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 807.)  The state \n22  limitations period \"ordinarily commences at the time when the obligation or liability arises, \n23  regardless of the plaintiff's ignorance of the cause of action.\"  (Utility Audit Co. v.  City ofL  os \n24  Angeles (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 950, 962.) \n25  Federal law determines the accmal date for federal claims.  (Maldonado v. Harris (9th Cir. \n26  2004) 370 F.3d 945, 955.)  Unless a federal statute provides otherwise, a federal claim accrues \n27  \"when the plaintiff !mows, or should know, of the injury which is the basis of the cause of \n28  action.\"  (Ibid.)  While Congress has provided no federal statute of limitations governing Section \n24 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  1983 claims, the United States Supreme Court has held that federal courts should use the forum \n2  state's statute oflimitations applicable to personal injury actions for all section 1983 claims. \n3  (Wilson v. Garcia (1985) 471 U.S. 261, 269.)  For Section 1983 claims arising in California on or \n4  after January I, 2003, that period is two years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1; Maldonado, supra, \n5  370 F.3d at pp. 954-955.) \n6  Plaintiffs Leiva and Bock knew or should have known of the facts essential to their claims \n7  over two years before the filing of this complaint.  The necessary facts for Leiva to bring suit \n8  were apparent when her son, A, was not admitted to DDS within 30 days of his December 6, 2012 \n9  commitment order.  (Complt.,, 30.)  The essential facts for Kellie and Kimberly Bock's claim \n10  were apparent on the date of Mr. Bock's death, April29, 2010.  (!d. at, 13; Exh. 4, Fourth Am. \n11  Complt., ,, 107-111, Estate ofB  ock v.  County ofS utter, U.S.D.C. Eastern, case 2: 11-cv-00536 \n12  MCE/KJN; Exh. 5, Aug. 31, 2012 Memo. Decision, Estate ofB  ock, supra, Req. J. Not.)  Because \n13  more than two years have passed since plaintiffs Leiva and plaintiffs Bocks learned the facts \n14  essential to their claims, their state and federal claims are barred by the limitations period. \n15  Plaintiffs Leiva and Bock should therefore be dismissed from this action. \n16  IX.  PLAINTIFFS KELLIE AND KIMBERLY BOCK IMPROPERLY SPLIT THEIR CLAIM. \n17  A.  The Primary Right Cannot Be Split into Two Lawsuits. \n18  To define a cause of action, California follows the primary right theory.  (Citizens for Open \n19  Access to Sand and Tide, Inc. v. Seadrift Assn., Inc. (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1053, 1067.)  The \n20  primary right theory \"provides that a \"cause of action\" is comprised of a \"primary right\" of the \n21  plaintiff, a corresponding \"primary duty\" of the defendant, and· a wrongful act by the defendant \n22  constituting a breach of that duty.\"  (Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Ca1.4th 666, 681.)  The \n23  \"violation of a single prima1·y right gives rise to but a single cause of action.\"  (!d.) \n24  Plaintiffs Kellie a11d Kimberly Bock cannot split their cause of action concerning the failure \n25  to timely transfer their father to DSH by first suing in federal court for recovery of monetary \n26  dllillages arising from his death and then suing in state court for equitable relief concerning his \n27  death.  Before bringing this action, Kellie and Kimberly Bock brought suit in 2011 on the same \n28  facts -the failure to timely transfer their father fi·om county jail to DSH caused his death-in \n25 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Support of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  federal court.  (Exh. 4, Fourth. Am. Complt., ~~ 107-111, Estate ofB  ock, supra; Exh. 9, Docket, \n2  Estate ofB  ock, supra; Exh. 5, Aug. 31,2012 Memo. Decision, Estate ofBocl~ supra, pp. 13-14.) \n3  The Bocks brought their federal suit against the Department of Mental Health (DMH was the \n4  predecessor to DSH), Cliff Allenby, then-Director ofDMH, and Dolly Matteucci, Executive \n5  Director ofDSH-Napa.  (Exh. 9, Docket, Estate ofB ock, supra.)  However, the Bocks dropped \n6  Allenby and Matteucci from the action on May 26,2011, with the filing of their first amended \n7  complaint, and dropped DMH from the action on March 12, 2012, with the filing of their third \n8  amended complaint.  (Ibid.) \n9  The Bocks focused their federal action against Sutter County defendants, contending, \n10  \"Napa State Hospital had notified Sutter County that Decedent was approved for admission and \n11  that each Defendant had been informed of such approval.  These Defendants nonetheless failed to \n12  timely effectuate Decedent's transfer.\"  (Exh. 4, Fourth Am. Complt., ,1~ 107-111, Estate ofBock, \n13  supra, Exh. 5, Aug. 31,2012 Memo. Decision, p. 14, Estate ofB ock, supra, [discussing third am. \n14  complt.]; Req. J. Not.) No relief was then sought against the DMH, the Director ofDMH or the \n15  Executive Director ofDMH-Napa.  (Exh. 4, Fourth. Am. Complt., ~~ 107-111, Estate ofB  ock v. \n16  County ofS utter, supra.)  The Bocks settled their federal wrongful death action with Sutter \n17  County in June 2014.  (Exh. 9, Docket, Estate ofB  ock, supra.)  The Bocks chose their federal \n18  court action as the avenue for addressing their primary right, and must be held to that choice.1 \n19  Defendant Ahlin's demurrer to the Bocks' complaint and each and every cause of action should \n20  therefore be sustained without leave to amend. \n21  B.  Kellie and Kimberly Bock are Estopped from Asserting DSH Delayed \nin Admitting their Father. \n22 \n23  Because plaintiffs Kellie and Kimberly Bocks' allegations in this complaint are inconsistent \n24  with the allegations in their federal action against the County of Sutter for their father's death, \n25  their claim is barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel.  (Drain, supra, 69 Cal. App. 4th at p. \n26  1 The Bocks were represented in their federal wrongful death action by Michael Bien, Esq., \nwho obtained long-standing equitable relief against the California Department of Corrections \n27  concerning its care of mentally ill inmates, and three other law firms.  (See Coleman v.  Wilson \n(1995) 912 F.Supp. 1282.) \n28 \n26 \nDefendants' Memo. Pts. & Authorities In Suppmt of Demurrer to Complaint (RG 15779731) \n\n1  961; Prilliman, supra, 53 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 957-960.)  In this action, the Bocks indicate their \n2  father, Rodney Bock, was not timely transferred to DSH.  (Complt., ~ 13.)  However, in their \n3  federal complaint against only Sutter County defendants, the Bocks averred that DSH authorized \n4  admission of their father yet the County defendants failed to deliver him to DSH-Napa.  (Exh. 4, \n5  Fourth. Am. Bock Complaint,~~ 107-111.)  This Comi should apply the doctrine of judicial \n6  estoppel and find the Bocks' inconsistent allegations warrant dismissal of their claims without \n7  leave to amend. \n8  CONCLUSION \n9  The complaint is substantively flawed on numerous grounds, ranging from failing to state a \nI 0  cause of action to failing to establish standing.  For all the reasons stated, defendants' demurrer \n11  should be sustained, with dismissal of the State of California from the action. \n12 \nDated:  October 1, 2015  Respectfully Submitted, \n13 \nKAMALA D.

INTRODUCTION \nI \n3  1.  Criminal defendants who have been found incompetent to stand trial have a constitutional \n4  right to adequate and timely evaluation and, where possible, treatment to restore them to competency so \n5  that they may proceed to trial or otherwise resolve their charges. \n6  2.  In California these individuals languish in jail for months even after the court has ordered \n7  them coqunitted for competency restoration, usually without adequate treatment for their serious mental \n8  illnesses and in conditions that worsen their mental states and place them in danger.  It is often only \n9  when a judge threatens to hold the state officials in contempt for failing to obey the commitment order \n10  that the defendant is fmaUy admitted to an appropriate treatment facility. \n11  3.  This problem has persisted for years, even after California and federal appellate courts \n12  have held that these types of delays are unlawful and countless superior court judges have ordered \n13  Defendants to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for failing to admit incompetent \n14  defendants to an appropriate treatment facility in a timely manner. \n15  4.  As of February 9, 2015, 366 incompetent defendants were awaiting admission to the \n16  Department of State Hospitals (\"DSH\"), which has the primary responsibility for evaluating and treating \n17  defendants who are incompetent because of a mental disorder.  Some of these individuals had been \n18  waiting in jail for more than five months-one of them had been waiting for 258 days. The average \n19  time between tlie commitment date and the admission date for the previous 25 persons admitted as of \n20  February 9 was more than 75 days. \n21  5.  The delays in admitting people with developmental disabilities are even longer. The \n22  Department of Developmental Services (\"DDS\") has the primary responsibility for evaluating and \n23  treating defendants who are incompetent because of a developmental disability. DDS recently reported \n24  that \"an estimated 52 individuals who have been issued court orders to receive competency training ... \n25  continue to be in jail or juvenile hall, pending availability of services at Porterville's [Secure Treatment \n26  Program].\" As of April 2, 2015, 11 individuals had been waiting for more than nine months following \n27  their commitment, two of them for 384 days. \n28 \n1 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  6.  These delays are on top of the time that passes between the date that defendants are \nI \n2  initially suspected as being incompetent and the date that DSH or DDS first has a duty to admit them. \n3  This additional time is usually at least a month and can be much longer. \n4  7.  While awaiting placement in State hospitals or developmental centers, incompetent \n5  defendants are held in county jails. Those jails are rarely, if ever, equipped to treat individuals with \n6  serious mental illnesses or to care for individuals with developmental disabilities. Incompetent \n7  defendants are often held in solitary confinement because of their mental condition-a situation that \n8  often exacerbates the prisoner's mental conditions, causes deterioration of their mental health, and \n9  decreases the chances that they will achieve competency to proceed with their cases in a timely manner. \n10  In addition, incompetent defendants' mental conditions sometimes lead to physical conflict with jail \n11  personnel, endangering the safety ofbothjail staff and the inmates and sometimes leading to additional \n12  criminal charges. \n13  8.  Plaintiffs, who are the family members of criminal defendants who have been found \n14  incompetent to stand trial, bring this suit to put an end to this ongoing violation of the California and \n15  federal constitutions. \n16  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17  9.  This Court has jurisdiction under Article VI, Section 10, of the California Constitution \n18  and California Code of Civil Procedure§ 410.10. \n19  10.  Venue in this Court is proper because this is an action against Pamela Ahlin and Santi J. \n20  Rogers in their official capacities for acts they performed as part of their public duties that caused, and \n21  will continue to cause, legal injuries and deprivation of rights to persons in Alameda County. See id \n22  §§ 393(b), 395(a). In addition, because these directors reside in Sacramento and are unlawfully \n23  spending taxpayer funds in that county, venue in this Court is proper because the California Attorney \n24  General maintains an office in Alameda County. ld §§ 393(b), 395(a), 401(1). \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCilVE RELIEF \n\nm. \nPARTIES \n2  11.  PlaintiffN  ancy Leiva is the mother ofA   1, a criminal defendant who was determined \n3  incompetent to stand trial and ordered transferred to the DDS Porterville as is discussed below. A was \n4  detained in Los Angeles County jail for approximately eight months after the com1 ordered him \n5  admitted to Porterville.  While awaiting admi~ion to Porterville, A was the victim of multiple rapes at \n6  the county jail. \n7  12.  Plaintiff Stephanie Stiavetti is the sister ofN. a criminal defendant who was determined \n8  incompetent to stand trial and ordered transferred to DSH as is discussed below. N was detained at \n9  Contra Costa County Jail for more than four weeks after his order of commitment before he was \n10   transferred to DSH.  Ms. Stiavetti pays income and other state and local taxes. \n11  13.  Plaintiffs Kellie Bock and Kimberly Bock are daughters of the late Rodney Bock, a \n12  criminal defendant who was determined incompetent to stand trial and ordered transferred to DSH as is \n13  discussed below. Mr. Bock committed suicide while he was detained at Sutter County Jail, 10 days after \n14  the court had committed him to DSH. Kellie Bock and Kimberly Bock pay income and other state and \n15  local taxes. \n16  14.  Plaintiff Rosalind Randle is the mother of L, a criminal defendant who was determined \n17  incompetent to stand trial and ordered transferred to the DDS center at Porterville, CA, as is discussed \n' \n18  below. L was <!etained at Contra Costa County Jail for approximately 12 months after being committed \n19  to Porterville and was finally transferred to outpatient treatment.  Ms. Randle pays income and other \n20  state and local taxes. \n21  15.  The American Civil Liberties Union is a nationwide nonprofit, nonpartisan organization \n22  with over 500,000 members, dedicated to the defense and promotion of the guarantees of individual \n23  rights and liberties embodied in the state and federal constitutions.

The \n4  ACLU-SC and many of its members are assessed and pay California taxes every year. \n5  16.  Defendant Pamela Ahlin is the director of DSH. DSH is a California agency comprising \n6  five state hospitals and three psychiatric programs located in state prisons. DSH bas the primary \n7  responsibility for evaluating and treating defendants who have been found incompetent to stand trial \n8  because of a mental disorder through the California criminal justice system. Defendant Ahlin is named \n9  in her official capacity only. \n10  17.  Defendant Santi J. Rogers is the director ofDDS. DDS is a California agency that \n11  provides services and support for approximately 228,000 children and adults with developmental \n12  disabilities and has the primary responsibility for evaluating and treating defendants who have been \n13  found incompetent to stand trial because of a developmental disability through the California criminal \n14  justice system.  Defendant Rogers is named in his official capacity only. \n15  18.  Defendant State of California has the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the \n16  constitutional and statutory rights of defendants, including incompetent defendants, in its criminal \n17  justice system are protected and upheld. \n18  IV.  STATEMENTOFFACTS \n19  A.  TI he Statutory and Coostitutiooal Framework \n20  19.  Both due process and California statutory law mandate that a criminal defendant who, \n21  because of a mental disorder or a developmental disability, lacks the ability to assist counsel and to \n22  understand the nature of the criminal court proceedings cannot be tried or sentenced for a crime. See \n23  Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164, 169-70 (2008); Penal Code§ 1367(a). To implement this \n24  constitutional mandate, the California Penal Code sets forth a comprehensive framework for evaluating \n25  a defendant's competency and monitoring his progress, and either retmning a defendant to trial or, if he \n26  cannot be made competent, for civilly committing the defendant or releasing him. \n27 \n28 \n4 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND 1NJUNC11VE RELIEF \n\n·1   20.  The Code defines \"developmental disability'\" to mean \"a disability that originates before \n' 2  an individual attains 18 years of age, continues, or can be expected to ,continue, indefinitely and \n3  constitutes a substantial handicap for the individual, ... [including] intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, \n4  epilepsy, and autism.\" Penal Code§ 1370.1(a)(l){H). The Code does not define \"mental disorder,\" but \n5  the constitutional mandate means that this term must include all other conditions that render a defendant \n6  incompetent to stand trial. \n7  21__.  Penal Code § 1368(a) provides that \"[i]f, during the pendency of an action and prior to \n8  judgment, or during revocation proceedings for a violation of probation, mandatory supervision. post-\n9  release community supervision, or parole, a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental \n10   competence of the defendant, he or she shall state that doubt in the record and inquire of the attorney for \n11  the defendant whether, in the opinion of the attorney, the defendant is mentally competent.\" \n12  22.  If, after a trial or by stipulation, the defendant is found mentally incompetent or \n13  developmentally disabled, the trial court must suspend criminal proceedings and either order that the \n14  defendant be admitted to a treatment facility to \"promote the defendant's speedy attainment of mental \n15  competence,\" or place the defendant on outpatient status.  Penal Code§§ 1370(a)(l)(B), \n16  1370.1(a)(1)(B). \n17  23.  The treatment facility then must evaluate the defendant and provide the court with a \n18  report \"concerning the defendant; s progress toward becoming mentally competent., Penal Code \n19  §§ 1370(b)(l), t370.1(b)(l). The facility must make this report within 90 days ofthe order of \n20  commitment or the date of admission. Penal Code§§ 1370(b)(1), 1370.1(b)(l). \n21  24.  If the report shows that the defendant has been restored to competency, he is returned to \n22  court within ten days so that criminal proceedings can resume. Penal Code §§ 1372(a); see \n23  § 1370.l(a)(l)(C). Ifthe defendant has not_become mentally competent, but the report shows a \n24  substantial likelihood that he will become competent, treatment may continue. Penal Code \n25  §§ 1370(b)(l), 1370.1(b)(l). \n26  25.  If the facility determines that \"there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant will \n27  regain mental competence in the foreseeable future,\" it must return him to court so that the court and \n28 \n5 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTNE RELIEF \n\n, 1  prosecution can determine whether to institute civil commitment proceedings or release him from \n'  2  custody.  See id §§ 1370(b)(lXA), 1370.l(b)(l), (cX2). \n3  26.  The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \n4  provides that \"[n]o state shall ... deprive any person oflife, liberty, or property, without due process of \n5  law ....\"   The United States Supreme Court~ held, under this provision, ..t hat a person charged by a \n6  State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial \n7  cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a \n8  substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.\" Jackson v. Indiana, \nu.s. \n9  406  715,738 (1972). \n10  27.  Similarly, the California Supreme Court has held that our state constitution's due process \n11  clause \"demands that the duration of commitments to state hospitals must bear some reasonable relation \n12  to the purpose which originally justified the commitment.\" In re Davis, 8 Cal. 3d 798, 805 (1973). \n13  28.  Moreover, Article I,§ 15 of the California Constitution provides that \"[t]he defendant in \n14  a criminal cause has the right to a speedy public trial,\" which is prejudiced when a defendant spends a \n15  prolonged period in jail \"unaccompanied by the course of treatment that served as the basis for the trial \n16  court's suspension of proceedings.\" Craft v. Superior Court, 140 Cal. App. 4th 1533, 1543 (2006). \n17  B.  Plaintiffs Have Watched Their Family Members Languish in Detention Awaiting \nCommitment \n18 \n29.  Nancy Leiva is the mother of A. A has intellectual disabilities and has been a client of \n19 \nthe Eastern Los Angeles Regional Center since he was an infant He has been in special education \n20 \nclasses since he was in kindergarten and he receives supplemental security income payments. Because \n21 \nof A's inability to provide for his own personal and financial needs, Ms. Leiva has been appointed to be \n22 \nA's limited conservator. \n23 \n30.  A was arrested and incarcerated in Los Angeles County on September 9, 2011. On \n24 \nDecember 6, 2012, A was found incompetent to stand trial pursuant to Penal Code§ 1370.1, due to what \n25 \nthe court labeled mental retardation. The court ordered that A be committed to DDS under the \n26 \nsupervision of Porterville Developmental Center. Despite this order of commitment, A was forced to \n27 \n28 \n6 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  wait in county jail for eight additional months before he was finally admitted to Porterville on August 8, \nI \n2  2013. \n3  31.  A's public defender and the court made nmnerous inquiries to Porterville as to when A \n4  would be admitted over the course oft his eight months. A's public defender filed a habeas petition on \n5  behalf of A to attempt to remedy A's unlawful.detention. The court issued an Order to Show Cause why \n6  A had not yet been admitted despite the commitment order.  Porterville consistently responded that they \n7  could not admit A because the facility was at capacity and there were numerous others on the waiting \n8  list ahead of A.  Porterville further represented that they could not make any estimate as to when A \n9  would be admitted due to the unpredictability of being able to obtain a vacancy at Porterville. \n10  32.  A's intellectual disabilities made the county jail an especially noxious and hostile place. \n11  A was housed in general population where he was easy prey for the other inmates. The worst of the \n12  abuse occurred while be was waiting to be admitted to Porterville.  A was raped - multiple times - by \n13  another inmate.  A was trawnatized by the assaults, and continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress \n14  disorder.  Even when the jail was made aware of the assaults, they did not provide A with any \n15  emergency psychological therapy to assist him in recovering. \n16  33.  The lengthy period of detention following A's commitment order and the multiple rapes \n17  to which A was subjected also caused great pain and suffering for A's mother.  Ms. Leiva has been the \n18  primary caretaker and advocate for A since his birth.  She plays an especially important role in A's life \n19  due to his life-long intellectual disabilities and need for support. It was anguishing for Ms. Leiva to \n20  witness her son incarcerated in the county jail, an enviromnent she knew he was not equipped to handle. \n21  It was a particularly painful experience for Ms. Leiva to learn that her son had been the victim of \n22  multiple rapes while incarcerated and to know she could not do anything to protect him from these \n23  attacks. \n24  34.  Stephanie Stiavetti is the sister ofN. On August 28,2014, N was arrested for resisting \n25  sheriff's deputies in the performance of their duties under Penal Code § 69.  On September 2, 2014 a \n26  felony complaint was filed against N for this charge. \n27 \n28 \n7 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  35.  On September 22, 2014 N was committed to DSH pursuant to Penal Code § 1370, et seq. \n12  A month after the commitment order, N had still not been admitted to a DSH facility.  On October 20, \nI \n3  2014 the superior court issued an Order to Show Cause Why Sanctions Should Not Be Ordered, and \n4  ordered that the sheriff deliver, and that DSH admit, N within 21 days.  Defendant N was admitted to \n5  Metropolitan State Hospital sometime prior to ~ovember 3, 2014..  N was transferred back from \n6  Metropolitan State Hospital to the Contra Costa County Jail earlier this year, but was sent back to \n7  Metropoli~ State Hospital due to continued incompetency, after yet another delay. \n8  36.  The lengthy and ongoing periods of pretrial detention and the weeks of delay in being \n9  admitted to the DSH system following the commitment order have caused great pain and suffering for \n10  both Nand his family, including Ms. Stiavetti.  N' s mental-health issues make him ill~quipped to \n11  handle the county jail environment He has trouble understanding jail rules and can easily become \n12  confused, depressed and agitated.  This has resulted inN getting in fights with correctional staff and \n13  other inmates at the jail. He was placed in administrative segregation in a solitary cell, on a block of \n14  violent offenders, for lengthy periods of time, where he was allowed out of his cell no more than once \n15  every several days.  Being in solitary conditions in particular caused N's mental health to deteriorate. \n16  The longer N was in limbo the more frustrated, depressed and confused be got about his confmement. \n17  This frustration lead to increased agitation, increased the chances he would be involved in altercations, \n18  and increased the likelihood be would be subject to punitive action on the part of the jail. Both the \n19  solitary conditions of confinement and the prolonged waiting with no certain end in sight amounted to \n20  forms of torture according to Ms. Stiavetti. \n21  37.  N's family bas been deeply affected by this experience.  Ms. Stiavetti and her family \n22  have been stuck in a frustrating holding pattern as N goes through the system, and they have felt unable \n23  to help their loved one. They have experienced great pain as they have watched N deteriorate in jail. It \n24  was particularly frustrating for the family not to have any answers as to when N would be transferred to \n25  the state hospital and to have no explanation for the delay. \n26  38.  Rosalind.Randle is the mother ofL, who was detained in Contra Costa County jail for \n27  approximately 12 months while awaiting transfer to the DDS facility at Porterville. L suffers \n28 \n8 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n, 1  penn~ irreparable brain damage as a result of a childhood accident. His condition cannot be treated \n1  2  with medication. \n3  39.  L was arrested on March 4, 2013. On May 15, 20 I 3 his lawyer raised a doubt as to his \n4  competency to stand trial.  The court found L incompetent to stand trial on June 13, 2013 and requested \n5  a placement recommendation from the Contra Costa Conditional Release Program (\"CONREP\"). \n6  Almost four months later, after receiving CONREP's recommendation, the court finally committed L to \n7  the Porterville Developmental Center in November of2013. \n8  40.  L languished in jail for almost another year after he was committed to Porterville.  L's \n9  mental state deteriorated while he sat in jail. He became depressed and lost touch with reality.  Because \n10  ofhis developmental disability, he was not able to adjust his behavior to fit in with the other defendants \n11  he was jailed with.  He was often involved in fights with other inmates, and several times he was sent to \n12  solitary confmement for multiple days. \n13  41.  L was incapable of understanding why he had not yet been transferred to Porterville.  He \n14  called his mother, Ms. Randle, almost every day to ask her why other inmates were getting on the bus to \n15  Porterville, but he was not.  Ms. Randle could not do anything for her son other than to try to explain to \n16  him that it would be his tum when there was room for him.  L was never admitted to Porterville.  On \n17  October 14, 2014 he was instead placed in an out-patient residential facility. \n18  42.  The lopg delays are not unusual. According to documents provided by DDS, as of \n19  February 9, 2015, there were 366 people who had been committed to DSH but had yet to be admitted. \n20  At least one of these individuals had been waiting for 258 days. Most admissions take longer than sixty \n21  days, and many take more than I 00 days. 'The average time between commitment and admittance for \n22  the previous 25 persons admitted before February 9 was more than 75 days. \n23  43.  According to documents provided by DDS, as of April2, 2015 there were 52 \n24  incompetent defendants on the waiting list to be transferred to a DDS hospital following their \n25  commitment. Three of them had been waiting for more than a year; an additional11 had been waiting \n26  for more than nine months. The average incompetent defendant on this list had been waiting for 204 \n27 \n28 \n9 \nVERIFffiD PETrr!ON FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nare \nt'  days; because defendants  admitted in the same order they are placed on this list. these individuals \n' \n2  will likely be waiting much longer before they are actually admitted.  , \n3  c.  Improper Detention ofMentaDy Dl or Developmentally Disabled Penons Wonens \nTheir Condition \n4 \n44.  California's process for commitment of incompetent defendants is intended to restore \n5 \nthese persons to competence so that they may be tried, whenever that is possible. Incarcerating \n6 \nincompetent defendants in county jails has the opposite result. \n7 \n45.  Incompetent defendants \"are the most costly and difficult to manage in the jail. In their \n8 \nacute state they are often violent, noncompliant, a danger to themselves and seriously disruptive to other \n9 \ninmates and staff.  Typically, they will not voluntarily take prescribed medication, thus are not making \n10 \nprogress towards competency to participate in the criminal proceedings.\" Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. \n11 \nFloor Analyses, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 568 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.).  In fact, \"defendants usually get \n12 \nworse the longer they wait for admission to a Mental Health hospital.\" /d. \n13 \n46.  Our state's largest jail system illustrates this problem. In 1996, the United States \n14 \nDepartment of Justice (\"DOJ\") investigated Los Angeles County jails pursuant to the Civil Rights of \n15 \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997 et seq., and concluded that unconstitutional \n16 \nconditions existed at the Los Angeles County Jail, including a deliberate indifference to inmates' serious \n17 \nmental health needs because among other things, (1) inmates received inadequate treatment, such as \n18 \nlengthy delays bc;fore evaluation, improper diagnosis, and improper administration of medication; \n19 \n(2) there were insufficient resources for the number of inmates who needed mental health care; (3) ''the \n20 \nJail [did] not adequately prevent abuse of mentally ill inmates and [did] not adequately investigate \n21 \nallegations of such abuse when it occur[e d]\"; (4  ) custody staff [were] not properly trained to work with \n22 \ninmates with mental illness; and (5) the jails lacked proper policies and practices for suicide prevention. \n23 \n47.  Many of these problems continue to exist: in 2014, the DOJ issued another letter \n24 \ncontaining its findings on the treatment of inmates with mental illness. Among L.A. County's \n25 \ncontinuing failures were (1) \"inadequate mental health care to prevent prisoners from becoming suicidal, \n26 \nto identify suicidal prisoners, or to prevent prisoners from going into crisis\"; (2) inadequate \"custodial \n27 \nsupervision for prisoners, including those ... who have been identified as having a heightened risk of \n28 \n10 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n'1  suicide\"; and (3) housmg inmates \"in conditions that present, rather than prevent a risk of suicide!' The \nI \n2  DOJ found that \"[l]iving conditions in general are deficient (dimly-1i~ vermin-infested, noisy, \n3  unsanitary, cramped and crowded) .•..\"  \n4  48.  In a 2013 County ofNapa position paper on legislation relating to Napa State Hospi~ \n5  Napa County explains that one of the most severe consequences of housing incompetent defendants in \n6  county jails is the \"decompensation they exhibit when moved to the jail and the deterioration in their \n7  condition-when they are kept in a segregated, non-clinical environment.\" Delay in admission to mental \n8  health facilities not only lUlduly punishes incompetent defendants, but it also decreases the probability \n9  that they will achieve competency to proceed with their cases in a timely manner. \n10  49.  These problems are compolUlded by the practice of incarcerating incompetent defendants \n11  in administrative segregation within county jails. In administrative segregation, incompetent defendants \n12  are housed with the most dangerous offenders and are constantly on \"lockdown.\" In some instances, \n13  incompetent defendants in these conditions are released from their cells for only one hour every few \n14  days, and at irregular hours, sometimes very late at night or early in the morning such that they cannot \n15  call their families or counsel.  Moreover, co\\Ulty jail routines change often and largely are lUlpredictable. \n16  This lUlpredictability imposes special hardships on incompetent defendants who may have much greater \n17  difficulty adapting to new routines and for whom erratic routines can cause confusion and stress. \n18  Incompetent defendants' inability to lUlderstand and follow the rules and routines in jail can lead to \n, \n19  disciplinary infractions and loss of privileges, such as commissary and phone time to call family \n20  members, which further compounds the stress and deterioration of these defendants. \n21  50.  Even minor delays can cause extreme distress and deterioration in the condition of \n22  incompetent defendants. For example, Rodney Bock, a self-employed farmer and father of four \n23  daughters, two of whom are plaintiffs in this action, committed suicide while being housed in the Sutter \n24  ColUlty Jail awaiting transfer to Napa State Hospital.  Mr. Bock was folUld incompetent to stand trial on \n25  April19, 2010 and was detained in the Sutter ColUlty Jail. According to a civil suit his family later \n26  filed, within five days he \"was unstable and unkempt, was talking to himself and to inanimate objects \n27  and was refusing his medication.\" \n28 \n11 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  51.  The staff of the Sutter CoWlty Jail observed Mr. Bock banging himself against his cell \n2  door, yelling about or at people who did not exist, and describing vatious hallucinations. In spite of this \n3  erratic behavior, the staff failed to follow their suicide prevention protocol and instead allowed Mr. \n4  Bock to have items that were proscribed due to his psychiatric condition and failed to conduct hourly \n5  safety checks on Mr. Bock. On April29, 2010 Mr. Bock agai.p violently banged his head against the \n6  wall and then hanged himself.  After Mr. Bock's suicide, the Sutter County Grand Jury investigated the \n7  Sutter County Jail and found deficiencies such as a lack of required training on suicide prevention, non-\n8  compliant medical policies, and inadequate medical staffing. \n9  52.  In addition to exacerbating incompetent defendantS' mental disorders or developmental \n10  disabilities, holding incompetent defendants in county jails also exposes jail personnel to the risk of \n11  physical harm and exposes the inmates to additional criminal penalties by putting incompetent \n12  defendants in the care of jailors who do not have the skills or training to manage the erratic and violent \n13  behavior that incompetent defendants often exhibit. As the 2013 Napa County position paper explains, \n14  \"[s ] tate hospital patients require a very high and specialized level of care that a small local jail should \n15  not reasonably be expected to provide.\" As a result, many incompetent defendants are charged with \n16  additional crimes for fighting with guards while they languish in county jail waiting to be sent to a \n17  mental health facility. \n18  53.  For example, a Solano County defendant, Bret Nye was arrested on December 5, 2008 \n19  for allegedly threatening his ex-wife and making a false bomb threat.  Six days later, while in pretrial \n20  custody in the Solano County Jail, Mr. Nye picked up a new offense: felony battery of a correctional \n21  officer. Mr. Nye's erratic behavior caused his attorney to declare a doubt as to 'his competency to stand \n22  trial on December 17, 2008.  On February 25, 2009 the court ordered Mr. Nye transferred to Napa State \n23  Hospital. Mr. Nye was not timely transferred, and on March 19, 2009 his attorney filed a request for an \n24  order to show cause why Napa State Hospital and the Solano County Sheriff's Department should not be \n25  held in contempt for failing to transport Mr. Nye to Napa State Hospital. The next day, while still \n26  waiting to be transferred pursuant to court order, Mr. Nye was charged with another offense, again for \n27  battery of a correctional officer. \n28 \n12 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n'1  54.  Plaintiffsr counsel have tried to resolve this matter with both the DSH and DDS but have \n' 2  been unable to do so. Although both Departments maintain that they are attempting to reduce these \n3  delays, they have not yet done so and are unwilling to enter into a binding agreement that will assure \n4  that they comply with their constitutional obligations. \n5  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nMOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE I,§ 7l \n6  (ALL PLAINTIFFS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS) \n7  55.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all of the above allegations as though fully set forth \n8  herein. \n9  56.  Article I, Section 7 of the California Constitution prohibits the government from \n10  depriving any person oflife, liberty, or property without due process oflaw. \n11  57.  Defendants' delays in admitting incompetent defendants violate this right, including by \n12  not timely accepting transfer of incompetent defendants from county jails, which causes incompetent \n13  defendants who have been committed solely on account of their incapacity to proceed to trial to be held \n14  for more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial \n15  probability that they will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. \n16  58.  Defendants' practice of not timely accepting transfer of incompetent defendants from \n17  county jails also does not afford adequate time for incompetent defendants to be examined and have \n18  their potential to regain competency evaluated within the 90-day period prescribed under Cal. Penal \n19  Code§§ 1370(bX1) and 1370.1(b)(l). \n20  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nMOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE I,§ 15) \n21  CALL PLAINTIFFS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS) \n22  59.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all oft he above allegations as though fully set forth \n23  herein. \n24  60.  Article I, Section 15 of the California Constitution guarantees every criminal defendant \n25  the right to a speedy trial. \n26  61.  Defendants' delays in admitting defendants who have been found incompetent to stand \n27  trial violate this right. \n28 \n13 \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n'1  62.  Defendants' practice of not timely accepting transfer of incompetent defendants from \n2  county jails is unjustified, and is outweighed by prejudice to the speec:\\y trial rights of incompetent \n3  defendants by causing incompetent defendants to be held in jails for prolonged periods of time, and by \n4  causing incompetent defendants to not receive the course of treatment that serves as the basis for the \n5  suspension of their court proceedings during this prolonged imprisonment. \n6  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n<VIOLATION OF UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, AMENDMENT 14) \n7  CALL PLAINTIFFS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS) \n8  63.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all of the above allegations as though fully set forth \n9  herein. \n10  64.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from depriving any person of life, liberty, \n11  or property without due process oflaw. \n12  65.  Defendants' failure to timely accept transfer of incompetent defendants who have been \n13  ordered transferred from county jails violates this right, including by not timely accepting transfer of \n14  incompetent defendants from county jails, which causes incompetent defendants who have been \n15  committed solely on account of their incapacity to proceed to trial to be held for more than the \n16  reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that they will \n17  attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. \n18  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nTAXPAYER ACTION UNDER CODE CIV.

Rogers and Pamela Ahlin was set \nfor hearing on 04/26/2016 at 10:00 AM in Department 21 before the Honorable Winifred Y. Smith. \nThe Tentative Ruling was published and was contested. \nThe matter was argued and submitted, and good cause appearing therefore, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \nThe Demurrer of defendants Pamela Ahlin, sued in her official capacity as Director of the Department \nof State Hospitals, Santi Rogers, sued in his official capacity as Director of the Department of \nDevelopmental Services, and the State of California (collectively, \"Defendants\") To the Petition For \nWrit of Mandate and Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (\"Complaint\") of plaintiffs \nStephanie Stiavetti, Kellie Bock, Kimberly Bock, Rosalind Randle, Nancy Leiva, American Civil \nLiberties Union of Northern California (\"ACLU-NC\"), and American Civil Liberties Union of Southern \nCalifornia (\"ACLU-SC\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") is ruled on as follows: \nBACKGROUND: \nPlaintiff filed the currently operative Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint in this action on \nJuly 29, 2015 (\"Complaint\") seeking relief on behalf of criminal defendants who have been found \nincompetent to stand trial (\"1ST defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege that these individuals languish in jail for \nmonths even after a court has ordered them committed for competency restoration, usually without \nadequate treatment. (Complaint, paragraphs 1-2). The IS T defendants fall into two categories, those \nwho are found to be mentally incompetent (to whom Penal Code section 1370 applies, \"1370 \ndefendants\"), and those who are found to be mentally incompetent and are developmentally disabled (to \nwhom Penal Code section 1370.1 applies, \"1370.1 defendants\"). The placement of 1370 defendants is \ndone by the Department of State Hospitals (\"DSH\") and the placement of 13 70.1 defendants is done by \nthe Department of Developmental Services (\"DDS\"). \nThe individual plaintiffs, Stephanie Stiavetti, Kellie Bock, Kimberly Bock, Rosalind Randle and Nancy \nLeiva, are family members ofiST defendants, and all but Nancy Leiva allege that they \"pay income and \nother state and local taxes.\" ACLU-NC and ACLU-SC are non-profit organizations and allege that they \nand many of their members are assessed and pay California taxes every year. \nThe Complaint sets forth four causes of action:  1) Violation of California Constitution, Article I, \nsection 7 (Due Process); 2) Violation of California Constitution, Article I, section 15 (Speedy Trial); 3) \nViolation of United States Constitution, Amendment 14 (Due Process); and 4) Taxpayer Action Under \nOrder \n\nCode of Civil Procedure (\"CCP\") section 526a To Prevent Illegal Expenditure of Funds. The prayer is \nfor a declaration that Defendants' delays in admitting 1ST defendants violate the due process clauses of \nboth the state and federal constitutions and the speedy trial clause of the state constitution, a writ of \nmandate and an injunction directing Defendants to admit 1ST defendants within a constitutionally \npermissible time following the order of commitment, and attomeys' fees and costs pursuant to CCP \nsection 1021.5. \nDEMURRER: \nDefendants demur to each cause of action on under CCP section 430.10 (e) [\"does not state facts \nsufficient to constitute a cause of action\"], (f) [\"pleading is uncertain\"] and (d) [\"defect or misjoinder of \nparties\"]. They also assert that because the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for mandamus \nrelief that no mandamus relief can be granted, and that the Complaint is not properly verified. \nThe court notes that certain of Defendants' arguments were withdrawn after court-ordered meet and \nconfer sessions with Plaintiffs, as set forth in Defendants' Supplemental Statement Of Meet And Confer \nRegarding Defendants' Demurrer To Complaint, filed on March 24, 2016. Accordingly, those \narguments will not be discussed. \nSTANDING: \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs have not properly alleged taxpayer standing (Code of Civil Procedure \nsection 526a, \"526a standing\") to pursue any of their causes of action because they have not alleged \npayment oftaxes that are \"assessed,\" such as ad valorem taxes on real or personal property (citing, inter \nalia, Blair v. Pitchess (1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 269 fn.2; and Comelius v. Los Angeles County Met. Trans. \nAuthority (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1775-1779 [\"Comelius\"]). Defendants also argue that ACLU \nNC and ACLU-SC have not properly alleged associational standing under 526a because they only \nvaguely allege that their members pay unspecified \"Califomia taxes.\" \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the alleged payment of income and other state and local taxes is \nadequate, citing cases in which similar allegations went unchallenged (e.g., Cal. Ass'n For Safety Educ. \nv. Brown (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1268 n.1), or where the type of taxes paid by the \npetitioners/plaintiffs were not identified (e.g., Tobe v. City of Santa Ana (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1081, \n1086 [\"Tobe\"]). \nThe only case cited by either party in which the question of whether the payment of state income taxes \nconfers 526a standing was directly addressed is Comelius. While Defendants are correct that the \nComelius court found no 526a standing on the facts before it, the court concludes that Comelius is \ndistinguishable. The Comelius plaintiff sought to challenge an affirmative action program implemented \nby the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (\"MTA\"), a local govemmental \nagency (Comelius, at 1764), and the court's ruling on the taxpayer standing issue \\vas based on an \nanalysis of the MTA's revenue sources, only 15 percent of which came from the state govemment, and \nthe conclusions that the relationship between the taxes paid and the policy being contested was \n\"tangential\" and that initiation of lawsuits against local public agencies based only on the payment of \nstate income taxes would not be sound public policy. (Comelius, at 1777-1779.) Here, Plaintiffs are \nchallenging the actions or inactions of State agencies, and as Plaintiffs correctly point out in their \nopposition, there are no published cases that support the blanket assertion that 526a standing in an \naction against a State agency may only be based on assessment of property taxes. Indeed, other cases \nagainst local govemments or agencies, such as Tobe, support the inference that property ownership is \nnot necessary, as the plaintiffs in that case included homeless persons who were taxpayers (Tobe, at \n1081 and 1086.) \nThe court also rejects Defendants' challenge to the associational standing of ACLU-NC and ACLU-SC. \nWhile it is true that the kind of taxes that the members of these associations is not spelled out in the \nComplaint, Defendants cannot reasonably assert that none of the members ovvn real property, let alone \nthat none of them pay state income taxes. \nAlthough Defendants' 526a standing arguments did not single out any of the individual Plaintiffs, as \nnoted above, there are no taxpayer allegations in the Complaint that apply to Nancy Leiva. Accordingly, \nDefendant's demurrer on the basis oflack of 526a standing is SUSTAINED as to Nancy Leiva and \nOVERRULED as to all other Plaintiffs. Nancy Leiva does not have standing to pursue the 1st, 2nd, 3rd \nOrder \n\nor 4th causes of action. As further addressed, below, however, all of the named plaintiffs, including \nNancy Leiva, have citizen standing to pursue mandamus relief. \nDUE PROCESS (STATE): \nAs to the 1st cause of action, Defendant argues that the habeas process, as codified in the Penal Code \n(\"PC\"), provides due process, and the availability of Order To Show Cause (\"OSC\") proceedings and \npetitions for writs of habeas corpus foreclose Plaintiffs' cause of action for due process under the state \nconstitution. Defendants also assert that plaintiffs Stiavetti and Bock cannot establish a due process \nviolation because Stiavetti's brother was admitted within a reasonable time after commitment and \nBock's father expired within ten days of his commitment order.  · \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the availability of post-deprivation relief in individual cases is \nirrelevant to Plaintiffs' due process claims, which are based on both substantive and procedural due \nprocess. (Citing, inter alia, Or. Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2003).) The court \nagrees. Plaintiff also argues that the separate argument as to Stiavetti and Bock misconstrues Plaintiffs' \nclaims, which are not based on the circumstances specific to these families. Again, the court agrees. \nDefendants' demurrer to the 1st cause of action is OVERRULED. \nSPEEDY TRIAL (STATE): \nAs to the 2nd cause of action, Defendants argue (a) that there is no private right of action to enforce \nanother's right to speedy trial, the enforcement mechanisms protecting the right to a speedy trial may be \nbrought either by the criminal defendant or their appointed counsel, but not by family members; (b) \nbecause the right to a speedy trial is subordinate to the constitutional right to not undergo trial while \nincompetent, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs cannot claim any denial of the right to speedy trial by alleged \ndelays in admitting 1ST defendants to DSH or DDS for competency training (citing, inter alia, People v. \nMcGill (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 759, 761); and (c) the Complaint is silent regarding any effort by the \n1ST defendants or their counsel to assert their right to a speedy trial, so they may have waived their \nrights or otherwise consented to delays. \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that their claims are consistent with those in Craft v. Sup. Ct. (2006) 140 \nCal.App.4th 1533 (\"Craft\"), and are consistent with the general and established rule that a taxpayer \nplaintiff may bring  a cause of action to challenge unlawful expenditure of public funds in violation of \nthe state and federal constitutions, even when individual relief is available to incarcerated defendants \n(citing VanAtta v. Scott (1980) 27 Cal.3d 424, 447-448 [\"VanAtta\"].) The court agrees. \nDefendants' demurrer to the 2nd cause of action is OVERRULED. \nDUE PROCESS (FEDERAL): \nAs to the 3rd cause of action, Defendants argue that there is no cause of action directly under the United \nStates Constitution. Rather, relief must be sought under 42 U.S. C. section 1983 (citing Azul-Pacifico \nInc. v. City of Los Angeles, 973 F.2d 704, 705). This argument was apparently based on Defendants' \nassumption that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims, both state and federal, were for procedural due process \nonly. Plaintiffs' opposition arguments are directed to the challenges to both the 1st and the 3rd causes of \naction, and are well taken. Plaintiffs do not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. section1983, nor are they \nrequired to do so. (Mission Hosp. Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Shewry (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 460, 479-480.) \nDefendants' demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is OVERRULED. \nILLEGAL SPENDING: \nAs to the 4th cause of action, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged specific facts of illegal \nspending (citing, inter alia, Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. v. County of Alameda (2000) \n79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1240), and that a taxpayer claim cannot be brought based on state officials' \ndiscretionary acts (citing, inter alia, Califomia Assn. for Safety Education v. Brown (1994) 30 \nCal.App.4th 1264, 1281.) \nDefendants' discretionary acts argument is supported by a discussion of the applicable statutory \nOrder \n\nprovisions. The statutory scheme for 1ST defendants with mental disorders (PC 1370) does not include \nquantitative time frames for admission to DSH, but does require a progress report within 90 days of the \ncommitment order (PC 1370(b)(l)), and the court in In re Mille, on Habeas Corpus (2010) 182 \nCal.App.4th 635, 650, applying constitutional principles, held that when a court orders an 1ST \ndefendant committed to a state hospital the actual transfer must happen \"within a reasonable period of \ntime.\" Defendants also point out that amendments to PC 1370 in 2012 and 2014 established that \ntreatment facilities are not limited to DSH, but may include a county jail or a community-based \nresidential treatment facility, and the 2014 amendments also shifted control over the admission ofiST \ndefendants from the conunitting court to DSH and increased DSH's statutory discretion. \nAs to the 1370.1 defendants, Defendants assert that DDS is not the only placement option. They may be \ncommitted to a state hospital, a developmental center, or other approved residential facility, or may be \nplaced on outpatient status. (PC 1370.1(a)(1)(B)(i).) That is to say, DDS does not have sole \nresponsibility to provide training and evaluation under PC 13 70 . 1. Defendants further assert that when \na 1370.1 defendant is committed to DDS, the DDS facility at Porterville Development Center is subject \nto a statutory population cap, and DDS has the discretion to reject placements at Porterville on the basis \nof security issues and other patient health factors. Like PC 1370, PC 1370.1 does not state a \nquantitative timeframe for DDS to admit an 1ST defendant following a commitment order, although PC \n13 70.1 does not have a 90 day progress report requirement. \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the Complaint includes ample allegations that Defendants have \nengaged in systematic constitutional violations, and their statutory discretion is subordinate to their \nconstitutional duty, which is not discretionary. (Kilgore v. Younger (1982) 30 Cal.3d 770, 790.) \nPlaintiff further argues that 526a relief is available independent of any other alleged avenues of relief. \n(VanAtta, at 447.) The court agrees. The factual allegations in the Complaint are sufficient, for \npleading purposes. \nDefendants' demurrer to the 4th cause of action is OVERRULED. \nSTATE AS DEFENDANT: \nDefendants argue that the State of California is not a proper defendant for any of Plaintiffs' claims, \nbecause they cannot obtain mandamus, injunctive or declaratory relief, or bring a taxpayer claim, \nagainst the State of California, as distinct from an agency or officer (citing State v. Sup. Ct. (1974) 12 \nCal.3d 237, 255). \nPlaintiffs' only argument in opposition is that there is no blanket rule that wTit or injunctive relief may \nnot be obtained as to the State of California. This argument misses the point, which is that any form of \nrelief in this case would be directed to the DHS and the DDS, and Plaintiffs acknowledge that if the \nState's demurrer is sustained as to the petition for writ of mandate, it would have no effect on the writ as \nto the other Defendants. (Opposition, page 26, fn.14.) \nSince there is no apparent basis for Plaintiffs' claims as against the State of California, the State of \nCalifornia's demurrer to the entire Complaint is SUSTAINED, and the State of California is \nDISMISSED. \nMANDAMUS: \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs' mandamus claim must fail because they have not separately stated a \nmandamus cause of action as required by California Rule of Court (\"CRC\") 2.112, and because the \nelements of a mandamus cause of action have not been pled. These arguments have no merit. There is \nno authority for the proposition that mandamus, which is a form of relief, must be set forth in a separate \ncause of action, the constitutional rights of the 1ST defendants are enforceable by writ of mandate, and \nthe fact that Defendants exercise some discretion in implementing mandatory constitutional duties does \nnot foreclose the availability of mandamus relief. \nIt is not clear to the court whether Defendants intended to withdraw their \"clear, present and beneficial \nright\" standing argument as applied to the writ of mandate. If not, the court rejects this argument on the \nmerits. The allegations of the Complaint are sufficient to establish \"citizen standing.\" (Green v. Obledo \n(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 144.) \nOrder \n\nDefendants' demurrer to the Writ of Mandate is OVERRULED. \nCLAIM SPLITTING: \nFinally, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs Kellie and Kimberly Bock have improperly split their claims, \nas they both brought suit in federal court in 2011 alleging the failure to timely transfer their father from \ncounty jail to DSH caused his death. Also, in that suit, the Bocks averred that DSH authorized \nadmission of their father yet the County defendants failed to deliver him, which is inconsistent with the \nallegations in this case. This argument misconstrues Plaintiffs' claims, which are not based on the \ncircumstances specific to these families. \nTo the extent Defendants' demurrer is based on this argument, it is OVERRULED. \nRULING: \nThe State of California is DISMISSED as a defendant. \nDefendants Ahlin and Rogers shall answer the Complaint forthwith, and no later than May 6, 2016. \nDefendants' Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the subject records only. \nDated:  04/26/2016 \nJudge Winifred Y.

Smith. \nThe Tentative Ruling was published and was contested. \nThe matter was argued and submitted, and good cause appearing therefore, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \nThe Motion of defendants Pamela Ahlin, sued in her official capacity as Director of the Department of \nState Hospitals (\"DSH\"), Santi Rogers, sued in his official capacity as Director of the Department of \nDevelopmental Services (\"DDS\"), and the State of California (collectively, \"Defendants\") To Strike \nPortions of the Petition For Writ of Mandate and Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n(\"Complaint\") of plaintiffs Stephanie Stiavetti, Kellie Bock, Rosalind Randle, Nancy Leiva, American \nCivil Liberties Union of Northern California (\"ACLU-NC\"), and American Civil Liberties Union of \nSouthern California (\"ACLU-SC\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") (\"Motion\") is ruled on as follows: \nThis Motion was heard concurrently with Defendants' Demurrer, which will be the subject of a separate \norder. All relevant portions of that order are incorporated herein by this reference. \nREQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE: \nDefendants' request for judicial notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the subject records only. \nMOTION: \nDefendants seek to strike three categories of allegations from the Complaint on the basis that they are \nirrelevant to Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants: 1) allegations concerning the conditions of \nconfinement at county jails, including but not limited to Los Angeles County Jail, Contra Costa County \nJail, Sutter County Jail, and Solano County Jail: 2) allegations that decedent Rodney Bock was not \ntimely admitted by DSH; and 3) allegations that Brett Nye was not timely admitted by DSH. Defendant \nalso asserts that some of these allegations are time barred. \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that all of these allegations support the basic premise of the alleged \nconstitutional violations, that confinement in county jails worsens the mental state ofiST defendants \nand places them in danger. (Complaint, paragraph 2.) The court agrees. The allegations in these three \ncategories do not fall within the scope of Code of Civil Procedure section (\"CCP\") 436(a). The Motion \nis DENIED as to these allegations. \nOrder \n\nDefendants also seek to strike the prayer for mandamus relief. For the reasons stated in the companion \norder on Defendants' Demurrer, the Motion is DENIED as to the prayer for mandamus relief. \nDefendants also seeks to strike allegations that ACLU-NC and ACLU-SC pay California taxes. \nPlaintiffs have conceded this point in their opposition. Accordingly the Motion is GRANTED as to \nallegations of direct payment by ACLU-NC and ACLU-SC of taxes. However, as indicated in the \ncompanion order of Defendants' Demurrer, associational standing on the basis ofthe payment of taxes \nby members is adequately pled. \nFinally, Defendants assert that the entire Complaint should be stricken on the basis that it is not \nproperly verified. Their primary argument in support of this assertion is that the person who executed \nthe verification is an attorney, and she did not set forth in the verification the reasons why the \nverification was not done by a party. This argument has no merit. As Plaintiffs argued in their \nopposition, Christine P. Sun signed the verification in her officer capacity as Associate Director and \nDirector ofthe Legal Policy Department of the ACLU-NC. The court also rejects Defendants' further \nassert that the verification is inadequate because it is made \"on information and belief.\" The court finds \nthat while the verified Complaint may be subject to hearsay objections if relied upon as evidence, the \nverification on information and belief, which falls within the scope of CCP section 446, is sufficient, for \npleading purposes. The extent it seeks to strike the entire Complaint on the basis of insufficient \nverification, the Motion is DENIED. \nFacs1ffiiie \n~ \nDated:  04/26/20 16 \nJudge Winifred Y.

After \n1\n9  consideration of the briefing and the argument, IT IS ORDERED: The motion of CDSH to stay \n20 \ndiscovery is DENIED. \n21 \n22 \nSTANDARD \n23 \n24  The Court may stay a case in its entirety in the interest of justice.  (C.C.P. 187; Jordache \n25  Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 18 Ca1.4th 739, 758 [\"The case \n26 \n1 \n\n. \n'· \n1  management tools available to trial courts [includes] the inherent authority to stay an action \n2  when appropriate\"]; Bailey v.

The court exercises its discretion in deciding whether to \n7  stay discovery based on the individual circumstances of each case and the reasons that suggest \n8  the grant or denial of a request for a stay.  (Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 \n9  Cal.App.4th 876, 886 [trial court exercises discretion in determining whether to stay civil case \n10  while criminal case is pending].) \n11  The party seeking the protective order to stay discovery has the burden of showing good \n12  cause for the order sought.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Ca1.4th 245, 255; \n13·  Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 318.) \n14 \nANALYSIS \n15 \nPlaintiffs bring this action asserting that the CDSH is violating the constitutional rights of \n16 \n17  incompetent defendants by subjecting them to long waits after they are declared incompetent and \n18  before they are admitted to state hospitals.  Plaintiffs assert four causes of action (1) due process \n19 \nviolations under the California Constitution, (2) violation of the California constitutional right to \n20 \na speedy trial, (3)  due process violations under the United States Constitution, ~nd (4) a taxpayer \n21 \nclaim under CCP 526A based on the prior three claims. \n22 \nBefore the litigation commenced, Plaintiffs made a request for public records under the \n23. \nCalifornia Public Records Act.  (Gov. Code 6260, et seq. [the \"CPRA\"].)  The CDSH provided \n24 \nover 400 pages of documents.  After filing the lawsuit, Plaintiffs served CDSH with \n25 \n26 \n2 \n\ninterrogatories and document requests.  (Tillman Dec., para 3-4.)  It is unclear to what degree \n1 \nthere is an overlap between the public records produced under the CPRA and the documents and \n2 \ninformation requested in the civil discovery. \n3 \n4  The COSH seeks a stay of all discovery on the grounds that (1) Defendants have filed a \n5  demurrer and motion to strike asserting that Plaintiffs lack standing and the complaint is not \n6 \nviable and (2) there are four related cases that present the same legal issues concerning the \n7 \ntimeframe under Penal Code 13 70 for the admission of criminal defendants declared incompeten \n8 \nto stand trial to the Department of State Hospitals.  (Notice of related cases filed 10/1115.) \n9 \nThe court will not stay all discovery simply because a party has filed a demurrer or \n10 \nmotion to strike.  California law permits discovery to proceed while the pleadings develop. \n11 \n(CCP 2025.210(b); 2030.020(b); 2031.020(b); Budget Finance Plan v. Superior Court (1973) 34 \n12 \n13  Cal.App.3d 794, 797-798.)  Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery to develop their claims.  (Union \n14  Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 1, 12.  CDSH argues that Terminals \n15 \nEquipment Co. v. City and County ofS an Francisco (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d ·234, 24 7, stands for \n16 \nthe proposition that a court should stay discovery if a plaintiff has not filed a viable complaint \n17 \nstating at least one triable cause of action.  Terminals stands for the more modest propositions \n18 \nthat the court has the discretion to stay discovery and that on the facts of that case the trial court \n19 \ndid not abuse its discretion in staying discovery. \n20 \nOn the specific facts of this case, the demurrer and motion to strike were filed on 10/1115 \n21 \n22  and by stipulation of the parties the opposition is not due until 11/13/15.  (Stipulation and order \n23 \nof 9/18/15.)  The court is not inclined to prejudge the merits of the demurrer and motion to strike \n24 \nbelore Plaintiffs have filed their brief. \n25 \n26 \n3 \n\nThe court will not stay all discovery simply because a party has filed a prior or \n1 \ncontemporaneous request for some of the requested documents under the California Public \n2 \nRecords Act.  (Gov. Code 6260, et seq. [the \"CPRA\"].)  The CPRA concerns the public's access \n3 \n4  to government documents that concern the people's business whereas the Discovery Act \n5  concerns a litigant's access to information relevant to the claims and defenses in a lawsuit.  A \n6 \nlitigant's ability to obtain discovery in a lawsuit does not limit or in any way diminish the \n7 \nlitigant's rights as a member of the public to access public records under the. CPRA.  (County of \n8 \nLos Angeles v. Superior Court (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 57, 63.)  Similarly, a litigant's \n9 \npossession of public records obtained through the CPRA do not automatically relieve the \n10 \nproducing party of the burden of responding to requests for the production of documents and \n11 \nproducing the same documents in civil litigation. The pertinent difference in the two situations is \n12 \n13  that the court can on a motion for a protective order consider a party's possession of public \n14 \nrecords obtained through the CPRA in determining whether the state entity must bear the burden \n15 \nof producing the same documents in civil discovery.  (CCP 2019.030(a)(l) [court can limit \n16 \ndiscovery if the discovery sought is \"unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable \n17 \nfrom some other source\"].)  This would, however, be a fact specific determination. \n18 \nThe court will not stay discovery simply because the case might be resolved by decisions \n19 \nof the Court of Appeal in other cases.  As a general proposition, the court is not inclined to stay a \n20 \ncase or to stay discovery at the trial level because a central issue might be resolved by a Court of \n21 \n22  Appeal decision.  There are many unresolved legal issues and even more individualized factual \n23  scenarios.  In addition, the case on appeal might settle or the Court of Appeal might decide the \n24 \ncase on a narrow ground and leave a legal issue in question unresolved.  The court will not delay \n25 \nthe resolution of matters before the trial court based on the possibility that at some indeterminate \n26 \n4 \n\ntime the Court of Appeal might address and resolve a legal issue that might be pertinent to this \n1 \ncase.  That said, if the Court of Appeal issues a published decision that one side or. the other \n2 \nthinks will resolve some or all of the claims in this case, then they may bring a motion for \n3 \n4  judgment on the pleadings or another motion addressing the merits of the case. \n5 \n6 \nORDER. \n7 \nThe motion of CDSH to stay discovery is DENIED. The CDSH has not demonstrate \n8 \nthat it is appropriate to stay all discovery in this case.  The CDSH did not identify the discover \n9 \nsought to be stayed, did not demonstrate that the case has so little ·legal merit that the court will \n10 \nlikely  sustain  the  pending  demurrer  without  leave  to  amend,  did  not  demonstrate  that th \n11 \ndiscovery sought was  \"unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,  or [had been obtained]  from \n12 \n13  some other source\"  (CCP 2019.030(a)(l)), and did not demonstrate that that the legal issues i \n14  this case will be resolved in the cases now pending in the Court of Appeal. \n15 \nThe court suggests, but does not order, that the parties meet and confer to discuss options \n16 \nregarding the scope and nature of reasonable discovery appropriate to this ca~e.  This includes, \n17 \nbut is not limited to, the following: \n18 \n1.  Discussing whether to enter into a stipulated protective order that will preserve the \n19 \nprivacy interests of third parties. \n20 \n2.  Discussing whether the CDSH could produce in this case the documents that the \n21 \nCDSH previously produced in the other cases.  The documents are presumably \n22 \nrelevant the claims in this case because the CDSH argued that the court should stay \n23 \nthis case because the central issues would be resolved in the other cases.  There is \n24 \npresumably minimal burden on the CDSH because the CDSH has presumably \n25 \nidentified, collected, scanned, and numbered the documents in the other cases. \n26 \n5 \n\n1  3.  Discussing whether the CDSH has relevant, readily identifiable, and readily \n2  accessible data that has not been produced in the other cases. \n3  4.  Discussing whether the CDSH has relevant data that is not both readily identifiable \n4  and readily accessible data, and for which production might be contingent on cost \n5  shifting.  (CCP 2031.280( e); Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. v. \n6  Superior Court (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 762, 769-772.)  The CDSH could then offer \n7  plaintiffs estimates of how much money it would cost to obtain various types or \n8  categories of data. \n9  5.
