For the reasons stated on the record, the Motion for Order Requiring Marion County Sheriff to Transport Patients 359 is DENIED with leave to renew. The Unopposed Motion to Amend the September 1, 2022 Order 367 is TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT. As discussed on the record, the interested parties are ORDERED to meet and confer and provide a proposed amended order by April 7, 2023. The proposed amended order should include who is obligated to perform what actions after patients are released from OSH, and under what authority. In light of the arguments on the record, further briefing discussing (1) what obligation OSH has to meet judges requests for pre-discharge progress reports and (2) whether the least intrusive means requirement obliges parties to seek state court relief for state court orders before turning to federal court is simultaneously due from the interested parties on April 25, 2023.

The report indicates that there are occasionally delays in admission that are caused by circumstances outside defendants' control, such as where the Oregon State Hospital (\"OSH\") offers a bed to a county jail for an individual being held there but the jail declines to transport that individual. Defendants are directed to provide a supplemental report to the Court that details the process related to these individuals by close of business Wednesday, June 18, 2025. The supplemental report should, at minimum, address the following questions: When a bed is offered to and declined by a county jail, what happens to the individual who would have been taken to OSH if not for the jail's declination to transport? In other words, is that individual offered the next available bed, moved to the bottom of the list, or something else? And, if the same circumstances occur such that an individual remains housed at OSH longer than is deemed necessary by OSH, what is the mechanism to return that individual back to the appropriate county's jail?

    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon on March 19, 2002, by the Oregon Advocacy Center (&ldquo;OAC&rdquo;), representing criminal patients unable to stand trial due to mental illness; the Metropolitan Public Defender Services, Inc. (&ldquo;MPD&rdquo;); and a criminal patient who waited 23 days after being found unfit to stand trial before admittance to a proper mental health treatment facility. The plaintiffs sued the Oregon Department of Human Services (&ldquo;DHS&rdquo;) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (&ldquo;PAIMI&rdquo;) Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 10805. The plaintiffs were represented by Disabilities Rights Oregon, the Protection &amp; Advocacy organization for the state of Oregon. The complaint for this case is not available in electronic form, but according to the Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusion of Law by District Court Judge Owen M. Panner, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and permanent injunctive relief along with attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. 2002 WL 35578910 (D. Or. 2002).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated Oregon criminal patients&rsquo; Due Process constitutional rights by failing to promptly transfer these individuals to an appropriate state mental health hospital, leaving them in various county jails without proper treatment. On March 25, 2002, Oregon State Hospital (&ldquo;OSH&rdquo;) had a list of 11 criminal patients unable to stand trial, who were awaiting transport to a facility. Plaintiffs claim that the county jails in which these criminal patients were residing while awaiting transfer were unequipped to handle these types of patients. They claimed that these jails were &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;, &ldquo;lack[ed] people who [were] trained to care for mentally ill people&rdquo;, while one in particular was described as having &ldquo;virtually no mental health treatment&rdquo; at all. According to the plaintiffs, the wait time for these individuals was unacceptable, and the criminal patient population had a high suicide risk and that psychosis can be an emergency requiring immediate treatment; therefore, prompt transfer to a proper mental health facility that can help deal with these situations would be critical. 2002 WL 35578910 (D. Or. 2002).</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2002, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. This motion was denied by Judge Panner on March 25, 2002. On March 29, 2002, the defendants filed a motion for protective order, but it was denied by Judge Panner on the same day.</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2002, Judge Panner entered a Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusion of Law. 2002 WL 35578910 (D. Or. 2002). The district court found all individuals have a right to be free from incarceration, absent a criminal conviction. Specifically, the court found that it was the state&rsquo;s interest to assist restoring competency to criminal patients, not to punish them. The court stated that while Oregon county jails did not have the capacity to provide adequate mental health treatment tailored to rehabilitate or restore competency, OSH does. The court recognized that persons found unable to stand trial, yet remain incarcerated, were entitled to prompt treatment in a rehabilitative facility, as even short periods of incarceration could cause extreme harm. The court held that the defendants violated the due process rights of the criminal patients unfit to stand trial. Accordingly, the court ordered that all admissions of these individuals to a state hospital be done in a reasonably timely manner no more than seven days after an order determining a criminal defendant to be unable to stand trial due to mental incapacities. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the order. 2002 WL 35578910 (D. Or. 2002).</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2002, the defendants filed a notice of appeal from the Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusion of Law and filed a motion to stay judgment pending appeal. The next day Judge Panner entered a judgment for the plaintiffs, while also retaining jurisdiction to enforce the injunction. 2002 WL 35578888 (D. Or. 2002). On May 27, 2002, Judge Panner denied the defendants&rsquo; May 14 motion to stay, concluding that the defendants failed to show a strong showing that their appeal was likely to succeed. Judge Panner was eventually proven correct on this conclusion, as on March 6, 2003, Ninth Circuit of The United States Court of Appeals affirmed District Court Judge Panner&rsquo;s judgment in an opinion by Circuit Judge Raymond C. Fisher. 322 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2003). The Court of Appeals concluded that OAC had standing to bring the suit, and upheld the district court&rsquo;s injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees on May 15, 2002, which Judge Panner granted on May 29 of that same year. The plaintiffs were awarded $53,062.50 in attorneys&rsquo; fees and $600.86 in costs. On July 30, 2003, the 9th Circuit Court awarded plaintiffs an additional $31,252.50 in attorneys&rsquo; fees to cover the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On May 19, 2019, litigation suddenly resumed. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a finding of contempt because the defendants admitted, in sworn testimony, that they had been violating the injunction since October 2018. Rather than transporting patients to OSH within seven days, the defendants, MPD attorneys reported, had taken approximately one month to transport recent clients. The case was reassigned from Judge Owen M. Panner to Judge Michael W. Mosman because Judge Panner passed away in 2018. On June 12, 2019, Judge Mosman denied the motion for a finding of contempt but scheduled a compliance hearing. The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, but the appeal was dismissed voluntarily on September 5, 2019. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 23, 2019, the plaintiffs requested modification of the injunction and a declaratory judgment that they were the prevailing party&ndash;&ndash;for the purposes of attorneys&rsquo; fees&ndash;&ndash;because the defendants resumed compliance with the injunction following the motion for contempt. On October 28, 2019, Judge Mosman denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for declaratory judgment, reasoning that, since the injunction did not provide for monitoring, the monitoring work done by DRO and MPD was not compensable. Additionally, Judge Mosman concluded that there was not sufficient proof that plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for contempt spurred the defendant to return to compliance because OSH had been sporadically complying with the injunction between 2018 and 2019 and had been working on its compliance issues before the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion. Judge Mosman also declined to modify the injunction to require monitoring by the plaintiff because defendants&rsquo; noncompliance was not a &ldquo;significant change,&rdquo; and there was no evidence that the new legislation creating a diversion program had slowed down admission at OSH. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to modify the injunction because OSH could not safely comply with the injunction due to COVID-19. The defendants requested to temporarily limit admissions until &ldquo;it is medically safe for OSH to begin accepting patients in the normal course again&rdquo; and be able to admit small groups of patients onto specialized admissions units with the ability to quarantine new admissions. On May 13, 2020, Judge Mosman granted defendants&rsquo; proposed modification of the injunction. The defendant was required to submit progress reports to the court and the plaintiffs with updates on progress towards eliminating the backlog of patients and not have a quarantine period longer than 14 days. On June 12, 2020, plaintiffs appealed the modification of the injunction to the Ninth Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants submitted regular progress reports per the modification of the injunction. On December 1, 2020, the defendants made an emergency request to suspend admission temporarily due to COVID-19. The court granted the order to suspend admission on December 2, 2020, and continued the grant extensions to the suspension until May 31, 2021. On May 17, 2021, Judge Mosman directed the parties to engage in a settlement conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2021, the Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded the district court&rsquo;s modification of the injunction in an unpublished decision. The Ninth Circuit held that the lower court abused its discretion by not tailoring its order to the factual circumstances because it modified the mandatory seven-day deadline without &ldquo;imposing meaningful parameters to ensure that the interests of those patients are served to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The district court could have instead adopted a sunset date for the new admissions period or proposed a timeline other than seven days. Even though the lower court was facing the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic, the Ninth Circuit concluded that an open-ended modification of the injunction was &ldquo;inconsistent with the urgent need to transfer individuals&hellip;out of jails.&rdquo; 2021 WL 3615536. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In light of the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision, the plaintiffs filed for a permanent injunction in the district court on August 18, 2021. On September 22, 2021, Judge Mosman denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a permanent injunction and instead modified the injunction. Judge Mosman ordered the defendants to submit progress reports to the court and the plaintiffs every three weeks with the admissions records and wait times for plaintiffs and submit weekly reports to plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel with the admission list, a list of patients referred for admission, and whether OSH anticipated pausing admissions in the next two weeks. The order was set to expire December 3, 2021. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, 2021, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s 2019 denial of attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs were awarded the amount calculated in their motion minus the amount billed for settlement talks, which equaled $43,545.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 10, 2021, the parties came to an interim agreement to appoint a neutral expert, Dr. Debra Pinals, and to consolidate this case with Bowman v. Matteucci (3:21-cv-01637), which was a case about mental health admissions. The purpose of the expert was to propose a short-term compliance plan and a global admissions protocol. Dr. Pinals submitted reports on January 30 and June 5, 2022. In those reports, Dr. Pinals recommended three actions to fix the admittance crisis at OSH. First, that the plaintiffs seek to limit patients who can be admitted to OSH to only those who need expedited admission. Second, that the plaintiffs ask for a decreased period of commitment at OSH on a sliding scale of 90 days to one year based on the seriousness of the crime that the patient was charged with. Third, that OSH must discharge the approximately 100 patients who had been committed for longer than the new maximum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2022, Judge Mosman granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs&rsquo; request to implement Dr. Pinals&rsquo;s recommendations. Judge Mosman granted plaintiffs&rsquo; request to implement Dr. Pinals&rsquo;s report more broadly, but he denied the implementation of the specific solutions discussed above because they violated state law. This was because all civilly committed patients, not just those on expedited requests, had a right to be admitted to OSH and the commitment could last up to three years.</p>\r\n<p>On September 1, 2022, Judge Mosman modified the court&rsquo;s adoption of the neutral expert&rsquo;s report. Judge Mosman found that defendants were not in compliance with the permanent injunction, and ordered the defendants to comply with the full recommendations in Dr. Pinals&rsquo;s report. If not terminated by the neutral expert, the injunction is currently scheduled to expire September 1, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2022, Legacy Emanuel Hospital &amp; Health Center, Providence Health &amp; Services - Oregon, Legacy Health Systems, and PeaceHealth filed a motion to intervene, which was granted on October 13, 2022. Judge Mosman also further consolidated the case with Legacy Health System et al v. Allen (6:22-cv-01460-MO), which was a case about whether forcing acute care hospitals to civilly commit patients that OSH had a statutory duty to admit violated the patients&rsquo; Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The intervenors filed a motion to modify or dissolve the injunction by arguing for a less intrusive alternative. On January 9, 2023, Judge Mosman denied the intervenors&rsquo; motion to modify or dissolve the injunction. First, the intervenors argued that the court should wait for the backlog caused by the pandemic to work its way through the system, but the court held that the admissions pauses took place too long ago and should have cleared the system, so the state needed the shorter discharge times. Second, the intervenors argued for increasing capacity by opening another facility, contracting with private providers, and increasing staff, but the court held that OSH had already taken many of these measures and it would be intrusive on the state&rsquo;s policy making powers. Third, the intervenors proposed to tweak OSH&rsquo;s admissions and discharge policies, but these changes were all addressed by the neutral expert. The intervenors also argued that returning patients to their communities too early would cause them to decompensate, which would directly affect the intervenors because they would have to admit the patients for civil commitments and it would cause additional constitutional violations. The intervenors wanted to change expedited admissions criteria for civil commitments and discharge criteria, but Judge Mosman held that the neutral expert&rsquo;s recommendations had remedied these concerns. Overall, since the state acquiesced to the neutral expert by acknowledging that they could not solve the crisis, the court upheld the injunction to defer to OSH&rsquo;s policy decision to change its policies in line with the neutral report, instead of forcing OSH to defer to the intervenors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and litigation is ongoing on that motion.</p>",

Plaintiffs, Defendants, Amici Judges, and Amici Counties submitted \nadditional briefing.  On November 21, 2022, I held a hearing on the motion at which Intervenors, \nAmici Judges, Amici Counties, Amici District Attorneys, Plaintiffs, and Defendants presented \ntheir arguments.  After clarifying several aspects of the September 1 Order on the record, I TOOK \nUNDER ADVISEMENT Intervenors' Motion.  For the reasons below, I DENY Intervenors' \nmotion with leave to renew. \nBACKGROUND \nThis litigation began over two decades ago.  Defendants who were declared unable to aid \nand assist (\"A&A\") in their own defense were being held in jail for lengthy periods of time, despite \norders to transfer them to Oregon State Hospital (\"OSH\").  For such persons, being in jail rather \nthan at OSH was a humanitarian crisis.  In May 2002, Judge Owen M. Parmer found that the \ncontinued to jailing of such persons violates those defendants'  due process rights under the \nConstitution's Fourteenth Amendment.  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law [ECF 47].  He \nissued an injunction (the \"2002 Injunction\") requiring Oregon to admit these persons into OSH or \nanother treatment facility within seven days of their being declared unfit.  J. [ECF 51]. \nIn 2019, Plaintiffs moved for Defendants to be found in contempt for violating the 2002 \nInjunction.  They alleged that from at least October 2018, Defendants have not been in compliance \nwith the seven-day requirement.  Mot. for Order to Show Cause [ECF 91].  Litigation progressed \nthrough multiple hearings, conferences, appeals, and attempts at settlement.  In the meantime, \n1 All ECF references are to the lead case, 3:02-cv-00339-MO, unless otherwise noted. \n2 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 3 of 15\npersons found \"guilty except for insanity\" (\"GEI\") filed a parallel action in this court.  Similar to \nplaintiffs in the original matter, they alleged that the state held them for months in jail despite \norders from Oregon Circuit Court Judges to commit them OSH.  See Compl., Bowman et al.  v. \nMatteucci et al., 3:21-cv-01637-MO [ECF 1]. \nNearly a year ago, Plaintiffs and Defendants came to an agreement.  They jointly moved \nto  consolidate both cases  and appoint Dr.  Debra Pinals as  a neutral  expert in both matters. \nStipulated Mot. to Appoint Neutral Expert [ECF 238].  Dr. Pinals is a scholar and practitioner in \nthe field of public mental health services and the criminal justice system.  The Parties agreed to \nhave Dr. Pinals provide recommendations to address OSH's capacity issues and create a plan for \nboth long- and short-term compliance with the 2002 Injunction for GEI and A&A patients.  I \ngranted the Parties' motion.  Order Consolidating Cases and Appointing a Neutral Expert [ECF \n240].  From December 2021  onward, the Parties have worked with Dr.  Pinals to meet with \nstakeholders, analyze data, and craft a set of changes to achieve compliance.  Dr. Pinals provided \nreports in January and June to track progress. \nIn  August  2022,  the  Parties  jointly  moved  for  an  order  to  implement  Dr.  Pinals' \nrecommendations \"without delay.\" Order to Implement Neutral Expert's Recommendations [ECF \n252].  They expedited their request because several Oregon Circuit Court Judges sought to hold \none  of the Defendants,  Oregon Health Authority (\"OHA\"),  in contempt for  failing to  admit \nindividuals to OSH.  According to Plaintiffs, one judge even threatened to jail an OHA official as \na sanction.  Id.  at  10.  In light of this situation, I held an expedited hearing.  See Mins.  of \nProceedings [ECF 255].  I granted in part the Parties' proposed order, but only to the extent it did \nnot require contravening state law.  Op. and Order [ECF 256] (the \"August 16 Order\").  I also \n3 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 4 of 15\nenjoined any contempt proceedings that interfered with Defendants' attempts to comply with the \n2002 Injunction.  Id. \nAfter the August 16 Order, the Parties provided supplemental briefing in support of a full \nadoption of the neutral expert's recommendations.  Amici Counties and Amici District Attorneys \njoined the action, arguing against fully adopting the recommendations and seeking to dissolve the \nAugust 16 Order.  After another hearing with Parties and Amici, I granted in full Plaintiffs' and \nDefendants' joint motion and ordered implementation of the neutral expert's recommendations, \nincluding recommendations that arguably override state law. See Mins. of Proceedings [ECF 269]; \nSeptember 1 Order. \nAmici Judges and Intervenors then joined this action.  Like Amici Counties and Amici \nDistrict Attorneys, they argued against implementing the neutral expert's recommendations and \nsought to dissolve the August 16 and September 1 Orders.  Intervenors filed the motion before me \nand simultaneously brought a separate lawsuit.  See Compl., No.  6:22-cv-01460-MO, Legacy \nHealth System et al. v. Allen [ECF 1].  In both their motion and their lawsuit, they allege various \nconstitutional violations committed by the state of Oregon against their civilly committed patients \nand themselves.  They allege these violations stem from OHA's failure to ensure meaningful \ntreatment for these patients in terms of adequate access to OSH. \nI held a hearing on the August 16 Order on October 25, 2022, and dissolved that order in \nits entirety.  Mins. of Proceedings [ECF 306].  I also consolidated the Intervenors' new case with \nthe existing two. After further briefing from parties, I held oral argument on the motion to dissolve \nor modify the September 1 Order.  Mins. of Proceedings [ECF 322]. \nIn this opinion, I set out my rationale for finding that the September 1 Order was justified \nbecause less intrusive means have failed to remedy the ongoing constitutional violations. \n4 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 5 of 15\nLEGAL STANDARD \nA party seeking modification or dissolution of an order \"bears the burden of establishing \nthat a significant change in facts or law warrants revision or dissolution\" of that order.  Sharp v. \nWeston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000). \nAs a baseline, \"[p] rinciples of federalism counsel against awarding affirmative injunctive \nand declaratory relief that would require state officials to repeal an existing law and enact a new \nlaw proposed by plaintiffs.\"  MS. v. Brown, 902 F.3d 1076, 1089 (9th Cir. 2018).  But a district \ncourt \"may ... choose a remedial measure that conflicts with state law [if] ... that measure is \nnecessary to remedy the violation.\" Hookv. Arizona Dep 't ofC  orr., 107 F.3d 1397, 1402-03 (9th \nCir. 1997); Valdivia v. Schwarzenegger, 599 F.3d 984, 995 (9th Cir. 2010). \nThis means that even \"otherwise valid state laws ... cannot stand in the way of a federal \ncourt's remedial scheme if the action is essential to enforce the scheme.\" Stone v. City & Cnty. of \nSan Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 862 (9th Cir.  1992).  Contravening valid state laws is especially \npermissible \"when the least intrusive measures [have] fail[ ed] to rectify the problems.\" Id. at 861. \nFor these cases, \"more intrusive measures are justifiable.\" Id.  Where there is a history of repeated \npast constitutional violations, \"[a] remedy may go beyond\" the \"specific conditions that violate \nthe Constitution.\" Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1247 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Hook, 107 F.3d \nat 1403 (violation of state law merited \"in the light of' a history of noncompliance).  Yet these \nremedies must take into account the costs of compliance and the steps state government officials \nare already taking; courts should generally defer to the policy choices of such officials.  Id.; see \nalso Stone, 968 F.2d at 860. \nIn short, for a federal court to override state law, the court must find that other, less \nintrusive alternatives are inadequate.  Stone, 968 F.2d at 852. \n5 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 6 of 15\nDISCUSSION \nIntervenors and Amici raise serious challenges to the September 1 Order.  In their briefing, \nthey suggest a number of ways to fix the cunent crisis.  They argue that these alternatives are less \nintrusive than the recommendations implemented in the September 1 Order and are thus the \nconect, constitutional path forward.  As discussed above, I am required to find that any less \nintrusive alternatives to  the September  1 Order are  inadequate to  remedy  the  constitutional \nviolations at issue here.  To make that finding, I must examine what Plaintiff and Defendant have \ntried, what Intervenors and Amici propose, and what the September 1 Order requires.  This will \nallow me to determine if any untried, less intrusive possibilities are adequate. \nA. Alternatives Tried \nAs noted, litigation in this case resumed in May 2019.  During the course of those three \nand a half years-and despite herculean efforts by all involved-constitutional violations against \ndefendants suffering from mental illness have not been abated.  The actions taken by Plaintiffs and \nDefendants catalogue well-thought out, less-intrusive alternatives that were tried and have failed. \nPlaintiffs initially sought to hold Defendants in contempt for their violation of the 2002 \nInjunction. They asked that Defendants be required to submit a plan for compliance and suggested \nmultiple elements to potentially be included.  These suggestions included aggressive benchmarks, \nhiring an expert to provide recommendations, educating state courts, addressing prolonged lengths \nof stay for patients who could be released due to no longer needing hospital levels of care, and \nexpanding community-based restoration and preventative services. Mot. for Order to Show Cause \n[ECF 91] at 10-11. \nEven at that time, Defendants had publicly stated that they \"had no solution\" and were \"out \nof ideas\" to fix the crisis that had been ongoing since October 2018.  Id.  at 5, 10.  They argued \n6 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 7 of 15\nthey had taken \"all reasonable steps available to comply.\" Resp. to Mot. for Order to Show Cause \n[ECF 103] at 2.  These steps included raising the total number of available beds in the face of ever \nincreasing demand, mixing populations within units to make more space, and seeking additional \nfunding for a new units and community solutions.  Id.  at 4-8.  OHA also allocated resources for \njail diversion and crisis treatment services in order to lessen the flow of individuals coming into \nthe system.  Id.  at 9.  In addition to all these endeavors, Defendants also worked with community \npartners  to  increase  services,  collaborated  with  counties,  created  an  expedited  admission \nprocedure, and proposed legislative changes.  Id at 9-10. \nIn light of these arguments, I did not find Defendants in contempt.  But I did order regular \nbriefings and hearings on efforts towards fixing the problem.  See, e.g., Min. Order [ECF 127]; \nMins.  of Proceedings  [ECF  139].  In the midst of efforts to improve the situation, a global \npandemic  strnck.  The  necessary  safety  restrictions,  requirements,  and  modifications  added \nadditional variables to the already-difficult equation of achieving compliance.  See  Order of \nModification to Inj. [ECF 167].  For example, a COVID-19 outbreak at OSH required OHA to \ncompletely pause admissions for over a month. See, e.g., Defs.' Req. to Pause Admissions Further \n[ECF 194]. \nIn 2021, orders to commit A&A patients repeatedly hit new record highs.  Defs.' Req. to \nPause Admissions Further [ECF 198].  Operating at the \"functional[] ... limit of the beds that can \nbe made available,\" there was not enough space at OSH. Id. at 3. Plaintiffs responded that I should \n\"order release of individuals to avoid constitutional violations\" and asked me to \"supersede\" the \nOregon Legislature and Oregon Judges.  Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Req. to Pause Admission [ECF 201] \nat 3.  I refused.  Min. Order [ECF 202].  Later that year, OSH was further plagued by staffing \n7 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 8 of 15\nshortages.  Pls.' Mot. to Restore Inj. [ECF 215] at 7.  These shortages required the National Guard \nto called in to alleviate the lack of personnel.  Id \nAfter a second round of settlement conferences held by my learned colleague, Judge \nBeckerman, the Parties agreed on a path forward.  OHA hired Dr. Pinals to create a comprehensive \nplan for compliance.  Stipulated Mot. to Appoint Neutral Expert [ECF 238].  Dr. Pinals is a \nprofessor at both the Law and Medical Schools of the University of Michigan and has led reform \nefforts similar to the one here in at least three states. It does not seem possible to match Dr. Pinals's \ncombination of education, experience, and effort.  She spent over six months reviewing OHA data, \nmeeting with a broad group of stakeholders from various constituencies, and writing two reports \nthat totaled over fifty pages before the Paiiies moved to implement her recommendations. Neutral \nExpe1i First Report  (\"First Report\")  [ECF  262-1];  Neutral  Expert  Second Report  (\"Second \nReport\") [ECF 262-2].  These reports describe what had been done and what steps should be taken \nto end the constitutional violations. \nThese reports, and her third, are full of less-restrictive alternatives the Parties have tried \nthat have failed to achieve compliance.  Neutral Expe1i Third Rep01i (\"Third Report\") [ECF 313-\n1]. To counteract staffing challenges, OSH has and continues to operate several accredited training \nprograms for medical professionals to recruit and retain new staff.  First Report at 8-9.  They have \nalso requested more staffing to handle increased demand.  Id. at 14.  To decrease the number of \npeople needing to go to OSH in the first place, OHA has helped fund community restoration \nservices and jail diversion programs in collaboration with counties and other partners.  Id at 9. \nOHA has also proposed a provider rate increase to encourage existing behavioral health providers \nto expand capacity in other settings.  Third Report at 18.  And to create more capacity at OSH, \nOHA even opened new units at its Junction City Campus in November 2021.  Id at 11.  This was \n8 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 9 of 15\npossible because the Oregon Legislature allocated $1.3 billion directly to this issue.  To date, none \nof these have solved the crisis. \nB. Alternatives Proposed \nIntervenors and Amici propose other steps that should be taken instead of the September 1 \nOrder.  They  contend  these  alternatives  are  less-restrictive  means  of ending  the  ongoing \nconstitutional violations.  I discuss what I take to be their main arguments below. \n(1) Amici \nAmici's first argument is to wait.  First, they contend that OSH's admissions pause during \nthe pandemic is still causing delays that will eventually work their way through the system. They \nalso point to the fact that the Oregon Legislature recently revised the statute that provides the \ncurrent framework for admittance and discharge requirements for defendants with mental health \nissues.  They argue that this new framework should be given time to  work instead of being \nmodified by the September 1 Order. \nBut the only major difference the September 1 Order imposes is shortened discharge times. \nCompare  ORS  ยง 161.371(5)(a) with September 1 Order at (3)a.-b.  Dr. Pinals's research and \nrecommendations show why these shortened discharge times may be among the most effective \nways to reach constitutional compliance, with little sacrificed in terms of system-wide outcomes. \nSecond Report at 13 (analyzing ten years of data to show how limiting patients' stays in OSH \ncould have freed up additional beds to serve over 150 more patients annually); Third Report at 12 \n(finding that, of the thousands of people treated at OSH over a ten year period, only about five \npeople per year on average were prosecuted and convicted who spent over one year in treatment); \nSecond Report at 29 (noting that, with some caveats, clinical studies of inpatient restoration report \nrestoration to be most likely between ninety days and six months); id.  at 28 (recommending the \n9 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 10 of 15\ndischarge time limits found in the September 1 Order).  As to the pandemic, those admissions \npauses at OSH took place nearly a year ago.  And it does not seem likely that waiting will improve \nanything at this point. \nNext, Amici make several arguments about increasing capacity through various means. \nThese suggestions include requiring OHA to open another facility, contract with private providers \nfor more beds, and increase its staffing to treat more patients.  However, OHA has already taken, \nor tried to take, many of these steps.  Another facility has been opened.  Rate increases have been \nproposed to encourage more private providers to offer needed services.  Staffing measures have \nbeen implemented in the face of a state-wide shortage of professionals. \nWhat's more, the measures Amici suggest are highly intrusive.  They order the state of \nOregon to make significant policy choices about how to spend sizable amounts of state resources. \nAnd they require the state to spend those funds in highly particular ways. In addition, these options \nwould take many months-if not years-to implement at a scale that would achieve the desired \nresult of constitutional compliance.  In that sense, the intrusiveness would stretch for longer than \nthe handful of months it is projected to take for the beneficial effects of the September 1 Order to \nbe fully realized. \nFinally, Amici make a handful of particular proposals to tweak OSH's admissions and \ndischarge processes in ways other than those discussed in the order.  Some of these suggestions \nhave already been implemented by Defendants, per Dr. Pinals's recommendation.  For example, \nOSH had been holding patients for thirty days after a determination was made as to their ability to \naid and assist.  Amici proposed ending this practice.  OSH has already done so, as Dr. Pinals \nrecommended.  Second Repo1i at 22. \n10 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 11 of 15\nOther suggestions relate to fine-tuning the treatment of individuals needing a Hospital \nLevel of Care (\"HLOC\"), a moratoria on admissions for those charged with misdemeanors, and \nfurther coordination of admissions, treatment, and discharges with community resources.  Dr. \nPinals addressed all of these ideas in her reports.  See,  e.g., Third Report at 14 ( discussing and \nmaking  recommendations  regarding HLOC patients);  Second Report  at  32  (doing the  same \nregarding misdemeanants and community restoration options).  She found that some of these ideas \nmight be useful or required further analysis.  As such, they may yet be implemented as part of the \npath towards compliance.  And some of these ideas-in particular, a moratoria on misdemeanant \nadmissions-almost certainly would also require contravening state law or policy.  In that sense, \nsome of these suggestions would not be any less intrusive than the September 1 Order. \n(2) Intervenors \nIntervenors are Oregon's largest health systems and operate community hospitals across \nthe state.  Their main contention is that the September 1 Order will lead to negative consequences \nthat  will  directly  affect  them  and  cause  additional  constitutional  violations.  Because  the \nSeptember 1 Order shortens the maximum time that patients can spend at OSH, Intervenors argue \nthat these patients will be released before they are ready to be returned to their communities. \nUntreated to the extent they should be, these patients will decompensate.  And the September 1 \nOrder also bars civilly committed (\"CC\") patients from admission to OHA unless they meet the \nexpedited admissions criteria.  September 1 Order at (2)b.  So with more patients decompensating, \nand without OSH as an option to which to return, Intervenors believe Oregon state courts will \ninstead order patients to be civilly committed-at Intervenors' hospitals. \nIntervenors argue this impermissibly prioritizes GEI and A&A patients over CC patients \nand violates those patients' (and Intervenors') constitutional rights.  According to Intervenors, \n11 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 12 of 15\nhospital settings are not appropriate for CC patients because they are designed to stabilize and \nmanage acute symptoms.  They do not provide long-term care and help patients recover from their \nmental illness.  This allegedly creates a constitutional violation because CC persons must be \nprovided \"with access to mental health treatment that gives them a realistic opportunity\" to be \n\"cured or improve the mental condition for which they were confined.\" Sharp v.  Weston, 233 F.3d \n1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2000).  Intervenors also claim that having more CC patients in their facilities \nwill lead to more violence against their employees and divert resources away from other areas of \ncare. \nTo remedy this alleged violation, Intervenors contend that the September 1 Order should \nbe modified.  They argue that the provision that requires CC patients to meet the expedited \nadmission criteria should be removed.  They also suggest changes to the admission and discharge \ncriteria for HLOC patients. \nAlthough Dr. Pinals did not meet with these particular Intervenors in preparing her reports, \nshe did understand the civil commitment process and took it into account when making her \nrecommendations.  See, e.g., First Report at 3-4 (showing review of documents related to the civil \ncommitment process); id.  at 9 (describing a meeting with OHA staff at which CC patients were \ndiscussed). Furthe1more, Intervenors, at least one Amici, and Dr. Pinals all agree that the provision \nof the September 1 Order that requires CC patients to meet the expedited admission criteria merely \nformalizes a longstanding OHA policy.  Deel. of Alicia Beymer, Chief Administrative Office for \n,r \nPeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center  4 [ECF 282]; Deel. of Nicholas Ocon, Behavioral \n,r \nHealth Division Manager, Washington County  7 [ECF 278]; Second Report at 15 (noting that \nCC patients have had limited access to OSH). \n12 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 13 of 15\nWithout addressing the merits of the constitutional question, it stands to reason that GEI \nand A&A patients-who have been charged with a crime-will in most cases be more dangerous \nto others than CC patients. It therefore makes sense to prioritize their admission to OSH and only \nallow highly dangerous CC patients access. That is exactly what the expedited admission criteria \ndoes. With limited resources, choices must be made. The requirement that CC patients must meet \nthe expedited admissions policy is therefore a necessary part of the September 1 Order and an \nimportant piece of the solution to the ongoing constitutional violations. \nC. Alternative in Progress\nI have now considered all of the measures taken to achieve compliance with the 2002 \nInjunction, up to the point of the September 1 Order.  I have also considered the alternatives \nsuggested by Intervenors and Amici.  With the greatest respect for everyone's work done to this \npoint, I find that all less-intrusive means have failed to rectify the constitutional violations.2  This \njustifies more intrusive measures.  And at this point, the alternatives proposed by Intervenors and \nAmici appear to be inadequate to address the crisis.  Their submissions, at this point, have not \nshown any significant change in facts or law warrants revision or dissolution of the September 1 \nOrder.  After a four-year history of noncompliance and nearly $1.3 billion spent, the Constitution \ndemands a more intrusive solution. \nThat solution is the September 1 Order, including its provisions that arguably infringe on \nstate law.  But as the state itself acknowledged at oral argument, \n[T]he subject of how the State Hospital can best meet its obligations has been the\nsubject of litigation for some years now, and the request was made by the plaintiffs \nin the past for this Court to enter an order that would override state law, and at that \n2 \nI have also found some of the proposals to be, in fact, more intrusive. \n13 -OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 14 of 15\ntime we have always been able to come back to this Court and say, hang on, we \nhave ideas for things that we can do within the system, within the structure that has \nbeen created, and my clients have really moved heaven and earth with an awful lot \nof things coming at them to keep moving forward .... OHA is continuing to move \nheaven and earth .... [W]e did not oppose the motion this time because we have \nrun out of the ability to tell you we have a plan for coming back into compliance \nunder the system as it is now.  We don't have a reason to tell you that we can do \nthis without something like this Court's September 1st order. \nNovember 21, 2022 Oral Argument Tr. [ECF 328] at 62-63. \nIn upholding this  order,  I must consider the costs of compliance and the  steps state \ngovernment officials are already taking. As much as possible, I should generally defer to the policy \nchoices of such officials.  Here, the state has chosen to rely on a neutral expert.  That expe1t has \nstated that: \n[I]t is my opinion, with agreement of the patties, that as a total package the prior \nrecommendations hold the most realistic potential for long-term and sustainable \nachievement of ... compliance .... The data projections support that the recent \ncomt orders hold further promise for a more expedited remedy that will help the \nstate achieve the seven-day ... admission parameters. \nThird Report at  12.  In pmticulmยท,  she noted that the  September 1 Order's \"prioritization of \nadmissions to those meeting expedited clinical criteria\" and the \"shorten[ing] [o f] the maximum \ndmation of restoration allowable at OSH\" were \"consistent with the recommendations set forth in \nmy Second Rep01t[,] ... with clinical experience[,] and other state examples ....\"   Id. at 15. \n14 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 338    Filed 01/09/23    Page 15 of 15\nAs such, I deny Intervenors' Motion to Dissolve or Modify the September 1 Order.  But I \ndo so with leave to renew.  The September 1 Order must be given time to work and for its effects \nto  materialize.  If all  goes to  plan,  it will enable the  state to  achieve  compliance with the \nConstitution next year, for the first time in nearly half a decade.  However, if it does not, other \nmeasures will be needed.  For now, the solution to this state-wide humanitarian crisis remains a \nwork in progress. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated on the record and above, I DENY Intervenors' Motion to Dissolve \nor Modify [ECF 284] the September 1 Order, with leave to renew. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this~ of January, 2023. \n15  OPINION AND ORDER ",

I held a court trial\n1 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 2 of 14\non April 8, 2002.  After consideration of the evidence adduced and the arguments submitted, these are\nmy Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:\nFindings of Fact\n1.  Plaintiff Oregon Advocacy Center (\"OAC\") is a federally funded non-profit law office\nrepresenting the rights of people with disabilities.  Under the Protection and Advocacy for the Mentally\nIll Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 10805, OAC is charged with the authority to protect the rights of individuals with\nmental illness.  Some criminal defendants are determined by the Circuit Courts of Oregon to be unfit to\nproceed to trial because of mental incapacities (hereinafter referred to simply as being \"unfit\" or \"unable\nto proceed\").  See ORS ยง 161.370(2).  These \"unfit to proceed\" defendants fall within the scope of\nOACโs mandate, and are its constituents.\n2.  Plaintiff OAC represents people with mental illness and provides the means to protect their\ncollective interests.  The organization advocates for those found unable to proceed to trial in various\nways, including representing individual clients and litigating to establish limits on the amount of time\npeople may be held at state hospitals because they have been found unfit to proceed.\n3.  Plaintiff Metropolitan Public Defender Services, Inc., (\"MPD\") is a nonโprofit corporation\nrepresenting indigent criminal defendants in Multnomah and Washington Counties in Oregon.  Because\nof defendantsโ delays in accepting custody of persons found unfit to proceed, MPD suffers ongoing\ninjury because its ability to represent its clientsโ interests is impaired, and because the delays compel\nMPD to expend additional resources to effectively represent clients who are incarcerated while\nawaiting hospitalization.  As a result of delays of weeks and months in getting a client admitted to the\nstate hospital, MPD is forced to use its limited resources to attempt to keep the client advised of his or\n2 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 3 of 14\nher status, address difficult questions from the client's family, stay in contact with the jail personnel\nregarding the limited psychiatric treatment that may be available, and attend additional court calls to\nexplain to the judge that the client is still awaiting the court-ordered placement and treatment.  These\nresponsibilities deprive MPD attorneys of time and energy needed for other cases, draining MPDโs\nresources and frustrating its mission.  Similarly, John Connors, Multnomah County Director for MPD, is\nrequired to repeatedly address the problems created by defendants' delays in providing the court-\nordered hospitalization of his clients, thereby diverting him from his other duties.\n4.  Plaintiff A.J. Madison was incarcerated in the Multnomah County Jail on March 5, 2002,\nthe date he was found unable to aid and assist.  He was charged with assaulting his mother with a\nsledge hammer, a crime that by itself is indicative of serious mental illness.  Madison did not understand\nwhy he was in jail or the severity of the charges against him, and suffered severe anxiety because he\nwas not being treated properly.  He was not admitted to Oregon State Hospital (\"OSH\") until March\n28, 2002, 23 days after he was found unfit to proceed.  \n5.  Madison's psychological evaluation indicates he cannot participate in an appropriate\nexchange of information, and cannot reason well enough to make proper decisions about relevant\ninformation.  In order for him to return to competency to stand trial at a later date, Madison requires\nspecialized medications and treatment.  \n6.  Plaintiffs provided a list of other clients experiencing significant delays in obtaining transfer\nand treatment.  Defendants did not dispute the assertions that clients have suffered, and are suffering,\ndelays of weeks and months before being admitted into the state hospital.  As of March 25, 2002, the\n3 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 4 of 14\nhearing date for plaintiffs' motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, OSH\nhad a list of 11 \"unable to proceed\" defendants awaiting transport.\n7.  Oregon law provides that โif the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to\nproceed, the proceeding against the defendant shall be suspended. . . and the court shall commit the\ndefendant to the custody of the superintendent of a state mental hospital designated by the Department\nof Human Services.โ  ORS ยง161.370(2).  The law permitted the Mental Health Division to designate a\nstate mental hospital โor other treatment facilityโ for commitment.  Oregon has forensic units at both\nOSH and Eastern Oregon Psychiatric Center, and Oregon's state hospitals provide locked wards.  The\nEastern Oregon Psychiatric Center houses forensic patients (those who have been charged or\nconvicted of crimes).  The Division never designated a facility other than OSH for admission of \"unable\nto proceed\"defendants, however.  The law formerly provided โthe defendant shall be transported to the\nhospital or treatment facility as soon as practicable.  Transport shall be completed within seven days\nafter the courtโs determination unless doing so would jeopardize the health or safety of the defendant or\nothers.โ  ORS ยง161.370(3).  The current statute is silent on how quickly transport must occur.\n8.  Plaintiffs' clients are incarcerated in various county jails in Oregon while awaiting transfer to\nOSH.  These jails have a varying, limited capacity to accommodate these clients. \nDeschutes County Jail has an inmate population of 200, and has one full-time psychologist and\na psychiatrist who comes in once a week to review medication.  There is a single location in the facility\nat which inmates can be monitored visually.  \n4 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 5 of 14\nLincoln County Jail has 150 inmates, one full-time inmate counselor, and a psychiatric nurse\npractitioner who comes in four hours per week for medication management.  The jail's ability to care for\nmentally ill inmates is rudimentary.  \nWashington County Jail houses approximately 485 people, and staffs a psychiatric nurse\npractitioner who does pharmacology, and a social worker and community liaison.  The jail lacks people\nwho are trained to care for mentally ill people.  \nThe Clackamas County Jail has 494 inmates, and one psychologist who comes into the jail five\ndays a week for eight hours to provide counseling.  A psychiatrist works four hours a week, a nurse\npractitioner works four hours a week, and a psychiatric nurse works eight hours per week. \nLane County Jail houses 451 inmates, and staffs one consulting psychiatrist who comes in once\na week to provide medication management, and a full-time mental health specialist who provides crisis\nmanagement.  \nJosephine County Jail houses approximately 170 inmates.  There is virtually no mental health\ntreatment in the jail.  Until recently, the only available treatment was crisis intervention services from\noutside the jail.  Medication is available through a clinic, but an inmate cannot be involuntarily\nmedicated.  The jail has standard restraints, including a restraint chair, and a control technician to\nmonitor prisoners every 15 minutes when necessary.  \nThe Multnomah County Jails house a population of approximately 1,800 persons, and maintain\na mental health services staff consisting of a half-time psychiatrist, who functions as psychiatric medical\ndirector; a full-time psychiatric nurse practitioner, a contract nurse practitioner, another psychiatrist who\nworks eight hours per week on a contractual basis, and 10 additional mental health staff, composed\n5 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 6 of 14\nprimarily of psychiatric nurses or mental health consultants.  The Multnomah County Sheriffโs Office\nprovides some mental health treatment, but its primary responsibility is jail safety.  It lacks expertise and\nresources to provide treatment designed to care for the mentally ill and to restore competency.\n9.  Jails can provide medication management for people who are willing to take medications,\nbut cannot administer medication involuntarily, except in a life-threatening emergency.  When resources\npermit, treatment for \"unfit to proceed\" defendants may possibly include basic clinical psychiatry and\nintervention.  Such treatment is designed to stabilize the inmate.  However, some inmates, particularly\nthose with personality disorders, refuse or do not respond to medication, and do not otherwise respond\nto the treatment the jails can provide.\n10.  None of the jails in which these persons are held is able to provide treatment designed to\nrestore a person found unfit to proceed to competency.  People found unfit to proceed are often overtly\npsychotic and require special housing or segregation.  They are unpredictable and disruptive, taking up\nvaluable resources needed for the care of other inmates.  If they refuse to take medications, they often\ndecompensate rapidly.  They often are confined in their cells for 22 to 23 hours a day because of their\nbehavior.  This exacerbates their mental illness.\n11.  Necessarily, the jails' only system for controlling inmates is disciplinary, which is behavior-\ndriven.  Such a system is ineffective for mentally ill persons, and possibly harmful.\n12.  Unlike the county jails, OSH has the capacity to treat a personโs mental illness.  Each of\nthe units housing persons found unfit to proceed is staffed by a full-time psychiatrist, a psychologist, a\nmental health specialist, a recreation counselor, a social worker, a mental health technician and nurses. \n6 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 7 of 14\n13.  In addition to assessment, medication evaluation and management, and individual and\ngroup psychotherapy, OSH provides legal skills training three times a week to assist patients in learning\nabout the law, pleas, and returning to court.  This treatment is designed to enable a person to regain\nfitness to proceed to trial.  \n14.  The Oregon State Hospital provides status reports to OAC each time a person is\nevaluated as to his or her continued unfitness to proceed.  The report contains a copy of the order\nfinding the person unfit to proceed, and indicates the date on which the person was accepted by OSH. \nThese records have been compiled by OAC since October, 2001.\n15.  A review of 105 records reveals that persons found unfit to proceed in 2001 and 2002\nspent an average of 31.98 days awaiting transport to OSH.  Only 19 persons were transported within\nseven days or less; 48 people were held for 30 days or more, and nine people were held for 60 days or\nmore.  The ten longest periods of time people were held in this period are as follows:  166 days, 102\ndays, 84 days, 82 days, 78 days, 68 days, 65 days, 63 days, and 57 days.\n16.  The delays experienced by some persons who were found unfit to proceed in 2001 and\n2002 and detained in Multnomah County Jails between July 1 and October 15, 2001, are\nrepresentative.  Eleven inmates who were found unfit to proceed were held for a total of 471 days\nawaiting transport to OSH; the longest wait lasted 111 days, the next 102 days, and the next 81 days. \nThe shortest period of time was seven days.  As recently as February 15, 2002, one client had waited\n87 days for placement. \n17.  Promptly admitting persons found unfit to proceed is critical.  This population has a high\nsuicide risk, and psychosis can be an emergency requiring immediate treatment. \n7 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 8 of 14\n18.  Indefinitely imprisoning persons deemed unfit to proceed without adequate treatment is\nunjust and inhumane.  Depriving them of necessary medical treatment increases the likelihood that they\nmay decompensate and suffer unduly.  The delays also hamper efforts to provide effective\nrepresentation regarding their criminal prosecution.\n19.  The delays also result in possible injury to a defendantโs procedural rights.  Under state\nlaw, a re-evaluation must take place within 60 days of the time defendant is committed to the custody of\nthe state hospital.  However, as the client spends weeks and months in jail awaiting hospitalization, that\nevaluation is delayed.  Relatedly, people have a right to have their cases tried within 60 days of being\ncharged, if they are in custody.  However, for people declared to be unable to aid and assist, delays in\nthe subsequent evaluative process can postpone the opportunity for a trial for much longer than 60\ndays. \n20.  The jails have the capacity to transport inmates to a treatment facility within 24 hours. The\nreason they do not transport the inmates is because defendants refuse to accept them.\n21.  Sheriff Noelle attempted to implement a policy of transporting \"unable to proceed\" persons\nto the state hospital within 72 hours.  There is no dispute this policy has failed because defendants have\nrefused to accept custody.  Jail personnel are compelled to incarcerate these persons until the hospital\nagrees to admit them.  As a result, the court-ordered admissions are delayed until the jails are notified\nthat a hospital bed is available.\n22.  Every day of delay in transport harms those found unfit to proceed and hampers their\nability to defend themselves.  Attorneys and investigators are impaired by having to prepare a case\nmonths after the incident has occurred.  The treatment-deprived client cannot provide information to the\n8 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 9 of 14\nattorney, a defense cannot be prepared, and witnesses who may be critical to the case cannot be\nidentified and may be unavailable at a later time.  Trials, pleas and other means of resolving\nprosecutions are delayed while these defendants are incarcerated and awaiting eventual hospital\nadmission and treatment. \n\\\\\\\nConclusions of Law\n1.  Plaintiff OAC has standing to represent the interests of persons who are presently or may in\nthe future be unfit to stand trial, and to seek a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment\nestablishing the time frames within which due process requires that they be transported from county jails\nto a treatment facility.  See United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown\nGroup, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 552-53 (1996); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising\nCommission, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977) (an association may bring suit on behalf of its members or\nconstituents despite the fact that individual members have not actually brought suit themselves); Warth\nv. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (even in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have\nstanding solely as the representative of its members); see also Fair Housing of Marin v. Combs, 285\nF.3d 899, 904-05 (9th Cir. 2002) (Ninth Circuit upholds \"organizational standing\" for nonprofit fair\nhousing organization suing an apartment owner for discriminatory conduct; direct standing to sue is\nappropriate because the agency showed a drain on its resources from both a diversion of its resources\nand frustration of its mission); Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879, 882-84 (11th Cir. 1999) (it has \"long\nbeen settled that an organization has standing to sue to redress injuries suffered by its members without\n9 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 10 of 14\na showing of injury to the association itself and without a statute explicitly permitting associational\nstanding;\" a protective and advocacy organization \"may sue on behalf of its constituents during the\ncourse of their treatment or within ninety days after being discharged from a treatment facility pursuant\nto ยง 10805(a)(1)(B), (C), subject. . . to the requirements of Article III as laid out in Hunt and its\nprogeny\").\n2.  Plaintiff MPD has organizational standing to represent its own interests, and to obtain\npermanent injunctive and declaratory relief because of injury to itself resulting from defendantsโ practice\nof delaying admission of persons found unfit to proceed.  See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\nU.S. 363, 379 (1982).\n3.  Constitutional questions regarding the conditions and circumstances of pretrial confinement\nare properly addressed under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.  See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 683 (9th Cir. 2001) (liberty is\nprotected from unlawful state deprivation by the Due Process Clause), quoting Haygood v. Younger,\n769 F.2d 1350, 1354 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc).\n4.  An individual has a liberty interest in being free from incarceration absent a criminal\nconviction.  See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 (1979) (Supreme Court recognizes individual\nhas liberty interest in being free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction; no unlawful deprivation\nwhere a person was deprived of this liberty for a period of days by means of due process).  A court\nmust consider the constitutionality of a detention in light of the detention's purpose, determine whether\nthe detention is based on permissible goals, and, if it is, evaluate whether the detention is excessive in\nrelation to those goals.  See Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972) (\"due process requires\n10 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 11 of 14\nthat the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the\nindividual is committed\").\n5.  In determining the appropriate due process due to incompetent detainees, the United States\nSupreme Court has held due process requires, at a minimum, some rational relation between the nature\nand duration of confinement and its purpose.  See Jackson, 406 U.S. at 730 (condemning petitioner to\n\"permanent institutionalization\" without requisite showing for commitment or the opportunity for release\ndeprived petitioner of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment).  \n6.  The \"purpose\" of holding someone unfit to stand trial in custody arises from his or her\nconfirmed mental illness.  The state's interest in such detentions is to assist in restoring competency, not\nto punish the person.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979) (under the Due Process Clause,\na pretrial detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process\nof law).\n7.  A determination of constitutionally adequate treatment for plaintiffs' clients must be\nmeasured not by that which must be provided to the general prison population, but that which must be\nprovided to those committed for mental incapacity.  See Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775, 777 (9th\nCir. 1981) (persons held due to mental illness have a constitutional right to receive such individual\ntreatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve mental condition).\n8.  Institutionalized persons have a substantive due process liberty interest in reasonable care\nand safety, reasonably non-restrictive confinement conditions, and such treatment as may be required to\ncomport fully with the purposes of confinement.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 319 (1982)\n11 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 12 of 14\n(mentally retarded individual committed in state institution has liberty interests requiring state to provide\nminimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint).  \n9.  The county jails in Oregon have no capacity to provide mental health treatment that is\ndesigned to rehabilitate a person or restore the person to competency.  The treatment the jails offer to\npersons found unfit to proceed is the same treatment offered to any jail inmate.  Such treatment is\nconstitutionally inadequate.  See Lynch v. Baxley, 744 F.2d 1452, 1458 (11th Cir. 1984) (temporary\nconfinement in jail is particularly harmful to those who are mentally ill, exacerbating the mental problems\nof people detained, and lengthening treatment duration). \n10.  The care Oregon State Hospital is able to offer is tailored to the needs of persons found\nunfit to stand trial, and fulfills constitutional requirements.  The hospital has the capacity to medicate\npatients, and has specially trained staff and staffing levels and programs sufficient to treat patientsโ\nmental incapacity. \n11.  Persons who are found unfit to stand trial and remain in jail suffer constitutionally\ncognizable harm, and are entitled to prompt treatment in a rehabilitative facility.  Even short periods of\nincarceration of these persons can cause cognizable harm.  See Lynch, 744 F.2d at 1458.\n12.  There is no rationalization that passes constitutional muster for unreasonably detaining\npersons found unfit to proceed in county jails.  The lack of funds, staff or facilities cannot justify\ndefendantsโ failure to provide persons found unfit with the treatment that is necessary to attempt\nrestoration of competency.  See Ohlinger, 652 F.2d at 779.  Defendants found to be unfit to proceed\nmust be transferred as soon as practicable to a treatment facility, and should be detained only for that\n12 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 13 of 14\nperiod of time necessary to identify the person, determine the appropriate legal status, and effectuate\ntransport. \n13.  Persons found unfit to proceed and held in county jails for more than a brief period suffer\ndelays in receiving restorative treatment, which delays their return to competency, prolonging their\ncriminal cases and making it difficult for their attorneys to learn from their clients about the crime or\ncrimes charged, to identify witnesses, and to enter into plea negotiations.  It also delays the statutorily\nmandated competency review (required to be held within 60 days of entering the hospital). \nAccordingly, defendants' procedures and practices also violate the procedural due process rights of\npersons found unfit to proceed.\n14.  Defendants are aware their policies and conduct results in delays (which are sometimes\nsubstantial) in fulfilling court orders directing the hospitalization of persons found unable to proceed, and\nthey are aware that such persons receive inadequate care and are possibly harmed while detained in\ncounty jails awaiting admission.  Nevertheless, defendants have refused to pursue or adopt policies to\nensure prompt admission and treatment for these persons.  This demonstrates a deliberate indifference\nto these persons' health, safety and constitutional rights.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-05\n(1976).  Moreover, defendants' policies are a substantial departure from professionally accepted\nminimum standards for treatment of incompetent individuals for whom defendants are responsible.  See\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323; see also Turay v. Seling, 108 F. Supp. 2d 1148 (W.D. Wash. 2000),\naff'd sub nom. Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir. 2000).\n15.  This court concludes defendants have violated, and are violating, the due process rights of\ncriminal defendants who are determined by the Circuit Courts of Oregon to be unfit to proceed to trial\n13 - FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 47    Filed 05/10/02    Page 14 of 14\nbecause of mental incapacities under ORS ยง 161.370(2).  Such persons have a right to a reasonably\ntimely transport to a treatment facility pursuant to the expectations and directions of the court issuing\nfindings and orders under that statute.\nACCORDINGLY, IT IS SO ORDERED:\nThis court orders defendants to ensure that persons who are declared unable to proceed to trial\npursuant to ORS ยง 161.370(2) be committed to the custody of the superintendent of a state hospital\ndesignated by the Department of Human Services as soon as practicable.  This shall be fulfilled by\nproviding full admission of such persons into a state mental hospital or other treatment facility so\ndesignated by the Department of Human Services, in accordance with Oregon's existing applicable\nstatutory provisions.  These admissions must be done in a reasonably timely manner, and completed not\nlater than seven days after the issuance of an order determining a criminal defendant to be unfit to\nproceed to trial because of mental incapacities under ORS ยง 161.370(2).\nDATED this 9th  day of May, 2002.\n/s/ Owen M.

D. \nBoard Certified in Psychiatry, Forensic Psychiatry, and Certified in Addiction Medicine \n \nNeutral Expert First Report \nRegarding the Consolidated Mink and Bowman Cases \n \n \n \nDate of Report: January 30, 2022 \nNeutral Expert: Debra A. Pinals, M.D. \nBackground and Context of this Report \nOn 12/21/21, the Honorable Michael W. Mosman, U.S. District Judge for the United States District Court \nfor the District of Oregon, Portland Division, entered an order appointing me, Dr. Debra Pinals, as a \nneutral expert in granting a Stipulated Motion from defendants at the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) \nand the Oregon State Hospital (OSH) and Plaintiffs Jarrod Bowman, Joshawn Douglas-Simpson, Disability \nRights Oregon, Metropolitan Public Defender Services, Inc., and A.J. Madison. The Courtโs order \nconsolidates two cases, Bowman et al v. Matteucci et al (Case Number: 3:21-cv-01637-MO) and Oregon \nAdvocacy Center et al v. Mink et al (Case Number: 3:02-cv-00339-MO) and identifies Mink as the lead \ncase. Through this consolidation, the Bowman case was reassigned from the Honorable Marco A. \nHernandez to Judge Mosman. \n \nJudge Mosmanโs order stipulates further that OHA enter into a contract with the neutral expert and \nprovide any needed information to her.  Further, the Court ordered that the neutral expert should \nโmake recommendations to address capacity issues at the Oregon State Hospital.โ The order delineates \nthat the first report from the neutral expert, due 1/31/22, shall include โsuggested admissions protocol \nthat addresses the admission of patients found unable to aid and assist in their own defense under ORS \n161.370 (.370 patients) as well as patients found to be Guilty Except for Insanity (GEI patients).โ  The \nCourt further ordered a second report by the neutral expert, due by 4/29/22 that should include โa \nshort report and recommendations for a proposed long-term compliance plan for OSH.โ \n \nThis report represents the first report of the appointed Neutral Expert in this matter.  \nBackground and Summary of the Two Consolidated Cases \nOregon Advocacy Center (now known as Disability Rights Oregon) filed a civil rights lawsuit against the \nstate of Oregon alleging that the state was failing to timely admit individuals found incompetent to \nstand trial (unable to aid and assist) who were ordered to Oregon State Hospital for competence to \nstand trial restoration. The ruling out of the Ninth Circuit (OAC v. Mink) found on behalf of plaintiffs that \nthe State was out of compliance and must admit these individuals within seven (7) days .In June 2019 \nthe court compelled the state to get in compliance with Mink within 90 days, and although the state met \nits burden at the time, compliance with the ruling became challenging once again with the pandemic \ncreating other barriers to compliance. The state filed a motion requesting greater latitude in admitting \nindividuals in the aid and assist process to mitigate spread of COVID-19. That motion was granted, and \nDisability Rights Oregon appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit issued an order \nvacating the modification but also sought review by the District Court Judge to review his admissions \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \norder. In December 2021, the parties entered an interim settlement agreement that involved the \nappointment of the neutral expert to provide recommendations as noted above. \nIn November 2021, plaintiffs Jarod Bowman and Joshawn Douglas-Simpson brought action against the \nOregon State Hospital (OSH) and Oregon Health Authority (OHA) for failure to timely admit them as \nindividuals adjudicated Guilty Except for Insanity (GEI) by the Multnomah County Circuit Court, after the \nHonorable Nan Waller had ordered them to OSH for treatment, without unreasonable delay. The \nplaintiffs remained, however at the Multnomah County Detention Center for months (Plaintiff Bowman \nfor nearly eight months, and Plaintiff Douglas-Simpson for nearly six months) after the commitment \norder was issued. Plaintiffs alleged a violation of their substantive due process rights, and filed a motion \nfor a Temporary Restraining Order asking for plaintiffs to be transported to OSH within seven days of the \norder. The defendants argued that a lack of space at OSH, in part related to the need to timely admit \nindividuals in the aid and assist process, contributed to the delays in admitting the patients. The court \ngranted the plaintiffsโ motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, noting that โThe Mink injunction does \nnot address the relative priority of aid-and-assist patients and GEI patientsโฆโ noting that โany \nprioritization stems from Defendantโs failure to provide the funds, staff, and facilities necessary to \nsatisfy the constitutional rights of both groups. When satisfying constitutional guarantees, Defendants \ncannot rob Peter to pay Paul.โ In that opinion, The Honorable Marco A. Hernandez, United States \nDistrict Court Judge did agree with the defendants that a consolidation of the Mink and Bowman cases \nmay make sense, thought the response to the motion would not be affected by that consolidation. As \nnoted above, subsequent to that decision about the Temporary Restraining Order and the two specific \nplaintiffs and at the time of the appointment of the neutral expert, the parties entered an interim \nagreement that no individuals found GEI would wait longer than four months for admission to OSH.  \nQualifications to Perform this Consultation \nIn rendering the opinions in this report, I relied upon my training and experience after almost twenty-\nfive years as a clinical and academic and forensic psychiatrist, and over twenty years functioning in state \nand local level administrative leadership, management, clinical treatment, forensic evaluation, and \nconsultative roles across several U.S. jurisdictions. My experience includes evaluating individuals in civil \nand criminal processes including competence to stand trial (Aid and Assist) and criminal responsibility \n(GEI), consulting to community and hospital behavioral health systems regarding care and treatment of \ncomplex patients and writing, advising on, and revising policy pertaining to individuals in forensic \nprocesses, among others. \nSources \nIn order to help inform the recommendations contained in this report, I reviewed the following \ninformation: \n1.

The SRTF level does not require the same \nlevel of nursing or line staff.  \n \nStaffing challenges have been a major issue for OSH.  Staffing allocations require approval from a nurse \nstaffing committee that determines appropriate staffing levels per bargaining unit contracts. In addition \nto their assessments, a multidisciplinary workgroup with various union representatives identified \nneeded staffing levels. To hire into positions, there must be both financial resources and staffing level \nauthority for additional positions within OSH. Thus, at this time, the currently required staffing levels \nexceed budget allocations and staffing level authorization. A staffing report was presented to Ways and \nMeans but OSH leadership, but has not yet been approved.   \n \nThe waitlist is managed regularly with staff assigned to admissions process especially. A protocol has \nbeen in place for some time to allow for sheriffs to request expedited admission. In Quarter 4 of 2021 \n(Oct, Nov, Dec), there was one (1) expedited admission for a patient on an OSH admission order as a \nGEI, and the admission was expedited due to a suicide attempt in the jail. There was some discussion \nwith DRO regarding updating the expedited admissions protocol but the parties agreed that any efforts \nto examine this required further conversation. Two (2) patients went ahead in the waitlist during the \nfourth quarter of 2021. Both were admitted as GEI revocations per the PSRB. \n \nThe hospital leadership noted that there is a growing number of patients on the 9b list identified as no \nlonger needing hospital level of care (see Table 3). There have been several initiatives that have proven \nsome success in facilitating discharge of patients, including the recent MOOVRS group, which focuses on \nindividuals in the A&A, GEI and 701 processes, as well as prior efforts with the Oregon Performance Plan \nwith civil patients (that included metrics for length of stay and ready to place timelines), and the Person-\nDirected Transition Team supports.  \n \nClinical staff explained their perspectives on delays in medicating for individuals who refuse medication \nrelated to their underlying mental health condition who may not have capacity to make treatment \ndecisions. The legal processes can create delays and ultimate non-restorability determinations may be \nthe result regardless due to the level of severity of the illnesses people exhibit. \nAccording to OSH leadership, there are often several hearings per week addressing individual court \ncontempt findings for failure to timely admit individuals. For each of these contempt hearings, there is a \nresource of testimony required from clinical and administrative staff who are then unable to perform \nthe oversight and treatment functions that would expedite other admissions.  \nAccording to OSH staff with whom I spoke, it is not uncommon to be dealing with transport delays by \nsome sheriffs for admissions. Although there may be legitimate issues with transport, this can extend \nwaiting periods in jail and create additional administrative burden, not to mention distress and \nconfusion for the persons committed to OSH who may be expecting to leave jail.  \n8 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nDespite its challenges, OSH offers many very promising services. The professional staff shared with me \ntheir backgrounds and passion for the work that they do, and even in these difficult times, their \ncommitment is clear. They also noted that OSH continues to operate several accredited training \nprograms for psychologists and psychiatrists and others that have been great sources for recruitment \nand retention of new professional staff.  \n \nMeetings regarding Forensic Evaluation Services: Initial competency evaluations were discussed across \nmeetings. The increased volume of A&A orders had been striking (See Figure 1 above). The demand for \nevaluations and re-evaluations made it difficult to achieve timely evaluations. There was a common \ntheme among persons I spoke with that seemed to suggest there were inefficiencies in evaluation \nprocesses as it relates to compliance, yet there were several solutions offered including centralization \nand decentralization of the evaluation services. It appeared that certification had not shifted the \nefficiencies and there can be limited qualified evaluators in particular regions. Besides initial evaluations, \nre-evaluations of A&A for those committed to OSH are increasingly impacted, and there are delays in \nA&A evaluations in light of the additional demands on FES. Forensic evaluators at OSH often are \nspending time gathering information for cases that are dismissed. In addition, I was told that time is \nspent locating defendants who no-show, yet continue to be awaiting an evaluation service.  \n \nCommunity Behavioral Health and OHA: In my preliminary meeting with several OHA staff, I was given a \nprimer on Oregon services pertaining to the A&A, GEI and civil populations vis a vis admission to OSH. In \norder to best understand how to form recommendations regarding admissions, it also is important to \nunderstand discharges and potential strategies to divert from arrest and sustain community stability to \navoid rehospitalization. Data indicated that those in the A&A process were most likely to return to OSH \ncompared to other populations. Thus much of this information relates to both aspects of the system. \n \nCommunity restoration services have recently been funded by OHA to augment funding through \nMedicaid of โtreatment as usualโ services in the community. OHA developed contracts to assist with \ncommunity restoration services, and counties have chosen different uses for those dollars.  \nOf note, the current statute for community restoration has no requirement of maximum time spent in \nrestoration or timing for evaluations. There are also community funds for jail diversion as well as some \nlocalities that have CCBHCs, which promote collaboration between behavioral health and other \ncommunity members including law enforcement and jails to reduce likelihood of arrest. According to a \npresentation to the legislature, there have been some CCBHCs that were closed but some that were able \nto open, and OHA is interested in sustaining these programs. IMPACTS grants have been made available \nto several counties as another innovation for the state, managed by CJC. \n \nStaff indicated that the Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB) manages approximately 650 GEI cases \ninvolving approximately 640 unique individuals, and that 240 of those are at OSH, and the other 400 are \nin the community.  The PSRB reviews risk mitigation plans for admissions and for discharges from OSH.  \nSeveral years ago there was the initiation of the State Hospital Review Panel (SHRP), which was invoked \nto review discharges in lieu of the PSRB for individuals found GEI on less severe offenses such as \nmisdemeanor and non-person crimes. The SHRP was dissolved by statute when the low-level \nmisdemeanors were ultimately discharged from OSH. There is some effort to track whether this \nimprovement in timely discharges has reversed itself since the SHRP was dissolved. \n \nOHA has identified Northwest Regional Reentry Center (NWRRC) as a potential stepdown site for some \nindividuals committed to OSH when appropriate clinically. However, there has been mixed engagement \n9 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nregarding the use of the NWRRC facilities across counties. Also, there have been some concerns raised \nas this facility is not designed as a psychiatric treatment facility, and as such it is important that \nappropriate level of care determinations and monitoring is conducted for these placements. \n \nOHA described numerous innovations to help expand community capacity, and the staff with whom I \nspoke were knowledgeable and dedicated to these efforts. \nMeetings with Patients at OSH \nI met with six (6) patients all together. Three (3) were in the A&A process and three (3) were in the GEI \nsystem, all of whom agreed to speak to me. I focused my meetings on their current status and their \nexperiences in the community and gathered no personal identifying information in order to preserve \nconfidentiality. I explained my role to the individuals and told them that my speaking to them was solely \nto inform my thinking about systems issues and decreasing jail wait-times as a whole and that nothing \nspecific about them would be identified in the report.   \nPatient 1.  This man appeared to be approximately in his 20s. He was in the GEI system having been at \nOSH for about five (5) years. He noted that he would be returning to live with his parents, and would \nneed rides, and a place to go for his medications. He stated that his admission was a result of his step \ndown from a group home where his medication adherence was monitored, and his having stopped \nmedications at his next placement. He was not sure of what wrap-around supports he received at the \nsecond placement. \nPatient 2. This man also was in the GEI system, and was estimated to be approximately in his 30s. He \nhad been at OSH since approximately 2018. He recalled waiting in jail prior to admission. He felt that the \ncommunity system had been pretty good, but that his doctor told him he could go off his medication. He \nhad been homeless prior to admission. He was not sure where he would be living after discharge. He \nstated that there are many steps involved in the PSRB process. He felt he had family supports and was \nhoping to become a peer support specialist. \nPatient 3. This woman appeared to be approximately in her 20s. She had been in the Aid & Assist \nprocess for 50 days. She described waiting in jail for about one month, and that one day she was told \nshe would be going to OSH. She stated in the jail she was not given her medication. She said she felt \nโpushed aside.โ She was very complimentary of OSH. She liked the groups and the activities. She was \nexcited to be determined able to proceed but also aware she might be facing homelessness. \nPatient 4. This man was approximately in his 30s and in the A&A process. He described having been at \nOSH for about two (2) months and having waited in jail about two (2) months prior to his admission. He \nstated his parents provided many of his supports but he was looking for ways to not rely on them and \nwould need assistance with that. He described having manic and psychotic symptoms that needed \ninjectable medication for longterm stability. He stated he enjoyed doing drugs and wants to continue \nthat though was worried his mental health might worsen. He noted he had stopped his medication prior \nto arrest. He also stated there needed to homeless supports. He stated he was unable to afford bail \neven though his charges were fairly minor.   \nPatient 5. This man indicated he had been at OSH for three (3) months in the A&A process. He had \nwaited in jail for about a month. He had not been to OSH before, but had been in community mental \n10 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nhealth services. He noted the community services were โslim pickingsโ in his small county, they were \nshort-staffed and therefore services were difficult to access. Although he stated the system considered \nhim homeless, he stated he preferred โrough livingโ except for how people treat him like โless of a \nhumanโ as a result. He felt that he would likely therefore be recommended for a group home. And \nthough he preferred a different lifestyle, he also recognized he had a daughter to think about and \nwanted to get SSDI. He stated that confidence boosters help, and that his family could help. He felt peer \nsupport or community workers would not help him. He stated that he felt as a grown man that he is \ntreated like a 13-year old in the system. He thought the psychiatric and legal system needed an \noverhaul. \nPatient 6. This man appeared to be approximately in his 60s. He was well-read and brought in an article \nannouncing my appointment. He was in the GEI system, stating he had been in and out of the hospital \nmany times. He stated that one of his revocations involved use of oxycodone though it had been \nofficially medically prescribed after an accident. He noted homelessness and lack of access to crisis \nservices as some of the biggest barriers for him. He stated he was familiar with the CAHOOTS model (a \nnon-police crisis response model), and felt that law enforcement scares people who are having a mental \nhealth issue. He also stated housing is difficult to access due to stigma. He lived in his car for six months \nwhile working. He stated he felt guilty taking up a bed at OSH when others needed it. He was somewhat \nworried about how he would manage when he got to end of jurisdiction as he would continue to need \nsupports.  \nPatient 6 had an advocate with him who anonymously made observations that the PSRB makes \nconservative decisions thinking of โdoing timeโ as a โtreatmentโ, typically recommending PSRB \nsupervision for the maximum allotted times as a routine. He stated the hospital is just in the middle and \nnot able to help control their front or back door.  \nOHA Progress Reported in the January 3, 2022, Report to Neutral Expert \nThis progress report highlighted several areas of recent action by the state. First, OSH opened the first of \ntwo remaining Junction City units on 11/15/21, with one more slated to be opened 1/18/22 (of note this \nwas delayed, however until later in January due to COVID-19 and revising admissions strategy per the \nbelow recommendations). This created capacity, and lead to the movement of 24 GEI patients from the \nmain campus to the Junction City Campus.  Additionally, 24 A&A patients were able to be moved to a \nSRTF level of care on the OSH campus, allowing for 24 beds to be open at the hospital level of care. \nAdditionally, OSH opened 10 more admissions beds related to some COVID-19 unit re-adjustments. \nAdditionally, the state expanded criteria, now including patients whose most serious charge is a non-\nperson C felony, on the โReady-to-Place listโ when they no longer meet HLOC. \nOSH is meeting weekly with the Northwest Regional Reentry Center (NWRCC) and is attempting to work \nwith the home counties for those individuals on the โReady-to-Placeโ list. This has met with only limited \nsuccess, related at least in part to county resistance to using the NWRRC, according to OSH. \nThe Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) has been working with state courts to help support the \nprocesses outlined in Senate Bill 295 to increase the use of community-based restoration placements for \nthe A&A population committed to OSH. \n11 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nRegarding GEI patients, OHA has worked with the PSRB to facilitate discharge of GEI patients and reduce \ntheir length of stay once at OSH. The 1/3/22 progress report indicates that OHS/OSH and PSRB identify \nthose who could be referred for evaluation for community-based services. DOJ has participated in GEI \ncases where the court has not ordered community evaluations.  \nInformation from OJD \nState Court Administrator Nancy Cozine and her colleagues at OJD, along with several judges with whom \nI met, provided a wealth of information regarding their views of some of the barriers to compliance with \nregard to the A&A and GEI populations.  Because of their deep commitment to convening and \nstrengthening the overall system for individuals in the behavioral health and justice systems, in January \n2022, OJD hosted a two-day Oregon Behavioral Health Summit (with several exercises for stakeholders \nprior to the summit) to help gather feedback to identify a bill of rights for individuals in the behavioral \nhealth and justice system and identify gaps that could be addressed to improve outcomes. \nIn my meetings, I was provided preliminary recommendations from the Summit.  In their preliminary \nfindings report to me, they provided historical context of a phased plan with the first phase from a \nGAINS Community of Practice on Competence to Stand Trial/Competence Restoration, in which a \nworkgroup identified the following objectives embedded in an idea for regional behavioral health \nresource centers in its August 2020 strategic plan: \n \nโข  Divert individuals with behavioral health issues from the criminal justice system to services and \nsupports that reduce risk of reentry to the criminal justice system and emergency rooms \nโข  Expand availability of timely evaluations and community-based restoration services \nโข  Ensure geographic, racial, ethnic, and language equity of aid and assist services statewide \nโข  Make effective use of existing state and federal funds to deliver on systemwide goals and \naddress behavioral health needs (e.g., housing, treatment, transportation, etc.) \n \nOJD noted that since there were significant appropriations to OHA to enhance behavioral health crisis \nstabilization services and other features, the GAINS workgroup paused its meetings to observe the \nimplementation of new OHA initiatives.  \n \nBased on the Summitโs findings, gleaned from all the attendees, preliminary objectives for \nimprovements were described in the each of the following goal areas: Evaluations, Treatment and \nServices, Transition, Equity, Access, Coordination, and Data.  Their recommendations continue to be \ndistilled, and their will be a formal report from the Summit issued. \n \nTaken together, it is laudable that key personnel and judges working within OJD have been very invested \nin Aid & Assist issues for some time. An impressive database has been created for the court officials to \nbe able to track both systems and granular data related to particular cases and trends. There have also \nbeen several innovations, such as Judge Nan Wallerโs โrapid Aid & Assistโ evaluation effort and her \nconsolidated A&A docket. OJD personnel indicated that there had been a robust pretrial program that \nwas eliminated due to funding but that the courts were able to secure 40 pretrial coordinators now \nhired at local courts to help input data and track A&A cases.  \n \n12 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nThere are Behavioral Health Advisory Committees (BHAC) within OJD established at state and local \nlevels. The judges noted that there was also a similar meeting set by the legislature. With COVID-19, \nsome of the meeting duplication dissipated, but OJD continues to have regular meetings with a \nbehavioral health judicial consortium. They noted also that there had been a Behavioral Health Justice \nCounsel that included DRO, members of OJD and the behavioral health system.  \n \nThere was much discussion regarding the disconnect between criminogenic risks and needs that help \ndetermine security needed for public safety, and the clinical level of care determinations that involve \nmore secure placements. The OJD representatives commented on the frequency of homelessness and \nsubstance use disorders in the A&A populations, and a lack of ability to divert through civil processes \nwhile reducing recidivism. \n \nIn reviewing the OJD data dashboard, it was noted that of the A&A cases, 59% were ultimately found \nguilty (often via a plea, and some few were found GEI), and 33% were dismissed (some of whom were \ndetermined Never Able to proceed). Approximately 1% were dismissed pre-disposition.  It was noted in \ndiscussion that primary factors in dismissals involved: having a reasonable community plan, factoring in  \nthe duration of stay in a carceral setting, and consideration of whether probation might be an effective \noption.  \n \nOJD noted some barriers to data sharing including OHA concerns about HIPAA issues. They noted for \nexample that they do not have awareness of which of the individuals on their A&A caseloads are in OSH \nor other community placements.  \n \nThe OJD comments included that there can be confusion between overlapping roles of CMHPs, CCOs, \nand CCBHCs.  They noted in discussion with me that there are also frequent recommendations for level \n5 and 6 placements from clinical teams or evaluators, and that judges would not likely release to a lower \nlevel of care if that is the clinical recommendation. They described a desire to be more aware of bed \navailability in community settings to also know where the state might need more level 5 or 6 \nplacements. \n \nInformation from CJC \n \nI met with key leaders at CJC who were overseeing the IMPACTS grants. These grants were established \nto decrease recidivism and state hospital utilization and expand jail diversion. They indicated that in July \n2020 awards were made to 11 grantees across the state (five (5) tribes and six (6) counties) with $10M \nappropriated by the legislature. The grants run on a biennium cycle from 2020-2022 and there is the \npossibility of extension with an additional $10M appropriated at the end of the 2021 legislative session. \nDue to COVID-19 there have been delays in getting these initiatives off the ground.  The total allocations \nhave the potential to run through 2024. Data collected has been difficult to interpret due to the impact \nof COVID-19 on programs, but data is beginning to come in and will be analyzed as it does to help \nestablish the program successes and challenges. Preliminary reports on these grants were presented to \nthe legislature. For additional sites to be funded through this mechanism, there would need to be an \nadditional appropriation separate from the existing appropriations.   \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nSummary of Contextual Factors Considered in Recommendations \n \nHospital Context \n \nOSH is a state-run facility with an active capacity of 706 beds (though it is licensed for 743, there is an \noperational need to manage beds at the active capacity) (See Table 1). There has been recent expansion \non the Junction City Campus, and Table 1 reflects accurate data projected for the week of 1/31/22. \nWithout getting into too many details about the hospital specifics, it is important to highlight four main \ncontextual factors facing OSH that have emerged as themes from my meetings relevant to timely \nadmissions of A&A and GEI populations. I will outline them here. \n \n1)  OSH, like institutions throughout the world, has been facing clinical dilemmas related to COVID-19. \nThe hospital administration has explained to me their protocols that follow specific guidelines aimed \nat reducing the spread of the virus, and, when necessary, managing those who do get COVID-19 \nsafely. To date the hospital has done a very good job with this.  The leadership reported to me that \nno patient at OSH has had serious medical sequelae and there have been no deaths associated with \nCOVID-19 among patients. That said, to do so they have had to make some very difficult decisions, \nincluding a decision to pause admissions periodically. When admissions are paused, the waitlist \nnumbers increase, making these administrative and clinical decisions so complex. With the evolving \nCOVID-19 situation, this balance will undoubtedly continue to need to be deliberated in the best \ninterests of individuals waiting in jails for admission and those at the hospital.  \n \nIn 2022 Dates of Paused Admissions to OSH due to COVID-19 included: \n1)  January 4 through January 11 \n2)  January 17 through January 21 \n  \n2)  Staffing shortages have reached at times critical levels. The hospital has called upon the National \nGuard to assist, and per their discussion with me that has helped alleviate some of the strain with \nthe National Guard members assigned to duties within their skillset. Staffing shortages of the \nlicensed professional staff and the non-licensed staff remain, and as such the hospital has conducted \na staffing gap analysis and presented staffing requests in the hopes of a fiscal appropriation and an \nadministrative allowance to expand FTEs. Timely admissions and safe discharges depend on \nsufficient staff. \n \n3)  Increased referrals create more demand.  Data trends show ever increasing Aid and Assist \nevaluation orders (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Compared to prior years, even โslowโ months with \nfewer referrals show higher numbers of referrals than the busiest months in years past.  This pace of \nreferrals creates an impossible dilemma for OSH. Forensic evaluators at FES are increasingly called in \nto do first evaluations, and there seem to be increasing numbers of second opinion evaluations, also \ncreating delay- and statistically in terms of ultimate findings, it is not clear whether this creates any \nmeaningful change in ultimate adjudication for many defendants, besides longer wait times. \n \n4)  Delayed discharges reduce the ability to timely admit new patients. Data reports (see Table 3 above) \nindicate that there is a growing โDischarge Pending Placementโ waitlist.  Reports from staff at OSH \nand OHA indicate that even with the enactment of SB 295, it is not always followed and little \ntraction has been made on many cases of individuals who do not require a hospital level of care per \nclinical determinations. This creates other Olmstead issues with regard to not placing indivduals in a \n14 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nless restrictive level of care when clinically appropriate. Because of the many fingers in the discharge \nprocess, including the individual themselves whose discharge relates to County actors, local actors, \nState actors, Courts, CCOs, CMHPs, and others, it is a challenging process under the best of \ncircumstances. That said, as reported by nearly every group with whom I spoke there are barriers at \nthe county and community levels that warrant further scrutiny and attention in order to achieve \ncompliance with admissions. \n \nCommunity Context \n \nThe community context also has several complexities that have emerged as themes in my meetings. \nSome notable contextual factors that are important to note with regard to compliance include the \nfollowing: \n \n1.  The impact of COVID-19 has completely shifted community services, and created fraying of an \nalready fragile workforce.  As noted by Director Allen in his 11/17/21 report to the legislature, there \nhas been an unprecedented set of challenges to community systems, who daily struggle to maintain \nstaffing levels of direct service providers at the ground level, and stay afloat financially. Although \nresources are being allocated in generous amounts through recent appropriations, pouring money \ninto a frayed system will not be an immediate remedy. Moreover, the dollars must be distributed in \na way that also shows accountability to taxpayers, and this additional scrutiny puts pressure on \ncommunity systems to perform better, at a time when many are simply trying to survive. \n \n2.  Justice-involved behavioral health populations present unique challenges. As is seen in countless \nstudies, it is clear that there are many factors that make criminal recidivism for individuals with \nserious mental illness--and especially those with co-occurring substance use disorders and those \nwith homelessnessโdifficult to tackle. The population of persons in the Aid & Assist and GEI \nsystems quite often have those complexities. Studies show that most often their repeated criminal \nconduct involves lower-level offenses. Nevertheless disrupting the cycle of arrest, incarceration and \nrehospitalization requires more intensive and intentional service components to address their \ncomplex needs. It was reported by people I spoke with that community providers often feel ill-\nequipped and under-resourced to work across the behavioral health and justice system to help \nbreak these negative cycles for persons served. Furthermore, justice system partners such as \nprobation and parole can play a role in reducing recidivism, which is outside the behavioral health \nsystemโs purview. Even with additional financial resources, the community systems may need \nadditional support and training to best serve these populations. \n \n3.  Substance use disorders commonly co-occur with mental illness for those in the Aid & Assist and GEI \nprocess. Community behavioral health leadership and the judges with whom I spoke raised a \nnumber of concerns about how to best address substance use disorders among the Aid & Assist \npopulation in particular, and especially with regard to the nature of methamphetamine use and its \nrelationship to psychosis and paranoia.  These symptoms can often lead an individual to appear unfit \nto proceed during acute phases of use, and the forensic evaluators described how this can impact \ntheir forensic evaluations. With the passage of Measure 110, there is movement afoot through OHA \nto help shore up treatment resources for individuals with substance use disorders, though this again \nis not an overnight solution. At the same time, individuals in the Aid & Assist and GEI processes have \nnot traditionally been part of the โsubstance use treatment systems.โ There has been and will \n15 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \ncontinue to be discussion regarding how and whether this factors into compliance with timely \nadmissions. \n \n4.  The structure of the community services is complex, and there can be silos between counties and \nstate responsibilities, leaving the state unable to shift policy and practice without county support. \nAlso managed care entities responsible for providing care or overseeing care delivery for \nbeneficiaries have their own metrics and incentives. Periods of detention/incarceration can disrupt \ncontinuity of care for individuals adding to the challenges of providers. Within Oregon the CCOs and \nthe CMHPs as well as the counties and municipalities themselves are not as directly impacted by the \ncompliance demands and they may have different priorities that can even contradict addressing  \nbarriers to timely admission and discharge of individuals in these forensic processes. According to \nobservations from the parties, the SB 295 legislation was designed to address some of the \nchallenges in part, but it is at times misunderstood or appears to not be consistently followed. \nRecommendations below attempt to begin addressing some of these issues.  \nUnique population needs \nFor this report and recommendations, specific information was not gathered regarding how many \nindividuals in the A&A or GEI systems represented populations in need of specialized services within \nOHA and across other agencies. These include individuals with individuals with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disability services, neurocognitive conditions (i.e., the so-called dementias), traumatic \nbrain injury or primary substance use disorders. In addition, this report did not focus on veterans or \npersons with a history of military service who may have access to additional housing or other supports. \nThese special populations may be relevant for focus in future recommendations pertaining to \ncompliance issues.  \nRecommendations: \nAs noted above, Judge Mosman ordered the neutral expert to make recommendations to: 1) address \ncapacity issues at the Oregon State Hospital; and 2) include a suggested admissions protocol that \naddresses the admission of patients found unable to aid and assist in their own defense under ORS \n161.370 (.370 patients).  The following represent my recommendations, which have been agreed to by \nthe parties: \nRegarding addressing capacity issues at OSH, I recommend that OHA take the following actions:  \n1.  Pursue avenues to expedite and improve discharge processes, including but not limited to: \na.  Advocacy for legislation that would require county fiscal responsibility for individuals in OSH \nwho do not require that level of care \nb.  Development of methods to enhance SB 295 processes \nc.  Refinement of discharge policies/protocols utilizing discharge practices that have been \nshown to be effective \n \n2.  Continue to examine community barriers to preventing unnecessary admissions and diverting \nindividuals from admission and from HLOC when those levels of care or placements are not \nclinically appropriate, maximizing the utilization of hospital beds for those in need of a hospital \nto support their recovery \n16 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \n3.  Consider evaluation order trends and determine if there are areas that can be addressed to gain \nefficiencies and reduce wait times that may impact compliance \n4.  Advocate for the adoption of the OSH staffing request  \n5.  Regularly continue to meet with Plaintiffs and Neutral Expert \n6.  Regularly meet, along with plaintiffs, with leadership from OJD including at least State Court \nAdministrator Nancy Cozine and one judge to inform discussion that can lead to progress vis a \nvis compliance (State Court Administrator Cozine and Judge Nan Waller have agreed to this \nrecommendation).  \nRegarding an admissions protocol, I recommend the following:   \n1.  Coordinate admissions lists between GEI patients and A&A patients to reduce overall jail times \nof both groups. \n2.  Utilize the opening of the additional Junction City unit to facilitate admission of patients into \nOSH, including GEI patients to equalize waitlist times to create the ability for a more uniform \nadmissions protocol.  \n3.  Develop data infrastructure improvements to help monitor compliance and tracking through a \ndata dashboard to be shared across entities and to further develop admissions strategies and \nhospital capacity by tracking data in a consistent manner. Data elements should include but not \nbe limited to: \na.  Admissions Data: Number of individuals currently awaiting admission from jail by legal \nstatus (GEI/A&A), average time individuals are waiting (including range), average times \nindividuals who were admitted waited for admission by month, performance metric \nmeasuring trends in wait times. These elements should be  able to be viewed at a state \nlevel, and broken down by county. Establishment of additional metrics for these same \ndata elements sorted by severity of charges and whether individuals represent unique \npopulations (persons with mental illness or intellectual/developmental disabilities, for \nexample) may be added to the dashboard if feasible over time. Additional data elements \nshould be further discussed by the parties with consultation from the neutral expert. \n \nb.  Discharge/Ready to Place Data: Ready to Place data should include number of \nindividuals ready to place, level of care needed, and days identified as no longer needing \nOSH services but still awaiting placement in an alternative setting. This data should be \nable to be tracked over time. This information should be available at a state level and by \ncounty. Establishment of additional metrics for these same data elements sorted by \nseverity of charges and whether individuals represent unique populations (persons with \nmental illness or intellectual/developmental disabilities, for example) may be added to \nthe dashboard if feasible over time. Additional data elements should be further \ndiscussed by the parties with consultation from the neutral expert. \nI have discussed the principles embedded within each of the above recommendations with the \nparties, and they have indicated agreement with them. Also of note, coordinating and executing the \nadmissions between GEI and A&A individuals into OSH with the goal of using the Junction City new \nunit already began prior to this report, and the total wait times of GEIs was significantly reduced. \nDue to COVID-19-related pauses in admissions, the waitlist for individuals on A&A increased, but this \nwill continue to be tracked now that admissions are no longer on pause.  \n17 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nIn order to develop action items related to these first short-term recommendations, I also suggested \nthat the parties jointly develop steps that could be taken along similar domains, including data, \npolicy/protocol, legislative and any other dimension to address capacity issues at OSH and move \ntoward compliance. The parties worked diligently to accomplish that request.  Their jointly \nconstructed short-term action items are in line with my recommendations and I therefore \nrecommend that they be pursued to help move toward compliance. I applaud the efforts of the \nparties in developing them.  \nShort-Term Action Items as Agreed Upon by the Parties (and Supported by the Neutral Expert) \nA.  Data Improvements \n \n1.  Data dashboard.  By March 1, 2022, the parties, with input of the neutral expert, will \ndevelop a data-dashboard with agreed-upon elements to show progress in reaching \ncompliance and a plan for implementation, including a reporting cadence and \ndistribution list.  Anticipated distribution of this data would be by April 1. \nOHA will review whether additional staff are required to support this effort in a \nsustained capacity and, if so, bring that request to the legislature.  DRO/MPD will \nactively support that request if made.    \nB.  Policy/Protocol Actions \n \n1.  Use of the Junction City units. In accordance with the Neutral Expert preliminary \nrecommendations and with the agreement of the parties, OSH will prioritize admissions \nof GEI patients to its Salem campus for assessment and placement, so that the GEI and \nA&A populations to be admitted from jail are waiting about the same length of time. For \nCOVID-19 safety and protocols as well as overall speed of admission, at the time of this \nreport, people are only admitted to the Salem campus, where the admissions \nmonitoring units and staff are centralized. After the admission process is complete to \nOSH, OSH will assess for appropriate movement to Junction City placements based on all \nappropriate clinical and patient safety considerations, thereby opening up subsequent \nadditional beds for admission on the admissions unit.    \n \n2.  Discharge processes.  By March 1, 2022, OSH Social Work Department in coordination \nwith OHA Office of Behavioral Health will review internal discharge processes for all \ncommitment types with the intent to streamline multiple processes that have shown \nbeneficial outcomes into one process with nuance between legal status clearly defined.  \nThe results of this review will be presented in MOOVRS on March 3, 2022, and will be \nshown to the neutral expert and the parties with the goal of implementation of new \nprotocol by March 14. Progress on this will be summarized in the March 3, 2022, \nprogress report to Dr. Pinals.   \n \n3.  Reduction in hospital admissions for individuals that can appropriately be served in other \nsettings.  In its February 3, 2022, progress report to Dr. Pinals, OHA will describe what it \n18 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \nis currently doing to prevent or reduce the growth of hospital admissions of individuals \nwho can be clinically served in a less medically intensive level of care (particularly aid \nand assist patients). \n \n4.  Supports in the community.  In its February 3, 2022, progress report to Dr. Pinals, OHA \nwill describe the ways in which it has identified and funded additional supports in the \ncommunity for people who are restored to competency, which will generate ongoing \ndiscussion with the parties regarding impacts on compliance. \n \nC.  Legislative Actions \n \n1.  County financial risk sharing.  OHA has proposed legislation that would allow charging \ncounties for patients who no longer require hospital level of care on the OSH 9b list \nbeyond a date threshold.  DRO will support this legislative effort and/or engage with \nstakeholders in developing an alternative that promotes enhanced county engagement \nand accountability in supporting timely transitions to community.    \n \n2.  OSH staffing.  OSH has submitted a request to the legislature for increased position \nauthority and funding.  DRO will actively support this legislative request.  \n \n3.  Other legislative actions.  In its February 3, 2022 report to Dr. Pinals, OHA will further \ndescribe any additional relevant legislation it has proposed that may impact compliance.  \nDRO/MPD will support OHAโs legislative requests as appropriate. \n \nD.  Court Case Specific Actions \n \nFocus on maximizing adherence to SB 295. Adherence to SB 295 (law providing for discharge of \n.370 patients who no longer require HLOC) is critical to make room for new admissions to OSH \nand to have individuals who no longer need hospital level institutional care placed in a less \nrestrictive setting. According to tracking by the State, some state courts and CMHPs are not \nfollowing this law as it is written, which results in .370 patients on the Ready to Place List staying \nat OSH for longer than necessary or allowed by law.  To support adherence to SB 295, the \nparties will do the following: \n \n1.  Education. DOJ/OHA, DRO, and MPD will develop a one-hour CLE on SB 295 for defense \nlawyers.  They will coordinate with the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association for \na virtual presentation in the near future. The parties will continue to work together and \nconsult with OJD to determine whether a similar presentation for OJD and prosecutors \nwould also be beneficial. \n \n2.  Informal support. General counsel for OSH will continue already ongoing efforts to \nsupport compliance through targeted communications with individual defense lawyers \nand prosecutors. MPD will now also make themselves available to try and intervene \nwith defense lawyers to ensure they follow SB 295.  \n19 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n1/30/22 \n          \n \n \n3.  Advocacy.  DOJ will evaluate cases on a state-wide basis for direct legal intervention on \nbehalf of OSH where they determine that SB 295 is not being followed by state courts or \nCMHPs.  DRO will develop, and revise as needed, an amicus brief that it will file such \ncases where appropriate. DOJ will notify DRO about the OSH intervention and will \nprovide information needed for DRO to evaluate whether to submit such an amicus \nbrief. \n \n4.  Tracking: OSH will evaluate the impact on bed space of measures taken under this \nsection to reduce discharge wait times, and report to Dr. Pinals and DRO in currently-\nscheduled regular meetings. \n \nConcluding Comments  \nThis matter has involved a good faith effort to develop recommendations that are aimed primarily to \nreduce wait times to access OSH services when appropriate for individuals within the Aid and Assist and \nGEI context. These recommendations are preliminary, and several additional items were considered and \nthought to be more appropriate for longer-term recommendations as they will require further \ndeliberation and prioritization determinations.   \nThat these initial recommendations were developed collaboratively with the potential to leverage the \nstrengths and roles of each side of the litigation has been critical. I note that in my meetings with them, \nit has appeared that both parties are committed to and rooted in the values of ensuring that individuals \nin A&A and GEI processes receive timely and appropriate care and treatment, and eliminating barriers to \nachieving those goals.  \nI appreciate the help of the leadership and staff at OSH, OHA, DRO, CJC, and OJD in offering their \nthoughts to support the compilation of this first report. I also am grateful especially to Mr. Cody Gabel \nwho assisted me in better understanding the Oregon behavioral health and justice system while \ncoordinating meetings and tracking information I requested to inform these recommendations.  \n \nRespectfully Submitted by: \n \nDebra A. Pinals, M.D. \nClinical Professor of Psychiatry \nDirector, Program in Law, Psychiatry, and Ethics \nUniversity of Michigan \n20 \n ",

Defendants also move for clarification and modification of the injunction.  I deny \nthe motions. \n1- ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 65    Filed 05/28/02    Page 2 of 4\nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs brought this action on behalf of criminal defendants who have been determined \nby the Circuit Courts within Oregon to be unfit to proceed to trial and in need of hospitalization \nbecause they suffer from mental incapacities.  After a trial on the merits, this court concluded the \nindefinite imprisonment of persons deemed unfit to proceed and in need of treatment is unjust, and \nthat there is no rationalization that passes constitutional muster for unreasonably detaining such \npersons in county jails and depriving them of hospitalization.  This court further concluded the \ntreatment received by persons found unfit to proceed while incarcerated instead of hospitalized is \nconstitutionally inadequate, and that such persons must be transferred as soon as practicable to a \ntreatment facility, and should be detained only for that period of time necessary to identify the \nperson, determine the appropriate legal status, and effectuate transport.  I ordered admissions to \nbe done in a reasonably timely manner, and completed not later than seven days after the issuance \nof an order determining a criminal defendant to be unfit to proceed to trial because of mental \nincapacities under ORS ยง 161.370(2). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Motion to Stay \nDefendants move to stay enforcement of this ruling pending their appeal.  The motion is \nbrought under Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits this court to \n\"suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction\" during the pendency of an appeal \"upon such \nterms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse \nparty.\"  \"This Rule grants the district court no broader power than it has always inherently \n2- ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 65    Filed 05/28/02    Page 3 of 4\npossessed to preserve the status quo during the pendency of an appeal .... \" Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc. v. Southwest Marine Inc., 242 F.3d 1163, 1166 (91h Cir. 2001). \nPlaintiffs and defendants rely upon the same authority for determining the standards \nemployed to evaluate a motion to stay a civil judgment.  In Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987), the Supreme Court identified the factors regulating the issuance of a stay:  (1) \nwhether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that the applicant is likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of \nthe stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4  ) determining \nwhere the public interest lies. \nI conclude that defendants have failed to make a strong showing that their appeal is likely \nto succeed on the merits or that they will be irreparably injured absent a stay.  Moreover, a stay \nwould substantially injure other parties,  specifically, those persons who have been identified by \nstate courts as being in need of hospitalization and yet are nevertheless being deprived of \nadmission and treatment.  The public interest favors denial of a stay.  Accordingly, I deny \ndefendants' motion for a stay. \nII. Motion for Clarification \nDefendants also move for clarification and modification of this court's previous ruling. \nDefendants request an interpretation of the court's ruling that the admission of a person \ndetermined to be unfit to proceed be completed \"not later than seven days after the issuance\" of \nthe order finding the person unfit to proceed.  Defendants ask that the \"seven days\" be calculated \nfrom the date the Oregon State Hospital receives a copy of the court order, rather than from the \ndate the court issues the ruling. \n3- ORDER \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 65    Filed 05/28/02    Page 4 of 4\nPlaintiffs oppose this proposed interpretation, arguing defendants' desire for administrative \nconvenience should not trump the needs and rights of the persons requiring hospitalization.  I \nagree.  Defendants' motion for clarification and modification is denied.  The hospitalization of \npersons determined to be unfit to proceed shall be completed not later than seven days after the \nissuance of the order finding the person unfit to proceed, as previously ordered by this court. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants' motions to stay (#49) and for modification and clarification (#58) are \nDENIED. \nDATED this Eday of May, 2002. \na~~d~ \nOwen l-tParmer \nUnited States District Court Judge \n4- ORDER ",

I award plaintiffs $53,062.50 in fees and $600.86 in costs.  \nBACKGROUND\n1 - ORDER\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 77    Filed 05/29/03    Page 2 of 4\nPlaintiffs were represented by Kathleen L. Wilde, an attorney with almost 25 years' of\nexperience, mainly in litigating federal civil rights actions.  This case was tried on an accelerated\nschedule, with the court trial held only about three weeks after the complaint was filed.   The expedited\nschedule required intense preparation.  Defendants contested the case vigorously.  \nAt trial, plaintiffs won essentially all the relief they sought, a declaration that criminal defendants\nwho are unfit to proceed must receive prompt mental health treatment in a facility able to provide such\ncare.   The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2003). \nSTANDARDS \nTo determine a reasonable attorney's fee, the court should first calculate the lodestar amount,\nwhich is the number of hours reasonably spent on the litigation multiplied by reasonable hourly rates. \nMcGrath v. County of Nevada, 67 F.3d 248, 252 (9th Cir. 1995).  The court must exclude hours that\nwere not reasonably expended.  Id.  The party seeking fees has the burden of showing that the time\nspent was reasonably necessary to the successful prosecution of the party's claims.  Frank Music Corp.\nv. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 886 F.2d 1545, 1557 (9th Cir. 1989).\nAfter calculating the lodestar amount, the court should then \"assess whether the presumptively\nreasonable lodestar figure should be adjusted on the basis of Kerr factors not already subsumed in the\ninitial calculation.\"  McGrath, 67 F.3d at 252 (citing Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70\n(9th Cir. 1975)1).  The lodestar amount is presumptively reasonable, and the court may use a multiplier\n1The Kerr factors are:  (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the\nissues; (3) the skill required; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney; (5) the customary\n2 - ORDER\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 77    Filed 05/29/03    Page 3 of 4\nto increase or decrease the lodestar amount only in \"'rare' and 'exceptional' cases, supported by both\n'specific evidence' on the record and detailed findings\" that the lodestar amount is unreasonably low or\nhigh.  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 565 (1986)\n(citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 898-901 (1984)).  \nA district court has considerable discretion in determining a reasonable fee award.  Webb v.\nAda County, 195 F.3d 524, 527 (9th Cir. 1999).  Even when the opposing party does not make\nspecific objections, the court has an independent duty to determine whether a fee request is reasonable. \nGates v. Deukmejian, 987 F.2d 1392, 1401 (9th Cir. 1992). \nDISCUSSION\nI.  Number of Hours\nPlaintiffs seek 235.83 hours.  Defendants do not object to the number of hours.  \nI have evaluated plaintiffs' time records and find that the time spent was reasonable in light of\nthe expedited schedule, the fairly novel legal issues, and the contested nature of the litigation.  I note that\nWilde deducted about 70 hours from the fee petition as a matter of billing judgment.  \nII.  Hourly Rate\nfee; (6) the contingent or fixed nature of the fee; (7) the time limits imposed by the client or\ncircumstances; (8) the amount involved and result obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability\nof the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the case; (11) the nature and length of the attorney's\nprofessional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.  Kerr, 526 F.2d at 70. \nSeveral Kerr factors are subsumed in the lodestar calculation, including the novelty and complexity of\nthe issues, the special skill and experience of counsel, the quality of the representation, the results\nobtained, and the contingency of the fee.  Morales v. City of San Rafael, 96 F.3d 359, 363-64 & n.9\n(9th Cir. 1996), amended on other grounds, 108 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 1997).  The subsumed factors\n\"may not act as independent bases for adjustment of the lodestar.\"  Cunningham v. County of Los\nAngeles, 879 F.2d 481, 487 (9th Cir. 1989). \n3 - ORDER\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-PA    Document 77    Filed 05/29/03    Page 4 of 4\nPlaintiffs seek an hourly rate of $225 for Wilde.  Defendants do not object to the requested\nrate.  \nHere, plaintiffs have submitted affidavits from local attorneys in support of the requested hourly\nrate.  I find that $225 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate for a Portland attorney with Wilde's skill,\nreputation, and experience.     \nI conclude that the lodestar amount is $53,062.50, based on 235.83 hours at $225 per hour. \nThere is no reason to adjust the lodestar amount based on any of the Kerr factors.  \nDefendants do not object to plaintiCffOs' NreCquLeUstSedIO coNs t s.  I find that the costs are reasonable.  \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Award of Fees (#52)  is granted and plaintiffs are awarded $53,062.50 in\nattorney's fees and $600.86 in costs. \nDATED this 29th  day of May, 2003.\n                                      /s/ Ow en M.

The  United  States  District \nCourt  for  the  District  of  Oregon,  Qwen  M.  Fanner,  J.,  entered  an  injunction \nrequiring  the  hospital  to  admit  criminal  defendants  within  seven  days  of  a \ntrial  court's  finding  of  their  incapacity  to  proceed  to  trial,  and  officials \nappealed.  The  Court  of  Appeals,  Fisher,  Circuit  Judge,  held  that:  (1) \nconstituents  of  federally  authorized  and  funded  law  office  establisned  under \nthe  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Mentally  lll  Individuals  Act  of  1986  (PAMI) \nwere  the  functional  equivalent  of  members,  for  purposes  of  offices \nassociational  standing;  (2)  other  requirements  for  associational  standing \nwere  met;  (3)  uncer  Oregon  law,  it  is  state  mental  hospital,  not  counties, \nthat  has  the  duty  to  accept  mentally  incapacitated  defendants  for  evaluation \nand  treatment,  once  they  have  been  certified  as  such  by  a  circuit  court;  (4) \naction  was  not  moot;  (5)  hospital's  delay  in  admitting  incapacitated \ndefendants  violated  their  substantive  due  process  rights;  (6)  deliberate \nindifference  did  not  have  to  be  established  before  state  hospital  could  be \nheld  liable  for  such  violations;  (7)  violations  were  sufficient  to  support  the \ninjunction;  and  (8)  the  district  court  did  not  violate  the  Eleventh  Amendment \nin  concluding  that  the  hospital  had,  in  the  past,  violated  the  due  process. \nAffirmed. \nopinion \nFISHER,  Circuit  Judge.\nOregon,  in  recognition  of  the  constitutional  rights  of  mentally  incapacitated \npersons  chargec  with  a  crime,  commendably  has  enacted  statutory \nprocedures  for  the  identification  and  restorative  treatment  of  such  persons \nso  that  their  guilt  or  innocence  can  be  determined  in  a  trial.  This  case \npresents  the  question  of  what  happens  when  the  state  mental  hospital \n(Oregon  State  Hospital  or  โOSH\"),  which  is  charged  with  evaluating  and \ntreating  mentally  incapacitated  defendants,  refuses  to  accept  such \ndefendants  on  a  timely  basis.  Plaintiffs  contend  that  OSHโ's  delays  in \naccepting  mentally  incapacitated  defendants  violate  those  defendantsโ \nsubstantive  and  procedural  due  process  rights.  OSH  argues  that  it  is  the \ncounty  jailsโ  responsibility  to  maintain  and  treat  incapacitated  defendants \nuntil  OSH  has  an  open  bed.  After  a  bench  trial,  the  district  court  agreed \nwith  the  plaintiffs  and  entered  an  injunction  requiring  OSH  to  admit \ndefendants  within  seven  days  of  a  trial  court's 3 meng  of  their incapacity  to \nproceed  to  trial.  We  have  jurisdiction  under2 8  U.S.C.  ยง  1297,  and  we \naffirm. \nBACKGROUND \n|.  Parties \nPlaintiffs  (appellees  here)  include  A.J.  Madison,  a  mentally  incapacitated \ncriminal  defendant  who  was  detained  in  a  county  jail  while  awaiting  transfer \nto  OSH,  and  two  nonprofit  organizations  that  represent  such  defendants. \nPlaintiff  Oregon  Advocacy  Center  OAC\")  is  a  federally  authorized  and \nfunded  law  office  established  uncer  the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for \nMentally  ll  Individuals  Act  of  1986  CPAMII\"), 42 U.S.C,  ยงยง 7OS01-โ10857 \nOAC  represents  the  rights  of  people  with  disabilities,  including mentally  fi  \nindividuals.  Plaintiff  Madison  is  one  of  OAC's  constituents  and  requested \nthat  OAC  bring  this  suit  on  his  behalf.  Plaintiff  Metropolitan  Public  Defender \nServices,  Inc.  (MPD\")  represents  indigent  criminal  defendants  in  two \nOregon  counties. \nThese  plaintiffs  sued  Stanley  MazurโHart,  the  Superintendent  of  the \nOregon  State  Hospital,  and  Bobby  Mink,  the  Director  of  Oregon's \nDepartment  of  Human  Services,  in  their  official  capacities  (collectively \nreferred  to  as  โOSHโ  in  this  opinion).  The  plaintiffs  alleged  that  OSH  was \nviolating  mentally  incapacitated  defendantsโ  due  process  rights  by \nunreasonably  delaying  such  defendantsโ  transfer  from  county  jails  to  OSH \nfor  treatment. \nli.  The  Problem \nUnder  Oregon  law,  state  circuit  (irial)  courts  may,  before  or  during  trial,  find \na  criminal  defendant  to  be  incapacitated  as  a  result  of  a  mental  disease  or \ndefect  such  that  the  defendant  is  unable  to  assist  and  cooperate  with\ndefense  counsel  or  participate  in  the  defense.โ  Such  a  finding  triggers \nโ#708  a  process  designed  to  evaluate,  treat  and  restore  the  defendant's \nmental  health  so  that  judicial  proceedings  may  resume.  โIf  [a]  court \ndetermines  that  [a  criminal]  defendant  lacks  fitness  to  proceed  [to  trial],  the \nproceeding  against  the  defendant  shall  be  suspended  ...  and  the  court  shall \ncommit  the  defendant  to  the  custody  of  the  superintendent  of  a  state \nmental  nospital designateโ by  the  Department  of  Human  Services... \nGregon  Revised  Statute  CORS\") ยง  187.4702). The  Oregon  State  Hospital \nis  the  only  ยฐ state  mental  hospitalโ  that  has  been  designated  under  this \nstatute. \nOSH  is  required  to  evaluate  a  defendant  committed  to  its  custody  within  60 \ndays  of  the  defendant's  arrival  to  determine  โwhether  there  is  a  substantial \nprobability  that,  in  the  foreseeable future,  the  defendant  will  have  the \ncapacity  to  stand  trial.โ  ORS  ยง  161.3703)  (emphasis  added).  If,  at  any \ntime,  the  defendant  becomes  capable of standing  trial  or  will  never  have \nthat  capacity,  OSH  must  immediately  so  notify  the  court.  ORS  ยง \nTH1.3  }.  Within  90  days  of  the  cefendant's  arrival,  OSH  must  notify  the \ncourt whether  the  defendant  has  the  capacity  to  stand  trial  and,  if  not, \nwhether  there  is  a  substantial  probability  that  the  defendant  will  gain  or \nregain  that  capacity  in  the  foreseeable  future.  /d.  lf  OSH  determines  that \nsuch  a  probability  exists,  โthe  defendant  shall  remain  in  [OSH's]  custody \nwhere  the  defendant  shall  receive  treatment  designed for  the Purpose  of \nenabling  the  defendant  to  gain  or  regain  capacity.โ  ORS  ยง  167.3705} \nAfter  a  bench  trial,  the  district  court  found  that,  during  2007  and  early  2002, \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  spent  on  average  about  one  month  in \ncounty  jails  before  OSH  accepted  them  for  the  requisite  evaluation  and \ntreatment.  In  many  cases,  defendants  had  to  wait  two,  three  or  even  five \nmonths.  The  court  also  spelled  out  in  a  series  of  factual  findingsโfor  the \nmost  part  undisputed  by  OSHโthe  harms  suffered  by  defendants  who  are \nrelegated  to  a  wait-list  status  and  remain  in  jail  until  OSH  has  room  for \nthem.  We  set  out  the  most  relevant  undisputed  findings  here: \n9.  Jails  can  provide  medication  management  for  people  who  are  willing  to \ntake  medications,  but  cannot  administer  medication  involuntarily,  except  in \na  life-threatening  emergency.  When  resources  permit,  treatment  for  โunfit  to \nproceecโ  defendants  may  possibly  include  basic  clinical  psychiatry  and \nintervention.  Such  treatment  is  designed  to  stabilize  the  inmate.  However, \nsome  inmates,  particularly  those  with  personality  disorders,  refuse  or  do \nnot  respond  to  mecication,  and  do  not  otherwise  respond  to  the  treatment \nthe  jails  can  provide. \n10.  None  of  the  jails  in  which  these  persons  are  held  is  able  to  provide\ntreatment  designed  to  restore  a  person  found  unfit  to  proceed  to \ncompetency.  People  found  unfit  to  proceed  are  often  overtly  psychotic  and \nrequire  special  housing  or  segregation.  They  are  unpredictable  and \ndisruptive,  taking  up  valuable  resources  needed  for  the  care  of  other  โS7OF \ninmates.  If  they  refuse  to  take  medications,  they  often  decompensate \nrapidly.  They  often  are  confined  in  their  cells  for  22  to  23  hours  a  day \nbecause  of  their  behavior.  This  exacerbates  their  mental  illness. \n11.  Necessarily,  the  jailsโ  only  system  for  controlling  inmates  is  disciplinary, \nwhich  is  behavior-driven.  Such  a  system  is  ineffective  for  mentally  ill \npersons,  and  possibly  harmful. \n12.  Unlike  the  county  jails,  OSH  has  the  capacity  to  treat  a  person's  mental \niliness.  Each  of  the  units  housing  persons  found  unfit  to  proceed  is  staffed \nby  a  full-time  psychiatrist,  a  psychologist,  a  mental  health  specialist,  a \nrecreation  counselor,  a  social  worker,  a  mental  health  technician  and \nnurses. \n13.  In  addition  to  assessment,  medication  evaluation  and  management, \nand  individual  and  group  psychotherapy,  OSH  provides  legal  skills  training \nthree  times  a  week  to  assist  patients  in  learning  about  the  law,  pleas,  and \nreturning  to  court.  This  treatment  is  designed  to  enable  a  person  to  regain \nfitness  to  proceed  to  trial. \n17.  ....  This  population  has  a  high  suicide  risk,  and  osychasis  can  be  an \nemergency  requiring  immediate  treatment. \n18.  ....  Depriving  [persons  deemed  unfit  to  proceed]  of  necessary  medical \ntreatment  increases  the  likelihood  that  they  may  decompensate  and  suffer \nunduly.  The  delays  also  hamper  efforts  to  provide  effective  representation \nregarding  their  criminal  prosecution. \n19.  ....  [Als  the  cllent  spends  weeks  and  months  in  jail  awaiting \nhospitalization,  thie]  evaluation  [required  by  state  law]  is  delayed....[Fjor \npeople  declared  to  be  unable  to  aid  and  assist,  delays  in  the  subsequent \nevaluative  process  can  postpone  the  opportunity  for  a  trial  for  much  longer \nthan  60  days. \n20.  The  jails  have  the  capacity  to  transport  inmates  to  a  treatment  facility \nwithin  24  hours.  The  reason  they  do  not  transport  the  inmates  is  because \ndefendants  refuse  to  accept  them. \nHl.  The  Suit \nPlaintiffs  sued  OSH  on  March  19,  2002,  seeking  injunctive  and  declaratory \nrelief.  OAC  and  MPD  both  brought  suit  on  behalf  of  constituents  who  suffer \ninjury  as  a  result  of  OSH's  failure  to  provide  them  timely  treatment.  MPD \nalso  sued  in  its  own  right.  As  of  the  date  of  filing,  there  were  seven \npersons,  including  Madison,  who  had  been  deciared  unfit  and  who  were\nbeing  held  in  county  jails  awaiting  transfer  to  OSH.  As  of  March  25,  2002, \nthere  were  11  such  persons  including  Madison.  Madison  was  held  in  jail  for \na  total  of  23  days  before  being  admitted  to  OSH  on  March  28,  2002. \nThe  district  court  held  a  bench  trial  on  April  8,  2002,  and  issued  its  findings \nof  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  on  May  9.  It  heid  that  (1)  OAC  had  standing \nto  sue  on  behalf  of  its  constituents,  mentally  incapacitated  criminal \ndefendants,  and  MPD  had  standing  to  sue  in  its  own  right;  and  (2)  OSH \nwas  violating  the  incapacitated  defendanisโ  Fourteenth  Amendment  due \nprocess  rights  by  unreasonably  detaining  them  in  county  jails  that  lack  the \nfacilities  to  treat  and  restore  the  defendantsโ  mental  health.  The  district \ncourt  entered  an  injunction  requiring  OSH  to  admit  mentally  incapacitated \ndefendants  within  seven  days  of  the  judicial  finding  of  their  incapacity  to \nproceed  fo  trial. \nThereafter,  OSH  moved  to  stay  the  injunction  pending  appeal  and  to  clarify \nand  modify  the  injunction  so  that  the  seven-day  period  would  begin  to  run \nupon  OSH's  receipt  of  notice  of  a  finding  of  unfitness.  On  May  27,  2002, \nthe  district  court  denied  both  motions.  OSH  timely  appealed.  On  โF708 \nJune  13,  2002,  this  court  granted  OSH's  emergency  motion  to  stay  the \ninjunction  pending  appeal.s \niV.  issues \nOSH  does  not  dispute  that  mentally  ill  persons  who  are  accused  of  crime \nhave  constitutionally  protected  due  process  rights  that  the  state  is  obliged \nto  honor.  Nor  does  OSH  seriously  contest  that  jaiis  are  inferior  to  OSH  in \ntheir  ability  to  evaluate  and  treat  mentally  ill  defendants,  or  that  defendants \ndenied  needed  care  are  harmed  thereby.  Rather,  OSH's  primary  defenses \nare  that  (a)  neither  OAC  nor  MPD  has  standing  to  sue  and  (b)  in  any  event, \nlability  lies  not  with  OSHโwhich  under  its  reading  of  the  Oregon  statute \nhas  no  duty  to  mentally  ill  defendants  until  it  has  a  bed  available  and \nactually  takes  custody  of  them-โโbut  with  the  county  jails  who  have  the  legal \nduty  to  maintain  and  care  for  the  defendants  until  OSH  can  accept  them. \nWe  address  these  and  other  of  OSH's  arguments  below. \nDISCUSSION \nI.

Whether \nan  organization  may / assert  a  claim  on  behalf  of  its  members  triggers  both \nconstitutional  and  prudential  concerns.

Criminal  defendants  found  unfit  to  proceed  to  trial  do  suffer \nfrom  mental  iliness,  and  OAC  is  attempting  to  pursue  legal  remedies  to \nensure  the  protection  of  such  individuals.  Therefore,  we  accept  OAC's \nargument  that  Congress  intended  to  confer  standing  to  pursue  suits  like \nthis  one  on  organizations  like  OAC.  Nevertheless,  OAC's  argument  that  it \ntherefore  necessarily  has  standing  must  fail. \nThe  question  whenever  Congress  attempts  to  confer  standing  is  whether \nthe  particular  obstacle  that  Congress  has  attempted  to  remove  is \nโconstitutional  and  absolute,  or Prucentiaโ  and  maileable  by  Congress.โ \nUnifed  Food,  577  Us.  at  557,  716  S.Ct.  1528. OSH's  standing  challenges \nunder  the  first  prong  of  Hunt  and  under  causation  (addressed  in  section \n|.A.2  below)  concern  standing  requirements  that  are  โconstitutional  and \nabsoluteโ  in  nature.  Thus  PAMIlโalthough  relevant  to  the  standing \nanalysisโdoes  not  definitively  answer  the  question  whether  OAC  has \nstanding. \nWe  therefore  turn  to  OSH's  challenges  to  OAC's  associational  standing. \nFirst,  OSH  claims  OAC  fails  the  first  prong  of  Hunt  because  mentally \nincapacitated  defendants,  although  constituents  of  OAC,  are  neither \nโmembersโ  of  OAC  nor  the  functional  equivalent  of  members.  Second,  OSH \nargues  that  OAC  fails  the  third  prong  of  Hunt  because  its  claims  require  the \nparticipation  of  the  individual  incapacitated  defendants.  We  address  each \nargument  in  turn. \n9 \nPut  in  starkest  terms,  OSH's  membership  argument  is  that  because \nโindividuals  with  mental  illness  [do  not]  actually  control  OAC's  activities  and \nfinances,โ  OAC  cannot  claim  standing  to  represent  their  interests.  In \nconstitutional  terms,  the  essence  of  OSH's  position  is  that  without  a  direct \nmembership  linkage  to  incapacitated  defendants,  OAC  cannot  rely  on\ninjuries  to  those  mentally  ill  defendants  to  meet  the  injury  in  fact \nrequirement  and  establish  the  personal  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the \nlitigation  that  the  Constitution  demands. \nWe  think  OSH's  membership  argument  is  overly  formalistic.  Given  OAC's \nstatutory  mission  and  focus  under  PAMII,  its  constituentsโin  this  case,  the \nmentally  incapacitated  defendantsโare  the  functional  equivaient  of \nmembers  for  purposes  of  associational  standing.  In  so  holding,  we  agree \nwith the  only  oยข ther  circuit  to  nave  addressed  the  question.  See  Dae vy. \nelineer,  175  F.3d  879,  886  Ci  tth  Cir. 1999)  (holding  that  a  PAMII \norganization  โ may  sue  on  behalf of  its  constituents  like  a  more  traditional \nassociation  may  sue  on  behalf  of  its  membersโ). \nQur  holding  also  comports  with  Hunt.  In  Hunt,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld \nthe  standing  of  the  Washington  State  Apple  Advertising  Commission,  a \nstate  agency,  to  challenge  a  North  Carolina  statute  that  imposed  labeling \nrestrictions  on  VW  ash hingtion  state  apple  growers  and  dealers.  Hunt,  432  0.9. \nat  345,  87  S.Ct 2434 1  North  Carolina  argued  that  the  Commission  was  not \na  traditional  voluntary  membership  organization  asserting  claims  of  its \nmembers,  but  rather  a  state  agency  that  was  seeking  to  assert  claims  on \nbehalf  of  apple  growers  and  dealers,  who  simply  formed  its  constituency. \nThus  the  Commission  purportedly  lacked  theโ  Personal  โS997  stake\"  in  the \ntigation  needed  to  establish  constitutional  standing.  fd.  at 344F md,  OF  S.Ct. \n2434.  The  Court  concluded  otherwise.  The  Court  noted  first  that โ[t]he \nCommission,  while  admittedly  a  state  agency,  for  all  practical  purposes, \nperforms  the  functions  of  a  traditional  trade  association  representing  the \nWashington  apple  industry.โ  fa.  at  S44,  OF  S.Ct 2434. The  Court  found, \nmoreover,  that: \nwhile  the  apple  growers  and  dealers  are  not  โmembersโ  of  the  Commission \nin  the  traditional  trade  association  sense,  they  possess  all  of  the  indicia  of \nmembership  in  an  organization.  They  alone  elect  the  members  of  the \nCommission;  they  alone  may  serve  on  the  Commission;  they  alone  finance \nits  activities,  including  the  costs  of  this  lawsuit,  through  assessments  levied \nupon  them. \nid,  at  @44โ45,  OF  S.Ct. 2434.  Finally,  the  Court  noted  that  โthe  interests  of \nthe  Commission  tself  mayy  be  adversely  affected  by  the  outcome  of  thie] \nlitigation,โ  because  the  annual  assessments  paid  to  the  Commission \ndepend  on  the  size  of  ine  market  for  apples grown  and  packaged  as \nโWashington  Apples.โ  fd.  af  345,  O97  S.Ct.  2434.  Refusing  to โexalt  form \nover  substance  to  differentiate  between  the Washington  Commission  and  a \ntraditional  trade  association  representing  the  individual  growers  and \ndealers  who  collectively  form  its  constituency,โ  the  Court  held  that  the\nCommission  had  standing  as  the  functional  equivalent  of  such  a  trade \nassociation.  fd. \nsimilarly,  we  conclude  that,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  OAC \nhad  standing  to  sue  on  behaif  of  incapacitated  criminal  defendants,  OAC  is \nthe  functional  equivalent  of  a  voluntary  membership  organization.  Accord \neuncer,  175  F.3da t  885-86.  Like  the  Commission  in  Hunt,  as  OSH \nimplicitly  concedes,  OAC  serves  a  specialized  segment  of  Oregon's \ncommunity:  the  disabled  in  general,  including  the  mentally  ill  and,  more \nspecifically,  incapacitated  criminal  defendants.  Those  groups  are  the \nprimary  beneficiaries: ot  ORG Ss  activities,  โincluding  the  prosecution  of  this \nkind  of  litigation.โ  f  432  U.S. at 344,  OF  S.Ct 2434 \nAcmittedly,  the  constituents  of  OAC c do  not  have all  the  indicia  of \nmembership  that  the  Hunt  apple  growers  and  dealers  possessed.  OAC  is \nfunded  primarily  by  the  federal  government,  and  not  by  its  constituents. \nOAC's  constituents  are  not  the  only  ones  who  choose  the  leadership  of \nOAC,  and  they  are  not  the  only  ones  who  may  serve  on  OAC's  leadership \nbodies.  Nevertheless,  OAC's  constituents  do  possess  many  indicia  of \nmembershipโ-enough  to  satisfy  the  purposes  that  undergird  the  concept  of \nassociational  standing:  that  the  organization  is  sufficiently  identified  with \nand  subject  to  the  influence  of  those  it  seeks  to  represent aa s  to  nave  a \nโpersonal  s  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the  controversy.โ  see  \\  P Arlington \nHeights, 429  U.S.  al 267,  OF  S.Ct  555  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted), \nUnder  PAMI,  the  governing  board  of  an  organization  like  OAC  โshall  be \ncomposed  of  ...  members  ...  who  broadly  represent  or  are  knowledgeable \nabout  the  needs  of  the  clients  served  by  the  system,โ  where  such  members \nare  defined  to  include  โindividuals  who  have  received  or  are  receiving \nmenial  nealth s  services  and  family  members  of  such  individuals.โ  42 U.S.C. \nยง  TOS05(c}  1)(8).

Furthermore,  PAMII  provides  that  a  system  such  as \nOAC  shall  โestablish  a  grievance  procedure  for  clients  or  prospective \nclients  of  the  system  to  assure  that  individuals  with  mental  illness  have  full \naccess  to  the  services  of  the  system  and  ...  to  assure  that  the  ...  system  is\noperating  in  compliance  with  the  provisionsโ of  PAMIL  fa.  ยง  TO805(a\\9)}. \nOAC's  executive  director,  Robert  Joondeph,  provided  undisputed  testimony \nthat  people  with  cisabilities  constitute  a  majority  of  OAC's  board  of  directors \nand  that  individuals  who  had  received  or  were  receiving  mental  health \nservices,  or  family  members  of  such  individuals,  compose  more  than  60 \npercent  of  the  advisory  council  for  OAC'โs  PAMII-funded  program.

OAC's  Standing:  Causation \n12 \nFinally,  OSH  argues  that  OAC  has  failed  to  establish  the  second \nconstitutional  requisite  of  standingโa  causal  connection  between  its \ninjuries  and  OSH's  conduct.  Specifically,  OSH  argues  that  any  injury  to \nincapacitated  defendants  and  OAC  is  not  fairly  traceable  to  OSH's  actions \nbecause,  before  OSH  has  beds  available  and  actually  takes  custody  of \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants,  Oregon  counties,  not  OSH,  have  the \nduty  to  provide  these  defendants  with  constitutionally  adequate  care.  If  the \ncounty  jails  were  providing  adequate  treatment,  then  incapacitated  criminal \ndefendants  and  OAC  wouic  not  suffer  any  injury  or  adverse  effect. \nTherefore,  even  if  the  delay  in  treatment  causes  injury,  OSH  is  not  the \ncause  of  the  delay.  We  disagree. \n13 \nUnder  Oregon  law,  OSH  has  the  duty  to  accept  and  treat  mentally \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants.  The  question  is  whether  that  duty \nresides  in  or  shifts  to  county  jailers  until  such  time  as  OSH  has  an  available \nbed  for  and  accepts  the  defendant.  The  answer  is  found  in  the  plain \nmeaning  of  the  governing  statute. \nIn  interpreting  a  statute,  the  court's  task  is  to  discern  the  intent  of  the \nlegislature.

OSH  Its  the  only  designated  state  mental  hospital. \nsignificantly,  the  statute  makes  no  mention  of  any  intermediary,  county  jail \nor  otherwise,  to  whom  the  court  can  commit  a  mentaily  incapacitated \ndefendant  before  either  committing  the  defendant  to  OSH  or  releasing  the \ndefendant  on  supervision.s  By  statute,  therefore,  the  court  has  only  two \nalternatives:  it  can  commit  the  defendant  to  OSH  or  release  the  defendant \non  supervision.  There  is  no  middle  ground. \nA  fair  reading  of  the  statute's  text  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  aimec \ndirectly  at  keeping  mentally  incompetent  defendants  out  of  county  jails,  not \nat  conferring  responsibility  on  those  jails  for  interim  treatment.  OSH's \nstatutory  duty  is  triggered  whenever  a  court  decides  to  commit  a  defendant \nto  OSH  rather  than  release  the  defendant. \nOSH  argues  that  a  former  version  of  ORS  ยง  167.370, which  was  passed  in \n1999  but  which  expired  at  the  end  of  2001  due  to: a  sunset  provision, \nreflects  a  deliberate  decision  by  the  Oregon  legislature  to  make  counties \nresponsible  for  the  care  and  treatment  of  incapacitated  criminal  defendants \nuntil  OSH  accepts  them.  As  we  have  said,  the  prior  version  of  the  statute  is \npart  of  its  context  under  Oregon  jurisprudence,  but  the  1999  statute  does \nnot  detract  from  our  reading  of  the  current  law. \nThe  pre-1999  version  of  the  statute  resembled  the  current  version.

Tne  Oregon  legislature  revised ORS  ยง \nQO temporarily  to  give  OSH  an  opportunity  to  address  that  problem. \nThe legislatureโ s  decision  in  2001  to  restore  the  statute  to  its  pre~1999 \nversion,  excising  all  references  to  periods  of  delay  and  conditions  on \ntransfer  to  OSH,  suggests  that  the  legislature  intenced  what  the  statutory \ntext  now  provides:  courts  are  either  to  commit  incapacitated  defendants  to \nOSH  (not  to  county  jails)  or  release  them  under  supervision.  The  sunsetting \nof  the  old  version  also  can  be  understood  as  OSH  urges,  as  a  legislative \nsignal  that  there  now  is  no  time  limit  on  OQSH's  taking  custody  of \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants,  so  that  county  jas must  care  for  them  in \nthe  interim.  But  the  historical  context  of  ORS  ยง  161.370  by  no  means \ncompels  OSH's  interpretation.  Because  the  historical  context  can  be  read \neither  way,  we  interpret  the  current  text  fo  mean  what  it  says:  the  trial  court \nmay  either  commit  an  incapacitated  defendant  to  the  custody  of  OSH  or \nmay  release  such  a  defendant  under  supervision.  Under  the  first  option, \nOSH  has  the  correlative  duty  to  accept  custody. \nWe  therefore  conclude  that  under  Oregon  law,  it  is  not  the  counties  but \nOSH  that  has  the  duty  to  accept  and  treat  incapacitated  defendants  once \nthey  have  been  certified  as  such  by  a  circuit  court.  Consequently,  OSHโ's \nargument  that  OAC  lacks  standing  for  want  of  a  causal  link  between  its \ninjuries  and  OSH's  untimely  acceptance  of  incapacitated  defendants  must \nfail. \ninsum,  OAC  meets  the  constitutional  requirements  for  standing,  and \nprudential  requirements  pose  no  obstacle.  OAC  has  standing  to  sue  on \nbehalf  of  its  constituentsโthe  mentally  incapacitated  defendants. \n3.  Vootness \n14 \n15 \nOSH  also  challenges  our jurisdiction  over  OAC's  claim  on  the  ground  OF \nmootness. Mootness |  is  a  question  of  law, whicn  we  review  de  novo.  cde \nv.  Airkfand,  T1718  Sd  607,  o69  (9th  Cir.  1997). OSH  argues  that  OAC's _ \nclaim  is  moot  because  all  seven  persons held  in  county  jails  awaiting \nadmission  to  OSH  at  the  time  the  action  was  filed  were  in  fact  admitted  to \nOSH  by  the  time  the  trial  began.  OSH  claims  that  the  individualsโ\nadmittance  to  OSH  mooted  not  only  Madison's  claim,  but  also  OAC's  claim \non  his  and  the  six  other  individualsโ  behalf.  We  disagree. \n16 \nโMootness  can  be  characterized  as  the  doctrine  of  standing  set  in  a  time \nframe:  The  requisite  personal  interest  that  must  exist  at  the \ncommencement  of  the  ligation  (standing)  must  continue vgn  its \nexistence  (mootness).โ  Cook  infef Treaty  Tribes  v. _oeaiele,  166  F  3d  986 \nO 89  (9th  Cir. 1999) internal  quotation  marks  omitted); \nOS  aw  000} }  (noting  that  this  way  of  describing  mootness \niss  not  comprehensive)  1 Thus,  โlajn  actual  controversy  must  be  extant at  all \nstages  of  review,  not  merely  at  the  time  the  complaint is  filed.โ  Sernharat, \n2?

First,  the  record  reflects  that  the  detention  of  incapacitated \ncriminal  defendants  for  weeks  or  months  in  Oregon  county  jails  is  an \nongoing,  pervasive  and  systemic  problem.  OSH  has  proffered  no  evidence \nto  suggest  that  this  problem  has  ceased  and  has  conceded  facts  that \nstrongly  suggest  the  contrary.  As  the  district  court  found,  and  as  OSH \nconcedes,  during  2001  and  early  2002  incapacitated  criminal  defendants \nspent  on  average  about  one  month  in  county  jails  before  OSH  accepted \nthem  for  the  requisite  evaluation  and  treatment.  In  many  cases,  defendants \nhad  to  wait  two,  three  or  even  five  months.  As  of  March  25,  2002,  the \nhearing  date  for  plaintiffsโ  motions  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  a \npreliminary  injunction,  OSH  had  a  list  of  11  such  defendants  awaiting \ntransport  to  OSH.  In  light  of  the  record  and  of  OSH's  failure  to  proffer \ncontrary  evidence,  we  must  assume  that  the  detention  of  incapacitated \n  \ncriminal  defendants  in  Oregon  county  jails  for  weeks  or  months  continues \n  \n    \n  \nfo  occur. \nAlthough  this  is  not  a  class  action,  the  circumstances  here  are  analogous  to \nthose  found  in  class  action  cases  where,  because  of  the  inherently \ntransitory  nature  of  the  claims,  the  trial  court  does  not  have  enough  time  to \nrule  on  a  motion  for  class  certification  before  the  proposed  eeresenanve  s \nindividual  interest  expires.  See Gersfein  v.  Pugh,  420  U.S. 103,  110-11  9. \n11i,  9!

In  Gerstein,  the \nsupreme  Court โassumed  that  the  named  plaintiffs  were  no  longer in \ncustody  awaiting  trial  at  the  time  the  trial  court  certified  a  class  of  pretrial \ndetainees.  There  was  no  indication  that  the  particular  named plaintiffs  | \nmight  again  be  subject  to  pretrial  detention.โ  Geraghty,  445  U.S.  at  399, \n{OO  S.Ct.  1202  (interpreting  Gerstein  ).8 Nevertheless,  the  Court  held  that \nthe  case  was  not  moot,  because: \nThe  length  of  pretrial  custody  cannot  be  ascertained  at  the  outset,  and  it \nmay  be  ended  at  any  time  by  release  on  recognizance,  dismissal  of  the \ncharges,  or  a  guilty  plea,  as  well  as  by  acquittal  or  conviction  after  trial.  It  is \nby  no  means  certain  that  any  given  individual,  named  as  plaintiff,  would  be \nin  pretrial  custody  long  enough  for  a  district judge  to  certify  the  class. \nMoreover,  in  this  case  the  constant  existence  of a  class  of persons \nsuffering  the  deprivation  is  certain.  The  attorney  representing  the  named \nrespondents  is  a  public  defender,  and  we  can  safely  assume  that  he  has \nother clients with  a  continuing  live interest | in  the  case. \n420 OLS,a t  170-71  9.  11,  88  3.CL.  854  (emphasis  added).  Here, \nf-s3 of SF fey\nas  in Gerstein,  the  length  of  detention  in  the  county  jail  is  short  enough  that \nany  individual  detaineeโs  claim  would  probably  become  moot  before  trial.  In \naddition,  the  constant  existence  of  OAC  constituents  suffering  the \ndeprivation  is  certain. \nThe  second  reason  why  OAC's  claims  are  not  moot  is  that  OAC  challenges \nnot  only  OSH's  delay  in  admitting  the  seven  individuals  held  in  county  jails \nat  the  time  the  suit  was  brought,  but  also  fhe  policy  that  results  in  such \ndelays.  As  we  noted  earlier,  OSH  does  not  dispute  its  policy  of  turning \naway  mentally  incapacitated  defendants,  nor  does  it  dispute  its  continuing \nfailure  to  devote  resources  sufficient  to  provide  an  adequate  number  of \nbeds.  Furthermore,  OSH  has  taken  the  categorical  legal  position  that  it  is \nnot  responsible  for  ensuring  the  timely  admission  of  incapacitated  criminal \ndefendants.  The  continued  and  uncontested  existence  of  the  policy  that \ngave rim se @  to  OAC's  legal  cnalienge  forecloses  OSH's  mootness  argument. \nsos  โ~  . \nSee  b  Si PPepN eeeGR   naan AfaSAtT o Tref t,   SmBrasatd a  oorndy   ASS!

(internal  citations  omitted). \nThe  circumstances  here  present  an  even  stronger  argument  against \nmootness.  Rather  than  merely  failing  to  contest  the  existence  of  its  policy  of \ndenying  timely  admittance  of  mentally  incapacitated  defendants,  OSH \nacknowledges  the  policy  and  seeks  to  justify  it  by  placing  the  responsibility \nwith  the  county  jails.  In  addition,  although  there  Is  no  indication  in \nUkrainian-American  Bar Ass'n  that  there  were  ongoing  cases  like  Medvid's \nat  the  time  of  trial,  here  the  record  shows  that  OSH's  policy  results  in \ncontinually  recurring  delays  in  the  transfer  of  mentally  incapacitated \ncriminal  defendants  to  OSH. \nIn  light  of  the  undisputed  facts  in  the  record  and  OSH's  burden  in \nestablishing  mootness,  we  conclude  that  OAC  has  โa  legally  cognizable \ninterest  for  which  the  courts  can  grant  a  remedy.โ  Alaska  C~t r,  189  F Ssd   at \niH.  Validity  of  the  Injunction  on  the  Merits \nOSH  challenges  the  injunction  entered  against  it  on  the  merits.  OSH \nargues  that  the  district  court  violated  principles  of  federalism  when  it\ndetermined  that  OSH,  rather  than  Oregon's  counties,  must  provide  timely \ntreatment  to  incapacitated  criminal  defendants.  OSH  also  argues  that  the \ndistrict  court  erred  in  concluding  that  OSH  violated  due  process  and  in \nrequiring  that  criminal  defendants  be  given  mental  health  treatment  within \nseven  days  of  being  declared  unfit.  Again,  we  address  each  argument  in \nturn. \nA.  Federalism \nOSH  argues  that  it  is  for  the  Oregon  legisiature,  not  the  federal  courts,  to \ndecide  which  entity  within  the  Oregon  state  government  must  provide  and \npay  for  the  treatment  of  mentaily  incapacitated  criminal  defendants. \nFurthermore,  OSH  argues,  the  Oregon  legislature  has  already  decided  that \nthe  county  jails  must  provide  for  such  treatment  until  OSH  has  a  bed \navailable.  On  this  basis,  OSH  concludes  that  the  district  court's  injunction \nviolates  principles  of  federalism  because  it  contravenes  a  decision  within \nthe  exclusive  province  of  the  Oregon  legislature. \n17 \nWe  need  not  address  OSH's  federalism  argument,  however,  because  it  is \npremised  on  an  interpretation  of  ORS  ยง  161.370  that  we  have  already \nrejected.  Under  Oregon  law  it  is  OSH,  not  counties,  that  has  the  duty  to \naccept  incapacitated  defendants  once  they  have  been  certified  as  such  by \na  circuit  court.  The  injunction  is  consistent  with  the  legislative  choice \nembodied  in  the  statute,  and  thus  with  principles  of  federalism. \n6B.  Due  Process  Violations \nThe  district  court  held  that  criminal  defendants  declared  unfit  to  proceed  to \ntrial  under  ORS  ยง  167.370  have  the  right  under  substantive  and  procedural \ndue  process  to  โreasonably  timely  transport  to  a  treatment  facility.โ  OSH \nviolates  that  right,  the  district  court  held,  by  failing  to  admit  incapacitated \ncriminal  defendants  within  seven  days  of  the  issuance  of  the  court  order \ndeclaring  them  unfit.  As  we  noted  earlier,  OSH  does  not  dispute  that \nmentaily  ill  persons  accused  of  a  crime  have  due  process  rights  that  the \nstate  is  obliged  to  honor.  Nor  does  OSH  seriously  contest  that  jails  are \ninferior  to  OSH  in  their  ability  to  evaluate  and  treat  mentally  ill  defendants, \nor  that  defendants  denied  needed  care  are  harmed  thereby.  OSH  arques, \nhowever,  that  (1)  any  alleged  substantive  due  process  violation  must  be \nmeasured  by  the  deliberate  indifference  standard;  (2)  the  district  court \nfailed  to  engage  in  the  individualized  assessment  required  by  the  deliberate \nindifference  standard;  and  (3)  under  such  an  individualized  assessment, \nOSH  was  not  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  needs  of  any  individual \nincapacitated  criminal  defendant.16 \n18\nIn  assessing  the  merits  of  OSH's  due  process arguments,  we  are  mindful \nthat  by  statute  OSH  is  solely  responsible  โ} 720  for  the  timely  treatment  of \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  so  that  they  may  become  competent  to \nstand  trial.  We  are  also  mindful  of  the  undisputed  harms  that  incapacitated \ncriminal  defendants  suffer  when  they  spend  weeks  or  months  in  jail  waiting \nfor  transfer  to  OSH.  These  harms  incluce  the  following:  Although  jails  can \nsometimes  provide  treatment  to  stabilize  a  patient,  they  cannot  restore  a \npatient  to  competency.  Thus,  incarceration  in  a  county  jail  delays  an \nincapacitated  criminal  defendant's  possible  return  to  competency.  The \ndisciplinary  system that  jails  use  to  control  inmates  is  ineffective  for,  and \npossibly  harmful  to,  incapacitated  criminal  defendants.  Because  of  their \nunpredictable  or  disruptive  behavior,  they  are  often  locked  in  their  cells  for \n22  to  23  hours  a  day,  which  further  exacerbates  their  mental  illness. \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  have  a  high  risk  of  suicide,  and  the \nlonger  they  are  deprived  of  treatment,  the  greater  the  likelihood  they  will \ndecompensaie  and  suffer  unduly.  These  and  other  undisputed  harms, \ntogether  with  OSH's  statutory  mandate  to  provide  timely  restorative \ntreatment,  support  our  conclusion  below  that  OSH's  delay  in  admitting \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  violates  their  substantive  due  process \nrights. \n19 \nFirst,  we  reject  OSH's  claim  that  the  deliberate  indifference  standard \ngoverns  the  due  process  rights  of  incapacitated  criminal  defendants. \nPretrial  detainees,  whether  or  not  they  have  been  declared  unfit  to  proceed, \nhave  not  been  convicted  of  any  crime.  Therefore,  constitutional  questions \nregarding  the  conditions  and  circumstances  of  their  confinement  are \nproperly  addressed  under  the  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmencment,  rather  than  under  thes a   Am endment 's protection  against \n tege\nr Ja};  iaAoes.

To \napply  the  deliberate  indifference  standard  here  would  be  to  relegate \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  to  the  same  level  of  treatment  afforded  to \nconvicted  prisoners,  a  result  Youngberg  rejected.  See  id.  al  325,  702 SCL. \n452  (concluding  that โthe  jury  was  erroneously  instructed  on  the \nassumotion  that  the  proper  standard  of  Hability  was  that  of  the  Eighth \nAmendmentโ);  see  also Patten  v.

Therefore,  we  hold  that  the  substantive  due \nprocess  rights  of  incapacitated  criminal  defendants  are  not  governed  solely \nby  the  deliberate  indifference  standard.โ \nRather  than  look  to  the  protections  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  for  a  guiding \nstandard,  we  look  instead  to  the  Supreme  Court's  and  our  own  substantive \ndue  process  jurisprudence.  Before  determining  and  applying  the \nappropriate  stancard  for  imposing  liability,  we  identify  the  substantive  due \nprocess  rights  at  issue. \n21 \nincapacitated  criminal  defendants  have  liberty  interests  in  freedom  from \nincarceration  and  in  restorative  treatment.  โThe  Supreme  Court  has \nrecognized  that  an  individual  has a  liberty  interest  in  being f ree  from \n   \nincarceration  absent  a criminal  conviction.โ  i,  Weug \nsak  P~ o oo Taareo   TUaa e vaa  (Oh  Cir 1992) โ(citing 8   are  | feCoโ  lan,  4s 43w8ey   EUR  \nwa  B  eioM    POfasP P c  MP  PPMadGe   tus Se  sa  oe ot aK  SeEs CoPvae  es  Bยงy   wt  a ke \nASF  AAA  g e 4wA nihpO e ae h raw  p we BC. tr saA   pent.

Furthermore,  even  if  it  is  determined  that  the  defendant  probably \nsoon  will  be  able  to  stand  trial,  his  continued  commitment  must  be  justified \nby  progress  toward  that  goal. \nIn  reaching  that  conclusion,  the  Court  explained:  โAt  the  least,  due  process\n  \nrequires  that  the  nature  and  duration  of  commitment  bear  some  reasonable \nrelation  to  the  purpose  for  which  the  individual  is  committed.โ  fd.

Only  OSH  has  the  highly \ntrained  staff  and  other  resources  needed  to  identify  and  treat  an \nincapacitated  criminal  defendant's  mental  illness.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON \nOREGON ADVOCACY CENTER, 1 et al., \nPlaintiffs,  No. 3:02-cv-339-MO \nv.  OPINION AND ORDER \nPATRICK ALLEN, et al., \nDefendants. \nMOSMAN,J., \nPlaintiffs Disability Rights Oregon (DRO) and Metropolitan Public Defender (MPD) seek a \nmodification of the injunction in this case to allow for monitoring of Defendants, a status hearing in six \nmonths on Defendants' continued compliance with the injunction, and a designation of prevailing party \nstatus under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988.  [134 and 140].  As discussed below, I DENY Plaintiffs' requests. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Injunction and Plaintiffs' Motions for Contempt \nIn 2002, Judge Panner issued an injunction requiring Defendants to transport criminal \ndefendants designated unfit under ORS 161.370 to the Oregon State Hospital within seven days \nof the order declaring the defendant unfit.  [4  7].  He did not assign Plaintiffs to monitor \nDefendants' compliance with the Order.  Id  Defendants complied with the injunction for sixteen \nyears but fell out of compliance in October 2018.  [140 at 3].  The noncompliance lasted until \n1 Oregon Advocacy Center is now Disability Rights Oregon.  [91 at 2]. \n1-Opinion and Order \n\nJuly 25, 2019, a period of about nine months.  [144 at 3].  In May 2019, Plaintiffs filed Motions \n[85 and 91] for contempt.  After the June 11, 2019, hearing on those motions, I declined to make \na finding of contempt.  [127].  Because Defendants remained out of compliance at the June \nhearing, I set a compliance hearing for ninety-days out on September 12, 2019.  Id. \nII.  Plaintiffs' Requests for Modification of the Injunction and to be Declared the \nPrevailing Party in their Contempt Motions \nOn August 23, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Brief for the Compliance Hearing (compliance \nhearing brief) [134] that requested I:  (1) consider modifying the Order [47] granting injunctive \nrelief in this case to allow for monitoring of Defendants by the Court and by Plaintiffs [134 at 3-\n4, 5,7]; (2) set a status hearing in six months to determine whether Senate Bills 24 and 25 \nundermined Defendants' compliance with the injunction and pretrial detainees' constitutional \nrights Id; and (3) declare them the \"prevailing party under [42] U.S.C. ยง 1988 so that they may \nseek an award of attorney fees and costs.\"  [I d. at 7]. \nIn support of the request to modify and set a hearing in six months, Plaintiffs asserted that \nDefendants' several months of noncompliance warrants monitoring and that new legislation, \nSenate Bills (SB) 24 and 25 will likely result in continued violation of the injunctions.  Plaintiffs \nargued that SB 24 requires diversion to community restoration programs that do not yet exist. \n[134 at 6].  Plaintiffs argued they met section 1988's definition of prevailing party despite no \nfinding of contempt because Defendants only began to reduce the wait list for admission to the \nstate hospital in May 2019, after Plaintiffs filed their contempt Motions.  Id.  According to \nPlaintiffs, I could \"reasonably attribute the state's response as at least partially prompted by the \ncontempt action\" and declare them the prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988.  Id. (emphasis \nadded).  Defendants filed a two-page response that addressed only Plaintiffs' request to be \ndeclared the prevailing party.  [137]. \n2-Opinion and Order \n\nDuring the September 12, 2019, compliance hearing, Plaintiffs relied on their argument \nthat their motivation of Defendants' conformity to the injunction warranted prevailing party \nstatus.  [143 at 5:16-6:13].  They also, for the first time, asserted that their efforts to enforce the \ninjunction-their \"monitoring\" work-entitled them to fees.  To give the parties a chance to \nbrief Plaintiffs new argument for fees, I took the Plaintiffs' monitoring, six-month status hearing, \nand prevailing party requests under advisement and allowed supplemental briefing on the \nattorney fees issue. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Plaintiffs' Request for Prevailing Party Status \nTo be entitled to prevailing party fees under section 1988, a party must have \"succeed[ed] \non any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in \nbringing the suit.\" Hensley v. Eckerharhart, 461 U.S. 424,433 (1983) (citations omitted).  In \ncases where a party previously prevailed, fees may, under certain circumstances, be allowed for \nefforts leading to a motion that was denied.  Balla v. Idaho, 677 F.3d 910, 916 (2012). \nGenerally, however, for trial court to act within its discretion in awarding a party fees for a lost \nmotion, the motion must have been the catalyst in achieving the benefit the motion sought.  Id \nHere, the parties agree that Plaintiffs were the original prevailing parties in this action.  They \ndisagree about whether Plaintiffs actions-either their \"post-judgment monitoring\" or filing the \ncontempt Motions--catalyzed Defendants to conform with the injunction in July 2019. \nIn their supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs make a conclusory argument that their \"post \njudgment monitoring\" is compensable because it forced Defendants' back into compliance with \nthe injunction.  As noted above, Judge Panner did not charge Plaintiffs with monitoring \nDefendants' compliance with the injunction.  Despite this, however, plaintiff DRO asserts that it \n3-Opinion and Order \n\n\"performed monitoring for sixteen years with no petition for fees.\"  [140 at 9].  Plaintiff MPD \ndoes not assert that it performed any monitoring over the past sixteen years but does assert that it \n\"similarly made extensive efforts to force Defendants into compliance.\"  [140 at 9]. \nThe cases cited by Plaintiffs in their supplemental briefing generally support the \nproposition that reasonable monitoring of a court's decrees to insure compliance and that the \ncourt's plan is working is compensable.  See, e.g. Northcross v. Ed. ofE d. ofM  emphis City Sch., \n611 F .2d 624, 63 7 (1979) ( overruled on other grounds) (providing guidance to the district court \non remand that \"services devoted to reasonable monitoring of the court's decrees, both to insure \nfull compliance and to ensure that the plan is indeed working ... are compensable services\"); \nGarrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727, 738 (1st Cir. 1984) (finding the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in awarding fees for monitoring work stemming from disputes between counsel about \nvarious items detailed in the court's order of implementation). \nIn those cases, however, the underlying judgments or settlements provided for either \nmonitoring or other additional work after the entry of judgment.  For example, in Garrity, after \nissuing a decision, the court \"directed the parties to work out a joint plan\" to implement its \ndecision.  Garrity, 752 at 730.  The parties instead presented the court with two competing plans, \nwhich the court combined.  Id.  The plaintiffs then moved for attorney fees related to the parties' \ndispute over how to implement the court's decision.  Id.  Here, however, neither Judge Parmer' s \nOrder nor any agreement between the parties provides for monitoring or any other additional \nwork.  Accordingly, neither DRO's monitoring work nor MPD's efforts to force Defendants into \ncompliance are compensable. \nDespite arguing that monitoring fees are compensable, Plaintiffs supplemental briefing \nstates they \"seek fees now only for their time spent bringing this contempt motion.\"  [140 at 9] \n4-Opinion and Order \n\n( emphasis added).  Plaintiffs contend that their \"efforts resulted in success in modifying the \nstates behavior\" to resume compliance with the 2002 injunction, noting that it was \"only after \nPlaintiffs' contempt motions were filed that Defendants issued a compliance plan\" and only after \nI set a compliance hearing for September 12 that Defendants \"opened hospital beds that could \nhave been opened eight months ago.\"  Id. at 11. \nDefendants dispute Plaintiffs' contention that the contempt motions and compliance \nhearing deadline motivated them to come back into compliance with the injunction in July 2019. \nIn support, they rely in part on compliance and hospital admission history.  Specifically, during \ntime between October 2018 and May 2019, when Plaintiffs filed their Motions, there were \nsignificant periods when the state hospital admitted criminal defendants during the seven-day \n,r \ntime limit, which shows that the contempt Motions did not drive Defendants efforts.  [145 at \n9].  Defendants further argue that they resumed compliance due to five developments that all \nresulted from work begin in 2018 or before:  (1) the passage of SB 24, which decreases \ncommitment orders and improves discharge; (2) passage of SB 25, which eliminates delayed \ndelivery of orders to the state hospital; (3) increased funding to counties for community services; \n(4) increased capacity in the state hospital; and (5) improved admissions processes, which stems \nfrom hiring more evaluators. \nAs noted above, under the Ninth Circuit's holding in Balla, a trial court may be within its \ndiscretion to find that a party is entitled to prevailing party fees for a motion that was denied. \n677 F.3d at 916.  In Balla, the plaintiff prisoners were the prevailing parties in an injunction to \naddress prison overcrowding.  Id.  at 911.  Their subsequently appointed counsel filed a contempt \nmotion to enforce the injunction the prisoners won after the state refused to commit to obey the \ninjunction by any set date.  Id.at 913-14.  The state came back into compliance two weeks after \n5-Opinion and Order \n\nappointed counsel filed the contempt motion, and the court denied the motion before it was \nheard.  Id.  at 914.  The state admitted the motion motivated their return to compliance.  Id. at 914 \nand 916.  In finding the district court's fee award reasonable, the Ninth Circuit noted: \"Despite \nlosing the battle over the contempt motion, the prisoners nevertheless won the war by inducing \nthe State's prompt return to compliance with the injunction.\" Id. at 920. \nHere, the record does not support a finding that Plaintiffs' contempt Motions were the \n\"catalyst that spurred\" Defendants into returning into compliance.  Balla, 677 F.3d at 916 (noting \nthe filing of the motion in that case was \"a 'catalyst' spurring defendants to conform quickly to \nthe injunction.\")  Plaintiffs contention that they were the motiving force behind Defendants \nconforming to the injunction appears to stem solely from the fact that defendants resumed \nconsistently admitting criminal defendants to the state hospital within seven days after Plaintiffs \nfiled their contempt Motions.  This argument, however, ignores the evidence in the record that \nestablishes that Defendants sporadically complied with the injunction between October 2018 and \n,r \nJuly 2019.  [145 at  9].  It likewise ignores that Defendants started working on solving their \ncapacity issue that led to their noncompliance well in advance of May 2019, when Plaintiffs' \n,r \nfiled their Motions.  Id.at  6.  Indeed, Plaintiffs' compliance hearing briefing appears to \nrecognize that their Motions were not fully responsible for Defendants' conformity with the \ninjunction because they asserted that I could \"reasonably attribute the state's response at least \npartially prompted by the contempt action.\"  [134 at 7]. \nBased on the record, I cannot find that Plaintiffs work to compel compliance with the \ninjunction was \"directly and reasonably incmred in enforcing the relief.\" Balla, 677 F.3d at 920. \nHere, unlike Balla, Plaintiffs loss-my failure to find Defendants in contempt at the June 2019 \nhearing-did not stem from the effectiveness of the Motions to compel.  Id.  Instead, it stemmed \n6-Opinion and Order \n\nfrom Defendants representation at the June 2019 hearing that they would return to compliance \nwithin ninety days of the hearing due to work they had started well before Plaintiffs filed their \ncontempt Motions in May 2019.  See, e.g. [130 at 10:3-10 (testimony of Pat Allen that in \nanticipation of a spike in demand for hospital beds by criminal defendants the Oregon Health \nAuthority began developing proposals \"eighteen months ago.\")].  Accordingly, I deny Plaintiffs' \nrequest to be declared the prevailing party under section 1988 and for an award of fees for their \ntime spent bringing their contempt Motions. \nII.  Plaintiffs' Request to Modify the Injunction to Allow Monitoring and a Status \nHearing \nPlaintiffs request that I modify Judge Parmer' s order to require \"periodic reports to the \nplaintiffs and the Court regarding the ongoing and uncontrolled growth of the aid and assist \npopulation and resulting implications to long term compliance.\" They also seek a status hearing \nin six months to determine whether SB 24 and 25 have undermined compliance and the \nconstitutional rights of pretrial detainees.  Defendants object to both requests. \n\"[A] party seeking modification of an [injunction] may meet its initial burden by showing \na significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" Rzifo v. Inmates ofS uffolk County \nJail, 502 U.S. 367,384 (1992); see also Sharp v.  Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2000) (\"A \nparty seeking modification or dissolution of an injunction bears the burden of establishing that a \nsignificant change in facts or law warrants revision or dissolution of the injunction\").  If the \nmoving party meets this burden, \"the court should consider whether the proposed modification is \nsuitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" Rzifo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. 748. \nModification may be wan-anted \"when changed factual conditions ma[k]e compliance ... \nsubstantially more onerous, ... when an [injunction] proves to be unworkable because of \n7-Opinion and Order \n\nunforeseen obstacles, ... or when enforcement of the decree without modification would be \ndetrimental to the public interest.\" Id. at 384. \nAccording to Plaintiffs, Defendants' \"seven months\" of noncompliance requires \nmonitoring.  [134].  Defendants' noncompliance, however, is not a significant change that meets \nthe standard for modification.  More persuasive is Plaintiffs' assertion that SB 24 and SB 25 will \nlikely result in continued violations of the injunction.  Plaintiffs argue that SB 24 requires \ndiversion to community restoration programs, but those programs do not yet exist.  [134 at 6]. \nDefendants offer evidence that, since the June 11, 2019, hearing, emergency funding has created \nthirty-two additional beds in Multnomah, Lane, and Coos counties, all of which were open for \n,r \nuse as of August 2019.  [145 at  3].  While the new legislation is a change in the law, it is not \nclear from the record that it is likely to have any negative effect on Defendants' compliance with \nthe injunction.  Because Plaintiffs have not met the standard for modification of the injunction, I \ndeny this request.  I also find that Plaintiffs have not established that a hearing in six months is \nnecessary. \nCONCLUSION \nI DENY Plaintiffs' requests [134] to modify the injunction, hold a status hearing in six months, \nand be declared the prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and their Motion [140] for attorney fees. \nk8 \nDATED this  day of October, 2019. \n8-Opinion and Order ",

The parties were not able to resolve this \ndispute. \n \n \n   \n \n \nPage 1 โ PLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR \nFINDING OF CONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR EXPEDITED HEARING \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 2 of 8\n \nMOTION \n  Plaintiff Metropolitan Public Defender Services, Inc. (hereinafter โMPDโ) moves this Court \nfor a finding of contempt for violating this Courtโs permanent injunction (Dkt. No. 51). Defendantsโ \nsuccessors-in-interest have admitted in sworn testimony that they have been violating this Courtโs \ninjunction since October 2018.1 Defendants conceded that they continue to violate this Courtโs \ninjunction and that there is little hope that they will cease violating this Courtโs injunction in the \nnear future. Defendants also admitted that they are aware of this Courtโs injunction, aware that they \nwere violating that injunction for the past seven months, and yet have made no effort to return to \nthis Court and ask that the injunction be modified. Therefore, MPD moves this Court to: \n1.  Find defendants in contempt based upon their sworn statements; \n2.  Allow plaintiff to obtain limited discovery from defendants in advance of a hearing, and; \n3.  Set an expedited hearing to determine: \na.  The necessary remedial sanctions to punish the defendants and compensate plaintiffs \nand those effected by their contempt for their injuries; \nb.  The necessary remedy to stop the ongoing violations, prevent future violations, and \ncompensate any victims of future violations. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 See plaintiffโs concurrently filed Motion to Substitute Defendants. Except where necessary to \nexplain historical facts, plaintiff refers to โdefendantsโ throughout this brief as the new defendants: \nPatrick Allen and Dolores Matteucci. \nPage 2 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 3 of 8\n \nBACKGROUND \nIn 2002, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Bobby Mink, then the directory of the \nDepartment of Human Services2, and Stanley Mazur-Hart, then the superintendent of the Oregon \nState Hospital (โOSHโ)3. They sued the defendants in their official capacities only, seeking \ninjunctive relief. Their claim was that the defendants were violating the due process rights of \ncriminal defendants who had been ordered committed to the state hospital, but were being held in \njail awaiting transport for inordinate amounts of time. Following a court trial (Dkt. No. 37), \nJudge Panner agreed. See Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, Dkt. No. 47 (hereinafter \nโFindingsโ). Judge Panner entered a permanent injunction, requiring defendants to admit patients \nโnot later than seven days after the issuance of [the] orderโฆ .โ Judgment, Dkt. No. 51. Judge \nPanner retained jurisdiction in this Court to enforce the injunction. Id. \nDefendants requested a stay of the order. Dkt. No. 49. Judge Panner denied that request. \nDkt. No. 65. Defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit upheld the \njudgment in all respects. Or. Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 332 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2003). At no time \nsince have the defendants or any of their successors in interest returned to this Court to seek \nmodification of the injunction. The law established in Mink is now the settled law of this circuit. \nSee, e.g., Trueblood v. Wash. Depโt. Social & Health Serv., 822 F.3d 1037 (2016). \nWhile the law has not changed since this Court issued its injunction, our understanding of \nthe damage done to individuals suffering from mental illness and going untreated in jails has. At \n                                                 \n2 At the time plaintiffs filed their complaint, DHS was the agency in charge of the state hospital. \nThat portion of DHSโs duties was carved out with the creation of the Oregon Health Authority in \n2009. The current director of the Oregon Health Authority is Patrick Allen. \n3 The current superintendent of OSH is Dolores โDollyโ Matteucci. \nPage 3 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 4 of 8\n \nthis time of the injunction, Judge Panner noted in his findings that imprisonment of people with \nuntreated mental illness โexacerbates their mental illness,โ Findings, at 6, that the โpopulation \nhas a high suicide risk, and psychosis can be an emergency requiring immediate treatment,โ id. at \n7, and that โ[d]epriving them of necessary medical treatment increases the likelihood that they \nmay decompensate and suffer unduly.โ Id. at 8. While all of that remains true, our understanding \nof the long term damage being done to this population of people has deepened and crystallized \nover the past 15 years.  \nIt is now a matter of scientific consensus that failing to treat psychosis leads to worse \nlong-term prognoses for treatment. See, e.g., McKenzie, Kwame, How Does Untreated Psychosis \nLead to Neurological Damage?, 59 Can. J. Psych. 511 (Oct. 2014); Clarke, et. al., Untreated \nIllness and Outcome of Psychosis, 189 British J. Psych. 235 (2006); Drake, et. al., Causes and \nConsequences of Duration of Untreated Psychosis in Schizophrenia, 177 British J. Psych. 511 \n(2000); Penttilรค, et. al., Duration of Untreated Psychosis as Predictor of Long-Term Outcome in \nSchizophrenia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, 205 British J. Psych. 88 (2014). While \nscientists continue to examine and debate the precise mechanism by which this damage occurs, \nthere is no debate that the damage is being done. Id. In simple terms, we now know that by \nfailing to treat psychosis, you are not only causing a person to โsuffer unduly,โ but you are \nactually causing brain damage which may prevent the person from ever recovering.  \nMeanwhile, the conditions of confinement for mentally ill prisoners in Oregonโs county \njails have not improved, nor has the quality of mental health care afforded them. A recent \ncomprehensive analysis conducted by Oregon Public Broadcasting found that the rate of suicide \namong prisoners in county jails has increased over the past decade. See Conrad Wilson, Tony \nPage 4 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 5 of 8\n \nSchick, Austin Jenkins, and Sydney Brownstone, Booked and Buried: Northwest Jailsโ Mounting \nDeath Toll (April 2, 2019) available online: https://www.opb.org/news/article/jail-deats-oregon-\nwashington-data-tracking. That same study found that 70% of jail deaths in Oregon and \nWashington were pretrial detainees. Id. Isolation exacerbates the risk of self-harm. Kaba, et. al., \nSolitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates, 104(3) Am. J. Pub. Health 442 \n(March 2014). That is likely because isolation itself causes psychological harm. Grassian, \nPsychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol. 325 (Jan. 2006).  \nBeginning in approximately October of 2018, criminal defense lawyers and judges \naround the state began noticing that it was taking longer for defendants to be transported to OSH. \nDue to the nature of Oregonโs court and defense system, the total scale of the problem was not \nimmediately apparent. That changed this spring when criminal defense lawyers in Washington \nCounty (including plaintiffโs employees) asked the presiding judge of that county, Charles \nBailey, to hold hospital officials (defendants here) in contempt for failing to abide by the \nindividual orders issued in criminal cases to transport within seven days. Judge Bailey held a \nseries of hearings, eventually ordering defendants to come to his court and explain why he \nshould not hold them in contempt. See State of Oregon v. Eric Gilbreth, Washington County \nCase Nos. 18CR84318 & 19CR06058; State of Oregon v. Gale Merrill, 18CR65775; State of \nOregon v. Dustin Lee Wood, 17CR75655; and State of Oregon v. Carlos Zamora-Skaar, \n18CR79052 & 18CR84154. In response to Judge Baileyโs order, the defendants, through counsel \nat the Oregon Department of Justice, submitted sworn declarations, outlining the shear breadth of \ntheir violations. Id.; Declaration of Jesse Merrithew, Ex. A (hereinafter โODOJ Memoโ).4 \n                                                 \n4 The entire submission by ODOJ is included as Exhibit A. \nPage 5 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 6 of 8\n \nAccording to their own sworn declarations, OSH is now violating the injunction in nearly \n100% of all new cases. Id. at 124. At the time this Court entered its injunction, the defendants \nwere transporting 18% of people within seven days of an order. Findings, at 7 ยถ 15. At the time \nof their declarations, there were 53 people who had been ordered into the custody of the \nsuperintendent but were still incarcerated in county jails around the state. ODOJ Memo, at 21. By \ncontrast, at the time this Court entered its injunction, there were only eleven people held in jails \naround the state and awaiting transport. See Findings, at 3-4. Although defendants did not \nprovide state wide data regarding how long people were waiting in jail to be transported, the \nanecdotal evidence suggests that delays today mirror those at the time of the injunction. Judge \nPanner found that the average wait time was 31.98 days in 2002. Id. at 7. MPD attorneys report \nthat recently their recent clients are taking approximately one month to be transported. \nDeclaration of Carl Macpherson. Also similar to the situation in 2002, the outlier cases are \nparticularly egregious. Mr. Zamora-Skaar, one of the defendants discussed above, has been \nwaiting 119 days as of this writing in the Washington County Jail waiting to be transported to the \nstate hospital. Compare, Findings, at 7 ยถ 15. \nAlso unchanged since 2002 is the defendantsโ defense of their actions: to claim poverty. \nThis Court specifically and categorically rejected this defense. โThere is no rationalization that \npasses constitutional muster for unreasonably detaining person found unfit to proceed in county \njails. The lack of funds, staff or facilities cannot justify defendantsโ failure to provide persons \nfound unfit with the treatment that is necessary to attempt restoration of competency.โ Findings, \nat 12. \n \nPage 6 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 7 of 8\n \nARGUMENT \n  This Court has broad inherent authority to enforce its orders. Spallone v. United States, \n493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990). In addition, this Court has explicit statutory authority to enforce its \norders through contempt. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 401(3). Neither willfulness nor intent is required, and \ngood faith is not a defense to a civil contempt finding. In re Dual Deck Video Cassette Recorder \nAntitrust Litig., 10 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir. 1993). Virtually the only defense available to a \ndefendant seeking to avoid a contempt finding is that they have taken โevery reasonable stepโ to \ncomply with the courtโs order and yet have been unable to do so. Stone v. City & County of San \nFrancisco, 968 F.2d 850, 856-57 (9th Cir. 1992). Defendants cannot make such a showing here. \n  Procedurally, plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing by clear and convincing \nevidence that defendants violated a specific and definite order of this Court. See Donovan v. \nMazzola, 716 F.2d 1226, 1240 (9th Cir. 1983). Once that burden is met, the burden shifts to \ndefendants to show that they have taken all reasonable steps to avoid violating that order. Id. \n  In this case, defendants flatly admit that they are repeatedly violating a specific and \ndefinite order of this Court and have been doing so for seven months. Their sworn declarations \nare sufficient proof to show this by clear and convincing evidence. The question, therefore, is \nwhether defendants can prove that they have taken all reasonable steps to avoid violating that \norder. Defendants cannot do so.  \n  The first, and most obvious reasonable step they could have taken to avoid violating this \nCourtโs order would have been to ask this Court to modify its judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(5); Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000) (describing procedures and \nshowing to modify injunction). The failure to attempt that reasonable step should be sufficient to \nPage 7 โPLAINTIFF METROPOLITAN PUBLIC \nDEFENDER SERVICESโS MOTION FOR FINDING OF \nCONTEMPT, TO ALLOW DISCOVERY, AND FOR  \nEXPEDITED HEARING    LEVI MERRITHEW HORST PC \n    610 SW Alder Street, Ste 415 \n    Portland, Oregon 97205  \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00339-MO    Document 85    Filed 05/10/19    Page 8 of 8\n \ndefeat any claim that defendants are not in contempt. If the Court believes that defendants may \nstill be able to prove that they took all reasonable steps, despite their failure to ask the Court to \nmodify the injunction, it should set an expedited contested hearing on this issue. However, what \nis โreasonableโ needs to placed within the context of the seriousness of the injunction.  \n  This Court set an outside limitation of seven days to transport people to OSH because \ndelays of any longer than seven days violate that personโs due process rights. Every single time \nOSH waits more than seven days to transport someone, it is violating the constitution. \nCompliance with the constitution is the first and highest duty of every public official. Every \nother obligation, goal, mandate, or preference is inferior to the obligation to comply with the \nconstitution. Therefore, unless the defendants claim that their decision not to transport people in \ncompliance with this Courtโs injunction is because doing so would violate other constitutional \nobligations they hold, their reasons are insufficient. \nCONCLUSION \n  MPD views defendantsโ contemptuous delays as creating a medical and moral emergency \nfor its clients. As Judge Panner rightly observed, staffing and funding levels simply pale in \ncomparison to the suffering and damage done to a person with untreated mental illness, locked in \na cage for 23 hours a day. MPD implores this Court to act quickly to end the suffering, mitigate \nthe damage, and prevent future violations. \n \nDATED this 10th day of May, 2019.

Submit a progress report to the court and to Plaintiffs every three weeks from the date of\nmy ruling.

Or. Advoc. Ctr. v. Mink, CV No. 02-339, 2002 WL \n35578910, at *7 (D. Or. May 10, 2002); see also Or. Advoc. Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d \n1101, 1105 (9th Cir. 2003).  Those pretrial detainees are known as โ.370 patients.โ1  \nOn April 17, 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, OSH filed a motion in the \ndistrict court seeking a modification of the Mink injunctionโs seven-day deadline \nfor admitting .370 patients until โit is medically safe for OSH to begin accepting \npatients in the normal course again.โ  The district court granted the motion over the \nobjection of Plaintiff Oregon Advocacy Center, which advocates for the rights of \nindividuals with mental illnesses.  This appeal followed.  We vacate and remand.   \nWe review a district courtโs grant of a motion to modify a permanent \ninjunction for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Asarco Inc., 430 F.3d 972, \n978 (9th Cir. 2005).  To prevail in its motion to modify the Mink injunction, OSH \n \n1 Under Oregon law, if a court finds that a defendant is incompetent to stand \ntrial and that he requires a hospital level of care, the court may order that the \ndefendant be committed to OSH.  Or. Rev. Stat. ยง 161.370.  Such orders are known \nas โ.370 orders.โ  \n \n2 \n      \n\n(3 of 9)\nCase: 20-35540, 08/16/2021, ID: 12201953, DktEntry: 44-1, Page 3 of 5\nhad to demonstrate a significant change in factual conditions that made compliance \nwith the injunction โmore onerous, unworkable, or detrimental to the public \ninterest.โ  Id. at 979 (quoting Small v. Hunt, 98 F.3d 789, 795 (4th Cir. 1996)).  If \nOSH made such a showing, the district court could fashion a modification order \nthat was โsuitably tailored to resolve the problems createdโ by the changed factual \nconditions.  Am. Unites for Kids v. Rousseau, 985 F.3d 1075, 1097 (9th Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Asarco, 430 F.3d at 979).  \n1.  OSH met its burden to demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic made \ncompliance with the Mink injunction more onerous.  In response to the pandemic, \nOSH reconfigured units at both of its campuses to allow for isolation of potentially \ninfected patients and protection of high-risk patients.  For new admissions, OSH \nopened two admissions monitoring units, each of which could safely receive \nbetween fifteen and nineteen new .370 patients every two weeks.  Opening those \nunits required transferring patients among units at both campuses, all while \nattempting to prevent an outbreak among the patient population.  Unsurprisingly, \nthis proved burdensome for OSH during the pandemicโs early stages.   \n2.  The district court abused its discretion by failing to issue a modification \norder that was suitably tailored to the factual circumstances.  Citing the district \ncourtโs 2002 order in Mink, Plaintiffs argue that jails cannot provide adequate \nmental health treatment to individuals with .370 orders.  As the district court stated \n3 \n      \n\n(4 of 9)\nCase: 20-35540, 08/16/2021, ID: 12201953, DktEntry: 44-1, Page 4 of 5\nin 2002, โ[d]epriving [individuals with .370 orders] of necessary medical treatment \nincreases the likelihood that they may decompensate and suffer unduly,โ meaning \nthat their conditions may worsen, or they may have difficulty gaining competency.  \nAt the same time, jails primarily employ disciplinary toolsโsuch as solitary \nconfinementโto control inmatesโ behaviors.  These tools are ineffective when \nused to manage people with mental illnesses, and they can be very harmful.  \nIndividuals with .370 orders have a โhigh suicide risk,โ and disciplinary actions \nโexacerbate[] their mental illness.โ  Consequently, according to the district court in \n2002, โ[e]very day of delay in transport harms those found unfit to proceed and \nhampers their ability to defend themselves.โ \nThe district courtโs modification order relaxes the Mink injunctionโs \nmandatory seven-day deadline for OSH to admit .370 patients without imposing \nmeaningful parameters to ensure that the interests of those patients are served to \nthe greatest possible extent.  The modification orderโs only oversight requirements \nare that OSH provide progress reports to the court and to Plaintiffs โevery three \nweeks,โ and that OSH appear at status conferences.2  Although the circumstances \npresented by a new pandemic were certainly challenging, the district court had \nother options available.  For example, the district court could have adopted \n \n2 Although we do not base our holding on events that postdate the district \ncourtโs decision, we note that the courtโs reporting requirements have not been \nconsistently followed.  \n4 \n      \n\n(5 of 9)\nCase: 20-35540, 08/16/2021, ID: 12201953, DktEntry: 44-1, Page 5 of 5\nparameters such as a sunset date after which the order would terminate (thereby \nrequiring a new motion from OSH if it still wanted relief from the seven-day \nrequirement), or it could have imposed a concrete alternative timeline for admitting \nindividuals with .370 orders if seven days proved unworkable, or both.  \nAlternatively, the district court could have ordered the modification to terminate at \nsome date that would be tied to public health policy milestones, such as the lifting \nof Oregonโs State of Emergency. \nTo be sure, the district court faced a difficult task during an unprecedented \ntime.  But an open-ended modification order is inconsistent with the urgent need to \ntransfer individuals with .370 orders out of jails.  The order is thus not โsuitably \ntailoredโ to the factual circumstances.  Rousseau, 985 F.3d at 1097.   \nOn remand, the district court is instructed to reconsider whether a \nmodification to the permanent injunction is needed, and, if so, to craft a more \nโsuitably tailoredโ modification order. Id.; cf. Hook v. Arizona, 120 F.3d 921, 926 \n(9th Cir. 1997).  The examples listed above are not directives; the district court \nshould have the flexibility to conduct further factfinding and consider alternatives \nbefore issuing any further order. \nVACATED AND REMANDED. \n5 \n      \n\n(6 of 9)\nCase: 20-35540, 08/16/2021, ID: 12201953, DktEntry: 44-2, Page 1 of 4\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nOffice of the Clerk \n95 Seventh Street \nSan Francisco, CA 94103 \nInformation Regarding Judgment and Post-Judgment Proceedings \nJudgment \nโข This Court has filed and entered the attached judgment in your case.\nFed.

      "text": "          \n \nD e b r a  A.  P i n a l s,  M. D. \nBoard Certified in Psychiatry, Forensic Psychiatry, and Addiction Medicine \n \nNeutral Expert Second Report \nRegarding the Consolidated Mink and Bowman Cases \n \n \nDate of Report: 6/5/22 \nNeutral Expert: Debra A. Pinals, M.D. \n \nBackground and Context of this Report \nOn 12/21/21, the Honorable Michael W. Mosman, U.S. District Judge for the United States District Court \nfor the District of Oregon, Portland Division, entered an order appointing me, Dr. Debra Pinals, as a \nNeutral Expert in granting a Stipulated Motion from defendants at the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) \nand the Oregon State Hospital (OSH) and Plaintiffs Jarrod Bowman, Joshawn Douglas-Simpson, Disability \nRights Oregon, Metropolitan Public Defender Services, Inc., and A.J. Madison. The Courtโs order \nconsolidates two cases, Bowman et al v. Matteucci et al (Case Number: 3:21-cv-01637-MO) and Oregon \nAdvocacy Center et al v. Mink et al (Case Number: 3:02-cv-00339-MO) and identifies Mink as the lead \ncase. Through this consolidation, the Bowman case was reassigned from the Honorable Marco A. \nHernandez to Judge Mosman. \n \nJudge Mosmanโs order stipulates further that OHA enter into a contract with the Neutral Expert and \nprovide any needed information to her.  Further, the Court ordered that the Neutral Expert should \nโmake recommendations to address capacity issues at the Oregon State Hospital.โ The order delineates \nthat the first report from the Neutral Expert, due 1/31/22, shall include โsuggested admissions protocol \nthat addresses the admission of patients found unable to aid and assist in their own defense under ORS \n161.370 (.370 patients) as well as patients found to be Guilty Except for Insanity (GEI patients).โ  The \nCourt further ordered a second report by the Neutral Expert, due by 4/29/22 that should include โa \nshort report and recommendations for a proposed long-term compliance plan for OSH.โ  In conducting \nthe activities needed to form recommendations, I sought and received an extension of the due date of \nthis Second Report.  \n \nThis report represents the Second Report of the appointed Neutral Expert in this matter.  \nBackground and Summary of the Two Consolidated Cases \nIn 2002, Oregon Advocacy Center, now known as Disability Rights Oregon (DRO) filed a civil rights \nlawsuit against the state of Oregon alleging that the state was failing to timely admit individuals found \nincompetent to stand trial (Unable to Aid and Assist) who were ordered to Oregon State Hospital (OSH) \nfor competence to stand trial restoration. The ruling out of the Ninth Circuit (OAC v. Mink) found on \nbehalf of plaintiffs that the State was out of compliance and must admit these individuals within seven \n(7) days. In June 2019, after the State had fallen out of compliance, the Court compelled the state to get \nin compliance with Mink within 90 days.  Although the State met its burden at the time, compliance with \nbecame challenging once again with the pandemic creating other barriers. The State filed a motion \nrequesting greater latitude in admitting individuals found Unable to Aid and Assist to mitigate the \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nspread of COVID-19. That motion was granted, and DRO appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThe Ninth Circuit issued an order vacating the modification but also sought review by the District Court \nJudge. In December 2021, the parties entered an interim settlement agreement that involved the \nappointment of a Neutral Expert to provide recommendations. \nIn November 2021, plaintiffs Jarod Bowman and Joshawn Douglas-Simpson brought action against the \nOSH and Oregon Health Authority (OHA) (plaintiffs were later joined by Metropolitan Public Defender) \nfor failure to timely admit these individuals adjudicated Guilty Except for Insanity (GEI) by the \nMultnomah County Circuit Court, after the Honorable Nan Waller had ordered them to OSH for \ntreatment, without unreasonable delay. The plaintiffs remained, however at the Multnomah County \nDetention Center for months (Plaintiff Bowman for nearly eight months, and Plaintiff Douglas-Simpson \nfor nearly six months) after the commitment order was issued. Plaintiffs alleged a violation of their \nsubstantive due process rights and filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order asking for plaintiffs \nto be transported to OSH within seven days of the order. The defendants argued that a lack of space at \nOSH, in part related to the need to timely admit individuals in the Aid and Assist process, contributed to \nthe delays in admitting the patients. The Court granted the plaintiffsโ motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order, noting that โThe Mink injunction does not address the relative priority of aid-and-\nassist patients and GEI patientsโฆโ noting that โany prioritization stems from Defendantโs failure to \nprovide the funds, staff, and facilities necessary to satisfy the constitutional rights of both groups. When \nsatisfying constitutional guarantees, Defendants cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.โ In that opinion, The \nHonorable Marco A. Hernandez, United States District Court Judge, did agree with the defendants that a \nconsolidation of the Mink and Bowman cases may make sense. As noted above, after the decision about \nthe Temporary Restraining Order regarding the two specific plaintiffs, and at the time of the \nappointment of the Neutral Expert, the parties entered an interim agreement that no individuals found \nGEI would wait longer than four months for admission to OSH.  \nQualifications to Perform this Consultation \nMy qualifications to render opinions as the Neutral Expert were described in my first report. In summary \nof that experience, I have worked for almost twenty-five years as a clinical and academic and forensic \npsychiatrist, and over twenty years functioning in state and local level administrative leadership, \nmanagement, policy development, clinical treatment, forensic evaluation, and consultative roles across \nseveral U.S. jurisdictions.  \nSources \nTo help inform the recommendations contained in this report, I reviewed numerous documents that \nwere received since the production of my First Neutral Expert Report. I reviewed additional \ndocumentation/correspondence periodically from the Parties related to areas they each brought to my \nattention. I received miscellaneous correspondence from interested parties, often with rich information \nand perspectives regarding Oregonโs history related to this matter. In addition, I also saw news outlet \ncoverage of this matter from time to time. These various categories of items are not specifically \ndelineated below as sources. Also, some items may have been inadvertently omitted. Apart from those \ncaveats, to understand the scope of my activities, documents I reviewed include the following: \n1.

I am appreciative of the communityโs investment in \nthese discussions to help facilitate my work in this matter. \nGlossary of Acronyms and Terms Used in this and Prior Reports \nA&A or AA: Aid and Assist \nCCOs: Coordinated Care Organizations \nCCBHCs: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics \nCFAA: County Financial Assistance Agreements \nCMHPs: Community Mental Health Programs \nDOJ: Department of Justice Oregon \nDRO: Disability Rights Oregon \nGEI: Guilty Except for Insanity \nHLOC: Hospital Level of Care \nIMPACTS: Improving Peopleโs Access to Community-Based Treatment, Supports, and Services \nMOOVRS: Multi-Occupancy OSH Vacancy Resource & System Improvement Team \nMPD: Metropolitan Public Defender \nOHA: Oregon Health Authority  \nOSH: Oregon State Hospital  \nPSRB: Psychiatric Security Review Board \nSHRP: State Hospital Review Panel \nSRTF: Secure Residential Treatment Facility \nSummary of Activities Since the First Neutral Expert Report \nFollowing the issuance of my First Report, the State and the plaintiffs met regularly discussing the \nimplementation of my initial recommendations, and the State continued to produce a monthly progress \nreport to me in this matter. I testified in front of two subcommittees of the Oregon Legislature to help \nexplain my recommendations.   \nThe OSH team worked diligently to begin crafting a data dashboard in consultation with the Neutral \nExpert that was developed and has been released monthly since April. The Social Work department at \nOSH began working on their process map related to discharges and improving efficiencies when feasible. \nMultiple meetings with OSH and social work services were held to review updates to discharge process \nmap and seek input from stakeholders. OSH leadership reviewed with me their work admitting a \nsignificant number of patients after the pause in admissions due to COVID-19 and opened their Junction \nCity unit.  I had a preliminary meeting with leadership from the Oregon Developmental Disability \nServices to discuss the AA population. Their office had not been directly involved with the \nMink/Bowman matters to date. This is a conversation that will be important to continue. \n7 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nAn RFA for $15M dollars was released and responses received from the communities in the interim since \nmy First Report. I have had an opportunity to review the RFA as well as the early responses. This work \nwill help provide critical infrastructure focused specifically on the AA population. State concerns that the \nmoney be allocated for specific activities that would yield a reduction in jail wait times was clear.  \nIn regular meetings with the parties, both plaintiffs and the State expressed an urgency related to the \nMink/Bowman matters. Issues and concerns arose about whether residential bed numbers had \ndecreased, and there was also recognition of significant staffing shortages across both hospital and \ncommunity systems in the context of COVID-19. OSH had maximized admissions with its Junction City \nUnit opening but demand for evaluations continued to be high. I met with several individuals pertaining \nto contempt hearings against OSH for failure to timely admit AA defendants, which were taking time \naway from clinical services, and reviewed related data. This was useful in that it demonstrated that \ncontempt hearings created significant work despite data showing they did not necessarily expedite \nadmissions. This information was shared with stakeholders.  \nIn keeping with my work on this case, I had asked that recommendations be mutually crafted with input \nfrom the parties. This created a need for multiple meetings to review ideas for specificity, feasibility, and \nconsideration of their potential ultimate yield.  As a group there was consensus that any \nrecommendations should be made to maximize achievement of compliance with Mink/Bowman \nspecifically, rather than focus on system improvements broadly. To that end, many discussions took \nplace with challenging but earnest participation. In my opinion the discussions were productive and \nhelped shape the recommendations outlined below. Furthermore, over the course of my work I made \nseveral data requests and include data below to help inform the Court about my recommendations.  \nData Summaries: \nBackground Data: According to data received (See Figure 1 and Table 1), there is progress in terms of \noverall numbers of people waiting from the time of the First Expert report, but a recent upward trend \n(after a downward trend) in days waited and numbers waiting.  There appears to be more gains for the \nGEI population than for the AA population.  Also, the census of OSH is nearly at capacity (See Table 2 \nand Table 3) with about vacancies related to emergency bed need planning (generally one bed held \nopen on each unit to allow for safety and planning for unexpected issues). Also, the numbers of \nindividuals determined by the hospital to not need hospital level of care outnumber those awaiting \nadmission (see Figure 1 and Table 4).  \nRegarding the demand for admissions, A&A orders continue to increase (see Table 4 and Figure 2). \nBecause of that metric, it is important to recognize that the rise in admissions reflects improvements in \ndischarge processes. As noted in Figure 1, days waiting to discharge have decreased slightly, and the \nstate is to be commended, along with the community, for all efforts to discharge individuals who do not \nneed hospital level of care. This work needs to continue, given patient needs and the Olmstead decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nFigure 1.

Also, patients return multiple times as seen in \nTables 6 and 7.  In an email correspondence with OJDโs Mr. Christopher Hamilton, he summarized the \nfindings as follows \nโข  58.7% (401) of the current OSH census are aid & assist defendants \nโข  41.6% (167) of the current aid & assist defendants have been admitted to OSH previously \nโข  55% (92) of the 167 current aid & assist defendants have been admitted to OSH two or \nmore times \nโข  11.4% (19) of the 167 current aid & assist defendants have been admitted to OSH five or \nmore times \nFigure 3.

From \n5/28/20 to 2/14/22, there were 93 cases that were ultimately contested.  \nโข  The bulk of the cases that are contested were \"able\" findings at 55 out of 93.  \nโข  Most of the contested cases resulted in the same finding that OSH made, at 72 out of 85 (which \nis about 85%) that were determined of those for which information was known. \nFrom 5/26/20 to 5/26/22, there were 965 OSH patients clinically opined as โableโ, and 55 patients for \nwhom this opinion was contested, accounting for 3,301 bed days. This number of bed days compares to \nadmitting almost 14 additional AA patients per year based on an average length of stay of 120 days.  \nDemographic and Clinical Data: Data was examined related to those individuals in forensic process that \nhave intellectual and/or other developmental disability disorders (I/DD) based on a point in time from \nOSH from 4/21/22 and an informal survey of community restoration providers regarding services from \nOctober to December 2021 (see Table 8). The OSH numbers do not account for any people who might \nqualify for DD services but had not been enrolled in them, and the community restoration participant \nnumbers do not have a specific metric that was used to identify who had IDD needs (e.g., enrolled in DD \nservices).  Still, the informal poll of community restoration providers showed that several communities \nwere working with individuals with I/DD needs, such as Benton County were three (3) out of four (4) \npeople were identified as IDD. Overall, these data are worth noting in that there may be more of these \nindividuals in the community, in CMHP systems not equipped or financed to support their needs and \nmay limit how many people can be served in community restoration. Also, even the small numbers in \nthe hospital may create challenges for the hospital that is not designed to provide habilitation supports \nfor individuals with these needs, which may delay discharge access.  \nTable 8.

Distribution of Aid & Assist Length of Stay for OSH Over 10 Years\n \n \nBased on the data of OSH length of stay over the last 10 years, according to OSH, the following points \nare relevant for a six (6) month time maximum frame for restoration: \nโข  Since 2012, 15.5% (909) of Aid & Assist patients stayed longer than six months (180 days) \nโข  These 909 patients accounted for 321,375 inpatient bed days over the 10+ year period \nโข  Had those patients been limited to six (6) months of restoration services, it could have made \navailable roughly 40 additional beds per year, which could have allowed OSH to serve \nroughly 130 additional patients annually and freed up resources spent on re-evaluation and \nrestoration to be allocated elsewhere. \n \nBased on the data of OSH length of stay over the last 10 years, according to OSH, the following points \nare relevant for a one-year maximum frame for restoration: \n \nโข  Since 2012, 3.7% (215) of Aid & Assist patients stayed longer than 365 days for all charge \ntypes \nโข  These 215 patients accounted for 122,286 inpatient bed days over the 10+ year period \nโข  Had those patients been limited to one year of restoration services, it could have made \navailable roughly 12 additional beds per year, which could have allowed OSH to serve \nroughly 36 additional patients annually and freed up resources spent on re-evaluation and \nrestoration to be allocated elsewhere. \n13 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nReview of other state statutes: To form my opinions and recommendations, I reviewed statutes from \nmultiple states and a summary of state restoration statutes published in Journal of the American \nAcademy of Psychiatry and the Law. Although data from statutes is difficult to depict in a figure, OHA \nstaff assisted me in producing this summary, which I refer to in my recommendations. \nFigure 5. Sample State Statutes and Maximum Time Allotted for Inpatient Restoration \n \n \n \nGeneral Background Information  \nIn order to inform my opinions, as noted above I met with several individuals across numerous \nmeetings. Information gathered from these discussions is summarized below. \nMeetings with CMHP Representatives: \nI had the opportunity to meet with several CMHP leaders and representatives. Themes that they \ndiscussed included: \nโข  Concerns with individuals in the AA system and their level of clinical acuity \nโข  Concerns about the state getting the dollars received to the community \nโข  Many people in the AA system have co-occurring substance use disorders that are not fully \naddressed, and there was worry as to whether Measure 110 would help \nโข  Funding not seeming to keep pace with the needs  \nโข  Housing capacity is limited, houseless population has grown \nโข  There seem to be long waits for SRTF level of care, and a need for secure beds as the courts ask \nfor these \nโข  Secure residential bed capacity decreased during the pandemic, potentially due to pay structure \nand workforce along with other pressures \nโข  Enormous workforce challenges at all levels in the context of the pandemicโs impacts  \n14 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nโข  Liability concerns are high with regard to dealing with high-risk clients.  \nโข  Commitment laws are not as effective and may have over-corrected toward autonomy over \nhelping people who need care get care \nโข  Hard to explain the increase numbers of AA referrals, methamphetamine psychosis may play a \nrole \nโข  Not as many funded services for prevention \nโข  Need more services attached to the AA population with specific models \nโข  Need for more peer support  \nโข  Lack of clarity regarding community restoration including and what it means, what to do with \nsomeone who is not participating and there were problems with the lack of time limits \nโข  There is often a disconnect between courts and CMHPs on whether an individual needs a secure \nplacement, with courts erring more toward ordering confined settings \nโข  Basic structures related to municipal courts can become an issue with the use of the AA process \nwhen alternatives might be reasonable clinically, or when housing is a need   \nIn many of my conversations, I heard about innovations, efforts to establish more options for placement \nand housing, and outreach to courts. For example, at Klamath Basin and old hotel had been purchased \nto help house individuals who had criminal justice and behavioral health histories. More counties were \naccessing the Northwest Regional Reentry Center and seeing that as a positive option. The counties \nwere eager to see how the request for a Medicaid 1115 waiver would help further their abilities to cover \nthe costs of supporting individuals with complex needs. However, concerns were raised that there is a \nnarrative that the counties do not care as much about people being left in the hospital, despite their \nsense that CMHPs are working hard with limited options and a higher risk population who is not always \nengaged in treatment. Also, many people with whom I spoke indicated that financial risk sharing should \nnot be carried only by the CMHPs as there was a role for the CCOs and counties as well, and the \nstructures made accountability complicated. I spoke to leadership in Deschutes and Klamath Basin \nBehavioral Health and other counties about the Certified Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model \n(currently available in limited places). The individuals with whom I spoke indicated it offered promise of \nincreased flexibility and a funding mechanism to help with the more complicated populations at risk of \ncriminal involvement. There were significant concerns that the increased dollars allocated by the \nlegislature had not yet reached the community, though there was hope for this to help.  \nInformation Gathered from CCOs: \nIn April I met with several CCO directors along with OHA staff. The CCO directors indicated that there \nwere many good things happening in Oregon and that relationships with CMHPs were growing. They \nstated that there were activities to grow ACT, FACT, and other wrap around service models. They note \nthere had been a shift for OSH to become more forensic, leaving a civil commitment population with \nlittle access to the hospital. In addition, comments included: \nโข  Some people at OSH who would not meet medical necessity for hospitalization.  \nโข  There is no end date for community restoration \nโข  Housing is separate from health benefits and housing solutions are needed for the population \nโข  Certain community homes were closing because they could not pay the bills \nโข  Comagine plays a role separate from CCOs \nโข  Social Determinants of Health are important to consider in developing support models \n15 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nโข  The carve out for residential settings can create barriers to accessing various levels of care \nโข  CCBHCs and behavioral health homes are promising models \nโข  More dedicated programs or a risk pool approach might be helpful, as well as braided funding to \nhelp support their complex needs  \nโข  An increase rate category for more care coordination would be important for the AA population \nJail Diversion and Community Restoration Provider Information: \nIn early March I met with about 42 staff who came to a meeting organized by OHAโs Cody Gabel. The \nstaff were from all over the state and the discussion was lively. They were invited as providers of jail \ndiversion and AA community restoration services. Over the course of my meetings, I heard from other \nstakeholders who provided similar input. There were several themes that emerged from these \nconversations summarized here:  \nโข  Lack of community options and having information like a bed board might be helpful \nโข  Job responsibilities that span multiple functions (e.g., crisis clinician, jail diversion, consultation \nand AA coordinator potentially performed by one person) \nโข  Limited resources for PSRB populations in the community.  \nโข  Much demand for โsecureโ placements \nโข  Many of the people in community restoration have IDD needs and the providers expressed \noften feeling ill-equipped to work with that population \nโข  High rates of co-occurring substance use disorders \nโข  Workforce shortages increasing strain on providers \nโข  COVID-19 impacts still making service provision difficult \nโข  Northwest Regional Reentry Center provides a good resource \nโข  Post resolution of AA processes, there seems to be a gap with limited help for these individuals \nas they transition out of the AA system  \nโข  Individuals often push back on learning legal skills and counties handle the restoration work \ndifferently \nโข  High levels of trauma for the AA population \nโข  Having rapid evaluations statewide might help with demand \nPerspectives of Two Patients at OSH \nI met with two patients who asked to speak with me regarding OSH. Both patients were involved in the \nGEI process and under the PSRB authority. Both had been brought back into OSH after revocations of \nconditional release. Both explained that there had been discrepancies in diagnoses and determinations \nof what level of care was needed. Themes that emerged in these conversations were: \nโข  Concerns that treatment teams are not pursuing discharge because of โanticipatingโ the \noutcome from the PSRB \nโข  Concerns that the PSRB has made decisions that are conservative in nature  \nโข  Concerns that their term under the PSRB at the outset was arranged as the maximum period \npossible (One individual said, โit takes hope off the tableโ reducing motivation to do well) \nโข  PSRB services with the community are more positive, people are given multiple chances with \nrelapse and recovery \n16 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nโข  Long waitlists for community placements- one individual stated he had been accepted in two \ndifferent community settings but neither has a bed until 2023 \nโข  Need for greater coordination between the hospital and the community \nโข  Limited evidence was reviewed for the revocation \nโข  Complex diagnostic issues may warrant further analyses (both patients were not being \nprescribed medications with no apparent psychotic symptoms, though no formal assessment \nwas conducted. They indicated drug-induced psychosis may have been relevant to their stories \nPeer and Family Support Perspectives: \nOn 4/13/22 a meeting of about 29 people took place focused on hearing the perspectives of peers and \nfamily supports.  The conversation involved robust participation, and there seemed to be good \ngeographic representation. The group was very appreciative of the meeting, and it was also very helpful \nto me to hear their perspectives. Though much was discussed, some of the themes included the \nfollowing: \nโข  Attorneys try their best to represent rights of individuals but may decide what is best for them, \nand there should be a way to have the individual voices heard more \nโข  There is a need for more support services, more peer supports for individuals in the AA process \nโข  There is a need for warm handoffs and continuity of care for people leaving OSH \nโข  Continuity of care across systems and locations is a challenge, and getting to know people, their \nlegal case, and required timelines from the courts, before they leave OSH could help \nโข  Communities are understaffed so participation in supporting individuals upon return to the \ncommunity is limited at times \nโข  Increased capacity to serve and house people found GEI is needed \nโข  Peers are starting to get more involved, but more should be built into systems \nโข  The Directive for Mental Health treatment is an avenue to help people be more engaged in their \nown care, but needs to be more broadly discussed, but there are limits in certain settings \nPSRB Perspectives: \nSeveral meetings took place related to PSRB specific matters. Dr. Bort helped provide an overview to \nPSRB processes and updated protocols to OHA and OSH leadership and to me. She noted that the \nphilosophy of the PSRB has been increasingly about helping individuals move from more to less \nrestrictive settings. Dr. Bort noted several impediments to helping expedite discharges, though she \nacknowledged that many of the time issues are related to statutes and requirements for notice and the \nlike. She explained that the hearings required of the PSRB occur timely though there was a public \nperception of delays, she felt that the statutory requirements were being followed. That said, \nimpediments were identified related to getting community evaluation appointments and finding \nresidential vacancies suitable for the PSRB client needs. There was also recognition that some of the \nrequirements related to conditional release and risk review could benefit from updates.  \nLegislative Perspectives: \nOregonโs legislative interest in behavioral health is a major strength that was apparent in many of my \nmeetings. Many of the legislative staff I spoke with had worked in roles that related to the behavioral \n17 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nhealth system and were quite knowledgeable, which was another strength I noted. In speaking to them \nindividually and listening to broader group meetings and discussions, questions about transparency of \nstate spending were raised. There was concern that additional dollars requested would not take into \naccount dollars already allocated. Below I discuss how the state responded to a recommendation \nrelated to the transparency of funding utilization. Other issues that came up in my conversations with \nlegislative representatives included a desire to better clarify overall responsibility and accountability, as \nfunding structures between CCOs, CMHPs, counties, and the County Financial Assistance Award (CFAA) \nmechanics.  There was a plan for ongoing conversation with OHA leadership to examine these issues. \nThe legislative presiding officers have also convened a workgroup that would examine the needs of the \nโcommittedโ populations including AA, GEI, and civil commitments. I was able to participate in some of \nthese meetings and observed a serious review of barriers support and reduce the AA population. \nDefense Attorneys Perspectives: \nThe defense attorneys with whom I spoke described cases where their perseverance and efforts to \nidentify what might make positive outcomes for their clients came through quite clearly. They provided \nperspectives however that there were limited resources in the system, that the community restoration \nhad no timelines making it hard to justify for their clients in many cases, and concerns that the \nadmissions list at OSH requires contempt filings to ensure their clientsโ timely access. There was much \ndiscussion about this, and we discussed data from the State showing that the individuals are largely \nadmitted by virtue of the waitlist movement that moves faster than court contempt proceedings.  \nConcerns were raised about challenges with accessing diversion, alternative pathways or even dismissals \nfor AA defendants, especially those that cycle through the criminal system.  \nProsecution Perspectives: \nI heard perspectives in the AA workgroups and in some discussion with prosecution attorneys. It is \ncommendable to see the level of engagement in the system-wide conversations from the prosecution. I \nfocused some discussions on restoration services. In discussing my preliminary recommendation to \nshorten timeframes for restoration, the prosecution registered opposition. Concerns were raised \nespecially related to individuals with charges pertaining to violent crimes, and as such, \nrecommendations provide some options for longer restoration for certain individuals.  \nMunicipal Court Perspectives: \nIn my conversation with Judge Gill from Eugene Municipal Court, he described how the municipal courts \ndo not have the same structure as OJD. He indicated feeling staffed with compassionate and capable \npeople who daily work with community issues. He manages a well-established local mental health court. \nHe described that he works hard to help the parties in matters identify community solutions, and that \nOSH is needed still for some of the sickest people. He noted that restoration in the community has been \ndifficult and that there is little data related to outcomes. Although he recognized that Lane County seeks \nbeds at OSH, he was concerned on what might happen if misdemeanant defendants were not able to \naccess OSH. He described his willingness to partner with stakeholders to be part of any solutions.  \n \n \n18 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nOJD Perspectives: \nRegular meetings with OJD and the Parties provided opportunities to share updated information about \nrespective AA-related activities. Several conversations resulted in educational and informational \nmemoranda to be written for OJD judges statewide. I had the opportunity to verbally review my \npreliminary recommendations and refine them based on OJD input. OJD has also been taking on, with \ntechnical assistance from the SAMHSA GAINS Center, discussions about evaluation processes in Oregon \nto help make improvements and gain efficiencies. This is consistent with my First Report and will be \nfurther delineated below. The leadership at OJD is to be commended for its efforts in data collection, \ndeveloping innovations and working to help resolve the waitlist issues in partnership with the parties. \nComments on Specific Areas of Focus \nBed Board and Bed Access: Several conversations related to limited capacity to access beds, and \nchallenges with the Comagine services in authorizing residential bed access. Work being done on a bed \nโregistryโ was authorized through Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and is a project that is \nunderway. Individuals at the state indicated that lessons learned through COVID revealed that knowing \nwhere โopen bedsโ are in the system was not as straightforward as there could be numerous variables \nthat might make an open bed not available (staffing, infrastructure, acuity). There was discussion with \nthe parties also that ongoing work with the Intensive Services Unit might facilitate further discussions \nabout how to improve information about beds in the community system. \nMultnomah County Pilot Initiative Initial Meeting 2/22/22 and follow Up: Under the auspices of the \ninterim Settlement Agreement there was discussion regarding specific work in Multnomah County. \nThrough discussions with the parties and with OJD, it was determined that the County and Judge Waller \nwould initiate a review of individuals in the jail who had mental health needs eligible for diversion, with \na specific focus on the AA population. Some of the model was gleaned from a prior trip that \nstakeholders had looking at the Arizona system. Since the first meeting 2/22/22, there were several \nfollow up meetings that appeared to foster ongoing discussion and collaboration. In conversation with \nOJD and Judge Waller as well as staff at DRO, these meetings seemed to bring the right partners to the \ntable and allow for dialogue and improved understanding of various perspectives. This pilot was seen as \na very beginning effort that would have promise to help find alternative pathways for those individuals \nwaiting for AA processes or impacted by them. \nInformation Gathered Related to County Risk Sharing Proposal:  In my First Report, I made a \nrecommendation for county financial risk sharing, with legislative proposal to allow charging counties \nfor patients who no longer require hospital level of care on the OSH 9b list beyond a date threshold.  \nThere was a great deal of discussion and concern about this recommendation. As noted below, based on \nfeedback received, this recommendation was ultimately modified with extensive discussion with the \nparties who agreed with the shift.   \nInformation from Progress Reports to the Neutral Expert \nI received pursuant to the Courtโs order, monthly progress reports from the State from February \nthrough June regarding actions taken to address issues pertaining to Mink/Bowman compliance. The \nfollowing summarizes elements of information from those reports: \n19 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nโข  Opening Junction City second unit on 2/1/22 \nโข  Proposed legislation by OHA allowing for charging counties for patients who no longer require \nHLOC and are on the Ready-to-Place list proposed but not entered into budget note \nโข  Planning for the spending of $130M in investments from the 2021 Legislature  \nโข  IMPACTS grants working to launch second grant cycle \nโข  Added six (6) positions to the OHA Intensive Services Unit \nโข  CCBHC received $121M in total funds  \nโข  DOJ worked with state courts to help support the discharge processes required by SB 295  \nโข  Data dashboard developed  \nโข  OSH and OHA began work reviewing and improving discharge processes, and expanding use of \nNWRRC \nโข  Focused effort to build out the 988 crisis system recognizing the new three-digit phone \nnumberโ988โwill be available on 7/16/22 \nโข  OHA planning to restructure County Financial Assistance Agreements (CFAA) and complete a \nresearch study to better understand increases in AA referrals was underway \nโข  CMHP Funding RFA for FY 2023 developed, with planned distribution of funds around 7/1/22 \nโข  OHAโs Intensive Services Unit hired all open positions \nโข  DOJ general counsel coordination in GEI cases where community evaluations were not orders \nโข  Increased coordination for people on the Ready to Place List between HSD staff and OSH in \ncoordination with CMHPs \nโข  Expansion of Lane County Contract for SRTF beds on the grounds of Junction City Campus \nโข  OSH received legislative approval for 228 budgeted positions and $10.8M, including position \nauthority for 134 unbudgeted FTE and 94 new positions \nโข  Ongoing work with the legislature regarding provider rate issues and behavioral health \nworkforce stabilization \nโข  Re-opening of IMPACTS grants \nโข  RFA posted to OregonBuys on 3/18/22, and RFA applications currently under review \nโข  CCBHC state infrastructure hired, planning underway to achieve focused work on AA population \nโข  Development of meetings with 911 PSAP and new rules pertaining to 988 \nโข  Ongoing work regarding SB 295 adherence \nโข  Contract with Lane County signed and in effect to expand SRTF bed capacity in that area \nโข  Resuming meetings to examine CFAA increased accountability \nโข  Ongoing efforts with OHA, OSH, DOJ working on discharge processes  \nโข  Multnomah County โjail reviewโ meetings established bi-monthly with OHA engagement \nBarriers initially identified included ongoing challenges with COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, leading \nto some earlier pauses in admissions at OHA. There were also initial concerns about whether counties \nand providers would bid for the funding opportunities given concerns about expanding in light of \nstaffing crises and COVID-related issues as well as residential rates.  \nRecommendations and Comments: \nAs described above, the parties worked diligently with me to discuss various strategies to achieve \ncompliance with the 7-day admission requirement of Mink as soon as possible, and the need of the GEI \npatients to be similarly released from jail and timely admitted. There was discussion about โbreak-the- \nglassโ ideas, but even those were recognized to potentially have unintended consequences for certain \n20 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \npopulations. Tragically, a death in jail of an individual on the admissions list occurred during the interim \nperiod between the First and this Second Report. Although the circumstances of that death are being \nexamined separately, all parties recognize the critical need to maximize access to the hospital when \nneeded, but everyone with whom I spoke recognized that there is no simple single solution that will fix \nthe issues that are contributing to the increased referrals to OSH and difficulties with discharges that \ncreates ongoing barriers to opening space at OSH for those waiting in jails and other places. The below \nrecommendations are set forth with this in mind, to address, per Judge Mosmanโs order, both capacity \nissues at OSH and admissions protocols. \nI.  State Level Data and Process Improvements \nIn this first section, I outline priority activities that I recommend be taken that are largely within the \npurview of OHA/OSH or the Plaintiffs and would not require legislative changes.  \nA.  Data and Information Sharing with Stakeholders \nConsistent with my recommendation in January 2022 to โdevelop data infrastructure,โ and use data \nto help achieve compliance, the following recommendations pertain to this data development and \ninformation sharing: \n1.  Enhanced utilization of data dashboard: OSH provided the first data dashboard for this \nmatter in April 2022, and monthly thereafter.  To understand trendlines, it will be helpful to \nproduce these dashboards twice per month, and this should begin by August 2022. Future \ndashboards should be distributed twice per month to a distribution list consisting of the \nNeutral Expert, OHA, DOJ, DRO, MPD, OJD, CMHP directors, Coordinated Care Organizations \n(CCOs), PSRB leadership, and other stakeholders who have requested this information or are \nnewly identified by the Parties.  OHAโs Intensive Services Unit should also distribute this \ndata dashboard twice monthly to their Aid and Assist and PSRB contact lists. By the end of \nJune 2022, OHA, DRO, and MPD should begin to engage with stakeholders to review this \ndata and develop a process to best use this data to inform system change at local levels.  \n \n2.  Consideration of additional staff for data development: If expansion of data development is \nneeded OHA should seek to add an additional Data Technician, through the development of \na Policy Option Package (POP) to be submitted to the legislature or any means available. \n \n3.  Partnering with OJD around data: OHA/OSH should work in partnership with OJD to \nexamine best mechanisms to share their own data and utilize regular data reports from each \nentity to mutually inform practices.  \n \n4.  Development of website: As soon as feasible, OHA/OSH should develop a public facing \nMink/Bowman website to inform stakeholders and provide public access to items such as \nrelated Federal Court Orders related to this matter, settlement agreements, public reports, \nlegislative testimony, identified key relevant policies, funding opportunities, notices of open \nmeetings, and the distributed data dashboard reports, and any other information that \nwould help stakeholders understand this matter and progress toward compliance. \n21 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \n \nB.  Streamlining and Improving Processes and Contract Revisions \n \n1.  Review of discharge assessment processes: In April 2022, OHA/OSH began reviewing โlocus \nscoresโ and how level of care determinations are made for patients on the Ready-to-Place \nwait list. Starting in June 2022, OHA/OSH will work with consultation of the Neutral Expert \nto develop standardized assessment processes that support level of care determinations \nwithout over-reliance on a single score. By August 2022, OHA should convene key partners \nto review the standardized assessment process and make any final recommendations that \nwill lead to consistent and transparent placement decisions.  Rule changes shall occur as \nneeded. Input from individuals with lived experience would be helpful in this review. \n \n2.  Shift of court notification practice: By June 2022, OHA should re-establish prior policy and \ndischarge .370 defendants back to the committing county upon a forensic evaluation of \nโable.โ  For now, those individuals opined as โnever able,โ or โmed neverโ should be further \nstudied for potential process change to support direct community discharge, if clinically \nappropriate, with CMHP assistance rather than routing back to jail. This will require further \ndiscussion. For those individuals for whom an evaluator opines they are โableโ OHA should \nstop its temporary policy established during the pandemic of keeping defendants up to 30 \ndays past the evaluation where a party has contested that finding. This has contributed to \nextended lengths of stay for many individuals. Although it is understood that the official \nfinding is based on an adjudication, for most cases as noted in the data above, when there \nare external evaluations, they agree with the original forensic review.  \n \nI have been told that there may be legal arguments against this recommendation. However, \nfor compliance with Mink to be achieved, the hospital must look to practices that impede \naccess, and this notice to the courts appeared in my review to be one of them in that it \nincreases length of stay beyond clinical recommendations for individuals clinically thought \nto have improved sufficiently to be able to Aid and Assist in their defense. When state \nhospitals have discharge processes controlled by courts, there is a risk of challenges by \nregulatory bodies examining medical necessity of services, given that hospitals require \nmedical staff to make discharge decisions on clinical grounds. With that in mind, I \nrecommend that OSH revert in part to its long practice in place prior to the pandemic, which \nis anticipated to allow for additional bed space to become available on an ongoing basis. \n  \n3.  Clinical reviews of utilization of OSH beds: By July 1, 2022, OSH should develop plans for \nprioritization of a) early referrals for evaluations of persons in Aid and Assist process at OSH \nto re-examine their competence to stand trial; and b) earlier reviews for Hospital Level of \nCare (HLOC) determinations for AA patients at OSH to clinically determine readiness for \nstepdown or discharge as early as possible, with implementation of both these plans as \nexpeditiously as possible. \n \n4.  Multidisciplinary training related to AA and misdemeanants: By July 1, 2022, plaintiffs should \ndevelop a plan presented to the Neutral Expert working in partnership with OJD and other \n22 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nstakeholders, and OHA should collaborate on this, to develop multidisciplinary education for \ndefense, prosecution and judiciary regarding the importance of maximizing the use of \ndiversion from Aid and Assist processes for any defendant for misdemeanant defendants \nand for those defendants for whom prosecution is not likely to be pursued.  Training should \nalso include information about accessing and prioritizing community restoration for those \nthat cannot be diverted from criminal case processing and can meet the criteria for such \nservices in the community. The work between DRO plaintiffs and OHA should not be \nconstrued to undercut plaintiffโs independence and legally mandated role. \n \n5.  Coordination with ODDS: By July 1 2022, OHA, OSH and the Office of Developmental \nDisability Services (ODDS) should meet to review the Mink/Bowman case to determine \nwhere there may be needed improvements for timely discharge from OSH and diversion for \nindividuals with IDD in the Aid and Assist and GEI processes to appropriate community \nalternatives in lieu of OSH admission where feasible, as well as explore community \nrestoration support opportunities for clients eligible for DD services. \n \n6.  Development of community navigator model: Data from OSH discharges indicates that \nrecidivism rates (defined as return to OSH) are highest for the people who were admitted in \nthe Aid and Assist system (See again Figure 3, Tables 6 and 7).  To help offset this risk of \nrecidivism and sustain compliance, OHA in coordination with stakeholders and in \nconsultation with the Neutral Expert should develop a model to create โcommunity \nnavigatorsโ to support individuals sent for restoration as they transition from OSH into \ncommunity settings. Model development should begin in July 2022 with expected design for \na pilot model by December 2022, which will then inform a mechanism for establishment of \nthe pilot implementation date. Elements of this model should include:  \n \na.  New, focused navigators to support individuals who were ordered for Aid and Assist \nrestoration at OSH and in the community, and to connect with those hospitalized prior \nto discharge, and to continue to work with them for no less than six months most \ndischarge and three months after community restoration has ended. The goal of the \nnavigators would be to provide support and reduce recidivism into the Aid and Assist \nsystems. \nb.  Implementation of augmented transitional support structures to help individuals stay \nconnected to services after their involvement with the Aid and Assist processes. This \nservice should leverage existing potential resources, such as might be available through \nCCOs and ACT services or other supports that can be expanded with this targeted \napproach. \nc.  Use of evidence-informed practices and other state examples of similar services to help \ninform best available approaches. \nd.  Engagement of peer supports as part of the model. \ne.  Inclusion of elements of data tracking for evaluation purposes including an examination \nof recidivism to OSH for Aid and Assist restoration.   \nf.  Establishment of a clear organizational structure with regard to management, data \ncollection, accountability, and oversight. \n23 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \n7.  Consultation/Expedited admission and diversion processes: Enhance existing Mink/Bowman \nConsultation/Expedited Admission Service and support opportunities for early diversion from \nOSH for individuals Awaiting Admission to OSH leveraging community resources as follows:  \n \na.  Consultation/Expedited Admission Service: Modify expedited admission processes to \nemphasize consultative availability upon request regardless of referral source, with \nprotocol development in consultation with the Neutral Expert to go into effect by June \n30, 2022.  \nb.  Court-lead โJail Reviewโ: Starting in July 2022, support OJDโs efforts to expand the \nMultnomah County โjail reviewโ initiative and prioritize AA assessments and reviews of \nindividuals in jail who have appeared to have positive changes in mental status that \nwould likely yield a finding of Able to Aid and Assist prior to admission to OSH and/or be \neligible for diversion from the pool of individuals waiting for admission. \nc.  Community Jail In-Reach and Diversion from OSH Admissions List: By August 2022 \nregardless of whether there is a court-led โjail reviewโ, OHA should engage stakeholders \nto develop a process for real-time ongoing local in-jail review/consultation of all \ncurrently detained defendants in the Aid and Assist process ordered for restoration, and \nleverage resources expended on jail diversion programs in the community to conduct \nthese reviews. These reviews should provide in-jail real time coordination for individuals \non the inpatient admission list and leverage opportunities for diversion from OSH \nadmission when feasible. OHA and OSH should work in partnership with the \ncommunities and with courts to maximize opportunities for alternative pathways for \nindividuals on the admissions list. For example, when it appears an individual has been \nrestored or is newly taking medication and eligible for community restoration while \nawaiting admission, these reviews should aim to facilitate diversion from OSH \nadmission. Contract changes may be needed to fulfill this recommendation. If resources \nare not available for such a process, OHA and OSH should seek support for such \nresources.  \n \n8.  Improvements in GEI community placement elements: Recommended improvements related to \nGEI processes include the following actions to be taken by OHA and OSH: \n \na.  OHA should explore all available means to provide additional resources for community \nproviders to prepare timely discharge plan development for GEI patients including \nevaluations by CMHPs.  This will include devising a funding mechanism to pay for \nevaluations by CMHPs as ordered by the PSRB.  This may include a base rate for \ncompleting evaluations within 30 days. \n \nb.  OHA should present a plan to ensure that community evaluations are scheduled within \n15 days of receipt of the order and completed within 45 days. This may include review \nof data on the timeliness of these evaluations, modification of contracts, rules, or other \nmeans to accomplish this recommendation. OHA should take all reasonable steps to \nimplement such a plan and secure funding needed to implement it. OHA, in consultation \nwith the PSRB, should present to the Neutral Expert a proposed timeline for \nimplementing this plan as expeditiously as possible. OHAโs plan for timely evaluations \nand expedited discharge processes should provide for a review of denials of referrals by \n24 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nprograms to ensure transparency with program waitlists and related resource issues and \naddress factors including but not limited to:  \ni.  Delays in interview/evaluation that are created because of a program not having \na vacancy;  \nii.  Delays that may be created when the program is โopen to referrals,โ but may \nnot have a vacancy; and \niii.  Delays created by virtue of programs โrejectingโ a referral, with potential \nremedies including a required review by OHA of any referrals being declined.  \n \n9.  Discharge process prioritization: Continue implementation of SB 295 Court case specific actions \nand initiate any needed associated rulemaking.  The parties agree that adherence to SB 295 (law \nproviding for discharge of .370 patients who no longer require HLOC) is critical for compliance \nand efforts to help with this seem to be working.  The state hospital must be able to make room \nfor new admissions to OSH and to have individuals who no longer need institutional care placed \nin a less restrictive setting. According to tracking by the State, some state courts and CMHPs are \nnot following this law as it is written, which results in .370 patients on the Ready to Place List \nstaying at OSH for longer than necessary or allowed by law.  To support adherence to SB 295, \nthe parties will do the following: \na. Informal support. General counsel for OSH will continue already ongoing efforts to \nsupport compliance through targeted communications with individual defense lawyers and \nprosecutors. MPD will now also make themselves available to try and intervene with \ndefense lawyers to ensure they follow SB 295.   \nb. Advocacy.  DOJ will continue evaluating cases on a state-wide basis for direct legal \nintervention on behalf of OSH where they determine that SB 295 is not being followed by \nstate courts or CMHPs.  DRO will develop, and revise as needed, an amicus brief that it will \nfile such cases where appropriate. DOJ will notify DRO about the OSH intervention and will \nprovide information needed for DRO to evaluate whether to intervene or submit an amicus \nbrief.  DOJ will track reasons courts are not ordering discharge. DRO will also enlist the \nadvocacy of MPD when appropriate. \nc. Rulemaking and Reduced Reliance on Single Solutions for Discharge.  OHA shall amend the \nOARs applicable to AA Ready-to-Place defendants to clarify that the treating clinical teamโs \nclinical recommendations primarily guide discharge planning.  Consistent with clinical best \npractice and existing legal standards regarding the ADAโs integration mandate, level of care \nshould be the least restrictive.  CMHPs should provide information about what is available in \nthe community including any reasonable options for a referral to a different community \nsupportive placement when clinically appropriate, if the identified recommended โlevelโ is \nnot available. This might include, for example, providing information about a lower level of \ncare that could be crafted with enhanced supports to meet the individualโs needs. \n10. Forensic evaluation quality and efficiencies: OHA/OSH should continue to support work to \ndevelop improved infrastructure and efficiencies for forensic evaluations. I recommended in my \nFirst Report the need to examine evaluation practices in greater depth. OJD has been taking the \nlead convening a broad stakeholder group to examine structures and funding for Oregon \n25 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nforensic evaluation services. With this in mind, OJD has agreed to lead in the writing of a report \nregarding the workgroupโs efforts, and OHA/OSH and the other Parties in the Mink/Bowman \nmatter should review and refine any drafts of that report before finalizing. This report would \nhelp inform any future recommendations or legislative proposals. I recommend that such a \nreport be produced by October 2022, and that the report include: \na.  Summary โmapโ of current evaluation processes across Oregon \nb.  Sources of funding and evaluators and associated costs across Oregon \nc.  Delineation of at least three (3) model options to highlight that include for each option: \ni.  Organizational structure \nii.  Funding recommendations \niii.  Prioritization of access to court-ordered evaluations for first evaluations to \nmaximize access to evaluators \niv.  Maximum efficiency for access to evaluators and production of their reports \n \n11. Contractual requirement reviews: In consultation with the Neutral Expert and the plaintiffs and \nin an ongoing manner, OHA should review existing contracts with the CCOs and CMHPโs to \ndetermine the scope of the existing contractual obligations to serve the Aid and Assist and GEI \npopulation. I understand these discussions are also happening in the legislative workgroups, but \na focus on this population in particular is imperative and urgent. For example, OHA should \nexplain to both CCOs and CMHPs that transport back to community from OSH through Non-\nEmergency Transport Provider (NEMT) is a Medicaid funded service, and OHA should work \nfurther with OJD to review this option given OJDs interest in this as a potentially helpful addition \nto increase timely transports from OSH. OHA should provide monthly updates on this in its \nregular progress reports to the Neutral Expert.  \n \n12. 1115 Medicaid waiver development: The OHA Medicaid team will continue working on the 1115 \nwaiver, which would continue limited Medicaid coverage and for individuals at OSH under .370 \norders 6 months prior to discharge. If the waiver is accepted, OHA will amend the CCO contract \nin 2023 to require Intensive Care Coordination for all clients currently at OSH under 370 orders \nin preparation for community placement. Should this occur, such ICC should be coordinated and \ntake into account the Community Navigators, and OHA should evaluate whether the new ICC \nservices or other available programs (such as ACT Teams) are sufficient to perform the desired \nfunctions of Community Navigators.  \n \n13. Substance use disorder treatments: Expand access to substance use treatment including \nmedications for addiction treatment (MAT) and contingency management (to address stimulant \nuse disorder) in residential and community programs that serve people under AA orders. \nSimilarly for the OSH population, efforts should be made to fostering greater focus on substance \nuse treatment services for individuals in AA and GEI processes. These services are critical as the \ndata shows there is a close nexus between recidivism or even referral for AA evaluations and \nrestoration and co-occurring substance use disorders.  These services should be incorporated \ninto the refinements of services offered for people in Community Restoration Programs (CRPs).  \n \n14. Community Restoration Program access: CRPs are seen by the Parties as a necessary component \nof the AA system and alternatives to OSH and need to be strengthened. To that end, OHA should \nconduct an inventory of the current status of CRPs and their statewide availability across all \n26 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \ncounties and present findings of this review to the Neutral Expert and DRO and MPD by August \n15, 2022. Plans to address any gaps in these services should be prioritized.  \n  \nAdditional items that were discussed as potential strategies for system improvement over time include \nstrengthening bed tracking capabilities with regard to the availability of residential beds (SRTF, RTF, RTH, \nwith ACT availability when feasible) and the closure of existing beds that are available to divert GEI or \naid and assist patients from OSH or to such patients discharging from OSH, as well as reviewing \nComagine Health activities.  The development of any expanded bed tracking in the future should \nconsider whether to link to the developing bed tracking system through Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity (OHSU) or whether a separate bed tracker would be more useful to help achieve and sustain \ncompliance. Also, future reviews of additional contracts such as Comagine Health may be needed to \nensure that barriers to access to care are minimized. Although these would be useful, in my opinion, \nthese items should be re-evaluated after the above priority items are underway.  \n \nII.  Recommendations Likely Requiring Legislative Actions, Rulemaking, or Federal Authorities \n \nIn addition to the recommendations noted above, several items are outlined below that would likely be \nhelpful in achieving more timely compliance, yet they are dependent on factors not as directly under the \npurview of OHA/OSH. These items will generally require legislative or significant rule change or might be \nconsidering by the Federal Court in an effort to help the state move toward compliance. Such \nrecommendations are as follows: \n \n1.  Finances Regarding State Hospital Utilization: In my First Neutral Expert report, I made \nrecommendations that were supported by the Parties regarding county financial risk sharing. \nCurrently fiscal responsibility for utilization of OSH beds lies entirely with the state and not the \ncounties. A greater shared focus with local entities on this resource could potentially improve its \nutilization management for communities, which would help increase access to more \npopulations. In my own clinical experience, I saw this very active engagement with discharge \nprocesses when payment for bed days was also being factored into need for care.  \n \nAfter my First Report, legislative language was proposed by OHA on the county risk sharing \nconcept but was not picked up in budget notes. Many CMHPs and others raised concerns that \nthe community system is still too fragile without having gained the dollars allocated by the \nlegislature, and that funding for AA defendants is more complicated and involves more than the \nCMHPs. Some CMHP directors thought a risk sharing proposal had some merit but might be \nbetter with incentives attached. Therefore, taking feedback from communities and in \nconsultation with OHA and DRO, I recommend shifting the January 2022 Neutral Expert Report \nrecommendations to include incentives to the proposed cost sharing a program with CMHP and \nfurther recommend that counties, and CCOs share in both the risk and incentives aimed at \nreducing length of stay for individuals in the AA and GEI processes on the ready to place list. The \nparties should work with appropriate legislators and others to help develop formulas for this \nactivity in advance of the 2023 legislative session.  \n \n2.  Duration of Competence Restoration: It is a Constitutional right to be competent to stand trial if \none is to be tried criminally. With that in mind, efforts at restoration are critical. Nevertheless, \n27 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nnotions for the appropriate and permissible duration of competence restoration vary widely \nacross states For Oregon, I recommend the parties work jointly with willing stakeholders to \npropose new legislation that decreases the maximum restoration time limits, Current legislation \n(ORS 161.370) for inpatient restoration holds that: \n \n(10) โฆin no event shall the defendant be committed for longer than whichever of \nthe following, measured from the defendantโs initial custody date, is shorter:  \n(A) Three years; or \n(B) A period of time equal to the maximum sentence the court could have \nimposed if the defendant had been convicted.  \n \nThere are no current time limits for community restoration. In my opinion, Oregonโs processes \ncould be improved and access to services gained if the law aligns more with clinical data, case \nlaw, and legislation in other states that focus restoration on its intended purpose. To that end, I \nrecommend legislative change regarding restoration time limits and practices as follows:  \n \na.  Time for both inpatient and community restoration services should be: \ni.  For misdemeanors, the lesser of the maximum permissible sentence (or a \nportion thereof) for the underlying offense or 90 days \nii.  For felonies, the lesser of the maximum permissible sentence (or a portion \nthereof) for the underlying offence or six (6) months, unless the felony involves \nserious violence in which case an option for an additional six-month period of \nrestoration could be sought for a total not to exceed one (1) year.   \n1.  For serious violent felonies, after the initial six-month period of \nrestoration and a finding that the defendant remains unable to Aid and \nAssist but restorable, a further period of restoration should require an \naffirmative request by a party to the litigation. The optional additional \nsix (6) months for restoration of defendants charged with a serious \nviolent felony should then require the Court to enter a finding that the \nGovernmentโs interest in prosecuting the case is strong, and that factors \nin progress toward restorability to date and likelihood of further \nrestorability, as well as the pre-trial defendantโs interest under \nOlmstead v. L.C. (1999). to be in a the least restrictive setting to meet \ntheir clinical needs, as distinct from those that would allow a defendant \nto be held in custody. The finding by the Court authorizing an additional \nperiod would then allow for up to six months for a total restoration \nperiod not to exceed one (1) year. \nb.  In my opinion, the Court in making its findings should rely upon clinical opinions, and the \nforensic evaluators in rendering their opinions of restorability should provide compelling \nclinical data to support a substantial likelihood beyond probability that the defendant \nshall regain their capacity to aid and assist at the end of the restoration period, based on \nevidence that with treatment, the defendant is likely to evidence signs such as, \nsymptom attenuation related to thought, mood, orientation or memory, capacity to \nrecognize reality, reasoning, judgment and/or behavior, or improvements in functional \nand adaptive deficits related to being able to Aid and Assist. Evaluators should take into \n28 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \naccount the nature of the condition rendering the defendant unable to Aid and Assist \nwith regard to restorability. For example, restorability opinions and adjudications should \nrequire specific data to support substantial likelihood beyond probability especially for \ndefendants whose ability to aid and assist is less likely to be restored timely through \ninpatient or community-based restoration services such as those defendants who have \nrepeatedly been previously found unrestorable or who have neurocognitive disorders \n(such as dementia and traumatic brain injury) or significant neurodevelopmental \ndisorders contributing to their inability to aid and assist. Clinical evidence of symptom \nattenuation or improvements in competency functional deficits should be noted for \ndefendants charged with a serious felony for whom an extension of the restoration \nperiod is granted. \n \nc.  Restoration across multiple charges should be consolidated and contiguous consecutive \nperiods of restoration should be eliminated unless there are new charges incurred after \nan initial period of restoration has ended.  \n \nd.  Aid and Assist progress/periodic Aid and Assist reports should be brief, relying on more \ncomplete evaluations that were made for the initial findings of a defendant being \nUnable to Aid and Assist. The brief periodic update reports should be done at intervals, \nwith the first three at no longer than 30, 60 and 90 days, followed by every 90 days. Aid \nand Assist progress updates should also be filed as soon as feasible after there is clinical \ndata supporting that the defendant has regained abilities to Aid and Assist, and no later \nthan the external time limits. Again, these updated reports should be brief and delineate \nwhether there have been any changes in mental status or clinical functioning related to \nAid and Assist capacities (rather than complete de novo evaluations), sufficient for the \nCourt to make a finding as needed.  \n \ne.  Although beyond these legislative recommendations, there should be further \nexploration of opportunities for defendants found Unable to Aid and Assist or โMed \nNeverโ to ensure access to appropriate services as needed. \n \nThe above recommendations are based on several supporting considerations, many of which are \nas follows: \n \nBackground: Case law (Jackson v. Indiana, 1972) specifies that the duration of restoration should \nbe for the period of time in which there is a reasonable probability that an individual will be \nrestored, and that commitment to an institution for restoration be for the purpose for which it \nwas intended. Thus, once a defendant is thought to no longer be able to be restored, any \nadditional confinement must be on other grounds.   \n \nClinical Studies: Studies of inpatient restoration report restoration to be most likely between 90 \ndays and six months, though methodological issues in these studies are complicated, making the \nfindings limited. This data is likely skewed by days spent in legal processes and other factors that \nadd time to the reported duration of restoration, given what we know about response to \n29 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nmedication occurring more rapidly in most cases of serious mental illness. Furthermore, \nreported times for โsuccessfulโ restoration condense across defendants, regardless of diagnoses \nand charges and allowable duration.   Also, in a recent comprehensive review1 of outpatient \ncompetency restoration programs (OCRP), states reported an average of 149 days for \nrestoration for individuals restored, and with outliers removed, that average was 111 days even \nthough some programs had individuals in residential services and others did not.  \n \nOSH data and Community Restoration factors: Data from 10 years of OSH admissions shows \nextended use of bed days-for some small population of individuals beyond one year of \nrestoration services (See Figure 4 above). This requires additional time and OSH resources to \nmaintain restoration activities for prolonged periods for a few people in this process, and thus \nremoves the potential for more timely access to beds for those that might be more likely to \nbenefit from those restoration activities. Furthermore, having no end date to community \nrestoration puts defendants at risk for perpetual court oversight, raising serious concerns that \ndefendants with disabilities may be treated differently as pre-trial defendants with little \nmeaningful purpose, and raises concerns about resource allocation. \n \nPolicy and Other State Legislation: According to Zapfโs Washington Public Policy Institute review \nfrom 2013, almost a decade ago, the National Judicial College established proposed standards \nfor timeframes for competency restoration, which were roughly 120 days for misdemeanants \nand up to one year for felony defendants.2  A review of state statutes as noted above (see Figure \n5) for inpatient restoration shows that of those states with timelines for inpatient restoration, \nOregonโs time frames are the 8th longest out of 25 states. Also, for states that distinguish \ntimeframes for restoration between misdemeanor charges and felony charges, there are \nsignificant differences of those allotted times. \n \nAlthough outpatient programs are still new, in my opinion, it is reasonable to consider \ntimeframes for restoration that are the same as those for people in hospitals especially as some \ntime in a hospital is often related to working with individuals who have not been adherent to \nmedication, and in Oregon persons with serious mental illness in CRPs are required to be \nadherent to treatment. There are challenges at times with follow-up and accessing community \nappointments, but by developing a clearer CRP manualized approach, some of those issues can \nbe addressed in practice. Also, those with more significant I/DD needs or those with chronic \nmental illness and lower-level offenses may not be as likely to be restored regardless. Thus, \ntimelines should not exceed those necessary to determine restorability (or remediation). As an \nexample, Washington D.C. provides for a maximum restoration period not to exceed 180 days \nfor all defendants (s.24-531.05(e)) in its Outpatient Competency Restoration Program.   \n \nClinical experience: In speaking to countless individuals in competency processes in multiple \nstates as a treating psychiatrist, evaluator and/or consultant, time spent in legal education for \n \n1 Gowensmith, W. N., Frost, L. E., Speelman, D. W., & Therson, D. E. (2016). Lookinโ for beds in all the wrong places: Outpatient \ncompetency restoration as a promising approach to modern challenges. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 22(3), 293โ305.   \n2 Zapf, P. (2013). Standardizing Protocols for Treatment to Restore Competency to Stand Trial: Interventions and Clinically \nAppropriate Time Periods (Document No. 13-01-1901). Olympia: Washington State Institute for Public Policy. \n30 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nindividuals with serious mental illness and IDD, while getting needed treatment and supports \ncan be of assistance and is considered an important part of restoration. However, an over-focus \non legal education can have intangible collateral consequences of lowering self-esteem when \ntask demand exceeds capacity and a belief that competency is a โpass/failโ assessment that \ncreates anxiety (while factual understanding is only one aspect of competence to stand trial), \nand a sense of spending time in repetitive programming. These elements can also then \ntranslates into time not spent engaging in other activities that might have a more beneficial \nimpact on illness management, overall recovery, and reduced recidivism. Current workforce \ndemands make it even more imperative that work be directed in the most productive ways \npossible, while not leading to compromised public safety. These factors support my \nrecommendation for shortening maximum durations for restoration, while recognizing the \nConstitutional right to be tried as a competent criminal defendant. \n \n3.  Community Restoration Program Refinements: As noted above, Community Restoration \nPrograms (CRP) provide a critical opportunity for services outside of OSH when appropriate and \nmaximizing their potential could yield greater compliance with Mink (as well as Olmstead \nrequirements).  Above I made a recommendation to review and ensure current program access \nstatewide. Other actions will likely require legislative requests, either through a Policy Option \nPackage or other means to secure the necessary staff and funds to accomplish the following \nfurther recommendations. Therefore, OHA should work with stakeholders including DRO and in \nconsultation with the Neutral Expert in advance of the 2023 legislative session to foster \nenhancements, including:  \n \na.  By October 1, 2023, OHA should, in consultation with Plaintiffs and other stakeholders, \nand with input from the Neutral Expert, develop a CRP manual, delineate best practices \nacross regions, engage in training, develop standard court forms. Oregonโs rules (309-\n088-0115) already identify elements of restoration services, but some may be \nambiguous or appear crossover with other funded behavioral health services. As such, \nsuggested areas of focus for protocol development including the following examples of \nwhat might be included:  \ni.  referral processes  \nii.  qualifying criteria (and any inclusion/exclusion criteria) \niii.  acceptance/admissions procedures \niv.  scope of services minimally required including those focused on co-occurring \nsubstance use disorders \nv.  measurement of outcomes and data collection (consider including items such as \nlength of stay, total number restored and total number served, total number \nfound unable, hospitalizations, technical pre-trial violations, new arrests) \nvi.  any special provisions for clients with I/DD needs \nvii.  clarification for communities to best identify which services should be covered \nunder which payment mechanism (e.g., Medicaid or CRP funding) \n \nb.  By October 2023, OHA should enhance CRP data reporting from quarterly to more active \nregular contemporaneous reporting (and fund the needed infrastructure to do so) so \nthat reports can be generated as needed by OHA to include potential items such as:  \ni.  Number of people being served in CRP \n31 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nii.  Number of people ultimately opined Able and those opined Unable to Aid and \nAssist related to felony or misdemeanor charges \niii.  Categorization of clinical issues: SUD, SMI, IDD, or a combination of these \niv.  Types of services received \nv.  Categorization of residential level of care and/or housing status  \nvi.  Categorizations that examine population demographics to inform policies to \nenhance equitable access to community-based restoration for diverse \npopulations \n \nc.  Beginning in the next fiscal year, OHA should produce an annual report on CRP activities \nfor public access to inform further legislative needs for communities to best deliver CRP \nservices, inform proposals for legislative change, resource needs, and inter-relationships \nof stakeholders involved with CRP participants and the courts.  \n \nd.  OHA should foster best practices in CRP through collaborative training opportunities \nacross counties and in consultation with OJD, municipal courts, defense, and \nprosecution, by offering trainings/community of practice opportunities beginning by \nOctober 2023.  \n \n4.  Alternative Pathways for Misdemeanant Defendants: With regard to defendants charged with \nmisdemeanors in the AA process, OHA/OJD/DRO/MPD should make every effort to work \ncollaboratively with stakeholders to identify alternatives that no longer utilize OSH when there is \nno real Government interest in pursuing prosecution and work to pursue avenues for alternative \ncommunity plans for these individuals. Alternative pathways should and could include, when \npossible, diverting them from evaluation all together, releasing them from jail on pretrial \nconditions, and diverting them from OSH or discharging them when community restoration is an \noption. The increased demand of competency services for persons charged with misdemeanant \noffenses is a national trend. Many of these individuals need hospital level of care, but their \ncriminal issues are more minor, raising questions about the use of โrestorationโ as a means of \naccessing services when prosecution is not ultimately going to be pursued. Once referred for \ncompetence to stand trial evaluation and restoration, these defendants are at greater risk for \njail stays as opposed to opportunities for diversion and treatment. Recommendation I.B.4 in the \nsection above speaks to developing training related to these issues. Beyond training, I \nrecommend that the state also analyze data trends for individuals charged with misdemeanors \nsent to the state hospital to allow for further recommendations in this matter including \nlegislative fixes that may provide pathways to alternative access to treatments for these \npopulations. At the same time, this may be an issue of consideration also for the Federal Court, \ngiven the potential Constitutional and Olmstead issues at stake for all defendants but \nmisdemeanant defendants in particular. \n \n5.  OSH Patient Care Improvement and Community Engagement: Separate and distinct from staffing \nrecommended in the January report, and recognizing that many of the recommendations \nthroughout this report will require additional staffing, I support a proposal from OHA that they \nwould explore all available means to obtain funding for seek one OSH data analyst and two OSH \ndata integration specialist positions to support Mink/Bowman treatment discharge approaches, \n32 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \ncommunity connections, and data reporting. The OSH Treatment Quality and Patient Care \nImprovement Unit will improve the provision of patient-specific resources to support an \nindividualโs recovery through community engagement, recommendations for continuity of care \npost-hospitalization, and recommendations for community resources post-hospitalization.  The \nOSH Treatment Quality and Patient Care Improvement unit will improve the provision of \ntrauma-informed, patient-centered care through identification of an individualโs community, \ncultural and linguistic needs to increase likelihood of treatment engagement/adherence post-\nhospitalization and potentially address diversity and equity issues. The OSH Treatment Quality \nand Patient Care Improvement Unit will improve the provision of direct-care services through \nstaff training, coaching and engagement on the units where the treatment services are \nprovided. This is an effort to sustain compliance by decreasing length of stay and recidivism \nrates and improving treatment engagement/adherence post-hospitalization. \n \n6.  CCO Enrollment: OHA should require counties to ensure ongoing CCO enrollment for all eligible \nindividuals who have been under an Aid and Assist order within the past two years. \n \nII.  Tracking Progress and Benchmarks toward Compliance Goals \n \nA.  Benchmarks \n \nDiscussions with the parties resulted in the crafting of benchmarks to help drive toward measurable \nprogress toward compliance. The parties agreed that benchmark time frames would not include \nโoutliersโ or the rare delays that are not attributable to bed or community restoration capacity. It is my \nrecommendation that the following incremental benchmark goals be used to assess progress toward \ncompliance in this Mink case:   \n \nโข  By August 1, 2022 โ Average wait time to admission 22 days or fewer \nโข  By October 1, 2022 โ Average wait time to admission 17 days or fewer \nโข  By January 1, 2023 โ Average wait time to admission 11 days or fewer \nโข  By February 14, 2023 โ Average wait time to admission 7 days or fewer  \n \nWith the above in mind, in recommending these benchmarks, I have taken into account an examination \nof existing data and consideration of efforts identified in my January report, current plans for funding \nthe community system through the RFA process, progress as reported by the State, and implementation \nof recommendations prioritized above.  \n \nFor many years, the State complied with the 7-day standard articulated in the Courtโs permanent \ninjunction and the constitutional rights of pretrial detainees.  With the right planning, staffing, and \ncommunity resource, Oregon can once again achieve complaint with the Courtโs order.  That said, it will \nbe important to review each benchmark at each time point to understand the nuances in the system \ndynamics at those times as they relate to compliance. Moreover, in setting these benchmarks, I \nrecommend that the Parties continue to meet regularly to discuss progress toward compliance and \ndetermine barriers and solutions to the next benchmark.  Therefore, if at the time of the Partiesโ \nmeeting to discuss them, the benchmarks set out in this plan are not met, the Parties and the Neutral \nExpert will discuss additional actions that can be taken to meet the next benchmarks. Based on these \n33 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \ndiscussions, there may be recommendations to the Court regarding additional actions beyond those \nalready recommended/agreed upon that can be taken to regain compliance. Of course, at any point, the \nParties may also seek mediation through Federal Court processes as they see appropriate. \n \nB.    Tracking legislatively appropriated funding \nOne theme that has arisen in my conversations with stakeholders has been whether the state has issued \nthe dollars allocated in a timely and expedient manner to get to the communities to achieve compliance \nas soon as possible. Community leaders with whom I spoke have expressed several concerns about \nneeding additional dollars, and others have wondered about why appropriated dollars have not been \nspent and expressed views bout perceived delays on many levels. At the same time the State has \nindicated that dollars that had been more widely distributed had not yielded the specific results and \naccountability toward compliance in this litigation that had been hoped, necessitating, from the Stateโs \nperspective, alternative policy strategies for distributing dollars, and necessitating more internal staff \nresources to manage the newly appropriate dollars wisely.  \nBecause of the questions raised, I asked the state to develop a high level financial analytic report that \ncould address some of the questions. That analysis was conducted, and an early draft was shared with \nme. The State has since developed a website to provide information about behavioral health spending \nand improve transparency for it (See: https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HSD/AMH/Pages/index.aspx). This \nshould continue to be updated. OHA should continue in regular meetings with DRO and MPD and the \nNeutral Expert to discuss implementation of legislatively appropriated funds that have the potential to \nhelp OHA achieve compliance, to address remaining questions about prior spending decisions and to \nfoster planning for ongoing support of the above recommendations to achieve compliance. \nConcluding Comments:    \nThe parties are all in agreement that compliance with the seven-day standard is the ultimate goal set \nforth by the Court. Thus, in my discussions with them, there was agreement that the recommendations \nshould be pursued with some urgency and with the timelines set forth above, and that where required, \nthe State should utilize any available most efficient means for securing needed additional funding or \nstaff resources. During June through September 2022, OHA has agreed to compile the above \nrecommended legislative actions into a legislative concept and complete budget impact analyses. OHA \nwill present the recommended legislation during upcoming 2023 legislative session.  In June 2023, if \nthese recommendations are accepted, OHA has agreed to make any needed rule amendments and \ncontractual changes to support the recommendations embedded in this report.  \n \nEven with the recommendations above, it is unclear which direction the legislature will go with them. As \nnoted, the legislative presiding officers have convened a workgroup to examine funding of services for \nindividuals in AA, PSRB and Civil Commitment processes. I recommend that the parties participate as \nrequested in that work and help inform that workgroup of the activities and recommendations in this \nreport. I also recommend that the State be prepared to respond to any inquiries related to funding \nexpenditures, fiscal accountability, and requests for data to help the legislature take actions to assist the \nState in achieving Mink/Bowman compliance, including the enactment of the recommendations in this \nreport that require the legislature's support. By doing so, it is hoped that the means to achieve these \nrecommendations will be realized, and that proposed legislation will be met with broad-based \n34 \n \n\nOregon Neutral Expert Second Report Regarding Mink/Bowman \n6/5/22 \n          \n \nacceptance, recognizing the urgency of making system shifts for those individuals waiting in jail for \naccess to needed behavioral health services. It is further hoped and recommended therefore that the \nparties will continue to work jointly to pursue support for the recommendations above through their \nown stakeholder engagement processes. \nFinally, the Parties should continue to meet regularly with the Neutral Expert at a cadence to be \ndetermined as recommended by the Neutral Expert and in consultation with the Parties, but no less \nthan monthly to track progress and discuss plans for the implementation of the recommendations \noutlined in both the First and this Second Report of the Neutral Expert Report in this matter. \nI would like to acknowledge the stakeholders with whom I spoke and their uniform commitment to \nimproving access to care and to serving a population with complex behavioral health needs while \nsupporting public safety. I would like to especially commend the Parties for their incredibly thoughtful \nand mutual labor-intensive and good faith work within their roles to help inform the development of \nthese recommendations and to support the work on behalf of the individuals affected by the \nMink/Bowman-related challenges. I greatly appreciate the help of the leadership and staff at OHA, OSH, \nDRO, MPD, OJD, and the PSRB in my work. I also acknowledge with gratitude Mr. Cody Gabel who again \nassisted me in coordinating meetings and tracking information I requested, and to Mr. Scott Hillier for \nhis data support used to inform these recommendations.  \n \nRespectfully Submitted by: \n \nDebra A.
