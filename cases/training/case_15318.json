    "summary": "<p>On September 9, 2014, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), along with several of its members who had been discriminated against by Uber drivers because of their service animals, filed this lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued Uber under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12811 et seq.), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 51 & 52), and the California Disabled Persons Act (California Civil Code §§ 54-54.3). Represented by Disability Rights Advocates and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for the named plaintiffs.</p><p>The plaintiffs accused Uber drivers of, among other things, refusing to provide service to people with service dogs, mistreating the dogs and their owners, unfairly giving them negative feedback scores, and charging inappropriate cancellation fees. They alleged that Uber’s response to complaints about driver behavior was opaque and insufficient: Uber generally failed to notify service dog owners of whether the company had investigated complaints, and denied responsibility for drivers’ behavior.</p><p>On October 22, 2014, Uber filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the NFB and the named plaintiffs all lacked standing to sue under both state and federal law. Uber also argued that even if the plaintiffs had standing, Uber wasn’t a public accommodation and thus wasn’t covered by Title III of the ADA. </p><p>The United States Department of Justice issued a statement of interest on December 23, 2014. It asked the court to consider the Department of Transportation’s Title III regulations, which are granted considerable weight since the DOT is responsible for implementing the ADA. DOT regulations state that Title III applies to any “demand-responsive” service that doesn’t operate on a fixed route, and that private entities cannot “contract away” any responsibilities under the ADA. 49 C.F.R. § 37.3; 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.23. The DOT regulations further require entities covered by Title III to permit service animals to accompany their owners into vehicles, and requires entities to apply eligibility criteria that don’t screen disabled people out, unless doing so would make it impossible to provide the service. 49 C.F.R. § 37.167(d); 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(1); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(f). The regulations also require positive action on the part of private entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination (except when those modifications would fundamentally alter the service), and to ensure that their personnel are trained to properly assist disabled individuals in a respectful and courteous way, with appropriate attention to the difference among individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A); 49 C.F.R. § 37.173. </p><p>On April 17, 2015, the court denied Uber’s motion to dismiss. It found that even if not all Uber drivers discriminated against blind people with service animals, discrimination by some drivers was sufficient injury for the plaintiffs to bring suit. The court also found that the NFB could sue even if some of its members had signed binding arbitration agreements with Uber, because many of its members had not. The court didn’t directly respond to the DOJ’s statement of interest, finding instead that since there was a possibility that Uber was covered by the ADA and the California statutes, the parties should have the opportunity to litigate the question. 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073.</p><p>On December 6, 2016, the court approved a settlement agreement. Uber agreed to: <ul><li>Require its drivers to provide service to blind people with service animals<li>Modify its cleaning fee policy for messes caused by service animals<li>Make it easier for service animal owners to file complaints<li>Implement enhanced procedures for investigating complaints<li>Dismiss drivers receiving multiple plausible complaints<li>Submit to third-party monitoring<li>Pay the NFB $75,000 per year for three years<li>Pay a lump sum of $45,000 for distribution among the named plaintiffs<li>Pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs</ul>Uber also agreed to a class certification for purposes of the settlement, extending to all blind people with service animals who had used, attempted to use, or been deterred from attempting to use transportation through the Uber app.</p><p>The settlement was to last for a default period of 3½ years. Retired Judge Margaret A. Nagle was appointed as a neutral monitor to oversee compliance. The monitor had authority to extend the agreement by 1½ years if Uber failed to substantially comply with the terms of the agreement in the second or third year. Any disputes related to the monitor would first be referred to an arbitrator, and if that failed, the court would exercise jurisdiction.</p><p>Two weeks following the approval of the settlement agreement, on December 15, 2016, the court awarded the plaintiffs $2,485,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs. Uber appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal with prejudice on March 7, 2017. </p><p>On November 8, 2019, the court ordered Uber to pay the plaintiffs a total of $313,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in monitoring and enforcing the agreement. </p><p>On July 15, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to modify the settlement. As of July 20, 2020, the court’s jurisdiction over the settlement agreement is ongoing.</p>",

Compl. ¶¶ 1, 87, \n9  102, 103 (ECF No. 17).  Plaintiffs allege that Uber provides several different demand responsive \n10  transportation services, all of which are initiated by communicating with Uber through a mobile \n11  software  application  for  smart  phones.    Compl.  ¶¶  29,  88.    The  Complaint  focuses  on \n12  Defendants’  “UberX”  transportation  system—one  of  Uber’s  most  cost-effective  demand \n13  responsive services.  Compl. ¶¶ 2, 29, 88.  Plaintiffs allege that “UberX drivers are refusing to \n14  transport many blind individuals who use service animals.”  Compl. ¶ 3.  Some UberX drivers \n15  also allegedly “seriously mishandle guide dogs” and “harass blind customers with guide dogs.”  \n16  Compl. ¶ 4.  In response to complaints lodged with Uber about these allegations, Uber allegedly \n17  fails  to  respond,  does  not  take  steps  to  address  the  discrimination,  and  frequently  denies \n18  responsibility for the discrimination.  Compl. ¶ 5.  Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, blind persons \n19  “have been and continue to be denied access to Defendants’ services on multiple occasions when \n20  they attempt to use Uber’s UberX transportation service.”  Compl. ¶ 103.   \n21  Plaintiffs’ Complaint pleads four causes of action, including one expressly based on the \n22  ADA.1  The ADA claim alleges that Defendants violated Title III of the ADA generally, as well \n23 \n                                                           \n24  1 Notably, two of the other causes of action are based on California laws that incorporate the \nADA by reference, and the fourth cause of action is a request for declaratory relief based, in part, \n25 \non Title III of the ADA.  Compl. ¶¶ 108-09, 114, 121-22.  Thus, it appears all of Plaintiffs’ \n26  causes of action are directly or indirectly based on the ADA.  But, for purposes of this Statement \nof Interest, we only discuss the first cause of action, which alleges direct violations of the ADA. \n27  - 1 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page3 of 9\n1  as  two  specific  provisions  of  Title  III:  42  U.S.C.  § 12182,  which  prohibits  disability \n2  discrimination by public accommodations, and 42 U.S.C. § 12184, which prohibits disability \n3  discrimination  by  certain  transportation  service  providers.    Compl.  ¶¶  77-104.    Defendants \n4  moved to dismiss on various grounds, including under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \n5  for failure to state a claim.  In their brief, Defendants explain that they move to dismiss each \n6  cause of action, including the ADA claim, “to the extent it is based on the allegation that Uber’s \n7  app or website constitute a place of public accommodation or that Defendants own, lease or \n8  operate a place of public accommodation under the ADA.”  Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 22 (ECF \n9  No. 25).   \n10  Defendants’ motion is ambiguous, however, as to whether they move to dismiss the ADA \n11  claim (and Complaint) in full or in part.  Defendants appear to imply that, if the Court determines \n12  that they are not a public accommodation, then the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ ADA claim \n13  (and the Complaint) in full.  Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 22-25.  Any such implication would \n14  reflect a misunderstanding about the scope of Title III’s coverage.  The success of Plaintiffs’ \n15  ADA claim is not dependent on a finding that Defendants are a public accommodation, because \n16  § 12184 of Title III of the ADA applies to private entities that are primarily engaged in providing \n17  transportation services regardless of whether the private entity is a public accommodation.  See \n18  42 U.S.C. § 12184.  Furthermore, because coverage under this provision of Title III is not \n19  dependent upon coverage under any other provision, even if Defendants were not covered as a \n20  public accommodation under § 12182, they still could be covered as a transportation service \n21  provider under § 12184.  The United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest to \n22  clarify the proper interpretation and application of the ADA with respect to this issue.2 \n23 \n24 \n                                                           \n2 The United States takes no position on any other issues currently before the Court.  We seek \n25 \nonly to clarify any possible confusion regarding the scope of Title III’s coverage as a result of \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss.  Accordingly, we do not address herein the issue of whether, \n26 \nunder the facts alleged in the Complaint, Uber is a public accommodation. \n27  - 2 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page4 of 9\n1  I.  INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n2  Under 28 U.S.C. § 517, the Attorney General may send any officer of the United States \n3  Department of Justice “to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court \n4  of the United States….”  The United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is the federal agency \n5  charged with primary responsibility for enforcing Title III of the ADA and its implementing \n6  regulations.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12188(b) (2008); 28 C.F.R. §§ 36.502-36.504 (2010); 49 C.F.R. \n7  § 37.11 (1996); 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.11 (2014).  Consistent with this statutory charge, \n8  DOJ has an interest in supporting the ADA’s proper interpretation and application; furthering the \n9  statute’s  explicit  congressional  intent  to  provide  clear,  strong,  consistent,  and  enforceable \n10  standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities; and ensuring that the \n11  United States plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in the ADA.  See 42 \n12  U.S.C. § 12101(b).   \n13  The  United  States’  interests  are  particularly  strong  here,  where  Plaintiffs  allege \n14  discriminatory denial of full and equal access to transportation—an issue that goes to the very \n15  heart of the ADA’s goals “to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent \n16  living, and economic self-sufficiency” for individuals with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).  \n17  The right to travel with one’s service animal is critical to achieving these goals.  See 49 C.F.R. \n18  § 37.167; see also Tamara v. El Camino Hosp., 964 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1087 (N.D. Cal. 2013) \n19  (finding that separating an individual from his or her service animal can cause irreparable harm \n20  and  deprive  that  individual  of  independence).    Accordingly,  the  United  States  respectfully \n21  requests that the Court, in resolving Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, consider the interpretation \n22  of Title III and the applicable regulation as set forth in this Statement of Interest.3 \n23  II.  DISCUSSION \n24    While Title III is routinely characterized as the public accommodation title of the ADA, \n25 \n                                                           \n3 The United States does not intend to attend the February 5 hearing unless the Court requests its \n26 \npresence. \n27  - 3 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page5 of 9\n1  its reach is much broader.  Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability \n2  by a range of entities, including public accommodations and, as applicable here, private entities \n3  primarily engaged in providing transportation services.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, 12184.  This \n4  latter category is covered by § 12184 of Title III, which is not contingent on an entity’s status as \n5  a public accommodation.   \n6  A.  SECTION  12184  COVERS  TAXI  AND  OTHER  DEMAND  RESPONSIVE \nTRANSPORTATION SERVICES  \n7 \nThe statute and applicable regulation define coverage under 42 U.S.C. § 12184 to include \n8 \nmost  types  of  transportation  provided  by  private  companies.    Section  12184  prohibits \n9 \ndiscrimination “on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of specified public \n10 \ntransportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business of \n11 \ntransporting people and whose operations affect commerce.”  42 U.S.C. § 12184(a).  The term \n12 \n“specified public transportation” is broadly defined as transportation by any “conveyance” (other \n13 \nthan aircraft) “that provides the general public with general or special service (including charter \n14 \nservice) on a regular and continuing basis.”  42 U.S.C. § 12181(10).   \n15 \nCongress directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations to implement the \n16 \nTitle III transportation provisions, including § 12184.  42 U.S.C. § 12186(a).  Pursuant to this \n17 \nmandate, the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) promulgated 49 C.F.R. Part \n18 \n37  and  accompanying  guidance  that  explains  DOT’s  construction  and  interpretation  of  its \n19 \nimplementing regulation.  49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D.  Cf. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 \n20 \n(1997) (concluding that an agency’s interpretation of its regulations is “controlling unless plainly \n21 \nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Chevron, \n22 \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984) (“Considerable weight \n23 \nshould  be  accorded  to  an  executive  department’s  construction  of  a  statutory  scheme  it  is \n24 \nentrusted to administer.”). \n25 \nThe DOT regulation broadly defines the types of transportation services subject to Title \n26 \n27  - 4 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page6 of 9\n1  III.  The regulation and guidance clarify that such services include any transportation services \n2  provided by private entities that involve calling for a vehicle and a driver to take one places, \n3  including taxi services.  See 49 C.F.R. § 37.29; 49 pt. 37, app. D § 37.29 (“For purposes of this \n4  section, other transportation services that involve calling for a car and a driver to take one places \n5  … are regarded as taxi services.”).  The DOT regulation includes a specific provision for private \n6  entities providing taxi service and explains why they are covered by § 12184 of Title III:  \n7  Because they are “private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which \n8  provide demand responsive service.”  49 C.F.R. § 37.29.  The definition of “demand responsive” \n9  service or system is far from limited to just taxi service, however; it is in fact quite expansive, \n10  referring to “any system of providing transportation of individuals by a vehicle, other than … a \n11  fixed route system.”4  42 U.S.C. § 12181(3); 49 C.F.R. § 37.3.   \n12  In addition, the regulation defines what it means to “operate” a “demand responsive” \n13  system (or non-fixed route transportation system); in this context, “operates” includes “the \n14  provision of transportation services by a … private entity itself or by a person under a contractual \n15  or other arrangement or relationship with the entity.”  49 C.F.R. § 37.3.  Thus, an entity may \n16  operate a demand responsive system even if it does not itself provide transportation services, if it \n17  does so through a contractual relationship with another entity or even individual drivers.  Indeed, \n18  as explained in the DOT guidance, while an entity may contract out its service, it may not \n19  contract away its ADA responsibilities.  See 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.23; see also 49 C.F.R. \n20  § 37.23(d). \n21 \nB.  DISCRIMINATION UNDER § 12184 INCLUDES DENYING OR PROVIDING \nUNEQUAL SERVICE TO INDIVIDUALS WITH SERVICE ANIMALS \n22 \nUnder  §  12184,  discrimination  is  defined  broadly  to  include  refusing  to  provide \n23 \ntransportation service, or providing unequal service, to individuals with disabilities who can \n24 \nphysically access the vehicle.  49 C.F.R. §§ 37.5, 37.29(c).  The DOT regulation expressly states \n25 \n                                                           \n26  4 A fixed route system operates along a prescribed route according to a fixed schedule, like a \ntrain or a fixed-route bus.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(4); 49 C.F.R. § 37.3. \n27  - 5 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page7 of 9\n1  that such entities “shall permit service animals to accompany individuals with disabilities in \n2  vehicles.”  49 C.F.R. § 37.167(d).  Discrimination also includes the imposition or application of \n3  eligibility criteria that screen out an individual with a disability, or any class of individuals with \n4  disabilities, from fully enjoying the transportation services provided by the entity, unless such \n5  criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the services being offered.  42 U.S.C. \n6  § 12184(b)(1); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(f).   \n7  Private  entities  that  provide  transportation  services  also  have  affirmative  obligations \n8  under the ADA.  Such entities must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \n9  procedures  when  necessary  to  avoid  discrimination,  unless  the  entity  can  demonstrate  that \n10  making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the transportation services.  \n11  42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A).  And every private entity that operates a taxi service or other \n12  demand responsive system must “ensure that personnel are trained to proficiency, as appropriate \n13  to their duties, so that they … properly assist and treat individuals with disabilities who use the \n14  service in a respectful and courteous way, with appropriate attention to the difference among \n15  individuals with disabilities.”  49 C.F.R. § 37.173.  \n16  C.  PLAINTIFFS  NEED  NOT  SHOW  THAT  UBER  IS  A  PUBLIC \nACCOMMODATION TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIM UNDER § 12184 \n17 \nPrivate entities primarily engaged in providing transportation services are covered by \n18 \n§ 12184 of Title III, irrespective of whether they are also public accommodations.  Section \n19 \n12182, in contrast, sets out statutory requirements applicable only to “public accommodations.”  \n20 \nSection  12182  includes  general  and  specific  prohibitions  of  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \n21 \ndisability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \n22 \nor accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or \n23 \nleases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.5  42 U.S.C. § 12182.  Sections 12182 \n24 \n                                                           \n25  5 Section 12182 also includes specific prohibitions addressing discrimination in the provision of \ncertain types of transportation services operated by private entities that are not primarily engaged \n26 \nin the business of transporting people.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(b).   \n27  - 6 - \n          \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page8 of 9\n \n1  and 12184 of Title III are premised on and impose separate and distinct requirements, and \n2 \n2  coverage under one permits but does not necessitate coverage under the other.6   \n3 \n3  Within this statutory and regulatory framework, Plaintiffs can prevail on their ADA claim \n4 \n4  by demonstrating that (1) Plaintiffs have standing to sue under the ADA; (2) Defendants provide \n5 \n5  specified public transportation services and are primarily engaged in the business of transporting \n6 \n6  people,  42  U.S.C.  §  12184;  and  (3) Defendants,  directly  or  through  a  contractual  or  other \n7 \n7  relationship, discriminated on the basis of disability as proscribed by § 12184 and the applicable \n8 \n8  regulation.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12184; 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.5, 37.23; see also Doud v. Yellow Cab Co., \n9 \n9  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120243, *11-12 (D. Nev. Aug. 28, 2014).  Importantly, Plaintiffs do not \n10 \n10  need  to  show  that  Defendants  are  public  accommodations  or  operate  a  place  of  public \n11 \n11  accommodation to succeed on their ADA claim under § 12184.  \n12 \n12  III.  CONCLUSION \n13 \n13    Because Defendants’ alleged failure to provide transportation services to customers with \n14 \n14  service  animals  directly  implicates  the  ADA’s  statutory  and  regulatory  protections  for \n15 \n15  individuals with disabilities, the United States requests that this Court consider the Title III \n16 \n16  framework discussed in this Statement of Interest when analyzing the pending motion to dismiss.         \n17 \n17       \n18 \n \n18 \n19 \n19 \n20 \n20 \n21 \n21 \n22 \n22 \n23                                                             \n23  6 While coverage under Title III can be premised on either § 12182 or § 12184, these provisions \n24  are not mutually exclusive; entities to which § 12184 applies also may be subject to the public \n24  accommodations provision of Title III.  49 C.F.R. § 37.21; 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.21; see, \n25 \ne.g., Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119, 129 (2005) (“Although the statutory \n25 \ndefinitions of ‘public accommodation’ and ‘specified public transportation’ do not expressly \n26 \nmention cruise ships, there can be no serious doubt that the NCL cruise ships in question fall \n26 \n27  within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation.”).   \n27  - 7 - \n28           \n28  CASE NO. 3:14-cv-04086-NC  \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \n \n \n\nCase3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document29   Filed12/23/14   Page9 of 9\n1  Respectfully submitted this 22nd day of December, 2014.         \n                              \n2                \nMELINDA HAAG  VANITA GUPTA \n3 \nUnited States Attorney  Acting Assistant Attorney General \nNorthern District of California  Civil Rights Division \n4 \n   \n5          /s/ Sara Winslow        EVE L.

Nos. 185, 189 \n n\ndr 17 \nee\nth In this class action, plaintiffs National Federation of the Blind (“NFIB”) and various \nintr\nUo 18 \nN disabled individuals accused defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. of failing to accommodate \n19 \ntheir disabled customers traveling with service animals.  In 2016, the parties settled the \n20 \nclass action.  Plaintiffs now bring their second motion for attorneys’ fees and costs seeking \n21 \nreimbursement for their efforts monitoring Uber’s compliance with the settlement.  See \n22 \nDkt. No. 185.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to fees, but certain fees are \n23 \nunreasonable.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n24 \nPlaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. \n25 \nI.  Procedural History \n26 \nIn September 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this class action against Uber alleging \n27 \ndiscrimination against the blind under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \n28 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 2 of 15\n \n1  U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. and various California-law analogues.  See Dkt. No. 1.  The parties \n2  settled the case in January 2016 (see Dkt. No. 70; see also Dkt. No. 85-1 (“Settlement”)) \n3  and the Court granted final approval of the class settlement on December 6, 2016 (see Dkt. \n4  No. 139).  On December 15, 2016, the Court awarded Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees and costs \n5  pursuant to the Settlement.  See Dkt. Nos. 139, 144. \n6  Plaintiffs now seek additional attorneys’ fees and costs for resources expended in \n7  monitoring Uber’s settlement compliance.  See Dkt. No. 185.  Plaintiffs voluntarily agree \n8  to reduce their claimed amount by 5% across the board.  See id. at 19.1  Uber opposes, \n9  arguing that Plaintiffs are not entitled to additional fees and, even if they were, Plaintiffs’ \n10  request is unreasonable.  See generally Dkt. No. 187. \n11  II.  Settlement Agreement \na  12  Certain sections of the Settlement are relevant to this motion.  The Court \ntr in\nur\noo 13  summarizes those portions below. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  The Settlement requires Uber to “collect and report to Plaintiffs’ Counsel” rating \nrts fo\niD tc 15  and complaint information for riders with service animals.  See Settlement § 6.A.  Uber is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  required to report the raw data for that information to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  Id. § 6.B.1.  In \nS \n n\ndr 17  addition, if Plaintiffs’ Counsel provides Uber with a documented complaint of \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  discrimination by a rider, Uber is required to verify corresponding data and assign a unique \nN\n19  number identifier to the allegedly offending driver.  See id. § 6.B.2. \n20  NFIB is required to create a “compliance testing program” that uses blind testers \n21  with guide dogs using Uber’s UberX service to test compliance.  Id. § 6.C.  Uber agreed to \n22  pay NFIB $225,000 “to support the testing program.”  Id. § 11.A.  If the Settlement is \n23  extended, Uber is required to pay NFIB an additional $75,000 to support the program.  See \n24  id. §§ 7, 11.A. \n25  The Settlement also requires an appointment of a third-party Monitor.  See id. § 8.  \n26  Annually, the Monitor is obligated to “review and analyze” all data collected and reported \n27 \n                                              \n1 All page numbers reference the page numbers automatically generated by ECF unless \n28 \notherwise indicated. \n  2 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 3 of 15\n \n1  by Uber pursuant to Section 6 of the Settlement, in addition to “any other information \n2  provided to the Monitor by the Parties.”  Id.  The Monitor then reports to the Parties \n3  whether Uber substantially complied with the Settlement during the preceding year.  Id.  \n4  The Monitor is also required to “propose . . . further modifications to Uber’s policies, \n5  practices, and procedures” if such policies, practices, or procedures were insufficient to \n6  address discrimination.  Id. \n7  Lastly, the Settlement permits Plaintiffs to seek attorneys’ fees and costs incurred \n8  up through the effective date of the Settlement.  Id. § 11.C.  Uber agreed “not to dispute \n9  the entitlement to reasonable Attorneys’ Fees incurred up through the Effective Date of \n10  [the] Agreement[,]” but reserved the right to dispute the amount of fees requested.  Id.  For \n11  fees and costs related to “work performed after the time the Settlement Agreement is \na  12  signed by all Parties, including for work spent on compliance monitoring, enforcement, \ntr in\nur\noo 13  and/or work spent securing their fees[,]” Plaintiffs reserved their rights to pursue such fees, \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  but the Settlement acknowledged that “all issues pertaining to any such attorneys’ fees, \nrts fo\niD tc 15  costs, and expenses are unresolved . . . .”  Id. § 11.C.1.  The Parties are required to confer \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and negotiate as to any fees and costs related to Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s monitoring efforts \nS \n n\ndr 17  before petitioning the Court.  Id. § 11.C.2. \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  The Court retained jurisdiction.  See id. § 12; see also Dkt. No. 145. \nN\n19  III.  Discussion \n20  A.  Entitlement to Fees \nThe parties first dispute whether Plaintiffs are entitled to fees.  See Dkt. No. 187 at \n21 \n11.  According to Uber, the Settlement did not authorize attorneys’ fees for monitoring \n22 \nwork and the ADA’s fee-shifting statute does not allow such fees.  Id.  The Court \n23 \ndisagrees. \n24 \nIn Prison Legal News v. Scharzenegger, 608 F.3d 446 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth \n25 \nCircuit reaffirmed that “a party that prevails by obtaining a consent decree may recover \n26 \nattorneys’ fees under [42 U.S.C.] § 1988 for monitoring compliance with the decree, even \n27 \nwhen such monitoring does not result in any judicially sanctioned relief.”  Prison Legal \n28 \n  3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 4 of 15\n \n1  News, 608 F.3d at 451 (citing Keith v. Volpe, 833 F.2d 850, 855–57 (9th Cir. 1987)).  \n2  Thus, plaintiffs may recover attorneys’ fees for monitoring compliance with a settlement \n3  agreement under § 1988.  Id. at 452; see also Balla v. Idaho, 677 F.3d 910, 916 (9th Cir. \n4  2012) (“[M]onitoring fees not resulting in additional relief are allowable . . . .”). \n5  Uber contends that Prison Legal News and its progeny are inapposite because those \n6  cases concern a different fee shifting statute.  But § 1988 and the ADA’s fee-shifting \n7  statute, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, are virtually identical.  Compare 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (“the \n8  court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as \n9  part of the costs . . . .”) with 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (“the court or agency, in its discretion, may \n10  allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee, including litigation expenses, \n11  and costs . . . .”).  Uber has not identified any principled reason why the Court should \na  12  interpret the two statutes differently. \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Moreover, the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in Pennsylvania v. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546 (1986).  There, the court \nrts fo\niD tc 15  noted that the fee-shifting provisions of the Clean Air Act and § 1988 served “the common \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  purpose of . . . promot[ing] citizen enforcement of important federal policies,” such that \nS \n n\ndr 17  there was “no reason not to interpret both provisions governing attorney’s fees in the same \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  manner.”  Id. at 560.  The same is true of the ADA’s fee-shifting statute and § 1988.  See \nN\n19  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home v. W.V. Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, \n20  629–30 (2001) (“the . . . ADA fee-shifting prescriptions [were] modeled on 42 U.S.C. \n21  § 1988 unmodified . . . .”), superseded by statute on other grounds. \n22  Nor does the language of the Settlement foreclose attorneys’ fees for monitoring \n23  work.  Rather, the Settlement explicitly acknowledges that “all issues pertaining to” fees, \n24  costs, and expenses relating to “work performed after the time the Settlement Agreement is \n25  signed . . . including for work spent on compliance monitoring [and] enforcement” was an \n26  unresolved issue.  See Settlement § 11.C.1. \n27  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees \n28  incurred in connection with monitoring Uber’s compliance with the Settlement. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 5 of 15\n \n1  B.  Reasonableness of Fees \n2  Uber does not contest the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ claimed costs.  See Dkt. No. \n3  185 at 27 (requesting costs in the amount of $685.36).  Plaintiffs adequately documented \n4  those costs and they appear reasonable.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ \n5  requests for costs in the amount of $685.36. \n6  Uber also does not challenge Plaintiffs’ counsels’ claimed rates and, indeed, the \n7  Court previously approved Plaintiffs’ counsels’ rates.  See Dkt. No. 144.  As those rates \n8  have not changed, the Court FINDS that Plaintiffs’ counsels’ rates are reasonable.   \n9  Instead, Uber challenges five categories of Plaintiffs’ requested attorneys’ fees as \n10  unnecessary or unreasonable.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 14–22.  Uber also argues that Plaintiffs’ \n11  fees should be further reduced due to vague time entries and block billing.  Id. at 22–24.  \na  12  The Court will first address each category of contested fees, then turn to Uber’s objections.  \ntr in\nur\noo 13  See Dkt. No. 185-1, Ex. G (summary of claimed fees). \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  1.  Work Related to Conferring with Monitor \nrts fo\niD tc 15  In this category, Plaintiffs claim fees for hours spent (1) analyzing Uber’s data \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reports and (2) for work related to conferring with the Monitor about those reports.  See \nS \n n\ndr 17  Dkt. No. 185-1 (“Galvan Decl.”) ¶¶ 42–43.  Uber concedes that the hours spent analyzing \nee\nth\ninUtro 18  Uber’s reports are compensable,2 but argues that the hours spent for work relating to \nN\n19  conferring with the Monitor was unnecessary.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 15–16.  According to \n20  Uber, such work is not compensable because the Settlement limits Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n21  involvement with the Monitor’s review Uber’s data reports.  Id. at 15.  Specifically, Uber \n22  contends that the Settlement only contemplates review of its reports by Plaintiffs’ counsel \n23  and “formal analyses . . . or opining with or conferring with the Monitor about Uber’s data \n24  reports” is outside the scope of the Settlement.  Id. \n25  The Court disagrees.  While the Settlement explicitly requires Uber to provide \n26  Plaintiffs’ counsel with data reports for analysis (see Settlement §§ 6.A, 6.B.1), the \n27 \n                                              \n2 Uber argues that these hours should be reduced as they were block billed.  See Dkt. No. \n28 \n187 at 16.  The Court will address Plaintiffs’ block billing below. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 6 of 15\n \n1  Settlement does not limit Plaintiffs’ counsel’s involvement to that of a passive observer.  \n2  Rather, the Settlement requires the Monitor to consider “any other information provided,” \n3  suggesting by implication that Plaintiffs’ counsel are permitted to submit their own \n4  commentary on Uber’s data reports.  Id. § 8.  Accordingly, work conducted by Plaintiffs’ \n5  counsel relating to conferring with the Monitor is generally compensable. \n6  However, the fact that the Settlement permits Plaintiffs to supply their own \n7  commentary on Uber’s data reports to the Monitor is not a license to bill for wholly \n8  unnecessary work that is duplicative of Uber’s reports.  See Balla, 677 F.3d at 919 (“[T]he \n9  court [must] exercise discretion [to] assure that the case is not being milked by a monitor \n10  after the injunction has been obtained, for fees that are unreasonable in amount, for work \n11  not reasonably performed to enforce the relief, or for work not directly related to enforcing \na  12  the relief.”).  It is unclear, for example, why Plaintiffs need to draft, review, and submit \ntr in\nur\noo 13  declarations from individual complaining class members, particularly when there is no \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  indication that Plaintiffs believe Uber’s internal data keeping was inaccurate.  See, e.g., \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Galvan Decl., Ex. F, pt.1 at 101 (billing over 6 hours at $400 per hour to review or draft \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  class member declarations), 113 (reviewing and drafting various class member \nS \n n\ndr 17  declarations).  Further, Plaintiffs’ billing records for this category of work contain several \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  vague time entries, some of which have questionable billing value.  See, e.g., id. at 147 \nN\n19  (billing 0.8 hours at $275 per hour for “[m]aking a declaration, cover letter, and report \n20  accessible”).  Most of the hours, however, appear reasonable. \n21  Accordingly, the Court will reduce Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee for work relating to \n22  conferring with the Monitor by 10% in addition to Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% reduction.  The \n23  Court will not reduce Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee for analyzing Uber’s data beyond Plaintiffs’ \n24  voluntary 5% reduction.  Thus, Plaintiffs are entitled to $59,528.90 and $34,143.95 for \n25  these two sub-categories of work, respectively. \n26  2.  Work Related to Communicating with Class Members \n27  This category contains three sub-categories of work: (1) communicating with class \n28  members to address and respond to discrimination complaints; (2) submitting information \n  6 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 7 of 15\n \n1  requests to Uber pursuant to the Settlement’s process (see Settlement § 6.B.2); and (3) \n2  following up with class members who participated in NFIB’s compliance testing program \n3  (see id. § 6.C).  Uber concedes that the second sub-category of work is compensable but \n4  argues that the first and third sub-categories are not.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 16. \n5  As to the first sub-category of work—communicating with class members to \n6  address and respond to discrimination complaints—Uber is correct that Plaintiffs should \n7  not be compensated to the extent they are merely creating a parallel complaint \n8  investigations process.  The Settlement itself already creates a procedure for class \n9  members to raise discrimination complaints—a procedure hailed by Plaintiffs as a \n10  significant boon for the class.  See Dkt. No. 84. \n11  This does not mean, however, that Plaintiffs’ counsel is required to sit on their \na  12  hands and rubber-stamp Uber’s efforts.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s obligations to the class \ntr in\nur\noo 13  requires them to take an active role in ensuring that the Settlement is working as intended.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  And communicating with class members regarding Uber’s behavior is the core of \nrts fo\niD tc 15  monitoring efforts.  In Prison Legal News, for example, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  attorneys’ fees for “reviewing and responding to letters from [class members] complaining \nS \n n\ndr 17  about” the defendants’ failure to comply with the settlement.  Prison Legal News, 608 F.3d \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  at 453.  The Ninth Circuit noted that “[w]ithout such correspondence [with class \nN\n19  members], it would be difficult for [plaintiffs] to discover or document violations of the \n20  terms of the settlement.”  Id. \n21  Upon review of Plaintiffs’ records, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs’ \n22  communication with class members regarding their discrimination complaints is limited to \n23  compiling information relating to their monitoring efforts and does not create a parallel \n24  track for investigating complaints. \n25  As to the third sub-category of work—communications with class members who \n26  participated in NFIB’s compliance testing program—the Court agrees with Uber.  \n27  Plaintiffs have already been compensated for work related to NFIB’s compliance testing \n28  program.  Section 11.A of the Settlement requires Uber to pay NFIB $225,000 “to support \n  7 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 8 of 15\n \n1  the testing program.”  Such payments naturally encompass fees and costs incurred in \n2  reviewing program data or following up with program participants.  Plaintiffs may not \n3  double-dip for the compliance testing program.  Disallowed amounts are listed in the chart \n4  below.3  Although some of these entries were coded by Plaintiffs as “Settlement \n5  Modifications” work, the Court compiles all disallowed NFIB-related hours here: \n6  Page \nDate of  Claimed  Claimed \n7  Entry Description  Number of \nEntry  Time  Amount \n8  Entry \n9  Prepare final language for message \n10  to intakes and NFB testing  2/2/2018  0.40  $216  5 \n11  participants who reported denials \na  12 \ntr in Analysis of NFB testing ride data  2/23/2018  1.10  $385  17 \nur\noo 13 \nCfi\n tla Phone call with T Elder re NFB \nciC 14  4/2/2018  0.70  $329  26 \nrts fo testing and follow up re same \niD tc 15 \n seirt Reviewing Uber NFB testing data  4/2/2018  1.30  $611  26 \ntatsiD 16 \nS  n Phone call with T Elder and M \ndr 17 \nee\nth\nintr Nunez regarding additional \nUo 18 \nN 9/14/2018  1.00  $470  75 \ninformation sharing, NFB testing, \n19 \nand next steps \n20 \nDiscussing internal next steps with \n21 \nS Seaborn regarding information  9/14/2018  1.00  $470  75 \n22 \nsharing and NFB testing \n23 \nCase strategy re NFB testing \n24 \n9/28/2018  0.10  $47  78 \ndiscussion with S Seaborn \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27 \n3 Entries are drawn from Galvan Decl., Ex.

This amounts to $66,357.50. \ntatsiD 16 \nS  n 3.  Work Relating to Unwarranted or Abandoned Modifications \ndr 17 \nee\nth\nintr In this category, Plaintiffs seek attorneys’ fees relating to their efforts to modify the \nUo 18 \nN\nSettlement in three ways: (1) policies relating to Uber’s UberPool service; (2) seeking \n19 \nquarterly data extension; and (3) requesting further data sharing provisions.  Uber \n20 \nconcedes that the second sub-category of fees relating to quarterly data extensions are \n21 \ncompensable.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 18, 20.  The first and third sub-category, according to \n22 \nUber, are not compensable because those proposals were unnecessary or not accepted. \n23 \nFirst, the Court rejects Uber’s argument that those hours are not compensable \n24 \nbecause the Settlement has been effective.  Disallowing monitoring fees because Plaintiffs \n25 \nwere successful in negotiating and crafting a successful settlement would be counter-\n26 \nproductive.  Monitoring fees are permissible so long as they are not unreasonable and are \n27 \nrelated to enforcing the settlement.  See Balla, 677 F.3d at 919. \n28 \n  10 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 11 of 15\n \n1  Second, Uber concedes that Plaintiffs’ proposed modifications to its UberPool \n2  program and the data sharing provisions of the Settlement have been adopted “in a very \n3  limited fashion voluntarily by Uber.”  Dkt. No. 187 at 19.  But Plaintiffs are not required to \n4  achieve complete victory nor were they required to obtain a court order or official \n5  modification to be entitled to fees.  In Balla, Ninth Circuit affirmed modification fees even \n6  though the plaintiffs’ motion to hold the defendant in contempt was denied because \n7  plaintiffs’ motion practice “played a key role in resolving” the underlying issue.  Balla, \n8  677 F.3d at 920 (quotations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit noted that “[i]f in a battle to take a \n9  hill, the adversary flees instead of fighting to a bloody defeat, the taking of the hill makes \n10  the battle a victory.”  Id. \n11  Here, Plaintiffs’ efforts were ultimately successful as to their UberPool and data \na  12  sharing proposals.  Plaintiffs only seek fees connected to those proposals.  After reviewing \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Plaintiffs’ records, the billed amounts appear reasonable.  Less Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  reduction, Plaintiffs are entitled to $55,862.37 for this category of work.4 \nrts fo\niD tc 15  4.  Other Direct Monitoring Work \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  This category of work includes (1) responding to inquiries from the United States \nS \n n\ndr 17  Department of Justice regarding the Settlement; (2) investigating Uber’s filings with the \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  California Public Utilities Commission, arbitrations of service animal issues, and other \nN\n19  similar developments; (3) corresponding with Uber to verify compliance with Settlement \n20  requirements; and (4) conferring with a consultant regarding evaluating the efficacy of the \n21  Settlement at reducing discrimination against class members. \n22  Here, Uber simply argues that this work is not compensable because these tasks \n23  were “[too] attenuated” from the Settlement.  Dkt. No. 185 at 21.  The Court is not \n24  convinced.  Corresponding with and investigating actions taken by regulatory bodies \n25  responsible for discrimination complaints is well within the scope of monitoring \n26 \n                                              \n27 \n4 As mentioned in footnote 3, supra, some entries block billed NFIB-testing-program-\nrelated work and UberPool work.  Because the Court already eliminated those fees—$801 \n28 \nin total—it does not do so again here. \n  11 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 12 of 15\n \n1  compliance with a discrimination-related settlement.  Likewise, Uber is entitled to \n2  reasonable consultant fees to evaluate whether the Settlement is working as intended. \n3  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees for their direct monitoring \n4  work less their voluntary 5% reduction in fees.  This amounts to $13,130.90. \n5  5.  Fees Relating to Plaintiffs’ Unfiled Attorneys’ Fee Motion \n6  The final category of fees relates to work expended by Plaintiffs’ counsel on an \n7  unfiled fees motion.  In March 2018, the parties began negotiating Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n8  attorneys’ fees for work conducted in 2017.  See Gavlan Decl. ¶¶ 64–70; Dkt. No. 187-1 \n9  (“Spurchise Decl.”) ¶¶ 4–5.  Under the Settlement, the parties are required to negotiate \n10  such fees within 60 days before seeking Court intervention.  See Settlement § 11.C.2.  The \n11  parties initially failed to come to an agreement within the 60-day limit, but ultimately \na  12  settled the dispute by July 2, 2018.  See Gavlan Decl. ¶¶ 67–69; Spurchise Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.  \ntr in\nur\noo 13  The fees motion was thus never filed. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Given the Settlement’s requirement that the parties negotiate their fees dispute, it \nrts fo\niD tc 15  was unreasonable for Plaintiffs to bill for hours preparing a fee motion prior to April 30, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2018—the end of the 60-day negotiation period.  Once it became clear that no settlement \nS \n n\ndr 17  was forthcoming, however, Plaintiffs were entitled to begin preparing their fees motion \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  and are entitled to fees for time spent accordingly.  Thus, the Court disallows all fees billed \nN\n19  prior to April 30, 2018, less Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% reduction.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \n20  entitled to $4,393.75 in fees and costs for their unfiled fees motion.  See Gavlan Decl., Ex. \n21  F, pt. 2 at 7–12. \n22  6.  Specific Challenges to Hours \n23  Uber challenges 13.2 hours as unduly vague and an additional 137.7 hours for \n24  impermissible block billing.5  The Court first addresses Uber’s vagueness challenges \n25  before turning to the alleged block-billed hours. \n26 \n                                              \n5 In accompanying exhibits, Uber appears to argue that certain of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n27 \nbilled hours were duplicative or clerical work in disguise.  See Spurchise Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. \n3.  Uber’s opposition, however, does not challenge those hours.  And, in any case, review \n28 \nof those entries does not suggest that they are duplicative or clerical. \n  12 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 13 of 15\n \n1  When submitting entries for attorneys’ fee awards, attorneys are “not required to \n2  record in great detail how each minute of [their] time was expended.”  Hensley v. \n3  Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 n.12 (1983).  Attorneys need only “keep records in sufficient \n4  detail that a neutral judge can make a fair evaluation of the time expended, the nature and \n5  need for the service, and the reasonable fees to be allowed.”  Id. at 441 (Burger, C.J., \n6  concurring); United Steelworkers of Am. v. Ret. Income Plan For Hourly-Rated Employees \n7  of ASARCO, Inc., 512 F.3d 555, 565 (9th Cir. 2008). \n8  The Court reviewed the entries Uber identified as vague.  See Dkt. No. 187-6.

Metro. Life Ins. Co., 480 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. \n4  2007).  Block billing is not per se unreasonable and “has been accepted in this district.”  \n5  PQ Labs, Inc. v. Qi, No. 12-cv-00450 CW, 2015 WL 224970, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 16, \n6  2015) (citing Stonebrae, L.P. v. Toll Bros., Inc., No. 08-cv-00221 EMC, 2011 WL \n7  1334444, at *8 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 7, 2011) (“Block-billing is a typical practice in this district, \n8  and blocked-bills have been found to provide a sufficient basis for calculating a fee \n9  award.”)).  However, the block-billing party seeking fees must still meet the basic \n10  requirements of “listing his hours and identifying the general subject matter of his time \n11  expenditures.”  Garcia v. Resurgent Capital Servs., L.P., No. 11-cv-01253 EMC, 2012 WL \na  12  3778852, at *8 (N.D. Cal.

Inc., \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  214 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 2000). \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Here, the Court finds that the alleged block-billed entries “contain enough \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  specificity as to individual tasks to ascertain whether the amount of time spent performing \nS \n n\ndr 17  them was reasonable.”  Garcia, 2012 WL 3778852, at *8.  Because the block-billed entries \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  are adequately detailed to permit the Court to assess the reasonableness of hours expended, \nN\n19  the Court finds that plaintiffs’ counsel have sufficiently documented their hours; no \n20  reduction is necessary on this basis. \n21  C.  Motion to Seal \n22  Plaintiffs move to seal two exhibits containing a chart and graph detailing the \n23  number of service-animal-related complaints received by Uber on a month-to-month basis.  \n24  See Dkt. No. 189-5.  Plaintiffs also seek to redact two portions of their reply referencing \n25  that information.  See Dkt. No. 189-4 at 13.  Notably, the information sought to be sealed \n26  are merely information derived from Uber’s data reports, not the reports themselves. \n27  Local Rule 79-5(e)(1) requires the party designating a document as confidential to \n28  “file a declaration as required by [Local Rule] 79-5(d)(1)(A) establishing that all of the \n  14 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 193   Filed 09/27/19   Page 15 of 15\n \n1  designated material is sealable” within four days of the filing of the motion to seal.  Local \n2  Rule 79-5(d)(1)(A) further explains that merely “[r]eferenc[ing] a stipulation or protective \n3  order that allows a party to designate certain documents as confidential is not sufficient to \n4  establish that a document, or portions thereof, are sealable.”  See also Kamakana v. City & \n5  Cty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2006) (listing grounds establishing \n6  “compelling reasons” to seal court files). \n7  Plaintiffs filed their motion to seal and served their motion on Uber on August 30, \n8  2019.  See Dkt. Nos. 189, 191.  Because more than four days have passed since Plaintiffs \n9  filed their motion and Uber has not filed a declaration explaining why the derived \n10  information contained in the exhibits or the reply is confidential, the Court DENIES the \n11  administrative motion to seal without prejudice.  Plaintiffs must file the documents in the \na  12  public record by October 11, 2019.  See N.D. Cal. Local Rule 79-5(e)(2). \ntr in\nur\noo 13  IV.  Conclusion \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs.  Plaintiffs are \nrts fo\niD tc 15  entitled to $230,592.37 in attorneys’ fees and $685.36 in costs for a total award of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  $231,277.73.  Uber must pay the award within 14 days of this order. \nS \n n\ndr 17  The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to seal.

This class action seeks to put an end to violations of the ADA committed by Uber \n3  Technologies, Inc., as well as its subsidiary and affiliate entities nationwide (collectively “Uber” \n4  or “Defendant”) against blind individuals who use guide dogs. Plaintiffs National Federation of \n5  the Blind (“NFB”) and National Federation of the Blind of California (“NFB-CA”) sue on behalf \n6  of their members, including Plaintiff Kelly, who has been and will continue to be denied access \n7  to transportation services arranged through the Uber mobile software application (“Uber \n8  transportation services”) and Plaintiff Hingson, who has been and continues to be deterred from \n9  using Uber transportation services, all because Uber has failed to ensure that blind riders with \n10  service animals, including many other members of Plaintiffs NFB and NFB-CA, can access Uber \n11  transportation services. Likewise, Michael Pedersen, a blind resident of San Francisco who uses \n12  a guide dog, also sues alongside Plaintiffs NFB and NFB-CA because Pedersen has been and \nATES  LOOR1204  13   w ill  continue to be denied access to Uber transportation services on the basis of his using a \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  servic e animal. \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     th  e U  n it2 e.d   StateUsb. e Tr roafnfesrpso artcacteiosns  taor rtarnangsepdo trhtarotiuognh s tehrev iUcebse fro mr osibgihlete sdo fintwdiavried aupaplsl itchartoioung h(“oaupt p”) \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   pisa  hssigenhglye rcso asnt-de fiftesc ftlieveet  aonf dd rwivideersly i na vmauilcahb lteh.e U sbamere u wseasy t hthea at pap t atox ia drriasnpgatec hri daerrsa bnegtews ereidne s for \n \n19  customers. \n20  3.  Drivers who use the Uber app (“drivers”) are refusing to transport many blind \n21  individuals who use service animals, including members of NFB and NFB-CA. One driver \n22  denied rides to one blind woman on twelve separate occasions, while other drivers have refused \n23  service to a blind parent on her way to a pharmacy to get a prescription for her feverish toddler, \n24  abandoned blind travelers in extreme weather, and cancelled rides for discriminatory purposes \n25  and then charged the riders cancellation fees, all because these individuals were using guide \n26  dogs. Drivers have refused to transport Jamey Gump, Manveen Chahal, Cody Austin Meyer, \n27  Brooklyn Rodden, Michael Kelly, Jessie Lorenz, Jonathan Lyens, and Juanita Herrera (all blind \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

In total, Plaintiffs are aware of \n2  more than 150 instances where drivers on the Uber platform refused to transport blind \n3  individuals with service animals. Drivers who refused to transport these blind individuals did so \n4  after they initially agreed to transport the riders. The Drivers denied the requested transportation \n5  service after the drivers had arrived and discovered that the riders used service animals.  \n6  4.  In addition, some drivers mishandle guide dogs, harass blind customers with \n7  guide dogs, or give low feedback scores to passengers with service animals even when drivers do \n8  not outright deny the provision of transportation service. Blind customers with guide dogs have \n9  been yelled at by drivers who are hostile toward their guide dogs. In addition, upon information \n10  and belief, passengers with service animals receive lower average ratings from drivers. A lower \n11  rating reduces the probability that a driver will agree to provide transportation to a passenger in \n12  the future. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      5.

Mr. Hingson has \n4  been deterred from using Uber on many specific occasions when it would have been convenient \n5  for him to use Uber’s app to arrange transportation.  \n6  8.  Plaintiff Pedersen is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a resident of San Francisco, \n7  California. Mr. Pedersen has been denied access to Uber transportation services multiple times. \n8  Mr. Pedersen would like to continue using Uber transportation services without fear that drivers \n9  will refuse to drive him. \n10  9.  When drivers deny rides to blind riders with service animals, blind individuals \n11  experience several harms. They face unexpected delays, they must arrange alternate \n12  transportation that is sometimes more costly, and they face the degrading experience of being \nATES  LOOR1204  13   de n ied a basic service that is available to all other paying customers.  \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   10.

Uber and other similar services are a critical transportation option for many blind \n25  individuals. Due to distances between destinations and the limitations of public transportation \n26  and paratransit, many blind persons must use transportation network company services to travel \n27  from one place to another.

Due to the public’s widespread adoption of smart phones, Uber and other \n6  transportation network companies are quickly supplanting traditional taxi companies and \n7  becoming the public’s primary option for on-demand transportation services.

Plaintiff NFB, a national membership organization of blind persons, is a nonprofit \n6  corporation duly organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, with its principal place of \n7  business in Baltimore, Maryland.

Plaintiff Michael Kelly is blind, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB and NFB-\n25  CA, and currently resides in Sacramento, California. Mr. Kelly is a musician and virtuoso \n26  electric bassist.

Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc., a for-profit technology company based in \n6  California engineers a smart phone software application to arrange rides between passengers and \n7  drivers in much the same way that a taxi dispatch arranges rides for customers. Uber’s customers \n8  request rides through Uber; the Uber app identifies an available driver to transport each \n9  customer; the Uber app bills customers for their rides in Uber vehicles; Uber provides customers \n10  with receipts; and Uber handles inquiries and complaints from customers concerning drivers and \n11  transportation services.  \n12  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nATES  LOOR1204  13      29.

The case arises out of Defendant’s policies and practices of permitting ongoing \n24  discrimination against guide dog users by individual drivers, of failing to implement protections \n25  to ensure that drivers understand and comply with anti-discrimination law, and of failing to \n26  provide adequate support and recourse to riders who are discriminated against.  \n27  33.

Class certification of the claims is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R.

Uber has developed mobile software applications for iPhones, Android \n23  phones, and Windows phones that customers use to request transportation from Uber for \n24  themselves and/or guests. A vehicle on the Uber platform is able to transport a single passenger \n25  or group of passengers traveling together up to the safe capacity of the requested vehicle, which \n26  is usually no more than four passengers. \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

To use one of the Uber transportation services, a customer submits a request on \n2  behalf of himself or other passengers through one of Uber’s platforms available on the app. Once \n3  Uber identifies the closest available vehicle, Uber notifies the requester either by text message or \n4  through its smart phone application. The notification includes the driver’s name, customer rating, \n5  phone number, vehicle license plate number, make and model of the vehicle, and the driver’s \n6  estimated time of arrival. Uber’s mobile application allows the requesting customer to track the \n7  vehicle’s location as the driver navigates to the requesting customer’s identified pick-up address. \n8  Requesting customers may also submit the desired trip destination through Uber’s mobile \n9  application. \n10  39.  The Uber app notifies the requesting customer once his or her vehicle has arrived. \n11  The requester or any other associated passengers may then board the vehicle. If the requesting \n12  customer submitted the destination address, the app will supply the driver with turn-by-turn \nATES  LOOR1204  13   di re ctions to the desired destination.

Customers cannot access the Uber platform by \n2  physically hailing an Uber vehicle on the street. \n3  42.  Uber has requirements for the type and age of the vehicle that drivers may use to \n4  operate on the Uber app. In addition, in some jurisdictions, the vehicle a driver uses while on the \n5  Uber platform must pass an inspection.  \n6  43.  Uber records many details about the demand-responsive transportation services \n7  that drivers provide, including for each trip: (1) the pickup location, (2) the time of pickup, (3) \n8  the drop off location, (4) the time of drop off, (5) the distance traveled, (6) the trip duration, and \n9  (7) the customer’s identity. Uber periodically reviews the driving records of drivers. Uber also \n10  asks customers for written feedback after every ride that a driver provides, and Uber routinely \n11  follows up with customers who express dissatisfaction. Customers who wish to lodge complaints \n12  concerning drivers do so by contacting Uber.  \nATES  LOOR1204  13      44.

Customers do not pay drivers of Uber vehicles in cash.

Uber keeps a percentage of each fare. Thus, Uber remits fares to drivers based on the \n25  duration and distance of the trips that they provide to passengers. Payments are not transferred \n26  directly from customers to drivers; rather, Uber collects and holds customer payments, deducts \n27  fees, and then later transfers money to drivers.  \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

The Commission \n3  requires that Uber possess a Class P Charter Party Carrier permit issued by the Commission to \n4  operate the UberX service in California. The Commission stated that Uber may not discriminate \n5  against people with disabilities in the operation of the UberX transportation service and required \n6  that Uber’s website and mobile applications comply with Level AA of version 2.0 of the Web \n7  Content Accessibility Guidelines. \n8  47.

Mr. Gump had planned to leave on a trip early the next morning and requested an \n3  UberX ride to get to his home in Menlo Park because of the late hour. After the requested vehicle \n4  had pulled up to the curb, Mr. Gump and Mr. Chahal attempted to enter the vehicle and opened a \n5  passenger door. The driver began shouting “no dogs!” Mr. Gump tried to explain that their dogs \n6  were service animals for their disabilities and were legally allowed in the vehicle. The driver \n7  began shouting and cursing at Mr. Gump and Mr. Chahal in a language that Mr. Gump did not \n8  understand. Mr. Chahal speaks the language and was offended by the profanity and insults. As \n9  Mr. Gump attempted to enter the vehicle, the driver quickly accelerated the vehicle forward, \n10  nearly injuring Mr. Gump’s guide dog and causing an open passenger door to strike Mr. Chahal. \n11  The driver then sped away and cancelled the ride request.

Again, a few seconds after Mr. Gump received confirmation that this same driver \n23  was on the way, the driver cancelled on him for a second time.  \n24  52.  Mr. Gump wants to use the Uber application because it is available near his home, \n25  an area with limited public transportation, and it would be convenient if it was reliably accessible \n26  and non-discriminatory. However, after these experiences, he has been hesitant to use Uber so \n27  frequently because he concluded that it is not a reliable transportation option for him. \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Cody Austin Meyer is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB and NFB-\n7  CA. A driver refused to transport Mr. Meyer on September 30, 2014. On that occasion, Mr. \n8  Meyer was shopping at a grocery store in the Mission Valley Shopping Center in Fremont, \n9  California and needed a way to transport his groceries back to his apartment. Mr. Meyer used the \n10  Uber iPhone app to request a vehicle. A driver was assigned to pick Mr. Meyer up at the \n11  shopping center. Mr. Meyer was standing on the curb in the shopping center waiting for the \n12  driver when Mr. Meyer noticed a vehicle pull up near where he was standing and remain inactive \nATES  LOOR1204  13   fo r  an extended period of time.

A driver arranged using the Uber app refused to transport her and her boyfriend, Plaintiff \n5  Michael Kelly, who also uses a service animal, on or about September 13, 2014. On that \n6  occasion, Ms. Rodden used her Uber app to request a vehicle so that she and Plaintiff Kelly \n7  could go out to dinner at Chicago Fire Pizza, a local pizza parlor in Sacramento, California. \n8  When the requested driver arrived, Ms. Rodden and Plaintiff Kelly attempted to enter the vehicle \n9  with their service animals and were refused access by the driver. Though Ms. Rodden and \n10  Plaintiff Kelly explained that the driver’s conduct was illegal, the driver maintained his refusal to \n11  transport them because of their service animals and then drove away.  \n12  56.

On or about 8:30 a.m. on that date, Mr. Lyens requested UberX \n26  transportation from his home in San Francisco.

The app then notified Mr. Lyens that the driver had cancelled his ride, \n4  and Mr. Lyens observed the vehicle in front of his home leave. As a result of this cancellation, \n5  Mr. Lyens had to pay a higher fare for transportation to his interview. He was also late to his \n6  interview because of the delay.  \n7  58.  Juanita Herrera is a blind college student, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB \n8  and NFB-CA, and resides in Southern California. Ms. Herrera is interested in using the UberX \n9  service because it is more convenient and affordable than other taxi options. She attempted to use \n10  the UberX service for the first time on August 7, 2014. She requested a ride from the Macy’s \n11  store located at 6200 Slauson Avenue in Culver City, California. She was standing in front of the \n12  store waiting for her requested ride when a driver approached her and asked if she was waiting \nATES  LOOR1204  13   fo r  an Uber.

Drivers \n22  have refused to transport Mr. Schulenburg on at least five separate occasions in several \n23  California cities, including Santa Clara, San Jose, Campbell, and Sacramento, because of his \n24  guide dog. When these drivers were willing to speak with him, Mr. Schulenburg explained to the \n25  drivers that he had the legal right to bring his service animal with him, but the drivers ignored his \n26  explanations, and many of the drivers informed him that they had not received training \n27  concerning service animals. In addition, Uber has charged him cancellation fees after some \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

When drivers have refused to transport Mr. \n3  Schulenburg, he has faced delays of up to thirty minutes as he awaits alternative transportation. \n4  Mr. Schulenburg has submitted written complaints about these instances of discrimination to \n5  Uber. However, Uber has failed to inform Mr. Schulenburg whether Uber took any steps to \n6  ensure that these drivers would not unlawfully discriminate against him again or other \n7  individuals with service animals. Instead, Uber responded to some of Mr. Schulenburg’s \n8  complaints by stating that Uber cannot control its drivers’ conduct because the drivers are \n9  independent contractors and by advising Mr. Schulenburg that he should inform drivers of their \n10  legal obligation to allow his service animal to accompany him.  \n11  60.

Mr. Rueda \n12  attended the annual convention for NFB-CA, which was held in Southern California on October \nATES  LOOR1204  13   9- 12 , 2014.

On that occasion, Mr. Foley used \n5  the Uber app to request an UberX ride from his place of work in Berkeley, California on his way \n6  to an appointment. He waited for his ride in front of the building. The Uber app notified Mr. \n7  Foley that his vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, was arriving, and a few seconds later a car pulled up \n8  about ten feet from him. Mr. Foley proceeded to the car, reached for the door, and shouted \n9  “Uber?” The car then drove away. Approximately 30 seconds later, the Uber app informed Mr. \n10  Foley that the driver had cancelled his ride. Mr. Foley then conferred with a sighted individual at \n11  a nearby bus stop who confirmed that the car that just drove away was a Toyota Corolla and that \n12  the driver looked at Mr. Foley and his guide dog shortly before leaving the scene.

Dimitrios Kouniaris is blind and uses a guide dog. During August 2014, drivers \n5  refused to transport Mr. Kouniaris on two occasions in Austin, Texas because of his service \n6  animal. On both occasions, Mr. Kouniaris was stranded in temperatures of over 100 °F as he \n7  waited for alternative transportation. Uber also charged Mr. Kouniaris a cancellation fee and \n8  only refunded it after he complained. Mr. Kouniaris has since stopped using the UberX service \n9  because he does not want to face the risk that additional drivers will refuse to transport him or \n10  mistreat him because of his service animal. However, Mr. Kouniaris wants safe reliable access to \n11  the UberX service. \n12  69.

Drivers can also review an assigned \n20  passenger’s average rating by other drivers before deciding whether to travel to pick up that \n21  assigned passenger.

This creates a system in which blind passengers \n25  with service animals have fewer options to connect with drivers. \n26  71.  Many of the preceding blind individuals submitted written complaints to Uber \n27  concerning the discriminatory treatment that they had experienced.

Mr. Hingson learned that drivers often \n20  refuse to transport blind individuals with service animals. Because of Mr. Hingson’s position as \n21  Vice President of the National Association of Guide Dog Users and his longstanding \n22  involvement with membership activities within NFB-CA, he has specific and general knowledge \n23  of the experiences of multiple Uber passengers with service animals who have been denied \n24  access. Through his regular contact with members of NFB-CA and other members of the blind \n25  community, Mr. Hingson has known of specific refusals by drivers to transport individuals with \n26  guide dogs over the past year. Additionally, through his activities with NFB-CA, Mr. Hingson \n27  regularly attends events where fellow blind attendees with service animals are having trouble \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

For example, Mr. Hingson attended the annual state convention for NFB-\n2  CA, which was held at the Embassy Suites South, El Segundo, CA, on October 9-12, 2014. Mr. \n3  Hingson met convention attendees with service animals who were experiencing denials when \n4  attempting to use UberX to travel to and from the convention hotel. Mr. Hingson has refrained \n5  and continues to refrain from creating an Uber user account or otherwise using Uber \n6  transportation services because he fears experiencing similar discrimination.  \n7  74.  Mr. Hingson was deterred from using Uber on many specific occasions. For \n8  example, on or about December 5, 2013, Mr. Hingson was planning to travel to a job interview \n9  at an executive recruiting firm in San Francisco. At that time, Mr. Hingson was aware that Uber \n10  was available in San Francisco. However, because of a tight schedule, Mr. Hingson decided not \n11  to attempt to use the UberX service because he could not afford to be delayed by a driver \n12  refusing to take his guide dog. Instead, Mr. Hingson arranged for a taxicab well in advance of his \nATES  LOOR1204  13   tr an sit and extended his trip so that he could use nondiscriminatory transportation services to \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  travel  to his appointment on time.  \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     th  at   oc c7 a5si. o n, MPlra. iHntiinffg sHoinn gnseoend ewda tso  fquurtihcekrl yd etrtaevrreeld f rforomm t hues iFnegr rUyb Beur ioldni nJagn iuna Srya n2 0F,r 2an0c1i4s.c Oo nto  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   aim  sppoeartkainntg p ernogfeasgseiomneanl te antg Wageelmlse Fnat.r gMo.r .M Hri.n Hgsinogns wona nctoeudl dto n uoste r iUskb earrXri vbiencga luastee  ofof ri ttsh igse neral \n \n19  convenience and the quality of the vehicles. However, he was deterred from doing so because he \n20  did not want to wait for the vehicle to arrive and then discover that the driver would refuse to \n21  take his service animal.  \n22  76.  Plaintiff Hingson was similarly deterred from using Uber on or about May 15, \n23  2014. Mr. Hingson needed to travel within San Francisco to a meeting with a press contact. Mr. \n24  Hingson wanted to use UberX to attend this meeting. However, Mr. Hingson wanted to be \n25  focused for this meeting and believed the stress of encountering a driver that refused to transport \n26  his service animal would cause him stress and negatively affect his performance at the meeting.  \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Likewise, on or about September 28, 2014, Mr. Hingson traveled from Los \n2  Angeles to San Francisco to attend meetings with marketing consultants for the purpose of \n3  filming video footage. Mr. Hingson needed to coordinate his travel schedule with airline flights \n4  and maximize his time with these consultants during the trip. He wanted to use the UberX \n5  service, but could not afford to waste unnecessary time in transit caused by a driver refusing to \n6  take his service animal.  \n7  78.  Plaintiff Hingson would like to use Uber for future travel. Mr. Hingson travels \n8  extensively and would like to use Uber transportation services on upcoming trips. However, \n9  Uber is currently not a reliable source of transportation for Mr. Hingson because of the risk that a \n10  driver will refuse to transport him and his service animal. Mr. Hingson hopes that Uber will take \n11  responsibility for the conduct of drivers and prevent and minimize discrimination. Mr. Hingson \n12  would use Uber if Uber properly informed drivers of their legal obligations, adopted and \nATES  LOOR1204  13   en fo rced effective antidiscrimination policies, and provided blind passengers a convenient way \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  to imm ediately report discrimination so that he has some assurance that Uber will be as reliable \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     an  d   co n7 v9e.n  ientP floari nhtiimff  Panedd ehrisse ng uisid bel idnodg,  uass eist  ias  gfuoird oet hdeorgs,.  a nd resides in San Francisco, \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   Cw aolrikfo. rOnviae.r  Mthre.

For example, on or about September 12, 2014, Mr. Pedersen’s wife used her Uber \n21  account to request a vehicle for Mr. Pedersen as he was preparing to leave for work in the \n22  morning. Mr. Pedersen heard that the driver had pulled up in front of his home and went outside \n23  to enter the vehicle. Mr. Pedersen knocked on the window of the vehicle and asked, “Uber?” The \n24  driver said, “yes, but I don’t take dogs.” Mr. Pedersen explained that his dog was a service \n25  animal and the driver was legally required to transport him. The driver replied, “I don’t care. It’s \n26  not my problem.” The driver then drove away and canceled the trip request. Mr. Pedersen’s wife \n27  was charged a $5 cancellation fee. Mr. Pedersen then used Flywheel, a competing service, to \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Because of the delay caused by the driver, Mr. Pedersen missed \n2  his connection to a commuter shuttle and was late for work. Mr. Pedersen would like to keep \n3  using Uber without fear that he will be denied service and made late for work or other \n4  appointments. Mr. Pedersen wants Uber to change its policies and practices so that he can enjoy \n5  the same reliability and convenience that other riders without service animals enjoy. \n6  81.  Uber is violating basic equal access requirements under both the ADA and state \n7  law by failing to implement policies and procedures that would prevent or reduce discrimination \n8  against blind riders committed by drivers. Uber can adopt and enforce policies and procedures \n9  that would prevent or reduce discrimination against blind individuals with service animals, \n10  including Plaintiffs.  These policies would include, but are not limited to, the following: \n11  1.  Provide an accessible method for blind individuals with service dogs to \n12  immediately and efficiently report instances where drivers refuse to transport \nATES  LOOR1204  13      them on the basis of disability;  \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14    2.

By operating a service that dispatches drivers who unlawfully discriminate and \n4  refuse to transport blind individuals with service animals and by operating a customer rating \n5  system that, on information and belief, reduces the number of  drivers available to Plaintiffs and \n6  other blind customers with service animals, Defendant violates Title III of the ADA because \n7  Defendant screens out or tends to screen out Plaintiffs and other blind individuals with guide \n8  dogs from fully enjoying the Uber platform.  42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(1); 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(a). \n9  89.  It is a violation of Title III for private entities providing specified public \n10  transportation to fail to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when \n11  such modifications are necessary to afford the entity’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n12  advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate \nATES  LOOR1204  13   th at  making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  facilit ies, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12184(b)(2)(a), \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     12  1  82 (b9 )0(2.  )(a)(Biiy); f 4ai9l iCng.F t.oR m. §o 3d7if.y5 (pfr)a; c2t8ic Ces.,F p.Ro.l i§c i3es6,. 3a0n2d( pa)r.o cedures to ensure that drivers on \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   tahn ei mUables,r  Dpleaftefondrman dt ois n doetn ryeifnugs eP tloa itnrtainffssp fourltl P alnadin etiqfufsa la nacdc oetshse tro b tlhine ds pinedciifviieddu palusb wlicit h service \n \n19  transportation offered through Defendant’s app. \n20  91.

Defendant violates Title III of the ADA by refusing to provide transportation \n2  services to blind individuals with service animals, including Plaintiffs, who can physically access \n3  vehicles on the Uber platform. Defendant therefore violates Title III of the ADA by denying \n4  Plaintiffs full and equal access to the services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n5  accommodations of Defendant’s service. \n6  94.

Title III prohibits entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places of public \n7  accommodation from excluding, on the basis of disability, individuals with disabilities from \n8  participating in or benefiting from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n9  accommodations of public accommodations or otherwise discriminating against a person on the \n10  basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i); 28 C.F.R. § 36.202(a). \n11  100.

Defendant has failed to take any equitable steps to remedy Uber’s and \n7  drivers’ discriminatory conduct, and Defendant’s violations of the ADA are ongoing. \n8  Defendant’s unlawful actions also violate the ADA by deterring members of Plaintiffs NFB and \n9  NFB-CA, including Plaintiff Michael Hingson, and members of the proposed Class from \n10  attempting to access the Uber transportation services.

After over a year of \nlitigation and settlement negotiations, the parties agreed on a nationwide class \naction settlement under which Uber will take important steps to end discrimination \nagainst blind individuals who use guide dogs in its transportation network. \nUber provides convenient, on-demand rides to consumers throughout the United \nStates, dispatching cars to drive passengers where they need to go.

Uber Technologes, Inc., et al.-Disability Rights Advocates \nbasis-drivers have repeatedly refused to transport blind individuals who travel \nwith guide dogs. The transportation services industry is experiencing significant \ngrowth and change, and blind individuals who use guide dogs cannot be excluded \nfrom the benefits of the new transportation landscape. \nThanks to this lawsuit and the resulting settlement, blind individuals who use \nguide dogs will be able to use Uber services without the threat of discrimination. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Ub  er will take proactive steps to fight \ndiscrimination against blind individuals with guide dogs in its system. Uber will \nimprove driver education about service animal laws and will remove discriminatory \ndrivers from the Uber platform. Uber will track and respond to reports of \ndiscrimination more effectively. The NF  B and its affiliate will deploy blind riders \nwith guide dogs to test for compliance, and an independent monitor will review \nUber's compliance with the agreement. These improvements will enhance the \nreliability and usability of Uber's extensive transportation network for blind and \nvisually-disabled people across the country. \nDisability: Blind/Low Vision \nCase Area: Private Business, Transportation \nCase Files \nRead the NFB.Uber Settlement Agreement \nRead the NFB.Uber Settlement Addenda \nRead the NFB.Uber Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement \nRead the NFB.Uber Proposed Order Granting Preliminary Approval \nRead the Decision on Uber's Motion to Dismiss \nhttp://dralegal.orglcaselnaliooal-federation-of-th&-bl ind-of-cal ifa'ria-et-al-v-uber -technologies-inc-et-al/  2/6 \n\n51231'2016  Natiooal Federalioo of the Blind of Califa'nia, at al. v.

Uber provides efficient, \n6 convenient, and affordable transportation to consumers around the country, but passengers \n7 with guide dogs have faced denials of service and discrimination by drivers on the \n8 platform. The changes embodied in this Settlement will ensure that drivers in this \n9 important and growing sector of the transportation ecosystem will provide equal, non-\n10 discriminatory service to people traveling with service animals.  \n11 Plaintiffs the National Federation of the Blind (“NFB”), the National Federation of \n12 the Blind of California (“NFB-CA”), Michael Kelly, Michael Pedersen, and Michael \n13 Hingson, on behalf of themselves and a class of those similarly situated (collectively, \n14 “Plaintiffs”) and Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”) (collectively, “Parties”) \n15 came to this Settlement after protracted negotiations and exchange of information through \n16 the General Order 56 process.  \n17 The Settlement requires a comprehensive set of changes to Uber’s policies and \n18 practices. Uber will use multiple channels to inform drivers about their obligation to \n19 transport disabled individuals with service animals, will require drivers to affirm their \n20 understanding of this obligation and agree to comply, will implement a strict removal \n21 policy for drivers who discriminate, will improve complaint response and customer \n22 service, and will modify other policies that affect individuals with service animals, such as \n23 cleaning fees. Uber agrees to collect data related to alleged discrimination against service \n24 animal users, to provide the data to a third-party monitor, and to pay NFB to send blind \n25 users out as testers to ensure that discrimination on the Uber platform is decreasing. \n26 On July 13, 2016, this Court conditionally certified the proposed class and \n27 preliminarily approved the proposed Settlement. Dkt. No. 112. The Parties distributed \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n2 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 6 of 19\n \n1 notice to the class in accordance with the Court’s preliminary approval order. No persons \n2 have objected to the Settlement.  \n3 In light of these facts and as discussed below, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the \n4 Court find the Settlement to be fair, adequate, and reasonable, and grant final approval. \n5 Uber does not oppose this motion. \n6 STATEMENT OF FACTS \n7 A.  Procedural Background \n8 Plaintiffs brought this case against Uber seeking relief for alleged repeated denials \n9 of service in the Uber transportation network to blind passengers traveling with guide \n10 dogs. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \n11 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ \n12 51 & 52, and the California Disabled Persons Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 54-54.3.  \n13 The lawsuit was filed September 9, 2014 by NFB-CA, on behalf of its members, \n14 and Michael Hingson, who is blind and travels with a guide dog, and who alleges that he \n15 was deterred from using the Uber network because of the frequent discriminatory denials \n16 of service to which individuals like him are subject. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiffs amended their \n17 complaint in November 2014 to add two additional Plaintiffs, Michael Kelly and Michael \n18 Pedersen, both of whom alleged that they were denied service by transportation providers \n19 on the Uber platform because they were blind and traveling with service animals. Dkt. No. \n20 17. NFB, on behalf of its members participated in settlement negotiations and joined as an \n21 additional Plaintiff in April 2016. Dkt. Nos. 84, 113. NFB, along with its California \n22 affiliate NFB-CA, is an association of blind individuals that works to promote vocational, \n23 cultural, and social advancement and to achieve the integration of blind people into society \n24 on an equal basis with sighted people. Many NFB and NFB-CA members travel with \n25 service animals and have either used Uber transportation and were allegedly denied service \n26 or were deterred from using Uber transportation because of their knowledge of the alleged \n27 recurrent discrimination.  \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n3 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 7 of 19\n \n1 Uber is a company that connects passengers who seek transportation (“Riders”) to \n2 independent transportation providers (“Drivers”) via a smartphone application (“Uber \n3 Rider App”). Uber connects Riders and Drivers in many metropolitan areas around the \n4 United States, and provides an affordable and convenient way to procure transportation. \n5 Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief that would require Uber to take the steps \n6 necessary to ensure that Drivers do not refuse to transport blind individuals with service \n7 animals, in violation of the ADA and California state law. Dkt. No. 17, ¶ 123. Plaintiffs \n8 also sought damages for the alleged discrimination experienced by Mr. Hingson, Mr. \n9 Pedersen, and Mr. Kelly. Dkt. No. 17, ¶ 125. \n10 Uber moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint, arguing that Plaintiffs lacked standing \n11 and that Uber vehicles were not places of public accommodation under the ADA. Dkt. No. \n12 9. Plaintiffs amended their complaint, and Uber again moved to dismiss. Dkt. Nos. 17, 25. \n13 On April 17, 2015, the Court denied Uber’s motion to dismiss on all grounds. Dkt. No. 37. \n14 Plaintiffs undertook significant factual investigation and received information from \n15 the Defendant through the General Order 56 process. Following the motion to dismiss, the \n16 Parties exchanged initial disclosures on May 1, 2015, and Plaintiffs supplemented their \n17 disclosures on July 14, 2015. Declaration of Julia Marks in Support of Plaintiffs’ \n18 Unopposed Motion for Final Approval of Settlement (“Marks Decl.”) ¶ 6. The Parties met \n19 to review Uber’s App, website for Drivers, and system for bringing new Drivers onto the \n20 platform on May 8, 2015, and Uber provided additional information on its policies and \n21 practices during settlement negotiations. Marks Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8. Plaintiffs propounded \n22 discovery requests and noticed depositions, but postponed depositions because of the \n23 promising progress of settlement negotiations. Marks Decl. ¶ 9. Plaintiffs’ counsel \n24 collected stories and documents from more than 80 blind individuals, throughout the \n25 country, who reported denials of service by Drivers while traveling with their guide dogs. \n26 Marks Decl. ¶ 4. \n27 The Parties engaged in extensive thorough, informed, arm’s-length negotiations. \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n4 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 8 of 19\n \n1 The Parties held settlement discussions on May 8, 2015 and on June 18, 2015. Marks Decl. \n2 ¶ 7. On August 10, 2015, the Parties participated in mediation with Hon. Jamie Jacobs-\n3 May (ret.) at JAMS. Marks Decl. ¶ 8. Plaintiffs provided Defendant with a written \n4 settlement proposal based on progress at the mediation. The Parties exchanged redlines of \n5 the settlement agreement and engaged in additional discussion of settlement terms during \n6 the fall of 2015. Marks Decl. ¶ 10. \n7 The Parties came to an agreement on the key terms of the Settlement in January \n8 2016. Marks Decl. ¶ 12. The Parties agreed that the Settlement would be most effective as \n9 a class settlement, to ensure that the policy improvements would be consistent across \n10 Uber’s national markets and that individuals with service animals across the country would \n11 gain relief from the alleged discrimination. The Parties agreed upon and sought conditional \n12 certification for a settlement class (“Class”) of “all blind or visually disabled individuals \n13 nationwide who travel with the assistance of Service Animals and who have used, \n14 attempted to use, or been deterred from attempting to use transportation arranged through \n15 the Uber Rider App.” Settlement, attached to Marks Decl. as Exh. A, at § 1. \n16 The Parties filed their Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement \n17 and Related Motions on April 29, 2016. Dkt. No. 84. In response to concerns the Court \n18 raised regarding the scope of the release, the Parties modified the Settlement release \n19 language in Section 14.A to clarify the released entities, and agreed to modified notice \n20 requirements and deadlines. Dkt. No. 111. The parties also submitted supplemental \n21 briefing about the scope of released claims. Dkt. No. 101. The Court granted leave to file a \n22 second amended complaint to include class allegations, granted preliminary approval of \n23 the Settlement, and conditionally certified the Class on July 13, 2016. Dkt. No. 112. \n24 The Plaintiffs and the Class are represented by Disability Rights Advocates \n25 (“DRA”), Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld (“Rosen Bien”), and TRE Legal Practice (“TRE \n26 Legal”) (collectively, “Class Counsel”).  \n27\n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n5 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 9 of 19\n \n1 B.  The Settlement \n2 The Settlement will provide relief to Plaintiffs through implementation of the \n3 following terms.1 \n4 1.  Enhanced Dissemination of Information to Drivers \n5 Under the Settlement, Uber will require that all Drivers confirm that they \n6 understand their obligation to provide equal service to disabled Riders with service \n7 animals. Uber will require all Drivers to navigate through an interactive pop-up \n8 notification in the mobile application that Drivers use to receive ride requests (“Driver \n9 App”). The pop-up will provide information about service animals and the obligation to \n10 provide equal service. Drivers will have to accurately answer a series of questions \n11 regarding Uber’s service animal policies and affirm their willingness to transport Riders \n12 with service animals. If Drivers fail to complete these screens, Uber will block them from \n13 the Driver App, so that they cannot provide service on the platform. Settlement § 4.B. \n14 Uber will also send quarterly emails to Drivers reminding them of their obligation to \n15 transport Riders with service animals, and will update the Driver licensing agreement to \n16 explain the obligation. Id.  \n17 Uber will also add a statement confirming that new Drivers agree to transport \n18 passengers with service animals and a link to the Service Animal Policy to its online \n19 Driver sign-up process. Settlement § 4.A. \n20 2.  Changes to Enforcement Practices \n21 To enhance Drivers’ compliance with their legal and contractual obligations, Uber \n22 will improve its enforcement policies for violations of its service animal policy. Under the \n23 Settlement, Uber will block a Driver from the platform if the Driver knowingly refuses to \n24 transport a Rider because of a service animal. Uber will review every report of a ride \n                                              \n25\n1 A detailed summary of the Settlement is included in the Parties’ Joint Motion for \n26\nPreliminary Approval of Class Settlement and Related Motions. Dkt. No. 84, pp. 9-14. \n27\n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n6 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 10 of 19\n \n1 denial based on the presence of a service animal to determine whether the Driver involved \n2 violated the policy. Settlement § 5.A. If Uber determines that a Driver knowingly denied \n3 service to a Rider with a service animal because of that service animal, Uber will \n4 permanently block that Driver from the platform.  If Uber concludes that a Driver did not \n5 knowingly deny service to a Rider with a service animal because of that service animal, \n6 but Uber receives more than one complaint alleging denial because of a service animal, \n7 Uber will permanently block that Driver from the platform, without further inquiry. \n8 Settlement § 5.A.  \n9 3.  Complaint Processing and Response \n10 Uber will also make it easier for Riders to report denials of service and other service \n11 animal issues through the Uber Rider App and from the home page of the Uber website. \n12 Settlement § 5.B. Uber will respond to complaints about service animal discrimination in a \n13 timely manner and will provide customers with information about Uber’s investigation and \n14 whether the Driver involved in the incident was permanently blocked from the platform. \n15 Settlement § 5.B. Uber will also reverse any charges related to the incident, and will \n16 provide a Rider an account credit if a Driver is removed from the platform as a result of the \n17 Rider’s complaint. Settlement § 5.B. \n18 4.  Revisions to Uber’s Service Animal Policy \n19 Uber will revise its written service animal policy to reflect its enhanced \n20 enforcement policy, improved complaint processing and response policies and procedures, \n21 and updates to its cleaning fee policy. Settlement § 1. Uber will also adopt a guidance \n22 document to assist Uber employees in assessing allegations of discrimination. Settlement § \n23 5.A. \n24 5.  Compliance, Data Collection, and Testing \n25 Uber will collect data regarding service animal denials to facilitate monitoring, \n26 assessment of the policy, and practice improvements required by the Settlement. Uber \n27 agrees to maintain a national database with information about all alleged incidents of \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n7 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 11 of 19\n \n1 discrimination against Riders with service animals. This data includes Rider and Driver \n2 name and contact information, location, date, and account information for alleged denials \n3 of service, complaints, and numerical ratings. Settlement § 6.A. Class Counsel and a third-\n4 party monitor will review the data for the term of the Settlement, which is three and a half \n5 years with the possibility of extension. Settlement § 6.B. Additionally, NFB and NFB-CA \n6 will send blind individuals with service animals to use the Uber service to test whether \n7 Drivers are complying with their obligations to provide equal access. Settlement § 6.C. \n8 6.  Monitoring, Opportunity to Request Additional Policy Changes, and \nDispute Resolution \n9\nThe Settlement includes a number of provisions to ensure that Uber is making the \n10\nchanges required by the Settlement and that the updated policies and practices are \n11\neffectively reducing discrimination on the platform. First, a third-party monitor will review \n12\ndata and complaints and will report to Class Counsel on a yearly basis. If the monitor \n13\nconcludes that the policies and practices are not sufficiently ameliorating discrimination on \n14\nthe platform, the monitor can recommend additional changes. Settlement § 8.A. Further, \n15\nPlaintiffs may request additional changes if there is good cause to believe further \n16\nmodifications are necessary; such modifications cannot lessen the benefits or protections \n17\nfor members of the Class. Settlement § 8.B. The Settlement establishes a dispute resolution \n18\nprocedure in the event that the Parties disagree on the need for additional modifications or \n19\nother issues in implementing the Settlement. Settlement § 10. \n20\n7.  Monetary Payments \n21\nNFB and the individual names Plaintiffs will receive monetary compensation under \n22\nthe Settlement. NFB will receive a total of $225,000 over the term of the agreement. The \n23\npayments are intended to support the testing program. Settlement § 11. Mr. Hingson, Mr. \n24\nPedersen, and Mr. Kelly will receive $45,000 in total, to apportion among themselves, as \n25\ncompensation for the discrimination they experienced on the Uber platform.  \n26\nThe Parties did not settle the amount of attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses to \n27\nwhich Plaintiffs were entitled. Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Reasonable Attorneys’ Fees \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n8 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 12 of 19\n \n1 and Costs on September 19, 2016.

No Class Members Have Objected to the Settlement \n19 No class members have filed objections to the Settlement. Marks Decl. ¶ 32. The \n20 final day for class members to file objections was October 13, 2016. Dkt.

LEGAL STANDARD FOR SETTLEMENT OF A CLASS ACTION \n3 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the claims of a certified class \n4 may be settled only with a court’s approval. If a proposed settlement will bind class \n5 members, “the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, \n6 reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). When settlement takes place prior to \n7 formal class certification, the Court should engage in a more probing inquiry into the \n8 fairness of the settlement. Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1026 (9th Cir. 1998). \n9 A district court’s role in reviewing the substance of the settlement is solely to \n10 ensure that it is “fair, adequate, and free from collusion.” Lane v. Facebook, Inc., 696 F.3d \n11 811, 819 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Hanlon). The district court should consider the settlement \n12 as a whole, rather than looking at each separate part, to determine whether the settlement is \n13 fair. Id. at 818-19. Further, “the question whether a settlement is fundamentally fair within \n14 the meaning of Rule 23(e) is different from the question whether the settlement is perfect.” \n15 Id. Courts should give deference to the private consensual decision of the parties. Hanlon, \n16 150 F.3d at 1027. “[T]he court must also be mindful of the Ninth Circuit’s policy favoring \n17 settlement, particularly in class action law suits.” In re Omnivision Techs., Inc., 559 F. \n18 Supp. 2d 1036, 1041 (N.D. Cal. 2008). \n19 In assessing whether a proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, courts \n20 consider a collection of factors:  \n21 “the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; the risk, expense, complexity, and \nlikely duration of further litigation; the risk of maintaining class action \n22\nstatus throughout the trial; the amount offered in settlement; the extent of \ndiscovery completed and the stage of the proceedings; the experience and \n23\nviews of counsel; the presence of a governmental participant; and the \n24 reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.” Hanlon, 150 \nF.3d at 1026.  \n25\n26 Additionally, when the Settlement occurs prior to formal class certification, the \n27 Court must determine whether the settlement was a product of collusion or other conflicts \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n11 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 15 of 19\n \n1 of interest. In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 946-47 (9th Cir. \n2 2011). \n3 II.  FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT IS PROPER \n4 Plaintiffs assert, and the Defendant does not contest, that each of the Hanlon factors \n5 supports final approval of the proposed Settlement pursuant to Rule 23(e). \n6 A.  The Benefits to the Class are Significant in Light of the Strength of the \nPlaintiffs’ Case and the Risk, Expense, Complexity, and Likely Duration \n7 of Future Litigation. \n8 The first four Hanlon factors weigh in favor of a finding that the Settlement is fair, \n9 reasonable, and adequate. \n10 The Settlement provides significant benefits to the Class. As detailed above, the \n11 Settlement requires comprehensive, nationwide changes to Uber’s policies, practices, and \n12 procedures to ensure that blind persons traveling with service animals receive equal, non-\n13 discriminatory treatment on the Uber platform. Uber will clarify its service animal policy \n14 and make clear to Drivers that the company does not tolerate discrimination against guide \n15 dog users on its platform. The Settlement requires thorough dissemination of information \n16 to Drivers about the obligation to transport people traveling with service animals, and \n17 implements strict Driver contract termination policies that will deter drivers from denying \n18 rides to blind people with service animals. Under the Settlement, Class members will be \n19 able to report discrimination more easily and will receive timely and thorough responses \n20 upon submitting complaints. The Settlement includes additional protections that benefit the \n21 Class, including limitations on the imposition of cleaning fees and policies for reimbursing \n22 cancellation fees. The Settlement’s provisions regarding data reporting, testing, and \n23 monitoring will ensure that Uber implements these changes and that the changes \n24 sufficiently remedy discrimination in the Uber network. \n25 Although Plaintiffs maintain that they have a strong case, pursuing litigation instead \n26 of Settlement would carry significant risk, expense, and complexity. Had the Parties not \n27 achieved settlement, the Parties would likely have been engaged in protracted and \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n12 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 16 of 19\n \n1 contentious litigation. Discovery for the litigation would be lengthy and costly: Plaintiffs \n2 had already retained an expert and noticed numerous depositions, and discovery disputes \n3 were pending at the time of settlement. The Parties would also likely engage in complex \n4 law and motion practice. For instance, since Plaintiffs had originally filed this case as an \n5 action on behalf of individuals and an organization in California, to achieve the scope of \n6 relief that Plaintiffs negotiated in the Settlement, Plaintiffs would have needed to seek \n7 leave to file an amended complaint and to move for class certification of a nation-wide \n8 class. The Settlement avoids the risk and delay of protracted litigation, while providing \n9 significant benefit to the Class. \n10 B.  The Settlement is Fair, Adequate, and Reasonable in Light of the \nDiscovery Completed and the Stage of the Proceedings. \n11\nThe Parties had a strong grasp of the merits of their case before reaching agreement \n12\non the Settlement. When class counsel, as in this case, “possess a sufficient understanding \n13\nof the issues involved and the strengths and weaknesses of the case,” this factor weighs in \n14\nfavor of settlement approval. See Chun-Hoon v. McKee Foods Corp., 716 F. Supp. 2d 848, \n15\n852 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  \n16\nAlthough the Parties had not completed formal discovery or depositions, Class \n17\nCounsel conducted significant factual and legal research and the Parties exchanged \n18\ninformation prior to settlement through the General Order 56 process. “[I]n the context of \n19\nclass action settlements, formal discovery is not a necessary ticket to the bargaining table \n20\nwhere the parties have sufficient information to make an informed decision about \n21\nsettlement.” In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, 459 (9th Cir. 2000), as \n22\namended (June 19, 2000) (internal quotations omitted). Much of Plaintiffs’ case rested on \n23\naffirmative evidence of discriminatory treatment, which Class Counsel collected by \n24\nspeaking with over 80 individuals while investigating and litigating the case. Marks. Decl. \n25\n¶ 4. Class Counsel reviewed correspondence between Uber and individuals who alleged \n26\ndiscrimination, Uber’s publicly posted policies, and driver message boards. Marks. Decl. ¶ \n27\n4. During the General Order 56 process, Uber shared additional information about internal \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n13 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 17 of 19\n \n1 policies and practices that assisted Plaintiffs in determining proper relief to end the alleged \n2 discrimination. These investigations and exchanges provided the Parties with sufficient \n3 facts to make an informed decision about settlement. \n4   The Parties were further able to assess their relative positions prior to the Settlement \n5 because they commenced settlement negotiations after the Court had ruled on Defendant’s \n6 motion to dismiss.  \n7 C.  Experienced Class Counsel Endorse the Settlement. \n8 Class Counsel in this case brings extensive experience with class action litigation, \n9 settlement, and disability rights law. Disability Rights Advocates’ practice focuses \n10 exclusively on disability rights litigation, primarily consisting of class actions and \n11 representative impact actions, and includes litigation, negotiations, and creating and \n12 monitoring complex policy-based settlement agreements. Declaration of Laurence Paradis \n13 in Support of Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement and Related \n14 Motions (“Paradis Decl.”), Dkt. No. 85, ¶¶ 8, 9. Rosen Bien similarly brings significant \n15 experience with complex litigation and settlement implementation and monitoring. Paradis \n16 Decl. ¶¶ 11-13. TRE Legal specializes in disability rights litigation as well. Paradis Decl. ¶ \n17 14. Class Counsel brought this experience to bear on developing strategy, assessing the \n18 viability of Plaintiffs’ claims and pursuit of a class action, and negotiating and drafting the \n19 Settlement in this case.  \n20 The Ninth Circuit has recognized that parties that are represented by experienced \n21 and competent counsel “are better positioned than courts to produce a settlement that fairly \n22 reflects each party’s expected outcome in litigation.” In re Pac. Enters. Sec. Litig., 47 F.3d \n23 373, 378 (9th Cir. 1995). The significant experience of Class Counsel led to an effective \n24 and comprehensive Settlement, and Class Counsel are well positioned to assess the \n25 adequacy and efficacy of the Settlement. Class Counsel’s endorsement of the Settlement \n26 weighs in favor of a finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  \n27 Courts also consider whether government participants are involved in the \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n14 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 18 of 19\n \n1 Settlement. The United States, which had submitted a Statement of Interest to clarify the \n2 scope of Title III coverage during the motion to dismiss phase, Dkt. No. 29, did not object \n3 to the settlement. Dkt. No. 97.  \n4 D.  No Class Members Objected to the Settlement. \n5 “[T]he absence of a large number of objections to a proposed class action settlement \n6 raises a strong presumption that the terms of a proposed class settlement action are \n7 favorable to the class members.” In re Omnivision Techs., Inc., 559 F. Supp. 2d 1036, \n8 1043 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (quotation omitted). No class members submitted objections to the \n9 Settlement. Marks Decl. ¶ 32. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the settlements. \n10 E.  The Settlement Is the Product of Good Faith, Arms-Length \nNegotiations. \n11\nThe Parties engaged in protracted good faith, non-collusive, arms-length \n12\nnegotiations to reach settlement. The Parties began negotiations in May 2015 and \n13\ncontinued negotiations through the end of April 2016.  Marks Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 10, 12. The \n14\nParties held multiple in-person negotiations, and exchanged numerous redlines of the \n15\nSettlement and the Settlement addenda, which include Uber’s formal written policy on \n16\nservice animals, internal guidance documents, driver education materials, and detailed \n17\nplans for providing Riders with methods for reporting service animal issues. Marks Decl. \n18\n¶¶ 7, 8; Settlement Addenda 1-4. The Parties negotiated the policy, practice, and procedure \n19\nchanges that make up the class relief prior to negotiating damages for the individual named \n20\nPlaintiffs and prior to unsuccessfully negotiating attorneys’ fees and costs. Marks Decl. ¶ \n21\n11. \n22\nThe indicia of collusion are not present in this case. Signs of collusion include \n23\npayment of excessive attorneys’ fees when compared with the scope of relief and reversion \n24\nof fees to defendants. See In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d at 947. \n25\nSince the Settlement does not provide damages to the class, and class members do not \n26\nrelease their claims, there are no concerns about improper distribution or reversion of \n27\nfunds. Class Counsel has no guarantee of a significant fee recovery, as the Parties were \n28\n    3:14-cv-04086-NC\n15 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 128   Filed 10/27/16   Page 19 of 19\n \n1 unable to reacch agreemennt on attornneys’ fees.

The settlement provides a process for continued monitoring and \n22 \nenforcement of Uber’s policies. \n23 \nThe parties move for preliminary approval of their class action settlement, and \n24 \nplaintiffs seek to amend the complaint to include nationwide claims.  The Court finds that \n25 \nthe settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.

First \n5  Amended Complaint (“FAC”), Dkt. No. 17, at ¶ 2.  To use UberX services, an individual \n6  must either (1) create a user account, and provide Uber with the customer’s phone number, \n7  credit card information, and email address, or (2) travel as the guest of an individual with \n8  an Uber user account.  FAC ¶ 29.  The customer then submits a request through Uber’s \n9  mobile software application.  FAC ¶ 30.  Once Uber identifies the vehicle that will provide \n10  the customer with transportation, Uber notifies the customer via text message or through \n11  its smart phone application.  FAC ¶ 30.  The notification includes vehicle and driver \na  12  identification information and an estimated time of arrival.  FAC ¶ 30.  When the vehicle \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  has arrived, Uber notifies the customer, and the customer and passengers may board the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  vehicle.  FAC ¶ 30.  Uber provides several different transportation services in California, \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  and UberX is one of Uber’s most cost-effective transportation services.  FAC ¶ 29.

Procedural History \n24  In September 2014, Plaintiffs sued Uber alleging that it engages in discriminatory \n25  practices by permitting UberX drivers to deny access to blind individuals and their guide \n26  dogs.  Plaintiffs bring claims under (1) Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n27  (“ADA”); (2) California Unruh Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”); (3) California Disabled \n28  Persons Act (“DPA”); and (4) for declaratory relief.   \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 4 of 17\n \n1  In December 2014, Uber moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that individual \n2  plaintiffs and the NFBC did not have standing.  Dkt. No. 25.  In April 2015, the Court \n3  denied Uber’s motion to dismiss and allowed the case to proceed.  Dkt.

In January 2016, the parties reached an agreement on key elements of \n6  a settlement.  The parties continued to negotiate the specific language of certain provisions \n7  through early April 2016.   \n8  Plaintiffs now move to (1) amend the complaint to add plaintiff National Federation \n9  of the Blind (the national branch of the organization); (2) conditionally certify the class; \n10  (3) preliminary approve the class action settlement; (4) appoint class counsel and class \n11  representatives; and (5) direct notice to the class.

Overview of the Class Settlement \nN\n19  Broadly, the settlement provides for nationwide injunctive relief to riders with \n20  service animals by tightening and extending Uber’s accommodation policies.  In addition, \n21  the named plaintiffs, including NFB, will recover damages and attorneys’ fees, while the \n22  class members will retain the right to pursue their own damages claims.  The Court will \n23  retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement and NFB and Uber will work together to ensure \n24  the terms of the settlement are enforced for three-and-a-half years.  If the parties agree or \n25  the monitor determines that Uber did not substantially comply with the Agreement, the \n26  agreement’s term will extend by one-and-a-half years.  \n27  // \n28    \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      4 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 5 of 17\n \n1  1.  Class Definition \n2  NFB’s proposed amended complaint seeks to certify the following class: “All blind \n3  or visually disabled individuals nationwide who travel with the assistance of Service \n4  Animals and who have used, attempted to use, or been deterred from attempting to use \n5  transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App.”   \n6  While the number of class members is unknown, plaintiffs have identified seventy-\n7  four blind individuals who use service animals and belong to the class.  Approximately ten \n8  thousand blind individuals use guide dogs in the United States.  Over one hundred \n9  thousand Uber drivers provide transportation arranged through the Uber App in over 150 \n10  metropolitan areas nationwide.  Plaintiffs proffer that there are likely hundreds or \n11  thousands of class members.  \nrt nia  12  2.  Monetary Payment to the Plaintiffs \nur\noo 13  The settlement provides for monetary compensation to the named plaintiffs and the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  NBF National, but it does not provide for class-wide monetary relief.  Instead, the class \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  will not waive their right to pursue damages claims.  Plaintiffs Michael Pedersen, Michael \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Kelly, and Michael Hingson will each receive $15,000 to resolve their state law damages \nS \n n\ndr 17  claims.  Uber will also make three annual payments of $75,000 to NFB during the first \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  three years of the agreement’s terms.  If the term of the agreement is extended, Uber will \nN\n19  make a fourth payment of $75,000 to NFB at the beginning of the extended term.   \n20  3.  Injunctive Relief \n21  The injunctive relief provided for in the settlement is extensive.  In total, Uber will \n22  be required to implement a variety of policies to inform drivers that they must provide \n23  rides to individuals with service animals and to enforce the policies.  The injunctive relief \n24  falls into three main categories: (1) providing notice to drivers; (2) providing remedies for \n25  and systematic support to riders with service animals to report incidents; and (3) enforcing \n26  Uber’s policy that drivers may not discriminate against riders with service animals. \n27  // \n28   \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      5 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 6 of 17\n \n1  a.  Notice to Drivers \n2  Under the settlement agreement, Uber will require that new drivers expressly \n3  confirm that they have reviewed, understand, and agree to comply with their legal \n4  obligations as outlined in Uber’s Service Animal Policy.  In addition, drivers will be \n5  blocked from receiving trip requests from riders through the Uber platform until they \n6  confirm an interactive pop-up notification in the Uber driver app that they are willing to \n7  transport riders with service animals.  Drivers that are unwilling will be permanently \n8  blocked from receiving trip requests through Uber.  Uber will also send quarterly email \n9  reminders to all drivers of its policy requiring transportation of riders with service animals. \n10  b.  Support to Riders with Service Animals \n11  Uber will reverse the cancellation or other fees that were charged in connection \na  12  with an incident that is the basis of a service animal complaint.  Uber will not charge riders \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  with service animals cleaning fees for shedding by their service animals.  Uber will also \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  not charge cleaning fees to riders with service animals for the first two reported messes \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  involving the bodily fluid of the rider’s service animal.  Riders with service animals will be \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  able to contest cleaning fees.  Uber will make a good faith effort, within one week of \nS \n n\ndr 17  receiving the complaint, to inform the complainant of the outcome of Uber’s review of the \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  complaint, including whether Uber has terminated its contractual relationship with the \nN\n19  driver. \n20  c.  Enforcement \n21  Uber will adopt an enhanced enforcement policy, in which Uber will permanently \n22  terminate its contractual relationship with a driver and permanently terminate that driver’s \n23  ability to receive trip requests through the Uber platform if Uber determines that the driver \n24  knowingly refused to transport a rider because that rider was accompanied by a service \n25  animal.  Uber will also terminate its contractual relationship with a driver if it receives \n26  plausible complaints on more than one occasion asserting that a driver unlawfully refused \n27  to transport riders with service animals because of the service animal anywhere in the \n28  United States.  A complaining rider with a service animal will receive $25 credit if Uber \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      6 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 7 of 17\n \n1  terminates its relationship with the driver who is the subject of the complaint. \n2  Finally, the parties have agreed to a third-party monitor who will have access to \n3  Uber reports about complaints.  NFB will administer compliance testing.  Uber will \n4  compensate the monitor, with fees capped at $50,000 for 3.5 years, and an additional \n5  $35,000 if the parties agree to the year-and-a-half extension. \n6  4.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, and Administration Costs \n7  Uber will pay reasonable fees for the cost of settlement administration.  The parties \n8  request that KCC LLC be appointed as the settlement administrator.  Additionally, NFB \n9  will request reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, which Uber may oppose as to the \n10  amount.  NFB will annually request attorneys’ fees associated with overseeing the \n11  administration of the settlement. \nrt nia  12  5.  Release of Claims \nur\noo 13  The settlement agreement releases the following claims: \nCif\nt al\nicC 14   \nstrof  Effective on the Effective Date of this Agreement, Plaintiffs \ni \nDct 15  and  the  Settlement  Class,  and  each  of  their  executors, \nes tri successors,  heirs,  assigns,  administrators,  agents,  and \ntatDis 16  representatives, in consideration of the relief set forth herein, \nS  fully and finally release Uber Technologies, Inc., and all each \n n\neder 17  of its subsidiaries subsidiary and/or affiliate entities operating \nth\nnirt anywhere in the United States, (including but not limited to \nUo 18  Rasier, LLC and Rasier-CA, LLC) and each of their present, \nN\nformer  or  future  officers,  members,  directors,  shareholders, \n19  agents,  employees,  representatives,  consultants,  attorneys, \nparent  companies,  affiliates,  predecessors,  successors,  and \n20  assigns, to the fullest extent allowable by law, from any and all \nequitable relief claims, rights, demands, charges, complaints, \n21  actions,  suits,  and  causes  of  action,  currently  known  or \nunknown, foreseeable or unforeseeable, whether based upon \n22  Title III of the ADA, the Unruh Act or Disabled Persons Act, \nor based upon any other federal, state or local law, rule or \n23  regulation, order, or ordinance relating to or concerning equal \naccess for legally blind or visually disabled persons who travel \n24  with  Service  Animals,  which  were  alleged,  or  which  could \nhave  been  alleged,  in  the  Complaint  or  any  other  court  or \n25  administrative proceeding relating to the subject matter of the \nComplaint, that arose on or before the Effective Date. This is \n26  intended  to  include  claims  for  injunctive  relief,  declaratory \nrelief, and attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses relating to the \n27  current action. The named Plaintiffs also release all damage \nclaims that arose up through the Effective Date. This release \n28  excludes damage claims by the Settlement Class.  \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      7 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 8 of 17\n \n1  Notably, the class retains their damages claims, but releases their injunctive claims. \n2  6.  Class Notice \n3  Class notice will be administered primarily through KCC LLC, the settlement \n4  administrator.  KCC will maintain a website during the notice period with the agreed-to \n5  notice containing all relevant information.  Within sixty days of this order, KCC will \n6  publish the notice in the newsletters and magazines of the National Federation of the Blind \n7  and the American Council of the Blind, the largest associations of blind persons in the U.S.  \n8  Class counsel will distribute notice by email in a screen reader compatible format to \n9  persons who contacted class counsel to complain.  Class counsel will also post the notice \n10  on the websites of Disability Rights Advocates, Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld, LLP, and \n11  TRE Legal Practice.  The notice will also be electronically mailed to the membership \na  12  email list serves for the NFB, American Council of the Blind, National Association of \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  Guide Dog Users, and Guide Dog Users, Inc.  Uber will also post a link to the settlement \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  notice on its news blog.     \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  II.  DISCUSSION \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  The Court addresses (A) the amended complaint; (B) conditional class certification; \nS \n n\ndr 17  (C) preliminary approval of the settlement; (D) class notice; (E) the schedule. \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  A.  Amended Complaint \nN\n19  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to amend its pleading \n20  with the opposing party’s written consent.  Where the parties have agreed to file an \n21  amended complaint as part of the class settlement, judges in this district have granted leave \n22  to amend, subject to the terms of settlement.  See Miller v. Ghirardeli Chocolate Co., 12-\n23  cv-04936 LB, 2014 WL 4978433, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2014) (granting leave to amend \n24  for settlement purposes, but voiding the amendment if no final settlement occurs); Harris \n25  v. Vector Mktg. Corp., 08-cv-5198 EMC, 2011 WL 1627973, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, \n26  2011) (approving stipulation and granting leave to amend complaint as part of order \n27  granting preliminary approval); see also Ching v. Siemens Indus. Inc., 11-cv-4838 MEJ, \n28  2013 WL 6200190, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2013)(same). \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      8 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 9 of 17\n \n1  Here, the parties seek to amend the complaint to add National Federation of the \n2  Blind to the complaint as a plaintiff and to broaden the class allegations to include a \n3  nationwide class.   \n4  At the hearing, the Court expressed concern that broadening the scope of this case \n5  from a California class action to a nationwide might overlap with other ongoing cases.  \n6  Counsel for both parties indicated that they knew of no other case nationwide with the \n7  same set of claims, seeking the same relief.  However, plaintiffs’ counsel indicated that \n8  there is one other case filed for injunctive relief and damages, which would become moot \n9  as to the injunctive relief as a result of this settlement.  See Jolliff v. Uber Technologies, \n10  Inc., et. al., Case No. 16-cv-605 GBL, dkt. no. 1 at ¶¶ 84-85 (E.D. Va.). \n11  Thus, the Court finds that amendment of the complaint is appropriate and in the \na  12  interest of judicial efficiency to resolve nationwide claims in this litigation.  The Court \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  GRANTS the motion to amend the complaint.  Plaintiffs must file the second amended \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  complaint on the docket in a separate docket entry. \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  B.  Conditional Class Certification \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Class certification requires that: (1) the class be so numerous that joinder of all \nS \n n\ndr 17  members individually is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the class representative must be typical of the \nN\n19  claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the person representing the class must be able fairly \n20  and adequately to protect the interests of all members of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); \n21  Staton v. Boeing, 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2003).   \n22  In addition to meeting the conditions imposed by Rule 23(a), the parties seeking \n23  class certification must also show that the action is maintainable under Federal Rule of \n24  Civil Procedure 23(b).  Plaintiffs here are seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n25  Plaintiffs assert that the action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(2) which allows a class \n26  action to be certified when “members of a putative class seek uniform injunctive or \n27  declaratory relief from policies and practices that are generally applicable to the class as a \n28  whole.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 668 (9th Cir. 2014). \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      9 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 10 of 17\n \n1  1.  Numerosity \n2  Here, plaintiffs have identified at least seventy-four class members and estimate that \n3  hundreds or thousands more individuals could be class members.  The Court finds that the \n4  class is so numerous that joinder of all individuals members is impracticable.   \n5  2.  Commonality \n6  Here, there are questions of fact and law common to all class members, the answers \n7  to which will drive the resolution of the litigation.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 \n8  S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).  Although the facts of each individual’s alleged discrimination \n9  are different, the essential facts and questions of law are common.  Specifically, plaintiffs \n10  all seek to ensure that drivers using the Uber platform will reliably transport riders with \n11  service animals. \nrt nia  12  3.  Typicality \nur\noo 13  For purposes of the typicality inquiry, the named plaintiffs’ injuries need not be \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  identical with those of the other class members, “only that the unnamed class members \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  have injuries similar to those of the named plaintiffs and that the injuries result from the \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  same, injurious course of conduct.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 869 (9th Cir. \nS \n n\ndr 17  2001).   \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  Here, the Court acknowledges that the injuries of the organization, the individual \nN\n19  plaintiffs, and the putative class members are fairly distinct.  Each individual suffered a \n20  different type of offense, from deterrence to alleged abuse of a service animal.  However, \n21  in the context of this specific class action settlement, plaintiffs do not seek to resolve the \n22  damages claims on behalf of the class members.  Thus, the relevant injury is the denial of \n23  transportation or deterrence from transportation that plaintiffs seek to remedy through \n24  declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Court finds that for the injunctive relief sought, the \n25  typicality requirement is satisfied.  \n26  4.  Conflicts of Interest \n27  Proposed class representatives and their counsel cannot have conflicts of interest \n28  with the class and must vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of the class.  Hanlon, \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      10 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 11 of 17\n \n1  150 F.3d at 1020.  Here, class representatives and class counsel participated in contested \n2  motion to dismiss briefing and a hearing, began discovery, and mediated the dispute with a \n3  third-party neutral.  Additionally, plaintiffs and their counsel have litigated other equal \n4  access cases in the past for the purpose of seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on \n5  behalf of blind individuals.  There appears to be no conflict of interest with the class.    \n6  5.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n7  Rule 23(b)(2) provides that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act \n8  on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n9  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  “[T]he primary role of \n10  this provision has always been the certification of civil rights actions.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d \n11  at 686.  In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011), the Supreme Court \na  12  elaborated that Rule 23(b)(2) concerns the “individual nature of the injunctive or \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.”  “These \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  requirements are unquestionably satisfied when members of a putative class seek uniform \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  injunctive or declaratory relief from policies or practices that are generally applicable to \nS \n n\ndr 17  the class as a whole.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 687-88. \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  Here, the remedy of injunctive and declaratory relief sought is the same for all class \nN\n19  members and will remedy their alleged injuries.  Plaintiffs seek to change Uber’s policies \n20  to enforce consistency with the ADA and state law regulations requiring transportation \n21  providers to accommodate riders with service animals.  Thus, the relief sought is generally \n22  applicable to the class as a whole.  Additionally, the parties’ settlement reflects policy \n23  changes that will allow all class members to benefit from the improved reliability of \n24  transportation provided by drivers and the Uber platform.  \n25  C.  Preliminary Approval of the Settlement \n26  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires judicial approval of any settlement \n27  by a certified class.  Although there is a “strong judicial policy that favors settlements, \n28  particularly where complex class action litigation is concerned,” Linney v. Cellular Alaska \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      11 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 12 of 17\n \n1  P’ship, 151 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir. 1998), “[t]he purpose of Rule 23(e) is to protect the \n2  unnamed members of the class from unjust or unfair settlements affecting their rights.”  In \n3  re Syncor ERISA Litig., 516 F.3d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir. 2008).  Accordingly, a settlement \n4  should only be approved if it is “fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable.”  Torrisi v. \n5  Tucson Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d 1370, 1375 (9th Cir. 1993).  In determining whether the \n6  proposed settlement meets this standard, the Court does not have the ability “to delete, \n7  modify, or substitute certain provisions. . . . The settlement must stand or fall in its \n8  entirety.”  Id.  Due to the dangers of collusion between class counsel and the defendant, as \n9  well as the need for additional protections when the settlement is not negotiated by a \n10  Court-designated class representative, settlement approval that takes place prior to formal \n11  class certification requires a higher standard of fairness.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1026. \na  12  “The Court may grant preliminary approval of a settlement and direct notice to the \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  class if the settlement: (1) appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  negotiations; (2) has no obvious deficiencies; (3) does not improperly grant preferential \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  treatment to class representatives or segments of the class; and (4) falls within the range of \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  possible approval.”  Harris v. Vector Mktg. Corp., No. 08-cv-05198 EMC, 2011 WL \nS \n n\ndr 17  1627973, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2011); In re Tableware Antitrust Litig., 484 F. Supp. 2d \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  1078, 1079 (N.D. Cal. 2007).   \nN\n19  1.  The Settlement Process \n20  Here, the settlement appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive \n21  negotiations.  The parties had an all-day mediation before Hon. Jamie Jacobs-May (ret.) at \n22  JAMS in August 2015, after briefing and arguing a contentious motion to dismiss.  \n23  Although the named plaintiffs will receive monetary compensation, the class does not \n24  waive its damages claims.  Additionally, the parties have not agreed to the amount of \n25  attorneys’ fees and costs counsel can recover.  Instead, plaintiffs will move for attorneys’ \n26  fees and costs, and defendants may oppose the amount requested.  Ultimately, the Court \n27  will determine the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees.  As a result, the Court finds that \n28  the concerns of collusion are not warranted in this case.   \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      12 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 13 of 17\n \n1  2.  The Presence of Obvious Deficiencies \n2  The Court expressed concern over two aspects of the settlement.  First, the Court \n3  asked defendants to clarify the identities of all entities released under the settlement \n4  agreement.  Defendants amended the release, dkt. no. 107, and clarified that “the only \n5  Released Parties with whom Settlement Class Members may have a contractual \n6  relationship are Uber Technologies, Inc. and a single subsidiary, Uber USA, LLC.  From \n7  Defendants’ perspective, it is unnecessary to identify any subsidiary entity specifically, as \n8  Uber Technologies, Inc. directly or indirectly wholly-owns all subsidiaries operating in the \n9  United States.”   \n10  Second, the Court was concerned that class members will waive their rights under \n11  the ADA and all state and local laws.  The Court requested that plaintiffs submit additional \na  12  briefing to confirm whether any state disability laws provide greater protection then the \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  ADA and California law.  Plaintiffs confirmed for the Court that no state laws contain \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  stricter requirements for access to transportation services than those outlined in the ADA \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  and the Unruh Act (California law).   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  With these amendments and proffers, the Court is satisfied that there are no obvious \nS \n n\ndr 17  deficiencies in the settlement. \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  3.  Preferential Treatment \nN\n19  Incentive awards for class representatives, should the Court finally approve them, \n20  does not render the settlement unfair, as “the Ninth Circuit has recognized that service \n21  awards to named plaintiffs in a class action are permissible and do not render a settlement \n22  unfair or unreasonable.”  Harris, 2011 WL 1627973, at *9 (citing Staton, 327 F.3d at 977).  \n23  Here, each named plaintiff will receive $15,000 and release their damages claims, while \n24  NFB will receive $45,000.  Class members will not receive any monetary benefits from the \n25  settlement, but will also not waive their right to pursue damages claims.  The Court agrees \n26  with plaintiffs that this “preferential treatment” is properly categorized as a settlement of \n27  the named plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety.  Since plaintiffs’ monetary recovery does not \n28  harm or take away value from the class claims as a whole, the Court finds that such \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      13 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 14 of 17\n \n1  preferential treatment is permissible.  \n2  4.  Whether the Settlement Falls Within the Range of Possible Approval \n3  Finally, the Court must determine whether the proposed settlement falls within the \n4  range of possible approval.  “To evaluate the range of possible approval criterion, which \n5  focuses on substantive fairness and adequacy, courts primarily consider plaintiff’s \n6  expected recovery balanced against the value of the settlement offer.”  Harris, 2011 WL \n7  1627973, at *9 (quoting Vasquez v. Coast Valley Roofing, Inc., 670 F. Supp. 2d 1114, \n8  1125 (E.D. Cal. 2009)).   \n9  To determine whether an agreement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and \n10  reasonable, the Court may preview the factors that ultimately inform final approval: “[1] \n11  the strength of plaintiff’s case; [2] the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of \na  12  further litigation; [3] the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the trial; [4] the \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  amount offered in settlement; [5] the extent of discovery completed, and the stage of the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  proceedings; [6] the experience and views of counsel; [7] the presence of a governmental \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  participant; and [8] the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.”  Id. at *9 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  (citing Churchill Village v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004)).  \nS \n n\ndr 17  Here, the Court finds that the agreement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  reasonable because plaintiffs received nearly all the injunctive relief they sought.  The \nN\n19  Court notes that plaintiffs faced several additional hurdles to demonstrating a successful \n20  case, including navigating Uber’s arbitration clause argument, maintaining standing, and \n21  obtaining class certification.   \n22  This is a complex case, which touches on cutting-edge questions at the intersection \n23  of the sharing economy, equal access, and constitutional law.  The Court observes that if \n24  this case had proceeded, both parties would assume significant risks with voluminous \n25  discovery, burdensome motion practice, and novel legal issues.  \n26  /// \n27     \n28 \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      14 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 112   Filed 07/13/16   Page 15 of 17\n \n1  D.

CONCLUSION \n7  In the Court’s experience, a case involving injunctive relief that seeks a \n8  comprehensive change to a company’s policies is often better resolved through the \n9  collaborative process of settlement, rather than the adversarial process of litigation.  As \n10  plaintiffs note, the Uber app platform is a highly accessible and useful tool for riders with \n11  service animals, perhaps even more so than traditional transportation methods.  By \na  12  engaging in good faith negotiations, the parties have achieved an omnibus plan to \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  eliminate discrimination in this accessible transportation platform for blind riders with \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  service animals.  \nstrof \ni \nDct 15  Thus, in conclusion, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion and directs as follows: \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  1.  Plaintiffs’ request to amend the complaint is GRANTED.  The second \nS \n n\ndr 17  amended complaint must be filed on the docket within 7 days; \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  2.

The settlement is preliminarily approved; \n27  6.  KCC LLC is appointed as the settlement administrator; \n28  7.

This action seeks to put an end to systemic civil rights violations committed by \n3  Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Defendant”) in California against blind individuals who use guide \n4  dogs. Plaintiff National Federation of the Blind (“NFB”) of California sues on behalf of its \n5  members, including Plaintiff Hingson, who have been and continue to be deterred from using \n6  Uber’s UberX taxi service because Uber has failed to ensure that blind riders with service \n7  animals, including members of Plaintiff NFB of California, can access Uber’s taxi services. \n8  2.  Uber offers the UberX taxi service to sighted individuals in California. UberX is \n9  highly cost-effective and widely available. Uber uses mobile software applications to arrange \n10  rides between passengers and its fleet of UberX drivers in much the same way that a taxi \n11  dispatch arranges rides for customers. \n12  3.  UberX drivers are refusing to transport many blind individuals who use service \nATES  LOOR1204  13   an im als, including members of NFB of California. For example, UberX drivers refused to \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  transp ort Jamey Gump, Jonathan Lyens, and Juanita Herrera, blind members of NFB of \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     Clik  aeli  wfoi rsne i rae,  fbuescinagu steo  tthraenys upsoer tg buliidned d iongdsiv. iFduuratlhse, ri,n UclbuedriXng d irdiveenrtsif iaecdr oUssb ethrXe  Udrniivteedrs S wtahtoe s are \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   rcea pnecaetleladtliyo nd efneeiesd,  arnidde sa btoan odnoen bedli nbdli nwdo tmraavne olenr st wine levxet rseempaer wateea othcecra,s aiolln bs,e cchauarsgee odf  bgluinidde r didoegrss.  \n \n19  In total, Plaintiffs are aware of more than thirty instances where drivers of UberX vehicles \n20  refused to transport blind individuals with service animals. UberX drivers that refused to \n21  transport these blind individuals did so after they initially agreed to transport the riders. The \n22  UberX drivers denied the requested transportation service after the drivers had arrived and \n23  discovered that the riders used service animals.  \n24  4.  In addition, some UberX drivers seriously mishandle guide dogs or harass blind \n25  customers with guide dogs even when they do not outright deny the provision of taxi service. For \n26  example, Leena Dawes is blind and uses a guide dog. An UberX driver forced Ms. Dawes’ guide \n27  dog into the closed trunk of the UberX sedan before transporting Ms. Dawes. When Ms. Dawes \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Other blind customers \n3  with guide dogs have been yelled at by Uber drivers who are hostile toward their guide dogs. \n4  5.  Many of these blind individuals submitted written complaints to Uber concerning \n5  the discriminatory treatment that they had experienced. However, Uber has failed to notify most \n6  of these individuals whether Uber has thoroughly investigated their complaints, disciplined the \n7  relevant UberX drivers, or taken any other meaningful steps to ensure that these drivers do not \n8  continue to unlawfully discriminate against them or other individuals with service animals. \n9  Instead, Uber representatives often respond to these complaints by denying responsibility for the \n10  discrimination. Meanwhile, many of these blind individuals experience ongoing denials from \n11  multiple drivers. \n12  6.  Plaintiff Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of \nATES  LOOR1204  13   C al ifornia. Mr. Hingson, a public speaker and best-selling author, travels extensively throughout \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  Califo rnia and has traveled with a guide dog for decades.

When Uber denies rides to blind riders with service animals, blind individuals \n21  experience several harms. They face unexpected delays, they must arrange alternate \n22  transportation that is sometimes more costly, and they face the degrading experience of being \n23  denied a basic service that is available to all other paying customers.  \n24  8.  In addition, Uber charges many blind riders with guide dogs cancellation fees \n25  after UberX drivers have unlawfully denied them service. These blind riders are also often \n26  placed in the uncomfortable position of explaining to uninformed UberX drivers that service \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Uber is violating basic equal access requirements under both the ADA and state \n4  law by failing to implement policies and procedures that would prevent or reduce discrimination \n5  against blind riders committed by UberX drivers. Because Uber closely monitors and tightly \n6  controls interactions between UberX drivers and its customers, Uber can implement policies and \n7  procedures, including policies and procedures that leverage its mobile smart phone software \n8  applications, that would prevent or reduce discrimination committed by its drivers against blind \n9  riders with service dogs. However, Uber insists that it is not a transportation provider and that it \n10  is not legally obligated to take any steps to ensure that its drivers do not discriminate against \n11  blind riders. Uber maintains this position despite the fact that the California Public Utilities \n12  Commission ruled that Uber is a transportation provider operating the UberX taxi service. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      10.  UberX and other similar taxi services are a critical transportation option for many \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  blind  individuals in California.

Due to the public’s widespread adoption of smart phones, Uber and other \n22  transportation network companies are quickly supplanting traditional taxi companies and \n23  becoming the public’s primary option for on-demand taxi services. Uber offers taxi services in \n24  most of California’s largest cities and is quickly spreading.  \n25  12.  Congress provided a clear and national mandate for the elimination of \n26  discrimination against individuals with disabilities when it enacted the Americans with \n27  Disabilities Act. Such discrimination includes discrimination in the provision of taxi services. \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Plaintiffs NFB of California and Hingson proposed to Uber that the parties avoid \n4  litigation and instead attempt to resolve this matter through structured negotiations, but \n5  Defendant refused. Plaintiffs were ultimately unable to obtain a commitment by Defendant to \n6  remedy these barriers to full and equal access. \n7  JURISDICTION \n8  14.

The NFB of California is a duly organized nonprofit association of blind \n2  Californians. It is the California State affiliate of the National Federation of the Blind. The NFB \n3  of California’s mission is to promote the vocational, cultural, and social advancement of the \n4  blind; to achieve the integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality with the sighted; \n5  and to take any other action which will improve the overall condition and standard of living of \n6  the blind. Reliable access to modern, publicly available transportation services such as UberX is \n7  critical to the NFB of California and its members. Securing access to the UberX taxi service \n8  advances the NFB of California’s goal to promote integration of the blind into society on a basis \n9  of equality by enabling blind individuals to travel in the same way that many sighted individuals \n10  travel. UberX drivers have refused to transport members of the NFB of California because they \n11  have service animals. The NFB of California sues on behalf of its members who have been \n12  deterred from using the UberX service due to unlawful discrimination against blind individuals \nATES  LOOR1204  13   w ith  service animals.

Plaintiff Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB of California, \n21  and currently resides in Victorville, California. Mr. Hingson is a public speaker and a best-\n22  selling author who has traveled with a guide dog for decades. Mr. Hingson regularly travels and \n23  regularly uses taxis within California for work and leisure. Mr. Hingson often travels to Los \n24  Angeles and Sacramento in connection with his advocacy work for the National Federation of \n25  the Blind of California. He also regularly travels to San Francisco for personal and professional \n26  business. Though Mr. Hingson would like to use the UberX transportation service, he is deterred \n27  from signing up for and attempting to use Uber’s transportation services because of the \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Mr. Hingson owns and regularly uses an iPhone capable of running the Uber \n3  iPhone application, and Mr. Hingson has a credit card that he could use to pay for the UberX taxi \n4  service. The term “Plaintiffs” used in this complaint means both NFB of California, on behalf of \n5  itself and its members with service animals who are deterred from using the UberX taxi service \n6  because of discrimination against blind persons with service animals, and Mr. Hingson unless \n7  otherwise indicated. \n8  22.  Defendant Uber, a for-profit transportation network company based in California, \n9  provides transportation services through thousands of vehicles in California. Uber uses smart \n10  phone software applications to arrange rides between passengers and its fleet of drivers in much \n11  the same way that a taxi dispatch arranges rides for customers.

Uber provides seveFrAalC dTifUfeAreLn tA taLxLi EseGrvAicTeIsO toN mS embers of the general public in a \n \n19  rapidly expanding number of metropolitan areas across California and the United States. Uber’s \n20  taxi services vary based on the type of vehicle providing the transportation. UberX is one of \n21  Uber’s most cost-effective taxi services. To use Uber taxi services, a customer must create a user \n22  account, and the customer must provide Uber with her phone number, credit card information, \n23  and email address. Uber has developed mobile software applications for iPhones, Android \n24  phones, and Windows phones that customers use to request transportation from Uber. \n25  24.  To use the UberX taxi service, a customer submits a request through one of \n26  Uber’s mobile software applications. Once Uber identifies the vehicle that will provide the \n27  customer with taxi service, Uber notifies the customer either by text message or through its smart \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

The notification includes the UberX driver’s name, customer rating, phone \n2  number, vehicle license plate number, make and model of the UberX vehicle, and the driver’s \n3  estimated time of arrival. Uber’s mobile application allows customers to track the UberX \n4  vehicle’s location as the driver navigates to the customer. The customer may also submit his or \n5  her trip destination through Uber’s mobile application. \n6  25.  Uber notifies the customer once his or her UberX vehicle has arrived. The \n7  customer may then board the vehicle. If the customer submitted his or her destination address to \n8  Uber, then Uber will supply the UberX driver with turn-by-turn directions to the customer’s \n9  destination. If the customer did not enter the destination into Uber’s application, the customer \n10  must provide the driver with his or her destination. The driver then starts the fare meter in the \n11  Uber software application and proceeds to the customer’s destination. When the customer arrives \n12  at his or her destination, the driver ends the trip in the Uber smart phone application. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      26.

Uber also controls who may use the UberX taxi service. Uber makes the UberX \n21  service available only to members of the public who have a credit card and a smart phone that \n22  can run one of its mobile applications, who create an Uber account, and who request a ride \n23  through Uber’s mobile application. Customers cannot access the UberX taxi service by \n24  physically hailing an UberX vehicle on the street. \n25  28.  Uber exercises significant control over the UberX taxi service, and Uber has \n26  detailed requirements for driver conduct and appearance. Uber has requirements for the type and \n27  age of the vehicle that drivers may use to provide the UberX taxi service. In addition, before an \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Uber also requires that UberX drivers refrain from smoking while providing \n3  Uber taxi services, refrain from asking customers to give them five-star ratings, and meet or \n4  exceed the estimated time-of-arrival that Uber generates and provides to each customer. In \n5  addition, Uber instructs UberX drivers that the share of trip requests that they accept through \n6  Uber’s application should be consistently high, and that UberX drivers may not accept street \n7  hails from potential passengers. Furthermore, Uber issues training and directives concerning \n8  other requirements to UberX drivers. \n9  29.  Uber also closely monitors its UberX drivers. Uber records many details about the \n10  taxi services that its UberX drivers provide, including for each trip: (1) the pickup location, (2) \n11  the time of pickup, (3) the drop off location, (4) the time of drop off, (5) the distance traveled, (6) \n12  the trip route, (7) the trip duration, and (8) the customer’s identity. Uber employees who \nATES  LOOR1204  13   su p ervise drivers have easy access to this data. In addition, Uber periodically reviews the driving \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  record  for each of its UberX drivers.

Uber provides UberX drivers with iPhones loaded with Uber’s smart-phone \n20  application. When providing Uber’s taxi services, drivers use these phones to receive and \n21  respond to trip requests, receive GPS-based navigational guidance, record the beginning and end \n22  of each trip, communicate with customers, and cancel trips. In addition, Uber maintains general \n23  commercial liability insurance to cover claims concerning incidents that occur while drivers are \n24  providing UberX taxi services. \n25  31.  Uber tightly controls payment for its UberX taxi services. Customers do not pay \n26  drivers of Uber vehicles directly. Instead, Uber automatically charges a customer’s credit card \n27  after he or she arrives at her destination. Uber has exclusive control over the fares that customers \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Fares for Uber’s taxi services are based on \n2  the duration and distance of each trip and other factors such as demand at the time and place of \n3  the ride. Uber keeps twenty percent of each fare. Thus, Uber compensates its UberX drivers \n4  based on the duration and distance of the trips that they provide to customers. Customers who \n5  dispute the fare for a particular trip must contact Uber customer service representatives to request \n6  an adjustment to their fares. \n7  32.  Thus, Uber closely monitors and controls interactions between UberX drivers and \n8  customers. Uber decides which of its UberX drivers may transport each customer. In addition, \n9  Uber specifies how quickly each UberX driver should pick up each customer. After UberX \n10  drivers pick up customers, Uber routinely provides UberX drivers with directions to customers’ \n11  destinations, and Uber specifies driver conduct that is prohibited while UberX drivers transport \n12  customers. Moreover, Uber decides how much each customer must compensate each UberX \nATES  LOOR1204  13   dr iv er for each trip, and Uber, not the UberX driver, provides each customer with a fare receipt \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  for ea ch trip.

On September 19, 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission ruled that \n20  Uber is a transportation provider with respect to the UberX service. The Commission requires \n21  that Uber possess a Class P Charter Party Carrier permit issued by the Commission to operate the \n22  UberX service in California. The Commission concluded that Uber is a transportation provider \n23  because Uber provides essentially the same function as a taxi dispatch office and because Uber \n24  controls payment for its transportation services. The Commission also explained that the fact that \n25  a smart phone application is used to arrange Uber’s transportation service is irrelevant to whether \n26  Uber is a transportation provider. The Commission also stated that Uber may not discriminate \n27  against people with disabilities in the provision of its UberX transportation service. \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Members of Plaintiff NFB of California and other blind individuals use Uber’s \n2  UberX taxi service. Many of these individuals operate Uber’s smart phone software application \n3  using text-to-speech technology that is built into iPhones. Text-to-speech software, commonly \n4  used by persons who are blind or visually impaired, enables blind persons to operate smart \n5  phones by translating visual information and text displayed on a touchscreen device into audible \n6  synthesized speech or into Braille on a portable electronic braille display.  \n7  35.  UberX drivers have refused on the basis of disability to transport many blind \n8  individuals with service animals, including members of Plaintiff NFB of California. For \n9  example, Jamey Gump is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of California. On or \n10  about March 23, 2014, an UberX driver refused to transport Mr. Gump in San Leandro, \n11  California from a work-related event to his home. On that occasion, Mr. Gump used the Uber \n12  mobile app to summon an UberX taxi. The UberX driver pulled the vehicle up to where Mr. \nATES  LOOR1204  13   G um p was standing on the curb and, after noticing that Mr. Gump had a dog, said “no pets \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  allowe d.” Mr. Gump tried to explain that his guide dog was a service animal and that the UberX \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     sdhr  iovw  er  t hh aed U  ab leergXa ld oribvleigr aatnio onf ftioc iaalll ogwui tdhee d soegrv iidceen atinfiimcaatli oinn tcoa trhde i svseuheidcl eb.y M hirs.

On or about May 21, 2014, another UberX driver refused to transport Mr. Gump \n20  because of his service animal. On that occasion, Mr. Gump and a friend who also uses a service \n21  animal were enjoying an evening at the Dutch Goose, a local pub in downtown Menlo Park, \n22  California. Mr. Gump had planned to leave on a trip early the next morning and requested an \n23  UberX ride to get to his home in Menlo Park because of the late hour. After the requested UberX \n24  vehicle had pulled up to the curb, Mr. Gump and his friend opened a passenger door. The UberX \n25  driver began shouting “no dogs!” Mr. Gump tried to explain that his dog was a service animal for \n26  his disability and was legally allowed in the vehicle. The UberX driver began shouting and \n27  cursing at Mr. Gump and his friend in a language that Mr. Gump did not understand. Mr. \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

As Mr. Gump \n2  attempted to enter the vehicle, the UberX driver quickly accelerated the vehicle forward, nearly \n3  injuring Mr. Gump’s guide dog and causing an open passenger door to strike Mr. Gump’s friend. \n4  The UberX driver then sped away and cancelled the ride request. Mr. Gump and his friend \n5  immediately called the police to file a report and used alternative transportation to travel home \n6  approximately forty-five minutes later.  \n7  37.  On August 20, 2014, Mr. Gump requested an UberX ride to pick him up at 214 \n8  Van Ness Ave., San Francisco, California. Mr. Gump determined from the map in the Uber \n9  iPhone application that his requested vehicle was about to turn onto his street. Mr. Gump then \n10  went out to the curb with his guide dog in direct sight of the oncoming vehicle to intercept the \n11  UberX driver. Mr. Gump noticed a vehicle slow its speed to a near stop in front of him and then \n12  accelerate again as it passed him on the curb. A few seconds later, Mr. Gump received a \nATES  LOOR1204  13   no ti fication on his phone that the UberX driver had cancelled the ride.

Mr. \n22  Gump hopes that Uber will change its policies and practices to better prevent discrimination \n23  against passengers with service animals so that he can enjoy Uber with the same convenience \n24  and reliability enjoyed by others.  \n25  39.  Jonathan Lyens is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of California. \n26  An UberX driver refused to transport him from his home to a job interview in San Francisco, \n27  California on or about February 20, 2014.

Uber notified Mr. Lyens that it \n2  had identified an UberX vehicle to transport him, and Uber notified Mr. Lyens when the vehicle \n3  arrived at his home. Mr. Lyens then went with his guide dog to the street in front of his home to \n4  find his UberX vehicle. Mr. Lyens observed that a vehicle arrived at his home briefly after Uber \n5  notified him that his transportation had arrived. Uber then notified Mr. Lyens that the driver of \n6  the Uber vehicle had cancelled his ride, and Mr. Lyens observed the vehicle in front of his home \n7  leave. As a result of this cancellation, Mr. Lyens had to pay a higher fare for transportation to his \n8  interview. He was also late to his interview because of the delay.  \n9  40.  Juanita Herrera is a blind college student, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB \n10  of California, and resides in Southern California. Ms. Herrera is interested in using the UberX \n11  service because it is more convenient and affordable than other taxi options. She attempted to use \n12  the UberX service for the first time on August 7, 2014. She requested a ride from the Macy’s \nATES  LOOR1204  13   st or e located at 6200 Slauson Avenue in Culver City, California.

However, Uber has failed to \n4  inform Mr. Schulenburg whether Uber disciplined the relevant drivers or took any other steps to \n5  ensure that these drivers would not unlawfully discriminate against other individuals with service \n6  animals. Instead, Uber responded to some of Mr. Schulenburg’s complaints by stating that Uber \n7  cannot control its drivers’ conduct because the drivers are independent contractors and by \n8  advising Mr. Schulenburg that he should inform UberX drivers of their legal obligation to allow \n9  his service animal to accompany him. \n10  42.  Sarah Outwater is blind and uses a guide dog. UberX drivers refused to transport \n11  her in Boston on at least twelve separate occasions over the last year.

Plaintiffs are aware of other blind persons throughout California and the United \n5  States whom UberX drivers refused to transport because those individuals had service animals. \n6  46.  In addition, some UberX drivers mishandle transportation services for blind \n7  people using guide dogs even when they do not outright deny service. For example, Leena \n8  Dawes is blind and uses a guide dog. On or about March 27, 2014, an UberX driver placed Ms. \n9  Dawes’ guide dog in the closed trunk of his sedan before transporting Ms. Dawes in Sacramento, \n10  California. Once Ms. Dawes had realized that her dog was in the trunk, she pleaded with the \n11  driver to pull over so that she could retrieve her dog, but the driver refused her request.

At that time, Mr. Hingson was aware that Uber was available in San Francisco. \n5  However, because of a tight schedule, Mr. Hingson decided not to attempt to use the UberX taxi \n6  service because he could not afford to be delayed by an UberX driver refusing to take his guide \n7  dog. Instead, Mr. Hingson arranged for a taxicab well in advance of his transit and extended his \n8  trip so that he could use nondiscriminatory transportation services to travel to his appointment on \n9  time.  \n10  49.  Plaintiff Hingson was further deterred from using Uber on January 20, 2014. On \n11  that occasion, Mr. Hingson needed to quickly travel from the Ferry Building in San Francisco to \n12  a speaking engagement at Wells Fargo. Mr. Hingson could not risk arriving late for this \nATES  LOOR1204  13   im p ortant professional engagement. Mr. Hingson wanted to use UberX because of its general \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  conve nience and the quality of the vehicles.

However, Mr. Hingson wanted to be \n20  focused for this meeting and believed the stress of encountering an improperly trained UberX \n21  driver that refused to transport his service animal would cause him stress and negatively affect \n22  his performance at the meeting.  \n23  51.  Plaintiff Hingson would like to use UberX for future travel. For example, on or \n24  about September 28, 2014, Mr. Hingson will travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco to attend \n25  meetings with marketing consultants for the purpose of filming video footage.

However, UberX is currently not a reliable \n2  source of transportation for Mr. Hingson because of the risk that an UberX driver will refuse to \n3  transport his service animal. Mr. Hingson hopes that Uber will take responsibility for the conduct \n4  of its drivers and assert the control that it has over them to prevent and minimize discrimination. \n5  Mr. Hingson would use UberX if Uber properly trained drivers, adopted and enforced effective \n6  antidiscrimination policies, and provided blind passengers a convenient way to immediately \n7  report discrimination so that he has some assurance that UberX will be as reliable and convenient \n8  for him and his guide dog as Uber is for others.  \n9  52.  Uber is violating basic equal access requirements under both the ADA and state \n10  law by failing to implement policies and procedures that would prevent or reduce discrimination \n11  against blind riders committed by UberX drivers.

Nos. 204, 205 \n sir\netattsiD 16       \nS \n n\ndr 17  Before the Court are Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to seal and motion to modify \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  the parties’ settlement agreement.  See Dkt. Nos. 204, 205.  Plaintiffs request that the Court \nN\n19  extend its jurisdiction over the parties’ agreement and impose additional policies and \n20  practices on Uber to curb its alleged discrimination against the visually impaired.  Because \n21  the parties’ agreement does not allow the modification Plaintiffs seek, the Court DENIES \n22  Plaintiffs’ motion. \n23  I.  Background \n24  In April 2016, plaintiffs National Federation of the Blind, its California affiliate, \n25  and various individuals settled this lawsuit with defendant Uber Technologies.  See Dkt. \n26  Nos. 84, 85-1 (“Settlement”).  The Settlement required Uber to adopt various policies and \n27  practices designed to reduce or eliminate discrimination against visually impaired \n28  customers who required the use of service animals.  Id. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 213   Filed 07/15/20   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  As relevant here, the Settlement provided for the Court’s continued jurisdiction over \n2  the term of the agreement, but permitted the parties to extend that term and modify the \n3  agreement under certain conditions.  Specifically, the Settlement was set to last for three \n4  and a half years.  See id. §§ 1, 7.  During that period, the Settlement provided that an \n5  independent Monitor would review and analyze data reports provided by Uber to \n6  determine whether the Settlement was effective.  Id. § 8.A.  The Monitor was required to \n7  issue annual reports and, if the Settlement was ineffective, propose further policies or \n8  practices that may improve access for the visually impaired to Uber’s services.  Id.  If the \n9  Monitor proposed such additions, the parties were required to meet and confer to negotiate \n10  whether to modify the Settlement.  Id. § 8.B; see also § 10 (dispute resolution procedure).  \n11  Likewise, if the Monitor determined that Uber had not substantially complied with the \na  12  terms of the Settlement, the term would be extended to five years.  Id. § 7. \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Plaintiffs now seek extension of the Court’s jurisdiction over and modification of \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  the Settlement.  See Dkt. No. 205.  Uber opposes any such modification.  See Dkt. No. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  210. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  II.  Discussion \nS \n n\ndr 17  Settlement agreements, including the one at issue, are contracts overseen and \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  enforced by the Court.  Cf. Kokkonen v.  Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381 \nN\n19  (1994) (describing settlement agreements as “settlement contracts”).  Courts are generally \n20  not permitted to rewrite or modify settlement terms unless permitted by the terms of the \n21  settlement itself.  See Jeff D. v. Andrus, 899 F.2d 753, 758 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing Holmes \n22  v. Continental Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1160 (11th Cir. 1983)). \n23  Here, one of the terms of the Settlement is the duration of the agreement—three and \n24  a half years.  See Settlement §§ 1, 7.  Another is a specific provision that would allow for \n25  extending the settlement term or modifying the settlement itself.  Specifically, the \n26  Settlement provides that “if the Parties agree or the Monitor determines that there has not \n27  been substantial compliance by Uber with the terms of the Agreement for years two and/or \n28  three, the term shall extend to five years . . . .”  Id. § 7.  Likewise, if the Monitor \n  2 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 213   Filed 07/15/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  determines “that Uber’s practices, policies, and procedures are insufficient to address \n2  discrimination because of Service Animals, the Monitor shall propose to the Parties further \n3  modifications to Uber’s policies, practices, and procedures.”  Id. § 8.A.  Then, the parties \n4  may meet and confer, using the dispute resolution procedure outlined in the Settlement if \n5  necessary, to determine whether modifications are necessary.  Id. §§ 8.B, 10. \n6  Here, Plaintiffs have not satisfied those terms and have not shown an equitable basis \n7  to extend the settlement.  First, the Monitor has not recommended extension or \n8  modification.  And second, even if the Monitor and Plaintiffs were prevented from \n9  completing compliance reports in years two and three, Plaintiffs have not shown that Uber \n10  is not in “substantial compliance” with the terms of the Settlement.  Indeed, Plaintiffs do \n11  not allege that Uber failed to comply with the terms of the Settlement, but simply complain \na  12  that service animal discrimination remains pervasive.  But Plaintiffs’ data suggests that \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Uber has in fact decreased the instances of discrimination, albeit only slightly.  See, e.g., \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Dkt. No. 205 at 12.  Plaintiffs, of course, could file a new lawsuit to address such \nrts fo\niD tc 15  discrimination if there is a basis to do so. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Because none of the grounds for extending or modifying the Settlement have been \nS \n n\ndr 17  met, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion to extend the Court’s jurisdiction and to modify \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  the Settlement. \nN\n19  III.  Administrative Motion to Seal \n20  There is a presumption of public access to judicial records and documents.  Nixon v. \n21  Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978).  Access to motions and their \n22  attachments motions and records that are only tangentially related to the merits of the case \n23  may be sealed for “good cause.” Ctr. For Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., 809 F.3d 1092, \n24  1101 (9th Cir. 2016).  The “‘good cause’ standard presents a lower burden for the party \n25  wishing to seal documents than the ‘compelling reasons’ standard.”  Pintos v. Pac. \n26  Creditors Ass’n, 605 F.3d 665, 678 (9th Cir. 2010).  To satisfy good cause, the party \n27  wishing to seal documents must make a “particularized showing” of harm.  See Kamakana \n28  v. City & Cty. Of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1180 (9th Cir. 2006); see also Foltz v. State \n  3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 213   Filed 07/15/20   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 331 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2003) (“good cause” requires the \n2  party to show “that specific prejudice or harm will result”).  “Broad allegations of harm, \n3  unsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning, do not satisfy the Rule 26(c) \n4  test.”  Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Int’l Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 470, 476 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal \n5  quotation marks and citation omitted). \n6  Here, Plaintiffs seek to seal several exhibits to its motion to extend and modify the \n7  Settlement because Uber has designated those documents as confidential.  See Dkt. No. \n8  204.  According to Uber, portions of those exhibits contain nonpublic, precise data \n9  regarding the number of service animal denial complaints received by Uber and its \n10  investigation of those complaints.  Uber also contends that, should that information be \n11  made public, it could easily mislead the public based on improper comparisons to its \na  12  competitors, none of whom publicly release similar reports regarding service animal denial \ntr in\nur\noo 13  complaints.  See Dkt. No. 207 at 6. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Because the precise data contained within some of the exhibits are only tangentially \nrts fo\niD tc 15  related to the merits of the case and could be used for an improper purpose, the Court \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  GRANTS Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to seal Exhibit A to the Declaration of Valerie \nS \n n\ndr 17  Yingling and Exhibits 7, 11, and 19 to the Declaration of Melissa Riess. \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to seal Exhibits 13, 15, and 17 \nN\n19  to the Declaration of Melissa Riess because those exhibits do not contain any sensitive \n20  non-public data. \n21  IV.  Conclusion \n22  The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion to extend the Court’s jurisdiction and to \n23  modify the parties’ settlement agreement. \n24  The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to seal as to Exhibit A of the \n25  Declaration of Valerie Yingling and Exhibits 7, 11, and 19 to the Declaration of Melissa \n26  Riess.  The Court otherwise DENIES the motion as to Exhibits 13, 15, and 17 to the \n27  Declaration of Melissa Riess.  Plaintiff must file unredacted versions of Exhibits 13, 15, \n28  and 17 to the Declaration of Melissa Riess by July 29, 2020. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 213   Filed 07/15/20   Page 5 of 5\n \n1  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n2   \n3  Dated:  July 15, 2020  _____________________________________ \nNATHANAEL M.

The Agreement provides for significant injunctive \n15  relief that will modify Uber’s policies, practices, and procedures to ensure that blind riders \n16  with service animals receive reliable access to transportation arranged through the Uber \n17  rider mobile application (“Uber Rider App”), comprehensive monitoring, a method to \n18  adjust the injunctive relief to address unforeseen access issues that arise, and payment of \n19  attorneys’ fees and costs.  The Parties request an Order from the Court determining that the \n20  settlement is fair and reasonable. \n21  Under the Agreement, Uber will implement an array of policies and practices \n22  nationwide to ensure that blind or visually-disabled riders with service animals (“Riders \n23  with Service Animals”) receive reliable access to transportation arranged through the Uber \n24  app and to effectively address any discriminatory treatment that Riders with Service \n25  Animals encounter from the transportation providers licensed to use the app (“Drivers”) \n26  when attempting to use the Uber Rider App.  Uber will revise its national service animal \n27  policy to clarify that no exceptions exist for allergies or religious objections to the Drivers’ \n28  contractual and legal obligation to transport Riders with Service Animals, will require that \n      2  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 9 of 34\n1  all Drivers who provide transportation through the Uber platform agree to transport riders \n2  with service animals consistent with Drivers’ legal obligation as a condition of continued \n3  access to the Uber platform, and will adopt enhanced enforcement mechanisms, \n4  terminating contractual relationships with Drivers who knowingly refuse to transport \n5  Riders with Service Animals, thus preventing them from receiving trip requests through \n6  the Uber platform.  Uber will also inform riders who submit service animal complaints \n7  about the result of Uber’s investigation of any complaint, including whether Uber severed \n8  its contractual relationship with the driver. \n9  The agreement also provides for comprehensive reporting and monitoring on a \n10  national scale, and provides a procedure to further enhance the injunctive relief if \n11  necessary.  Under the Agreement, Uber will retain and periodically report aggregate data \n12  concerning service animal complaints, trip and enforcement data associated with each \n13  report asserting that a driver refused to transport a rider with a service animal, and trip data \n14  associated with each ride where Uber charged a rider with a service animal a cleaning fee.  \n15  The Agreement additionally provides for a third-party monitor who will review and \n16  evaluate Uber’s compliance with the Agreement.  Moreover, the Agreement allows the \n17  Parties to modify the injunctive relief to address unforeseen service animal access issues \n18  that class members encounter during the term of the agreement. \n19  The Agreement is conditioned on certification of the following proposed class1 for \n20  settlement purposes: \n21  All blind or visually disabled individuals nationwide who travel with the \nassistance of Service Animals and who have used, attempted to use, or been \n22  deterred from attempting to use transportation arranged through the Uber \nRider App. \n23 \n                                              \n24  1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that Uber is not, by stipulating to a settlement on a \nclass basis, waiving any right to seek enforcement of any arbitration agreement and class \n25 \naction waiver and/or representative action waiver between any proposed class member (or \nanyone else) and Uber or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities in any other action or \n26 \nin any other circumstances.  As this is a critical consideration to Uber in agreeing to a class \nsettlement, the Parties request that any approval order expressly reference and confirm this \n27 \npoint. \n28 \n      3  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 10 of 34\n1  The Parties stipulate that certification of the proposed class under Federal Rule of Civil \n2  Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) is appropriate for settlement purposes.  The settlement \n3  contemplated herein would result in a single set of national policies, practices, and \n4  procedures concerning transportation of Riders with Service Animals that is applicable to \n5  all class members.  Similarly, the modifications to current policies, practices, and \n6  procedures in the Agreement will enhance access to transportation arranged through the \n7  Uber Rider App for all class members. \n8  This settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  The settlement process posed \n9  difficult factual questions concerning crafting effective relief for the class while \n10  accounting for Uber’s existing business model, i.e., that the Drivers are independent \n11  contractors.  The Parties effectively addressed this challenge by negotiating an agreement \n12  at arm’s length that provides significant benefits to the class and avoids protracted \n13  litigation, while not altering the Drivers’ relationships with Uber.  Accordingly, the Parties \n14  respectfully request:  (1) approval to file Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, which \n15  adds the National Federation of the Blind as a plaintiff and expands the scope of the case \n16  by asserting class allegations regarding access to all transportation nationwide arranged \n17  through the Uber Rider App, (2) certification of the proposed settlement class under \n18  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2); (3) preliminary approval of the \n19  settlement agreement; (4) an order approving notice to the class of the settlement \n20  agreement and setting a fairness hearing; and (5) final approval of this agreement at the \n21  time of the fairness hearing.  The Parties’ counsel have negotiated the foregoing and agree \n22  to the form and content. \n23  The proposed class will upon final approval release all claims for injunctive or \n24  declaratory relief relating to the subject matter of the Second Amended Complaint, \n25  including claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and any and all applicable state \n26  disability access laws.  The named plaintiffs will also release any and all claims for \n27  damages, while the class will not release any damage claims that may exist. \n28 \n      4  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 11 of 34\n1  THE PARTIES \n2  The National Federation of the Blind (“NFB”), a nonprofit corporation, is the \n3  nation’s oldest and largest association of blind persons.  NFB has affiliates in all fifty \n4  states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  NFB has approximately fifty thousand \n5  members nationwide.  The National Federation of the Blind of California (“NFB-CA”) is \n6  an association of blind Californians and is the California State affiliate of the NFB.  The \n7  mission of NFB and NFB-CA is to promote the vocational, cultural, and social advance-\n8  ment of the blind and to achieve the integration of the blind into society on a basis of \n9  equality with the sighted.  Securing reliable access to transportation, including using \n10  modern technology, advances the goal of NFB and NFB-CA to ensure that blind individ-\n11  uals may travel in the same way that sighted individuals travel.  See Declaration of Mark \n12  Riccobono ¶ 3 (“Riccobono Decl.”); Declaration of Mary Willows ¶ 3 (“Willows Decl.”). \n13  Individual plaintiffs Michael Pedersen and Michael Kelly are legally blind, reside in \n14  California, use guide dogs, and allege that Drivers on the Uber platform refused to \n15  transport them because of their service animals.  Plaintiff Kelly is a member of NFB-CA.  \n16  Individual Plaintiff Michael Hingson is a legally blind resident of California, uses a guide \n17  dog, and is a member of NFB-CA.  Mr. Hingson alleges that he is deterred from \n18  attempting to use transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App because he has \n19  learned from others that Drivers on the Uber platform have refused to transport blind \n20  Riders with guide dogs in California and elsewhere on many occasions. \n21  Uber Technologies Inc. (“Uber”) is a company that offers a smart phone application \n22  (“Uber Rider App”) that connects individuals looking for transportation (“Riders”) with \n23  independent transportation providers looking for passengers (“Driver Partners” or \n24  “Drivers”).  Uber’s platform offers access to multiple different vehicle types based on the \n25  rider’s vehicle preference.  These categories currently include, for example, UberX, \n26  UberPool, UberXL, UberBLACK, UberTaxi, UberSUV, UberSelect, and UberAccess.  \n27  Rasier LLC and Rasier-CA LLC (hereafter referred to collectively with Uber as “Uber”) \n28  are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Uber that provide lead generation services via Uber’s \n      5  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 12 of 34\n1  platform to driver partners.  Transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App is \n2  available in over 150 metropolitan areas across most states. \n3  PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS \n4  NFB-CA and three blind individuals brought this action to challenge alleged \n5  discrimination against blind Riders with guide dogs in the provision of transportation \n6  arranged through the Uber Rider App.  Plaintiffs allege that Uber denies blind Riders with \n7  Service Animals full and equal access to the transportation services that Uber makes \n8  available to other Riders.  Plaintiffs allege that Uber has violated the Americans with \n9  Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et. seq., the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, \n10  California Civil Code §§ 51 et. seq., and the California Disabled Persons Act, California \n11  Civil Code §§ 54-54.3.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief under Plaintiffs’ \n12  ADA and Unruh Act claims.  Plaintiffs Kelly and Pedersen also seek statutory damages \n13  under their state law claims in an amount ranging from $1,000 to $4,000 for each occasion \n14  where a driver on the Uber platform allegedly refused to transport them because of their \n15  service animals, and Plaintiff Hingson seeks statutory damages based on his state law \n16  deterrence claims. \n17  Uber has denied and continues to deny liability under the federal and state laws at \n18  issue, and further asserts that its current policies, practices, and procedures meet its \n19  obligations under applicable law.  Uber has also asserted defenses based on the \n20  applicability of these laws to Uber. \n21  A.  Prelitigation Stage And Initial Litigation \n22  Prior to initiating this litigation, Plaintiffs notified Uber on June 3, 2014 that \n23  Drivers on the Uber platform had refused to transport plaintiffs and many other blind \n24  individuals because of their service animals.  The Parties met but were unable to resolve \n25  the issue, and Plaintiffs initiated this litigation. \n26  On September 9, 2014, Plaintiffs NFB-CA and Hingson filed this action in federal \n27  court in San Francisco.  Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on November 12, \n28  2014.  The FAC joined Plaintiffs Kelly and Pedersen and Defendants Rasier and \n      6  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 13 of 34\n1  Rasier-CA. \n2  On December 3, 2015, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a \n3  claim against all Plaintiffs based on Plaintiffs’ ADA claims and a Motion to Dismiss for \n4  lack of standing against some of the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs opposed the motion.  On \n5  April 17, 2015, this Court issued an order denying Uber’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \n6  claims.  The Court held that all Plaintiffs possessed standing. \n7  B.  Settlement Negotiations And Preparation For Trial \n8  The Parties then complied with the procedures set forth in the Northern District’s \n9  General Order 56.  On May 1, 2015, the Parties exchanged initial disclosures, and \n10  Defendants answered Plaintiffs’ FAC.  On May 8, 2015, the Parties conducted a joint \n11  inspection and review and held an initial in person settlement meeting.  The Parties held an \n12  additional settlement meeting on June 18, 2015.  On August 10, 2015, the Parties held an \n13  all-day mediation before Hon. Jamie Jacobs-May (ret.) at JAMS.  At the end of the \n14  mediation, the Parties agreed to the parameters of a settlement with respect to non-\n15  monetary terms and continued to pursue final settlement regarding all other terms. \n16  On July 30, 2015, the Court opened discovery, and on August 13, 2015, the Court \n17  set a trial date for April, 2016.  Because of the trial schedule, Plaintiffs pursued a two-track \n18  approach, continuing to work toward settlement while preparing for trial.  In September, \n19  2015, Plaintiffs provided Defendants with a written settlement proposal.  The Parties \n20  continued to engage in settlement negotiations, exchanging settlement proposals and \n21  holding conference calls to discuss these proposals.  In addition, beginning October 1, \n22  2015, Plaintiffs served written discovery requests and noticed depositions. \n23  In January 2016, the Parties reached an agreement on the key elements of a \n24  settlement.  Shortly thereafter, the Parties stipulated and the Court ordered that the \n25  discovery deadlines be vacated, and the Court rescheduled the trial for June 13, 2016.  The \n26  Parties continued to negotiate the specific language of certain provisions of the Agreement \n27  and addendums to the Agreement through early April of this year. \n28 \n      7  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 14 of 34\n1  SUMMARY OF THE SETTLEMENT \n2  The proposed settlement includes the following terms. \n3  A.  Enhanced Dissemination Of Information To Drivers. \n4  Uber agrees to enhance distribution of information to Drivers regarding their legal \n5  and contractual obligation to transport Riders with Service Animals.  Uber will require that \n6  new Drivers expressly confirm that they have reviewed, understand, and agree to comply \n7  with their legal obligations as outlined in Uber’s Service Animal Policy during the on-\n8  boarding process and in Uber’s mobile application for Drivers (“Driver App”).  In \n9  addition, both new and existing Drivers will be blocked from receiving trip requests from \n10  Riders through the Uber platform until they confirm in an interactive popup notification in \n11  the Uber Driver App that they are willing to transport Riders with Service Animals.  \n12  Drivers that indicate that they are unwilling to transport Riders with Service Animals will \n13  be permanently blocked from receiving trip requests through the Uber platform and their \n14  contractual relationships with Uber terminated.  Uber will also revise its written \n15  agreements with Drivers to inform Drivers of their legal obligation to transport Riders with \n16  Service Animals and the consequences of refusing to transport Riders with Service \n17  Animals. \n18  In addition, Uber will send quarterly email reminders to all Drivers for the term of \n19  the Agreement reminding them of their legal obligation to transport Riders with Service \n20  Animals.  Uber has and/or will provide Class Counsel with drafts of the quarterly email \n21  reminders and draft revisions to the driver licensing agreement for review and feedback \n22  before issuance. \n23  B.  Changes To Enforcement Practices Related To Nondiscrimination. \n24  Uber will adopt an enhanced enforcement policy, whereby Uber will permanently \n25  terminate its contractual relationship with a driver and permanently terminate that driver’s \n26  ability to receive trip requests through the Uber platform if Uber determines that the driver \n27  knowingly refused to transport a rider because that rider was accompanied by a service \n28  animal anywhere in the United States.  Uber will also permanently terminate its contractual \n      8  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 15 of 34\n1  relationship with a driver and permanently terminate that driver’s ability to receive trip \n2  requests through the Uber platform if Uber receives plausible complaints on more than one \n3  occasion asserting that a driver unlawfully refused to transport Riders with Service \n4  Animals because of the service animal anywhere in the United States, regardless of \n5  whether the driver’s refusal was knowing. \n6  C.  Cleaning Fee Policy For Riders With Service Animals \n7  Uber will not charge Riders with Service Animals cleaning fees for shedding by \n8  their service animals.  Uber will not charge cleaning fees to Riders with Service Animals \n9  for the first two reported messes involving the bodily fluid of the rider’s service animal.  \n10  Riders with service animals will be able to contest cleaning fees. \n11  D.  Changes To Complaint Processing Procedures \n12  Uber will modify the incident reporting features within the Uber rider app and on \n13  the Uber website to enhance Riders’ ability to effectively and efficiently submit service \n14  animal complaints.  Uber will modify the incident reporting form in the Uber Rider App so \n15  that a user can easily mark the submission as a service animal complaint.  Uber will place a \n16  link to a similar form that can be easily located from the homepage of Uber’s website.  A \n17  document presenting the design of the enhanced website and Rider App incident report \n18  forms is attached to the Agreement as Addendum 3. \n19  Uber will forward all service animal complaints that it receives to Uber’s Access \n20  Complaint Team, a team of employees dedicated to handling disability access complaints.  \n21  This team will review and evaluate every report asserting that a driver refused to transport \n22  a rider with a service animal because of the service animal.  Uber will notify each rider \n23  who submitted a service animal complaint that Uber is reviewing the complaint.  Uber will \n24  make reasonable and good faith efforts to, within one week of receiving the complaint, \n25  inform the complainant of the outcome of Uber’s review of the complaint, including \n26  whether Uber has terminated its contractual relationship with the driver who was the \n27  subject of the complaint, and whether Uber has recorded the complaint. \n28  Uber will reverse any cancellation or other fees that were charged in connection \n      9  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 16 of 34\n1  with an incident that is the basis of a service animal complaint.  In addition, Uber will \n2  provide the complaining rider with a $25 account credit if Uber terminates its relationship \n3  with the driver who is the subject of the complaint.  Information will be distributed to the \n4  blind community, either by Uber or in conjunction with NFB or NFB-CA, about the \n5  enhanced methods for submitting service animal complaints, and Uber’s policy to \n6  reimburse complaining Riders for trip cancellation charges. \n7  Uber will provide the Access Complaint Team and other employees who review \n8  these complaints with a guidance document, attached as Addendum 2 to the Agreement, \n9  that provides step-by-step instructions on evaluating a report that a driver refused to \n10  transport a rider with a service animal because of the service animal.  This document also \n11  provides guidance on when charging cleaning fees to Riders with Service Animals is \n12  permissible.  Uber will train the Team on identifying situations where a driver has violated \n13  Uber’s service animal policy. \n14  E.  Revisions To Uber’s Service Animal Policy \n15  Uber will adopt a revised written service animal policy that incorporates the \n16  enhanced enforcement policy, enhanced procedures for investigating and acting on service \n17  animal complaints, and the cleaning fee policy for Riders with Service Animals established \n18  by the agreement.  The updated document also clarifies that there are no exceptions for \n19  allergies or religious objections to Drivers’ contractual and legal obligations to transport \n20  Riders with Service Animals.  It further clarifies what questions Drivers may and may not \n21  ask Riders with Service Animals about their service animals under applicable law.  The \n22  updated policy is attached to the Agreement as Addendum 4. \n23  F.  Compliance Record Keeping And Testing \n24  Uber will collect and retain a national database of information to facilitate \n25  monitoring compliance with the Agreement.  This information will include rider, driver, \n26  and trip data associated with each report that asserts that a driver refused to transport a \n27  rider with a service animal because of the service animal, and each ride that results in Uber \n28  charging a rider with a service animal a cleaning fee.  It will also include information \n      10  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 17 of 34\n1  concerning actions that Uber took with respect to the driver and the rider in connection \n2  with each service animal complaint.  Furthermore, it will include the number of service \n3  animal complaints that Uber received and the number of Drivers with whom Uber has \n4  terminated its contractual relationship due to violation of Uber’s service animal policy \n5  during the reporting period. \n6  Uber will report this data to Class Counsel quarterly for the first year of the term of \n7  the Agreement, biannually for the second year of the term, and annually for the remainder \n8  of the term.  However, if the number of service animal complaints significantly increases \n9  or if it is determined that Uber did not comply with the Agreement, Uber will resume \n10  reporting on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the Agreement’s term. \n11  NFB and NFB-CA will administer a compliance testing program for the term of the \n12  Agreement.  The testing program will deploy blind individuals with guide dogs across the \n13  United States who will request and take trips using the Rider App to evaluate Uber’s \n14  compliance with the Agreement. \n15  G.  Third-Party Monitor \n16  A monitor will be selected to review, evaluate, and report annually on Uber’s \n17  compliance with the Agreement.  The monitor will propose further modifications to Uber’s \n18  policies, practices, and procedures if the monitor concludes that Uber’s policies, practices, \n19  and procedures are insufficient to ensure equal access for Riders with Service Animals. \n20  The Parties will attempt to jointly select the monitor.  If the Parties are unable to \n21  select a monitor, the Parties will each submit three proposed candidates to the magistrate \n22  judge who retains jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement, and the magistrate judge will \n23  select the monitor.  This approach will be used to select a replacement monitor if \n24  necessary. \n25  Uber will pay the monitor’s reasonable fees and costs, which will be originally \n26  capped at $50,000 for the 3.5 year term of the Agreement, and an additional $35,000 for \n27  the 1.5 year extension period if the agreement’s term is extended.  Negotiating increases to \n28  these caps is subject to the Agreement’s dispute resolution process. \n      11  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 18 of 34\n1  H.  Duration Of The Agreement. \n2  The default term of the Agreement is 3.5 years.  However, if the Parties agree or the \n3  monitor determines that Uber did not substantially comply with the Agreement during the \n4  second and/or third year of the Agreement’s term, the Agreement’s term will extend by 1.5 \n5  years to a total of five years. \n6  I.  Further Modifications To Uber’s Policies, Practices, And Procedures \n7  Beginning one year after the effective date of the Agreement, the Parties may \n8  negotiate additional modifications, upon Plaintiffs’ request, to Uber’s policies, practices, \n9  and procedures concerning transporting blind Riders with Service Animals.  The Parties \n10  included this provision to provide the flexibility to further enhance the injunctive relief if \n11  monitoring reveals it necessary, and to address unintended consequences of the relief or \n12  unforeseen service animal access issues that arise during the Agreement’s term.  If the \n13  Parties reach an agreement on modifications, it will be memorialized in a binding written \n14  memorandum of understanding.  If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement, Plaintiffs \n15  may use the Agreement’s dispute resolution process to attempt to secure additional \n16  modifications to Uber’s relevant policies, practices, and procedures, but in no event will \n17  the modifications lessen the benefits or protections for members of the settlement class. \n18  J.  Dispute Resolution Process \n19  Enforcement of the Agreement will be subject to continuing jurisdiction of the \n20  Court.  The Parties request that, upon final approval of the Agreement, Magistrate Judge \n21  Cousins retain jurisdiction to oversee enforcement of the Agreement, including resolving \n22  disputes regarding Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs for work performed after \n23  the effective date of the Agreement.  If Magistrate Judge Cousins is or becomes \n24  unavailable, the Parties request that the Court appoint another magistrate judge in the \n25  Northern District of California to retain jurisdiction over this matter. \n26  The Agreement establishes a three-step procedure for resolving disputes.  First, the \n27  Parties will meet and confer to attempt to resolve the dispute.  If the Parties are unable to \n28  resolve the dispute within twenty-one days after Plaintiffs’ raised the issue and if Uber is \n      12  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 19 of 34\n1  willing to pay for a mediation, the Parties will submit the dispute for mediation at JAMS.  \n2  Finally, if the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, or if the Parties \n3  are unable to resolve the dispute through meeting and conferring within twenty-one days \n4  after Plaintiffs first raised the issue and Uber is unwilling to pay the cost of a JAMS \n5  mediation, the Parties will submit the matter to the magistrate judge who retains \n6  jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement for binding resolution of the dispute. \n7  K.  Compensation To NFB \n8  Uber will make three annual payments of $75,000 to NFB during the first three \n9  years of the Agreement’s term.  If the term of the Agreement is extended to five years, \n10  Uber will make a fourth payment of $75,000 to NFB at the beginning of the extended term. \n11  L.  Payments To Individual Plaintiffs \n12  Uber will pay a total of $45,000 which will be apportioned equally among the three \n13  individual Plaintiffs, Michael Pedersen, Michael Kelly, and Michael Hingson.  These \n14  payments will resolve the individual Plaintiffs’ state law damages claims. \n15  M.  Attorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expenses, And Costs \n16  No later than fourteen days before the deadline for class members to submit \n17  objections to the Agreement, Class Counsel will move the Court for an award of \n18  reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for their work on this matter up through the effective \n19  date of the Agreement.  Class Counsel will include instructions for accessing this motion \n20  in the notice to the class.  Uber agrees that the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover reasonable \n21  attorneys’ fees and costs for Class Counsel’s work on this matter up through the effective \n22  date of the Agreement, but Uber may dispute the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs. \n23  The Agreement establishes a procedure for recovery of Plaintiffs’ reasonable \n24  attorneys’ fees and costs for work performed after the Agreement is executed for \n25  monitoring and enforcement.  Beginning one year after the effective date, Class Counsel \n26  will annually submit a request for reasonable fees, costs, and expenses for work performed \n27  under this agreement.  If Uber contests the requested amount, the Parties will attempt to \n28  negotiate a resolution.  The Parties will submit the dispute for resolution by the magistrate \n      13  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 20 of 34\n1  judge who retains jurisdiction if the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 60 \n2  days. \n3  N.  Objecting To The Settlement Agreement \n4   If this agreement is preliminarily approved and the proposed settlement class is \n5  certified, the Parties will distribute notice to the settlement class in the manner approved \n6  by this Court within sixty (60) days from the date of the Court’s order preliminarily \n7  approving the agreement.  The notice to class members will describe the agreement and \n8  inform them of their right to object to the agreement.  The notice disseminated to members \n9  of the settlement class is attached as Exhibit 3 to the Paradis Declaration.  Uber will pay \n10  KCC LLC, a class settlement administrator, to post the notice on a settlement website that \n11  KCC will maintain for this settlement, and to publish the notice in publications distributed \n12  by the National Federation of the Blind and the American Council of the Blind, the two \n13  largest associations of blind persons in the country. \n14  O.  Release Of Individual Damages Claims And Class Injunctive Claims \n15  In exchange for the injunctive relief in this Agreement, Plaintiffs and the settlement \n16  class agree to release any injunctive relief and declaratory relief claims against Uber \n17  relating to the subject matter of the litigation.  The release will apply to claims that arose \n18  before the effective date of the Agreement. \n19  In exchange for the damages relief in the Agreement, the named Plaintiffs also \n20  release all of their damages claims against Uber relating to the subject matter of the \n21  litigation.  The settlement class, however, will not release any damages claims. \n22  ARGUMENT \n23  I.  CERTIFYING THE CLASS IS APPROPRIATE UNDER FED. R. CIV. P. \n23(a) AND (b)(2)2 \n24 \nThe Parties have stipulated to seek certification of the following settlement class at \n25 \n                                              \n26  2 To be clear, Defendants join in this motion only for settlement purposes and do not waive \nany defenses they might raise as to class certification or the standing of Plaintiffs to pursue \n27 \nthe relief sought herein should settlement approval not be granted. \n28 \n      14  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 21 of 34\n1  the time of the fairness hearing: \n2  all blind or visually disabled individuals nationwide who travel with the \nassistance of Service Animals and who have used, attempted to use, or been \n3  deterred from attempting to use transportation arranged through the Uber \nRider App.  \n4   \n5  The proposed settlement class is coextensive with the proposed class set forth in the \n6  Second Amended Complaint.  The class includes all individuals with service animals who \n7  have been deterred from attempting to use transportation arranged through the Uber Rider \n8  App because the parties agree for settlement purposes that these persons have standing to \n9  allege that Uber has violated their rights under the ADA and equivalent state laws.  Nat’l \n10  Fed’n of the Blind v. Uber Techs., Inc., 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1080-82 (N.D. Cal. 2015). \n11  A.  The Proposed Class Meets The Numerosity, Typicality, Commonality, \nAnd Adequacy Requirements Of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) \n12   \n13  Plaintiffs assert, and Defendants do not contest for purposes of settlement only, that \n14  the proposed class satisfies the four threshold requirements for class certification under \n15  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).  These requirements are:  (1) numerosity of \n16  potential class members, (2) commonality of factual and legal issues among class \n17  members, (3) typicality of the class representatives’ claims, and (4) adequate \n18  representation of class-wide interests by class representatives and class counsel. \n19  1.  The Proposed Class Meets The Numerosity Requirement \n20  A class meets the numerosity requirement if the class is so large that joinder of all \n21  members would be impracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); Evon v. Law Offices of Sidney \n22  Mickell, 688 F.3d 1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (certifying class of 262 individuals); Gay v. \n23  Waiters’ & Dairy Lunchmen’s Union, 489 F. Supp. 282 (N.D. Cal. 1980), aff’d, 649 F.2d \n24  531 (9th Cir. 1982) (certifying class of 184 identified potential class members).  A class \n25  consisting of forty or more individuals may satisfy the numerosity requirement.  Amone v. \n26  Aveiro, 226 F.R.D. 677, 684-85 (D. Haw. 2005) (certifying class where thirty members \n27  had been identified and class likely had more than forty members).  When “the exact size \n28  of the class is unknown, but general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, \n      15  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 22 of 34\n1  the numerosity requirement is satisfied.”  In re Abbott Laboratories Norvir Anti-Trust \n2  Litigation, Nos. C 04-1511 CW, C 04-4203 CW, 2007 WL 1689899, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jun. \n3  11, 2007) (quoting 1 Alba Cone & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 3.3 \n4  (4th ed. 2002)). \n5  The proposed class has well over forty members, and likely includes hundreds or \n6  thousands, easily satisfying the numerosity requirement.  Plaintiffs have identified seventy-\n7  four blind individuals who use service animals and belong to the class.  Paradis Decl. ¶ 33.  \n8  There are likely hundreds or thousands of additional class members.  Approximately ten \n9  thousand blind individuals use guide dogs in the United States, and blind individuals also \n10  use service animals for other purposes.  Id.  Over one hundred thousand Drivers provide \n11  transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App in over 150 metropolitan areas \n12  nationwide.  Thus, Plaintiffs submit that hundreds or thousands of blind individuals who \n13  travel with service animals across the United States have actually used, or have reason to \n14  and the opportunity to use transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App. \n15  2.  The Proposed Class Satisfies The Commonality Requirement \n16  The Ninth Circuit construes the commonality requirement permissively.  To satisfy \n17  this requirement, there must be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. \n18  Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “[A]ll that Rule 23(a)(2) requires is ‘a single significant question of law \n19  or fact’” that will “generate common answers[.]”  Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Associates, Inc., \n20  731 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, \n21  589 (9th Cir. 2012)).  In civil rights actions, “commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit \n22  challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.  \n23  Under such circumstances, individual factual differences among class members pose no \n24  obstacle to commonality.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 682 (9th Cir. 2014); Hernandez \n25  v. Cnty of Monterey, 305 F.R.D. 132, 153 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (commonality satisfied in \n26  action including ADA claims where defendants operating jail had system-wide policies \n27  and practices concerning inmate medical care, mental health care, and safety needs). \n28  Here, Plaintiffs contend, and Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes \n      16  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 23 of 34\n1  only, that the commonality requirement is satisfied because Uber has system-wide policies \n2  and practices related to transporting Riders with Service Animals.  Plaintiffs contend, and \n3  Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes only, that Uber has a single nationwide \n4  service animal policy, that Riders nationwide submit service animal complaints in a similar \n5  manner, and that Uber will, as part of the settlement, implement uniform practices and \n6  procedures nationwide for responding to complaints that Drivers have refused to transport \n7  Riders with Service Animals.  In addition, Drivers’ refusal to transport blind Riders with \n8  Service Animals similarly affects members of the proposed class.  They are all either \n9  denied transportation and/or deterred from attempting to use transportation arranged \n10  through the Uber Rider App.  Plaintiff further contends, and Defendants do not contest for \n11  settlement purposes only, that the determination of whether Uber’s policies and practices \n12  concerning transporting blind Riders with Service Animals comply with state and federal \n13  disability law will not vary based on the particular facts of each denial of service or \n14  instance of deterrence. \n15  3.  The Proposed Class Satisfies The Typicality Requirement \n16  The named class representatives must have claims that are typical of those of the \n17  class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “The test of typicality ‘is whether other members have the \n18  same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the \n19  named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured by the same course \n20  of conduct.’” Evon, 688 F.3d at 1030 (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d \n21  497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).  Representative claims are typical if they are “reasonably co-\n22  extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.”  \n23  Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2012) \n24  (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998)).  “Differing \n25  factual scenarios resulting in a claim of the same nature as other class members does not \n26  defeat typicality.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686 (typicality satisfied where named plaintiffs \n27  were state prisoners who asserted exposure, like other members of putative class, to risk of \n28  future harm by challenged policies and practices, even if named plaintiffs might have \n      17  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 24 of 34\n1  previously suffered varying injuries or have differing healthcare needs). \n2  Plaintiffs allege, and Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes only, that \n3  the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class.  Proposed class \n4  representatives Michael Kelly, Michael Pedersen, and Michael Hingson all have the same \n5  disability and travel using the same mobility aid as other class members.  They are blind \n6  and use service animals.  Plaintiffs contend they have all also alleged the same injury as \n7  other members of the class due to the same conduct.  Plaintiffs further contend they have \n8  all alleged denial of transportation or deterrence from attempting to access transportation \n9  through the Uber Rider App because Drivers on the Uber platform have refused to \n10  transport Riders with Service Animals and because Uber has not adopted practices and \n11  procedures adequate to prevent this conduct.  Kelly Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Hingson Decl. ¶ 5; \n12  Pedersen Decl. ¶ 4-5.  NFB and NFB–CA are each membership organizations and have \n13  members who have been denied rides because they are blind persons using service animals \n14  and members deterred from using transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App by \n15  the practices at issue.  Each has a mission to support full integration and equal access for \n16  blind persons.  Plaintiffs contend that neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested in \n17  this action require participation of individual members because injunctive relief has been \n18  the principle goal sought.  Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind v. Target Corp., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1185, \n19  1192 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (holding that NFB and NFB-CA had standing to pursue claims on \n20  behalf of class of blind persons). \n21  4.  Class Representatives And Experienced Class Counsel Here \nEasily Meet The Adequacy Requirement \n22   \n23  Finally, named Plaintiffs and class counsel must both adequately represent the class \n24  to satisfy Rule 23(a).  To establish adequacy, the named plaintiffs and class counsel must:  \n25  (1) not have conflicts of interest with the proposed class, and (2) prosecute the action \n26  vigorously on behalf of the class.  Evon, 688 F.3d at 1031; see also In re LinkedIn User \n27  Privacy Litigation, 309 F.R.D. 573, 584-85 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (adequacy requirement \n28  satisfied where named plaintiff and other members of class shared interest in securing \n      18  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 25 of 34\n1  relief, there was no evidence of conflicts of interest, named plaintiff demonstrated \n2  willingness to vigorously prosecute case, and class counsel had relevant experience). \n3  Plaintiffs contend, and Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes only, that \n4  no conflicts exist between named Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the settlement class with \n5  respect to the negotiation and consummation of the terms of this settlement.  All named \n6  Plaintiffs and other class members seek the same relief here:  changes to Uber’s policies \n7  and practices that will ensure that they consistently receive full and equal access to \n8  transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App.  By ensuring that all Drivers are \n9  aware of and agree to comply with their legal and contractual obligation to transport Riders \n10  with Service Animals and enhancing Uber’s practices related to enforcing its agreements \n11  with Drivers and the service animal policy, the proposed agreement is crafted to provide \n12  such relief. \n13  In addition, Plaintiffs contend that the named Plaintiffs and class counsel have \n14  vigorously pursued relief for the class.  Named Plaintiffs have knowledge of the case and \n15  of their duties as class representatives, and are willing to continue to prosecute this action \n16  if necessary.  Riccobono Decl. ¶ 5; Willows Decl. ¶ 5; Kelly Decl. ¶ 7; Pedersen Decl. ¶ 6; \n17  Hingson Decl. ¶ 6. \n18  Only the individual named Plaintiffs receive damages under the Settlement.  These \n19  damages payments are based on multiple instances in which they allege they have been \n20  denied access to or been deterred from attempting to access transportation through the \n21  Uber Rider App.  Pedersen Decl. ¶¶ 4-5; Kelly Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Hingson Decl. ¶ 5.  The \n22  damage payments are in exchange for a release of the individual plaintiffs’ damages \n23  claims.  The damage claims have always been secondary to the goal of seeking equal \n24  access to the Uber transportation services, which the Agreement achieves for the class.  \n25  The compromise here that does not provide for damages to absent class members but does \n26  not disturb their damage claims is reasonable.  Continuing to litigate the case for damages \n27  purposes would not serve the best interests of the class.  See Paradis Decl. ¶ 20. \n28  Plaintiffs contend that Class Counsel has vigorously pursued relief here on behalf of \n      19  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 26 of 34\n1  the class through litigation and eventually through detailed arms-length settlement \n2  negotiations.  See Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1021 (vigorous representation measured by \n3  “competency of counsel and … an assessment of the rationale for not pursuing further \n4  litigation”).  Class Counsel has served as Class Counsel in numerous and varied disability \n5  rights cases across the country.  Paradis Decl. ¶¶ 8-14.  Based on Class Counsel’s \n6  experience litigating disability claims concerning transportation access, the practices and \n7  procedures that this Agreement authorizes will successfully ensure that blind Riders with \n8  Service Animals will consistently receive full and equal access to transportation arranged \n9  through the Uber Rider App.  The relief that the Agreement provides demonstrates that \n10  further litigation is unnecessary to remedy the class claims.  In addition, attempting to \n11  reach a resolution through additional litigation could have taken years and, due to the \n12  novel nature of the claims, might not have yielded a resolution as favorable as that \n13  contained in the proposed settlement. \n14  5.  The Ascertainability Requirement Does Not Apply Here, But \nEven If It Did, The Class Is Sufficiently Ascertainable \n15   \n16  Plaintiffs allege, and Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes only, that \n17  the ascertainability requirement does not apply to classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  In \n18  re Yahoo Mail Litigation, 308 F.R.D. 577, 597 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (holding ascertainability \n19  requirement inapplicable to (b)(2) class and noting that Ninth Circuit has not ruled on the \n20  issue but other circuits have held the requirement inapplicable to (b)(2) classes); Dunakin \n21  v. Quigley, 99 F. Supp. 3d 1297, 1386 (W.D. Wash. 2015); Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d \n22  554, 563 (3d Cir. 2015); Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004) \n23  (explaining “lack of identifiability” of class members cannot defeat certification of a (b)(2) \n24  class and “many courts have found Rule 23(b)(2) well suited for cases where the \n25  composition of a class is not readily ascertainable”). \n26  Even if the Court concludes that the ascertainability requirement applies, Plaintiffs \n27  allege that the class here is ascertainable.  In this circuit, ascertainability may be satisfied if \n28  the class is defined with “objective criteria” and if it is “administratively feasible to \n      20  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 27 of 34\n1  determine whether a particular individual is a member of the class.”  Lanovaz v. Twinings \n2  North America, Inc., 2014 WL 1652338, at *2–3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2014) (quoting \n3  Wolph v. Acer Am. Corp., No. 09–01314, 2012 WL 993531, at *1–2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, \n4  2012)); see also Astiana v Kashi Co., 291 F.R.D. 493, 500 (S.D. Cal. 2013) (if “the class \n5  definition is sufficiently definite to identify putative class members,” the challenges of \n6  administering the class will not defeat certification) (citations omitted). \n7  Plaintiffs allege the proposed class satisfies this standard.  Membership in the class \n8  can be determined by a short list of common characteristics.  Class members must (1) have \n9  a vision disability, (2) travel with a service animal, and (3) have used, attempted to use, or \n10  been deterred from using transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App because of \n11  their service animal.  Plaintiffs further contend that determining whether a rider with a \n12  vision disability who uses a service animal belongs to the class as a deterred individual is \n13  simple:  that person must have learned of reports that Drivers had refused to transport other \n14  blind Riders who use service animals, and as a result of knowledge of such reports, \n15  declined to attempt to use transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App on a \n16  specific occasion. \n17  B.  The Proposed Class Meets the Requirements Of Rule 23(b)(2) \n18  Rule 23(b)(2) was designed to facilitate civil rights class actions.  Parsons, 754 F.3d \n19  at 686.  Plaintiffs assert, and Defendants do not contest for settlement purposes only, that it \n20  is “unquestionably satisfied when members of a putative class seek uniform injunctive or \n21  declaratory relief from policies or practices that are generally applicable to the class as a \n22  whole.”  Id. at 688 (certifying (b)(2) class of prisoners challenging defendant’s centralized \n23  policies and practices of “uniform and statewide application” even where those practices \n24  “may not affect every member of the proposed class … in exactly the same way”); Fed. R. \n25  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2) is “‘almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily \n26  seeking injunctive relief.’”  Gray v. Golden Gate Nat’l Recreational Area, 279 F.R.D. 501, \n27  520 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (quoting Baby Neal for and by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3rd \n28  Cir. 1994)).  “Cases challenging an entity’s policies and practices regarding access for the \n      21  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 28 of 34\n1  disabled represent the mine run of disability rights class actions certified under Rule \n2  23(b)(2).”  Californians for Disability Rights, Inc. v. Cal. Dep’t of Transp., 249 F.R.D. \n3  334, 345 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (certifying (b)(2) class of persons with disabilities challenging \n4  transportation agency’s use of deficient design guidelines and provision of inaccessible \n5  facilities) (collecting cases). \n6  Certifying the proposed settlement class under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate for \n7  settlement purposes because the Agreement will result in uniform class wide injunctive \n8  relief by modifying Uber’s national policies and practices applicable to the overall class.  \n9  Plaintiffs contend that Uber has and/or will have one set of national policies and practices \n10  concerning transportation of blind Riders with Service Animals.  All members of the \n11  proposed class are subject to the effects of these common policies and practices.  \n12  Certification is also appropriate because the Agreement provides only injunctive relief to \n13  the class, and only incidentally includes payments to the individual named Plaintiffs to \n14  resolve their individual damages claims. \n15  II.  PRELIMINARILY APPROVING THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT IS \nAPPROPRIATE \n16   \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) conditions the settlement of any class action \n18  on court approval.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1025.  Preliminary approval of a settlement allows \n19  the parties to efficiently determine whether the proposed settlement is “within the range of \n20  possible judicial approval[.]”  Grant v. Capital Management Services, L.P., 10–cv–2471–\n21  WQH (BGS), 2013 WL 6499698, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 11, 2013) (quoting In re M.L. Stern \n22  Overtime Litig., 07–CV–0118–BTM (JMA), 2009 WL 995864, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 13, \n23  2009)).  A court may probe the parties’ consensual agreement only “to ensure that it is \n24  ‘fair, adequate, and free from collusion.’”  Lane v. Facebook, Inc., 696 F.3d 811, 819 (9th \n25  Cir. 2012) (Quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1027).  In addition, there is a presumption of \n26  fairness when “the settlement agreement was reached in arm's length negotiations after \n27  relevant discovery [has] taken place[.].”  In re Immune Response Securities Litigation, 97 \n28  F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1171 (C.D. Cal. 2007). \n      22  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 29 of 34\n1  Courts consider the following factors to determine whether a settlement is fair, \n2  adequate, and reasonable:  (1) the strength of the plaintiff’s case; (2) the risk, expense, \n3  complexity, and likely duration of further litigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class action \n4  status throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered in settlement; (5) the extent of discovery \n5  completed and the stage of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views of counsel; \n6  (7) the presence of a government participant; and (8) the reaction of the class members to \n7  the proposed settlement.  Lane, 696 F.3d at 819.3 \n8  The proposed settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable.  By \n9  implementing a set of policies, practices, and procedures concerning Riders with Service \n10  Animals, the Agreement is crafted to provide the class with full and equal access to \n11  transportation available through the Uber Rider App.  Uber will significantly enhance its \n12  procedures for informing all new and existing Drivers in the United States about their legal \n13  and contractual obligation to transport Riders with Service Animals, and require that every \n14  driver nationwide agree to transport Riders with Service Animals and provide informed \n15  consent to Uber’s service animal policy as a condition of continuing to provide \n16  transportation arranged through the Uber platform.  Uber will also enhance its service \n17  animal enforcement practices and investigation and response practices.  The Agreement \n18  provides for extensive third-party monitoring and testing, and provides a method to adjust \n19  the injunctive relief if monitoring and testing indicate that modifications are necessary.  In \n20  sum, this Agreement comprehensively addresses measures to ensure that class members \n21  receive reliable access to transportation arranged through the Uber Rider App, and it \n22  contains flexibility to address unanticipated service animal access issues that may arise \n23  during the Agreement’s term. \n24  Additionally, all parties have concluded that the settlement is appropriate after \n25 \n                                              \n26  3 The last two factors are not relevant here.  Although the government filed a Statement of \nInterest in this Action, the government did not participate in settlement negotiations and is \n27 \nnot a party to the settlement.  Preliminary approval also occurs before notice to the class. \n28 \n      23  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 30 of 34\n1  exchanging pertinent information and weighing the benefits of this agreement against the \n2  risks, costs, and delay of continued litigation.  The Parties’ thorough settlement \n3  discussions, which included two in-person settlement meetings, a day-long mediation at \n4  JAMS, and other exchanges of information, have provided them with ample information \n5  with which to evaluate the settlement agreement.  Paradis Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17-20.  For \n6  example, the Parties exchanged information concerning Uber’s training of customer \n7  support staff, the on-boarding process for new Drivers on the Uber platform, internal \n8  procedures for investigating service animal complaints, the Uber Driver App, the Uber \n9  driver portal, and Uber’s driver-rider matching process.  Paradis Decl. ¶¶ 19-20.  \n10  Accounting for this information, the Parties concluded that the agreed upon modifications \n11  to Uber’s policies, practices, and procedures will provide effective relief to the class while \n12  efficiently and expeditiously resolving disputed issues. \n13  In contrast, additional litigation would involve uncertainty and delay for all parties.  \n14  The extensive factual issues and novel legal issues in the case would involve extensive \n15  resources at trial, including the use of experts.  Both parties agree that the litigation risks \n16  presented by this case are significant. \n17  Furthermore, counsel experienced in class action litigation crafted the proposed \n18  agreement.  Class counsel are well-qualified litigators with specialized expertise with \n19  major class actions to improve programmatic access for persons with disabilities to \n20  transportation and to other private and public entities.  Paradis Decl. ¶¶ 8-14.  Counsel for \n21  Defendants also possesses substantial experience defending corporate clients against class \n22  actions.  Counsel on both sides view this agreement as a successful compromise that will \n23  resolve class members’ claims in a fair and efficient manner. \n24  The Agreement is presumptively fair because its negotiation was thorough and \n25  conducted at arm’s length.  The Parties attended several in-person settlement meetings and \n26  a full-day mediation, and exchanged several versions of the settlement agreement and \n27  addendums before arriving at language and remedies that all parties found acceptable.  \n28  Class representatives attended the mediation and participated in settlement negotiations.  \n      24  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 31 of 34\n1  Pedersen Decl. ¶ 7; Hingson Decl. ¶ 7; Willows Decl. ¶ 6.  The named Plaintiffs have \n2  reviewed the terms of the settlement agreement and fully support it.  Pedersen Decl. ¶ 8; \n3  Kelly decl. ¶ 9; Hingson Decl. ¶ 8; Willows Decl. ¶ 7; Riccobono Decl. ¶ 7.  That the \n4  Parties negotiated an agreement on the injunctive relief for the benefit of the proposed \n5  Settlement Class while leaving determination of Plaintiffs’ claims for attorney’s fees and \n6  costs for later negotiation and/or for the Court to determine further demonstrates the \n7  absence of any collusion. \n8  III.  THE COURT SHOULD DIRECT DISTRIBUTION OF THE NOTICE OF \nSETTLEMENT \n9   \n10  Notice to a settlement class certified under Rule 23(b)(2) is within the Court’s \n11  discretion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(a), (e)(1); Kim v. Space Pencil, Inc., C 11–03796 LB, \n12  2012 WL 5948951, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2012).  Notice provided under Rule 23(e) \n13  must ““generally describe[ ] the terms of the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those \n14  with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come forward and be heard.”  Lane, 696 F.3d \n15  at 826 (quoting Rodriguez v. West Publ’g Corp., 563 F.3d 948, 962 (9th Cir. 2009)). \n16  The Parties have agreed on a form of notice and a notice distribution plan that will \n17  effectively inform the class about the settlement and their right to object.  The notice \n18  summarizes the key components of the settlement and provides procedures for submitting \n19  objections and for participating in the fairness hearing.  KCC LLC, the settlement \n20  administrator, will maintain a settlement website during the notice period, and the Parties \n21  will post the notice and Settlement Agreement on this website.  The website and the notice \n22  will be compatible with screen reading technology that blind persons use to operate \n23  computers.  Within sixty days of the order preliminarily approving the Agreement, KCC \n24  will also publish the notice in the newsletters and magazines of the National Federation of \n25  the Blind and the American Council of the Blind, the largest associations of blind persons \n26  in the U.S. \n27  Class Counsel will also distribute the notice.  Class Counsel will electronically mail \n28  the notice in a screen reader compatible format to persons who contacted Class Counsel to \n      25  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 32 of 34\n1  complain about access to transportation available through the Uber Rider App for Riders \n2  with Service Animals and for whom Class Counsel has email addresses.  Class Counsel \n3  will also post the notice on the websites of Disability Rights Advocates, Rosen Bien \n4  Galvan & Grunfeld, LLP, and TRE Legal Practice for the duration of the notice period.  \n5  Class Counsel will arrange for the notice to be electronically mailed to the membership \n6  email list serves for the NFB, the American Council of the Blind, the National Association \n7  of Guide Dog Users, and Guide Dog Users, Inc.  Uber will also post a link to the \n8  settlement notice on its news blog (newsroom.uber.com). \n9  This distribution of the notice is likely to reach thousands of class members.  The \n10  NFB’s magazine is distributed to approximately 35,000 people.  Paradis Decl. ¶ 29.  Many \n11  of the other publications through which notice will be distributed each are circulated to \n12  thousands of individuals.  Id. ¶¶ 29-31.  Many recipients of these publications are class \n13  members.  Id. ¶¶ 30-31. \n14  IV.  THE COURT SHOULD APPROVE THE PROPOSED SCHEDULING \nORDER \n15   \n16  The Parties are submitting herewith a proposed scheduling order including dates for \n17  issuance of the notice, deadlines for objections, a date for the fairness hearing to determine \n18  final approval of the agreement, and related orders and deadlines.  The Parties request that \n19  the Court enter this proposed order with such changes as the Court deems appropriate. \n20  CONCLUSION \n21  The proposed settlement will benefit individuals with vision disabilities who travel \n22  with service animals nationwide.  Plaintiffs hope that this Agreement will serve as a model \n23  for the ride sharing industry on ensuring access for Riders with Service Animals.  It is a \n24  fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement of the claims at issue.  The Parties therefore \n25  request that the Court approve filing of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, \n26  conditionally certify the proposed settlement class, give preliminary approval to the  \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n      26  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND RELATED MOTIONS \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 84   Filed 04/29/16   Page 33 of 34\n1  proposed agreement, approve the proposed notice, and issue the proposed scheduling \n2  order, including setting a date for a fairness hearing. \n3   \n4  DATED: April 29, 2016  Respectfully submitted, \n \n5 \nROSEN BIEN GALVAN & GRUNFELD LLP \n   \n6 \n   \n7  By:   \n  Michael S.

Nos. 185, 189 \n n\ndr 17 \nee\nth In this class action, plaintiffs National Federation of the Blind (“NFIB”) and various \nintr\nUo 18 \nN disabled individuals accused defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. of failing to accommodate \n19 \ntheir disabled customers traveling with service animals.  In 2016, the parties settled the \n20 \nclass action.  Plaintiffs now bring their second motion for attorneys’ fees and costs seeking \n21 \nreimbursement for their efforts monitoring Uber’s compliance with the settlement.  See \n22 \nDkt. No. 185.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to fees, but certain fees are \n23 \nunreasonable.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n24 \nPlaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. \n25 \nI.  Procedural History \n26 \nIn September 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this class action against Uber alleging \n27 \ndiscrimination against the blind under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \n28 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 2 of 17\n \n1  U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. and various California-law analogues.  See Dkt. No. 1.  The parties \n2  settled the case in January 2016 (see Dkt. No. 70; see also Dkt. No. 85-1 (“Settlement”)) \n3  and the Court granted final approval of the class settlement on December 6, 2016 (see Dkt. \n4  No. 139).  On December 15, 2016, the Court awarded Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees and costs \n5  pursuant to the Settlement.  See Dkt. Nos. 139, 144. \n6  Plaintiffs now seek additional attorneys’ fees and costs for resources expended in \n7  monitoring Uber’s settlement compliance.  See Dkt. No. 185.  Plaintiffs voluntarily agree \n8  to reduce their claimed amount by 5% across the board.  See id. at 19.1  Uber opposes, \n9  arguing that Plaintiffs are not entitled to additional fees and, even if they were, Plaintiffs’ \n10  request is unreasonable.  See generally Dkt. No. 187. \n11  II.  Settlement Agreement \na  12  Certain sections of the Settlement are relevant to this motion.  The Court \ntr in\nur\noo 13  summarizes those portions below. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  The Settlement requires Uber to “collect and report to Plaintiffs’ Counsel” rating \nrts fo\niD tc 15  and complaint information for riders with service animals.  See Settlement § 6.A.  Uber is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  required to report the raw data for that information to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  Id. § 6.B.1.  In \nS \n n\ndr 17  addition, if Plaintiffs’ Counsel provides Uber with a documented complaint of \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  discrimination by a rider, Uber is required to verify corresponding data and assign a unique \nN\n19  number identifier to the allegedly offending driver.  See id. § 6.B.2. \n20  NFIB is required to create a “compliance testing program” that uses blind testers \n21  with guide dogs using Uber’s UberX service to test compliance.  Id. § 6.C.  Uber agreed to \n22  pay NFIB $225,000 “to support the testing program.”  Id. § 11.A.  If the Settlement is \n23  extended, Uber is required to pay NFIB an additional $75,000 to support the program.  See \n24  id. §§ 7, 11.A. \n25  The Settlement also requires an appointment of a third-party Monitor.  See id. § 8.  \n26  Annually, the Monitor is obligated to “review and analyze” all data collected and reported \n27 \n                                              \n1 All page numbers reference the page numbers automatically generated by ECF unless \n28 \notherwise indicated. \n  2 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 3 of 17\n \n1  by Uber pursuant to Section 6 of the Settlement, in addition to “any other information \n2  provided to the Monitor by the Parties.”  Id.  The Monitor then reports to the Parties \n3  whether Uber substantially complied with the Settlement during the preceding year.  Id.  \n4  The Monitor is also required to “propose . . . further modifications to Uber’s policies, \n5  practices, and procedures” if such policies, practices, or procedures were insufficient to \n6  address discrimination.  Id. \n7  Lastly, the Settlement permits Plaintiffs to seek attorneys’ fees and costs incurred \n8  up through the effective date of the Settlement.  Id. § 11.C.  Uber agreed “not to dispute \n9  the entitlement to reasonable Attorneys’ Fees incurred up through the Effective Date of \n10  [the] Agreement[,]” but reserved the right to dispute the amount of fees requested.  Id.  For \n11  fees and costs related to “work performed after the time the Settlement Agreement is \na  12  signed by all Parties, including for work spent on compliance monitoring, enforcement, \ntr in\nur\noo 13  and/or work spent securing their fees[,]” Plaintiffs reserved their rights to pursue such fees, \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  but the Settlement acknowledged that “all issues pertaining to any such attorneys’ fees, \nrts fo\niD tc 15  costs, and expenses are unresolved . . . .”  Id. § 11.C.1.  The Parties are required to confer \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and negotiate as to any fees and costs related to Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s monitoring efforts \nS \n n\ndr 17  before petitioning the Court.  Id. § 11.C.2. \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  The Court retained jurisdiction.  See id. § 12; see also Dkt. No. 145. \nN\n19  III.  Discussion \n20  A.  Entitlement to Fees \nThe parties first dispute whether Plaintiffs are entitled to fees.  See Dkt. No. 187 at \n21 \n11.  According to Uber, the Settlement did not authorize attorneys’ fees for monitoring \n22 \nwork and the ADA’s fee-shifting statute does not allow such fees.  Id.  The Court \n23 \ndisagrees. \n24 \nIn Prison Legal News v. Scharzenegger, 608 F.3d 446 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth \n25 \nCircuit reaffirmed that “a party that prevails by obtaining a consent decree may recover \n26 \nattorneys’ fees under [42 U.S.C.] § 1988 for monitoring compliance with the decree, even \n27 \nwhen such monitoring does not result in any judicially sanctioned relief.”  Prison Legal \n28 \n  3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 4 of 17\n \n1  News, 608 F.3d at 451 (citing Keith v. Volpe, 833 F.2d 850, 855–57 (9th Cir. 1987)).  \n2  Thus, plaintiffs may recover attorneys’ fees for monitoring compliance with a settlement \n3  agreement under § 1988.  Id. at 452; see also Balla v. Idaho, 677 F.3d 910, 916 (9th Cir. \n4  2012) (“[M]onitoring fees not resulting in additional relief are allowable . . . .”). \n5  Uber contends that Prison Legal News and its progeny are inapposite because those \n6  cases concern a different fee shifting statute.  But § 1988 and the ADA’s fee-shifting \n7  statute, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, are virtually identical.  Compare 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (“the \n8  court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as \n9  part of the costs . . . .”) with 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (“the court or agency, in its discretion, may \n10  allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee, including litigation expenses, \n11  and costs . . . .”).  Uber has not identified any principled reason why the Court should \na  12  interpret the two statutes differently. \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Moreover, the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in Pennsylvania v. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546 (1986).  There, the court \nrts fo\niD tc 15  noted that the fee-shifting provisions of the Clean Air Act and § 1988 served “the common \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  purpose of . . . promot[ing] citizen enforcement of important federal policies,” such that \nS \n n\ndr 17  there was “no reason not to interpret both provisions governing attorney’s fees in the same \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  manner.”  Id. at 560.  The same is true of the ADA’s fee-shifting statute and § 1988.  See \nN\n19  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home v. W.V. Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, \n20  629–30 (2001) (“the . . . ADA fee-shifting prescriptions [were] modeled on 42 U.S.C. \n21  § 1988 unmodified . . . .”), superseded by statute on other grounds. \n22  Nor does the language of the Settlement foreclose attorneys’ fees for monitoring \n23  work.  Rather, the Settlement explicitly acknowledges that “all issues pertaining to” fees, \n24  costs, and expenses relating to “work performed after the time the Settlement Agreement is \n25  signed . . . including for work spent on compliance monitoring [and] enforcement” was an \n26  unresolved issue.  See Settlement § 11.C.1. \n27  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees \n28  incurred in connection with monitoring Uber’s compliance with the Settlement. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 5 of 17\n \n1  B.  Reasonableness of Fees \n2  Uber does not contest the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ claimed costs.  See Dkt. No. \n3  185 at 27 (requesting costs in the amount of $685.36).  Plaintiffs adequately documented \n4  those costs and they appear reasonable.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ \n5  requests for costs in the amount of $685.36. \n6  Uber also does not challenge Plaintiffs’ counsels’ claimed rates and the Court \n7  previously approved Plaintiffs’ counsels’ rates.  See Dkt. No. 144.  Although Plaintiffs’ \n8  counsels rates have increased, the increase is modest and the Court FINDS that Plaintiffs’ \n9  counsels’ rates remain reasonable.  Compare Dkt. No. 142 at 4 with Dkt. No. 185-1 at 21. \n10  Instead, Uber challenges five categories of Plaintiffs’ requested attorneys’ fees as \n11  unnecessary or unreasonable.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 14–22.  Uber also argues that Plaintiffs’ \na  12  fees should be further reduced due to vague time entries and block billing.  Id. at 22–24.  \ntr in\nur\noo 13  The Court will first address each category of contested fees, then turn to Uber’s objections.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  See Dkt. No. 185-1, Ex. G (summary of claimed fees). \nrts fo\niD tc 15  1.  Work Related to Conferring with Monitor \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  In this category, Plaintiffs claim fees for hours spent (1) analyzing Uber’s data \nS \n n\ndr 17  reports and (2) for work related to conferring with the Monitor about those reports.  See \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Dkt. No. 185-1 (“Galvan Decl.”) ¶¶ 42–43.  Uber concedes that the hours spent analyzing \nN\n19  Uber’s reports are compensable,2 but argues that the hours spent for work relating to \n20  conferring with the Monitor was unnecessary.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 15–16.  According to \n21  Uber, such work is not compensable because the Settlement limits Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n22  involvement with the Monitor’s review Uber’s data reports.  Id. at 15.  Specifically, Uber \n23  contends that the Settlement only contemplates review of its reports by Plaintiffs’ counsel \n24  and “formal analyses . . . or opining with or conferring with the Monitor about Uber’s data \n25  reports” is outside the scope of the Settlement.  Id. \n26  The Court disagrees.  While the Settlement explicitly requires Uber to provide \n27 \n                                              \n2 Uber argues that these hours should be reduced as they were block billed.  See Dkt. No. \n28 \n187 at 16.  The Court will address Plaintiffs’ block billing below. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 6 of 17\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ counsel with data reports for analysis (see Settlement §§ 6.A, 6.B.1), the \n2  Settlement does not limit Plaintiffs’ counsel’s involvement to that of a passive observer.  \n3  Rather, the Settlement requires the Monitor to consider “any other information provided,” \n4  suggesting by implication that Plaintiffs’ counsel are permitted to submit their own \n5  commentary on Uber’s data reports.  Id. § 8.  Accordingly, work conducted by Plaintiffs’ \n6  counsel relating to conferring with the Monitor is generally compensable. \n7  However, the fact that the Settlement permits Plaintiffs to supply their own \n8  commentary on Uber’s data reports to the Monitor is not a license to bill for wholly \n9  unnecessary work that is duplicative of Uber’s reports.  See Balla, 677 F.3d at 919 (“[T]he \n10  court [must] exercise discretion [to] assure that the case is not being milked by a monitor \n11  after the injunction has been obtained, for fees that are unreasonable in amount, for work \na  12  not reasonably performed to enforce the relief, or for work not directly related to enforcing \ntr in\nur\noo 13  the relief.”).  It is unclear, for example, why Plaintiffs need to draft, review, and submit \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  declarations from individual complaining class members, particularly when there is no \nrts fo\niD tc 15  indication that Plaintiffs believe Uber’s internal data keeping was inaccurate.  See, e.g., \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Galvan Decl., Ex. F, pt.1 at 101 (billing over 6 hours at $400 per hour to review or draft \nS \n n\ndr 17  class member declarations), 113 (reviewing and drafting various class member \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  declarations).  Further, Plaintiffs’ billing records for this category of work contain several \nN\n19  vague time entries, some of which have questionable billing value.  See, e.g., id. at 147 \n20  (billing 0.8 hours at $275 per hour for “[m]aking a declaration, cover letter, and report \n21  accessible”).  Most of the hours, however, appear reasonable. \n22  Accordingly, the Court will reduce Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee for work relating to \n23  conferring with the Monitor by 10% in addition to Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% reduction.  The \n24  Court will not reduce Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee for analyzing Uber’s data beyond Plaintiffs’ \n25  voluntary 5% reduction.  Thus, Plaintiffs are entitled to $59,528.90 and $34,143.95 for \n26  these two sub-categories of work, respectively. \n27  2.  Work Related to Communicating with Class Members \n28  This category contains three sub-categories of work: (1) communicating with class \n  6 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 7 of 17\n \n1  members to address and respond to discrimination complaints; (2) submitting information \n2  requests to Uber pursuant to the Settlement’s process (see Settlement § 6.B.2); and (3) \n3  following up with class members who participated in NFIB’s compliance testing program \n4  (see id. § 6.C).  Uber concedes that the second sub-category of work is compensable but \n5  argues that the first and third sub-categories are not.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 16. \n6  As to the first sub-category of work—communicating with class members to \n7  address and respond to discrimination complaints—Uber is correct that Plaintiffs should \n8  not be compensated to the extent they are merely creating a parallel complaint \n9  investigations process.  The Settlement itself already creates a procedure for class \n10  members to raise discrimination complaints—a procedure hailed by Plaintiffs as a \n11  significant boon for the class.  See Dkt. No. 84. \na  12  This does not mean, however, that Plaintiffs’ counsel is required to sit on their \ntr in\nur\noo 13  hands and rubber-stamp Uber’s efforts.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s obligations to the class \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  requires them to take an active role in ensuring that the Settlement is working as intended.  \nrts fo\niD tc 15  And communicating with class members regarding Uber’s behavior is the core of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  monitoring efforts.  In Prison Legal News, for example, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \nS \n n\ndr 17  attorneys’ fees for “reviewing and responding to letters from [class members] complaining \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  about” the defendants’ failure to comply with the settlement.  Prison Legal News, 608 F.3d \nN\n19  at 453.  The Ninth Circuit noted that “[w]ithout such correspondence [with class \n20  members], it would be difficult for [plaintiffs] to discover or document violations of the \n21  terms of the settlement.”  Id. \n22  Upon review of Plaintiffs’ records, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs’ \n23  communication with class members regarding their discrimination complaints is limited to \n24  compiling information relating to their monitoring efforts and does not create a parallel \n25  track for investigating complaints. \n26  As to the third sub-category of work—communications with class members who \n27  participated in NFIB’s compliance testing program—the Court agrees with Uber.  \n28  Plaintiffs have already been compensated for work related to NFIB’s compliance testing \n  7 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 8 of 17\n \n1  program.  Section 11.A of the Settlement requires Uber to pay NFIB $225,000 “to support \n2  the testing program.”  Such payments naturally encompass fees and costs incurred in \n3  reviewing program data or following up with program participants.  Plaintiffs may not \n4  double-dip for the compliance testing program.  Disallowed amounts are listed in the chart \n5  below.3  Although some of these entries were coded by Plaintiffs as “Settlement \n6  Modifications” work, the Court compiles all disallowed NFIB-related hours here: \n7  Page \nDate of  Claimed  Claimed \n8  Entry Description  Number of \nEntry  Time  Amount \n9  Entry \n10  Prepare final language for message \n11  to intakes and NFB testing  2/2/2018  0.40  $216  5 \na  12  participants who reported denials \ntr in\nur\noo 13 \nCfi Analysis of NFB testing ride data  2/23/2018  1.10  $385  17 \n tla\nciC 14 \nrts fo Phone call with T Elder re NFB \niD tc 15  4/2/2018  0.70  $329  26 \n sir testing and follow up re same \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS  Reviewing Uber NFB testing data  4/2/2018  1.30  $611  26 \n n\ndr 17 \nee\nth\nintr Phone call with T Elder and M \nUo 18 \nN\nNunez regarding additional \n19 \n9/14/2018  1.00  $470  75 \ninformation sharing, NFB testing, \n20 \nand next steps \n21 \nDiscussing internal next steps with \n22 \nS Seaborn regarding information  9/14/2018  1.00  $470  75 \n23 \nsharing and NFB testing \n24 \n25  Case strategy re NFB testing  9/28/2018  0.10  $47  78 \n26 \n                                              \n27 \n3 Entries are drawn from Galvan Decl., Ex.

This amounts to $66,357.50. \ntatsiD 16 \nS  n 3.  Work Relating to Unwarranted or Abandoned Modifications \ndr 17 \nee\nth\nintr In this category, Plaintiffs seek attorneys’ fees relating to their efforts to modify the \nUo 18 \nN\nSettlement in three ways: (1) policies relating to Uber’s UberPool service; (2) seeking \n19 \nquarterly data extension; and (3) requesting further data sharing provisions.  Plaintiffs also \n20 \nseek attorneys’ fees for work relating to their settlement modification efforts that were not \n21 \nspecifically allocated to a single sub-category.  See Dkt. No. 185 at 13–14; Dkt. No. 195 at \n22 \n4–5.  Uber concedes that the second sub-category of fees relating to quarterly data \n23 \nextensions are compensable.  See Dkt. No. 187 at 18, 20.  The first and third sub-category, \n24 \naccording to Uber, are not compensable because those proposals were unnecessary or not \n25 \naccepted.  Id. at 18–19.  Uber also argues that Plaintiffs’ records documenting work \n26 \nrelating to unspecified settlement modification efforts is too vague and may hide double-\n27 \nbilling.  See Dkt. No. 200 at 5–6. \n28 \n  10 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 11 of 17\n \n1  First, the Court rejects Uber’s argument that those hours are not compensable \n2  because the Settlement has been effective.  Disallowing monitoring fees because Plaintiffs \n3  were successful in negotiating and crafting a successful settlement would be counter-\n4  productive.  Monitoring fees are permissible so long as they are not unreasonable and are \n5  related to enforcing the settlement.  See Balla, 677 F.3d at 919. \n6  Second, Uber concedes that Plaintiffs’ proposed modifications to its UberPool \n7  program and the data sharing provisions of the Settlement have been adopted “in a very \n8  limited fashion voluntarily by Uber.”  Dkt. No. 187 at 19.  But Plaintiffs are not required to \n9  achieve complete victory nor were they required to obtain a court order or official \n10  modification to be entitled to fees.  In Balla, Ninth Circuit affirmed modification fees even \n11  though the plaintiffs’ motion to hold the defendant in contempt was denied because \na  12  plaintiffs’ motion practice “played a key role in resolving” the underlying issue.  Balla, \ntr in\nur\noo 13  677 F.3d at 920 (quotations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit noted that “[i]f in a battle to take a \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  hill, the adversary flees instead of fighting to a bloody defeat, the taking of the hill makes \nrts fo\niD tc 15  the battle a victory.”  Id. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Here, although they may not have achieved wholesale adoption of these proposals, \nS \n n\ndr 17  Plaintiffs achieved at least some success as to their UberPool, quarterly data extension, and \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  further data sharing proposals.  Plaintiffs seek fees connected to those proposals.  After \nN\n19  reviewing Plaintiffs’ records, the billed amounts appear reasonable.  Less Plaintiffs’ \n20  voluntary 5% reduction, Plaintiffs are entitled to $29,324.61 for work related to these three \n21  sub-categories.4 \n22  As to Plaintiffs’ requested fees for unspecified settlement modification work, the \n23  Court shares Uber’s concern that counsels’ records are vague.  While the Court is not \n24  persuaded that Plaintiffs’ counsel double-billed for unspecified settlement modification \n25  work related to the three sub-categories discussed in this order, the parties’ submissions \n26 \n                                              \n27 \n4 As mentioned in footnote 3, supra, some entries block billed NFIB-testing-program-\nrelated work and UberPool work.  Because the Court already eliminated those fees—$801 \n28 \nin total—it does not do so again here. \n  11 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 12 of 17\n \n1  make clear that Plaintiffs’ counsel spent time working on settlement modification \n2  proposals that ultimately went nowhere.  See Galvan Decl. ¶¶ 45–47; Dkt. No. 187-1 \n3  (“Spurchise Decl.”), Ex. 2.  In particular, Plaintiffs proposed modifications to the \n4  Settlement’s education provisions in addition to the three sub-categories already discussed.  \n5  See Spurchise Decl., Ex. 2 at 4.  Because it is not clear that the wholly abandoned \n6  education proposal played any role in their overarching settlement modification efforts, \n7  hours expended relating to that proposal is not compensable.  Cf. Balla, 677 F.3d at 920 \n8  (fees expended on efforts that “play[] a key role” are compensable). \n9  Accordingly, the Court will reduce Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee for work relating to \n10  unspecified settlement modification work by 20% in addition to Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% \n11  reduction.  This amounts to $44,689.90 in fees for unspecified settlement modification \na  12  work.  In total, Plaintiffs are entitled to $74,014.51 for work relating to their settlement \ntr in\nur\noo 13  modification efforts. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  4.  Other Direct Monitoring Work \nrts fo\niD tc 15  This category of work includes (1) responding to inquiries from the United States \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Department of Justice regarding the Settlement; (2) investigating Uber’s filings with the \nS \n n\ndr 17  California Public Utilities Commission, arbitrations of service animal issues, and other \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  similar developments; (3) corresponding with Uber to verify compliance with Settlement \nN\n19  requirements; and (4) conferring with a consultant regarding evaluating the efficacy of the \n20  Settlement at reducing discrimination against class members. \n21  Here, Uber simply argues that this work is not compensable because these tasks \n22  were “[too] attenuated” from the Settlement.  Dkt. No. 185 at 21.  The Court is not \n23  convinced.  Corresponding with and investigating actions taken by regulatory bodies \n24  responsible for discrimination complaints is well within the scope of monitoring \n25  compliance with a discrimination-related settlement.  Likewise, Plaintiffs are entitled to \n26  reasonable consultant fees to evaluate whether the Settlement is working as intended. \n27  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees for their direct monitoring \n28  work less their voluntary 5% reduction in fees.  This amounts to $13,130.90. \n  12 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 13 of 17\n \n1  5.  Fees Relating to Plaintiffs’ Unfiled Attorneys’ Fee Motion \n2  The next category of fees relates to work expended by Plaintiffs’ counsel on an \n3  unfiled fees motion.  In March 2018, the parties began negotiating Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n4  attorneys’ fees for work conducted in 2017.  See Galvan Decl. ¶¶ 64–70; Spurchise Decl. \n5  ¶¶ 4–5.  Under the Settlement, the parties are required to negotiate such fees within 60 \n6  days before seeking Court intervention.  See Settlement § 11.C.2.  The parties initially \n7  failed to come to an agreement within the 60-day limit, but ultimately settled the dispute \n8  by July 2, 2018.  See Galvan Decl. ¶¶ 67–69; Spurchise Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.  The fees motion \n9  was thus never filed. \n10  Given the Settlement’s requirement that the parties negotiate their fees dispute, it \n11  was unreasonable for Plaintiffs to bill for hours preparing a fee motion prior to April 30, \na  12  2018—the end of the 60-day negotiation period.  Once it became clear that no settlement \ntr in\nur\noo 13  was forthcoming, however, Plaintiffs were entitled to begin preparing their fees motion \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  and are entitled to fees for time spent accordingly.  Thus, the Court disallows all fees billed \nrts fo\niD tc 15  prior to April 30, 2018, less Plaintiffs’ voluntary 5% reduction.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  entitled to $4,393.75 in fees and costs for their unfiled fees motion.  See Galvan Decl., Ex. \nS \n n\ndr 17  F, pt. 2 at 7–12. \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  6.  Fees Relating to This Fees Motion \nN\n19  Finally, Plaintiffs request fees for preparing the instant fees motion.  Plaintiffs \n20  request $64,019.25 for hours worked from May 14, 2019—the last day of the parties’ \n21  negotiation period—to August 25, 2019.  See Dkt. No. 190 at 20.  After being given an \n22  opportunity to respond, Uber did not oppose Plaintiffs’ request for fees relating to the \n23  instant fees motion.  See Dkt. Nos. 199, 200. \n24  Reviewing Plaintiffs’ records (see Dkt. No. 190-1 at 24–29), the requested hours are \n25  well documented and appear reasonable.  Accordingly, after accounting for Plaintiffs’ \n26  voluntary reductions, Plaintiffs are entitled to $64,019.25 in fees relating to this fees \n27  motion. \n28  / / / \n  13 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 14 of 17\n \n1  7.  Specific Challenges to Hours \n2  Uber challenges 13.2 hours as unduly vague and an additional 137.7 hours for \n3  impermissible block billing.5  The Court first addresses Uber’s vagueness challenges \n4  before turning to the alleged block-billed hours. \n5  When submitting entries for attorneys’ fee awards, attorneys are “not required to \n6  record in great detail how each minute of [their] time was expended.”  Hensley v. \n7  Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 n.12 (1983).  Attorneys need only “keep records in sufficient \n8  detail that a neutral judge can make a fair evaluation of the time expended, the nature and \n9  need for the service, and the reasonable fees to be allowed.”  Id. at 441 (Burger, C.J., \n10  concurring); United Steelworkers of Am. v. Ret. Income Plan For Hourly-Rated Employees \n11  of ASARCO, Inc., 512 F.3d 555, 565 (9th Cir. 2008). \na  12  The Court reviewed the entries Uber identified as vague.  See Dkt. No. 187-6.  It \ntr in\nur\noo 13  agrees as to the following entries: \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Date of  Claimed  Claimed \nrts fo Entry Description \niD tc 15  Entry  Time  Amount \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Team phone call  1/8/2018  1.60  $752 \nS \n n\ndr 17 \nee Correspondence regarding \nth\nintr 1/17/2018  0.10  $47 \nUo 18 \nN proposed changes to settlement \n19 \nPhone call with D.

See Spurchise Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. \n3.  Uber’s opposition, however, does not challenge those hours.  And, in any case, review \n28 \nof those entries does not suggest that they are duplicative or clerical. \n  14 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 15 of 17\n \n1  Drafting declaration and gathering \n6/5/2018  1.60  $752 \n2  exhibits \n3  Discuss next steps with team  10/11/2018  0.30  $105 \n4 \nPreparing for team call  10/18/2018  0.30  $141 \n5 \nMake stipulation accessible at the \n12/18/2018  0.20  $55 \n6 \nrequest of M.

Inc., \n21 \n214 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 2000). \n22 \nHere, the Court finds that the alleged block-billed entries “contain enough \n23 \nspecificity as to individual tasks to ascertain whether the amount of time spent performing \n24 \nthem was reasonable.”  Garcia, 2012 WL 3778852, at *8.  Because the block-billed entries \n25 \nare adequately detailed to permit the Court to assess the reasonableness of hours expended, \n26 \nthe Court finds that plaintiffs’ counsel have sufficiently documented their hours; no \n27 \nreduction is necessary on this basis. \n28 \n  15 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 203   Filed 11/08/19   Page 16 of 17\n \n1  C.  Motion to Seal \n2  Plaintiffs move to seal two exhibits containing a chart and graph detailing the \n3  number of service-animal-related complaints received by Uber on a month-to-month basis.  \n4  See Dkt. No. 189-5.  Plaintiffs also seek to redact two portions of their reply referencing \n5  that information.  See Dkt. No. 189-4 at 13.  Notably, the information sought to be sealed \n6  are merely information derived from Uber’s data reports, not the reports themselves. \n7  Local Rule 79-5(e)(1) requires the party designating a document as confidential to \n8  “file a declaration as required by [Local Rule] 79-5(d)(1)(A) establishing that all of the \n9  designated material is sealable” within four days of the filing of the motion to seal.  Local \n10  Rule 79-5(d)(1)(A) further explains that merely “[r]eferenc[ing] a stipulation or protective \n11  order that allows a party to designate certain documents as confidential is not sufficient to \na  12  establish that a document, or portions thereof, are sealable.”  See also Kamakana v. City & \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Cty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2006) (listing grounds establishing \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  “compelling reasons” to seal court files). \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs filed their motion to seal and served their motion on Uber on August 30, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2019.  See Dkt. Nos. 189, 191.  Because more than four days have passed since Plaintiffs \nS \n n\ndr 17  filed their motion and Uber has not filed a declaration explaining why the derived \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  information contained in the exhibits or the reply is confidential, the Court DENIES the \nN\n19  administrative motion to seal without prejudice.  Plaintiffs must file the documents in the \n20  public record by October 11, 2019.  See N.D. Cal. Local Rule 79-5(e)(2). \n21  IV.

Plaintiffs are \n23  entitled to $312,763.76 in attorneys’ fees and $685.36 in costs for a total award of \n24  $313,449.12.

APPROVAL AND ATTORNEYS’ \nur FEES \nCoifo 13   \nt al UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,  Re: Dkt. Nos. 119, 128 \ncC\ni 14 \nstrof  Defendant. \nDict  15       \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  In September 2014, the National Federation of the Blind of California and three \nS \n n\ndr 17  individuals sued Uber and its California subsidiaries, alleging that Uber violates state and \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  federal law by discriminating against blind persons when Uber drivers refuse to transport \nN\n19  service dogs.  In April 2015, this Court denied Uber’s motion to dismiss the complaint and \n20  found that NFB-CA had associational standing and that Uber is subject to the ADA.  The \n21  parties then began preparing for trial, while also engaging in settlement discussions.  \n22  In January 2016, the parties notified the Court that they had a settlement in \n23  principle, so the Court granted their request to vacate the deadlines in the case.  In late \n24  April 2016, the parties requested preliminary approval of their class action settlement.  The \n25  Court granted preliminary approval, and the parties now seek final approval of the \n26  settlement.  In addition, plaintiffs move for $1,589,574 in attorneys’ fees and $13,447.14 \n27  in costs, with a multiplier of 2.0.  Uber agrees that plaintiffs can recover attorneys’ fees, \n28  but disputes the reasonableness of the fees and costs.  The Court held a hearing on the \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                       \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 139   Filed 12/06/16   Page 2 of 4\n \n1  motions on December 1, 2016, and granted both the motion for final approval and the \n2  motion for attorneys’ fees.   \n3  As to the final approval of the settlement, the parties reported that no objections to \n4  the settlement were received.  In its order granting preliminary approval of the settlement, \n5  the Court summarized the settlement’s key components and analyzed the fairness of \n6  settlement in detail.  Dkt. No. 112.  The Court now concludes that the settlement is fair, \n7  adequate, and reasonable and GRANTS the motion for final approval of the class action \n8  settlement.  The Court retains jurisdiction over the settlement for the duration of the \n9  settlement agreement.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 378 \n10  (1994). \n11  As to the attorneys’ fees request, Uber does not dispute plaintiffs’ entitlement to \na  12  attorneys’ fees.  Thus, the Court considers (1) the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees, \nrt ni\nur\nCoifo 13  and (2) the appropriate multiplier.   \nt al\ncC\ni 14  Plaintiffs request $1,589,574 in attorneys’ fees.  The “lodestar is the product of \nstrof \nDict  15  reasonable hours times a reasonable rate.”  City of Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 559 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  (1992).  Uber objects to (1) the attorneys’ hourly rate; (2) duplicative work done by \nS \n n\ndr 17  multiple attorneys in attending hearings and conference calls, and (3) plaintiffs’ trial \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  preparation after settlement negotiations had begun.   \nN\n19  First, the Court finds that plaintiffs have cited sufficient authority that the rates \n20  requested have been awarded in this district and are considered reasonable in the San \n21  Francisco Bay Area market.   \n22  Second, the Court finds that plaintiffs’ counsel have not unnecessarily duplicated \n23  work by structuring their team to have multiple attorneys consulted at key times in the \n24  case.  See Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind v. Target Corp., No. 06-cv-01802 MHP, 2009 WL \n25  2390261, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2009) (“the court may not condition fees on plaintiffs’ \n26  counsel’s conformance to the typical commercial law firm’s pyramidal staffing \n27  structure.”).   \n28  Third, the parties moved to vacate trial deadlines in January, and the Court made \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      2 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 139   Filed 12/06/16   Page 3 of 4\n \n1  clear for the following four months that trial dates would be reinstated if a settlement was \n2  not promptly entered.  Under those circumstances, the Court finds it reasonable that \n3  plaintiffs’ counsel continued to prepare for trial after January and even until April when a \n4  final settlement was entered on the docket.  Considering all arguments, the Court \n5  concludes that plaintiffs’ request for fees and costs are reasonable and GRANTS the \n6  motion. \n7  In addition to reasonable attorneys’ fees, plaintiffs request a multiplier of 2.0 under \n8  California law.  A multiplier is permitted under California law to allow plaintiffs to be \n9  compensated for the real market value of their work, which includes a certain amount of \n10  risk absorbed by counsel when working on contingency.  See Ketchum v. Moses, 24 Cal. \n11  4th 1122, 1136 (2001) (“The experience of the marketplace indicates that lawyers \na  12  generally will not provide legal representation on a contingent basis unless they receive a \nrt ni\nur\nCoifo 13  premium for taking that risk.”). \nt al\ncC\ni 14  The Court considers the most analogous case cited by the parties: Nat’l Fed’n of the \nstrof \nDict  15  Blind v. Target Corp., No. 06-cv-01802 MHP, 2009 WL 2390261 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  2009).  In Target, plaintiffs sought to make Target’s online platform accessible to blind \nS \n n\ndr 17  web users.  Id. at *1.  There, Judge Patel found that a 1.65 multiplier was appropriate in a \nee\nth\nnirt\nUo 18  case with significant motion practice, including contested motions to dismiss, for \nN\n19  preliminary injunction, class certification, and summary judgment.  Id. at *9.   \n20  In this case, the Court finds that plaintiffs’ sought to enhance Uber’s policies to \n21  protect blind riders, which can provide a model for other businesses in the sharing \n22  economy.  Additionally, plaintiffs faced a significant hurdle in overcoming the motion to \n23  dismiss, and took on the risk associated with raising novel legal issues in complex areas of \n24  jurisdictional, employment, and discrimination law.  Thus, the Court finds that here, a \n25  multiplier of 1.5 is appropriate to fully award plaintiffs for the fair market value of their \n26  work in taking on this case.    \n27  Plaintiffs must submit an updated proposed order as to the requested fees and costs \n28  for the Court’s signature in accordance with this order by December 12, 2016.   \nCase No. 14-cv-04086 NC                      3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 139   Filed 12/06/16   Page 4 of 4\n \n1   \n2  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n3   \n4  Dated:  December 6, 2016  _____________________________________ \nNATHANAEL M.

Enhanced Dissemination of Information to Drivers \n13  A.  New Drivers \n14  1.  Uber agrees that Drivers, before they are given access to the Driver \n15  App, must expressly acknowledge that they have read and understood \n16  Uber’s Service Animal Policy (as outlined in Section 5.A, below), \n17  which document shall state that Drivers have a legal obligation to \n18  provide  service  to  Riders  with  Service  Animals  anywhere  in  the \n19  United States with no exceptions, including but not limited  to for \n20  reasons related to allergies or religious objections.   \n21  2.  Uber agrees to add an interactive pop-up notification prompt in the \n22  Driver App that verifies all newly-registered Drivers, anywhere in the \n23  United States, are aware of Uber’s Service Animal Policy and are \n24  willing  and  able  to  transport  Riders  with  Service  Animals.    The \n25  prompt  will  first  appear  in  the  Driver  App  for  every  new  Driver \n26  within two weeks after the Driver accepts the Licensing Agreement.  \n27  New Drivers will be blocked from using the Driver App until they \n28  complete  the  interactions  required  by  the  pop-up  notification  and \n      6  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 9 of 56\n1  confirm their agreement to transport Riders with Service Animals.  \n2  The exact content of the prompt and description of the interactive \n3  nature of the pop-up notification is contained in Addendum 1 to this \n4  Agreement.   \n5  3.  Uber agrees to add the following statement, along with a link to the \n6  Service Animal Policy, on the “background” tab page of its Driver \n7  sign-up flow: “You understand that, in order to access the Uber app, \n8  you will be obligated to transport passengers with Service Animals in \n9  accordance with applicable federal, state and local law and Uber’s \n10  Service Animal Policy [insert link].” \n11  4.  Uber will amend the practices applicable to Drivers as described in \n12  this section 4.A above within 30 days of the Effective Date. \n13  B.  Active Drivers \n14  1.  Within 30 days after the Effective Date, Uber will push the interactive \n15  pop-up notification prompt referred to in section 4.A.2 above and \n16  described in Addendum 1 to all valid, registered Driver App accounts \n17  regardless of app version or mobile device platform.  No Driver will \n18  be able to access the Driver App until the Driver completes the \n19  interactions prompted by the pop-up notification and agrees to \n20  transport Riders with Service Animals. \n21  2.  During the Agreement Term, Uber will send quarterly email \n22  reminders to all Drivers with active accounts reminding Drivers of \n23  their obligation to accept Riders with Service Animals.  The emails \n24  shall contain photographs of blind individuals with guide dogs to \n25  remind Drivers of how to readily identify Service Animals. \n26  3.  Uber agrees to and has added detailed language to its Driver \n27  Licensing Agreement that expressly explains that Drivers have an \n28  obligation to transport Riders with Service Animals under the \n      7  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 10 of 56\n1  Americans with Disabilities Act with no exception for allergies or \n2  religious objections.  The Licensing Agreement also expressly states \n3  that any Drivers who refuse to transport Riders with Service Animals \n4  in violation of this obligation consent to the permanent restriction of \n5  their Driver App account and the permanent termination of their \n6  contractual relationship with Uber if, based on the evidence, it is \n7  reasonable for Uber to conclude the Driver knowingly refused service \n8  to a Rider with a Service Animal, or if Uber receives plausible reports \n9  from Riders of more than one cancellation or refusal by such Driver \n10  alleged to be on the basis of the presence of a Rider’s Service Animal. \n11  4.  Uber agrees that, consistent with its current cleaning fee policy, \n12  Riders will only be charged, if at all, upon a third instance of a \n13  reported mess involving a Rider’s Service Animal’s bodily fluids.  If a \n14  Rider contests that a Service Animal created such a mess, Uber shall \n15  undertake a reasonable good faith effort to determine whether such a \n16  mess actually occurred.  Riders will not be charged for any instance of \n17  reported shedding of dog hair. These policies regarding cleaning fees \n18  shall be disseminated to all customer support staff and shall be \n19  incorporated into the Service Animal Policy.  \n20  5.  Uber agrees to provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel drafts of the quarterly \n21  emails and amended Driver Licensing Agreement at least 15 days \n22  before issuance, and shall consider any comments or proposed \n23  revisions from Plaintiffs’ Counsel on these draft documents in good \n24  faith.  Uber will send Plaintiffs’ Counsel a copy of the finalized \n25  quarterly emails and amended Driver Licensing Agreement within 10 \n26  days after issuance. \n27  6.  Uber agrees to implement the changes described in this Section 4.B \n28  within 30 days of the Effective Date unless this timeline is otherwise \n      8  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 11 of 56\n1  prohibited by an applicable court order. \n2  5.  Changes to Licensing Agreement Language and Enforcement Practices \n3  Related To Nondiscrimination \n4  A.  Driver Contract Termination \n5  1.  In conjunction with the issuance of an updated Licensing Agreement, \n6  Uber agrees to implement an enforcement practice pursuant to which \n7  Uber shall have the right to, and shall, permanently terminate its \n8  contractual relationship with a Driver and the Driver’s access to the \n9  Driver App if Uber discovers that a Driver knowingly refused to \n10  transport a Rider with a Service Animal because of that Service \n11  Animal anywhere in the United States.  All such instances shall be \n12  specifically identified as a material breach of the Licensing \n13  Agreement by the Driver.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that, pursuant to the \n14  Licensing Agreement, a Driver may have the opportunity to have any \n15  contract termination reviewed by a neutral arbitrator, and that Uber \n16  may be bound by any decision of that arbitrator.  Should any Driver \n17  seek to challenge the termination by an arbitration petition, Uber will \n18  notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel of such, provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with \n19  copies of the material submitted to the arbitrator, provide Plaintiffs’ \n20  Counsel with an opportunity to provide a submission to such \n21  arbitrator, and inform Plaintiffs’ Counsel of the outcome.  Uber shall \n22  not be responsible for paying Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s fees for time spent \n23  reviewing materials submitted to an arbitrator or preparing Plaintiffs’ \n24  Counsel’s submission to an arbitrator pursuant to this paragraph in \n25  connection with any Driver contract termination arbitration \n26  proceedings. \n27  2.  Uber will review whether the Driver knowingly refused service to a \n28  Rider with a Service Animal because of that Service Animal for every \n      9  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 12 of 56\n1  report that Uber receives from Riders of such denial.   \n2  3.  Uber agrees to produce an internal guidance document for customer \n3  support staff and train such staff on how to reliably identify situations \n4  where a Driver has knowingly refused to transport a Rider with a \n5  Service Animal because of that Service Animal in violation of the \n6  Licensing Agreement.  This document will contain a non-exhaustive \n7  list of the most common situations in which a contract termination \n8  should occur.  A copy of this internal document is attached to this \n9  Agreement as Addendum 2. \n10  4.  The revised Licensing Agreement also contains express language \n11  pursuant to which Uber shall have the right to, and shall, permanently \n12  terminate its contractual relationship with a Driver and the Driver’s \n13  access to the Driver App if Uber receives plausible complaints from \n14  Riders on more than one occasion that a particular Driver refused to \n15  transport a Rider with a Service Animal because of that Service \n16  Animal anywhere in the United States, without regard to the intent or \n17  knowledge of the Driver.  Uber will rigorously enforce this \n18  contractual provision. \n19  B.  Complaint Processing Procedures \n20  1.  Within 30 days after the Effective date, Uber will ensure that Riders \n21  can more easily report denials of rides through the Rider App.  From \n22  the “Trip Details” screen reflecting the last trip completed or \n23  cancelled, the Rider will have the ability to open a Service Animal \n24  complaint submission screen in the Rider App by navigating through \n25  no more than two linked screens or display interactions.  There shall \n26  be an Accessible control on the screen reflecting the trip cancellation \n27  entitled “Need Help?”, which will link to a screen with a prominently-\n28  located option labeled “I want to report a service animal issue.”  This \n      10  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 13 of 56\n1  control shall open an Accessible form which permits the Rider to \n2  enter and submit a narrative description in an edit field and to report \n3  what occurred with the Driver.  At all times, a Rider shall have the \n4  ability to navigate from the “Menu” screen to the Service Animal \n5  complaint submission screen by navigating through no more than \n6  three linked screens or display interactions.  The button to reach the \n7  service animal complaint submission screen shall be labeled “I want \n8  to report a service animal issue” and will be prominently located. \n9  Once the Rider submits a complaint of Service Animal discrimination, \n10  the complaint will be forwarded to the internal Access Complaint \n11  Team at Uber that handles accessibility issues or escalated complaints \n12  from general customer support.  The process for accessing the form \n13  and further details regarding the complaint submission form, are \n14  contained in Addendum 3 to this Agreement.  \n15  2.  Within 30 days after the Effective Date, Uber will add an Accessible \n16  link that may be accessed from the home page of its website labeled “I \n17  want to report a service animal issue.” that links to an Accessible \n18  complaint form.  This link shall open an Accessible form which \n19  permits the Rider to submit a narrative description and quickly select \n20  a predetermined option to report what occurred with the Driver (see \n21  Addendum 3).    Once submitted, the report will be automatically \n22  forwarded to the Access Complaint Team for investigation and \n23  response.   There will be a link to Uber’s Service Animal Policy \n24  accessible from the home page as well.  Uber agrees to maintain the \n25  Access Complaint Team for the duration of the Agreement Term.  \n26  The process for accessing the form and further details regarding the \n27  complaint submission form, are contained in Addendum 3 to this \n28  Agreement.  \n      11  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 14 of 56\n1  3.  Within 30 days after the Effective Date, Uber will train all customer \n2  service and support staff on how to process and respond to reports that \n3  a Driver refused service to a Rider with a Service Animal in the \n4  United States.  All such reports shall be forwarded to the Access \n5  Complaint Team for review and response.  Uber will inform the Rider \n6  promptly after submission of a complaint that the complaint has been \n7  received and is being reviewed.  If Uber has an email address \n8  associated with the Rider the response will be sent to this email \n9  address.  Uber will endeavor in good faith to complete its review of \n10  each complaint within one week of the complaint submission and \n11  notify the Rider about the outcome, including the following: whether \n12  Uber has terminated its contractual relationship with the Driver at \n13  issue or, if not, whether Uber will terminate this contractual \n14  relationship with the Driver at issue if a second plausible Service \n15  Animal complaint is submitted concerning the Driver. \n16  4.  Uber will reverse any trip cancellation charges or otherwise reimburse \n17  any charges imposed where the Rider submits a complaint that the \n18  Driver denied service due to the presence of a Service Animal. \n19  5.  The two methods for reporting to Uber complaints concerning \n20  discrimination against Riders with Service Animals described in \n21  paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section and the policy on reversing \n22  improper trip cancellation charges described in paragraph 4 of this \n23  section above shall be included in the Service Animal Policy, and \n24  marketed to the disability community nationwide along with a guide \n25  no more than three pages long that details the steps to submit a \n26  complaint using the Rider App or Uber’s website and where to find \n27  Uber’s Service Animal Policy. \n28  6.  Uber will provide a Rider an account credit of $25 for each instance in \n      12  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 15 of 56\n1  which a Driver’s contractual relationship is terminated as the result of \n2  a report that the Driver refused to transport the Rider anywhere in the \n3  United States because of a Service Animal. \n4  7.  Uber will not automatically block future trip pairing between Riders \n5  and Drivers as a result of a Rider submitting a complaint to Uber \n6  about a Service Animal denial of service.  However, Uber may block \n7  future trip pairing between a specific Driver and Rider if a Rider \n8  expressly requests that result. \n9  6.  Compliance Record-Keeping and Testing \n10  A.

Data Reporting \n23  1.  Uber shall report the raw data in Section 6.A to Plaintiffs’ Counsel \n24  without disclosing the name or email address of the Driver or the \n25  Rider involved.  Starting on the Effective Date, this reporting will \n26  occur quarterly for the first year of the Term, biannually for the \n27  second year of the Term and annually for the remainder of the Term.  \n28  However, Uber shall resume reporting the data to Plaintiffs’ Counsel \n      14  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 17 of 56\n1  on a quarterly basis if any of the following occurs: \n2  (a)  The reported data shows more than a 7.5% increase in the \n3  number of reported instances where a Driver refused to \n4  transport a Rider with a Service Animal during the reporting \n5  period as compared with the prior period; \n6  (b)  In resolving a dispute pursuant to Section 10 of this \n7  Agreement, the magistrate judge concludes that Uber has not \n8  complied with a provision of this Agreement. \n9  (c)  The Parties agree or the Monitor determines that there has not \n10  been substantial compliance by Uber with the terms of the \n11  Agreement during the prior reporting period. \n12  2.  With the exception of the Driver’s name, Uber shall verify all the \n13  other corresponding data described in Section 6.A as to any Rider \n14  Uber account with respect to which Plaintiffs’ Counsel provides Uber \n15  with (a) a documented complaint by the Rider of alleged \n16  discrimination; (b) the email address for the Rider’s account and; (c) \n17  proof that the Rider consented to disclosure of that data for the \n18  purposes of testing compliance with this Agreement.  With regards to \n19  the Driver’s name, Uber shall assign a unique number identifier for \n20  each such Driver in the reporting so that Plaintiffs’ Counsel can \n21  determine if a particular Driver was involved in multiple instances of \n22  alleged discrimination and/or their contract was terminated.  Items (a) \n23  -  (c) above can be satisfied by either of the following:   \n24  (i)  An email from the Rider confirming such a complaint \n25  was submitted and agreeing to disclosure of the data. \n26  (ii)  A document signed by hand or electronically by the \n27  Rider confirming such a complaint was submitted and \n28  agreeing to disclosure of the data. \n      15  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 18 of 56\n1  3.  Uber shall produce the data in an .xls file, .xlsx file, .csv file, or other \n2  common database format that can be read by Microsoft Excel while \n3  retaining column, row, heading and other organizational information.  \n4  The format shall enable Plaintiffs’ Counsel to easily determine the \n5  sum total number of contracts terminated and total number of reports \n6  that a particular Driver refused to transport a Rider with a Service \n7  Animal or otherwise discriminated against a Rider with a Service \n8  Animal due to the presence of that Service Animal.  \n9  4.  Notwithstanding the above, the Monitor shall be permitted to review \n10  Driver names and account details necessary if there is reason to \n11  believe a Driver (a) has not had his/her contractual relationship \n12  terminated in accordance with the Driver’s Licensing Agreement and \n13  as described in this Agreement; or (b) has fraudulently resumed \n14  driving after having his/her contractual relationship with Uber \n15  terminated. \n16  C.  NFB Testing \n17  NFB National in coordination with NFBC shall administer a compliance \n18  testing program that uses blind individuals with guide dogs as testers to \n19  document trips using the uberX service in a sample of trip requests across the \n20  United States and California.  NFB will have complete discretion in \n21  administering the testing program, including, but not limited to, the \n22  frequency and location of tests, and reporting of test results.  Test results \n23  may not be shared publically and are subject to the terms of the Parties’ \n24  Stipulated Protective Order in this case.  NFB’s testing program shall be \n25  consistent with Uber’s ordinary provision of service and testers shall not \n26  disclose testing to Drivers or influence their typical operations.  In the event \n27  Uber believes the testing program is interfering with or undermining the \n28  Rider and Driver experience  or Uber’s business relationship with Drivers, \n      16  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 19 of 56\n1  and the Parties cannot come to an agreement regarding changes thereto, the \n2  Parties agree to resolve the dispute through the Dispute Resolution provision \n3  in Section 10. \n4  7.  Term of the Agreement \n5  A.  The term of this Agreement shall be three and one half (3.5) years from the \n6  Effective Date except as follows:  if the Parties agree or the Monitor determines that there \n7  has not been substantial compliance by Uber with the terms of the Agreement for years \n8  two and/or three, the term shall extend to five years from the Effective Date (hereafter the \n9  “Extended Agreement Term”).  Any disputes concerning substantial compliance shall be \n10  resolved through the dispute resolution process set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement.  \n11  8.  Further Modifications to Information, Enforcement, and Monitoring \n12  A.  The Parties recognize and agree that other relevant issues may arise during \n13  the term of this Agreement that were not anticipated when this Agreement was executed, \n14  and  that  data  that  Uber  provides  to  Plaintiffs’  Counsel  pursuant  to  Section  6  of  this \n15  Agreement  may  show  that  the  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  adopted  by  this \n16  Agreement have unintended consequences or are insufficient to comprehensively address \n17  discrimination because of Service Animals.  The Parties have agreed that a third-party \n18  monitor (“Monitor”) will review and analyze the data that Uber reports pursuant to Section \n19  6.B of this Agreement as well as any other information provided to the Monitor by the \n20  Parties.  Beginning twelve months after the Effective Date, if the Monitor’s analysis of this \n21  data  reveals  that  Uber’s practices,  policies,  and  procedures  are insufficient  to  address \n22  discrimination because of Service Animals, the Monitor shall propose to the Parties further \n23  modifications  to  Uber’s  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  to  improve  access  to \n24  transportation available through the Rider App.  The Monitor will report to the Parties \n25  within two months after the end of each year during the Agreement Term whether Uber \n26  has substantially complied with its obligations under the Agreement during the prior year, \n27  except that in the fifth year under an Extended Agreement Term, the Monitor shall base the \n28  Monitor’s assessment on the first 9 months of the fifth year and submit the Monitor’s final \n      17  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 20 of 56\n1  report to the Parties 30 days prior to the expiration of the Extended Agreement Term.  \n2  Uber will consider in good faith any requests by the Monitor for information or documents \n3  beyond those specified in Section 6 of this Agreement.  Either party may use the Dispute \n4  Resolution  procedure  set  forth  in  Section  10  of  this  Agreement  to  resolve  disputes \n5  concerning the Monitor including, but not limited to, disputes concerning the Monitor’s \n6  reports, recommendations or requests for documents and information. \n7  B.  The Parties agree that at any point after twelve months from the Effective \n8  Date of this Agreement, Plaintiffs may request, if there is good cause to believe there is \n9  need for further modifications to Uber’s policies and practices, that the Parties meet and \n10  confer to negotiate further modifications to Uber’s policies and practices, including the \n11  measures adopted in this Agreement, to more effectively address alleged Driver \n12  discrimination against Riders with Service Animals.  Within thirty days of Plaintiffs’ \n13  request under this paragraph, unless extended by agreement of the Parties or for good \n14  cause, the Parties shall meet and confer to negotiate such further modifications, if any, to \n15  Uber’s policies, practices, and procedures, including the measures adopted by this \n16  Agreement, but in no event will the modifications lessen the benefits or protections for \n17  members of the settlement class. \n18  C.  To the extent that the Parties reach agreement to further modify the policies, \n19  practices, and procedures set forth in this Agreement, the Parties agree that such agreement \n20  will be reduced to writing as a binding Memorandum of Understanding between the \n21  Parties.  The Parties agree that, unless the written agreement expressly states otherwise, \n22  disputes under any Memoranda of Understanding adopted will be resolved using the \n23  Dispute Resolution process set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement. \n24  D.  If the Parties are unable to reach agreement concerning additional measures \n25  within sixty days of first meeting and conferring, then the Parties shall resolve the dispute \n26  using the dispute resolution process set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement. \n27  E.  Selection and Compensation of Monitor \n28  1.  The Parties will attempt to jointly agree upon an individual to serve as \n      18  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 21 of 56\n1  the Monitor for the purposes of this part of the Agreement.  If the \n2  Parties cannot agree on a Monitor within sixty days of the Effective \n3  Date, each side shall present three candidates to the Magistrate Judge \n4  who retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes.  The Magistrate Judge \n5  shall then select the Monitor.  If this individual becomes unavailable, \n6  the parties shall meet and confer within thirty days to try to reach \n7  agreement on a replacement Monitor, and the same process described \n8  above to select the initial Monitor will be used to select the \n9  replacement Monitor.   \n10  2.  Compensation of Monitor. \n11  (a)  Uber shall pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the \n12  Monitor during the 3.5 year term of the Agreement up to \n13  $50,000.  If the term of this agreement is extended pursuant to \n14  Section 7, then Defendants shall pay the Monitor’s reasonable \n15  fees and costs for the Extended Agreement Term up to \n16  $35,000.  If Plaintiffs contend that additional compensation \n17  beyond the $50,000, or beyond $35,000 for the fourth and fifth \n18  years if applicable, is needed to reasonably compensate the \n19  monitor, the Parties shall meet and confer to attempt to \n20  negotiate an increase to the cap.  If the Parties are unable to \n21  agree upon a modification to the cap, the parties shall resolve \n22  the dispute pursuant to the Dispute Resolution provision set \n23  forth in Section 10 herein. \n24  (b)  Invoices will be provided to all Parties for their review before \n25  payment.  There will be a yearly budget negotiated with the \n26  monitor.  If the Monitor exceeds the budget for fees or costs \n27  without prior approval, he or she may be removed and \n28  replaced.  If the Parties do not agree on removal, either party \n      19  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 22 of 56\n1  may refer the matter to dispute resolution to determine whether \n2  the Monitor should be retained or removed. \n3  3.  All communications, including invoices, data, questions, information, \n4  documents, between the Monitor, Uber, Plaintiffs and counsel for the \n5  Parties, shall be copied to opposing counsel.  No ex parte \n6  communications shall be permitted.    \n7  9.  Scope of the Agreement \n8  A.  The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to Uber’s policies, practices, \n9  and procedures with respect to Riders with Service Animals nationwide within the United \n10  States.  The data that Uber periodically reports to Plaintiffs’ Counsel pursuant to Section 6 \n11  of this Agreement shall contain relevant information for Drivers and Riders with Service \n12  Animals nationwide within the United States.   \n13  B.  Plaintiffs expressly agree that the resolution described herein is fair and \n14  adequate, and that the policies and procedures set forth in this Agreement are intended to \n15  remedy any and all alleged violations of the ADA and related state and local laws by \n16  Defendants with respect to the claims alleged by Plaintiffs in this case. \n17  10.  Dispute Resolution \n18  A.  All disputes concerning compliance with this Agreement, enforcement of \n19  Uber’s Service Animal Policy, modifications to Uber’s policies and procedures pursuant to \n20  Section 8 of this Agreement, and Uber’s procedures for responding to complaints \n21  concerning discrimination against Riders with Service Animals, shall be resolved through \n22  a three-step process as follows: \n23  •  Step One:  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall send a letter to counsel for Uber \n24  concerning any dispute, and counsel for the Parties shall meet and confer in a \n25  good faith effort to resolve any dispute. \n26  •  Step Two:  In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve their dispute \n27  through such meet and confer negotiations within 21 days of receipt of the \n28  letter raising the dispute, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation at \n      20  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 23 of 56\n1  JAMS in San Francisco.  JAMS shall assign Hon. Jamie Jacobs-May to \n2  mediate.  If she is not available within 45 days of the request to JAMS by the \n3  Parties, JAMS will assign another mutually-agreed upon mediator or a \n4  randomly assigned mediator if the Parties cannot mutually agree.  Uber shall \n5  pay the cost of the mediation.  If Uber declines to pay such costs, the dispute \n6  shall skip directly to Step Three. \n7  •  Step Three:  In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute \n8  through Step Two, they shall submit the dispute for binding resolution by the \n9  Federal District Court for the Northern District of California under the \n10  Court’s continuing jurisdiction over this case.  The Parties agree that \n11  Magistrate Judge Cousins shall continue to have jurisdiction to fully resolve \n12  any such dispute.  If Magistrate Judge Cousins becomes unavailable, the \n13  Parties agree to accept the jurisdiction of any other Magistrate Judge \n14  assigned by the Federal District Court for continuing jurisdiction purposes.  \n15  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may claim and recover reasonable fees and costs in \n16  connection with proceedings under this Step Three if Plaintiffs prevail in \n17  such proceedings.  Uber may recover its fees and costs in the event the \n18  Magistrate Judge finds Plaintiffs’ motion to be frivolous, unreasonable or \n19  groundless, or that Plaintiffs continued to litigate it after it clearly became so.  \n20  11.  Monetary Payments \n21  A.  Compensation for NFB \n22  Uber will make three payments of $75,000 during the 3.5 year term of the \n23  Agreement, totaling $225,000, payable to NFB National.  These payments \n24  are intended to support the testing program outlined elsewhere in this \n25  Agreement.  Uber shall make the first payment of $75,000 within 30 days \n26  after the Effective Date, and Uber shall make the second and third payments \n27  of $75,000 annually thereafter.  If this Agreement is extended pursuant to \n28  Section 7, then Uber shall make one additional payment of $75,000 to NFB \n      21  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 24 of 56\n1  within 30 days of the beginning of the Extended Agreement Term.  Uber \n2  shall remit these payments to TRE Legal Practice, c/o NFB, and make \n3  arrangements for wire transfer to the IOLTA trust account for the TRE Legal \n4  Practice.   \n5  B.  Damages to Individual Plaintiffs \n6  1.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Uber shall pay $45,000 to the \n7  Disability Rights Advocates Client Trust Account to be apportioned \n8  among the individual plaintiffs as they agree among themselves. \n9  2.  Uber shall mail this payment to Disability Rights Advocates, 2001 \n10  Center Street, Fourth Floor, Berkeley, CA 94704-1204. \n11  3.  Uber will issue a form 1099-MISC for this payment to Disability \n12  Rights Advocates. \n13  C.  Attorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expenses, and Costs \n14  The parties agree that, if the Parties do not agree on an appropriate amount of \n15  reasonable  attorneys’  fees,  Plaintiffs  may  seek  reasonable  attorneys’  fees,  litigation \n16  expenses and costs (hereafter collectively “Attorneys’ Fees”) and are entitled to apply to \n17  the Court for reasonable Attorneys’ Fees under applicable law.  Uber retains the right to \n18  dispute the amount of Attorneys’ Fees requested but agrees not to dispute the entitlement \n19  to reasonable Attorneys’ Fees incurred up through the Effective Date of this Agreement.  \n20  The Parties agree that Magistrate Judge Cousins shall determine the amount of reasonable \n21  Attorneys’ Fees incurred by Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their work on this matter up through \n22  the Effective Date after briefing by the Parties.  Judge Cousins shall also retain jurisdiction \n23  to resolve any disputes concerning Plaintiffs’ Attorneys’ Fees and to award such payments. \n24  1.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel expressly reserve their rights to \n25  pursue claims for attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses for work \n26  performed after the time the Settlement Agreement is signed by all \n27  Parties, including for work spent on compliance monitoring, \n28  enforcement, and/or work spent securing their fees and collecting any \n      22  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 25 of 56\n1  and all fees, costs and expenses that are due to them.  The Parties \n2  agree that all issues pertaining to any such attorneys’ fees, costs and \n3  expenses are unresolved and therefore are subject to the continuing \n4  jurisdiction of the Court.   \n5  2.  The Parties will use the following procedure to resolve Plaintiffs’ \n6  Counsel’s requests for attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses to monitor \n7  Uber’s compliance with this Agreement.  Beginning twelve (12) \n8  months after the Effective Date, Plaintiffs’ Counsel will annually \n9  submit a request for reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses to \n10  Uber for the preceding year of work.  Uber will have 45 days to \n11  contest or pay the requested amount of attorneys’ fees, costs and \n12  expenses.  Uber may contest the amount of attorneys’ fees, costs and \n13  expenses.  If Uber contests the amount of attorneys’ fees, costs or \n14  expenses, the Parties have 60 days to negotiate those amounts.  If \n15  disagreements as to such fees, costs and expenses cannot be \n16  informally resolved, they will be submitted to the Magistrate Judge \n17  who retains jurisdiction over this Agreement by appropriate motion.  \n18  The Parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction beyond the \n19  three and one half-year Term or five year Extended Agreement Term \n20  as necessary to resolve and award fees, costs and expenses for \n21  monitoring for the final year of the Agreement Term. \n22  12.  The Parties agree that the judgment entered by the Court after the Effective \n23  Date of this Agreement shall include the following language: “The parties, \n24  having negotiated resolution of claims asserted in this action agree that \n25  settlement has altered the legal and juridical relationship of the parties.  \n26  Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement between the Parties, the \n27  Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement, including \n28  without limitation, disputes over compliance with the terms of the \n      23  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 26 of 56\n1  Agreement and the amounts of attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, if any, to \n2  be paid to Plaintiffs’ attorneys.” \n3  13.  Filings, Preliminary Approval, Notice, Final Approval \n4  A.  Vacating Discovery and Trial Deadlines.  Within seven (7) days after \n5  execution of this Agreement by the Parties, the Parties shall apply to the Court for an order \n6  vacating the current discovery and trial deadlines in light of this Agreement.   \n7  B.  Preliminary Approval.  Within fourteen (14) days after the Court vacates \n8  the discovery and trial deadlines, the Parties will jointly move for an order granting \n9  amendment of the Complaint to include NFB National as a party and incorporate class \n10  relief, preliminary approval of the terms of this Agreement as a stipulated Class Action \n11  Settlement, provisional certification of the Settlement Class, approving the proposed form \n12  of notice to the Settlement Class, and scheduling a hearing for final approval of this \n13  Agreement within 120 days after preliminary approval of this Agreement, or as soon \n14  thereafter as the Court may set. \n15  C.  Objections and Responses.  Any member of the Settlement Class may \n16  object to the terms of this Agreement by filing, within 30 days after the Notice described in \n17  Section 13.D, below, is issued, written objections with the Court.  Only objecting \n18  Settlement Class Members will have the right, if they so request in their objection, to \n19  present objections orally at the hearing on final approval of the settlement.  Responses by \n20  the Parties to any objections must be filed within 30 days after the date for objections by \n21  Settlement Class Members has passed.  \n22  D.  Notice.  \n23  1.  As soon as practicable, but no later than three (3) weeks / twenty-one \n24  (21) days after the Court’s entry of a Preliminary Approval Order, \n25  Uber will pay the cost of publishing a stipulated class action \n26  settlement notice on a search-engine -optimized (“SEO”) settlement \n27  website operated by a stipulated class action settlement administrator.  \n28  Uber will pay the cost of the settlement administrator.  After the \n      24  3:14-cv-04086-NC \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n\n \nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 27 of 56\n1  settlement website is posted online, Uber will post a link to the \n2  settlement notice on its news blog (newsroom.uber.com) and \n3  https://www.facebook.com/uber within 30 days of the Preliminary \n4  Approval Order.  Uber will further pay the cost, if any, of ensuring the \n5  notice is published in the electronic newsletters and Braille magazines \n6  of the National Federation of the Blind and the American Council of \n7  the Blind so notice is sent out within 60 days of the Preliminary \n8  Approval Order. \n9  E.  Final Approval. \n10  1.  At the Final Approval Hearing, the Parties will jointly request that the \n11  Court enter a Final Judgment and Order granting Final Approval of \n12  this Settlement Agreement and certifying the Settlement Class.  \n13  2.  This action will be dismissed with prejudice under Federal Rules of \n14  Civil Procedure, Rule 41, within 30 days after expiration of the Term \n15  of this Agreement and after any remaining disputes concerning \n16  recovery of attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses have been resolved. \n17  14.

When To Use This Document: \nMembers of the Access Complaint Team should use this document when \nevaluating: \na.  Complaints from riders with service animals; AND \nb.  Driver-partner requests for cleaning fees for trips involving riders \nwith service animals. \nII.  What Is A “Service Animal”? \nService animals are animals that are trained to assist people with disabilities.  Most \nservice animals are dogs.  Service animals are trained to assist people with many different \ntypes of disabilities. \nHere are a few examples of common service animals.  Remember that there are \nother types of service animals as well. \n1.  Guide animals.  Guide animals, which are typically dogs, guide blind \npeople. \n2.  Signal dogs.  Signal dogs alert people who are deaf or hard of hearing to \nrelevant noises, such as a door bell or an alarm. \n3.  Seizure dogs.  Seizure dogs help people when they are having seizures. \n4.  Mobility assistance dogs.  These dogs assist people with mobility \ndisabilities by opening doors or retrieving dropped items. \nIII.  What Is Uber’s Service Animal Policy? \nGoverning law requires that driver-partners transport riders with service animals.  \nThere is no exemption for animal allergies, religious objections, or a generalized fear of \nanimals. \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 43 of 56\n \nUber will terminate its contractual relationship with a driver-partner in either of \nthe following situations: \n1.  Uber determines that the driver-partner knowingly refused to transport a \nrider with a service animal because of the service animal ; OR \n2.  Uber receives plausible complaints on more than one occasion that the \ndriver-partner refused to transport a rider with a service animal. \nIV.  Navigating A Service Animal Complaint \nAfter receiving a complaint that a driver-partner refused to transport a rider with a \nservice animal, you should do all of the following: \n1.  Investigate the complaint. \n2.  Determine whether the driver-partner violated his/her legal \nobligations and Uber’s service animal policy. \n3.  Determine, in conjunction with Legal, whether the driver-partner’s \nconduct warrants contract termination. \n4.  Follow up with the rider who experienced the denial of service. \n \nA.  Step 1:  Investigate The Complaint \n1.  Reach out to the rider or the person who filed the complaint to get more \ninformation about what happened.  Here are a few points to keep in mind \nfor the call: \na.  The rider does NOT need to disclose his or her specific disability. \nb.  The rider does NOT need to provide documentation proving that his \nor her animal is a service animal. \nc.  Inform the rider that you will follow up with him or her within one \nweek, if possible, to let the rider know what action was taken \nregarding the complaint. \nd.  If the rider had a companion or companions who observed the \nincident, you should also speak with these individuals if they are \nwilling to discuss the incident with you. \n2.  Reach out to the driver-partner to get more information about what \nhappened. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 44 of 56\na.  If this is the first complaint that the driver-partner has refused to take \na rider with a service animal, let the driver-partner know that Uber \nhas deactivated their account pending review of the complaint.  Then \nyou should ask the driver-partner to explain what happened during \nthe incident.  You should ask the driver-partner open-ended \nquestions to give the driver-partner an opportunity to fully explain \nhis or her understanding of the situation. \ni.  If the driver-partner tells you that the rider’s dog was \ndangerous or was out of control, you should ask the driver-\npartner to provide specific details about why he or she \nthought the dog was dangerous or out of control.  You should \nalso reach out to the rider again to ask him or her about the \ndog’s behavior during the incident. \nii.  If the driver-partner says that the rider’s dog had an accident \nor vomited in the vehicle, then you should ask the driver-\npartner to provide evidence (e.g., photo) of the accident. \nb.  If this is the second plausible complaint after [date by which all \ndrivers must accept service animal policy through Uber app] that the \ndriver-partner has refused to take a rider with a service animal, let \nthe driver-partner know that Uber has permanently deactivated their \naccount. \nB.  Step 2: Determine Whether The Driver-Partner Violated The Law \nThe driver-partner violated the law if the driver-partner knowingly refused to \ntransport a rider with a service animal because of the animal.   \nHere are the only situations where a driver-partner can lawfully refuse to transport \na rider with a service animal without violating the ADA or similar state law: \n1.  The rider’s service animal actually bit the driver-partner or another rider, or \nmade a serious attempt to bite the driver-partner or another rider.   \n2.  The rider’s service animal either urinated or defecated in the driver-\npartner’s vehicle. \n3.  The rider’s service animal was out of control and the rider was unable or \nunwilling to regain control over the service animal. \n4.  The driver-partner refused to transport the rider for reasons unrelated to the \nservice animal.  For example, the rider’s desired destination was far away, \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 45 of 56\nsuch as over one hundred miles, and the driver did not want to drive that \nfar. \nThe following are NOT acceptable reasons for a driver-partner to refuse to \ntransport a rider with a service animal: \n1.  The driver-partner is allergic to animals. \n2.  Another person who drives the vehicle is allergic to animals. \n3.  The driver-partner is afraid of animals or dislikes animals. \n4.  The driver-partner has religious or cultural objections to animals. \n5.  The rider did not have written documentation proving that the rider’s \nanimal is a service animal.  People with disabilities are not required to carry \ndocumentation proving that their animals are service animals. \n6.  The rider’s service animal was not wearing a special vest, ID tag, or \nharness.  Service animals are not required to wear special vests, ID tags, or \nharnesses. \n7.  The rider’s service animal began to bark or make other noises, but the rider \nstopped this behavior. \n8.  The rider’s service animal was smelly. \n9.  The driver-partner was worried that the rider’s service animal would shed \nhair in the vehicle. \n10.  The driver-partner was worried that the rider’s service animal would make \na mess by vomiting, urinating, or defecating in the vehicle. \nHow Do I Know If The Driver-Partner Is Subject To Contract Termination \nUnder Uber’s Service Animal Policy? \n1.  If this is the first service animal complaint against the driver-partner, you \nshould conclude that the driver-partner is subject to contract termination \nunder Uber’s service animal policy if: \na.  The driver-partner admits that he/she was on notice that the rider’s \nanimal was a service animal and that the driver-partner refused to \ntransport the rider because of the service animal; or \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 46 of 56\nb.  You obtain reliable evidence (including a text message thread or \nphone message) through your investigation of the incident showing \nall of the following are true: \ni.  The driver-partner refused to transport a rider with a service \nanimal. \nii.  The rider communicated to the driver-partner that the rider’s \nanimal was a service animal, or it was clear from the \ncircumstances that the rider’s animal was a service animal. \niii.  There was no legitimate reason for the driver’s refusal.  \nLegitimate reasons for canceling the ride include the service \nanimal not being housebroken, the service animal being out \nof control, the service animal engaging in dangerous behavior \nsuch as biting or attempted biting, and other permissible \nreasons unrelated to the service animal. \n2.  If this is the second service animal complaint against the driver-partner, you \nshould conclude that the driver-partner is subject to contract termination \nunder Uber’s service animal policy if it is the second such plausible \ncomplaint since [date when drivers must accept service animal policy in \npopup]. \nC.  Step 3: What Action To Take With The Driver-Partner? \nYou should terminate the driver-partner’s contractual relationship with Uber if the \nconduct in question meets the standards set forth in Section B above.  \nIf this is the first plausible complaint that a driver-partner refused a ride because of a \nservice animal and you do not determine that the driver-partner violated Uber’s service \nanimal policy, you should note in the driver-partner’s account that there was a complaint \nthat the driver-partner refused to transport a rider with a service animal.   You may not \nalways be able to reliably determine what happened without significant investigation.  In \nsuch cases a Rider’s complaint is always plausible unless there is an objective reason that \nthe Rider is misstating the facts or not telling the truth.  Disputes in which the Driver and \nthe Rider have competing plausible versions of what happened should be resolved in \nfavor of the Rider. \nD.  Step 4: Following Up With The Rider \nFirst, you must refund any cancellation fees that were charged in connection with \nthe cancelled trip that is the basis of the complaint. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 47 of 56\nIf you terminate Uber’s relationship with the driver-partner, you must provide the \nrider with a $25 account credit. \nYou must also email the rider within one week from the date of the complaint, if \npossible, to inform him or her about all of the following: \n1.  Whether Uber determined that the driver-partner violated Uber’s service \nanimal policy. \n2.  Whether Uber (i) terminated its relationship with the driver-partner (this \napplies if there was a knowing violation or if this is the second plausible \ncomplaint);  (ii) determined that the complaint was plausible but could not \ndetermine if there was an intentional violation, and thus has noted in the \ndriver-partner’s account that a plausible complaint was made against the \ndriver-partner (this applies if this is the first such plausible complaint); or \n(iii) determined that the complaint was not plausible.    (Customer service \nresponses need not use the word plausible so long as it is clear from the \nresponse that the complaint was not addressed by either termination or a \nwarning.) When noting in the driver-partner’s account that a plausible \ncomplaint has been made, you should explain to the rider that any second \ncomplaint submitted to Uber alleging that the particular driver-partner at \nissue refused to transport a rider with a service animal will result in \npermanent termination of Uber’s relationship with the driver-partner.  \n3.  Whether you have refunded any cancellation fees that were charged to the \nrider. \n4.  Whether Uber has issued an account credit to the rider. \nV.  When May Driver-Partners Recover Cleaning Fees From Riders With \nService Animals? \nDrivers-Partners may be entitled to a cleaning fee based on a ride provided to a \nrider with a service animal.  This section explains when it is appropriate to charge a \ncleaning fee to a rider with a service animal. \nYou may charge a rider with a service animal a cleaning fee in any of the \nfollowing situations: \n1.  The rider’s service animal urinates, vomits, or defecates in the driver-\npartner’s vehicle, and at least two reports have previously been submitted to \nUber asserting that the rider’s service animal urinated, vomited or defecated \nin a driver-partner’s vehicle. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 48 of 56\n2.  The rider’s service animal tears or shreds the upholstery in the driver-\npartner’s vehicle. \n3.  The rider’s service animal cracks, shatters, or destroys doors, windows, or \nvehicle controls in the driver-partner’s vehicle. \n4.  For any reason unrelated to the rider’s service animal where Uber would \nordinarily charge a rider without a service animal a cleaning fee.  For \nexample, the rider spills a beverage in the vehicle and stains the vehicle’s \nseats. \nYou may NOT charge a rider with a service animal a cleaning fee in any of the \nfollowing situations: \n1.  This is the first or second report that the rider’s service animal urinated, \nvomited, or defecated in a driver-partner’s vehicle; OR \n2.  The rider’s service animal shed hair in the driver-partner’s vehicle. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 49 of 56\n \nADDENDUM 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 50 of 56\n  \nAddendum 3 \nComplaint Submission Screens** \n \n[**Note: The engineering around this project is ongoing, and therefore the final product may not \ncomport precisely with the below.

As explained in Uber’s Non-\nDiscrimination Policy, driver-partners who engage in discriminatory conduct in violation \nof this legal obligation will lose access to the Uber platform.   \n \nWhat is a Service Animal? \n \nA service animal is an animal that is trained to work or perform tasks for an individual \nwith a disability.   \nThe law provides that there are only two questions that a driver-partner may ask to \nconfirm that a rider’s animal is a service animal:  1. Is the animal required because of a \ndisability?  And, 2. What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?  The \ndriver-partner may not request that the rider present documentation proving that the \nrider’s animal is a service animal. \n \nThere is no requirement that a service animal wear a tag, be registered, or display any \nkind of proof that it is a service animal.  \n \nLegal Obligations of Driver-Partners  \n \nDriver-Partners have a legal obligation to provide service to riders with service animals. \n \nA driver-partner CANNOT lawfully deny service to riders with service animals because \nof allergies, religious objections, or a generalized fear of animals. \n \nBy virtue of their written Technology Services Agreement with Uber, all driver-partners \non the Uber platform have been made aware of their legal obligation to provide service to \nriders with service animals and have agreed to comply with the law. If a driver-partner \nrefuses to drive a rider with a service animal because of the service animal, the driver-\npartner is in violation of the law and is in breach of their contract with Uber.  \n \nConsequences for Refusal to Transport a Rider with a Service Animal \n \nIf Uber determines that a driver-partner knowingly refused to transport a rider with a \nservice animal because of the service animal, the driver-partner will be permanently \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 55 of 56\nremoved from the Uber platform.  Uber shall make this determination in its sole \ndiscretion following a review of the incident.    \n \nIf Uber receives plausible complaints on more than one occasion from riders that a \nparticular driver-partner refused to transport a rider with a service animal, that driver-\npartner will be permanently removed from the Uber platform, regardless of the \njustification offered by the driver-partner.  \n \nHow to Report a Service Animal Complaint \n \nIf a rider has an issue related to his or her service animal—including issues regarding ride \ncancellations, harassment, or improper cleaning fees—the rider can report the issue to \nUber.  \n \nOnce a rider submits a service animal complaint, Uber’s Access Complaint Team will \ninvestigate the issue and take appropriate action in accordance with Uber’s Technology \nServices Agreement with driver-partners and this Service Animal Policy. The Access \nComplaint Team will make a reasonable and good faith effort to notify the rider within a \nweek of the outcome of the investigation and the actions taken.  \n \nTo file a complaint from the rider application, navigate to the “I Want To Report A \nService Animal Issue” complaint screen, which is available through both the trip details \nscreen and the account menu button.  \n \nTo file a complaint from the Uber website, select the [link] “I Want To Report A Service \nAnimal Issue” link here or through the “Help” link on the home page of the website. \n \n[Activating the “I Want To Report A Service Animal Issue” link will open a webpage \ncontaining a form that is substantially similar in function and appearance to the form \ndescribed in Addendum 3 of the settlement agreement.] \n \nRights of Riders with Service Animals \n \nRiders cannot be denied service because they travel with a service animal. A rider will be \nrefunded any trip cancellation charges or other charges imposed because a driver-partner \ndenied a Rider service because of a service animal.  \n \nRiders will be informed by Uber what action Uber takes in response to their complaint \nabout discrimination on the basis of a service animal, including whether Uber has \nterminated its contract with the driver-partner involved. \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-04086-NC   Document 85-1   Filed 04/29/16   Page 56 of 56\nA rider will be provided an account credit of $25 for each instance in which a driver-\npartner’s contractual relationship with Uber is terminated as the result of a report that the \ndriver-partner refused to transport the rider because of a service animal.  \n \nCleaning Fees \n \nRiders cannot be charged cleaning fees for shedding by their service animals. Riders will \nbe refunded any cleaning fees charged for shedding by their service animals. \n \nA rider will not be charged for the first or second reported mess involving a service \nanimal’s bodily fluids. A rider can be charged for the third reported mess involving a \nservice animal’s bodily fluids. The rider may contest that such a mess occurred by \nresponding to the fee notification email to notify customer support.  If a rider contests the \ncleaning fee, Uber will make a reasonable good faith effort to determine whether a mess \noccurred. \n  \n ",

This action seeks to put an end to systemic civil rights violations committed by \n3  Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries operating in California, Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-\n4  CA, LLC, (collectively “Uber” or “Defendants”) in California against blind individuals who use \n5  guide dogs. Plaintiff National Federation of the Blind (“NFB”) of California sues on behalf of its \n6  members, including Plaintiff Kelly, who has been and will continue to be denied access to \n7  Uber’s UberX taxi service and Plaintiff Hingson, who has been and continues to be deterred \n8  from using Uber’s UberX taxi service, all because Uber has failed to ensure that blind riders with \n9  service animals, including many other members of Plaintiff NFB of California, can access \n10  Uber’s taxi services. Likewise, Michael Pedersen, a blind resident of San Francisco who uses a \n11  guide dog, also sues alongside Plaintiff NFB of California because Pedersen has been and will \n12  continue to be denied access to UberX taxi services on the basis of his using a service animal. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      2.  Uber offers the UberX taxi service to sighted individuals in California. UberX is \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  highly  cost-effective and widely available.

Further, UberX drivers across the United States are likewise \n22  refusing to transport blind individuals, including identified UberX drivers who denied rides to \n23  one blind woman on twelve separate occasions, charged blind riders cancellation fees, refused \n24  service to a blind parent on her way to a pharmacy to get a prescription for her feverish toddler, \n25  and abandoned blind travelers in extreme weather, all because of guide dogs. In total, Plaintiffs \n26  are aware of more than forty instances where drivers of UberX vehicles refused to transport blind \n27  individuals with service animals. UberX drivers that refused to transport these blind individuals \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

The UberX drivers denied the requested \n2  transportation service after the drivers had arrived and discovered that the riders used service \n3  animals.  \n4  4.  In addition, some UberX drivers seriously mishandle guide dogs, harass blind \n5  customers with guide dogs, or give low feedback scores to passengers with service animals even \n6  when drivers do not outright deny the provision of taxi service. For example, Leena Dawes is \n7  blind and uses a guide dog. An UberX driver locked Ms. Dawes’ guide dog in the closed trunk of \n8  the UberX sedan before transporting Ms. Dawes. When Ms. Dawes realized where the driver had \n9  placed her dog, she demanded that the driver pull over so that she could retrieve her dog from the \n10  trunk, but the driver refused her request. Other blind customers with guide dogs have been yelled \n11  at by Uber drivers who are hostile toward their guide dogs. In addition, upon information and \n12  belief, passengers with service animals receive lower average ratings from UberX drivers. A \nATES  LOOR1204  13   lo w er rating reduces the probability that Uber will provide transportation to a passenger in the \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  future  or reassign that same driver to transport the passenger with the service animal. \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     th  e d  is c5r i.m  inatoMrya ntrye oatfm theenste t hbalitn tdh einy deixvpideuriaelns cseudb.m Hiottwede vwerri,t tUenb ecro hmaps lfaaiinletsd t too U nboetirf yc omnocestr noifn g \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   tdhi escseip ilnindeivdi tdhuea lrse lreevgaanrdt iUnbge wrXh edthrievre Ursb, eorr  htaaks etnh oarnoyu gohthlyer i nmveeasntiignagtfeudl  tshteepirs  ctoom enpslauirnet sth, at these \n \n19  drivers do not continue to unlawfully discriminate against them or other individuals with service \n20  animals.

Meanwhile, many of these blind individuals experience \n22  ongoing denials from multiple drivers.  \n23  6.  Plaintiff Kelly is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of California. \n24  Mr. Kelly travels in UberX vehicles with companions who use the Uber app. Mr. Kelly and his \n25  companions have been denied access to UberX taxi services because of the presence of Mr. \n26  Kelly’s service animal. \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Plaintiff Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of \n2  California. Mr. Hingson, a public speaker and best-selling author, travels extensively throughout \n3  California and has traveled with a guide dog for decades. Mr. Hingson is aware of Uber’s \n4  widespread discrimination against blind individuals with service animals, and Mr. Hingson has \n5  refrained and continues to refrain from creating an Uber user account or otherwise using Uber’s \n6  transportation services because he fears experiencing similar discrimination. Mr. Hingson has \n7  been deterred from using UberX on many specific occasions when it would have been \n8  convenient for him to use Uber’s services.  \n9  8.  Plaintiff Pedersen is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a resident of San Francisco, \n10  California. Mr. Pedersen has been denied access to UberX taxi services multiple times because \n11  of the presence of his service animal. Mr. Pedersen will continue to attempt to use the UberX \n12  service. Mr. Pedersen would like to continue using UberX taxi services without fear that UberX \nATES  LOOR1204  13   dr iv ers will refuse to transport him. \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   9.

These blind riders are also often \n20  placed in the uncomfortable position of explaining to uninformed UberX drivers that service \n21  animals are protected by law and that blind people have the right to bring service animals into \n22  vehicles providing taxi services.  \n23  11.  Uber is violating basic equal access requirements under both the ADA and state \n24  law by failing to implement policies and procedures that would prevent or reduce discrimination \n25  against blind riders committed by UberX drivers. Because Uber closely monitors and tightly \n26  controls interactions between UberX drivers and its customers, Uber can implement policies and \n27  procedures, including policies and procedures that leverage its mobile smart phone software \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

However, Uber insists that it is not a transportation provider and that it \n3  is not legally obligated to take any steps to ensure that its drivers do not discriminate against \n4  blind riders. Uber maintains this position despite the fact that the California Public Utilities \n5  Commission ruled that Uber is a transportation provider operating the UberX transportation \n6  service. \n7  12.  UberX and other similar taxi services are a critical transportation option for many \n8  blind individuals in California. Due to distances between destinations and the limitations of \n9  public transportation and paratransit, many blind persons must use taxi services to travel from \n10  one place to another. The fact that UberX vehicles have frequently refused to transport Plaintiffs \n11  Kelly and Pedersen and other blind riders with service animals, and that this discrimination \n12  deters Plaintiff Hingson and other members of Plaintiff NFB of California with service animals \nATES  LOOR1204  13   fr om  using UberX, means that members of Plaintiff NFB of California are denied full and equal \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  access  to this critical mode of transportation. \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     tra  n  sp or1 t3at.  ion nDeutwe otork t hceo mpupbalnicie’ss  awried qesupicrekalyd  saudpoppltaionnti nogf  tsrmadairtti opnhaoln teasx,i U cobmer paanndi eost haenrd  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   mbe ocsotm oifn Cg atlhifeo prnuibal’isc ’lsa rpgreimst acriyti eosp tainodn  ifso rq uoinc-kdleym spanreda tdaixnig s. e rvices.

NFB of California’s \n27  mission is to promote the vocational, cultural, and social advancement of the blind; to achieve \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Securing access to the UberX taxi service advances NFB of \n5  California’s goal to promote integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality by \n6  enabling blind individuals to travel in the same way that many sighted individuals travel. UberX \n7  drivers have refused to transport members of NFB of California because they have service \n8  animals. NFB of California sues on behalf of its members who have been denied access to or \n9  deterred from using the UberX service due to unlawful discrimination against blind individuals \n10  with service animals. NFB of California also sues in furtherance of its extensive efforts and \n11  expenditure of resources in advancing its mission to improve independence of the blind. \n12  Securing access to the UberX service advances this mission because access to the UberX service \nATES  LOOR1204  13   en a bles blind individuals to travel more independently.

Plaintiff Michael Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB of \n2  California, and currently resides in Victorville, California. Mr. Hingson is a public speaker and a \n3  best-selling author who has traveled with a guide dog for decades. Mr. Hingson regularly travels \n4  and regularly uses taxis within California for work and leisure. Mr. Hingson often travels to Los \n5  Angeles and Sacramento in connection with his advocacy work for NFB of California. He also \n6  regularly travels to San Francisco for personal and professional business. Though Mr. Hingson \n7  would like to use the UberX transportation service, he is deterred from signing up for and \n8  attempting to use Uber’s transportation services because of the discrimination that other blind \n9  guide dog users have experienced when attempting to use the UberX taxi service. Mr. Hingson \n10  owns and regularly uses an iPhone capable of running the Uber iPhone application, and Mr. \n11  Hingson has a credit card that he could use to pay for the UberX taxi service.  \n12  25.

Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc., a for-profit transportation network company \n25  based in California, with its subsidiaries Defendants Rasier, LLC and Rasier-CA, LLC, provides \n26  transportation services through thousands of vehicles in California.

Uber closely monitors and controls \n2  interactions between its drivers and customers. Uber’s customers request rides through Uber; \n3  Uber identifies an available driver to transport each customer; Uber bills customers for their rides \n4  in UberX vehicles; Uber provides customers with receipts; and Uber handles inquiries and \n5  complaints from customers concerning Uber’s drivers and taxi services. Uber also controls the \n6  financial transaction associated with each ride that UberX drivers provide to customers.  \n7  28.  Defendants Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of \n8  Uber that operate within the state of California. Upon information and belief, these subsidiaries \n9  are required parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a)(1) because in their \n10  absence, the court cannot accord complete relief from Uber alone.  \n11  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n12  29.  Uber provides several different taxi services to members of the general public in a \nATES  LOOR1204  13   ra pi dly expanding number of metropolitan areas across California and the United States. Uber’s \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  taxi se rvices vary based on the type of vehicle providing the transportation.

Uphboenr es \n \n19  that customers use to request transportation from Uber for themselves and/or guests. An UberX \n20  taxi vehicle is able to transport a single passenger or group of passengers traveling together up to \n21  the safe capacity of the requested vehicle, which is usually no more than four passengers. \n22  30.  To use the UberX taxi service, a customer submits a request on behalf of himself \n23  or other passengers through one of Uber’s mobile software applications. Once Uber identifies the \n24  vehicle that will provide the requester or the requester’s party with taxi service, Uber notifies the \n25  requester either by text message or through its smart phone application. The notification includes \n26  the UberX driver’s name, customer rating, phone number, vehicle license plate number, make \n27  and model of the UberX vehicle, and the driver’s estimated time of arrival.

Requesting customers may \n3  also submit the desired trip destination through Uber’s mobile application. \n4  31.  Uber notifies the requesting customer once his or her UberX vehicle has arrived. \n5  The requester or any other associated passengers may then board the vehicle. If the requesting \n6  customer submitted the destination address to Uber, then Uber will supply the UberX driver with \n7  turn-by-turn directions to the desired destination. If the requesting customer did not enter the \n8  destination into Uber’s application, the passenger(s) must provide the driver with the desired \n9  destination. The driver then starts the fare meter in the Uber software application and proceeds to \n10  the desired destination. When the vehicle arrives at the desired destination, the driver ends the \n11  trip in the Uber smart phone application. \n12  32.  Uber decides who may provide its UberX taxi service. Individuals who wish to \nATES  LOOR1204  13   pr ov ide UberX taxi services must take an exam, undergo a criminal background check, undergo \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  a driv ing record check, present their driver’s license, vehicle registration, and driver’s insurance, \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     atrni  pd    rceo qmu pesl etste a vrea rtiroaunss mfoirttmeds .t Oo neacceh a no fi nitdsi vUibdeuraXl  bdercivoemrse.s  Uanb eUr baelsroX e dxreirvceirs,e Us bexerc lcuosnivtreo clso nwthroicl h \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   oinv celru dteirnmg ifnoart ipoono or fr aUtibnegrsX f rdormiv ecruss, taonmde Ursb. er routinely terminates drivers for several reasons, \n \n19  33.  Uber also controls who may use the UberX taxi service. Uber makes the UberX \n20  service available only to passengers when at least one requesting customer has a credit card and a \n21  smart phone that can run one of its mobile applications, creates an Uber account, and requests a \n22  ride through Uber’s mobile application. Customers cannot access the UberX taxi service by \n23  physically hailing an UberX vehicle on the street. \n24  34.  Uber exercises significant control over the UberX taxi service, and Uber has \n25  detailed requirements for driver conduct and appearance. Uber has requirements for the type and \n26  age of the vehicle that drivers may use to provide the UberX taxi service. In addition, before an \n27  UberX driver may use a vehicle to provide UberX taxi services in California, the vehicle must \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Uber also requires that UberX drivers refrain from smoking while providing \n2  Uber taxi services, refrain from asking customers to give them five-star ratings, and meet or \n3  exceed the estimated time-of-arrival that Uber generates and provides to each customer. In \n4  addition, Uber instructs UberX drivers that the share of trip requests that they accept through \n5  Uber’s application should be consistently high, and that UberX drivers may not accept street \n6  hails from potential passengers. Furthermore, Uber issues training and directives concerning \n7  other requirements to UberX drivers. \n8  35.  Uber also closely monitors its UberX drivers. Uber records many details about the \n9  taxi services that its UberX drivers provide, including for each trip: (1) the pickup location, (2) \n10  the time of pickup, (3) the drop off location, (4) the time of drop off, (5) the distance traveled, (6) \n11  the trip route, (7) the trip duration, and (8) the customer’s identity. Uber employees who \n12  supervise drivers have easy access to this data. In addition, Uber periodically reviews the driving \nATES  LOOR1204  13   re co rd for each of its UberX drivers. Uber also monitors its UberX drivers’ performance by \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  asking  customers for written feedback after every ride that a driver provides, and Uber routinely \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     fcoo  lnloc  ewr sn  iunpg   wUibthe rcXu sdtorimveerrss  dwoh soo e bxyp rceosnst adcistisnagti sUfabcetri.o Fn.u Crthuestrommoerers,  Uwbheor  wreigshu ltaor llyo dtegrem cionmatpesla oinr ts \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   su spend3s6 U. berXIn  dardivdeitriso nw,h Uobsee ra pvreoravgidee csu UstboemrXer  drraitvinegrs f waliltsh b seulpopwl iae sc enretcaeinss tahrrye stoh oplrdo. vide \n \n19  Uber’s taxi services. Uber provides UberX drivers with iPhones loaded with Uber’s smart phone \n20  application. When providing Uber’s taxi services, drivers use these phones to receive and \n21  respond to trip requests, receive GPS-based navigational guidance, record the beginning and end \n22  of each trip, communicate with customers, and cancel trips. In addition, Uber maintains general \n23  commercial liability insurance to cover claims concerning incidents that occur while drivers are \n24  providing UberX taxi services. \n25  37.  Uber tightly controls payment for its UberX taxi services. Customers do not pay \n26  drivers of Uber vehicles directly. Instead, Uber automatically charges a customer’s credit card \n27  after the UberX vehicle arrives at the desired destination. Uber has exclusive control over the \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Fares for Uber’s taxi \n2  services are based on the duration and distance of each trip and other factors such as demand at \n3  the time and place of the ride, as determined by Uber’s algorithms. Uber keeps twenty percent of \n4  each fare. Thus, Uber compensates its UberX drivers based on the duration and distance of the \n5  trips that they provide to passengers. Payments are not transferred directly from customers to \n6  UberX drivers; rather, Uber collects and holds customer payments, deducts fees, and then later \n7  transfers money to drivers on a set schedule. Customers who dispute the fare for a particular trip \n8  must contact Uber customer service representatives to request an adjustment to their fares.  \n9  38.  Thus, Uber closely monitors and controls interactions between UberX drivers and \n10  customers. Uber decides which of its UberX drivers may transport each customer. In addition, \n11  Uber specifies how quickly each UberX driver should pick up each customer. After UberX \n12  drivers pick up customers, Uber routinely provides UberX drivers with directions to customers’ \nATES  LOOR1204  13   de st inations, and Uber specifies driver conduct that is prohibited while UberX drivers transport \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  custom ers.

Furthermore, customers who forget personal property in \n20  UberX vehicles may contact Uber to request assistance retrieving that property. \n21  39.  On September 19, 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission ruled that \n22  Uber is a transportation provider with respect to the UberX service. The Commission requires \n23  that Uber possess a Class P Charter Party Carrier permit issued by the Commission to operate the \n24  UberX service in California. The Commission concluded that Uber is a transportation provider \n25  because Uber provides essentially the same function as a taxi dispatch office and because Uber \n26  controls payment for its transportation services. The Commission also explained that the fact that \n27  a smart phone application is used to arrange Uber’s transportation service is irrelevant to whether \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

In addition, the Commission stated that Uber may not \n2  discriminate against people with disabilities in the provision of its UberX transportation service \n3  and required that Uber’s website and mobile applications comply with Level AA of version 2.0 \n4  of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. \n5  40.  Members of Plaintiff NFB of California and other blind individuals use Uber’s \n6  UberX taxi service. Many of these individuals operate Uber’s smart phone software application \n7  using text-to-speech technology that is built into iPhones. Text-to-speech software, commonly \n8  used by persons who are blind or visually impaired, enables blind persons to operate smart \n9  phones by translating visual information and text displayed on a touchscreen device into audible \n10  synthesized speech or into Braille on a portable electronic braille display.  \n11  41.  UberX drivers have refused on the basis of disability to transport many blind \n12  individuals with service animals, including members of Plaintiff NFB of California.  \nATES  LOOR1204  13      42.  For example, Jamey Gump is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  Califo rnia.

On or about May 21, 2014, another UberX driver refused to transport Mr. Gump \n24  and a friend who also uses a service animal because of their service animals. On that occasion, \n25  Mr. Gump and Manveen Chahal, a friend and fellow member of NFB of California who also \n26  uses a service animal, were enjoying an evening at the Dutch Goose, a local pub in downtown \n27  Menlo Park, California.

After the \n2  requested UberX vehicle had pulled up to the curb, Mr. Gump and Mr. Chahal attempted to enter \n3  the vehicle and opened a passenger door. The UberX driver began shouting “no dogs!” Mr. \n4  Gump tried to explain that their dogs were service animals for their disabilities and were legally \n5  allowed in the vehicle. The UberX driver began shouting and cursing at Mr. Gump and Mr. \n6  Chahal in a language that Mr. Gump did not understand. Mr. Chahal speaks the language and \n7  was offended by the profanity and insults. As Mr. Gump attempted to enter the vehicle, the \n8  UberX driver quickly accelerated the vehicle forward, nearly injuring Mr. Gump’s guide dog and \n9  causing an open passenger door to strike Mr. Chahal. The UberX driver then sped away and \n10  cancelled the ride request. Mr. Gump and Mr. Chahal immediately called the police to file a \n11  report and used alternative transportation to travel home approximately forty-five minutes later.  \n12  44.

Mr. Gump wants to use the UberX taxi service because it is available near his \n23  home, an area with limited public transportation, and it would be convenient if it was reliably \n24  accessible and non-discriminatory. However, after this most recent experience, he has used Uber \n25  less frequently than previously because he concluded that it is not a reliable transportation option \n26  for him.

Cody Austin Meyer is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of \n5  California. An UberX driver refused to transport Mr. Meyer on September 30, 2014. On that \n6  occasion, Mr. Meyer was shopping at a grocery store in the Mission Valley Shopping Center in \n7  Fremont, California and needed a way to transport his groceries back to his apartment. Mr. \n8  Meyer used the Uber iPhone app to request an UberX vehicle. An UberX driver was assigned to \n9  pick Mr. Meyer up at the shopping center. Mr. Meyer was standing on the curb in the shopping \n10  center waiting for the assigned UberX driver when Mr. Meyer noticed a vehicle pull up near \n11  where he was standing and remain inactive for an extended period of time.

Juanita Herrera is a blind college student, uses a guide dog, is a member of NFB \n6  of California, and resides in Southern California. Ms. Herrera is interested in using the UberX \n7  service because it is more convenient and affordable than other taxi options. She attempted to use \n8  the UberX service for the first time on August 7, 2014. She requested a ride from the Macy’s \n9  store located at 6200 Slauson Avenue in Culver City, California. She was standing in front of the \n10  store waiting for her requested ride when an Uber driver approached her and asked if she was \n11  waiting for Uber. She answered yes, and the Uber driver asked if her dog was coming with her. \n12  She told him that her dog would accompany her and that her dog is not a pet. She explained that \nATES  LOOR1204  13   he r  dog is a service animal and that he was legally required to take both her and her service \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  anima l.

When these drivers were willing to speak with him, Mr. Schulenburg explained to the \n23  drivers that he had the legal right to bring his service animal with him, but the drivers ignored his \n24  explanations, and many of the drivers informed him that they had not received training \n25  concerning service animals. In addition, Uber has charged him cancellation fees after some \n26  UberX drivers refused to transport him, and Mr. Schulenburg has been forced to submit written \n27  complaints to Uber to get these fees refunded.

However, Uber has failed to inform Mr. Schulenburg whether Uber disciplined the \n4  relevant drivers or took any other steps to ensure that these drivers would not unlawfully \n5  discriminate against him again or other individuals with service animals. Instead, Uber \n6  responded to some of Mr. Schulenburg’s complaints by stating that Uber cannot control its \n7  drivers’ conduct because the drivers are independent contractors and by advising Mr. \n8  Schulenburg that he should inform UberX drivers of their legal obligation to allow his service \n9  animal to accompany him.  \n10  53.  Richard Rueda is blind, uses a guide dog, and resides in California. Mr. Rueda \n11  attended the annual convention for NFB of California, which was held in Southern California on \n12  October 9-12, 2014. In connection with Mr. Rueda’s travels to and from that convention, at least \nATES  LOOR1204  13   tw o  different UberX drivers refused to transport him because of his service animal.

Mr. Rueda called the driver \n22  to inform her of his location and to inform her that he had a service animal. In response, the \n23  driver stated that she could not transport him because of the dog and then canceled his ride \n24  request. Mr. Rueda then requested a second Uber vehicle. Again, after Mr. Rueda spoke with this \n25  driver on the phone, the driver canceled the trip. Mr. Rueda made a third attempt and requested a \n26  third Uber vehicle.

Thomas Foley is blind, uses a guide dog, and resides in California. An UberX \n4  driver refused to transport Mr. Foley on or about September 5, 2014. On that occasion, Mr. Foley \n5  used the Uber app to request an UberX ride from his place of work in Berkeley, California on his \n6  way to an appointment. He waited for his ride in front of the building. The Uber app notified Mr. \n7  Foley that his vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, was arriving, and a few seconds later a car pulled up \n8  about ten feet from him. Mr. Foley proceeded to the car, reached for the door, and shouted \n9  “Uber?” The car then drove away. Approximately 30 seconds later, the Uber app informed Mr. \n10  Foley that the driver had cancelled his ride. Mr. Foley then conferred with a sighted individual at \n11  a nearby bus stop who confirmed that the car that just drove away was a Toyota Corolla and that \n12  the driver looked at Mr. Foley and his guide dog shortly before leaving the scene.

On both occasions, Uber charged Mr. Cadigan cancellation fees after the UberX drivers \n23  cancelled the trip. Mr. Cadigan was forced to submit written complaints to Uber and to wait one \n24  to three business days to get these cancellation fees refunded. His written complaints also \n25  described the discrimination that he experienced. Mr. Cadigan is unsatisfied with Uber’s \n26  responses to his complaints.

UberX drivers refused to transport \n4  her in the Boston area because of her service animal on at least five separate occasions over the \n5  previous year. On one of those occasions she was left stranded in the rain while trying to secure \n6  replacement transportation. Ms. Fleschner was unable to submit a complaint on Uber’s website \n7  because of accessibility barriers in the design of that website that prevent a blind person from \n8  using it with standard screen access software. \n9  59.  Melissa Riccobono is blind and uses a guide dog. An UberX driver refused to \n10  transport Ms. Riccobono in the Baltimore, Maryland, area on October 8, 2014. On that occasion, \n11  Ms. Riccobono needed to travel to a local pharmacy to pick up a prescription for her sick child, \n12  who had a high fever. The UberX driver that she had requested using Uber’s app refused to take \nATES  LOOR1204  13   he r  because of her service animal.

When the requested UberX vehicle arrived, Ms. Harris \n21  received a notification in the Uber app. Ms. Harris’s friend who uses a service animal went \n22  outside to intercept the vehicle. The UberX driver refused to let Ms. Harris’s friend into the \n23  vehicle because of her guide dog. Ms. Harris then came out of the house with her guide dog and \n24  approached the vehicle to talk to the UberX driver through the open driver-side window. The \n25  UberX driver told Ms. Harris that he did not have to take the dogs because the vehicle was his \n26  own personal car. Ms. Harris explained that the ADA required the UberX driver to transport the \n27  dogs and that the driver could lose his job if he did not comply. The UberX driver disagreed, \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Dimitrios Kouniaris is blind and uses a guide dog. During August 2014, UberX \n6  drivers refused to transport Mr. Kouniaris on two occasions in Austin, Texas because of his \n7  service animal. On both occasions, Mr. Kouniaris was stranded in temperatures of over 100 °F as \n8  he waited for alternative transportation. Uber also charged Mr. Kouniaris a cancellation fee and \n9  only refunded it after he complained. Mr. Kouniaris has since stopped using the UberX service \n10  because he does not want to face the risk that additional UberX drivers will refuse to transport \n11  him or mistreat him because of his service animal. However, Mr. Kouniaris wants safe reliable \n12  access to the UberX service. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      62.

Once Ms. Dawes had realized that her dog was in the trunk, she demanded that the \n20  driver pull over so that she could retrieve her dog, but the driver refused her request. Ms. Dawes \n21  transmitted a written complaint about this incident to Uber. Uber has failed to inform Ms. Dawes \n22  whether Uber fully investigated her complaint or took any meaningful action to ensure that the \n23  driver does not abuse service animals in this manner in the future. \n24  64.  Uber also employs a rating system of its customers that tends to disparately affect \n25  blind passengers with service animals and reduce their access to the service. After every \n26  completed ride, Uber allows its drivers to rate each passenger on a scale from one to five similar \n27  to the scale passengers are given to rate every driver after a ride concludes. Upon information \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Uber drivers can also review an assigned passenger’s \n3  average rating by other Uber drivers before deciding whether to travel to pick up that assigned \n4  passenger. When Uber drivers do begrudgingly accept a passenger with a service animal who has \n5  successfully persuaded a driver not to violate the law, the Uber driver has an incentive to rate \n6  that passenger lower on the rating scale, which will make it less likely that Uber will assign that \n7  same driver to that passenger again in the future. This creates a system in which blind passengers \n8  with service animals have fewer options to connect with drivers. \n9  65.  Many of the preceding blind individuals submitted written complaints to Uber \n10  concerning the discriminatory treatment that they had experienced. However, Uber has failed to \n11  inform most of these individuals whether Uber has fully investigated their complaints, \n12  disciplined the relevant drivers, or taken any other meaningful steps to ensure that these drivers \nATES  LOOR1204  13   do  n ot unlawfully discriminate against other individuals with service animals.

Plaintiff Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFB of \n2  California. Mr. Hingson previously downloaded the Uber app onto his iPhone but ultimately \n3  decided against creating an account and trying to use the service. Mr. Hingson learned that \n4  UberX drivers often refuse to transport blind individuals with service animals. Because of Mr. \n5  Hingson’s position as Vice President of the National Association of Guide Dog Users and his \n6  longstanding involvement with membership activities within NFB of California, he has specific \n7  and general knowledge of the experiences of multiple Uber passengers with service animals who \n8  have been denied access. Through his regular contact with members of NFB of California and \n9  other members of the blind community, Mr. Hingson has known of specific refusals by UberX \n10  drivers to transport individuals with guide dogs over the past year. Additionally, through his \n11  activities with NFB of California, Mr. Hingson regularly attends events where fellow blind \n12  attendees with service animals are having trouble using the UberX service. Most recently, Mr. \nATES  LOOR1204  13   H in gson attended the annual state convention for NFB of California, which was held at the \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  Emba ssy Suites South, El Segundo, CA, on October 9-12, 2014.

Mr. Hingson was deterred from using UberX on many specific occasions. For \n20  example, on or about December 5, 2013, Mr. Hingson was planning to travel to a job interview \n21  at an executive recruiting firm in San Francisco. At that time, Mr. Hingson was aware that Uber \n22  was available in San Francisco. However, because of a tight schedule, Mr. Hingson decided not \n23  to attempt to use the UberX taxi service because he could not afford to be delayed by an UberX \n24  driver refusing to take his guide dog. Instead, Mr. Hingson arranged for a taxicab well in \n25  advance of his transit and extended his trip so that he could use nondiscriminatory transportation \n26  services to travel to his appointment on time.  \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v.

Plaintiff Hingson was further deterred from using Uber on January 20, 2014. On \n2  that occasion, Mr. Hingson needed to quickly travel from the Ferry Building in San Francisco to \n3  a speaking engagement at Wells Fargo. Mr. Hingson could not risk arriving late for this \n4  important professional engagement. Mr. Hingson wanted to use UberX because of its general \n5  convenience and the quality of the vehicles. However, he was deterred from doing so because he \n6  did not want to wait for the UberX vehicle to arrive and then discover that the driver would \n7  refuse to take his service animal.  \n8  70.  Plaintiff Hingson was similarly deterred from using Uber on or about May 15, \n9  2014. Mr. Hingson needed to travel within San Francisco to a meeting with a press contact. Mr. \n10  Hingson wanted to use UberX to attend this meeting. However, Mr. Hingson wanted to be \n11  focused for this meeting and believed the stress of encountering an improperly trained UberX \n12  driver that refused to transport his service animal would cause him stress and negatively affect \nATES  LOOR1204  13   hi s  performance at the meeting.  \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   71.

Plaintiff Hingson would like to use UberX for future travel. For example, Mr. \n21  Hingson will travel to Sacramento on March 9, 2015 for business. Mr. Hingson would like to use \n22  UberX for traveling around Sacramento if he had some assurance that he would not be denied \n23  transportation because of his service animal. Mr. Hingson would like to use UberX on this and \n24  many other upcoming trips. However, UberX is currently not a reliable source of transportation \n25  for Mr. Hingson because of the risk that an UberX driver will refuse to transport him and his \n26  service animal. Mr. Hingson hopes that Uber will take responsibility for the conduct of its \n27  drivers and use the control that it has over them to prevent and minimize discrimination.

Plaintiff Pedersen is blind, uses a guide dog, and resides in San Francisco, \n6  California. Mr. Pedersen regularly uses transportation services, such as UberX, to commute to \n7  work. Over the previous year, UberX drivers refused to transport Mr. Pedersen multiple times \n8  because of his guide dog.  \n9  74.  Most recently, on or about September 12, 2014, Mr. Pedersen’s wife used her \n10  Uber account to request an Uber vehicle for Mr. Pedersen as he was preparing to leave for work \n11  in the morning. Mr. Pedersen heard that the UberX driver had pulled up in front of his home and \n12  went outside to enter the vehicle. Mr. Pedersen knocked on the window of the vehicle and asked, \nATES  LOOR1204  13   “U b er?” The UberX driver said, “yes, but I don’t take dogs.” Mr. Pedersen explained that his dog \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  was a  service animal and the UberX driver was legally required to transport him.

Members of Plaintiff NFB of California including Plaintiffs Kelly and Hingson \n4  are qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of Title III of the ADA. Plaintiff \n5  Pedersen is also a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of Title III of the \n6  ADA. \n7  79.  Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full \n8  and equal enjoyment of specified public transportation services provided by a private entity that \n9  is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect \n10  commerce. 42 U.S.C. § 12184(a); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(a), (f). \n11  80.

It is a violation of Title III for private entities providing specified public \n2  transportation to fail to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when \n3  such modifications are necessary to afford the entity’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n4  advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate \n5  that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, \n6  facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12184(b)(2)(a), \n7  12182(b)(2)(a)(ii); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(f); 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(a). \n8  84.  By failing to modify practices, policies, and procedures to ensure that drivers of \n9  UberX vehicles are properly trained and do not refuse to transport Plaintiffs and other blind \n10  individuals with service animals, Defendants are denying Plaintiffs full and equal access to the \n11  specified public transportation offered by Defendants. \n12  85.

The regulations implementing Title III of the ADA require that private entities \n6  operating demand responsive transportation systems, including demand responsive systems that \n7  are also specified public transportation, must train personnel to proficiency so that they operate \n8  vehicles safely and properly assist and treat individuals with disabilities. 49 C.F.R. § 37.173. \n9  90.  On information and belief, Defendants also violate Title III of the ADA by failing \n10  to train Defendants’ personnel to proficiency so that they properly assist and treat Plaintiffs and \n11  other blind customers with service animals. \n12  91.

No. 25 \n tla v. \nciC 14   \nrts fo UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.; \niD tc 15  RASIER, LLC; RASIER-CA, LLC,   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants. \nS  n  \ndr 17  The National Federation of the Blind of California and three individuals allege that \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Uber and its California subsidiaries discriminate against blind persons by refusing to \nN\n19  transport guide dogs.  Plaintiffs charge that Uber’s practices violate the Americans with \n20  Disabilities Act, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, and the California Disabled \n21  Persons Act.  Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to establish standing \n22  and failure to state a claim, and also move for a more definite statement.  Specifically, \n23  defendants allege that NFBC, Hingson, and Pedersen do not have standing to sue under the \n24  ADA or state law claims and that Uber is not a public accommodation under the ADA.   \n25    Guided by the policy of encouraging private enforcement of anti-discrimination \n26  statutes, the Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged both standing and a \n27  plausible claim under the ADA and state law.  Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion to \n28  dismiss on all grounds.  Uber must answer the complaint.\n \nCase No.: 14-cv-04086-NC \n\n \n1  I.  BACKGROUND \n2  UberX is a widely available transportation service that uses mobile software \n3  applications to arrange rides between passengers and Uber’s fleet of UberX drivers.  First \n4  Amended Complaint (“FAC”), Dkt. No. 17, at ¶ 2.  To use UberX services, an individual \n5  must either (1) create a user account, and provide Uber with his phone number, credit card \n6  information, and email address, or (2) travel as the guest of an individual with an Uber user \n7  account.  FAC ¶ 29.  The customer then submits a request on behalf of himself and other \n8  passengers through Uber’s mobile software application.  FAC ¶ 30.  Once Uber identifies \n9  the vehicle that will provide the customer with transportation, Uber notifies the customer \n10  via text message or through its smart phone application.  FAC ¶ 30.  The notification \n11  includes vehicle and driver identification information and an estimated time of arrival.  \na  12  FAC ¶ 30.  When the vehicle has arrived, Uber notifies the customer, and the customer and \ntr in\nur\noo 13  passengers may board the vehicle.  FAC ¶ 30.  Uber provides several different \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  transportation services in California, and UberX is one of Uber’s most cost-effective \nrts fo\niD tc 15  transportation services.  FAC ¶ 29.  Those individuals who download Uber’s mobile phone \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  application agree to Uber’s terms of service, including an agreement to submit all disputes \nS \n n\ndr 17  to binding arbitration.  Dkt. No. 25 at Exhibit A.  \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Plaintiff National Federation of the Blind of California (“NFBC”) is a nonprofit \nN\n19  association of blind Californians, which aims to achieve integration of the blind into \n20  society on a basis of equality with the sighted.  FAC ¶ 22.  Members of NFBC use UberX \n21  on Uber’s smart phone application using text-to-speech technology.  FAC ¶ 40.  \n22  Additionally, members of NFBC use UberX as guests of UberX customers, without \n23  creating their own Uber account.  FAC ¶ 43.   \n24  For example, Manveen Chahal is a NFBC member and does not have an Uber \n25  account.  FAC ¶ 43.  On May 21, 2014, Jamey Gump used the Uber mobile app to request \n26  an UberX vehicle for himself and Chahal.  FAC ¶ 43.  Both men had service animals with \n27  them.  FAC ¶ 43.  When the UberX vehicle pulled up to the curb, Gump and Chahal \n28  attempted to enter the vehicle and opened a passenger door.  FAC ¶ 43.  The UberX driver \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      2 \n\n \n1  began shouting “no dogs!” and cursed at the men.  FAC ¶ 43.  The UberX driver left \n2  without transporting Gump and Chahal.  FAC ¶ 43.   \n3  Plaintiff Michael Kelly is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFBC.  FAC \n4  ¶ 66.  Kelly travels with his girlfriend, Brooklyn Rodden, who is also blind and uses a \n5  guide dog.  FAC ¶ 66.  Rodden has an Uber account that she uses to request UberX \n6  vehicles for herself and Kelly.  FAC ¶ 66.  On September 13, 2014, an UberX driver \n7  refused to transport Rodden and Kelly because of their guide dogs.  FAC ¶ 66.  Both \n8  intend to keep using UberX transportation services.  FAC ¶ 66.   \n9  Plaintiff Michael Hingson is blind, uses a guide dog, and is a member of NFBC.  \n10  FAC ¶ 67.  Hingson does not have an Uber account and has not used UberX.  FAC ¶ 67.  \n11  On October 9-12, 2014, Hingson attended the annual state convention for NFBC in El \na  12  Segundo, California.  FAC ¶ 67.  There, Hingson met attendees with service animals who \ntr in\nur\noo 13  were being denied transportation by UberX to and from the convention hotel.  FAC ¶ 67.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  Hingson was deterred from using UberX on December 5, 2013, because he could not \nrts fo\niD tc 15  afford to be delayed by an UberX driver refusing to take his guide dog.  FAC ¶ 67.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Hingson would like to use UberX in the future, but does not believe that UberX is a \nS \n n\ndr 17  reliable source of transportation.  FAC ¶ 67.          \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Plaintiff Michael Pedersen is blind and uses a guide dog.  FAC ¶ 73.  On September \nN\n19  12, 2014, Pedersen’s wife used her Uber account to request an UberX for Pedersen.  FAC \n20  ¶ 73.  Pedersen heard the UberX driver pulled up in front of his home, but the driver \n21  refused to transport Pedersen’s guide dog.  FAC ¶ 73.  As a result, Pedersen missed his \n22  connection to a commuter shuttle and was late for work.  FAC ¶ 73.  Pedersen would like \n23  to keep using UberX without fear that he will be denied service and made late for work or \n24  other appointments.  FAC ¶ 73. \n25  Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. is a for-profit transportation network company.  \n26  FAC ¶ 27.  Defendants Rasier LLC and Rasier-CA LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of \n27  Uber Technologies, Inc. that operate within the state of California.  FAC ¶ 28.  Defendants \n28  (collectively, “Uber”) use smart phone software applications to arrange transportation  \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      3 \n\n \n1  between passengers and its fleet of drivers.  FAC ¶ 27.    \n2  Plaintiffs allege that Uber engages in discriminatory practices by permitting UberX \n3  drivers to deny access to blind individuals and their guide dogs.  Plaintiffs bring claims \n4  under (1) Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”); (2) California Unruh \n5  Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”); (3) California Disabled Persons Act (“DPA”); and (4) for \n6  declaratory relief.   \n7  The parties attended a hearing on the motion on March 3, 2015.  All parties have \n8  consented to this Court’s jurisdiction.  Dkt. Nos. 6, 22.      \n9  II.  DISCUSSION \n10  Uber brings a motion to dismiss on a variety of issues, boiling down to questions of \n11  (1) NFBC’s associational standing to sue on behalf of its members; (2) Plaintiff Hingson’s \na  12  satisfaction of standing under the deterrent effect doctrine; (3) which plaintiffs are entitled \ntr in\nur\noo 13  to bring a claim under state law theories; (4) Plaintiff Pedersen’s standing as to the \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  likelihood of future harm; and (5) whether Uber falls within the scope of the ADA’s \nrts fo\niD tc 15  regulation as a public accommodation.  The Court will first address standing challenged \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  under Rule 12(b)(1), then Uber’s motion for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e), \nS \n n\ndr 17  and finally, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  A.  Standing \nN\n19  A Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenges subject matter jurisdiction, including a \n20  plaintiff’s standing to sue, and the Court takes the allegations in the complaint as true.  \n21  Wolfe v. Strankman, 392 F.3d 358, 362 (9th Cir. 2004).  The court must determine whether \n22  a lack of federal jurisdiction appears from the face of the complaint itself.  Thornhill \n23  Publ’g Co. v. General Tel. Elec., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1979).  “A party invoking the \n24  federal court’s jurisdiction has the burden of proving the actual existence of subject matter \n25  jurisdiction.”  Thompson v. McCombe, 99 F.3d 352, 353 (9th Cir. 1996). \n26  “Whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to \n27  obtain judicial resolution of that controversy is what has traditionally been referred to as \n28  the question of standing to sue.”  Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-32 (1972).  \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      4 \n\n \n1  Standing under Article III of the Constitution has three basic elements: (1) an “injury in \n2  fact,” which is neither conjectural nor hypothetical; (2) causation, such that a causal \n3  connection between the alleged injury and offensive conduct is established; and (3) \n4  redressability, or a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. \n5  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).   \n6  “The question whether the litigant is a ‘proper party to request an adjudication of a \n7  particular issue,’ is one within the power of Congress to determine.”  Sierra Club, 405 U.S. \n8  at 732 n.3 (1972) (citing Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 100 (1968)).  When private \n9  enforcement suits “are the primary method of obtaining compliance” with a civil rights act, \n10  such as the ADA, courts must take a “broad view of constitutional standing.” Doran v. 7-\n11  Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 2008)(citing Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., \na  12  409 U.S. 205, 209 (1972)). \ntr in\nur\noCofi 13  1.  NFBC’s Associational Standing Under the ADA \n tla\nciC 14  The test for associational standing is set out in Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Com’n, 432 U.S. 333, 342 (1977): an association has standing when (1) its members would \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interest it seeks to protect are \nS \n n\ndr 17  germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.  In Hunt, the \nN\n19  Court stated that claims for declaratory and injunctive relief do not require individualized \n20  proof, thereby satisfying the third prong.  Id. at 344. \n21  NFBC meets the Hunt test for associational standing.  First, the parties do not \n22  contest that at least plaintiff Kelly has standing to sue in his own right.  Second, NFBC set \n23  out the purpose of its organization in the complaint, which is to achieve the integration of \n24  the blind into society on a basis of equality with the sighted.  FAC ¶ 22.  The Court finds \n25  this germane to the purpose of this litigation, which is to bring a private ADA enforcement \n26  suit to ensure that blind individuals have equal access to transportation services as sighted \n27  individuals.  Third, because NFBC is seeking to represent its members only in claims for \n28  declaratory and injunctive relief, its claim is within the realm of associational standing \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      5 \n\n \n1  envisioned by the Supreme Court in Hunt.  FAC ¶¶ 123-127.   \n2  Uber has presented in its briefing and at the hearing diverging case law which \n3  suggests that two factual scenarios may distinguish the current case from Hunt: (a) the \n4  presence of arbitration agreements covering some of NFBC’s membership; and (b) the \n5  prudential consideration that NFBC is not the proper party, but rather, the individuals \n6  should be tasked with representing their own claims.  Dkt. No. 25 at 10-12.  \n7  a.  Arbitration Agreements \n8  Uber argues that NFBC’s membership includes individuals who are bound by \n9  arbitration agreements with Uber.  Dkt. No. 25 at 10.  Therefore, NFBC’s suit on behalf of \n10  all its members would violate the sanctity of those agreements by permitting bound \n11  members to litigate in court via their proxy, NFBC.  Id. at 11. \na  12  The Court recognizes that “[a]n association has standing to sue or defend in such \ntr in\nur\noo 13  capacity, however, only if its members would have standing in their own right.”  Arizonans \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  for Official English v. Arizona, 530 U.S. 43, 65-66 (1977).  Uber draws the Court’s \nrts fo\niD tc 15  attention to Pa. Chiropractic Ass’n v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass’n, 713 F. Supp. 2d 734, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  744-45 (N.D. Ill. 2010), where the district court considered similar questions of whether an \nS \n n\ndr 17  association lacked standing because some members of its association were bound by \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  arbitration agreements.  There, the Court found the third Hunt factor weighed in favor of \nN\n19  individual claims because the association could not represent those members bound by \n20  arbitration agreements.  Id.  However, even under those circumstances, the Court \n21  recognized that the association would have standing to pursue claims on behalf of only the \n22  non-bound members.  Id at n.6.  Additionally, all of the members of the Pennsylvania \n23  Chiropractic Association were seeking monetary relief.  Id. at 737-38.   \n24  Here, NFBC alleges that it only brings the claim on behalf of members who would \n25  have standing (therefore, the non-bound members), and it does not seek monetary relief.  \n26  Dkt. No. 28 at 4; see generally, Ass’n Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. \n27  Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1409 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding that individual participation is not \n28  required even if there is disagreement among the organization’s members when the \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      6 \n\n \n1  organization seeks declaratory and injunctive relief).  The Court finds Pennsylvania \n2  Chiropractic Association distinguishable from this case, and thus not persuasive in \n3  establishing that an exception to Hunt should apply. \n4  b.  Prudential Considerations \n5  In addition to constitutional standing requirements, the Court must also weigh \n6  prudential considerations, inquiring whether the plaintiff seeks to protect another person’s \n7  legal rights.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984).  A few district court cases have \n8  found that an organization is not the proper party to bring a claim where the organization \n9  was “merely repeating the claims” of the individuals.  Access 123, Inc. v. Markey’s Lobster \n10  Pool, Inc., 2001 WL 920051 at *4 (D.N.H. Aug. 14, 2001); Disabled in Action of Metro. \n11  N.Y. v. Trump Int’l Hotel & Tower, 2003 WL 1751785 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2003).  In those \na  12  cases, the organization only sought to represent the only one or two individuals who were \ntr in\nur\noo 13  plaintiffs as well.  Id.  Here, NFBC has joined with three individuals and claims to \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  represent the interest of its membership at large.  NFBC is not simply standing in for one \nrts fo\niD tc 15  of its members, but rather represents a broad membership base, which it alleges has \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  sufficiently been injured by Uber.  FAC ¶ 22.  Therefore, the Court does not believe that \nS \n n\ndr 17  prudential considerations preclude NFBC’s associational standing.   \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  Uber also argues that NFBC does not have standing to sue in its own right.  Dkt. \nN\n19  No. at 7-8.  The Court declines to reach this issue because “even if the organization has not \n20  suffered injury to itself, it may have standing to assert the rights of its members.”  Warth v. \n21  Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975).  Therefore, an association need not prove injury to itself.  \n22  Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind v. Target Corp., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1191-92 (N.D. Cal. 2007).  \n23  NFBC has associational standing, so does not need to demonstrate standing to sue in its \n24  own right. \n25  2.  Hingson’s Standing Under the ADA \n26  In order to establish an injury in fact, the ADA does not require “a person with a \n27  disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or \n28  organization . . . does not intend to comply.”  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1); Pickern v. Holiday \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      7 \n\n \n1  Quality Foods Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 2002).  “Allegations that show plausible \n2  intention or desire to return to the place but for barriers to access are sufficient.”  Pickern, \n3  293 F.3d at 1138.  Interpreting Pickern, the Ninth Circuit clarified, “if a plaintiff can show \n4  either that he was deterred from visiting the accommodation on specific past occasions \n5  when he otherwise would have visited it because of the known barriers there . . . he has \n6  established an injury in fact.”  Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1041 n.4 (9th Cir. \n7  2008). \n8  In Disabled in Action, 2003 WL 1751785 at *7 n.4, the district court surveyed \n9  nationwide cases that considered the “intent to return” requirement and found that \n10  generally, “courts have held that plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief under the \n11  ADA when they have not stated an intention or desire to return . . . or have failed to show a \na  12  likelihood of discrimination should they return to that place.”  Therefore, at the pleading \ntr in\nur\noo 13  stage, a plaintiff must allege (1) actual notice of discriminatory practices; (2) specific \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  occasions when he was deterred from visiting the accommodation; (3) an intent to return; \nrts fo\niD tc 15  and (4) a likelihood of continued discrimination.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Here, Hingson alleges that “he has specific and general knowledge of the \nS \n n\ndr 17  experiences of multiple Uber passengers with service animals who have been denied \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  access.”  FAC ¶ 67.  Specifically, he alleges that during the annual state convention for \nN\n19  NFBC in El Segundo, California on October 9-12, 2014, he met “attendees with service \n20  animals who were experiencing denials when attempting to use UberX to travel to and \n21  from the convention hotel.”  FAC ¶ 67.  In addition, he lists a number of specific dates and \n22  instances when he was deterred from using UberX.  FAC ¶¶ 68-71.  Hingson alleges that \n23  he would like to use UberX on March 9, 2015 during a business trip in Sacramento, but is \n24  deterred based on his belief of continued discrimination.  FAC ¶ 72.  \n25  Uber argues that Hingson has not sufficiently demonstrated an injury in fact \n26  because he never attempted to use any Uber vehicles.  Dkt. No. 25 at 14.  In addition, Uber \n27  challenges Hingson’s ability to demonstrate “actual notice” of Uber’s alleged \n28  discriminatory practices that would be sufficient to invoke the Pickern “deterrence theory” \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      8 \n\n \n1  because not all Uber drivers turn away blind individuals and their service animals.  Id.  \n2  The Court notes that the factual scenario presented here is different than that \n3  discussed in Pickern and Doran.  Those cases envisioned physical barriers that prevented a \n4  disabled person from gaining equal access, which would be present until removed.  Here, \n5  Hingson cannot know with certainty whether an Uber driver will accept or reject him and \n6  his service animal.  However, the Court is guided by the policy emphasized in Doran.  \n7  In Doran, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that a plaintiff need only allege one instance \n8  of ADA violation to achieve standing, but could then challenge other ADA violations \n9  found in the course of discovery.  524 F.3d at 1047.  The Court noted that “a rule limiting \n10  plaintiff to challenging the barriers he or she had encountered or personally knew about \n11  would burden business and other places of public accommodation with more ADA \na  12  litigation, encourage piecemeal compliance with the ADA, and ultimately thwart the \ntr in\nur\noo 13  ADA’s remedial goals of eliminating widespread discrimination against the disabled into \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  the mainstream American life.”  Id.   \nrts fo\niD tc 15  The ADA directs this Court to relax its standard for injury in fact in order to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  discourage both piecemeal litigation and futile attempts at access.  Hingson does not need \nS \n n\ndr 17  to use Uber’s services and risk being turned away when he has knowledge that disabled \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  individuals with service animals have been turned away, and he believes there is a \nN\n19  likelihood of continued discrimination.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Hingson has \n20  alleged sufficient facts in the complaint, taken as true at the pleading stage, to demonstrate \n21  that he had actual notice of Uber’s alleged discriminatory practice and that he was in fact \n22  deterred from using Uber’s service.   \n23  3.  Unruh Act Claims and the DPA  \n24  Uber argues that NFBC and Hingson are not “aggrieved persons” under Unruh and \n25  DPA, so do not have standing to assert those claims.  Dkt. No. 25 at 18-20. \n26  Plaintiffs’ second and third claims are state law claims under the California Unruh \n27  Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 51, 52) and the California Disabled Persons Act \n28  (California Civil Code §§ 54-54.3).  FAC ¶¶ 105-119.  The Unruh Act and the DPA \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      9 \n\n \n1  incorporate ADA standards, so a “violation of the ADA also constitutes a violation of both \n2  the Unruh Act and the DPA.”  Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn’s LLC, 165 \n3  Cal. App. 4th 571, 586 (2008); Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. \n4  2007).  The Unruh Act provides declaratory and monetary relief to “aggrieved persons” \n5  who suffer from discrimination on the basis of their disability.  Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51, 52.   \n6  The DPA provides for both monetary damages and attorney’s fees.  Cal. Civ. Code §§ 54-\n7  54.3.  Therefore, a plaintiff who has standing to, and does prevail, on an ADA claim can \n8  also seek monetary relief under the Unruh Act and the DPA.   \n9  In fact, the California Supreme Court recognized that the DPA affords “greater \n10  protection compared to the ADA” because its “standing provision is broader than its \n11  federal counterpart.”  Jankey v. Song Koo Lee, 290 P.3d 187, 195 (Cal. 2012).  “Under \na  12  state law, because a plaintiff need only show he or she is ‘aggrieved or potentially \ntr in\nur\noo 13  aggrieved’ (§ 55) to seek injunctive relief, ‘virtually any disabled person can bring an \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  action to compel compliance with’ state disability access guarantees.”  Id. (quoting \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Urhausen v. Longs Drug Stores California, Inc., 155 Cal. App. 4th 254, 265 (2007)).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Notably, California courts do not require “proof that a plaintiff intends to encounter or has \nS \n n\ndr 17  been deterred from encountering a given architectural barrier” under the DPA.  Jankey, \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  290 P.3d at 195.  Although a plaintiff may have standing, he may not be sufficiently \nN\n19  injured to recover monetary damages.  Urhausen, 155 Cal. App. 4th at 265-66. \n20  It is clear to the Court that these state law statutory provisions are meant to work in \n21  harmony with the ADA, whereby a plaintiff proving an ADA violation can seek monetary \n22  recovery for (1) his actual harm, and (2) his attorney’s fees, two remedies not provided for \n23  under the ADA.  Additionally, the Court follows the reasoning of its own district that an \n24  association establishing standing under the ADA will also have standing to pursue the state \n25  law claims.  Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 1192; Coal. of Human Advocates \n26  for K9’s and Owners v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, No. 06-cv-1887 MMC, 2007 WL \n27  641197 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2007).  Therefore, the Court finds that plaintiffs NFBC and \n28  Hingson do have standing to pursue their claims under both the Unruh Act and the DPA \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      10 \n\n \n1  because they have standing under the ADA.   \n2  4.  Pedersen’s Standing  \n3  Uber alleges that Pedersen’s standing fails because his allegations are too vague.  \n4  Dkt. No. 25 at 21.  The complaint alleges that Pedersen’s wife uses her Uber account to \n5  request rides for Pedersen.  FAC ¶ 25.  Pedersen alleges that he “has been denied access to \n6  UberX taxi services multiple times because of his service animal.”  FAC ¶ 25.  \n7  Additionally, Pedersen provides an account of his September 12, 2014 attempt to use \n8  UberX where he was refused because of his service animal.  FAC ¶ 74.  Finally, Pedersen \n9  claims that he would like to continue using UberX.  FAC ¶ 74.  As noted in the discussion \n10  of plaintiff Hingson’s standing, the ADA simply requires Pedersen to allege that he intends \n11  to use the service again and a likelihood of future discrimination.  Pedersen has alleged \na  12  what is required to demonstrate standing under the ADA.   \ntr in\nur\noo 13  Therefore, the Court denies Uber’s motion to dismiss based on lack of standing.   \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  B.  Motion For A More Definite Statement \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Uber moves for an order requiring Pedersen to provide a more definite statement \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  under Rule 12(e) as to his alleged harm.  Dkt. No. 25 at 21.  \nS \n n\ndr 17  A party may move for a more definite statement when a pleading is “so vague or \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  “A \nN\n19  motion for a more definite statement attacks intelligibility, not simply lack of detail. For \n20  this reason, the motion fails where the complaint is specific enough to apprise the \n21  defendant of the substance of the claim being asserted.”  Gregory Vill. Partners, L.P. v. \n22  Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 805 F. Supp. 2d 888, 896 (N.D. Cal. 2011). \n23  Uber argues that Pedersen’s claims lack detail and that “[d]efendants cannot even \n24  determine whether he has standing to sue in the first place.”  Dkt. No. 30 at 13.  As \n25  discussed above, the Court finds Pedersen’s pleadings specific enough to establish his \n26  standing.  Therefore, the Court similarly denies Uber’s 12(e) motion.   \n27  // \n28 \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      11 \n\n \nC.  Uber’s ADA Liability \n1 \nUber urges this Court to find that it is not a public accommodation under the ADA, \n2 \nplacing it outside the scope of regulated businesses.  Dkt. No. 25 at 22-25.  \n3 \nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal \n4 \nsufficiency of a complaint.  Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  On a \n5 \nmotion to dismiss, all allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the \n6 \nlight most favorable to the non-movant.  Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-\n7 \n38 (9th Cir. 1996).  The Court, however, need not accept as true “allegations that are \n8 \nmerely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re \n9 \nGilead Scis. Secs. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  Although a complaint need \n10 \nnot allege detailed factual allegations, it must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \n11 \ntrue, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \na  12 \ntr in 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when it “allows the court to draw \nur\noo 13 \nCfi\n tla the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft \nciC 14 \nrts fo v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  When deciding whether to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) \niD tc 15 \n sir motion to dismiss, the Court generally “may not consider any material beyond the \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS  pleadings.”  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 \n n\ndr 17 \nee\ntinhtr (9th Cir. 1990).  Therefore, the question is not whether plaintiff’s assertions are factually \nUo 18 \nN\naccurate, but rather, whether taking the complaint as true, there exists a plausible legal \n19 \nclaim.     \n20 \nIf a court grants a motion to dismiss, leave to amend should be granted unless the \n21 \npleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.  Lopez v. Smith, 203 \n22 \nF.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000). \n23 \nPlaintiffs have alleged Uber is liable under the ADA under 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b), as \n24 \na “public accommodation,” or 42 U.S.C. § 12184, as a “specified public transportation \n25 \nservice.”  FAC ¶¶ 82, 91.  Uber asserts only that it is not a “public accommodation” under \n26 \nthe ADA, but does not ask the Court to dismiss the complaint as to the specified public \n27 \ntransportation service claim.  Dkt. No. 30 at n.12.  The ADA lists twelve categories of \n28 \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      12 \n\n \n1  private establishments that are considered a “public accommodation” if they affect \n2  interstate commerce.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7).  Plaintiffs allege that Uber’s operations fall \n3  under the “travel service” category, so Uber qualifies as a public accommodation.  42 \n4  U.S.C. § 12181(7)(f).  Dkt. No. 28 at 19.  The ADA does not define travel services.   \n5  In Carparts Distrib. Ctr., Inc. v. Auto. Wholesaler’s Ass’n of New England, Inc., 37 \n6  F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1994), the First Circuit reviewed a district judge’s dismissal of a \n7  complaint alleging that health care insurers constituted a public accommodation under the \n8  ADA.  There, the Court discussed the meaning of “public accommodation” and reasoned \n9  that “[b]y including ‘travel service’ among the list of services considered ‘public \n10  accommodations,’ Congress clearly contemplated that ‘service establishments’ include \n11  providers of services which do not require a person to physically enter an actual physical \na  12  structure.”  Id. at 19.  The First Circuit did not ultimately decide whether a health care \ntr in\nur\noo 13  insurer was a public accommodation, but rather found the term “public accommodation” \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  vague and concluded that at the motion to dismiss stage, “it is unwise to go beyond the \nrts fo\niD tc 15  possibility that the plaintiff may be able to develop some kind of claim under Title III.”  Id. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  at 20.  Similarly here, defendants have not cited any binding law that Uber’s service is \nS \n n\ndr 17  precluded from regulation as a “travel service” under § 12182(b).  In the absence of clear \nee\nth\nintr\nUo 18  law to the contrary, the Court finds that plaintiffs’ allegations, when taken as true, \nN\n19  demonstrate a plausible claim for Uber’s ADA liability under § 12182.   \n20  The Court denies Uber’s motion to dismiss and finds that the determination of \n21  Uber’s potential liability under the public accommodation provision of the ADA requires \n22  more factual development.  \n23  III.  CONCLUSION \n24  In conclusion, this Court is guided by two primary factors in denying the \n25  defendants’ motion to dismiss.  First, the ADA, the Unruh Act, and the DPA require the \n26  court to construe standing liberally.  Second, at the pleading stage, the Court must take all \n27  facts pled in the complaint as true and consider whether the information provided is \n28  sufficient to allege a plausible claim.  The ADA, the Unruh Act, and the DPA have granted \nCase No.:14-cv-04086-NC                      13 \n\n \n1  private citizens a broad right to enforce their mandates, and this Court has been instructed \n2  that disabled plaintiffs should not be required to engage in “futile” attempts at access.  \n3  Therefore, the Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged claims for discrimination \n4  under the ADA, the Unruh Act, the DPA, and for declaratory relief.    \n5  Uber has raised a number of concerns about the scope of the relief requested, \n6  particularly in regard to NFBC and Hingson on the state law grounds, as well as the relief \n7  sought on behalf of individuals allegedly bound by arbitration clauses.  The Court’s \n8  findings today do not preclude Uber from raising these defenses at a later stage of \n9  litigation.   \n10  Defendants have 14 days to answer the complaint.  Fed. R. Civ.
