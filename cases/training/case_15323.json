(As explained below, however, this case was resolved by guilty plea and will not be that test case.) All the cases are available in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=27\">Foreign Targeting (702, 703, 704) special collection</a>. </p><p>On January 7, 2016, Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab was charged in a criminal complaint that was unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California following his arrest. He was arrested on a federal charge of making a false statement involving international terrorism. He pleaded not guilty to that charge.  The court (Judge Sara Ellis) ordered Al-Jayab be held without bail, citing he was a flight risk and danger to the community.</p><p>In early March, the FBI requested and was granted access to Al-Jayab’s two cellphones, an iPhone 6S and a Samsung Galaxy S5. FBI agents were reportedly able to bypass the Samsung Galaxy’s security and gain access to multiple Facebook accounts operated by Al-Jayab.</p><p>On March 17, 2016, Al-Jayab was indicted by a grand jury in Sacramento in the Northern District of Illinois for attempting to provide material support to acts of violence overseas. The indictment contended that Al-Jayab gave false statements to agents from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during an interview on October 6, 2014. In the interview, Al-Jayab indicated that he never supported terrorist groups and that the purpose of his trip to Turkey was to visit his grandmother. The California indictment contended that both statements were false.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of California, Al-Jayab is a Palestinian born in Iraq, who came to the United States as an Iraqi refugee in October 2012. Between October 2012 and November 2013, while living in Arizona and Wisconsin, Al-Jayab communicated via social media with numerous individuals about his intention to go to Syria to fight for terrorist organizations. The complaint further alleged that on November 9, 2013, he flew from Chicago to Turkey and then traveled to Syria. </p><p>According to the complaint, between November 2013 and January 2014, Al-Jayab reported on social media that he was in Syria fighting with terrorist organizations.  Al-Jayab returned to the United States on January 23, 2014, and settled in Sacramento. In 2013, Al-Jayab communicated over social media with fellow U.S.-based Iraqi refugee Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan. Al-Jayab spoke to Al Hardan about weapons training, and the two discussed travel to Syria. Al-Jayab bragged about his experience fighting in Syria and promised to teach Al Hardan how to enter Syria and fight with weaponry. Al Hardan was arrested on January 8, 2016.</p><p>On April 8, 2016,  the U.S. notified the court and defendant, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1825(d) and 1881e(a) that it intended to use information \"obtained or derived from\" physical searches and \"acquisitions acquired pursuant to\" Section 702. The defendant's lawyer responded in the press that the defendant would ask the court to suppress the evidence, as unconstitutionally derived. </p><p>On July 22, 2016, the defendant filed a petition for court appointed counsel, and the court stated that this case was sufficiently complex as to warrant appointment of two attorneys to represent him. </p><p>On August 11, 2016, the defendant's attorney informed the court that he has been contacted by a Swiss journalist asking about Al-Jayab’s alleged role in an ISIS plot in Bern, Switzerland. On March 30, 2017, the government provided Swiss documents to the defendant.</p><p>On January 16, 2018, the defendant filed a petition to dismiss the indictment based on combatant immunity. The defendant’s attorneys submitted that the doctrine of combatant immunity precludes the domestic prosecution of a lawful combatant who attempted to, or engaged in, recognized hostilities. It was further argued that should the allegations in the indictment be true for the purposes of the motion, the alleged conduct is privileged because the defendant was a protected, lawful combatant as recognized by long-standing common law principles. Moreover, the defendant’s conduct was privileged under international law because the Syrian War was an international armed conflict, or more specifically an internationalized armed conflict, and the defendant was associated with Syrian opposition groups that qualify for combatant immunity under international law.</p><p>On June 28, 2018, United States District Judge Sara L. Ellis granted in part the Government’s motion for a protective order under Section 4 of CIPA. The Court also granted in part and denied in part Al-Jayab’s motion for notice of surveillance techniques used during the course of the investigation. The Court held that the Government must provide Al-Jayab with an affidavit in compliance with 18 U.S.C. § 3504. The Court denied Al-Jayab's motion (1) to suppress evidence obtained or derived from warrantless surveillance under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act; (2) for disclosure to cleared counsel and objection to secret ex parte ClPA litigation of Fourth Amendment suppression issue, (3) for discovery regarding the intelligence agencies’ surveillance pursuant to Executive Order 12333, (4) to suppress evidence obtained or derived from the physical surveillance conducted pursuant to FISA, and (5) for disclosure of the underlying FISA and § 702 materials. The redacted version of the opinion and order was made public on August 2, 2018. </p><p>On October 29, 2018, a Superseding Information was filed by the United States Attorney. In this filing, it was stated that in February 2003, the US Secretary of Treasury designated Ansar Al-Islam was a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under section 1(b) of Executive Order 13224, and in March 2004, the US Secretary of State designated Ansar Al-Islam as a foreign terrorist organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The filing further stated that between October 2012 and January 2014, the defendant knowingly provided material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization (Ansar Al-Islam), knowing that the organization was a designated foreign terrorist organization, and that the organization had engaged in, and was engaging in, terrorist activity and terrorism in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 23398B.</p><p>On October 31, 2018, the defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to the Superseding Information. The defendant voluntarily pled guilty to knowingly providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, and knowingly providing a materially false statement to federal agents in a matter involving international terrorism.  The defendant waived in open court prosecution by indictment, and consented to proceeding by information rather than by indictment. A plea agreement was entered into on November 2, 2018. It was agreed that the maximum term of imprisonment for both charges were to be 15 years. </p><p>On October 31, 2019, Judge Ellis issued a final judgment on the case. She sentenced the defendant to 5 years in prison and 20 years of parole. The case is now closed.</p>",

I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), and have been so\nemployed since February 2013. I am currently assigned to the Sacramento Field Office. I have\ntraining in the preparation, presentation, and service of criminal complaints and arrest and search\nwarrants. I have participated in numerous investigations into terrorism-related  activities and am\nfamiliar with tactics, methods, tradecraft, and techniques of terrorists and their agents. I have\nreceived training regarding counterterrorism  investigations, operations, and strategies, and have\nknowledge of various extremist groups, their ideologies, and their involvement in terrorist\nactivity. I am involved in the investigation of offenses against the United States, including\ncrimes of terrorism as set forth in Title I 8, United States Code, Section 2331, et seq.\n2. \nThis affidavit is submitted for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause to\nsupport a criminal complaint charging the subject - Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab -\n(hereinafter Al-Jayab) - with knowingly providing and attempting to provide materially false,\nfictitious, and tiaudulent statements and representations in a matter within the jurisdiction of a\ndepartment or agency of the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section\n1001 . This affidavit does not purport to set fbrth all of my knowledge of, or investigation  into,\nthis matter.\n3. \nThe facts set forth in this affidavit are based on, among other things: my personal\nknowledge gathered from participation in the investigation  of Al-Jayab; information obtained\nfrom the investigative activities of other law enforcement officers; my review of documents and\ncomputer records related to this investigation; communications  with others who have personal\nknowledge of the svents and circumstances described herein; and information obtained from\ninterviews of Al-Jayab by United States government personnel.\n4. \nCertain quotations herein are taken from draft transcripts of written communications  that\ntranspired primarily in Arabic and were translated by FBI language analysts. Additional\nquotations herein are taken from draft transcripts of recorded conversations that transpired in\nEnglish and Arabic and were translated contemporaneously with the assistance of an interpreter.\n\nUnless specifically indicated otherwise, all conversations described or quoted in this affidavit are\nrelated in substance and part only. For example, the use of an ellipsis within brackets denotes\ntext which was not included in this aftidavit for the sake of brevity and clarity. The\nconversations and other events described herein occurred on or about the ref'erenced dates. In\naddition, the identities of Al-Jayab's associates and others have been redacted by replacing\no'Individual\" \nnames with the word  followed by a letter.\n5. \nFor the reasons stated herein, I respectfully assert that there is probable cause to believe\nthat on or about October 6,2014, Al-Jayab, a person who currently resides in the United States,\ndid willfully and knowingly make and cause to be made materially false, fictitious, and\nfraudulent statements and representations  in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or\nagency of the United States, specifically the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\n(USCIS), a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and an\nagency of the executive branch, and the otfense involved international  terrorism as detined in\nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2331,a11 in violation of Title 18, United States Code,\nSection 1001.\nII. SUBJECT: AWS MOHAMMED YOUNIS AL.JAYAB\n6. \nAs confirmed by photo identification and USCIS records, Al-Jayab is a 23-year-old male\nwho currently resides in Sacramento, California. Al-Jayab was born in Iraq, and he emigrated\nfrom Syria to the United States as a refugee in October 2012. Travel, bank, and electronic\ncommunications  records establish that Al-Jayab resided in the United States from approximately\nOctober 2012 to November 2013 and again from January 2014 to the present.l He remains in\nrefbgee status to the present date, and as such, he is subject to the jurisdiction of USCIS for\npurposes of this offense.\n'  After arriving in the United States as a refugee in October 2012, Al-Jayab resided in Tucson, Arizona and\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin. He first began to reside in Sacramento, within the Eastern District of California, upon his\nreturn flonr Syria in lale January 2014,\n\nIII. \nSUMMARY OF THE INVESTIGATION\n1.  USCIS officers conducted an in-terview of Al-Jayab on October 6,2014, at the\nSacramento USCIS office, with the assistance of an Arabic language interpreter.2 Al-Jayab was\nadvised it was unlawful to provide false statements to the interviewers. Specifically, Al-Jayab\nwas placed under oath and the following statement was read to him: \"Title l8 USC makes it\nagainst the law to provide false statements to the government. If you knowingly and willfully\nprovide false information or conceal a material fact, you are subject to criminal penalties. It is\nagainst criminal law to lie or cover up information during the interview.\" Al-Jayab\nacknowledged he understood this statement.\n8.  During the October 6,2014 interview with USCIS, Al-Jayab made the following\nstatements:\na) \nWhen directed to list the countries he visited during the last time he traveled\noutside the United States, in 2013 to 2014, Al-Jayab responded that he went to Turkey,\nand from Turkey he went to Britain and returned to the United States.\nb) \nWhen asked the purpose of his trip, Al-Jayab responded he went to Turkey to see\nhis grandmother and to visit the place.\nc)  o'No,\" \nAl-Jayab responded,  to the following inquiries:\nif he had ever been a member of any rebel group, militia\" or\ninsurgent organization,\n11. if he had ever assisted any rebel group, militia, or insurgent organization,\n111. if he had ever solicited membership or funds for any terrorist group or\norganization,\nlv. if he had ever provided any type of material support to any person or\ngroup that engages in terrorist activity,\n2 \nAn FBI language analyst fluent in the traqi dialect of the Arabic language (spoken by Al-Jayab) was\navailable to and used by Al-Jayab telephonically during the interview.\n\nif he had ever called for, helped with, or committed the killing of any\nperson,\nvl. if he had ever called tbr, helped with, or committed the intentional and\nsevere injury ofany person,\nvll. if he had ever been a member of a group of any kind in which he used or\nthreatened to use any type of weapon against any person, and\nu1r. if he had ever assisted in a group where other people used or threatened to\nuse a weapon against any person.\n9. \nAs supported by the facts outlined below, there is probable cause to believe that Al-\nJayab's statements and representations  to USCIS listed above were materially false.\nIV.

Al-Jayab\nwrote, 'ol want to go back. God is my witness.

Don't go with anyone\nexcept the Front. [.. ] Go with Ansar or with the Front only.\" 4\nc) \nOn October 30,2012, Al-Jayab communicated with Individual B, who was likely\nlocated in Syria based on the content of his communications  with Al-Jayab.

Al-Jayab wrote;\n\"I was told by the young men to talk with you so that you could arrange my return.\"\nIndividual E wrote, \"You just tell us and we will do it,\" and explained that another\no \n\"Front\" is likely a reference to al Nusrah Front. According to the United States Department of Stote\nCountry Reports on Terrorism 201j, Al-Qa' ida in Iraq (AQI) was established in 2004 by long-time Sunni extremist\nAbu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, who the same year pledged lris group's allegiance to Osana Bin Laden.

On December 11,2012, the Depaftment of State amended the designation of AQI to\ninclude the al Nusrah Front (ANF)/ Jabhat al Nusrah (JAN) as aliases of AQI. The Deparhnent of State's finding in\nsupport of amending the AQI designation was that ANF and JAN committed hundreds of terrorist attacks in Syria,\n\nindividual \"told me to find out how much you need.\" Al-Jayab responded, \"Whatever\nGod enables,\" and Individual E advised, \"Make affangements with [Individual F] to send\nyou the money.\"\ng) \nOn Februar y 5,2013,A1-Jayab communicated with Individual F, who was likely\nlocated in Syria, based on his communications  with Al-Jayab.

This individual\nalso sent $450 in the name of one of Al-Jayab's associates, who, along with Al.Jayab,\nwas then residing in Arizona. Both wire transfers were received at a Western Union\nagent in Arizona. On Februar y 7 ,2013,Al-Jayab confirmed to Individual F, \"l received\nthe transfer [. . . ] the total 681 .\"\ni) \nOn March 13,2013,Individual F wrote to Al-Jayab, \"Just come to Turkey\nt \nwithout a passport and enter Aleppo from there.  Tell them you are Syrian.\" Al-Jayab\nreplied,'ol'll come with temporary American passport.\" Individual F wrote, 'oI'll show\nyou the way, because [an associate] knows someone in Aleppo and I asked him to help\nyou.\" Al-Jayab asked, o'How to enter Syrian borders if my passport is American?\" and\nIndividual F and Al-Jayab discussed various options for travel routes to Syria.\nj) \nOn March 23,2013, Al-Jayab communicated with lndividual G, who was likely\nlocated in lraq, based on his communications  with Al-Jayab. Al-Jayab wrote,'oI am\ncoming to Syria [...] I have planned a route and everything. [.. .] The most important is\nthe duty of the path.\" Al-Jayab offered, \"If you want in Iraq,I will anange it for you. I\nwill arrange it for you in Syria also.

Al-Jayab\nexplained that he wanted to travel to Turkey to enter Syria, and he asked Individual H to\npick him up at the airport. Individual H asked if Al-Jayab \"want[ed] Al-Nusra Front,\"\nand Al-Jayab responded, \"that's for sure.\" Individual H advised, \"You know those who\narrive to Syria from Turkey, most of them are citizens of Sweden and Australia and\nothers, because war is to advance and retreat. [...] Syria is one hour away from where'I\nam now and smuggling takes place in our area.\" When Al-Jayab told Individual H that he\nwould be traveling to Turkey with a United States travel document, Individual H\nreminded Al-Jayab of the importance of maintaining the ability to travel legally. Al-\nJayab proposed, \"l'll go to the American Embassy in Turkey. I will tell them that due to\ncircumstances, I can't return now.

If you arrive and I am still there, I will train you. And once you are done [training],\nI will submit a request to the person in charge so you would come and work with me.\"\nIndividual I asked, \"So they will assign me to a certain job according to my abilities,\nwhich they see,'o and Al-Jayab explained, \"No, we will make your abilities very strong.\"\nIndividual I asked, \"In your opinion, what kind ofjob [will they] assign me to?\" Al-\nJayab replied, \"Let us arrive and we will arrango there. Our concern now is only to arrive\nthere. [...] When you arrive to al-Sham [Syria] you will be trained.\"\nn)  On April 13,2013, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual I, \"O God, grant us martyrdom\nfor your sake while engaged in fighting and not retreating; a martyrdom that would make\nyou satisfied with us.\" Individual I wrote, \"lt is better if we leave together when the\nTurkish route is open, so that if we are confronted by any resistance from the enemy,\nthere is the two of us [...] I mean we would help each other.\" Individual I related that he\nlearned fiom a Syrian associate, \"He who enters illegally from Turkey to Al-Sham\n[Syria] does not have to pass through checkpoints.\"  Al-.layab wrote, \"When I arrive in\nTurkey, I will call our youth in Turkey, and they will solve the situation for me.

Sevenmagazines in one breath. [...] Just shooting, spraying,\nspraying.\" Individual I clarified, \"You mean you were there during the battle against the\nAssadists?\" and Al-Jayab confirmed,'oYes.  Certainly.\" Al-Jayab wrote, \"Brother, God\nwilling, you will be bored of shooting with guns. I have not seen anything better than the\nGlock. All my work was with the Glock and a nine Tariqs and also its silencer [...]\nOnce it hits someone, you would think the person fainted right before your eyes. It does\nnot look like you killed him.\" Individual I asked, \"Are there operations conducted with\nsilencers in Damascus?\" Al-Jayab replied,'oYes.

The third one aimed the Russian at the brother\n[...] and would not unlock the safety. He was so scared, he could not do it.\" Individual I\ninterjected, 'oGod is great! And you silenced him.\" Al-Jayab replied, \"Yes. At the time,\nthe operation was without the use of silencer [. ..] in the chest, in the head. And when he\nfalls, we shoot again.\" Al-Jayab continued, \"Do you remember the national security\nheadquarters building in Syria? The mujahidin, Al-Nusra Front struck it. [...] Those\nsuicide bombers they want to break in. There is a control checkpoint that would stop\nthem. Their call is full of ammunition and suicide vests, its booby traps were visible, so\nthey would stop them and arrest them. We got down and overran the control checkpoint\nand opened the way for them to raid, and we retreated.\" Individual I confirmed, \"You\nmean you were there during the raid?\" and Al-Jayab replied, 'oYes. Look, God is with the\nMujahidin.\"\nq) \nOn April 25,2013, Individual I wrote to Al-Jayab, \"O God please do not deprive\nme, my brothers, and my brother Aws from the blessings of Jihad in Syria,\" and asked,\nt \nIbelieve\"nineTariq\"isareferencetothelraqi-nranufacturedcopyoftheBerettaN,{1951pistol.

Al-Jayab wrote, \"I really did not want to disturb you. For some time I knew. I\ndid not want you to lbel uneasy about Jihad and be concerned with being detained.\"\n0  On June 30,2013, Al-Jayab wrote to IndividualL,':1am at the shooting club.

You and [Individual C].\"\nw) \nOn August 18, 2013, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual D,'oI have left $400 until I\ncome there. I want that you plan for me a route quickly.\"\nx) \nOn August lg,2}|3,Al-Jayab communicated with Individual M, who was likely\nresiding in Syria based on his communications  with Al-Jayab, as well as Individual M's\nsocial media account profile, which stated that he lived in Damascus, Syria. Al-Jayab\ne \nAccording tothe United States Department o/'Slate Countrlt Reports on Ten'orism 2014, Ansar al-lslanr,\nalso knowr.r as Arrsar al-Suuua among other aliases, is a Sunni ten'orisi group which has vorved to establish an\nindependent Islamic state in Iraq.

Based on\nrecords obtained via search warrant, Individual N's social media account appeared to be\nused to distribute ISIL propaganda and to communicate with individuals who are\nbelieved to be affiliated with ISIL and other terrorist organizations.r0 Individual N told\nAl-Jayab, \"May God protect you and grant success through you. [..,] Haji, keep our job\nin your mind. And think. And it is tedious a little bit. We ask God to reward you.\" Al-\nJayab responded, \"Okay. By God, I am trying.\"\nz) \nOn August 30,2013, Al-Jayab told Individual N, \"The most important thing is to\nsend me money to return. t...] I want to come. God has facilitated the work before. [...]\nI will come.\"\naa)  On September 8, 20t3,Al-Jayab wrote to Individual D, \"I am burning with desire\nto come there and work,\" after which he and Individual D discussed a photo of various\nweapons including a gray gun and Kalashnikov rifle that Individual D claimed belonged\nto Individual D. Individual D wrote to Al-Jayab, \"'When you arrive here, we will give\nyou better ones [...] along with five magazines, one of which holds 30.\" Al-Jayab\nreplied, \"I wish you will not die until I come.\"\nbb)  On Octobe r 26,2013, Al-Jayab wrote Individual N, \"Sheikh, I need a path.\"\nIndividual N replied on October 29,*I tasked [Individual D] and I will provide him with\nthe money so he would transfer it to you.\"\nTravel to Turkey and Syria\nl. \n1  The investigation  has established the following facts concerning Al-Jayab's activities\nfrom approximately  November 2013 to.Ianuary 2014.\nr0 \nAccording to the l-Jnited States Deparnnent oJ'State Country Reports ctn Terrorism 201 4 and infbrmation\npublished by the National Counterterrorism Center, AQI publicly re-named itself the Islamic State in Iraq in October\n2006. In April2013, AQI's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadiciianged the group's public nante to the lslamic Staie ol\nIraq arid the Levant (ISIL), to reflect its operational expansiori into the Syrian conflict. In NIay 2014, thc\nDepafiment olstate ameirded the FTO designation of AQI to inciude tire alias ISIL as its priutary nan.re.\nll\n\na)  In early November 2013, Al-Jayab was residing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\naccording to travel, bank, and electronic communications records. Bank records indicate\nAl-Jayab received approximately  $4,500 from an auto insurance settlement on November\n6,2013.\nb)  On November 7,2013, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual N, \"Haji, I managed to get\nmoney and everything, I do not want money from you, just find me a way, I beg you.\nMake arrangements for me, my Sheikh t...] I will be going to Turkey and it is very\nimportant that you provide me with a telephone number.\"\ne)  On November 8, 2ll3,Al-Jayab purchased an airline ticket in Chicago, Illinois.\nTravel records establish that Al-Jayab flew directly frorn Chicago to Istanbul, Turkey on\nNovember 9,2013.\nd)  Al-Jayab maintained contact with several of his family members and associates\nwhile he was outside of the United States between November 2013 and January 2014 and\nkept them apprised of his movements and wellbeing.\ne)  I have reviewed electronic communications  records of Intemet Protocol (IP)\naddresses that Al-Jayab utilized to connect to the internet to access social media and\nemail accounts during his travel to Syria. Analysis of those IP addresses and other\ninformation establishes that Al-Jayab accessed the internet in the time period at issue\nthrough a satellite that covered both eastern Turkey and areas of norlhern Syria.\n0  On November 10, 2013, Al-Jayab communicated Individual O, who was then\nresiding in Cyprus, and explained that he (Al-Jayab) was in Turkey, planned to enter\nSyria, and would be'ogoing with the Mujahidin.\"\ng) \nOn November 19, 2013,Al-Jayab informed Individual O that he fAl-Jayab] had\nsafely arrived in Syria and was in Aleppo.\nh)  On November 26,2013, Al-Jayab told Individual N (see paragraphs 10(y, z,bb)\nand 1l(b), above) that he (Al-Jayab) was in Aleppo and providecl a telephone number that\nbegan with the numbers 0992 to Indi.ridual N in orcler to contact him (Al-Jayab). Basecl\nt2\n\non publicly available intbrmation, this phone number corresponds to a Syrian telephone\nnumber,\ni)  On November 28, Z}l3,lndividual O advised Al-Jayab to avoid using his phone\nbecause it showed \"that [Al-Jayab was] writing from Aleppo.\" Al-Jayab replied, \"Okay.\"\nIndividual O wrote, \"Aws, I need you to get out of Syria as soon as possible,\" and noted\nAl-Jayab's phone'owill reveal that you are in Syria [...] and this is dangerous to your\nsituation over there.\"\nj) \nOn December 10, zll3,Individual  O informed Al-Jayab, \"It shows that you are\ntyping from Al-Hasakah.\"ll Al-Jayab responded, \"How did you know?\" Individual O\nwrote, \"l am telling you, it [is] shown to me that you are writing from Al-Hasakah,\" and\nAl-Jayab replied, \"Okay.\" Shortly thereafter, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual O, \"Forgive\nme, I might become amartyr.\"\nk)  o'afraid \nOn Decemb er 17 ,20'13, Al-Jayab told Individual O he was  of being\nimprisoned in America [because] the government is alert for everything, [and] my trip\nhere constitutes a charge.\"\nl)  On December 23,2013, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual O, ool have ml6.\" Based on\nmy training and experience as well as communications  between Al-Jayab and his\nassociates during his travel, I believe \"m 1 6\" is a reference to the M I 6 assault rifle. On\nthe same day, Al-Jayab informed Individual O that he (Al-Jayab) was returning to\nAleppo.\nm) \nOn Decemb er 25,z}|3,lndividual O told Al-Jayab to remove a picture that\n\"shows that you are wearing military uniform.\"\nn) \nOn December 28, z}l3,Al-Jayab communicated with Individual P, who was then\nlocated in Indonesia according to his communications  with Al-Jayab. Al-Jayab informed\nIndividual P that he (Al-Jayab) was in Aleppo. Al-Jayab explained that he joined Ansar\nal-Sham, \"the same as Ansar al-Islam, just with another name.\"l2 Al-Jayab continued,\n''  Al-l-lasakah is a city located in northern Syria.\n't  On December 28,2013, Al-Jayab erpressed to individual P iris understanding that, \"Ansar al-lslam and\nAnsar al-Sham have one and the same faiih and approach.\" Al-Jayab explained, \"Ansar al-Sham and tlie Ansar al-\nl3\n\n\"lt is the one that leads the new Islamic Front formed after merging with Jabhat al-\nNusrah,\" but he noted that the alliance was not publicly declared. Al-Jayab wrote, \"The\nArmy of Islam and Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Tawhid Brigade became the al-Jabhah al-\nIslamiyyah.13 When they engage in battles [they are] led by Jabhat al-Nusrah and Ansar\nal-Sham.\" Al-Jayab detailed the cooperation and 'Joint action\" that existed between\ncertain Sunni extremist groups engaged in the conflict against the Syrian regime. When\nIndividual P encouraged Al-Jayab to not \"be harsh on the State,\"l4 Al-Jayab wrote that\nthe State o'have killed many from Jabhat al-Nusrah and hundreds of mujahidin fare\ndetained] by the State.\" Al-Jayab wrote, \"I came to Syria. t...] I fight alongside.\" He\nthen expressed concern over conflict that was occurring amongst some of the Islamic\ngroups in the area: 'oBrother, this is the blood of Muslims shed at the hands of the State,\"\nand continued, oolf it weren't for the State's bloodletting, I would have been the first one\nto join it. [That's] why I joined the al-Ansar even though there's little action; the al-\nAnsar, at least they don't kill Muslims.\"ls Al-Jayab continued, \"Brother, I'lljoin al-\nNusrah shortly [...] and if any sedition arises, I'll leave my weapon and go to Turkey.\"\no)  On January 2,2014, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual O, \"I have been thinking of\njoining the State and abandon[ing] the al-Ansar.\" Al-Jayab explained he was familiar\nwith Ansar al-lslam because heooused to work with them in Iraq,\" and his \"commander\"\ncame to Syria from Iraq. Al-Jayab wrote,'oI came to him.\" Al-Jayab also asked\nIndividual O's opinion of al-Ansar.\nIslam are but one, lts Emir is Abu Hashim.\" According to the Uniled States Department of State Country Reporls\non Terrorism 2014, Ansar al-lslam is a Sunni terrorist group which has vowed to establish an independent Islamic\nstate in Iraq. Ansar al-lslam became a designated FTO on March22,2004. Abu Hashim Muhammad bin Abdul\nL \nRahman al Ibrahim became the leader of Ansar al-lslam in December 201  See also footnote 9, above. \n.\n'3  Al-Jabhah al-lslamiyyah is an Arabic phrase that franslates to \"the Islamic Front.\" According to open\nsource reporting, the Islamic Front was an umbrella organization of Sunni Salafist groups fighting to depose the\nSyrian regime and seeking to establish an Islamic state in Syria. In late November 2013, founding members of the\nIslamic Front included Ansar al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, the Tawhid Brigade, and the Army of Islam, among others.\n'o  Based on my training and experience as well as open source infomation, I believe \"the State\" is shorthand\ncommonly used to ret'er to ISIL.\n'5  Based on my training and experience as rvell as the content of Al-Jayab's electronic communications, I\nbelieveAl-Jayab'srefbrenceto\"Muslir.ns\"excludesShiaNluslinrs.  Al-Jayabref-erstoShiitesusingterirssucitas\n\"rafidah,\" meaning rejectionists or rejectors; this is a derogatory tenlr corrlrloilly used by Sunni extreurists u,irei.t\ndiscussing Shia.\nl4\n\np)  On January 6,2014,A1-Jayab wrote to Individual M (see paragraph 10(x) above),\nthat Al-Jayab was in \"Haritan, Aleppo, a fighting zone [between] the State and the Free\nArmy.\"l6 When Individual M asked if Al-Jayab was with \"the Free now,\" Al-Jayab\nreplied, \"No. Ansar al-Islam.\" Individual M asked, \"Who do they belong to?\" and Al-\nJayab replied, \"Ansar al-lslam in lraq.\" Al-Jayab discussed the infighting that occurred\nbetween various Islamic extremist goups engaged in the Syrian conflict.\nq) \nOn January 7,2074, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual P,'oBrother, we do not sit and\nwatch. [...] Our heaclquarters is next to the State exactly, and we are against the Free\nArmy. We have prevented the Free Army from entering the area and attacking the\nState's headquarters. And if the Free Army advances, we will fight it. [...] We installed\nthe DoshkaslT in the street and spread among all of our headquarters because we are at\nthe entrance of Aleppo. The Free Army is under the control of our forces.\" Al-Jayab\nconcluded, \"I swear that the State is killing [members of] al-Ansar and al-Nusrah. They\nare our brothers, but they are making a mistake. And we are going to stand with the State\nagainst the [Free Arn y].\" That same day, Al-Jayab wrote to Individual M,'oI might\nwithdraw. [...] When the seditious acts are over, I will retum. t...1 I did not come to fight\nfor the sake of sedition.\"\nC. Return to Turkey and the United States\n12. The investigation has established the following facts conceming Al-Jayab's activities\nduring approximately  January 2014.\na) \nOn January 8,2014, Al-Jayab informed Individual O the border crossing with\nTurkey was closed and he (Al-Jayab) remained in Aleppo.\nb) \nOn January 9 and 13,2014, according to telephone toll records, the Syrian phone\nnumber Al-Jayab providecl to Individual N (see paragraph 1i(h), above) was also in\nr6 \nAccordirrg to open source infbrnation, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) was established in 201 I by Syrian\nmilitary def'ectors, and it lras since become an umbrella organization for various armed opposition groups fighting to\ndepose the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Elements of the FSA liave historically stated suppofi fbr secular\ngovcn)arlce in Syria.\nt7 \nI believe \"Doshkas\" is a reference to the DShK lreavy machine guir. oi variani, con.ririonly i';ferred to as\n\"dushka\" ancl rvidell, used in the Syrian conflict.\nl5\n\ncontact with one of Al-Jayab's family members, who was then residing in Sacramento,\nCalifomia.\nc) \nOn January 17,2014, Al-Jayab informed Individual P that he would \"leave in two\nhours [for Turkey].\" Al-Jayab added, \"Once I arrive in Turkey I will call you.\" Several\nhours later that day, Al-Jayab's social media account was accessed tiom an IP address\nwhich resolved to Turkey.\nd) \nTravel records confirm Al-Jayab returned to Sauamento, California via London,\nUnited Kingdom and Los Angeles, Califomia on January 23,2014. Upon his return to\nthe United States, Al-Jayab's Customs Declaration Form made no mention of his travel to\nTurkey and Syria; \"Jordan,\" and \"U.K.\" were the only entries in the \"countries visited\"\nfield.\ne) \nMaterials gathered in the course of the investigation show that Al-Jayab made no\nretbrence to visiting his grandmother during communications he exchanged with family\nmembers or associates from mid-November 2013 to mid-January 2014.\n/\nD. USCIS and FBI Interviews\n13. \nOn July 29,2014, Al-Jayab was interviewed by USCIS in conjunction with his\napplication for adjustment of his immigration status. During that interview, Al-Jayab said that he\nhad traveled to Turkey and returned to the United States about six months earlier. Six months\nbefore was January 2014.\n14. \nAs outlined in paragraph 8, Al-Jayab was interviewed by USCIS a second time on\nOctober 6,2014.\n15. \nOn June 18, 2015, Al-Jayab voluntarily and without solicitation from the FBI, was\ninterviewed by FBI agents rbgarding problems he experienced at the airport when traveling.\nDuring that interview Al-Jayab stated he had traveled to Turkey for a vacation. He denied\ntraveling to Syria.\nl6\n\n16. \nThe tbregoing establishes probable cause to believe that Al-Jayab lied during his\ninterview with USCIS officers on October 6,2014. There is probable cause to believe that,\ncontrary to what he stated in the interview:\na) \nAl-Jayab traveled to Syria and his travel was not conlined to Turkey and Britain\nbefore returning to the United States.;\nb) \nhe went to Turkey to get to Syria and for reasons other than to visit his\ngrandmother;\nc) \nhe was a member of and assisted a rebel group, militia, or insurgent organization;\nd) \nhe solicited membership for a terrorist group or organization and provided\nmaterial support to a person or group that engages in terrorist activity;\ne) \nhe called for, helped with, or committed the killing and intentional and severe\ninjury of any person;\n0  he was a member of a group in which he used or threatened to use a weapon\n.  against any person; and\ng) \nhe assisted in a group where other people used or threatened to use a weapon\nagainst any person.\n17. \nBased on my training and experience as well as discussions with USCIS and Homeland\nSecurity Investigations (HSI) personnel, Al-Jayab's statements were material to the\ndetermination  by USCIS of Al-Jayab's eligibility for immigration benefits. If Al-Jayab admitted\nto being in Syria, USCIS would have asked additional questions and Al-Jayab's file may have\nbeen subjected to further process. If Al-Jayab admitted to supporting terrorist activities or a\nterrorist group, Al-Jayab's refugee status may have been subject to termination. In addition,\nintentional misstatements  to USCIS, if proven, could negatively impact a refugee's ability to\nremain in the United States and may subject the individual to removal proceedings or criminal\nprosecution.\nt1\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n18. \nBased on the foregoing, I respectfully assert that there is probable cause to believe Aws\nMohammed Younis Al-Jayab knowingly and willfully provided and attempted to provide\nmaterially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements and representations in a matter within the\njurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States, specifically United States Citizenship\nand Immigration Services, a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security,\nand the offense involved international terrorism as defined in Title 18, United States Code,\nSection 2331, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.\nvI. REQUEST FOR SEALING\n19.  I further request that the Court seal the arrest warrant, the affidavit, and the criminal\ncomplaint in support thereof except that copies of the warrant in full or redacted fonn may be\nmaintained by the United States Attorney's Office and may be served on Special Agents and\nother investigative and law enforcement officers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, federally\ndeputized state and local law enforcernent officers, and other govenment and contract personnel\n\\\n\\\n18\n\nacting under the supervision of such investigative or law enforcement officers, as necessary to\neffectuate the warrant. These documents pertain to and discuss an ongoing crirninal\ninvestigation that is neither public nor known to all the talgets of the investigation  at this tiine.\nAccordingly,  there is good cause to seal these documents because their premature disclosure may\nseriously jeopardize the investigation.  Sealing these documents will also better ensure the safety\nof agents and others.\nEliZabeth Buckrniller\nSpecial Agent, FBI\nSUBSCRIBED and SWORN to before me\nLTNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nt9",

      "text": "Sacramento Man Arrested for Terrorism Offense \nU.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of California \nThursday, January 7, 2016 \nhttp://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/sacramento-man-arrested-terrorism-offense  \n \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. — A Sacramento resident was arrested today on a federal charge of making a \nfalse statement involving international terrorism. Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, 23, is charged in a \ncriminal complaint that was unsealed today in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California \nfollowing his arrest. He is in custody and will be making an initial appearance Friday in federal court in \nSacramento at 2:00 PM. \n \nThe arrest was announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin, United \nStates Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner of the Eastern District of California, and Special Agent in Charge \nMonica M. Miller of the FBI’s Sacramento Division. \n \n“Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab allegedly traveled overseas to fight alongside terrorist organizations \nand lied to U.S. authorities about his activities,” said Assistant Attorney General Carlin. “The National \nSecurity Division’s highest priority is protecting the nation from terrorism, and we will continue to hold \naccountable those who seek to join or aid the cause of terrorism, whether at home or abroad.” \n \n“According to the allegations in the complaint, the defendant traveled to Syria to take up arms with \nterrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities,” said U.S. Attorney \nWagner. “While he represented a potential safety threat, there is no indication that he planned any acts of \nterrorism in this country. I commend the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force for their dedicated work on this \nmatter.” \n \n“In today’s complex terrorism environment, our Joint Terrorism Task Force plays an important role in \ncombating the threat of terrorism. The collaboration is stronger than ever and essential to protect our \ncommunities from harm,” said Special Agent in Charge Monica M. Miller of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation Sacramento Field Office. “The public plays an equal, if not more important, role in protecting \nthe community. We encourage those who encounter individuals who express an intent to do harm or \nclaim allegiance to a terrorist group—whether in person or online—to voice their concerns to law \nenforcement.” \n \nAccording to the complaint, Al-Jayab is a Palestinian born in Iraq, who emigrated from Syria to the United \nStates as a refugee in October 2012. Between October 2012 and November 2013, while living in Arizona \nand Wisconsin, he communicated over social media with numerous other individuals about his intent to \nreturn to Syria to fight for terrorist organizations. In those communications, according to the complaint, Al-\nJayab discussed his previous experience with firearms and with fighting against the regime in Syria. On \nNov. 9, 2013, he flew from Chicago to Turkey, and then traveled to Syria. Between November 2013 and \nJanuary 2014, Al-Jayab allegedly reported on social media that he was in Syria fighting with various \nterrorist organizations, including Ansar al-Islam, a designated foreign terrorist organization since 2004. He \nreturned to the United States on Jan. 23, 2014, and settled in Sacramento. \n \nThe complaint alleges that on October 6, 2014, Al-Jayab was interviewed by U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services and responded in the negative to numerous questions, including whether he had \never been a member of any rebel group or militia; whether he had ever provided material support for any \nperson or group engaged in terrorist activity; and whether he had ever been a member of a group, or \nassisted in a group, which used or threatened the use of weapons against others. Al-Jayab also allegedly \nstated during the interview that he had traveled to Turkey in late 2013 and early 2014 to visit his \ngrandmother. The complaint alleges that all of those answers were materially false. \n \nIf convicted, Al-Jayab faces a maximum statutory penalty of eight years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \nAny sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any \napplicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of \nvariables. \n\n \nThe charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThis case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Sacramento \nJoint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), a team of federal, state, and local law enforcement agents and \nofficers investigating domestic and international terrorism. Assistant United States Attorney Jill Thomas \nand Trial Attorney Andrew Sigler of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section are \nprosecuting the case. The investigation is ongoing. \n \nUSAO - California, Eastern \nNational Security & Homeland Security \nDownload criminal_complaint.pdf (1.1 MB) http://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/file/811711/download  \nUpdated January 7, 2016 \n ",

The\ngovernment filed.an ex pirte, in cameramotion for a protective order pursuant to Section 4 of\nthe Classified hformation Procedues Act (\"CIPA\") and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n16(dxl) to authorize the government to withhoid classified documents from alJayab [55]. fhe\n.government also seeks a finding that the physical search at issue in this case was lawfully\nauthorized and conducted in compiiance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\n(\"FiSA') and a denial ofal-Jayab's motion to suppress. Al-Jayab has filed the foliowing:\n(.1) motion to suppress evidence obtained or tierived from warrantless surveillance under Section\n702 of the FISA Amendrnenrs Acr (\"TAA\").' 50 U.S.C, g IB8la p7); (2) objection to secrer er\nparte CWA litigation of Fourth Arnendment suppression issues and motion for disclosure to\nI Al-Jayab refers to $ 702 of the FAA.

Itnow sets forth its detailed rulinfs on each of the pending motions below.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Factual Background3\nAl-Jayab was born in Iraq. He moved to Syria with his family in March 2012 and then\nanived in the United States as a refugee in October ZO1Z. lnitiatly upon arriving in the United\nStates, he lived in Tucson, Arizor.a and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nAlmost immediateiy after his arrival in the United States, al-Iayab indicated to family\nrnembers and others that  intended to retum to Syria, using Turkey as a potential transit point.\n!e \nIn his communications on Facebook with various individuals, al-Jayab stated that he wanted to\nwork with Ansar al-lslam or the al-Nusra Fron! making specific plans to do so.a AI-Jayab '\nexplained to an associate that he joined the mujahidin when he was sixteen and fought for the.\ngroup now known as Ansar al-Islam. He spoke of his prior experience fighting in Syria, sending\n2 Al-Jayab has also filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on combatant immunigr [91], which the\nparties are currenily briefing. The Court does not address this motion heni, althotrgh it takes al-Jayab's\narguments into account in dete.rmining whether evidence tlre government'seeks to withhold pursuant to\nCIPA $ 4 would be relevant or helpful to al-Jayab's stated intention to pursus a combatant immunity\ndefense.\n3 The Court draws much of the factual background from the criminal complaint filed in Unitecl States v.\n. al-Jayab,No.  l6'CR 08, Doc. 1 (8.D. Cal, Jan 6,2016).\na The'Unitpd States has desiguated both Ansar al-lslam and the al-Nusra Front as foreign terrorist\norganizations (\"FTOs\") pursuant to Section 219 of the lmniigration and Nationalrty Act.\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 115 Filed: 06/28/18 Page 3 of 84 PageID #:994\nphotographs of himself with various weapons and at a gun range in Wisconsin. Al-Jayab also\ncommruricated with Abu 'Akkab al-Muhajir, who was based in Syria and used his Facebook\naccount to distribute propaganda for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (.'isir--).t Al-Jayab\nrequested money from al-Muhajir to travel to Syria, and al-Muhajir indicated he would make\narrangements to provide al-Jayab with the needed frurds.\nOn Novemb er 6,2Ol3,al-Jayab received an auto insurance seftlement. The following\nday, al-Jayab wrote to al-Muhajir, indicating that he no longer ne'eded money for his travels and\ninstead wouid only n\"\"i help once he arrived in Turkey. Al-jayab then purchased an aiiline\nticket ori November 8, flying directly from Chicago to Istanbul, Turkey on November 9.\nAnalysis of the intemet protocol (\"IP\") ad,d,resses al-Jayab'used. to access Facebook, his email\naccounts, and. other communications irnply that he was in Syria from November 2013 through\n'January 2.014, l.nthese.communications, al-.Iayab told his brother hp would be entering Syria\nwith the mujahidin and indicated he ha?i an assault rifle. His brother advised him in one message\nto remove a picture from facebook that showed him wearing a military uniform. Although al-\nJayab discussed infighting among certain Sunni extremist groups in.Syria, he suggested that he\nhad joined in the fighting against the Free Army. Al-Jayab represents in his filings that while he\nwas in Syria, he fought with Ansar al-Sham, a group that is not a designated FTO, and which\njoined with other groups tmder the umbrella bf the islamic Front to fight against Bashar al-Assad\nand his regime.6\n5 Tlre U.S.'.S.cretary of State.designated  al Qaida in Jraq as arr FTO in 2004. ln 20 14, the government\namended tlre designation to include the alias \"lslamic State of.lraq and the Levant\" (or ISIL) as its\npflmary name.\n6 Similar to Ansar al-Sham, the govefllment has not designated tlre Islamic Front as an FTO. \n.\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 115 Filed: 06/28/18 Page 4 of 84 PageID #:995\nOn January lT, 2Ol4,IP address records denionstrate that a1-Jayab left Syria and entered\nTurkey. On January 23,2014,a1-Jayab returned to Sacramento, Califqrnia.by way of London\nand Lcis Angeles. In his customs declaration form, he did not mention traveling to Turkey or\nSyria, listing only Jordan and the United Kingdom as the countries he visited during his time\nabroad.\n. \n. On July 29,2014, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\")\nemployees interviewed al-Jayab in ionnection with his apptication for an adjustment of his\nimmigration stptus. At-Jayab admitted in that interview that he had traveied to Turkey and\nreturned approximately six months before the interview, i.e., rn January 2014. Al-Jayab had\nanother interview with USCIS on October 6,2}14,during which he denied any terrorist\n:\naffiliations and indicated that he went to Turkey to visit his grandmother.  On June 18, 2015, aI-\nJayab met with Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI\") agents at his request regarding issues he\nexperienced at the airport while traveling. FIe stated during {his meeting that he traveled to\nTurkey for vacation but denied. having entered Syria.\nU. \nProcedural flistory\nThe government represents that its investiga tion of al-Jayab began in or around February\n20t4\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 115 Filed: 06/28/18 Page 5 of 84 PageID #:996\nUltimately, on January 7;2016, officials arrested ai-Jayab in the Eastern District of\nCalifornia.pursuant to a federhl criminal compiaint filed in that district, charging him with\nproviding materially false statements to federal agents in a matter involving international\ntenorism in violation of I8 U.S.C. $ i001.

HERMAN, is made pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and is governed in part by Rule 11(c)(1)(C), as more fully\nset forth below. The parties to this Agreement have agreed upon the following:\nCharges in This Case\n2. \nThe superseding information in the Northern District of Illinois (16 CR\n1\"81) charges defendant with knowingly providing material support to a foreign\nterrorist organization, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 23398 (the\n\"Chicago Case\").

Defendant has read the charges against him contained in the\nsuperseding information filed in the Chicago Case and the indictment filed in the\nSacramento Case, and those charges have been fully explained to him by his attorney.\n4. \nDefendant fully understands the nature and elements of the crimes with\nwhich he has been charged.\nCharges to Which Defendant Is Pleading Guilty\n5. \nBy this Plea Agreement, defendant agrees to enter a voluntary plea of\nguilty to the superseding information filed in the Northern District of Illinois, which\ncharges defendant with knowingly providing material support to a foreign terrorist\norganization, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 23398; and the\nindictment filed in the Eastern District of California, which charges defendant with\nknowingly providing a materially false statement to federal agents in a matter\ninvolving international terrorism, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section\n1001(aX2).\nFactual Basis\n6.  Defendant will plead guilty because he is in fact guilty of the charges\ncontained in the Northern District of Illinois superseding information and the\nEastern District of California indictment. In pleading guilty, defendant admits the\nfollowing facts and that those facts establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 3 of 20 PageID #:1104\na. \nWith respect to the Chicago Case:\nBeginning no Iater than in or about October 2012, and continuing until on or\nabout January 23, 2014, at Chicago, in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern\nDivision, and elsewhere, defendant knowingly provided material support and\nresources, namely personnel, to a foreign terrorist organization, namely Ansar Al-\nIslam, knowing that the organization was a designated foreign terrorist organization,\na\ng.//AlW{\nr**€*ism \nMore specifically, beginning in or around October 20L2, defendant began\nplanning to travel to Syria to support Ansar Al-Islam, identified Turkey as a probable\ntransit point, and sought to arrange the finances and logistics for his travel. From in\nor about October 20L2 through November 2013, defendant communicated with\nnumerous friends and family members residing in the United States and outside the\nUnited States in order to arrange and finance his travel to Syria. For example, on\nOctober L3,2012, defendant told Individual A, an associate located in Iraq, \"I want\ntogoback...I'IlgotoTurkeyandentersmuggledtoSyria...Whenlcome,  I'llcall.\nDon't go with anyone except the Front. t. . .l Go with Ansar [Al-Islam] or with the [Al\nNusral Front only.\"\nDefendant also communicated with friends residing inside and outside the\nUnited States about training to fight with groups in Syria. For example, on or about\nApril 9,2013, defendant and his Facebook friend Omar Al-Hardan, who was residing\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 4 of 20 PageID #:1105\nin Texas, discussed their plans to travel from the United States to Syria to frght with\nterrorist organizations. Defendant promised to train Al-Hardan when they arrived in\nSyria, including on how to use firearms, such as Glock pistols and ML6 assault rifles,\nand expressed his commitment to jihad, writing, \"O God, grant us martyrdom for your\nsake while engaged in fighting and not retreating; a martyrdom that would make you\nsatisfied with us.\"\nOn or about November 9, 20L3, defendant flew from Chicago to Istanbul,\nTurkey. Soon thereafter, defendant traveled to Syria. While in Syria, defendant\nioined and fousht with Ansar Al-Sham and Ansar ng that Ansar Al-\nffiaJ3^e-m \nlslam  terronst ac\nOn or about January 23,2014, defendant left Syria and returned to the United\nStates, via Turkey and the United Kingdom. Upon his return to the United States,\ndefendant's Customs Declaration Form made no mention of his travel to Turkey and\nSyria; \"Jordan,\" and \"IJ.K.\" were the only entries in the \"countries visited\" field.\nAt the time defendant engaged in the conduct set for the above, he knew\nAnsar Al-Islam was a designated foreign terrorist organization,\nir_\nb. \nWith respect to the Sacramento Case:\nOn or about October 6,20L4, in the County of Sacramento, within the Eastern\nDistrict of California, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch of\nthe Government of the United States, to wit: the United States Citizenship and\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 5 of 20 PageID #:1106\nImmigration Services (USCIS), a component of the United States Department of\nHomeland Security, defendant did knowingly and willfully make materially false,\nfraudulent, and fictitious statements and representations, an offense involving\ninternational terrorism.\nMore specifically, oo or about October 6, 2014, defendant was interviewed by\nUSCIS agents in connection with his application for adjustment of his immigration\nstatus. During that interview, when directed to list the countries he visited during\nthe last time he traveled outside the United States in 2013-20t4, defendant\nresponded that he went to Turkey, and from Turkey he went to Britain and returned\nto the United States. This response was false because, as defendant then and there\nwell knew, he traveled to Syria in 2013-2014, and his travel was not confined to\nTurkey and Britain before returning to the United States. When asked the purpose\nof that trip, defendant responded that he went to Turkey to see his grandmother and\nto visit the place. This response was false because, as defendant then and there well\nknew, he went to Turkey in order to get to Syria and did not have a grandmother\nliving in Turkey.\nIn addition, during the interview, defendant denied (1) having ever been a\nmember of or assisting a rebel group, militia, or insurgent organization; and\n(2) providing any type of material support to any person or group that engaged in\nterrorist activity. Defendant's denials were false because, as defendant then and\nthere well knew, he was a member of and provided material support to Ansar Al-\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 6 of 20 PageID #:1107\nSham and the foreign terrorist organization Ansar Al-Islam while he was in Syria\nbetween on or about November L9,20t3, and on or about January 17 ,20L4.\nDefendant statements were material to the determination by USCIS of his\neligibility for immigration benefits.\nMaximum Statutory Penalties\n7.  Defendant understands that the charges to which he is pleading guilty\ncarry the following statutory penalties:\na.  The Chicago Case carries a maximum sentence of 15 years of\nimprisonment, a maximum fine of $250,000, and a life term of supervised release.\nb.  The Sacramento Case carries a maximum sentence of 8 years of\nimprisonment,  a maximum fine of $250,000, and a term of supervised release of not\nmore than 3 years.\nc. \nPursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013, defendant\nwill be assessed $100 on each count to which he has pled guilty, in addition to any\nother penalty imposed.\nd.  Therefore, under the charges to which defendant is pleading\nguilty, the total maximum sentence is 23 years of imprisonment. In addition,\ndefendant is subject to a total maximum fine of $500,000, a life term of supervised\nrelease, and special assessments totaling $200.\n6\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 7 of 20 PageID #:1108\nSentencing Guidelines Calculations\n8.  Defendant understands that in determining a sentence, the Court is\nobligated to calculate the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, and to consider\nthat range, possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, and other\nsentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. $ 3553(a), which include: (i) the nature and\ncircumstances  of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\n(ii) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote\nrespect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, afford adequate\ndeterrence to criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the\ndefendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational orvocational training,\nmedical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (iii) the\nkinds of sentences available; (iv) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\namong defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar\nconduct; and (v) the need to provide restitution to any victim of the offense.\n9.  For purposes of calculating the Sentencing Guidelines, the parties agree\non the following points:\na.  Applicable Guidelines. The Sentencing Guidelines to be\nconsidered in this case are those in effect at the time of sentencing. The following\nstatements regarding the calculation of the Sentencing Guidelines are based on the\nGuidelines Manual currently in effect, namely the November 2016 Guidelines\nManual.\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 8 of 20 PageID #:1109\nb. Offense Level Calculations.\n18 U.S.C. $ 23398\ni.  The base offense level is 26, pursuant to Guideline\ng 2M5.3(a).\nii.

The offense level is increased by 12 levels, pursuant to\nGuideline $ 3A1.4(a), because the offense is a felony that involved a federal crime of\nterrorism as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section Zg32b(il(5), namely, the\noffense: (1) was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by\nintimidation and coercion, and to retaliate against government conduct; and (2) was\na violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 23398.\nrv. The total offense level for the violation of 18 U.S.C. $ 23398\nis 40.\n18 U.S.C. $ 1001(aX2)\nv.  The base offense level is t4, pursuant to Guideline\n$ 2J1.2(a), because the offense involved obstruction of justice of a matter related to\ninternational terrorism.\n8\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 9 of 20 PageID #:1110\nvl. Pursuant to Guideline $ 2J1.2(b)(l)(C), the offense level is\nincreased by 12levels because defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. $ 1001, and\nthe statutory maximum term of 8 years of imprisonment  applies because the matter\nrelates to international terrorism.\nvu. The total offense level for the violation of 18 U.S.C.\n$ 1001(a)(2) is 26.\nGrouping\nvltl. Pursuant to Guideline $ 3D1.2(c), the offenses are grouped\nbecause the $ 23398 charge embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense\ncharacteristic in the guideline applicable to the $ 1001(a)(2) conduct, namely because\nthe offense involved a matter related to international terrorism.\ntx. Pursuant to Guideline $ 3D1.3(a), the offense level\napplicable to the Group is 40, because it is the offense level for the most serious of the\ncharges comprising the Group.\nAcceptance of Responsibilit],\nx.  Defendant has clearly demonstrated a recognition and\naffirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct. If the\ngovernment does not receive additional evidence in conflict with this provision, and\nif defendant continues to accept responsibility for his actions within the meaning of\nGuideline $ 3E1.1(a), including by furnishing the United States Attorney's Office and\nthe Probation Office with all requested financial information relevant to his ability to\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 10 of 20 PageID #:1111\nsatisfr any fine that may be imposed in this case, a two-level reduction in the offense\nlevel is appropriate.\nxi. \nIn accord with Guideline $ 3E1.1(b), defendant has timely\nnotified the government of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting\nthe government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the Court to allocate its\nresources efficiently. Therefore, as provided by Guideline $ 3E1.1(b), if the Court\ndetermines the offense level to be L6 or greater prior to determining that defendant\nis entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the government\nwill move for an additional one-level reduction in the offense level.\nc.  Criminal History Category. With regard to determining\ndefendant's criminal history points and criminal history category, based on the facts\nnow known to the government, defendant's criminal history points equal zero.\nPursuant to Guideline $ 3A1.4(b), defendant's criminal history category is VI because\nthe offense is a felony that involved a federal crime of terrorism.\nd.  Anticipated Advisory Sentencing Guidelines Range.\nTherefore, based on the facts now known to the government,  the anticipated offense\nlevel is 37, which, when combined with the anticipated criminal history category of\nVI, results in an anticipated advisory sentence of 276 months' imprisonment,\npursuant to Guidelines $ 5G1.1(a), in addition to any supervised release and fine the\nCourt may impose.\n10\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 11 of 20 PageID #:1112\ne.  Defendant and his attorney and the government acknowledge\nthat the above guidelines calculations are preliminary in nature, and are non-binding\npredictions upon which neither party is entitled to rely. Defendant understands that\nfurther review of the facts or applicable legal principles may lead the government to\nconclude that different or additional guidelines provisions apply in this case.\nDefendant understands that the Probation Office will conduct its own investigation\nand that the Court ultimately determines the facts and law relevant to sentencing,\nand that the Court's determinations govern the final guideline calculation.\nAccordingly, the validity of this Agreement is not contingent upon the probation\nofficer's or the Court's concurrence with the above calculations, and defendant shall\nnot have a right to withdraw his plea on the basis of the Court's rejection of these\ncalculations.\n10. \nBoth parties expressly acknowledge that this Agreement is not governed\nby Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(B), and that erors in applying or interpreting any of the\nsentencing guidelines may be corrected by either party prior to sentencing. The\nparties may correct these errors either by stipulation or by a statement to the\nProbation Office or the Court, setting forth the disagreement regarding the applicable\nprovisions of the guidelines. The validity of this Agreement will not be affected by\nsuch corrections, and defendant shall not have a right to withdraw his plea, nor the\ngovernment the right to vacate this Agreement, on the basis of such corrections.\n11\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 12 of 20 PageID #:1113\nAgreements Relating to Sentencing\n1,1. This  Agreement will  be  governed, in  part, \nby\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). That is, the parties have agreed that the maximum term\nof imprisonment in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons in total for both charges shall\nbe 15 years. Other than the agreed maximum term of imprisonment, the parties have\nagreed that each party is free to recommend whatever sentence it deems appropriate;\nthe Court remains free to impose the sentence it deems appropriate, subject to the\nmaximum total term of 15 years of imprisonment. If the Court accepts the agreed\nmaximum term of incarceration set forth herein, defendant may not withdraw this\nplea as a matter of right under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d) and (e). If, however, the Court\nrefuses to the agreed maximum term of incarceration set forth herein, thereby\nrejecting this Agreement, or otherwise refuses to accept defendant's plea of guilty,\neither party has the right to withdraw from this Agreement.\n12. \nDefendant agrees to pay the special assessment of $ZOO at the time of\nsentencing with a cashier's check or money order payable to the Clerk of the U.S.\nDistrict Court.\nAcknowledgrnents  and Waivers Regarding Plea of Guilty\nNature of Agreement\n13.  This Agreement is entirely voluntary and represents the entire\nagreement between the United States Attorney and defendant regarding defendant's\ncriminal liability the Chicago Case and the Sacramento Case.\nL2\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 13 of 20 PageID #:1114\n14.  This Agreement concerns criminal liability on1y. Except as expressly set\nforth in this Agreement, nothing herein shall constitute a limitation, waiver, or\nrelease by the United States or any of its agencies of any administrative or judicial\ncivil claim, demand, or cause of action it may have against defendant or any other\nperson or entity. The obligations of this Agreement are limited to the United States\nAttorney's Offices for the Northern District of Illinois and the Eastern District of\nCalifornia and cannot bind' any other federal, state, or local prosecuting,\nadministrative, or regulatory authorities, except as expressly set forth in this\nAgreement.\n1,5. After sentence has been imposed on the Chicago Case and the\nSacramento Case, to which defendant pleads guilty as agreed herein, the government\nwill move to dismiss the indictment filed in the Northern District of Illinois.\nWaiver of Rights\n16.  Defendant understands that by pleading guiltSr he surrenders certain\nrights, including the following:\na.  Right to be charged by indictment. Defendant understands\nthat he has a right to have the charge prosecuted by an indictment returned by a\nconcurrence of twelve or more members of a grand jury consisting of not less than\nsixteen and not more than twenty-three members. By signing this Agreement,\ndefendant knowingly waives his right to be prosecuted by indictment and to assert at\n13\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 14 of 20 PageID #:1115\ntrial or on appeal any defects or errors arising from the information, the information\nprocess, or the fact that he has been prosecuted by way of information.\nb.  Trial rights. Defendant has the right to persist in a plea of not\nguilty to the charges against him, and if he does, he would have the right to a public\nand speedy trial.\nThe trial could be either a jury trial or a trial by the judge\nsitting without a jury. However, in order that the trial be conducted by the judge\nsitting without a jury, defendant, the government, and the judge all must agree that\nthe trial be conducted by the judge without a jury.\nii.  If the trial is a jury trial, the jury would be composed of\ntwelve citizens from the district, selected at random. Defendant and his attorney\nwould participate in choosing the jury by requesting that the Court remove\nprospective jurors for cause where actual bias or other disqualification is shown, or\nby removing prospective jurors without cause by exercising peremptory challenges.\n1tl. If the trial is a jury trial, the jury would be instructed that\ndefendant is presumed innocent, that the government has the burden of proving\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury could not convict him\nunless, after hearing all the evidence, it was persuaded of his guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt and that it was to consider each charge separately. The jury would\nhave to agree unanimously as to each count before it could return a verdict of guilty\nor not guilty as to each charge.\nt4\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 15 of 20 PageID #:1116\nlV. If the trial is held by the judge without a jury, the judge\nwould find the facts and determine, after hearing all the evidence, and considering\neach count separately, whether or not the judge was persuaded that the government\nhad established defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\nv.  At a trial, whether by a jury or a judge, the government\nwould be required to present its witnesses and other evidence against defendant.\nDefendant would be able to confront those government witnesses and his attorney\nwould be able to cross-examine them.\nvi.  At a trial, defendant could present witnesses and other\nevidence in his own behalf. If the witnesses for defendant would not appear\nvoluntarily, he could require their attendance through the subpoena power of the\nCourt. A defendant is not required to present any evidence.\nvu. At a trial, defendant would have a privilege against self-\nincrimination so that he could decline to testifr, and no inference of guilt could be\ndrawn from his refusal to testifu. If defendant desired to do so, he could testi$r in his\nown behalf.\nc.  Waiver of appellate and collateral rights. Defendant further\nunderstands he is waiving all appellate issues that might have been available if he\nhad exercised his right to trial. Defendant is aware that Title 28, United States Code,\nSection L291, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742, afford a defendant the\nright to appeal his conviction and the sentence imposed. Acknowledging this,\n15\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 16 of 20 PageID #:1117\ndefendant knowingly waives the right to appeal his conviction, any pre-trial rulings\nby the Court, and any part of the sentence (or the manner in which that sentence was\ndetermined), including any term of imprisonment and fine within the maximums\nprovided by law, and including any order of forfeiture, in exchange for the concessions\nmade by the United States in this Agreement. In addition, defendant also waives his\nright to challenge his conviction and sentence, and the manner in which the sentence\nwas determined, in any collateral attack orfuture challenge, includingbut not limited\nto a motion brought under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255. The waiver in\nthis paragraph does not apply to a claim of involuntariness or ineffective assistance\nof counsel, nor does it prohibit defendant from seeking a reduction of sentence based\ndirectly on a change in the law that is applicable to defendant and that, prior to the\nfiling of defendant's request for relief, has been expressly made retroactive by an Act\nof Congress, the Supreme Court, or the United States Sentencing Commission.\n17.  Defendant understands that by pleading guilty he is waiving all the\nrights set forth in the prior paragraphs, with the exception of the appellate rights\nspecifically preserved above. Defendant's attorney has explained those rights to him,\nand the consequences  of his waiver of those rights.\nPresentence Investigation ReportlPost-Sentenee Supervision\n18.  Defendant understands that the United States Attorney's Office in its\nsubmission to the Probation Office as part of the Pre-Sentence Report and at\nsentencing shall fully apprise the District Court and the Probation Office of the\n16\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 17 of 20 PageID #:1118\nnature, scope, and extent of defendant's conduct regarding the charges against him,\nand related matters. The government will make known all matters in aggravation\nand mitigation relevant to sentencing.\n19.  Defendant agrees to truthfully and completely execute a Financial\nStatement (with supporting documentation) prior to sentencing, to be provided to and\nshared among the Court, the Probation Office, and the United States Attorney's\nOffice regarding all details of his financial circumstances, including his recent income\ntax returns as specified by the probation officer. Defendant understands that\nproviding false or incomplete information, or refusing to provide this information,\nmay be used as a basis for denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility\npursuant to Guideline $ 381.1 and enhancement  of his sentence for obstruction of\njustice under Guideline $ 3C1-.L, and may be prosecuted as a violation of Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 1001 or as a contempt of the Court.\n20.  For the purpose of monitoring defendant's compliance with his\nobligations to pay a fine during any term of supervised release or probation to which\ndefendant is sentenced, defendant further consents to the disclosure by the IRS to\nthe Probation Office and the United States Attorney's Office of defendant's individual\nincome tax returns (together with extensions, correspondence, and other tax\ninformation) filed subsequent to defendant's sentencing, to and including the final\nyear of any period of supervised release or probation to which defendant is sentenced.\nDefendant also agrees that a certifred copy of this Agreement shall be sufficient\nt7\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 18 of 20 PageID #:1119\nevidence of defendant's request to the IRS to disclose the returns and return\ninformation, as provided for in Title 26, United States Code, Section 6103(b).\nOther Terms\n21. \nDefendant agrees to cooperate with the United States Attorney's Office\nin collecting any unpaid fine for which defendant is liable, including providing\nfrnancial statements and supporting records as requested by the United States\nAttorney's Office.\n22. \nDefendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences  with\nrespect to his immigration status if he is not a citizen of the United States. Under\nfederal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including one or more\noffenses to which defendant is pleading guilty. Indeed, because defendant is pleading\nguilty to an offense that is an \"aggravated felony\" as that term is defined in Title 8,\nUnited States Code, Section 1101(a)(43), removal is presumptively  mandatory.\nRemoval and other immigration consequences are the subject of a separate\nproceeding, however, and defendant understands that no one, including his attorney\nor the Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of his conviction on his immigration\nstatus. Defendant nevertheless affirms that he wants to plead guilty regardless of\nany immigration consequences that his guilty plea may entail, even if the\nconsequence  is his automatic removal from the United States.\nL8\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 19 of 20 PageID #:1120\nConclusion\n23.  Defendant understands that this Agreement will be filed with the Court,\nwill become a matter of public record, and may be disclosed to any person.\n24.  Defendant understands that his compliance with each part of this\nAgreement extends throughout the period of his sentence, and failure to abide by any\nterm of the Agreement is a violation of the Agreement. Defendant further\nunderstands that in the event he violates this Agreement, the government, at its\noption, may move to vacate the Agreement, rendering it null and void, and thereafber\nprosecute defendant not subject to any of the limits set forth in this Agreement, or\nmay move to resentence defendant or require defendant's specific performance of.this\nAgreement. Defendant understands and agrees that in the event that the Court\npermits defendant to withdraw from this Agreement, or defendant breaches any of\nits terms and the government elects to void the Agreement and prosecute defendant,\nany prosecutions that are not time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations on\nthe date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced against defendant in\naccordance with this paragraph, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of\n19\n\nCase: 1:16-cr-00181 Document #: 129 Filed: 11/02/18 Page 20 of 20 PageID #:1121\nlimitations between the signing of this Agreement and the commencement of such\nprosecutions.\n25. \nDefendant and his attorney acknowledge that no threats, promises, or\nrepresentations have been made, nor agreements reached, other than those set forth\nin this Agreement, to cause defendant to plead guilty.\n26. \nDefendant acknowledges  that he has read this Agreement and carefully\nreviewed each provision with his attorney.
