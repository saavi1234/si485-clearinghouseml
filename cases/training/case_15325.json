    "summary": "<p>A Mexican citizen brought this complaint against the City of Highland Park, its mayor, the city manager, the chief of police and the police commander on June 14, 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. According to the plaintiff, an officer sprayed him directly in the face with pepper spray while he was detained in jail and caused him immense pain. The plaintiff argued the officer’s actions were catalyzed by racial discrimination because the plaintiff was not white. He placed this specific officer’s actions within an alleged policy of discrimination that the police chief promoted. In particular, the plaintiff claimed that the department followed a de facto policy called the “NUT Ordinance,” or “N— Up Town Ordinance,” which referred to the Chicago police tactic of limiting minorities in the traditionally white part of Chicago. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, brought this § 1983 action claiming violations of his Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiff sought declaratory relief and $3,000,000 in damages. </p><p>Several months later, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. They argued that the plaintiff failed to state a claim of a policy of discrimination. On January 23, 2002, Judge William J. Hibbler denied the motion to dismiss in part. Taking the allegations by the plaintiff to be true, the court found the possibility of a <i>Monell</i> claim, a case that allows a plaintiff to sue a city under §1983. However, Judge Hibbler granted dismissal of the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim because the Eighth Amendment does not extend protection to pretrial detainees. Judge Hibbler denied the plaintiff’s motion to reconsider or certify appeal of the order.</p><p>As the case progressed into discovery, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss, this time claiming that the plaintiff had obstructed justice. During discovery, the defendants unveiled that the plaintiff had filed the complaint under a false name. They also called for sanctions against the plaintiff’s attorney because he knew of his client’s false name when the complaint was filed. The court denied the motion to dismiss on November 12, 2002, claiming the issue of fraud against the court was narrow and the defendants were not prejudiced by the new information.</p><p>Following the second failed attempt to dismiss the case, the parties began settlement talks. On April 16, 2003, they reported to the court that the parties had reached a settlement. The settlement agreement terms were not publicly available at the time of this writing. The court dismissed the case with prejudice with leave to reopen the case on or by May 16, 2003. </p><p>On May 3, 2003, the plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. The plaintiff stated that he could not explain the facts of the case, and he did not explain the defendant’s violation of the settlement agreement in his motion. The plaintiff requested that the court court compel the defendants to comply with the settlement agreement within three days or grant the plaintiff damages. The court denied the motion to reinstate the case, but extended the leave to reopen until June 17, 2003. The plaintiff filed twice more to extend the leave. The court granted each motion, extending the final leave until October 13, 2003. The plaintiff stopped filing motions to reinstate the case in June of 2003 and the case has been closed since October 2003.    </p>",

Piallltiff, alvlexican citizen,  that while he \nwas sitting alone in a jail cell at the Highland Park Police Station, Officer Cameron sprayed pepper spray through a \nwindow on the locked cell door directly into Plaintiff's face, causing him extreme pain. Plaintiff contends Officer \nCameron intentionally and unjustifiably assaulted him because he is not Caucasian.  Plaintiff claims Officer Cameron \nacted pursuant to a municipal policy condoning racial profiling, i.e., the mistreatment of minorities before and after \narrest, and that the Official Defendants not only approved of this policy known as the \"NUT ordinance,\" but also refused \nto punish officers accused of wrongdoing.  The Official Defendants and Officer Cameron each contend the Complaint \nfails to allege a constitutional violation. However, the Court concludes the Complaint is sufficient. \nIn deciding a Rule 12(b )(6) motion, the Court accepts all well~pleaded allegations in a complaint as true. \nLatuszkin v. City of Chicago, 250 F.3d 502,504 (7th Cir. 2001). Although Plaintiff raises a§ 1983 municipal liability \nclaim, the Complaint \"need not meet any heightened pleading standard, but rather must simply set forth sufficient \nallegations to place the court and defendants on notice of the gravamen of the complaint.\" Id. See also Leatherman v. \nTarrant County Narcotics Unit, 507 U.S. 162, 168 (1993); Sherwin Manor Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. McAuliffe, 37 F.3d \n1216, 1219 (7th Cir. 1994). In light of the liberal notice pleading requirement of the Federal Rules, dismissal is \nwarranted only if there is no set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint upon which relief could be \ngranted. Latuszkin, 250 F.3d at 504; Albiero v. City of Kankakee, 122 F.3d 417,419 (7th Cir. 1997). \nThe Official Defendants argue that the Complaint is deficient because Plaintiff does not allege the City of \nHighland Park had a policy of using excessive force on minorities. However, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that his \nclaims cannot be construed so narrowly. The Complaint identifies an alleged City policy of treating minorities less \nfavorably after arrest, and claims that Officer Cameron was enforcing that policy when he physically assaulted Plaintiff. \nThose allegations, if true, as the Court assumes they are for purposes of this motion, undoubtedly state a Monell claim \nagainst the Official Defendants.  See e.g., McCormick v .City of Chicago, 230 F.3d 319, 325-26 (7th Cir. 2000).  In \ntheir reply to the motion, the Official Defendants weakly suggest that the Complaint does not allege Plaintiff is a member \nof a protected group.  But the Court finds Plaintiffs general allegation that he is a citizen of Mexico against whom the \nNUT Ordinance was enforced is more than sufficient for pleading purposes to suggest that Plaintiff is indeed a minority. \nThe Official Defendants' motion to dismiss is therefore denied. \nOfficer Cameron's challenges to the Complaint are equally unavailing. First, Officer Cameron contends Plaintiff \nhas alleged no facts suggesting he was pepper sprayed because of his national origin. To state an equal protection claim, \nI ffifi[;l';f' \nPlaintiff must allege that \"a state actor purposefully dis.criminated against him because of his identification with a \nparticular (presumably historically disadvantaged) group.\"  Sherwin Manor, 37 F.3d at 1220.  The Complaint clearly \nsets forth an equal protection violation in that Plaintiff alleges he is a minority who was singled out for assault based J ~ifi~i~i>jl) \nupon Officer Cameron's anti-minority animus.  See Chavez v. Illinois State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 635 (7th Cir. 2001); \nSherwin Manor, 37 F.3d at 1221. Contrary to Officer Cameron's position, at this stage in the litigation, Plaintiff need \nonly allege discriminatory intent, not prove it. See Bennett v. Schmidt, 153 F.3d 516, 518 (7th Cir. 1998). Next, Officer \nCameron maintains, citing Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981), that Plaintiff cannot state a due process deprivation \nbecause he has adequate procedural safeguards under Illinois iaw. However, the Court agrees with .Plaintiff that Parratt, \n\"''\"''H \nwhich involved a property deprivation, is inapplicable here because Plaintiff alleges a liberty deprivation. Illinois tort  c \n4\nJaw is, therefore, inadequate. Finally, Officer Cameron argues that Plaintiff, as a pretrial detainee, has no rights under \nthe Eighth Amendment.  He is correct, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979), and Plaintiff concedes as much ~~m~f~ \nin his respons~k Nevertheless, J'laintiff also asserts that Officer Cameron's unprovoked attack on him violated his ~~ \nsubstantive due process rights'uifder the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is a cognizable claim.  See Lack v. Jenkins, \n641 F.2d 488, 494-95 (7th Cir. 1981). Accordingly, Officer Cameron's motion to dismiss is denied, exceptto the extent \nPlaintiff claims any Eighth Amendment violation. \nMoreover, the Court finds no basis for striking Plaintiffs allegations concerning \"racial profiling\" or anti \nSemitic condu~t •.  The Seventh Circuit broadly defined racial profiling as meaning \"the improper use of race as a basis \nfor taking law enforcement action.\" Chavez, 251 F.3d at 620. Thus, while Plaintiffs claim might normally be classified l:j.iji¥tti·i'•> \nas one of raciaJ(j.iscrimination, his use of the term \"racial profiling\" is also appropriate.  As for the allegations of anti \nSemitic activity by Officer Cameron, those facts are certainly relevant to Plaintiffs claim 'of discriminatory treatment l·k;;:c:;;t<::;:••:··· \nbecause he is a non-Caucasian, and thus are properly includedl...!!!~:..O J~~~~~ \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

Dahlberg \nhave moved to dismiss Plaintiff Lorenzo Rodriguez's Complaint because of his alleged fral~d on \nthe Court.  For \\he reasons discllssed below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff is a Mexican citizen who has been living and working in the United States \nillegally for several years.  Plaintiffs trlle name, which is reflected on his educational certificate \nfrom Mexico and his Mexican MilitaJ.y Registration book, is Abel Reyes.  Plaintiff, however, has \nalso used the naJ.ne Lorenzo Rodrigllez.  For example, in order to obtain employment after he \narrived in the United States, Plaintiff obtained counterfeit Social Security a1.1d Resident Alien \ncards bearing the name Lorenzo Rodriguez. \nSometime prior to June of 1999, Highland Park Police slopped Plaintiff for speeding and, \nbecause he Jacked a driver's license, arrested him.  Plaintiff claims that in connection with this \narrest, a j lldge warned him that continued speeding would result in further arrests. \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:394\nOn June 20, 1999, Highland Park Police arrested Plaintiff for drunk driving after he \ncollided with another vehicle.  Plaintifftold police his name was Luis Lopez, apparently because \nPlaintiff was concerned that the judge who had warned him after his earlier arrest would send \nhim to jail.  Plaintiff also gave false information concerning his birthday and employment status \nbecause he was concerned that the police would discover the name Luis Lopez was Hctitious. \nOn July 1, 1999, the Highland Park Police arrested Plaintiff for obstruction of justice afler \nthey discovered that he had used a fictitious name.  This lime, Plainti IT gave the police the name \nLorenzo Rodriguez.  Plaintiff also used this name when he appeared before the Lake County \nCircuit Court, which ullimately ordered that he receive two years of sLtpervision. \nOn June 14, 2001, Plaintiff llled the instant action against the City of Highland Park, \nDaniel Pierce, David Limardi, Daniel J. Dahlberg and Jeny Can1eron, asserting violations of his \nconstitutional rights under the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments.  PlaintitT alleges that while \nalone in a jail cell at the police station, Cameron sprayed pepper spray directly into Plaintiffs \nface causing him extreme pain.  Plaintiff contends that Can1eron intentionally and unjustifiably \nassaulted him because he is not Caucasian.  PlaintitT claims that Cameron acted purs•~anl to a \nmunicipal policy condoning racial profiling-- i.e., the mistreatment of minorities before and after \narrest.  He further contends that the other Defendants approved this policy and failed to punish \npolice officers accused ol'mistrcating minorities.  Plaintiff filed the action under the name \nLorenzo Rodriguez-- the name he had been using with the police when he was allegedly \nassaulted.' \n1  Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint.  On January 23,2002, Judge Hibbler \ngranted that Motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing with prejudice Plaintiffs Eighth \nAmendment claims. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:395\nWith one week left on his court-ordered supervision, on September 3, 2001, Highland \nPark Police again stopped Plaintiff lor dmnk driving.  This time, Plaintiff gave the police his true \nname, Abel Reyes.  Plaintiff claims that he provided the police with the name Abel Reyes \nbecause at the time of his arrest he was carrying either his Mexican consular registration or a \nWisconsin State Identification Card, both of which bore his true name.  Ultimately, PlaintiiTwas \nconvicted of drunk driving, and the court ordered six Jnonths ofprobation, 21 hours of school, \nand a $1210 fine. \nIn connection with the instant action, Defendants served discovery seeking, among other \nthings, infonnation concerning any names or aliases used by Plaintiff.  On March 21, 2002, \nPlaintiff served his answers to interrogatories, where he disclosed for the llrst time that his name \nwas actually Abel Reyes.  The veriilcation to Plaintifrs answers, however, was signed by \nLorenzo Rodriguez.  Some three weeks later, on April 10 and I 2, 2002, Defendants deposed \nPlaintiff, ql.lestioning him extensively about the various names he had given the authorities. \nThree days after Plaintiffs deposition, several Defendants moved to stay discovery, \nnoting that they would be moving to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for alleged identity fraud. \nJudge Hibbler denied the Motion to Stay, hut did not express any opinion on the propriety of \ndismissal in light of Plaintiffs alleged identity fraud.  (SeeR. 61-1, Dei's.' Reply Mem., Ex. C, \np. 13 (\"Okay, certainly, the defense has its right to file motions based upon discoveries that \nhappened during the course ofthe deposition in this case, but I sec no reason why that motion \nshould in any way delay the discovery in this case.\").1 \n2  Thus, Judge Hibbler never addressed the question whether Plaintiffs conduct warranted \ndismissal of his Complaint.  Plaintiffs suggestion that Judge Hibbler rejected the relief sought by \nDefendants and that \"the law of the case is that there has been no fraud\" is disingenuous. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:396\n.-\nOn September 26, 2002, Defendants Pierce, Limardi, Dahlberg and the City filed their \nMotion to Dismiss, which Cameron later joined.  On October 18,2002, Plaintiff filed a thirty-\nnine page brief\"objccting\" to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.  Although this Court's standing \nrules required that he seek leave bctbrc filing a brief in excess of fi !'teen pages, Plaintiff failed to \ndo so3  Moreover, Plaintiff compounded this error by failing to squarely address the allegations \nraised by Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.  Instead, Plaintiff's Objection wasted twenty-eight \npages on a rambling, nearly incoherent account of Plaintiffs claims against the Defendants and \nthe history of the Civil Rights statutes.  Accordingly, this Court struck Plaintiffs overlong \nObjection and directed him to file an opposition to Defendants' Motion that complied with the \nfifteen page limit and addressed the issues raised in Defendants' motion to dismiss. \nANALYSIS \nThe concept of\"fraud on the court\" has been construed very narrowly. The concept involves \na particular type or fraud which is \"directed to the judicial machinery itself.\"  l/1  the Matter (1 \nWhitney-Forbes, inc., 770 F.2d 692, 698 (7'h Cir. 1985) (quoting Bulloch v. United States, 721 F.2d \n713,718 (lOth Cir.l983)).  \"When a litigant's conduct abuses the judicial process, dismissal of a \nlawsuit is a remedy within the inherent power of the court.\" Dotson v. Bravo, 202 F.R.D. 559, 574 \n(N.D. IlL 2001) (quoting Martin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 251 F.3d 691, 694 (8'h Cir.200 1)).  The \nlaw favors a trial on the merits, however, see C.K.S. Engineers, Tnc. v_  White Mountain Gypsum Co., \n726 F.2d 1202, 1206 (7'\" Cir. 1984), and thus, tho courts' inherent power to dismiss a lawsuit as a \nsanction \"'should usually be employed only in extreme situations, where there is a clear record of \n3  This action was reassigned to this Court's initial calendar pursuant to the Executive \nCommittee's August 14, 2002 Order. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:397\ndelay or contumacious nmduct, or when other less drastic sanctions have proven unavailable.\"' \nMarrocco v. General Motors Corp., 966 F.2d 220, 224 (7'\" Cir. 1992) (emphasis in original; citations \nand quotations omitted). \nDefendants maintain that dismissal is warranted here because Plaintiff perpetrated a fraud \nupon the Court when he filed this action under a fictitious name.  Defendants suggest that Plaintiff \ndeliberately concealed his tme identity in order to gain a litigation advantage. Defendants also argue \nthat Plainti rrncvcr volunteered his tn1e name, instead providing it in only response to their discovery \ndemands.  Finally, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs attomey, Kecvan Morgan, was complicit in \nthe alleged fraud. \nDefendants argue that this case is analogous to Dotson v. Bravo, 202 F.R.D. 559 (N.D. Ill. \n200 I).  In that case, the plaintiff had sued various police officers and the City of Chicago for \nmalicious prosecution arising out ofhis arrest and prosecution following a confrontation with police. \nDotson, 202 F.R.D. at 561.  During the course of discovery in the civil action, the defendants \ndiscovered that the plaintiff had filed the action under the fictitious name \"Shaunte Dotson.\" This \nname was not a \"true alias\" because, other than the lawsuit, there was no evidence that the plaintiff \nhad ever been known as \"Shaunte Doston.\" Jd.  at 562 (citing People v. Gonzalez, 313 Ili.App.3d \n607, 613, 730 N.E.2d 534, 541 (Ili.App.Ct. 2000) (\"an alias is an additional name by which a person \nis known or identified\"). The plaintiff had volunteered the fictitious name at the time of his original \narrest because in order to conceal his criminal record under his tmc name.  Td.  at 562·63.  As \n5 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:398\nMagistrate Judge Rosemond noted, the plaintiffs use of the fictitious name gave him several \nadvantages-- for example, denying prosecutors information conceming his criminal history.  !d. at \n563. \nThe plaintiff continued to use the fictitious name \"Shaunte Dotson\" in his civil action against \nvarious police officers and the City of Chicago. For example, the plaintiff gave the fictitious name \nin response to the defendants' interrogatories and  failed to produce documents noting his true \nidentity. Dotson, 202 F.R.D. at 566.  Moreover, the plaintiff resisted the opportunity to come clean \nabout his identity until the court granted the defendants' motion to compel, and even then, the \nplaintiff offered discovery responses that were less than completely forthcoming.  As Magistrate \nJudge Rosemond  observed,  the plaintiti \"impeded defendants'  discovery efforts regarding his \nidentity and arrest history at every juncture until his May 25, 2001 deposition [six months after the \naction was originally filed].\"  Id. at 568. \nConfronted with the extensive record of deception and obfhscation in Dotson, the court \ngranted the defendants'  motion to dismiss the plain!irrs action.  Magistrate Judge Rosemond \ndetem1ined that the plaintiff\"delibera!ely planned and carefully executed a scheme to deceive slate \nlaw enforcement and the state judicial machinery, and that he continued the deceit through lies, \nmisrepresentation, and non-disclosure in federal  court.\"  Dotson, 202 F.R.D.  at 570.  Further, \nMagistrate Judge Rosemond concluded that the plaintiffs conduct \"interfered with and obstructed \nthe 'judicial process' a process which 'clearly includes a party's right to full, complete and truthful \ndiscovery.\"'  !d.  at 573 (citation omitted).  Noting that the court's inherent power to dismiss an \n6 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:399\n.· \naction is essential to a trial court's ability to manage its case load and protect the interests oflitigants, \nMagistrate Judge Rosemond held that dismissal was warranted in light of the plaintiffs perjury and \nfraud.  !d. at 576. \nPlaintiffs alleged misconduct falls short of the misconduct in Dotson, however, and thus, \ndismissal would not be appropriate here.  First, Plaintiffs usc of the name lorenzo Rodriguez was \nless egregious because that nan1e quali fled  as a \"true alias.\"  Indeed, Defend;mts concede that \nPlaintiff had used the nan1e in connection with his efforts to secure employment after he arrived in \nthe United States.  Unlike in Dotson, therefore, Plaintiff did not invent a fictitious name solely for \nthe purpose of deceiving the police or the cmtrts. \nSecond, Plaintiff disclosed his true name in response to Defendants' discovery and testi fled \nextensively in his deposition about the various na111es he had used with the authorities.  This is in \nstark contrast to Dotson, where the plaintiff supplied false and misleading responses in discovery, \ngave perjured deposition testimony, and came clean regarding his identity reluctantly and only after \nthe court granted the defendants' motion to compel.  Dotson, 202 F.R.D. at 566-68. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs disclosure in iliis case cannot be considered truly voluntary \ncoming, as it did, only in response to Defendants' discovery.  Defendants argue, in other words, that \nPlaintiffs disclosure was not voluntary because he was required to provide this information under \nthe Federal Rules. In this sense, however, no disclosure ofp otentially relevant information after the \ncommencement of litigation could ever be considered tmly voluntary, if only in light of the initial \ndisclosure requirements and the ongoing duty to supplement under Rule 26. \nPlaintiff might have attempted to prolong the deception by giving false or misleading answers \nin response to Defendants' discovery and by withholding production of certain documents, but this \n7 \n\n• Case: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:400\nPlaintiff did not do so.  Cf. Millerv. Hojjinan, No. A 97-7987, 1999 WL 415397, at* 10 (E.D. Pa. \nJune 22, 1999) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiff had filed suit under an alias but later \ntesti fled about his true identity during his deposition); see also Morris v. McMasler-Carr Supply Co., \nNo. 01 C 6349, 2002 WL 1290390, at *3 (N.D. Ill. June 10, 2002) (refusing to dismiss the plaintiffs \ncomplaint for supplying false in formation in his discovery responses, in part because the plaintiff \n\"did come clean at his deposition\"). \nTo be sure, Plaintiff should have us~d his true name from the outset, and the reasonable time \nto have disclosed his true name W(>uld  have been when he flied  his complaint in this action. \nPlaintiffs counsel argues that the timing ofPiaintiffs disclosure was reasonable because he suggests \nthat he learned his client's true name sometime on March 18, 2002 and that he disclosed this \ninformation to Defendants very shmily thereafter.  Mr. Morgan's affidavit, however, is somewhat \nvague on this question.  lie claims that he learned his client's true identity on March 18, 2002, but \ndoes not  rule out that he  may have sirnply forgotten  this  information or  failed to  previously \nunderstand it.  (SeeR. 59-1, Pl.'s Obj. to Defs.' Mol. to Dismiss, Aff. ofKccvan D. Morgan aq\\4.) \nAs Defendants point out, Plainti rrs \"disclosure at the llrst reasonable lime\" argument ignores \nMr. Morgan's obligations under the Federal Rules to scrutinize his client's allegations prior to flling \nthe complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 (b)(3) (\"By presenting to the court (whether by signing, ftling, \nsubmitting,  or  later  advocating)  a  pleading,  written  motion,  or  other  paper,  an  attorney  or \nunrepresented party is certifying that to the best o I' the person's knowledge, infom1ation, and belief, \n8 \n\nCase: 1:01-cv-04486 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/14/02 Page 10 of 10 PageID #:401\nfonned after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, ... the allegations and other factual \ncontentions have evidentiary support ... \").  Regardless when Mr. Morgan became aware of \nPlaintiff's true  identity, however, Plaintiffs alleged  misconduct d\\Jes  not  measure up to the \nplaintiffs misconduct conduct in Dotson. \nThird, any prejudice to Del\"endants caused by Plaintiff's failure to disclose his true identity \nis minimal compared to the prejudice suffered by the Dotson defendants.  Indeed, there is no \nsuggestion that Defendants are still lacking information concerning Plaintiffs background. To the \ncontrary, Defendants have apparently assembled a detailed limeline ofPlaintiffs earlier attempts to \nconfuse the authorities by using various other names or aliases. Defendants have apparently received \ndocumentation concerning Plaintiffs use of various names with the authorities, ami they were able \nto question him thoroughly on this issue in his deposition.  Thus, it appears that the prejudice to \nDefendants here has been limited. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied. \nDATED: November 14, 2002  ENTERED \n9 ",
