New York City Housing Authority (originally E.D.N.Y., filed 2002; transferred to S.D.N.Y. in 2005 and consolidated with Heyer). </p><p>On February 20, 1980, individuals with mobility impairments who were eligible for the Section 8 program commenced a class action lawsuit, <i>Heyer v. City of New York Housing Authority</i>, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the New York City Housing Authority under the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act alleging that the New York City Housing Authority failed to provide individuals with mobility impairments, who have been, are, or will be qualified for the Section 8 program, with effective assistance in finding accessible housing. </p><p>The District Court certified a class, and in 1982 ordered a settlement agreement that required the defendant to take certain remedial steps under the supervision of the District Court. However, the settlement had no termination provision, and at some point the settlement fell into disuse.  </p><p>Then on June 17, 2002, a class of individuals with mobility impairment who were eligible for the Section 8 program filed <i>Bennett v. New York City Housing Authority</i> in the Eastern District of New York challenging similar violations by the Housing Authority. In <i>Bennett</i>, the plaintiffs sued under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Fair Housing Act, alleging that the New York City Housing Authority failed or refused to assist them in finding housing so that they can make use of their housing vouchers. More specifically, they claimed that the defendants failed or refused to assist them in finding housing with accommodations for individuals with mobility impairments. Represented by the New York Legal Assistance Group, the <i>Bennett</i> plaintiffs asked the Court for injunctive and declaratory relief.</p><p>Unaware of the <i>Heyer</i> case and settlement agreement, the parties fully litigated a motion to dismiss, which was granted in a December 16, 2002 Memorandum and Order by U.S. District Judge Charles P. Sifton. The Judge agreed with the defendant that there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the complaint as futile. 248 F.Supp.2d 166. Shortly thereafter, the parties began negotiating a settlement and on May 4, 2005, the parties signed a Stipulation and Order of Settlement in which the defendants agreed to: make accommodations for disabled individuals in the application process for public housing, regularly update its lists of available apartments, work with approved real estate brokers to locate apartments that may be suitable for individuals with mobility impairments, and recommend that landlords modify apartments to suit individuals with mobility impairments. The issue of attorneys' fees was handled privately by the parties.</p><p>It was not until 2005, three years after <i>Bennett</i> was filed, that the parties became aware of the earlier <i>Heyer</i> case. The <i>Bennett</i>  case was then transferred from the Eastern District of New York to the Southern District of New York so that the new (<i>Bennett</i>) litigation could be consolidated with the old (<i>Heyer</i>) litigation. </p><p>The two consolidated cases were settled in 2006, which dissolved the 1982 <i>Heyer</i> stipulation and substituted a new stipulation imposing certain obligations, including a reporting requirement, on the Housing Authority for a three year period to begin on April 27, 2006. However, after the Housing Authority failed to fulfill its obligations during that three year period, the Court extended its jurisdiction over the consolidated cases from 2009 to 2011. </p><p>On January 30, 2012, after the plaintiffs complained about the Housing Authority's continued failure to meet the monitoring requirements, the parties negotiated the terms of yet another revised stipulation, which imposed additional obligations on the Housing Authority, including monitoring by the attorneys for the plaintiffs for three months after signing the Stipulation. This stipulation was set to run until April 30, 2014 unless extended by consent of the parties or order of the Court. There has been no further movement on the case; presumably the case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On February 20, 1980, individuals with mobility impairments who were eligible for the Section 8 program commenced <i>Heyer v. City of New York Housing Authority</i>, a class action lawsuit against the New York Housing Authority for its alleged failure to provide individuals with mobility impairments who have been, are, or will be qualified for the Section 8 program with effective assistance in finding accessible housing. The District Court certified a class and in 1982 ordered a settlement agreement, which at some point fell into disuse. Then in 2002, a class of individuals with mobility impairment who were eligible for the Section 8 program filed <i>Bennett v. New York City Housing Authority</i> in the Eastern District of New York, challenging similar violations by the Housing Authority. Unaware of the <i>Heyer</i> case and settlement agreement, the <i>Bennet</i> parties fully litigated the defendant's motion to dismiss which was granted in a December 16, 2002 Memorandum and Order. It was not until 2005 that the <i>Heyer</i> litigation was discovered by the <i>Bennett</i> parties. After moving the <i>Bennett</i> case to the Southern District of New York, the parties reached an agreement in 2006 in which the <i>Bennett</i> case was consolidated with the 1980 <i>Heyer</i> case. Also in the 2006 stipulation and settlement agreement, the Housing Authority agreed to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities looking for Section 8 housing. After the Housing Authority failed to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, the court elected to extend its jurisdiction over the case from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, the parties negotiated a revised stipulation which imposed additional obligations on the Housing Authority. Since then, there has been no further movement on this case, and the case has been closed. ",

New York. \nDecember 18, 2002. \n168*168 Jane Greengold Stevens, Laura Davis, New York Legal Assistance Group, New \nYork City, for plaintiffs. \nCharles S. Kleinberg, U.S. Attorneys Office, Carole W. Wilson, Howard M. Schmeltzer, David \nM. Reizes, Scott de la Vega, Lillanne Alexander, U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, for Defendants. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nSIFTON, Senior District Judge. \nPlaintiffs Karen Bennett, Susana Lopez Lira, and Deborah Paulin bring this action on behalf \nof themselves and all others similarly situated for damages, declaratory and injunctive relief \nagainst the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") and Tino Hernandez, in his official \ncapacity as Chairperson of NYCHA (collectively, \"city defendants\"); and also against the \nUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and Mel Martinez, in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of HUD (collectively, \"federal defendants\"). The original \ncomplaint asserts claims for relief against the federal defendants under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Section 504\"); Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165; and the Fair Housing \nAct (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(f), 3608(e)(5) for federal defendants' alleged failure to \nadequately oversee the actions of the NYCHA defendants and ensure their compliance with \nthe regulatory scheme of the federal Section 8 housing assistance program. Federal \ndefendants move to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), or \nalternatively for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Plaintiffs \ncross-move for leave to amend the complaint under rule 15(a). For reasons set forth below, \nfederal defendants' motion to dismiss is granted and plaintiffs' motion is denied as futile. \nBACKGROUND \n\nHUD is the federal funding agency overseeing the Section 8 housing program. Under that \nprogram, HUD distributes funds through local public housing authorities (\"PHAs\") in the form \nof vouchers to low-income families to help them rent apartments through their local \nPHA. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o), 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(b). Landlord participation in this \nSection 8 program is voluntary, 24 C.F.R. § 982.302(b), but HUD directs PHAs to encourage \nlandlords with handicapped-accessible units to participate in the program as part of their \neffort to encourage landlord 169*169 participation generally. 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(2). HUD \nregulations create an administrative process by which beneficiaries claiming discrimination \non the basis of a disability may file an administrative complaint with HUD, either individually \nor on behalf of a class. 24 C.F.R. § 8.56(c)(1). Those claiming discrimination in violation of \nSection 504 may also file a complaint with HUD under regulations adopted specifically for its \nenforcement. 28 C.F.R. § 35.171. Finally, any interested person seeking issuance, \namendment, or repeal of a regulation under the Section 8 program may petition the \nSecretary of HUD for such action under its rulemaking procedures. 24 C.F.R. § 10.20(b). \nPlaintiffs have not pursued any of these administrative remedies prior to filing the present \nsuit. \nDISCUSSION \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) states, in relevant part, that \"a party may amend the \nparty's pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party; and \nleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\" Leave to amend is to be granted absent \n\"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure \ndeficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by \nvirtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of amendment.\" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. \n178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962);accord Williams v. Brooklyn Union Gas \nCo., 819 F.Supp. 214, 223 (E.D.N.Y.1993). Plaintiffs proposed amended complaint \nwithdraws certain claims and pleads the federal defendants' alleged violations of plaintiffs' \nrights with additional particularity. As discussed below in the context of the federal \ndefendants' motion, even the proposed amended complaint does not withstand a motion to \ndismiss. Leave to amend the complaint is therefore denied as futile. See Halpert v. Wertheim \n& Co., Inc. 81 F.R.D. 734, 735 (S.D.N.Y., 1979) (\"If the complaint, as amended, could not \nwithstand a motion to dismiss, a motion to amend need not be granted.\"). \nIn their opposition to defendants' motion, plaintiffs concede that they cannot maintain a claim \nagainst the federal defendants under Title II of the ADA and withdraw that claim as well as \ntheir claim for monetary damages against the federal defendants. However, they maintain \nthe validity of their claims under Section 504 and the FHA. The proposed amended \ncomplaint claims that HUD has failed to structure the Section 8 program in a manner that \nrequires and enables public housing authorities to provide effective assistance to people with \ndisabilities to enable them to enjoy the benefits of the program equally to those enjoyed by \n\npeople without disabilities ... [or] adequately oversee the actions of the NCHA defendants \nand ... ensure that NYCHA defendants comply with existing federal regulations concerning \nthe rights of people with disabilities in the Section 8 program. \n(Proposed Am. Compl. ¶ 103.) In particular, plaintiffs allege that HUD's failure to affirmatively \nmandate that PHAs provide persons with disabilities certain forms of assistance suggested in \nHUD literature or to impose funding sanctions on the basis of placement rates for persons \nwith disabilities (as it does on the basis of overall placement rates) violates Section 504 and \nthe FHA. Id. ¶¶ 45-52. Accordingly, the only question currently to be decided is whether \nplaintiffs may maintain their claims under Section 504 and the FHA. \nFederal defendants first assert that they enjoy sovereign immunity to the claims asserted. \nCongressional waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory \ntext. See, e.g., 170*170 Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 \n(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, 503 U.S. 30, 33-34, 37, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d \n181 (1992); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 \n(1980). Plaintiffs do not argue the question of sovereign immunity under the FHA, apparently \nconceding the issue. In any event, the FHA does not include a waiver of sovereign \nimmunity. Almonte v. Pierce, 666 F.Supp. 517, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). \nWith respect to Section 504, plaintiffs claim that the 1978 amendment to the Rehabilitation \nAct includes a waiver of sovereign immunity and that they may bring an action directly under \nthat section or under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et \nseq., challenging the federal defendants' actions or failures to act. Federal defendants \nconcede that Section 504 as amended does include a waiver of sovereign immunity but \nargue that it provides no private right of action against HUD. Federal defendants also argue \nthat plaintiffs may not maintain an action under the APA. Each argument will be considered \nin turn. \nPrivate Right of Action \nIn Marlow v. United States Department of Education, 820 F.2d 581 (2d Cir. 1987), the \nSecond Circuit considered whether the Rehabilitation Act provides a private right of action. \nThe plaintiff in Marlow sued the Department and Secretary of Education seeking to reopen \nhis administrative complaint and an order allowing him to rebut a finding by the Department's \nOffice for Civil Rights that he was not an \"otherwise qualified handicapped person\" under the \nRehabilitation Act. Marlow, 820 F.2d at 581-82. The court of appeals first noted that Section \n504 was modeled after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that the enforcement \nscheme of Title VI also applies to Section 504. Id. at 582, see also29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(2). The \ncourt of appeals found that the first avenue of review, dealing with agency decisions to \nterminate or refuse to grant funding, does not provide a private right of action to a \n\ncomplainant alleging that a funding recipient (such as NYCHA) has not violated Section \n504. Marlow, 820 F.2d at 582. The second avenue of review, the court held, is the \nAPA. Id. Plaintiffs APA claim is discussed further below. \nThe court noted that there is an implied right of action under Section 504 against recipients \nof federal funds but stated that such an implied right of action against the funding agency \nitself would only be found in narrow circumstances. Id. at 583. In support of this ruling, the \ncourt noted that allowing plaintiff to proceed would disrupt its enforcement efforts in a \nmanner inconsistent with the statutory and regulatory scheme of Section 504 and pointed out \nthat Title VI, upon which that scheme was based, was \"aimed at protecting individual rights \nwithout subjecting the Government to suits.\" Id. The court also noted that the remedial \npurpose of Section 504 would not be undermined by its holding, because the plaintiff could \nstill pursue an action directly against the recipient of federal funds. Id. at 584. \nFollowing Marlow, other courts in this Circuit have found that the Rehabilitation Act does not \nafford private plaintiffs a right of action against the federal funding agency. See, e.g.,Ohta v. \nMuraski, 1993 WL 366525, at *9 n. 25 (D.Conn.1993) (Cabranes, J.). Plaintiffs attempt to \nrespond to the precedent in this Circuit by invoking Ninth Circuit precedent and arguing \nthat Marlow is distinguishable on its facts. The Ninth Circuit cases cited by plaintiff are plainly \ninconsistent with the reasoning and outcome of the Marlow court; accordingly, they will not \nbe followed on the issue 171*171 of implied rights of action. SeeDoe v. Att'y Gen'l of the \nU.S., 941 F.2d 780 (9th Cir.1991) (finding an implied right of action under Section 504 as \namended based on the history of such implied rights of action under Section 504 and Title \nVI); J.L. v. Social Sec. Admin., 971 F.2d 260 (9th Cir.1992) (same, but finding that prudential \nconcerns made it appropriate for plaintiffs to develop a record before the administrative \nagency before coming to federal court). As defendants point out, the Ninth Circuit is the \nexception to the rule on this issue. SeeWomen's Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d \n742, 749 (D.C.Cir.1990) (collecting cases). \nPlaintiffs argue that Marlow is distinguishable because the plaintiff in that case was only \nchallenging a ruling on his individual complaint against a funds recipient. Rather than \nseeking review of a particular agency decision, plaintiffs here are challenging HUD's \nsystematic failure to ensure that NYCHA administers Section 8 programs in a \nnondiscriminatory manner. It is true that the Marlow court cited an agency's conscious and \nexpress abdication of its enforcement duties, as well as its acquiescence or active \nparticipation in discriminatory practices, as among the \"special circumstances\" under which a \nprivate right of action might be implied. Marlow, 820 F.2d at 583. HUD has in place an \nadministrative mechanism for parties seeking additional regulations. Plaintiffs have not seen \nfit to make use of this mechanism, nor have they in any way brought HUD's alleged failings \nto agency attention. Under such circumstances, I cannot say that there has been \"conscious \nabdication\" of statutory duties or \"acquiescence\" in PHA discrimination. Accordingly, I \n\nconclude that there is no implied private right of action in favor of plaintiffs seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against a funding agency under Section 504 based on a \nclaim that the agency has not adopted enforcement mechanisms over and above those \nalready in place. \nReview Under APA \nThe APA provides for judicial review of \"final agency action.\" 5 U.S.C. § 704. Plaintiffs admit \nthat they have not brought their claims to HUD's attention. They nevertheless argue, \nciting Sierra Club v. Thomas, 828 F.2d 783 (D.C.Cir. 1987), that agency inaction may \nconstitute final action reviewable under the APA. In Sierra Club was faced with an alleged \ndelay in concluding a pending rulemaking, not a failure to implement rulemakingsua \nsponte, and the categories of inaction held to be reviewable all presumed either a pending \nrequest for relief or a \"clear statutory duty,\" the shunning of which would be \"of such \nmagnitude that it amounts to an abdication of statutory responsibility.\" Id. at 793-95. As \ndiscussed above, plaintiffs have not alleged any such \"clear statutory duty\" to enact the \nregulations it seeks, and they have not brought their claims to HUD for administrative review. \nThe requirement of final agency action serves the purpose of preventing the courts \"from \nentangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to \nprotect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been \nformalized....\" Abbott Laboratories, Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 \nL.Ed.2d 681 (1967). In terms of determining whether agency action is \"final,\" a court will \nconsider \"whether the process of administrative decisionmaking has reached a stage where \njudicial review will not be disruptive of the agency process and whether legal consequences \nwill flow from the action taken....\" Seafarers International Union of North America v. United \nStates Coast Guard, 736 F.2d 19, 26 (2d Cir.1984) (quotingNatural \nResources 172*172 Defense Council, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, 539 F.2d 824, 836-37 (2d Cir.1976), vacated and remanded for consideration \nof mootness, 434 U.S. 1030, 98 S.Ct. 759, 54 L.Ed.2d 777 (1978)). In this case, plaintiffs \nhave failed to generate any record upon which HUD's policymaking might be reviewed for \nerrors of law. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit cases on which plaintiffs rely for their argument in \nsupport of an implied right of action directly under Section 504 weigh against their argument \nin favor of reviewability under the APA, an issue on which Second Circuit law is not so clearly \ncontradictory. In J.L., the court found that plaintiffs should in the first instance pursue their \nclaims with the relevant agency in order to develop a record for review, then return to court if \nthey were unsatisfied with the agency action.J.L., 971 F.2d at 270-72. Where plaintiffs have \nnot even brought their claims to the attention of a funding agency, there is no \"final action\" or \ninaction ripe for review under the APA. \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, federal defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction is granted. I therefore have no occasion to consider its motion to dismiss for \nfailure to state a claim or its alternative motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' motion for \nleave to amend the complaint is denied as futile. \nThe Clerk is directed to furnish a filed copy of the within to all parties and to the magistrate \njudge. \nSO ORDERED. \n ",

This is a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of persons with \nmobility impairments who have been granted vouchers from the Section 8 Housing Choice \nVoucher Program administered by the New York City Housing Authority.  Plaintiffs allege that \ndefendants have violated their rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \nU.S. C.  § 794 et seq. (\"Section 504\"); 24 C.F.R. Part 8; Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. (\"the ADA\"); 28 C.F.R. Part 35; and the Fair Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (\"FHA\"), by failing or refusing to assist them in finding housing so \nthat they can make use of their housing vouchers. \nI \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 2 of 18 PageID #: 2\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for civil \nactions arising under the laws of the United States; 28 U.S.C. § 1343 for actions under laws \nproviding for the protection of civil rights; and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 \net seq. \n3.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139l(e) because two of the \nnamed plaintiffs reside in this district. \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff KAREN BENNETT is a person with disabilities who has been granted a \nSection 8 voucher and needs assistance in locating appropriate, accessible housing.  She currently \nresides in Brooklyn, New York, but faces imminent eviction. \n5.  Plaintiff SUSANA LOPEZ LIRA is a person with disabilities who has been granted a \nSection 8 voucher and needs assistance in locating appropriate, accessible housing.  She currently \nresides in Brooklyn, New York, but in an apartment which is not accessible and in which her \ntenancy is not stable. \n6.  Plaintiff DEBORAH PAULIN is a person with disabilities who has been granted a \nSection 8 voucher and needs assistance in locating appropriate, accessible housing. She currently \nlives in a shelter in Manhattan. \n7.  Defendant NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY (\"NYCHA\") is the public \nhousing agency in the City of New York and is responsible for administering the Section 8 \ntenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program as well as for managing public housing in all \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 3 of 18 PageID #: 3\nboroughs of the City. \n8.  Defendant TINO HERNANDEZ is the Chairperson ofNYCHA and as such is \nresponsible for the administration of all ofNYCHA' s programs.  He is being sued in his official \ncapacity.  Collectively, NYCHA and Hernandez will be referred to as ''NYCHA defendants.\" \n9.  Defendant UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN \nDEVELOPMENT (\"HUD\") is the federal executive agency responsible for the administration of \nthe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and the public housing program. \n10.  Defendant MEL MARTINEZ is the Secretary ofHUD and as such is responsible for \nthe administration of all ofHUD's programs.  He is being sued in his official capacity. \nCollectively, HUD and Martinez will be referred to as \"HUD defendants.\" \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nII. The named plaintiffs, KAREN BENNETT, SUSANA LOPEZ LIRA, and \nDEBORAH PAULIN, bring this action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, on behalf of themselves and as representatives of all individuals with mobility \nimpairments who are or will be holders of Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program vouchers \nthrough NYCHA. \n12.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n13.  There are questions oflaw and fact common to the class which predominate over any \nquestions affecting only the individual plaintiffs, including, but not limited to whether the \ndefendants are violating plaintiffs' rights under Section 504 and the ADA and their implementing \nregulations by failing to provide assistance in locating apartments when necessary, and to notify \n3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 4 of 18 PageID #: 4\nthem of their right to such assistance. \n14.  The claims of the individual named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of all class \nmembers. \n15.  The representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all \nmembers of the class, because they each have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis case, they have no interest antagonistic to others in the class, and they are represented by the \nNew York Legal Assistance Group, counsel experienced in class action litigation generally, and \nspecifically in litigation involving the rights of people with disabilities. \n16.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual members ofthe class would create \nthe risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to the practices at issue in this \naction.  Separate actions would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of other \nmembers of the class and would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their own \ninterests. \n17.  The defendants have acted and will act on grounds generally applicable to each \nmember of the plaintiff class, thereby making appropriate final declaratory and injunctive relief \nwith respect to the class as a whole.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY SCHEME \n18. The Section 8 program is intended to provide \"decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for \nfamilies oflower income.\" 42 U.S. C. § 1437. \n19. The Section 8 program is administered byHUD, through local public housing \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 5 of 18 PageID #: 5\nauthorities (\"PHAs\").  42 U.S.C. § 1437(f).  HUD has promulgated regulations governing the \nSection 8 program, codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 982. \n20.  When an individual is found eligible for the Section 8 program, he or she is given a \n\"voucher\" and is supposed to find an apartment in the private housing market with a landlord \nwho is willing to sign a contract with the PHA, pursuant to which the PHA pays a portion of the \nrent.  24 C.F.R.§ 982.l(b)(2). \n21.  Section 504 states that \"no otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n22.  A program or activity receiving federal financial assistance is prohibited from \ndenying a qualified handicapped person \"the opportunity accorded others to participate in the \nprogram\" and \"an equal opportunity to achieve the same benefits that others achieve in the \nprogram.\" 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(b)(i) & (ii). \n23.  The ADA states that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 \nu.s.c. \n§ 12132. \n24.  A \"public entity'' is \"any department, agency, ... or other instrumentality of a State or \nStates or local government.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n25.  Federal regulations require that public entities must \"make available \nto ... beneficiaries, and other interested persons information regarding the ... protections against \n5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 6 of 18 PageID #: 6\ndiscrimination assured them by the Act and this part.\"  28 C.F.R. § 35.106. \n26.  \"A public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, ... on the basis of \nthe disability, [ d]eny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from the aid, benefit, or service.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(l)(i). \n27.  HUD has promulgated federal regulations implementing Section 504 as it applies to \nthe administration of the Section 8 program.  24 C.F.R. Part 8. \n28.  The federal regulations mandate that \"(w]hen issuing a .... Housing Voucher to a \nfamily which includes an individual with handicaps,\" the PHA must \"include a current listing of \navailable accessible units known to the PHA and, if necessary, otherwise assist the family in \nlocating an available accessible dwelling unit.\"  24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3). \n29.  The regulations further require that PHAs, in their activities to encourage \nparticipation by landlords, \"include encouragement of participation by owners having accessible \nunits.\"  24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(2). \n30.  PHAs must \"[t]ake into account the special problem of ability to locate an accessible \nunit when considering requests by eligible individuals with handicaps for extensions of...Housing \nVouchers; and ... (i]fnecessary as a reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities, \napprove a family request for an exception rent under § 982.504(b )(2) for a regular tenancy under \nthe Section 8 certificate program so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by \npersons with disabilities.\" 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(4) & (5). \n31.  The initial term of a Section 8 voucher is 60 days, and PHAs may grant extensions at \ntheir discretion.  24 C.F.R. § 982.303.  But the regulations mandate that \"[i]fthe family needs \nand requests an extension of the initial voucher term as a reasonable accommodation, in \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 7\naccordance with part 8 of this title, to make the program accessible to a family member who is a \nperson with disabilities, the PHA must extend the voucher up to the term reasonably required for \nthat purpose.\" 24 C.F.R. § 982.303(b) (2). \n32. The general regulations controlling the Section 8 program govern the waiting lists for \nboth the tenant-based Section 8 program and the public housing programs also administered by \nPHAs.  PHAs may merge the waiting lists for these different programs, at their own discretion. \nIfthey do not choose to merge the lists, if the waiting list for tenant-based assistance is open \nwhen an applicant is placed on the waiting list for the PHA's public housing program, \"the PHA \nmust offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for tenant-based assistance.\" And conversely, \nif the waiting list for the public housing program is open when an applicant is placed on the \nwaiting list for its tenant-based program, \"and if the other program includes units suitable for the \napplicant, the PHA must offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for the other program.\" 24 \nC.F.R. § 982.205(a)(2). \n33. The FHA prohibits discrimination in housing against persons with disabilities.  42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(f)(2)(A). \n34.  The FHA defines discrimination as \"a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in \nrules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford [a \ndisabled] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B). \n35.  The FHA mandates that HUD \"administer the programs and activities relating to \nhousing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of [the FHA].\" \n42 U.S. C.§ 3608(e)(5). \n7 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 8 of 18 PageID #: 8\nFACTS PERTAINING TO THE CLASS \n36.  NYCHA defendants receive federal money for the Section 8 program. \n37.  NYCHA defendants have not made and are not making reasonable efforts to provide \nto tenants with mobility impairments current, useful lists of available, accessible apartments \nwhose landlords will accept Section 8 vouchers. \n38.  The lists of supposedly available apartments provided by NYCHA to Section 8 \nvoucher holders show: of the apartments listed as available on July 27, 2001, two (2) out of two \nhundred and eleven (211) are marked as accessible (0.95%); of those listed on AprilS, 2002, zero \nout of sixty-six (66) are marked as accessible (0.0%); and of those listed on May 3, 2002, three \n(3) out of ninety-one (91) are marked as accessible (3.3%).  Few, if any, ofthese apartments are \navailable. \n39.  NYCHA defendants do not assist voucher holders who have mobility impairments in \nlocating appropriate, accessible apartments whose landlords will accept Section 8 tenants, even \nwhen such assistance is necessary to enable the voucher holders to locate housing. \n40.  NYCHA defendants have no established policy or practice for offering to place on \nthe public housing waiting list applicants for their Section 8 program or for offering to place on \nthe Section 8 waiting list applicants for their public housing program. \n41.  NYCHA defendants have no established policy or practice for making such offers to \npeople with mobility impairments. \n42.  NYCHA defendants have not made and are not making reasonable efforts to \nencourage participation in the Section 8 program by landlords with accessible dwelling units. \n43.  NYCHA defendants have no established policy or practice of informing people with \n8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 9 of 18 PageID #: 9\nmobility impairments that they may obtain housing subsidies above market rents if that is \nnecessary for them to find appropriate, accessible apartments. \n44.  NYCHA defendants have no policy of informing people with mobility impairments \nthat NYCHA will provide other assistance in finding available, accessible apartments. \nFACTS ABOUT THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n45.  Plaintiff KAREN BENNETT has Multiple Sclerosis (\"MS\"), a progressive \nneuromuscular disease which now requires her to use a wheelchair.  She lives with five of her \nchildren, all of whom are under the age of 14. \n46.  The only sources of income to Ms. Bennett's family are Supplemental Security \nmcome and public assistance. \n4 7.  Ms. Bennett has had a Section 8 voucher since approximately 1992 and her current \nlandlady has accepted her Section 8 subsidy. \n48.  Ms. Bennett's current apartment is on the second floor in a house with no elevator. \nHer children carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs and she must drag herself, crawling, up \nand down the stairs. \n49.  Because her apartment is not accessible to people with mobility impairments and \nbecause conditions in the apartment were, and are, terrible, Ms. Bennett began a search for a new \napartment more than one year ago. \n50.  Ill April 2001, Ms. Bennett requested a transfer voucher from NYCHA to permit her \nto transfer to another apartment. \n51.  When Ms. Bennett initially requested the transfer voucher from NYCHA, NYCHA \n9 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 10 of 18 PageID #: 10\ndid not offer to place her on the waiting list for NYCHA's public housing program, or otherwise \nsuggest that she apply to that program.  In March 2002, on her own initiative, Ms. Bennett filed \nan application for public housing. \n52.  In June 2001, Ms. Bennett received a 30-day Notice from her landlady informing her \nthat the landlady was about to start court proceedings to regain possession of the apartment for \nher own family.  The landlady subsequently commenced a proceeding in Housing Court, to \nwhich Ms. Bennet has no defense. \n53.  On approximately September 4, 2001, Ms. Bennett appeared in Housing Court and \nsigned a Stipulation agreeing to move by February 28, 2002. \n54.  On September 24, 2001, NYCHA issued a transfer voucher to Ms. Bennett. \n55.  Because she was unable to find an accessible apartment large enough for herself and \nher five children, Ms. Bennett was unable to move by February 28, 2002 and in April, a Warrant \nof Eviction was issued by the Housing Court. \n56.  Execution of the Warrant of Eviction has been stayed by the Housing Court until July \n15, 2002.  Efforts are being made by Ms. Bennett and her attorneys to obtain a further stay of the \neviction, but Ms. Bennett and her five children face imminent eviction. \n57.  Ms. Bennett has asked NYCHA for help in finding an apartment because she needed \nan accessible apartment whose landlord would accept Section 8 vouchers and she was having \ntrouble finding such an apartment. \n58.  NYCHA has given Ms. Bennett several lists oflandlords who supposedly had \navailable apartments, and she has called the landlords on those lists. Very few, if any, of the \napartments on the lists were identified as accessible.  No landlord had an available, accessible \n10 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 11\napartment. \n59.  Ms. Bennett has also contacted real estate brokers and individual landlords, but has \nnever been offered an appropriate apartment. \n60.  Although Ms. Bennett requested assistance from NYCHA in finding an apartment, \nNYCHA has not offered any help to Ms. Bennett in her efforts to find an appropriate, accessible \napartment that would accept her Section 8 voucher, other than to provide her with lists.  Without \nassistance from NYCHA, Ms. Bennett is unlikely to find an appropriate, accessible apartment. \n61.  Plaintiff DEBORAH PAULIN is a 40 year old woman with MS, who since the fall of \n200 I, has used a motorized scooter to travel some of the time.  The rest of the time she uses a \ncane. \n62.  Ms. Paulin has been living in a homeless shelter since approximately December 2000 \nwith her daughter, who is now a freshman in college and comes \"home\" to her mother on \nholidays and summer vacation. \n63.  Ms. Paulin's only source of income is Social Security Disability benefits. \n64.  Ms. Paulin applied to NYCHA's public housing program in approximately January \n2001.  At that time she did not yet know that she had MS, but she was having multiple medical \nproblems and had trouble standing up, so she asked for an accessible apartment. \n65.  When Ms. Paulin applied for a NYCHA apartment, no one at NYCHA asked her if \nshe was interested in applying for a Section 8 voucher at the same time. \n66.  In approximately March 2001, Ms. Paulin was diagnosed with MS. \n67.  At around that same time, Ms. Paulin moved into the Regency Family Residence \nwhere she now lives.  There she had a new caseworker, who suggested that she apply for a \n11 \n\n......... \n____________________ \nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 12\nSection 8 voucher, which she did. \n68.  When Ms. Paulin applied for a Section 8 voucher, she requested assistance from \nNYCHA because of her disability.  NYCHA offered no assistance other than to provide with a \nlist of supposedly available apartments. \n69.  In February, 2002, Ms. Paulin received a Section 8 voucher and attended the \ncompulsory briefing.  At that time, she asked ifNYCHA would help her find an apartment and \nwas told that they would not. \n70.  In February 2002, Ms. Paulin was notified that she was being offered a NYCHA \napartment, but it was not accessible. \n71.  Subsequently, NYCHA withdrew the offer of an apartment stating that Ms. Paulin \nwas no longer \"a family\" because her daughter was in college.  Still later, NYCHA claimed that \nMs. Paulin was not eligible because she owed money from a prior NYCHA tenancy. \n72.  Ms. Paulin is disputing both of these bases for NYCHA's denial of her current \neligibility. \n73.  Ms. Paulin has received lists from NYCHA of supposedly available Section 8 \napartments, but there were almost no accessible apartments on the lists, and when she called the \nlandlords, she was told there were no available, accessible apartments. \n74.  Ms. Paulin has several times requested assistance from NYCHA in finding an \napartment, but has always been told that NYCHA does not provide any such help, and she has \nreceived no such help. \n75.  Most recently, Ms. Paulin was told that there might be a NYCHA apartment \navailable to her. \n12 \n\n______________________.  ...... \nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 13\n76.  IfNYCHA actually offers her an apartment, she will withdraw her claims in this \naction, but because that has not yet happened, and because she has had the experience of offers \nbeing withdrawn, she continues to seek assistance in making use of her Section 8 voucher. \n77.  Without assistance from NYCHA, Ms. Paulin is unlikely to find an appropriate, \naccessible apartment. \n78.  Plaintiff SUSANA LOPEZ LIRA is a 52 year old woman with a mobility \nimpairment. She injured her hip in a car accident in 197 5 and that injury resulted in severe \ninfection in the joint. She has undergone four surgeries, ending in a procedure in which part of \nher hip was removed.  It is extremely difficult and painful for her to walk.  She is in severe, \nchronic, and debilitating pain and needs further surgery, but has not been able to have it because \nof her unstable housing situation. She has a motorized scooter, but cannot use it now because her \napartment is not accessible. \n79.  Ms. Lopez Lira is also legally blind, currently has a serious infection in one eye, and \nmay need a corneal transplant.  She cannot do this unless she has a safe, stable place to live. \n80.  Her only source of income is public assistance and food stamps. \n81.  Ms. Lopez Lira was evicted from her last apartment in approximately January 2001. \nShe spent several days in the subway and then obtained the help of a priest who paid for her to \nstay in a room in someone else's apartment. \n82.  The apartment is on the third floor of a building with no elevator and Ms. Lopez Lira \nis unable to use her scooter.  She must drag herself slowly and painfully up and down the flights \nof stairs. \n83.  Ms. Lopez Lira applied for a Section 8 voucher as a homeless person in January \n13 \n\n____________________.  ....... \nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 14\n2001, after her eviction. \n84.  At the time of her application, Ms. Lopez Lira informed NYCHA of her disability, \npresented medical information, and told them she would need an accessible apartment. \n85.  In November 2001, Ms. Lopez Lira received a Section 8 voucher.  When she went to \nthe briefing, one employee ofNYCHA, seeing that she was almost blind and was having trouble \nwalking, asked Ms. Lopez Lira if she had anyone-a friend, family member, husband-who \ncould help her find an apartment.  Ms. Lopez Lira said that she did not.  The NYCHA employee \nsaid, \"Good luck.\" \n86.  When Ms. Lopez Lira applied for a Section 8 voucher, no one asked her if she would \nlike to apply for a regular NYCHA apartment.  Later, when she asked about NYCHA apartments, \nshe was told that there was a long waiting list, and was given the impression that, because it \nwould take such a long time to get a NYCHA apartment, it was not even worth applying. \n87.  It is extremely difficult for Ms. Lopez Lira to look for an apartment because it is hard \nfor her to travel.  She has no telephone, and therefore cannot leave messages for landlords to call \nback. \n88.  She has gotten help from several social services agencies and has tried to call many \nlandlords and brokers, but she has not been able to find an accessible apartment whose landlord \nwill accept her Section 8 voucher. \n89.  Ms. Lopez Lira asked NYCHA for assistance in finding an apartment, but she was \ntold that NYCHA did not provide any such assistance and she has received no such assistance. \n90.  Without assistance from NYCHA, Ms. Lopez Lira is unlikely to find an appropriate \naccessible apartment. \n14 \n\n________________.  ........... \nCase 1:02-cv-03499-CPS-SMG   Document 1   Filed 06/17/02   Page 15 of 18 PageID #: 15\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n91.
