          "description": "TEXT ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 8/4/2016. On August 3, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the Fourth Circuit's mandate in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, case number 16A52, which held that the U.S. Department of Education's guidance as to the interpretation of \"on the basis of sex\" in its regulation implementing Title IX was entitled to Auer deference. As a result of today's telephone hearing, the court directs the parties to address the following: (1) whether, and if so how, the Supreme Court's stay of the mandate in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board affects this court, including as to the rules of law this court must apply; (2) this courts authority to grant preliminary injunctive relief, on a facial basis or otherwise, beyond the scope of the individually named Plaintiffs (both under Title IX and as a constitutional matter). Plaintiffs' briefs are due by 5:00 p.m. Monday, August 8, 2016. Defendants' responses are due by noon on Friday, August 12, 2016. Briefs are limited to 20 pages per side, and the parties are encouraged to work together. In addition, the parties are directed to meet and confer to determine if there is any value in adjusting the pretrial or trial schedule and whether or not there is agreement to participate in this district's mediation process. Parties are to report back via letter to Ms. Engle as to the results of the conference by 5:00 p.m. on August 8, 2016. SO ORDERED. Associated Cases: 1:16cv236, 1:16cv425, 1:16cv845(Engle, Anita)"

Therefore, the Court will plan to conduct a discovery status conference on September 2, 2016, and given the potential issues to be addressed, the Court will conduct that status conference in person rather than by telephone hearing. Therefore, this matter will be set for a discovery status conference on September 2, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 3 of United States Courthouse in Winston-Salem, NC. The parties should file their Joint Notice by August 31, 2016 to outline any issues that they would seek to raise at the status conference.

    "summary": "<p>This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (HB2), which was passed on March 23, 2016. For the others, see the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?saveRef=pl&amp;search=source%7Cgeneral%3BspecialCollection%7C43%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case collection.</a></p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that individuals only be permitted to use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates while in government buildings. For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules). In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,&rdquo; which prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law. The DOJ <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/north-carolina-hb2/481347/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asked</a> the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9, and that he remedy the violations, \"including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.\"</p>\r\n<p>Instead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking a declaratory judgment that HB2 did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2000e et seq.), or the Violence Against Woman Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 13925(b)(13)). That case is <a href=\"../../../../case/15316/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McCrory v. United States</a>. A few hours later, the U.S. filed this lawsuit, seeking to enjoin operation of HB2, in the U.S District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The DOJ sued the State of North Carolina under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2000e et seq.), under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (20 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1681 et seq.), and under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 13925(b)(13)). The DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the U.S. asked the Court to find that HB 2&rsquo;s Part I&mdash;the part that instructs public agencies to deny transgender individuals access to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity--violated federal law, and to issue an injunction ordering the state to stop violating the federal laws in question.</p>\r\n<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s former Attorney General, Roy Cooper, had <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68780957.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that he agreed that HB2 is illegal, and declined to defend it against this and the other lawsuits challenging it.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2016 the United States and the Defendants issued a joint motion to enjoin automatic suspension of funds received under the Violence Against Women Act that prohibits recipients of federal funds administered by the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Office on Violence Against Women (&ldquo;OVW&rdquo;) from engaging in discrimination based on sex and gender identity. The United States and the Defendants agreed that the suspension of funds would on balance harm the public interest. On June 23, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted the parties' joint motion to enjoin the United States from automatically withholding funds. 192 F.Supp.3d 620.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted Phil Berger, President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, the right to permissively intervene as defendants in the case. Several other private individuals requested to intervene on either side of the case and their motions were denied.</p>\r\n<p>On July 14, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder ordered that parties in the four related cases of HB2 file a short joint notice identifying any agreements reached and explaining their respective positions. On July 25, 2016, the Court consolidated this case with <em>Carca&ntilde;o v. McCrory</em>(1:16CV236), <em>Berger v. United States</em> (1:16CV844), and <em>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</em> (1:16CV845) for discovery purposes only. After this consolidation, the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed <em>Berger v. United States</em> on July 28, 2016, and <em>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</em> on August 31, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2016, the Defendants submitted motions to stay the proceedings in light of the Supreme Court hearing the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G.G.</a> case regarding similar issues. Ten days later, the United States submitted a response in opposition to the Defendants' request to stay the proceedings. The United States stated that the Defendants were violating federal laws and that the proceedings should not be delayed in anticipation of a change in the law.</p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2016, upon the joint motion of the parties and in the interest of judicial economy, the court stayed the proceedings in the case and in the related case of <em>Carcano v. McCrory</em> (1:16CV236) pending disposition in the Supreme Court of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., No. 16- 273 (S. Ct.). At the United States&rsquo; request, the court did not include the United States&rsquo; pending motion for preliminary injunction in the stay.</p>\r\n<p>On January 1, 2017, Roy Cooper, who opposed HB2 as NC Attorney General, took office as Governor of North Carolina, changing the Governor&rsquo;s position. On February 22, 2017, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, under President Trump, withdrew and rescinded their earlier guidance documents, changing the federal government&rsquo;s position. On March 2, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a request to expand the stay (granted on December 16, 2016) to include the preliminary injunction request, on the grounds that the United States had withdrawn two guidance documents upon which the motion was based.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a joint status report with the Carca&ntilde;o Plaintiffs, UNC Defendants, Legislative Defendants, and the State Defendants. The United States aligned itself with the UNC and Legislative Defendants requesting that the court leave the stay entered on December 16, 2016, until resolution of the pending appeals in <em>G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board</em> (4th Cir. No. 15-2056) and <em>Carca&ntilde;o v. Cooper</em> (4th Cir. No. 16-1989). The Carca&ntilde;o Plaintiffs and the State Defendants requested that the stay be lifted so that parties could confer about a new discovery plan.</p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2017, the North Carolina Legislature, and the newly appointed Governor enacted House Bill 142 which, among other things, repealed HB2. The repeal included a compromise that left many on both sides unhappy. The compromise prevented municipalities from passing anti-discrimination laws until December 2020, and the legislature still had the ability to regulate bathrooms.</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal stating that in light of the passage of House Bill 142, the claims and causes of actions against the Defendants would be dismissed with prejudice, which closed the case.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The United States files this complaint challenging a provision of North Carolina \nlaw requiring public agencies to deny transgender persons access to multiple-occupancy \nbathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity.   \n2.  As set forth below, Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of Part I of \nNorth Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (“H.B. 2”), which was enacted and became \neffective on March 23, 2016, constitutes a pattern or practice of employment discrimination on \nthe basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e, et seq. (“Title VII”); discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program \nreceiving federal funds in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”), and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 54 (2000), 34 \nC.F.R. Part 106 (2010); and discrimination on the basis of sex and gender identity in programs \n1 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 1 of 14\n\nreceiving federal funds in violation of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 \n(“VAWA”), 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6 and \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a), and 1345. \n4.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants are located \nwithin the Middle District of North Carolina and because a substantial part of the acts or \nomissions giving rise to this complaint arose from events occurring within this judicial district. \n5.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202; 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-6(a) and (b); 20 U.S.C. § \n1682; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 13925(b)(13)(C) and 3789d(c)(3). \nDEFENDANTS \n6.  Defendant State of North Carolina is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).   \n7.  Defendant Patrick McCrory is the Governor of North Carolina. Pursuant to \nArticle III, Section 1 of the North Carolina Constitution, “the executive power of the State” is \nvested in Defendant McCrory in his capacity as Governor.  Article III, Section 5(4) also provides \nthat it is the duty of Defendant McCrory in his capacity as Governor to “take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.”  Defendant McCrory is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e(a).  \n8.  Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety is an agency of the State \nof North Carolina responsible for public safety, corrections and emergency management.  It is a \n-2- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 2 of 14\n\nperson within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e(b).  It is currently and, at all times relevant to the Complaint, has been a recipient \nof federal funds from the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women, with open \ngrants dated after the reauthorization of VAWA on March 19, 2013.  As a condition of receiving \nfederal funds, Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety signed contract assurances \nagreeing that it will not discriminate in violation of federal law. \n9.  Defendant University of North Carolina is a public, multi-campus university that \nis organized under, and exists pursuant to, the laws of the State of North Carolina.  It is a person \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e(b). It is currently and, at all times relevant to the Complaint, has been a recipient of \nfederal funds from the United States Department of Justice, including the Office on Violence \nAgainst Women, with open grants dated after the reauthorization of VAWA on March 19, 2013.  \nAs a condition of receiving federal funds, Defendant University of North Carolina signed \ncontract assurances agreeing that it will not discriminate in violation of federal law. \n10.  Defendant Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina is the \ncorporate body charged with the general control, supervision, and governance of the University \nof North Carolina and is capable under North Carolina law of suing and being sued in any court. \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nEnactment of H.B. 2 \n11.  On March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature convened a special session for \nthe purpose of passing H.B. 2. \n-3- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 3 of 14\n\n12.  H.B. 2 mandates, inter alia, that all “[p]ublic agencies . . . require multiple \noccupancy bathrooms or changing facilities . . . be designated for and only used by individuals \nbased on their biological sex.”  H.B. 2 defines “biological sex” as “[t]he physical condition of \nbeing male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.”  H.B. 2 further defines \n“public agencies” to include, among other entities, the state executive, judicial and legislative \nbranches, including the University of North Carolina system.  \n13.  H.B. 2 was enacted in direct response to Ordinance 7056 passed by the City \nCouncil in Charlotte, North Carolina (the “Charlotte Ordinance”), which permitted transgender \nindividuals to use facilities corresponding to their gender identity by prohibiting discrimination \nbased on “gender identity” in places of public accommodation.  \n14.  Governor McCrory and North Carolina legislators made explicit public statements \nindicating that they proposed, passed, and signed H.B. 2 to overturn the Charlotte Ordinance and \nto ensure transgender individuals would not be permitted to access bathrooms and other facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity in schools and other public agencies. \n15.  Prior to the passage of the Charlotte Ordinance in February 2016, Governor \nMcCrory told members of the Charlotte City Council that the Ordinance could “create major \npublic safety issues by putting citizens in possible danger from deviant actions by individuals \ntaking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  Governor McCrory went on to explain that the \n“action of allowing a person with male anatomy, for example, to use a female restroom or locker \nroom will most likely cause immediate State legislative intervention which I would support as \ngovernor.” \n16.  When State Representative Dan Bishop introduced H.B. 2, he stated that “[a] \nsmall group of far-out progressives should not presume to decide for us all that a cross-dresser’s \n-4- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 4 of 14\n\nliberty to express his gender nonconformity trumps the right of women and girls to peace of \nmind.”   \n17.  The bill passed both houses on March 23, 2016—the same day it was introduced.  \nGovernor McCrory signed the bill that night.  H.B. 2 took effect immediately. \n18.  Following the conclusion of the special session, Senate President Phil Berger \nstated on his website, “[t]he North Carolina Senate voted unanimously Wednesday [March 23, \n2016] to stop a radical and illegal Charlotte City Council ordinance allowing men into public \nbathrooms and locker rooms with young girls and women.”  Senator Berger characterized the \nCharlotte Ordinance as “dangerous” and claimed that it “created a loophole that any man with \nnefarious motives could use to prey on women and young children.”   \n19.  Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest stated that the Charlotte Ordinance “would have \ngiven pedophiles, sex offenders, and perverts free rein to watch women, boys, and girls undress \nand use the bathroom.”   \nDefendants’ Compliance with and Implementation of H.B. 2 and the United States’ \nResponse \n \n20.  On April 5, 2016, following the enactment of H.B. 2, Defendant University of \nNorth Carolina’s President, Margaret Spellings, issued a Memorandum to all Chancellors in the \nUniversity of North Carolina system, titled “Guidance – Compliance with the Public Facilities \nPrivacy & Security Act.”  The Memorandum directed Chancellors that “University institutions \nmust require every multiple-occupancy bathroom and changing facility to be designated for and \nused only by persons based on their biological sex.”  \n21.  As a federal funding agency, when the Department of Justice has reason to \nquestion a funding recipient’s compliance with Title IX, it gives notice of non-compliance and \nattempts to secure the recipient’s compliance through voluntary means. \n-5- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 5 of 14\n\n22.  On April 8, 2016, the United States sent a letter to President Spellings seeking \ninformation to determine whether the University was complying with federal law. \n23.  In a response dated April 13, 2016, President Spellings affirmed that “the \nUniversity is specifically covered by H.B. 2 and is required as a public agency to comply with its \napplicable portions, including the provisions related to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and \nchanging facilities.” \n24.  On April 12, 2016, Governor McCrory issued Executive Order 93, implementing \nH.B. 2 and affirming that “every multiple occupancy restroom, locker room or shower facility \nlocated in a cabinet agency must be designated for and only used by persons based on their \nbiological sex.”   \n25.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities on the University of North Carolina \ncampus are covered by the non-discrimination mandates of Title IX and VAWA. \n26.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities operated by Defendant North \nCarolina Department of Public Safety and its sub-recipients are covered by the non-\ndiscrimination mandate of VAWA.  \n27.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities in the workplace at public agencies in \nthe State of North Carolina is a term, condition and privilege of employment and, therefore, is \ncovered by the non-discrimination mandate of Title VII. \n28.  In letters dated May 4, 2016, the United States notified all Defendants, including \nthe University of North Carolina, that the United States had determined they were not in \ncompliance with Title VII, Title IX, and/or VAWA, based on their compliance with and \nimplementation of provisions of H.B. 2 that are irreconcilable with federal law.  The United \nStates requested that Defendants immediately agree not to comply with those provisions of H.B. \n-6- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 6 of 14\n\n2, ensure that transgender persons were entitled to use multiple-occupancy bathrooms and \nchanging facilities consistent with their gender identity as required by federal law, and retract \nany statements to the contrary. The United States advised Defendants that it would take \nenforcement action under the above statutes if such compliance with federal law was not \ndemonstrated. \n29.  As of the filing of this Complaint, no Defendant has taken steps to achieve that \ncompliance.    \nGender Identity and Its Relationship to Sex \n30.  Individuals are typically assigned a sex on their birth certificate solely on the \nbasis of the appearance of the external genitalia at birth.  Additional aspects of sex (for example, \nchromosomal makeup) typically are not assessed and considered at the time of birth, except in \ncases of infants born with ambiguous genitalia. \n31.  An individual’s “sex” consists of multiple factors, which may not always be in \nalignment.  Among those factors are hormones, external genitalia, internal reproductive organs, \nchromosomes, and gender identity, which is an individual’s internal sense of being male or \nfemale.  \n32.  For individuals who have aspects of their sex that are not in alignment, the \nperson’s gender identity is the primary factor in terms of establishing that person’s sex.  External \ngenitalia are, therefore, but one component of sex and not always determinative of a person’s \nsex. \n33.  Although there is not yet one definitive explanation for what determines gender \nidentity, biological factors, most notably sexual differentiation in the brain, have a role in gender \nidentity development.  \n-7- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 7 of 14\n\n34.  Transgender individuals are individuals who have a gender identity that does not \nmatch the sex they were assigned at birth.  A transgender man’s sex is male and a transgender \nwoman’s sex is female. \n35.  A transgender individual may begin to assert a gender identity inconsistent with \ntheir sex assigned at birth at any time from early childhood through adulthood.  The decision by \ntransgender individuals to assert their gender identity publicly is a deeply personal one that is \nmade by the individual, often in consultation with family, medical and health care providers, and \nothers.    \n36.  Gender identity is innate and external efforts to change a person’s gender identity \ncan be harmful to a person’s health and well-being.  \n37.  Gender identity and transgender status are inextricably linked to one’s sex and are \nsex-related characteristics. \n38.  Most states authorize changing the sex marker on one’s birth certificate, but the \nrequirements for doing so vary and are often onerous.  Specifically, many states require surgical \nprocedures.  At least one state does not allow persons to change the sex marker on their birth \ncertificates. \n39.  Individuals born in North Carolina must have proof of certain surgeries, such as \n“sex reassignment surgery,” in order to change the sex marker on their birth certificates.  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 130A-118(b)(4).   \n40.  Surgery related to gender transitioning is generally unavailable to children under \nage 18. \n41.  In addition, the great majority of transgender individuals do not have surgery as \npart of their gender transition.  Determinations about such surgery are decisions about medical \n-8- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425-TDS-JEP   Document 2   Filed 05/10/16   Page 8 of 14\n\ncare made by physicians and patients on an individual basis.  For some, health-related conditions \nor other medical criteria counsel against invasive surgery.  For others, the high cost of surgical \nprocedures, which are often excluded from health insurance coverage, present an insurmountable \nbarrier. \n42.    Standards of medical care for surgery related to gender transitioning generally \nadvise that transgender individuals present consistent with their gender identity on a day-to-day \nbasis across all settings of life, including in bathrooms and changing facilities at school and at \nwork, for a significant time period prior to undergoing surgery. \n \nImpact of H.B. 2 on Transgender Individuals in North Carolina \n \n43.  H.B. 2 requires public agencies to follow a facially discriminatory policy of \ntreating transgender individuals, whose gender identity may not match their birth certificates, \ndifferently from similarly situated non-transgender individuals.   \n44.  Because of Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2, non-\ntransgender employees of Defendants and of other public agencies in North Carolina may access \nbathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity in their places of \nwork, while transgender employees may not access bathrooms and changing facilities that are \nconsistent with their gender identity. \n45.

The United States files this complaint challenging a provision of North Carolina \nlaw requiring public agencies to deny transgender persons access to multiple-occupancy \nbathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity.   \n2.  As set forth below, Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of Part I of \nNorth Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (“H.B. 2”), which was enacted and became \neffective on March 23, 2016, constitutes a pattern or practice of employment discrimination on \nthe basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e, et seq. (“Title VII”); discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program \nreceiving federal funds in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”), and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 54 (2000), 34 \nC.F.R.

Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants are located \nwithin the Middle District of North Carolina and because a substantial part of the acts or \nomissions giving rise to this complaint arose from events occurring within this judicial district. \n5.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202; 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-6(a) and (b); 20 U.S.C. § \n1682; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 13925(b)(13)(C) and 3789d(c)(3). \nDEFENDANTS \n6.  Defendant State of North Carolina is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).   \n7.

It is a \n-2- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 2 of 14\n\nperson within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e(b).  It is currently and, at all times relevant to the Complaint, has been a recipient \nof federal funds from the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women, with open \ngrants dated after the reauthorization of VAWA on March 19, 2013.  As a condition of receiving \nfederal funds, Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety signed contract assurances \nagreeing that it will not discriminate in violation of federal law. \n9.  Defendant University of North Carolina is a public, multi-campus university that \nis organized under, and exists pursuant to, the laws of the State of North Carolina.  It is a person \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a) and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e(b). It is currently and, at all times relevant to the Complaint, has been a recipient of \nfederal funds from the United States Department of Justice, including the Office on Violence \nAgainst Women, with open grants dated after the reauthorization of VAWA on March 19, 2013.  \nAs a condition of receiving federal funds, Defendant University of North Carolina signed \ncontract assurances agreeing that it will not discriminate in violation of federal law. \n10.  Defendant Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina is the \ncorporate body charged with the general control, supervision, and governance of the University \nof North Carolina and is capable under North Carolina law of suing and being sued in any court. \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nEnactment of H.B. 2 \n11.  On March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature convened a special session for \nthe purpose of passing H.B. 2. \n-3- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 3 of 14\n\n12.  H.B. 2 mandates, inter alia, that all “[p]ublic agencies . . . require multiple \noccupancy bathrooms or changing facilities . . . be designated for and only used by individuals \nbased on their biological sex.”  H.B. 2 defines “biological sex” as “[t]he physical condition of \nbeing male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.”  H.B. 2 further defines \n“public agencies” to include, among other entities, the state executive, judicial and legislative \nbranches, including the University of North Carolina system.  \n13.  H.B. 2 was enacted in direct response to Ordinance 7056 passed by the City \nCouncil in Charlotte, North Carolina (the “Charlotte Ordinance”), which permitted transgender \nindividuals to use facilities corresponding to their gender identity by prohibiting discrimination \nbased on “gender identity” in places of public accommodation.  \n14.  Governor McCrory and North Carolina legislators made explicit public statements \nindicating that they proposed, passed, and signed H.B. 2 to overturn the Charlotte Ordinance and \nto ensure transgender individuals would not be permitted to access bathrooms and other facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity in schools and other public agencies. \n15.  Prior to the passage of the Charlotte Ordinance in February 2016, Governor \nMcCrory told members of the Charlotte City Council that the Ordinance could “create major \npublic safety issues by putting citizens in possible danger from deviant actions by individuals \ntaking improper advantage of a bad policy.”  Governor McCrory went on to explain that the \n“action of allowing a person with male anatomy, for example, to use a female restroom or locker \nroom will most likely cause immediate State legislative intervention which I would support as \ngovernor.” \n16.  When State Representative Dan Bishop introduced H.B. 2, he stated that “[a] \nsmall group of far-out progressives should not presume to decide for us all that a cross-dresser’s \n-4- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 4 of 14\n\nliberty to express his gender nonconformity trumps the right of women and girls to peace of \nmind.”   \n17.  The bill passed both houses on March 23, 2016—the same day it was introduced.  \nGovernor McCrory signed the bill that night.  H.B. 2 took effect immediately. \n18.  Following the conclusion of the special session, Senate President Phil Berger \nstated on his website, “[t]he North Carolina Senate voted unanimously Wednesday [March 23, \n2016] to stop a radical and illegal Charlotte City Council ordinance allowing men into public \nbathrooms and locker rooms with young girls and women.”  Senator Berger characterized the \nCharlotte Ordinance as “dangerous” and claimed that it “created a loophole that any man with \nnefarious motives could use to prey on women and young children.”   \n19.  Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest stated that the Charlotte Ordinance “would have \ngiven pedophiles, sex offenders, and perverts free rein to watch women, boys, and girls undress \nand use the bathroom.”   \nDefendants’ Compliance with and Implementation of H.B. 2 and the United States’ \nResponse \n \n20.  On April 5, 2016, following the enactment of H.B. 2, Defendant University of \nNorth Carolina’s President, Margaret Spellings, issued a Memorandum to all Chancellors in the \nUniversity of North Carolina system, titled “Guidance – Compliance with the Public Facilities \nPrivacy & Security Act.”  The Memorandum directed Chancellors that “University institutions \nmust require every multiple-occupancy bathroom and changing facility to be designated for and \nused only by persons based on their biological sex.”  \n21.  As a federal funding agency, when the Department of Justice has reason to \nquestion a funding recipient’s compliance with Title IX, it gives notice of non-compliance and \nattempts to secure the recipient’s compliance through voluntary means. \n-5- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 5 of 14\n\n22.  On April 8, 2016, the United States sent a letter to President Spellings seeking \ninformation to determine whether the University was complying with federal law. \n23.  In a response dated April 13, 2016, President Spellings affirmed that “the \nUniversity is specifically covered by H.B. 2 and is required as a public agency to comply with its \napplicable portions, including the provisions related to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and \nchanging facilities.” \n24.  On April 12, 2016, Governor McCrory issued Executive Order 93, implementing \nH.B. 2 and affirming that “every multiple occupancy restroom, locker room or shower facility \nlocated in a cabinet agency must be designated for and only used by persons based on their \nbiological sex.”   \n25.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities on the University of North Carolina \ncampus are covered by the non-discrimination mandates of Title IX and VAWA. \n26.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities operated by Defendant North \nCarolina Department of Public Safety and its sub-recipients are covered by the non-\ndiscrimination mandate of VAWA.  \n27.  Access to bathrooms and changing facilities in the workplace at public agencies in \nthe State of North Carolina is a term, condition and privilege of employment and, therefore, is \ncovered by the non-discrimination mandate of Title VII. \n28.  In letters dated May 4, 2016, the United States notified all Defendants, including \nthe University of North Carolina, that the United States had determined they were not in \ncompliance with Title VII, Title IX, and/or VAWA, based on their compliance with and \nimplementation of provisions of H.B. 2 that are irreconcilable with federal law.  The United \nStates requested that Defendants immediately agree not to comply with those provisions of H.B. \n-6- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 6 of 14\n\n2, ensure that transgender persons were entitled to use multiple-occupancy bathrooms and \nchanging facilities consistent with their gender identity as required by federal law, and retract \nany statements to the contrary. The United States advised Defendants that it would take \nenforcement action under the above statutes if such compliance with federal law was not \ndemonstrated. \n29.  As of the filing of this Complaint, no Defendant has taken steps to achieve that \ncompliance.    \nGender Identity and Its Relationship to Sex \n30.  Individuals are typically assigned a sex on their birth certificate solely on the \nbasis of the appearance of the external genitalia at birth.  Additional aspects of sex (for example, \nchromosomal makeup) typically are not assessed and considered at the time of birth, except in \ncases of infants born with ambiguous genitalia. \n31.  An individual’s “sex” consists of multiple factors, which may not always be in \nalignment.  Among those factors are hormones, external genitalia, internal reproductive organs, \nchromosomes, and gender identity, which is an individual’s internal sense of being male or \nfemale.  \n32.  For individuals who have aspects of their sex that are not in alignment, the \nperson’s gender identity is the primary factor in terms of establishing that person’s sex.  External \ngenitalia are, therefore, but one component of sex and not always determinative of a person’s \nsex. \n33.  Although there is not yet one definitive explanation for what determines gender \nidentity, biological factors, most notably sexual differentiation in the brain, have a role in gender \nidentity development.  \n-7- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 7 of 14\n\n34.  Transgender individuals are individuals who have a gender identity that does not \nmatch the sex they were assigned at birth.  A transgender man’s sex is male and a transgender \nwoman’s sex is female. \n35.  A transgender individual may begin to assert a gender identity inconsistent with \ntheir sex assigned at birth at any time from early childhood through adulthood.  The decision by \ntransgender individuals to assert their gender identity publicly is a deeply personal one that is \nmade by the individual, often in consultation with family, medical and health care providers, and \nothers.    \n36.  Gender identity is innate and external efforts to change a person’s gender identity \ncan be harmful to a person’s health and well-being.  \n37.  Gender identity and transgender status are inextricably linked to one’s sex and are \nsex-related characteristics. \n38.  Most states authorize changing the sex marker on one’s birth certificate, but the \nrequirements for doing so vary and are often onerous.  Specifically, many states require surgical \nprocedures.  At least one state does not allow persons to change the sex marker on their birth \ncertificates. \n39.  Individuals born in North Carolina must have proof of certain surgeries, such as \n“sex reassignment surgery,” in order to change the sex marker on their birth certificates.  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 130A-118(b)(4).   \n40.  Surgery related to gender transitioning is generally unavailable to children under \nage 18. \n41.  In addition, the great majority of transgender individuals do not have surgery as \npart of their gender transition.  Determinations about such surgery are decisions about medical \n-8- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 8 of 14\n\ncare made by physicians and patients on an individual basis.  For some, health-related conditions \nor other medical criteria counsel against invasive surgery.  For others, the high cost of surgical \nprocedures, which are often excluded from health insurance coverage, present an insurmountable \nbarrier. \n42.    Standards of medical care for surgery related to gender transitioning generally \nadvise that transgender individuals present consistent with their gender identity on a day-to-day \nbasis across all settings of life, including in bathrooms and changing facilities at school and at \nwork, for a significant time period prior to undergoing surgery. \n \nImpact of H.B. 2 on Transgender Individuals in North Carolina \n \n43.  H.B. 2 requires public agencies to follow a facially discriminatory policy of \ntreating transgender individuals, whose gender identity may not match their birth certificates, \ndifferently from similarly situated non-transgender individuals.   \n44.  Because of Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2, non-\ntransgender employees of Defendants and of other public agencies in North Carolina may access \nbathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity in their places of \nwork, while transgender employees may not access bathrooms and changing facilities that are \nconsistent with their gender identity. \n45.  Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 stigmatizes and \nsingles out transgender employees, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a \nsense that they are not worthy of equal treatment and respect. \n46.  Upon information and belief, transgender employees of Defendants and other \npublic agencies in North Carolina have suffered and continue to suffer injury, including, without \n-9- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 9 of 14\n\nlimitation, emotional harm, mental anguish, distress, humiliation, and indignity as a direct and \nproximate result of Defendants’ compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2. \n47.  Because of the compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants \nUniversity of North Carolina and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, \nindividuals who are not transgender may access campus bathrooms and changing facilities that \nare consistent with their gender identity, while individuals who are transgender may not access \ncampus bathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity. \n48.  The compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants University of \nNorth Carolina and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina stigmatizes and \nsingles out transgender individuals, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a \nsense that they are not worthy of equal treatment and respect. \n49.  Upon information and belief, transgender individuals seeking access to the \nUniversity of North Carolina campus have suffered and continue to suffer injury, including, \nwithout limitation, emotional harm, mental anguish, distress, humiliation, and indignity as a \ndirect and proximate result of compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2. \n50.  Because of the compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants \nNorth Carolina Department of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, and Board of \nGovernors of the University of North Carolina, individuals who are not transgender may access \nbathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity in covered \nfacilities, while individuals who are transgender may not access bathrooms and changing \nfacilities that are consistent with their gender identity. \n51.  The compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants North Carolina \nDepartment of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, and Board of Governors of the \n-10- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 10 of 14\n\nUniversity of North Carolina stigmatizes and singles out transgender individuals seeking access \nto covered facilities, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a sense that they are \nnot worthy of equal treatment and respect. \n52.  Upon information and belief, transgender individuals seeking access to covered \nfacilities have suffered and continue to suffer injury, including, without limitation, emotional \nharm, mental anguish, distress, humiliation, and indignity as a direct and proximate result of \ncompliance with and implementation of H.B. 2. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I  \n \nViolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n53.  As alleged in this Complaint, Defendants State of North Carolina, North Carolina \nDepartment of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, and Board of Governors of the \nUniversity of North Carolina are engaged in, and continue to engage in, a pattern or practice of \nsex discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment against their \ntransgender employees in violation Title VII.  \n54.  As alleged in this Complaint, Defendants State of North Carolina and Governor \nMcCrory have engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of employment \nrights under Title VII by implementing and requiring compliance with policies and practices that \nrequire public agencies to discriminate against their transgender employees based on sex in the \nterms, conditions, and privileges of employment in violation of Title VII.  \n-11- \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00425   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 11 of 14\n\nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n(Against Defendants University of North Carolina and Board of Governors of the University of \nNorth Carolina) \n \n55.  As alleged in this Complaint, Defendants University of North Carolina and Board \nof Governors of the University of North Carolina are discriminating on the basis of sex in \nviolation of Title IX. \n    COUNT III  \n \nViolation of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”) \n42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13) \n(Against Defendants North Carolina Department of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, \nand Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina) \n \n56.
