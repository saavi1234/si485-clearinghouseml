      "text": "590  F.Supp.  1310 \nUnited  States  District  Court, \nN.D.  Texas, \nDallas  Division. \nR.A. J.,  et  al.  Plaintiffs, \nVv. \nGary  E.  MILLER,  M.D.,  et  al.  Defendants, \nand \nUnited  States  of America  Amicus  Curiae. \nCiv.  A.  No.  3-74-02394-H. \nApril  2,  1984. \nPlaintiffs  representing  patients  at  eight  state  mental  hospitais  in  Texas \nbrought  an  action  alleging  failure  to  comply  with  a  settlement  agreement. \nThe  District  Court,  Sanders,  J.,  held  that  the  Texas  Department  of  Mental \nHealth  and  Mental  Retardation  failed  to  comply,  or  insufficiently  complied, \nwith  several  major  portions  of  settlement  agreemeni. \nOrdered  accordingly. \nMEMORANDUM  OPINION  AND  ORDER \nSANDERS,  District  Judge. \nPlaintiffs  in  this  case  represent  the  patients  at  eight  state  mental  hospitals \n(Austin,  Big  Spring,  Kerrville,  San  Antonio,  Rusk,  Terrell,  Vernon,  and \nWichita  Falls);  Defendants  are  the  representatives  of  the  Texas \nDepartment  of  Mental  Health  and  Mental  Retardation  CTDMHMR’):  the \nUnited  States  is  amicus  curiae.  The  R.A.J.  Review  Panel,  established  by \nthis  Court  on  April  22,  1982,  pursuant  to  the  Settlement  Agreement  (“the \nAgreement’)  filed  March  2,  1981  (approved  by  the  Court  on  April  3,  19871), \nfiled  its  Third  Report  (“the  Report’)  to  the  Court  on  December  1,  1983.  The \nReport  states  that  Defencants  are  not  complying  with  the  Settlement \nAgreement  in  several  significant  areas.  The  Court  held  an  evidentiary \nhearing  on  the  Panel's  allegations  on  February  3,  1984. \n1 \nThe  Court  finds  that  Defendants  have  failed  to  comply,  or  have \ninsufficiently  complied,  with  several  major  provisions  of  the  Agreement.  The \nareas  of  noncompliance  inciude: \n1.  Failure  to  adequately  plan  and  document  individualized  treatment; \n2.  Failure  to  adequately  protect  patients  from  harm;  and \n3.  Failure  to  provide  sufficient  staff  to  ensure  minimally  adequate  patient\ncare. \nBackground \nThis  litigation,  in  progress  for  nearly  ten  years,  began  with  the  filing  of  the \nComplaint  in  April  1974.  The  case  was  transferred  to  this  Court  in  1979.  On \nMarch  2,  1981,  the  parties  and  the  United  States  entered  into  a  Settlement \nAgreement  which  provided  for  the  creation  of  an  independent  Review \nPanel  (the  Panel’)  whose  primary  function  is  to  monitor  compliance  with \nthe  Settlement.  (Agreement,  p.  6.)  The  Panel,  “372  established  by  Charter \non  April  22,  1982,  is  composed  of  three  members  selected  by  unanimous \nagreement  of  the  parties. \nThe  Charter  empowers  the  Panel  to  approve  implementation  plans  and \nproposed  modifications  to  the  Rules  of  the  Commissioner.  (Charter,  p.  4.) \nBy  creating  the  Panel,  the  parties  and  the  United  States  intended  to \nminimize  the  need  for  the  Court's  participation  in  the  supervision  of  the \nAgreement  and  plans  of  implementation;  provision  was  made  in  the \nAgreement,  however,  for  bringing  any  compliance  matter  to  the  attention  of \nthe  Court,  as  the  Panel  has  now  done  in  its  Third  Report.  (Agreement,  p. \n8.)  The  Report  alleges  noncompliance  in  four  broad  areas  of  concern:  (1) \nIndividualized  Treatment;  (2)  Protection  from  Harm;  (3)  Adequate  Staffing; \nand  (4)  Placement  of  the  Mentally  Retarded  Population.  The  Court  will \naddress  each  of  these  areas  seriatim. \nIndividualized  Treatment \nThe  sections  of  the  Agreement  that  are  pertinent  to  this  issue  provide  as \nfollows: \nV.  Patient  Rights \n1.  All  patients  shall  have  the  right  to  individualized  treatment  planning  by \nqualified  and  competent  menial  health  professionals....  Each  Treatment \nPian  shall  fully  describe  the  patient's  diagnosis,  specific  problems  and \nspecific  needs.  it  shall  also  contain  a  description  of  the  short  and  long-term \ntreatment  goals,  and  a  projected  timetable  for  their  attainment....  The \nindividualized  Treatment  Plan  shall  be  a  part  of  the  patient's  permanent \nmedical  record  and  shail  be  reviewed  and  modified  on  a  reqular  basis. \n2.  Patients  have  the  right  to  have  sufficient  staff available  to  provide \nadequate  individualized  treatment  planning  and  programming.... \nspecifically,  the  defendants  shall  provide  adequate  staff  support  to  make \navailable  to  all  patients  an  average  of  thirty  (30)  hours  per  week  of \nappropriate  planned  or  scheduled  activities  related  to  the  patient's \nTreatment  Plan  and  the  Unit  Treatment  Program.  However,  this  provision \nshail  not  apply  to: \na.  Geriatric  and  other  patients  who,  as  fully  documented  in  the  patient's\nrecord,  are  medically  or  psychiatrically  unable  to  participate  in  the  thirty \n(30)  hours  of  planned  activities;  .... \n15.  Patients  shall  be  entitled  to  be  treated  and  addressed  in  a  dignified \nmanner. \nVi.  E.  Programming  for  Geriatric  and  Patients  in  the  General  Population. \n1.  Defendants  shall  take  appropriate  action  to  provide  geriatric  and  general \npopulation  patients  with  meaningful,  professionally  recognized, \npsychological  and  recreational  programming....  Within  ninety  days  of  the \nentry  of  this  Settlement  Agreement  a  pian  shall  be  developed  for  patient \nprogramming  which  sets  forth  scheduled  activities  for  each  unit  described \nin  terms  of  duration,  frequency,  objectives  and  staff  responsibility.... \n(Agreement,  pp.  10,  11,  14,  24  (emphasis  added).} \nDefendants’  plan  for  implementing  the  requirements  of  V(1)  &  (2)  above \nhas  been  accepted  by  the  Panel  on  the  condition  that  the  standards  therein \nbe  measured  by  the  Problem-Oriented  Record  System  (PORS’\")  on  a \ncase-by-case  basis.  (Report,  p.  11.)  Although  the  Department  utilizes  the \nPORS,  the  hospitals  generally  fail  to  use  the  system  correctly;  that  is,  client \nproblems  are  not  being  defined  by  treatment  staff  in  a  way  that  allows \nspecific  treatment  interventions  to  be  identified  and  utilized.  In  a  review  of \n217  patient  records  the  Panel  noted  a  failure  by  staff  to  clearly  state \nproblems  as  required  by  the  use  of  the  PORS.  The  Panel  further  noted  a \ngeneralized  failure  to  differentiate  skills,  strengths  and  weaknesses  of \npatients  in  understandable  language  that  is  useful  to  all  mental  health  staff. \n(Report,  p.  12;  “Y39s  Transcript  of  Hearing  (Tr.\"},  po.  9,  10-711,  38,  49,  50, \n55,  59,  65~-66.) \nSpecifically,  the  Panel  reported: \nThe  Review  Panel  has  become  increasingly  concerned  about  the \neffectiveness  of  the  treatment  which  patients  are  receiving.  In  the  previous \ntwo  Reports  to  the  Court,  the  Panel  has  expressed  concern  about  the  lack \nof  individualization  of  problem  descriptions,  the  broadness  of  a  problem \ndescription,  and  the  formulaic  approach  to  treatment  strategies....  [T]he \nReview  Panel  has  concluded  that  for  the  most  part,  patient  records  do  not \nrefiect  thoughtful  probiem  identifications  followed  by  thoughtful  intervention \nprograms....  In  most  units,  every  patient  has  the  same  set  of  interventions \nprescribed,  regardiess  of  the  nature  of  the  problem  described....  Far  too \noften,  the  interventions  do  not  appear  to  logically  relate  to  the  problem.... \n(Report,  pp.  16-17.)  Defendants’  witness  Tracy  R.  Gordy  acknowledged \nthat  a  recent  survey  of  Austin  State  Hospital  by  the  National  Institute  of \nMental  Health  noted  serious  deficiencies  with  respect  to  treatment \nplanning.  (Tr.,  pp.  1449-50.)  The  Panel  also  expressed  concern  about  the\nnumber  of  hours  spent  in  primarily  recreational,  as  opposed  to  therapeutic \nactivities,  (Repori,  p.  18),  and  the  frequency  with  which  programming  is \naimed  at  the  lowest  level  of  functioning.  (/d.,  pp.  18-19.)  Thus,  although  the \nhospitals  are  making  strides  toward  satisfying  the  thirty-hour  requirement, \nthe  Panel  has  serious  reservations  about  the  relevance  and  meaning  of \nmuch  of  the  scheduled  programming.  After  considering  the  quidelines  set \nforth  in  the  Agreement  and  in  the  Defendants’  implementation  plan,  as  weil \nas  those  adopted  by  the  Joint  Committee  on  Accreditation  of  Hospitals \n(JCAH\")  and  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  (ONIMH\"),  the  Panel \nwas  of  the  view  that  Defendants  are  not  in  compliance  with  Sections  V(1)  & \n(2)  of  the  Agreement.  (Report,  p.  12.) \nDefendants  dispute  this  conclusion.  Dr.  Miller,  Commissioner  of  the  Texas \nDepartment  of  Mental  Health  and  Mental  Retardation  CTDMHMR’)  agreed \nthat,  in  principle,  treatment  should  be  based  on  a  patient's  individual \nproblems.  (Tr.,  p.  75.)  He  and  Dr.  Gordy  both  felt  that  the  Department \nrecord-keeping  procedures  were  generally  adequate  in  this  regard;  use  of \nshorthand  diagnostic  language,  in  their  view,  adequately  alerts  staff \nmembers  to  the  problems  and  treatments  required  by  each  patient.  Messrs. \nMiller  and  Gordy  say  that  Patient  records,  therefore,  are  sufficiently \nindividualized.  (Tr.,  pp.  76,  136-40.)  Dr.  Miller  went  on  to  testify,  however, \nthat  for  many  patients  there  is  no  rationale  for  choosing  specific \ninterventions  to  specific  treatment  problems.  (Tr.,  p.  86.)  Dr.  Miller  believes \nthat  the  administration  of  neurolyptic  medication  is  the  only  effective \ntreatment  for  schizophrenia  (Tr.,  p.  81);  in  his  view,  the  use  of  lithium \ncarbonate  is  of  similar  importance  in  the  treatment  of  affective  disorders. \n(Tr.,  p.  88.)  For  patients  with  these  disorders,  he  suggests,  all  forms  of \npsycho-social  therapy  are  indistinguishable  and,  in  any  case,  of  limited \nutility.  In  his  view,  the  same  result  is  achieved  no  matter  what  the  nature  of \nthe  treatment  or  the  number  of  staff  participating.  (Tr.,  p.  82.) \nIn  essence,  Dr.  Miller's  testimony,  as  well  as  the  other  testimony  offered  by \nDefendants  on  this  issue,  (see  testimony  of  Tracy  Gordy,  M.D.,  and \nDefendants’  Exhibits  12-15),  reflects  a  rejection  of  the  scientific  basis  for \nindividualized  treatment  planning  and  programming.  The  Court  expresses \nno  opinion  on  the  relative  merits  of  the  various  philosophical  approaches  to \nthe  treatment  of  mental  disorders.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  Dr. \nMiller's  testimony  specifically  addressed  only  the  treatment  of \nschizophrenia  and  certain  affective  disorders,  which  account  for  less  than \none-half  of  the  client  population  of  the  hospitals.  (Tr.,  p.  148.)  In  any  case, \nthis  litigation  is  now  in  the  enforcement  stage.  The  terms  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement,  not  the  opinions  of  the  parties,  control.  The  Agreement,  freely\nentered  into  by  Defendants  and  judicially  enforceable,  provides  that \npatients  have  the  right  to  individualized  treatment  planning,  including  full \n“3378  descriptions  of  the  patients’  specific  problems  and  specific  needs. \n(Agreement,  Section  V(1).)  The  Agreement  further  requires  that \nDefendants  provide  patients  with  meaningful,  professionally  recognized, \npsychological  and  recreational  programming.  (/d.,  Section  VI(E)  (emphasis \nadded).) \nAll  three  semi-annual  reports  submitted  by  the  Panel  to  this  Court  have \nexpressed  dissatisfaction  with  Defendants’  compliance  with  the \nindividualized  treatment  requirement  of  the  Agreement.  (See  First  Report, \nfiled  November  30,  1982,  pp.  5-8;  Second  Report,  filed  May  12,  1983,  pp. \n15-19;  Third  Report,  flec  December  1,  1983,  pp.  16-20.)  The  Court \nagrees  with  the  Panel's  opinion  that  “the  individualization  of  treatment \nplanning  and  programming  is  at  the  heart  of  the  program  requirements  of \nthe  Settlement  Agreement.”  (Second  Report,  p.  12.)  Defendants’ \ndisagreement  with  the  wisdom  of  this  requirement,  which  they  accepted  in \n1981,  is  no  excuse  for  noncompliance. \ntis  clear,  and  the  Court  concludes,  that  Defencants  are  not  complying  with \nthese  provisions  of  the  Settlement  Agreement.  Specifically,  the  Court  finds \nas  follows: \n1.  Defendants  have  failed  to  correctly  utilize  the  Problem  Oriented  Records \nsystem;  problem  statements  are  often  meaningless  and  do  not  facilitate  the \nidentification  of  specific  treatment  interventions. \n2.  interventions  are  often  not  clearly  aimed  at  addressing  the  problem \nstatement,  nor  are  they  sufficiently  geared  to  the  individual  patient. \n3.  Arecent  survey  of  Austin  State  Hospital  by  the  National  institute  of \nMental  Health  also  noted  serious  deficiencies  with  respect  fo  treatment \nplanning.  (Tr.,  p.  59.) \n4,  Defencanis'  reliance  on  the  point/level  system  in  most  general \npsychiatric  units  fails  to  provide  suitable  treatment  and  programming  for \npatients  who  function  at  higher  levels,  and  frequently  discourages  progress \nin  those  who  function  at  lower  levels.  In  some  units,  moreover,  patients \nwho  refuse  to  participate  in  this  method  of  programming  are  denied  suitable \nalternative  programming.  (Tr.,  pp.  14-16.) \nFinally,  before  turning  to  the  next  area  of  concern,  the  Court  will  address \nthe  interpretation  of  the  thirty-hour  programming  requirement  contained  in \nSection  V(2}  of  the  Agreement.  Although  not  all  of  the  hospitals  are \ncomplying  with  this  requirement,  the  Panel  feels  that  they  are  attempting  to \ndo  so.  Defendants  offered  testimony,  however,  suggesting  that  aggregate \naverages  on  a  hospital  or  state-wide  basis  would  satisfy  the  thirty-hour\nrequirement.  (Tr.,  p.  161.)  The  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  this  is  an \nunreasonable  interpretation  of  the  Agreement.  Section  V(2)  specifically \nstates  that  an  average  of  thirty  hours  of  programming  per  week  must  be \nmade  availabie  to  a//  patients  except  those  who  are  medically  or \npsychiatrically  unable  to  participate.  Generalized  exceptions  exist  for \ngeriatric  patients,  medical-surgical  wards,  and  transitional  living  units. \nWithout  documentation  in  the  patient's  record  by  appropriate  and  qualified \nprofessionals  of  the  need  for  individual  exceptions,  however,  Defendants \nmay  not  refuse  to  comply  with  this  provision  of  the  Agreement. \nProtection  From  Harm \nThe  following  sections  of  the  Agreement  are  pertinent  to  this  issue: \nV.  2.  (reprinted  above) \n16.  Patients  shail  be  entitled  to  reside  in  facilities  which  are  environmentally \nclean  and  safe.... \nAfter  having  received  several  compiaints  of  incidents  of  violence  in  the \nState  Hospitals,  the  Panel  conducted  an  investigation.  (Tr.,  pp.  20-21.)  The \ninvestigation  focused  upon  the  type  of  violence,  the  staff  response  to  the \nsituation,  and  the  extent  to  which  violent  behavior  had  been  addressed  in \nthe  patient's  individual  treatment  plan.  The  review  included  only  acts  of \npatient  violence,  such  as  hitting,  fighting,  breaking  windows,  and  the  like. \nDuring  the  period  August  1  through  September  15,  1983,  102  of  278 \npatients  whose  records  were  reviewed  “J373  by  the  Panel  were  violent \naccording  to  descriptive  incidents  set  forth  in  their  records.  (Report,  p.  24; \nTr.,  pp.  20-22.)  Violence  was  identified  as  a  problem,  however,  in  the \ntreatment  plans  for  only  60%  of  these  patients.  (Tr.,  p.  22.)  Many  of  the \ninstances  of  patient  violence  noted  by  the  Panel  were  indeed  severe, \nincluding  one  recent  instance  in  which  a  patient's  eyes  were  gouged  out  by \nanother  patient.  (Tr.,  p.  40.)  Other  indicia  of  harm,  not  all  of  which  are \nrelated  to  violent  acts,  is  demonstrated  by  records  reflecting  staff  and \npatient  injuries.  On  average  throughout  TOMHMR  hospitals  there  are \napproximately  800  patient  injuries  per  month  and  approximately  300  staff \ninjuries.  (Tr.,  pp.  25,  159,  186.) \nIn  the  opinion  of  witnesses  for  Defendant  TDMHMR,  the  Panel  unfairly \nequates  patient  injury  with  patient  violence  and  does  not  offer  any \nstandards  for  determining  whether  violence  and  injury  are  excessive  in \nTexas  state  hospitals.  (Tr.,  pp.  100-03,  185.)  One  of  Defendants’ \nwitnesses  also  minimized  the  importance  of  some  of  the  reported  violent \nbehavior  by  noting  that  the  incidents  were  only  “acting  out”  behavior.  (Tr., \npo.  144-46.)  This  criticism,  however,  fails  to  recognize  that  “acting  out\"\nbehavior  may  escalate  to  serious  injury.  Moreover,  because  the  Panel \ndisregarded  “acting  out’  behavior  that  did  not  result  in  documented \naggressive  violent  acts  or  injury,  its  report  may  actually  underestimate  the \namount  of  threatening  behavior  and  violence  in  the  hospitals. \nThe  Panel's  survey  was  limited  and  did  not  refine  available  data  to  the \nextent  demanded  by  Defendants;  the  results,  therefore,  may  indeed  be \ninflated.  Nevertheless,  based  upon  their  review  of  the  literature  and  their \nprofessional  experience,  the  Panel  members  unanimously  concluded  that \npatient  violence  and  injury  are  excessive  in  the  hospitals  and  can  be \nsignificantly  reduced.  (Tr.,  pp.  41-42,  56-58,  66-68.)  Certainly,  violent \nbehavior  by  mental  patients  is  neither  unknown  nor  unexpected;  for  this \nvery  reason,  however,  the  hospitals  must  be  prepared  to  deal  with  violent \nincidents  and  reduce  injuries  to  a  minimum.  The  Panel  found  very  little \nevidence,  however,  that  the  hospitals  are  adequately  responding  to  these \nincidents  or  adopting  strategies  designed  to  minimize  their  frequency  and \nseverity.  (Report,  p.  26.) \nWithin  general  psychiatric  units,  the  responses  to  violent  behavior  are \nprimarily  reactive,  such  as  injections  of  medications,  seclusion  of  the  violent \npatients,  and  the  training  of  staff  in  restraint  and  escape  holds.  Moreover, \non  these  units  behavior  was  only  infrequently  addressed  as  a  problem  in \nthe  patients’  treatment  plans;  by  contrast,  in  programs  with  a  strong \nbehavior  modification  format,  treatment  plans  more  often  contained \nstrategies  for  eliminating  violent  or  aggressive  tendencies.  (Report,  pp.  24— \n29.)  The  Panel  concluded  that: \n[Tine  records  at  ail  the  eight  hospitals  reflect  little  evidence  of  the  staff's \ntrying  to  understand  and  address  what  had  caused  or  provoked  the  violent \nbehavior....  The  fact  that  this  attention  to  the  dynamics  and  meaning  of \nbehavior  is  lacking  in  the  general  psychiatric  units  is  unacceptable  to  the \nReview  Panel. \nReport,  p.  26. \nIn  the  Court's  opinion,  the  deficiencies  in  Defendants’  responses  to  violent \nbehavior  are  related  to  their  failure  to  comply  with  the  individualized \ntreatment  requirements  of  the  Agreement.  Defendants  have  a  responsibility \nunder  Sections  V(1),  (2)  and  (16)  to  adequately  assess  and  treat  violent \nbehavior.  Efforts  must  also  be  made,  through  the  development  of  treatment \nstrategies,  to  prevent  or  minimize  the  necessity  for  administering \npsychotropic  medications  to  control  violent  behavior  once  it  has  erupted. \n(Agreement,  Section  Vi(B)(1).)  Because  of  the  excessive  number  of \nincidents  of  violence  as  well  as  Defendants’  failure  to  adequately  prepare \nfor  and  respond  to  these  incidents,  the  Court  finds  that  Defendants  are  not\nin  compliance  with  Sections  V(2)  and  V(16)  of  the  Settlement  Agreement. \nAdequate  Staffing \nThe  following  sections  of  the  Agreement  are  pertinent  to  this  issue: \n“F376  V.  2.  (reprinted  above) \n16.  (reprinted  above) \nPanel  member  James  K.  Peden,  M.D.,  testified  that,  since  violence  is  more \nlikely  to  occur  in  an  unstructured  environment,  the  development  of \nmeaningful  programming  and  strategies  of  treatment  can  lead  toa \nreduction  in  the  frequency  of  violent  episodes.  (Tr.,  pp.  65-67.)  He \nrecognized,  however,  that  this  cannot  be  accomplished  without  adequate \nstaffing.  (Tr.,  p.  66.)  Although  Defendant  TOMHMR  has  requested  funds  for \nadequate  staffing,  the  number  of  staff  authorized  by  the  Legislature  is \ninsufficient  to  meet  even  the  minimum  requirements  of  the  Settlement. \nData  compiled  by  the  Panel  on  patient-to-staff  ratios  reveal  severe \ndeficiencies.  On  the  11:00  P.M.  to  7:00  A.M.  shift,  the  ratios  vary  from  a  low \nof  approximately  7:1  (that  is,  7  patients  to  1  staff)  at  Kerrville  State  Hospital \nto  a  high  of  20:1  at  San  Antonio  State  Hospital.  (Report,  p.  64.)  In  addition, \nreports  of  ward  coverage  by  only  one  mental  health  worker  are  not \nuncommon.  (Report,  p.  69.)  A  Panel  survey  disclosed  that  in  August  1983, \n?f  of  124  wards  had  shifts  which  were  staffed  by  only  one  person.  (Tr.,  p. \n28.)  in  the  Panel's  professional  judgment,  absolute  minimum  ratios  for  the \nmaintenance  of  a  safe  environment  are  5:1  between  the  hours  of  7:00  A.M. \nand  11:00  P.M.  and  10:1  between  11:00  P.M.  and  7:00  A.M.  (Report,  p. \n29.)  In  order  to  achieve  these  ratios,  the  number  of  mental  health  workers \nwould  have  to  be  increased  by  1,198.  if  the  number  of  mental  health \nworkers  in  the  hospitals  is  not  increased,  1,121  patients,  or  44%  of  the \nhospitals’  patient  population  as  of  August  1983,  would  have  to  be  released \nin  order  to  achieve  the  minimum  ratios.  (Tr.,  p.  61.). \nAs  the  source  of  the  5:1/10:1  ratios,  the  Panel  cites  standards  developed \nby  Defendant  TDMHMR's  mental  health  division  in  connection  with  tts \nbudget  requests.  Although  Defendants  denied  the  existence  of  any  such \nstandards,  (Tr.,  pp.  172~—73),  they  in  fact  recognized  the  urgent  need  for \nincreased  staffing  by  requesting  824  additional  positions  from  the  1983 \nLegisiature.  (Tr.,  p.  179.) \nThe  Court  adopts  the  recommendation  of  the  Panel  with  respect  to \nnecessary  staff.  Defendants  have  not  come  forward  with  their  own \npreferred  ratios  for  General  Psychiatric  Units  (“GPU's”),  but  the  ratios \ndeveloped  by  them  for  the  Multiple  Disabilities  Units  (MDWU's”)  closely \napproximate  the  ratios  suggested  by  the  Panel  for  GPU's.  Defendants’\nImplementation  Plan  for  MDU's  calls  for  a  4:1  patient-to-worker  ratio \nbetween  7:00  A.M.  and  11:00  P.M.,  and  a  &:1  ratio  for  11:00  P.M.  to  7:00 \nA.M.  Goal  Statement  for  Multiple  Disabilities  Units,  4(4)(13).  In  any  event, \nthe  Court  finds  that  current  ratios  are  not  acceptable.  It  is  clear  fram  the \nevidence  that  inadequate  staffing  levels  contribute  to  deficiencies  in \nindividualized  treatment  and  protection  from  harm.  The  result  is \nnoncompliance  with  the  Settlement  Agreement.  Finally,  reported  instances \nof  zero  and  single-worker  ward  coverage  are  totally  unacceptable.  Single \nstaffing  provides  additional  opportunity  for  unchecked  violent  behavior, \nplaces  staff  at  risk,  and  denies  patients  adequate  protection  from  harm \nfrom  themselves  or  others.  Single  staff  person  coverage  of  a  ward  is \ndangerous  and  under  no  circumstances  should  a  staff  member  be  on  duty \nalone.  (Tr.,  pp.  26,  26-29,  66-67.) \nPlacement  of  the  Mentally  Retarded  Population \nThe  following  sections  of  the  Agreement  are  pertinent  to  the  discussion  of \nthis  issue: \nVI.  D.  Mentally  Retarded  Patients \n1.  No  person  who  is  determined  to  be  mentally  retarded  ...  shall  be \nadmitted  to  any  psychiatric  facility  except  in  accordance  with  the  Rules  of \nthe  Commissioner  ...  and  unless  the  following  factors  are  present  in  order \nto  justify  admission: \na.  Indication  of  dangerousness  to  self  or  others  of  sufficient  magnitude  as \nto  indicate  an  inability  to  function  in  a  non-institutional  psychiatric  setting; \n“37%  b.  Need  for  planned  psychiatric,  medical,  social,  or  psychological \nevaluation  and  treatment,  special  drug  therapy,  treatment  requiring \nhospitalization,  or  continuous  skilled  observation  which  is  not  available  in  a \nfacility  whose  primary  mission  is  care  and  training  of  retarded  individuals. \n2.  No  mentally  retarded  person,  ...  admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital \npursuant  to  paragraph  1  above,  shall  remain  in  the  hospital  for  a  period  of \ntime  longer  than  that  necessary  to  alleviate  the  condition  which \nnecessitated  the  patient's  admission  to  the  State  Hospital  .... \n3.  Mentally  retarded  persons  who  are  residents  in  State  Hospitals  and  can \nbenefit  from  less  restrictive  alternatives  shall  be  placed  in  State  Schools  or \nCommunity  Intermediate  Facilities  in  accordance  with  the  Rules  of  the \nCommissioner  .... \n7.  Within  ninety  days  from  the  date  of  the  entry  of  this  Settlement \nAgreement  the  defendants  shall  submit  a  Plan  of  Implementation  for \nplacement  of  mentally  retarded  persons  currently  in  State  Hospitals  who  no \nlonger  have  psychiatric  diagnosis.  Such  clients  will  be  placed  in  facilities  for\nthe  mentally  retarded  in  the  least  restrictive  setting  appropriate  to  their \nneeds.  All  such  clients  shall  be  placed  in  an  appropriate  facility  or \ndischarged  within  one  year  from  the  submission  of  the  Plan  of \nimplementation.  This  plan  will  also  provide  for  implementing  the  timetable \nwithin  which  persons  referred  to  in  paragraphs  1  and  2  above  shail  be \nplaced  in  appropriate  facilities  for  the  mentally  retarded  or  shail  be \ndischarged. \n8.  After  September  1,  1987,  in  the  event  a  mentally  retarded  patient  is \ncommitted  to  a  State  Hospital  under  the  Mental  Health  Code  and  a \nTreatment  Team  determines  that  such  commitment  is  inappropriate \nbecause  the  patient  is  not  mentally  ill,  the  hospital  shall,  not  later  than  forty- \nlive  days  after  this  diagnostic  determination  has  been  made,  secure  an \nappropriate  non-psychiatric  placement  in  the  least  restrictive  setting  or \ndischarge  the  patient. \n9.  After  September  1,  1987,  when  a  Treatment  Team  determines  that  a \nmentally  retarded  patient  ...  is  no  longer  in  need  of  State  Hospital  care  ... \nthe  hospital  shall,  not  later  than  forty-five  days  after  this  diagnostic \ndetermination  has  been  made,  secure  an  appropriate  non-psychiatric \nplacement  ...  or  discharge  the  patient. \nsection  Vi(D)  has  been  difficult  to  implement.  (Tr.,  p.  204.)  The  Panel  and \nthe  Court  are  aware  of  the  sensitive  political,  social,  and  moral  dilemmas \nattendant  to  the  proper  placement  of  mentally  retarded  persons \ninappropriately  committed  to  psychiatric  hospitals.  Ninety  mentally  retarded \npersons  identified  by  TOMHMR  staff  in  May  1981  as  inappropriate  for \nhospitalization  at  state  mental  hospitals  still  remain  in  these  facilities. \nAdditional  mentally  retarded  persons  have  been  improperly  and  perhaps \nillegally  committed  to  State  mental  hospitals  since  the  entry  of  the \nSettlement  Agreement.  These  persons  are  not  mentally  ill  and/or  co  not \nrequire  hospitalization.  One  hundred  sixty-seven  (167)  menially  retarded \npersons  improperly  remain  in  mental  hospitals,  and  as  of  March  1983  had \nnot  received  their  required  evaluations,  placements  or  discharges. \nPursuant  to  the  requirements  of  Sections  VI(D)(7—9)  of  the  Agreement, \nnone  of  these  persons  should  now  remain  in  state  hospitals.  (Tr.,  pp.  45— \nAG.) \nNotwithstanding  compliance  by  TODMHMR  with  Section  Vi(D)(10)  of  the \nSettlement  Agreement  (notifying  State  court  judges  to  cease  the  practice  of \nimproper  commitment  of  mentally  retarded  persons  to  state  hospitals), \nimproper  commitments  by  these  judges  continue.  During  the  last  six \nmonths  sixty-five  inappropriately  committed  persons  were  removed  from \nstate  hospitals;  at  the  same  time  another  sixty-five  inappropriately\ncommitted  persons  took  their  places.  Similarly,  “)378  based  upon  a  survey \nby  TDMHMR  personnel,  14  of  22  mentally  retarded  persons  committed  to \nTerrell  State  Hospital  in  October  1983  were  inappropriately  committed \nbecause  they  were  not  mentally  ill. \nBecause  State  court  judges  are  unable  to  commit  mentally  retarded \npersons  to  State  schools  unless  bed  space  is  available,  mentally  retarded \npersons  continue  to  be  improperly  committed  to  State  hospitals, \nnotwithstanding  purported  statutory  safeguards  which  are  intended  to \nprevent  improper  commitments.  The  Mental  Health  Division  must  initially \naccept  persons  so  committed  as  there  is  no  “space  available’  statutory \nlimitation  preventing  these  persons  from  being  committed  to  mental \nhospitals.  Moreover,  a  mental  health  commitment  is  presumptively  valid  on \nits  face;  therefore,  the  Division  is  required  to  accept  the  committed  person \neven  if  it  is  obvious  that  the  individual  is  not  mentally  il.  Pursuant  to  the \nAgreement,  once  the  individual  is  identified  as  inappropriate  for  mental \nhospital  care,  TDMHMR  is  required  to  place  or  discharge  the  improperly \ncommitted  individual.  (Tr.,  pp.  54,  184,  204-06.) \nAlthough  the  continuing  actions  of  State  court  judges  continue  to  frustrate \nimplementation  of  the  Settlement,  the  ultimate  responsibility  for  relieving \nthe  problem  of  ever-increasing  improperly  committed  persons  rests  with \nDefendants. \nThe  deadlines  established  in  the  Agreement  for  implementation  of  Section \nVi(D)  have  not  been  met,  but  the  parties  have  continued  their  efforts  to \nestablish  modified  time  tables.  At  the  August  1983  meeting,  attended  by  all \nparties  and  the  Court,  the  Defendants  presented  their  proposed \nimplementation  plan  and  policy  statement.  The  proposal  provided  that  joint \ndischarge  planning  meetings  for  all  unsuitably  hospitalized  mentally \nretarded  persons  were  to  be  completed  by  January  71,  1984,  with \nappropriate  placements  occurring  within  45  days  of  said  meetings.  in  mid- \nDecember,  however,  the  Panel  learned  that  these  deadlines  had  also  not \nbeen  met.  (Plaintiffs’  Exhibits  9  and  10).  Defendants  apparentiy  were \nengaged  in  further  re-drafting  of  the  policy,  but  had  failed  to  inform  the \nPanel  of  the  proposed  changes.  (Tr.,  p.  32.)  As  a  result,  the  Panel \nconcluded  that  Defendants  were  not  in  compliance  with  the  applicable \nportions  of  the  Agreement.  Defendants  testified  that  the  final  version  of \ntheir  policy  would  be  disseminated  by  February  22,  1984.  (Tr.,  p.  198.} \nAttached  to  Defendants’  proposed  Findings  of  Fact  and  Conclusions  of \nLaw,  filed  March  2,  1984,  is  a  document  dated  February  23,  1984,  entitled \n“Administrative  Policy,  Procedures  for  Discharge  of  Persons  with  Mental \nRetardation  from  State  Mental  Hospitals”.  Assuming  the  Panel  has\nreceived  a  copy  of  this  document  and  agrees  with  its  substantive \nprovisions,  Defendants  have  now  corrected  their  noncompliance  with  the \nrequirements  of  Section  VI(D)  of  the  Agreement. \nThe  Court  expects  that,  from  this  date  forward,  Defendants  will \ncommunicate  any  further  problems  in  the  implementation  of  Section  VI(D) \nto  the  Panel  as  such  probiems  occur. \nRemedy \nHaving  found  that  Defendants  are  not  complying  with  several  portions  of \nthe  Agreement,  the  Court  must  determine  an  appropriate  remedy.  The \nCourt  reserves  this  determination  pending  the  receipt  of  recommendations \nfrom  the  Plaintiffs,  Defendant  TODMHMR,  the  United  States,  and  the  Panel. \nWithout  limiting  or  foreclosing  any  appropriate  suggestions  which  the \nparties  may  advance,  the  Court  notes  the  following  options  available  to  it: \n1.

TAYLOR,  Jr.,  Chief  Judge. \nThe  plight  of  the  mentally  disabled  is  among  the  saddest  and  most \nalarming  problems  facing  our  society,  and  too  little  is  done  to  alleviate  the \neffects  of  the  problem.  Traditionally  we  have  relegated  persons  suffering \nfrom  mental  disabilities  to  deplorabie  institutions  that  have  been \ninadequately  staffed,  improperly  managed,  and  have  little  regard  for  the \nconstitutional  “s¢s  rights  of  those  in  the  institution.  The  mentally  disabled \nhave  been  the  victims  of  widespread  governmental  complacency  and \noutright  neglect.  This  is  outrageous.  But,  worst  of  all,  most  of  us  have \naccepted  it  without  protest.'  \nThe  Court  is  well  aware  of  the  popular  belief  of  the  deficiencies  in  the\nmental  health  systems  of  the  various  states.  The  Court  firmly  believes  that \neach  and  every  patient  of  a  mental  institution,  whether  voluntarily  or \ninvoluntarily  committed,  has  constitutional  rights  which  will  be  jealously \nguarded  by  the  State  and  Federal  Courts  of  this  land. \nBut  constitutional  rights  are  minimal  rights.  They  are  the  floor  upon  which \nwe  have  built  our  system  of  freedom  and  liberty  under  the  rule  of  law. \nWhen  an  individual  has  a  grievance  against  his  government,  State  or \nFederal,  the  initial  inquiry  must  be  to  whom  must  the  grievance  be \naddressed?  lf  the  grievance  concerns  a  fundamental  attack  on  a  liberty \nprotected  by  the  United  States  Constitution  or  a  State  constitution  the \nproper  forum  usually  is  a  court  of  law.  If  it  is  not,  the  proper  forum  may  be \nthe  executive  or  legislative  branch. \nThe  controversy  now  before  the  Court,  an  application  for  preliminary \ninjunction,  is  of  a  new,  unexplored  type.  There  are  few  cases  defining  the \nrights  of  patients  in  mental  institutions.  The  question  that  the  Court  has  in \nmind  is  what  grievances  of  these  Plaintiffs  should  be  acdressed  to  a  court \nand  which  should  be  addressed  to  the  Legislature  of  the  State  of  Texas? \nThe  Court  is  cognizant  of  the  generally  held  belief  that  too  little  is  being \ndone  for  mental  health  patients.  And  the  consensus  of  both  Plaintiffs  and \nDefendants  is  that  the  Terrell  State  Hospital  is  understaffed  and  there  is  not \nsufficient  money  available  for  care  and  treatment  of  patients.  But  at  what \npoint  do  deficiencies  in  treatment  or  care  became  of  constitutional \nsignificance. \nThe  Fifth  Circuit  has  held  that  involuntarily  committed  patients  have  a  right \nto  treatment.2  Again  the  Court  is  faced  with  questions  as  to  what  is \ntreatment  and  what  constitutes  constitutionally  required  minimum  treatment \nof  involuntarily  committed  patients? \nainilisipatients  herein,  though,  were  voluntarily  committed.  Under \nVernan’s  Ann. Civ Stat.  art.  5547-25, they  may  be  released  within  96  hours \nof  written  request  unless  a  netition  or  application  for  involuntary \ncommitment is  filed  and  they  are  held  pursuant  to  it.  This  raises  on  the  face \nof  the  matter  a  question  as  to  whether  there  is  a  case  or  controversy  before \nthe  Court.3 \nThe  Court  also  has  problems  with  what  sort  of  relief  it  could  or  should  give \nin  this  case  if  it  concluded  relief  was  appropriate.  Normally  in  cases  such  as \nvoting  rights  cases  and  desegregation  cases,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  state \nofficials  involved  to  come  up  with  a  course  of  action  that  will  rectify  any \nconstitutional  infirmities.  The  Court  is  also  cognizant  of  the  prisoner  relief \ncases  in  which  the  ultimate  remedy  is  release  of  the  prisoner  if  the  public \nofficials  do  not  rectify  the  constitutional  wrong.  In  any  event,  the  public\nofficials  are  usually  allowed  to  shape  a  remedy  as  they  undoubtedly  best \nknow  the  operations  of  their  systems. \n1 \nThis  raises  another  problem.  Plaintiffs  have  not  met  their  burden  of  “#3 \nproof.  The  Fifth  Circuit  has  recently  set  down  the  prerequisites  to  the \ngranting  of  a  preliminary  injunction.  They  are: \n(1)  a  substantial  likelihood  that  plaintiff  will  prevail  on  the  merits,  (2) a \nsudstantial  threat  that  plaintiff  will  suffer  irreparable  injury  if  the  injunction  is \nnot  granted,  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury  to  plaintiff  outweighs  the \nthreatened  harm  the  injunction  may  do  to  defendant,  and  (4)  that  granting \nthe  preliminary  injunction  will  not  disserve  the  public  interest. \n2 \nThe  Court  cannot  in  any  way  say  that  Plaintiffs  will  or  will  not  succeed  on \nthe  merits.  There  is  a  dearth  of  law  on  the  subject.  Plaintiffs’  main  attack  in \nthis  case  has  been  upon  the  use  of  seclusion  rooms.  Seclusion  rooms  are \nactually  enclosures  for  solitary  confinement.  They  are  ordinarily  brought \ninto  use  for  the  protection  of  the  patient  or  for  the  protection  of  the  other \ninmates  of  the  institution.  In  the  case  of  Mr.  Jenkins,  it  appears  that  he  was \nput  into  seclusion  because  of  his  frequent  violent  behavior.  Many  times  he \nstarted  fights  with  other  patients.  His  safety  and  the  safety  of  his  fellow \npatients  is,  of  course,  of  great  concern  to  the  Court.  All  of  the  experts  who \ntestified  agreed  that  the  use  of  seclusion  rooms  should  not  be  absolutely \nprohibited  but  these  experts  disagree  as  to  the  time  of  confinement  ina \nseclusion  room  without  attention  and  treatment  of  the  patient  as  well  as  an \nopportunity  for  his  exercise.  Neither  side  has  presented  a  full  factual \nexplanation  as  to  the  workings  of  the  Terrell  State  Hospital  although  copies \nof  procedures  promulgated  by  the  Hospital  for  the  use  of  seclusion  rooms \nwere  admitied  in  evidence.  These  procedures  do  not  facially  show  a \nconstitutional  abuse.  There  was  some  evidence  of  abuse  of  seclusion \nrooms  presented  at  the  hearing  but  it  related  to  incidents  that  occurred  in \nthe  past.  Other  evidence  was  presented  that  the  named  Plaintiffs  had  been \nput  into  seclusion  many  times.  This  does  show  a  potential  for  the  abuse  of \nseciusion  rooms  but  the  Court  is  not  convinced  that  there  is  at  the  present \ntime  an  actual  abuse.  It  could  well  be  a  deprivation  of  the  constitutional \nrights  of  a  patient  for  him  to  be  incarcerated  in  one  of  these  solitary \nconfinement  rooms  and  then  caused  to  remain  there  over  an  extended \nperiod  of  time  without  attention  or  treatment. \nThe  Court  would  be  loathe  to  interfere  with  the  operation  of  Terrell  State \nHospital  in  the  absence  of  a  full  and  complete  showing  that  would  provide \nanswers  to  the  questions  raised  in  this  Opinion.s  It  is  anticipated  that  upon\ntrial  on  the  merits  such  showing  will  be  made  but  until  such  time  no \ninjunctive  order  will  issue. \nDue  to  the  views  expressed  herein  and  the  nature  of  the  case,  it  will  be \nexpedited  upon  the  docket  of  the  Court.  A  hearing  on  the  class  action \naspect  is  set  for  October  10,  1974,  at  2:00  P.M.,  and  the  trial  on  the  merits \nis  set  for  November  18,  1974,  at  9:30  A.M.\n",

The  Monitor  further  represents  that  Ed \nSection  III.C.2.b.  had  previously  been  recommended  for \ndischarge  from  the  jurisdiction of  the  Court. \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:74-cv-00394-H   Document 3   Filed 07/08/96    Page 2 of 2   PageID 131\nCloutman  III,  attorney  for  the  Plaintiffs,  concurs  with  the \nMonitor's  recommendation. \nSections  III.C.2.  a.  through  d.  include  the  requirement \nto  discharge  patients  within  180  days  of  the  time  of  their \nrecommended  court  discharge  and  other  requirements  aimed  at \nimproving  the  adequacy  of  care  and  treatment.  The  Monitor  is \nsatisfied  that  the  backlog  of  patients  on  the  180-day  list have \nbeen  discharged  appropriately  and  that  the  Defendants  have \ndemonstrated  the  capacity  to  maintain  placements.  In  addition, \ntraining  on  the  full  treatment  principles  has  taken  place  in  the \nstate  schools.  And,  the  requirements  concerning  the  monitoring \nof  placements  of MDU  clients  in  the  community  have  also  been  met. \nThe  Court  accepts  and  adopts  the  R.A.J.  Monitor's \nReport  and  Recommendation  #29.  Accordingly,  all  of  the  issues \ncovered  under  Section  III.C.2.  of  the  Settlement Agreement  are \ndischarged  from  the  jurisdiction of  the  Court. \nSO  ORDERED. \n/7, \nDATED:  May  1996. \n2 ",
