On June 27, 2016, the parties jointly moved for a 60-day stay so that they can explore an informal resolution of this case. The decision to stay a case is entrusted to the Court's discretion, and given the lengthy trial practice schedule that the parties will enjoy in this case, the Court is not of the view that a stay is necessary to allow the parties to explore an early resolution. The motion for a stay (Doc. 27 ) is DENIED. The parties remain free to pursue an early resolution and the defendants remain free to move for extensions of time to file their answers during that process -- those extension motions will be resolved by Magistrate Judge Frazier. In filing motions for extensions, the parties should remain mindful of the scheduled trial date and the deadlines that will accompany that date. Signed by Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan on 6/29/2016.

The plaintiffs sued ACHA under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and state law, seeking injunctive relief and damages. Represented by the Sargent Shriver National Center of Poverty Law and private counsel, the plaintiffs claimed that ACHA has persisted in racially discriminatory practices for the past 40 years, pointing to a previously settled lawsuit in which the Department of Justice found a pattern and practice of racially segregated housing. The plaintiffs also alleged that ACHA had ignored multiple requests to adequately maintain the housing units. </p><p>After filing three additional amended complaints, which included adding and removing individual plaintiffs and dropping the putative class-action claims for damages, as well as engaging in some discovery, the parties started participating in settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly. On July 27, 2017, the majority of the plaintiffs stipulated with the defendants to dismiss the case with prejudice and without costs. Three remaining plaintiffs failed to respond to the court on whether they intended to proceed with the case. On September 12, 2017, Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan dismissed and closed the case after the three remaining plaintiffs failed to further prosecute the case. </p>",

This lawsuit is brought on behalf of Paul Lambert, Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, \nPamela Purdiman, Shameka Nelson, Kimberly Simelton, Chena Brazil, Kimberly McAllister, \nKelsey Lowe, Angela Mitchell, LaTonya Lee, DeShawna Washam, Carlos Trenton, Charmaine \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 2 of 27   Page ID #368\nLambert, Aaron Hall, Coretta Cornelius, Tanisha Johnson, Audrey Tabor, Beverly Davis, Myra \nRayford, Shenunith Ellis, Leneca Baldwin, Shawnya Williams, Chauncey Davis, Lillie Jones, \nTiarra Bedford, Jeanette Davis, Deniesha Childress, Jacqueline Vaughn, Danielle Lowe, Elisha \nLee, Charlotte Viel, Theras Heard, and Monica Woodson, who are current and former residents \nof the Alexander County Housing Authority (“ACHA”) to remedy rampant race discrimination \nand family status discrimination. For years, ACHA and its agents have discriminated against \nresidents of its McBride and Elmwood family housing developments based on their race and \nfamilial status, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604, Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003.  \n2.  ACHA has engaged in a pattern and practice of segregating its public housing \ndevelopments by race, even though the United States Department of Justice previously found \nthat it engaged in the same conduct more than 40 years ago.   \n3.  ACHA also has engaged in a pattern and practice of not maintaining the Elmwood \nand McBride developments – which are occupied almost exclusively by African-American \ntenants such as the Plaintiffs – so that they have deteriorated to the point that they are nearly \nuninhabitable. McBride and Elmwood apartments, which are located in Cairo, Illinois, are \ninfested with mice, roaches, and bedbugs. For years, Elmwood and McBride residents made \nrequest for repairs, and ACHA ignored them or repaired them in a substandard manner. Both \ndevelopments also have long suffered from serious security problems. Despite these safety \nissues, ACHA failed to provide security guards or cameras. \n4.  Meanwhile, ACHA has adequately maintained its Connell Smith development in \nsatisfactory condition and provided both security cameras and security guards. Until very \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 3 of 27   Page ID #369\nrecently, approximately half of Connell Smith residents were white, and almost all were over the \nage of fifty.  \n5.  ACHA has refused to place families with children in certain public housing \ndevelopments, such as Connell Smith, in order to prevent African American families from living \nin majority white public housing developments. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \n(federal question), 1343 (color of state law), 3613 (Fair Housing Act), and 1367 (supplemental \njurisdiction).  \n7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the ACHA, pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n8.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \nACHA violated federal law in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n9.  Paul Lambert is an African-American man who has lived in ACHA’s Elmwood \ndevelopment since approximately 1978. He lives in a three-bedroom unit with his wife, and adult \ndisabled son. The family has experienced terrible housing conditions, including bedbugs and \nmice.  The heat is frequently out, forcing the family to heat their home with their oven.  \n10.  Mary Holder is an African-American woman who has lived in ACHA’s McBride \ndevelopment since approximately 1992. She lives alone in a two-bedroom unit. She has \nexperienced terrible housing conditions, including bedbugs and mice, a cracked porch, doors that \ndo not close fully, and problems with her heat. A pipe under the kitchen sink frequently falls off \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 4 of 27   Page ID #370\nand floods the kitchen. The bathroom sink has separated from the wall. Rather than replace the \nsink, ACHA employees used several tubes of caulk to adhere it to the wall.   \n11.  Barbara Holder is an African-American woman who has lived in ACHA’s \nMcBride development since approximately 1970. She lives alone in a three-bedroom unit. She \nhas experienced terrible housing conditions, including bedbugs and mice, a hole under the sink in \nthe kitchen, and insufficient heat. A bedroom door is off the hinges.

Shameka Nelson is an African-American woman who lives with her seven \nchildren, ages one to twelve, in a six-bedroom unit in ACHA’s McBride development. The \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 5 of 27   Page ID #371\nfamily has experienced terrible housing conditions, including roaches, mice, peeling paint, mold, \nand bedbugs.

She has lived at McBride \nfor approximately seven years. The family has experienced terrible housing conditions, including \nroaches, mice, spiders, and mold. Even though mice come through the drain in the bathtub \nACHA has only provided the family with glue traps. The children cannot take baths in the tub. \nThe family’s heat only works on the second floor, forcing them to heat the first floor of their \nhome with their oven. The children have been diagnosed with asthma, which has been attributed \nto the family’s housing conditions.  \n17.  Denieshia Childress is an African-American woman who lives with her four \nchildren, ages nine months, one, five, and eight, in ACHA’s McBride development. She has \nlived at McBride for approximately three years. Ms. Childress’ unit is infested with roaches, bed \nbugs and mice.  There are serious plumbing issues, resulting in frequently clogged toilets and \nsinks. The plumbing problems have also caused mold in the bathroom and one of her children’s \nrooms. The kitchen ceiling is falling down. Electrical outlets either do not work or the fuse will \nblow when they are used. Ms. Childress’ son has asthma, which is exacerbated by the housing \nconditions, resulting in him being frequently sick.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 6 of 27   Page ID #372\n18.

Angela Mitchell is an African-American woman who lives with her child, age \nsixteen, in ACHA’s Elmwood development. She has lived at Elmwood for approximately \nseventeen years. At one point, Ms. Mitchell’s unit was so infested with mice her daughter could \nnot sleep in her own bed. When Ms. Mitchell’s heat went out, ACHA instructed her to use her \noven for heat. Ms. Mitchell became ill as a result. When Ms. Mitchell’s refrigerator stopped \nworking, ACHA provided her with a replacement refrigerator that was full of roaches. Ms. \nMitchell’s unit also has serious problems with rats. \n20.  LaTonya Lee is an African-American woman who lives with her two children, \nages three and four, in ACHA’s Elmwood development. She has lived at Elmwood for \napproximately four years. Ms. Lee’s unit is infested with roaches, bed bugs, and rats. The unit is \ncovered in mold and peeling paint. ACHA has only offered Tilex to treat the mold. The fuse \nblows out when the family uses the electrical outlets. The heat only works on the second floor of \nthe home. Both children have asthma, which is attributed by the unit’s conditions.  \n21.  Deshawna Washam is an African-American woman who lives with two of her \nchildren, ages sixteen and nine, in ACHA’s Elmwood development. She has lived at Elmwood \nfor approximately nineteen years in four different units. While living at Elmwood, Ms. Washam \nhas dealt with serious mold and rat infestation issues.

Carlos Trenton is an African-American man who lives by himself in ACHA’s \nMcBride development. He was born and raised at McBride but received his own unit \napproximately five years ago. Mr. Trenton’s unit is infested with roaches and bedbugs. For two \nyears, his heat did not work, so he had to heat his unit with his stove. The doorframe is broken to \nhis front door. There is mold in his bathroom, and the ceiling lights leak water when it rains. The \nlocks on the windows are broken, and his bathtub leaks because of missing grout and caulk. \nSewer water often backs up into his bathtub. \n23.  Charmaine Lambert is an African-American woman who, until very recently, \nlived by herself in ACHA’s Elmwood development. She lived with her family at Elmwood as a \nchild and then moved into her own unit at Elmwood approximately six years ago. Her unit was \ninfested with bedbugs, mice, and rats. The kitchen cabinets were not secured to the wall and \nthere was mold throughout her bathroom. \n24.  Aaron Hall is an African-American man who lives by himself in ACHA’s \nElmwood development.

She has lived at \nElmwood for approximately eight years. Ms. Johnson has experienced terrible housing \nconditions, including roaches, bedbugs, rats, and mold.

Mold covers her tub and closets \nand the use of her electrical outlets often result in a blown fuse. Her unit has serious water \ndamage, which has caused peeling paint and constantly wet bathroom floors. \n36.  Danielle Lowe is an African-American woman who lives with her two children, \nages one and two, at ACHA’s McBride development. She has lived at McBride and Elmwood \nfor most of her life, and she has lived in her most recent unit since 2014. Ms. Lowe’s unit is \ninfested with roaches and mice. There are holes and mold in her bathroom and the bathtub used \nto leak continuously. The windows and doors to her unit are not sealed properly, causing heat to \nleak out. When she turns on the outside porch lights, she often gets an electrical shock when she \ntouches the kitchen sink. The housing conditions have caused her children to have breathing \nproblems.  \n37.  Theras Heard is an African-American man who has lived at ACHA’s McBride \ndevelopment since 2013. Mr. Heard’s unit is infested with roaches and bedbugs.  The refrigerator \nissued to him by ACHA at one point had maggots. After ACHA refused to get rid of the rats and \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 11 of 27   Page ID #377\nmice in his unit, Mr. Heard took steps to fill the holes in his unit where the rodents were gaining \nentry. The kitchen sink is leaking, causing mold and mildew.  Due to the terrible housing \nconditions, Mr. Heard sent his daughter to live with her mother. The housing conditions have \nalso exacerbated Mr. Heard’s sickle cell disease and caused breathing problems. \n38.  Jacqueline Vaughn is an African-American woman who has lived on and off with \nher two children, ages six and two, at ACHA’s Elmwood’s development since 2001. Ms. \nVaughn’s unit is infested with roaches, rate, and mold. Her heat does not work, forcing her to \nheat her home with her oven. She is frequently shocked by the electrical outlets. As a result of \nthe housing conditions, the family suffers from asthma and sinus problems.   \n39.  Charlotte Viel is an African-American woman who has lived by herself at \nACHA’s McBride development since 2009. Her unit is infested with roaches, rats, and mold. Her \nheat and electrical outlets do not work. There is water damage throughout the walls. As a result \nof her housing conditions, Ms. Viel has experienced sinus problems and headaches. \n40.  Tiarra Bedford is an African-American woman who has lived at ACHA’s \nElmwood development with her two children, ages nine and five, since 2011. Ms. Bedford’s unit \nhas water bugs and mice. The thermostat does not work, causing the unit to become too hot. The \nshower leaks into the downstairs kitchen cabinets, causing mold and mildew.  \n41.  Chauncey Davis is an African-American woman who has lived at ACHA’s \nMcBride development with her three children, ages eleven and two, since 2003. Her unit is \ninfested with roaches and mice. The heat does not work in one room of her house. There is black \nmold in her bathroom and some of the electrical outlets do not work. Her bathtub leaks into the \nfirst floor. The kitchen cabinets are falling off the wall and the paint is peeling. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 12 of 27   Page ID #378\n42.  Shawyna Williams is an African-American woman who has lived on and off at \nACHA’s Elmwood development with her five children, ages nineteen, seventeen, fifteen, \nfourteen, and seven, since 2000. Her unit is infested is with mold, roaches, bedbugs, and mice. \nThe heat does not work and the playground is too torn up for the children to play there. The front \ndoor frame is coming off the wall and the gutters are falling off the unit’s exterior. The bathtub \nbacks up when the family tries to take a bath.  Two of her children developed asthma as a result \nof the terrible housing conditions.   \n43.  Defendant Alexander County Housing Authority is an Illinois municipal \ncorporation, created and existing under the Illinois Housing Authorities Act, 310 Ill. Comp. Stat. \n10/1 et seq. ACHA is a public housing agency within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1437. ACHA \nis a recipient of federal financial assistance and is considered to be a program or activity with \noperations subject to Title VI. 24 C.F.R. § 1.2(f). ACHA operates 478 public housing units \nwithin Alexander County.  \n44.  Defendant James Wilson was ACHA’s Executive Director from 1989 to 2013. He \ncontinued working for ACHA on a part-time consultant basis from 2013 to 2015. He returned to \nthe Executive Director position for an 11-day period in early 2015. \n45.  Defendant Martha Franklin worked as ACHA’s Executive Director from April \n2013 to January 2015. She worked as ACHA’s Finance Director for part of 2015. \n46.  In February 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) took over the operations of ACHA pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 907. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nHISTORY OF RACE DISCRIMINATON AT ACHA \n \n47.  ACHA has had a long history of discriminating against African-American \nresidents based on their race. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 13 of 27   Page ID #379\n48.  In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against ACHA for \nintentionally segregating its two main public housing complexes by race. At the time, Elmwood \nwas reserved for white residents, and Pyramid Courts (now McBride) was reserved for African-\nAmerican residents. \n49.  The lawsuit was eventually settled, and ACHA agreed to stop segregating its \nhousing based on race. ACHA agreed to prioritize occupancy such that Pyramid Courts would \nhave 71 white residents (out of 237), and Elmwood would have 39 African-American tenants \n(out of 159). \nDefendants Have Segregated Residents on the Basis of Race \nAnd Perpetuated Racial Segregation \n \n50.  Today, ACHA has returned to its discriminatory past by engaging in a pattern and \npractice of segregating residents on the basis of race. Approximately 97% of the residents living \nin McBride and Elmwood are African-American, while white households predominate in the \ndevelopments of Meadows, Johnson, Sunset Terrace, King, and Connell Smith. This is true even \nthough African-Americans make up just 36% of the residents within Alexander County, \nACHA’s service area.  \nDefendants Fail to Maintain McBride and Elmwood, \nForcing The Residents To Live In Squalor \n \n51.  ACHA, through its Board and Executive Directors, have engaged in a pattern and \npractice of allowing the McBride and Elmwood developments to deteriorate, while preserving \nand maintaining the Connell Smith and Thebes developments in satisfactory condition. \nDefendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of allowing the housing conditions at \nMcBride and Elmwood to deteriorate because of the residents’ race, African-American.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 14 of 27   Page ID #380\n52.  For several years, units located at McBride and Elmwood – including those \noccupied by Plaintiffs – have been infested with roaches, mice, and bedbugs. Despite residents’ \ncomplaints, ACHA has done little to nothing to address the problem.  \n53.  Many of the units at McBride and Elmwood have mold as well as plumbing, \nheating, and electrical deficiencies. Defendants have been aware of these problems for years, yet \nthey have failed to meaningfully address them.  \n54.  There is significant gun violence and other crime at McBride and Elmwood, yet \nACHA has done very little to increase security at these developments. At the same time, ACHA \nhas devoted security resources to Connell Smith and Shoemaker, where there is far less crime \nand no gun violence. \n55.  While ACHA was under the control of Defendants Wilson and Franklin, ACHA \nwasted resources on excessive employee retirement bonuses, unnecessary post retirement \ncontracts, and unjustified travel expenses. These unjustified expenses are chronicled in an \nAugust 23, 2015 article entitled, “Chaos in Cairo” published by the newspaper, The Southern \nIllinoisan. \n56.  In part because of these unjustified payouts to current and former employees, \nACHA has been unable to address the serious pest and rodent infestations or other conditions \nproblems at McBride and Elmwood. \n57.  Wilson and Franklin both worked as ACHA Executive Director during relevant \ntime periods. Neither of them took action to meaningfully alleviate the pest and rodent problems \nat McBride and Elmwood, nor did they take action to meaningfully alleviate the crime, mold, \nand plumbing problems. \nHUD Finds That ACHA Discriminated Against Residents Based On Race \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 15 of 27   Page ID #381\n58.  On September 30, 2014, HUD issued a letter to ACHA finding that it had violated \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VI”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. See Exhibit A (HUD letter to \nACHA). HUD determined that ACHA violated Title VI by engaging in intentional racial \nsegregation in McBride and Elmwood. Id. \n59.  HUD also found that ACHA was well aware of the security and conditions issues \nat McBride and Elmwood, but failed to provide adequate maintenance and security resources to \neither development.  \n60.  HUD concluded that ACHA’s segregation of the developments by race and its \ncorresponding failure to maintain McBride and Elmwood resulted in an adverse impact on \nAfrican-American families and residents. \n61.  Despite these findings, ACHA, Wilson, and Franklin continued their pattern and \npractice of segregating families based on race and familial status and continued to allow the \nconditions at McBride and Elmwood to deteriorate because of the residents’ race. \nACHA’s Enforces A Rule That Discriminates Against Families With Children \n62.  All of ACHA’s 478 units are designated as family public housing. \n63.  However, for at least the past ten years, ACHA, through its Board and Executive \nDirectors, have implemented a rule prohibiting families with children from living in Connell \nSmith, Shoemaker, and several of the scattered site developments and improperly reserved them \nfor seniors and people with disabilities.  \n64.  Neither Connell Smith nor Shoemaker nor the scattered-site programs satisfy the \nFair Housing Act’s definition of “housing for older persons” as defined at 42 U.S.C. § \n3607(b)(2).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 16 of 27   Page ID #382\n65.  ACHA never sought to re-designate Connell Smith, Shoemaker, or the scatted site \nprograms under PIH Notice 2005-2 prior to implementing this rule barring families with minor \nchildren and designating certain buildings as senior/disabled housing.  \n66.  Wilson and Franklin worked as ACHA Executive Director during relevant time \nperiods. They both enforced the rule prohibiting families with children from living in Connell \nSmith, Shoemaker and the scattered site developments \nACHA Breaches Its Residential Lease \n67.  On information and belief, during each year that they lived in a ACHA unit, \nPlaintiffs signed a lease with ACHA that provided as follows: \nPHA Obligations [966.4(e):  The PHA shall be obligated: \n \na)  To maintain the dwelling unit and the project in decent, safe, and sanitary \ncondition. \n \nb)  To comply with the requirement of applicable building codes, housing \ncodes, and HUD regulations materially affecting health and safety;  \n \nc)  To make necessary repairs to the dwelling unit. \n \nAs well, pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 966.4(h), the lease:  \n \n… [sets] forth the rights and obligations of the tenant  \nand the PHA if the dwelling unit is damaged to the extent  \nthat conditions are created which are hazardous to life, health, \nor safety of the occupants and shall provide that: \n \n(1) The tenant shall immediately notify the project management \nof the damage; \n \n(2) The PHA shall be responsible for repair of the unit within a \nreasonable time: Provided, That if the damage was caused by the  \ntenant, tenant’s household or guests, the reasonable cost of the repairs \nshall be charged to the tenant; \n \n(3) The PHA shall offer standard alternative accommodations, if available \nwhere necessary repairs cannot be made within a reasonable time; and \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 17 of 27   Page ID #383\n(4) Provisions shall be made for abatement of rent in proportion to the \nseriousness of the damage and loss in value as a dwelling if repairs are \nnot made accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section or alternative \naccommodations not provided in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this \nsection, except that no abatement of rent shall occur if the tenants rejects  \nthe alternative accommodation or if the damage was caused by the tenant,  \ntenant’s household or guests.       \n \nSee Exhibit B (Copy of Sample Residential Lease Agreement).  \n \n68.  ACHA breached its leases with Plaintiffs by allowing their units to fall into such a \nstate of disrepair that the conditions are hazardous to the life, health, and safety of the occupants.  \nPlaintiffs repeatedly notified ACHA of their terrible housing conditions. ACHA did not repair or \naddress the conditions in a reasonable time and manner and did not offer standard alternative \naccommodations. ACHA also failed to abate the rent in proportion to the seriousness of the \nconditions and loss in value of the unit because the repairs were not made. \n69.  ACHA’s breach caused Plaintiffs to suffer out of pocket costs associated with \npaying the rent as well as substantial monetary injury. \n70.  Plaintiffs substantially performed their obligations under their residential leases \nwith ACHA. \n71.  In failing to maintain Plaintiffs’ units in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition, \nDefendants demonstrated a conscious disregard for Plaintiffs’ welfare. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURPOSES ONLY \n72.  Plaintiffs bring the claims described in Counts I - VI on behalf of themselves and \nall others similarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n73.  All Plaintiffs bring their claims described in Counts I - VI on behalf of a proposed \n“McBride Elmwood Race Discrimination Subclass” defined as, “All current and former \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 18 of 27   Page ID #384\nAfrican-American ACHA public housing residents who lived in McBride or Elmwood in the two \nyears prior to the filing of Plaintiffs’ original complaint.” \n74.  Plaintiffs Simelton, Brazil, Purdiman, Heard, Lowe, Vaughn, McAllister, Lee, \nMitchell, Cornelius, and Baldwin bring the claims described in Counts VII and VIII on behalf of \nthemselves and all others similarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure.  \n75.  Simelton, Brazil, Purdiman, Heard, Lowe, Vaughn, McAllister, Lee, Mitchell, \nCornelius, and Baldwin bring the claims described in Counts VII and VIII on behalf of a \nproposed “McBride Elmwood Familial Status Discrimination Subclass” defined as, “All \ncurrent and former ACHA public housing residents who lived in McBride or Elmwood with \nminor children in the two years prior to the filing of Plaintiffs’ original complaint.” \n76.  All Plaintiffs bring the claim described in Count IX on behalf of themselves and \nall others similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n77.  Plaintiffs bring the claim described in Count IX on behalf of a proposed \n“McBride Elmwood Residential Lease Subclass” defined as, “All current and former ACHA \npublic housing residents who lived in McBride or Elmwood in the two years prior to the filing of \nPlaintiffs’ original complaint.” \n78.  Numerosity. The classes are so numerous that joinder of all of their members is \nimpracticable. Upon information and belief, each subclass is comprised of hundreds of \nindividuals. The putative class members are unlikely to press their claims on an individual basis \nbecause as residents of public housing, all putative class members have limited incomes, and the \nvalue of their individual claims is modest. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 19 of 27   Page ID #385\n79.  Commonality and Predominance. There are questions of fact and law common \nto the class, including:  \na)  whether ACHA discriminated against residents in McBride and Elmwood based on \ntheir race by refusing to maintain those developments and by prohibiting them from living \nin Connell Smith and certain scattered site developments.  \n \nb)  whether ACHA discriminated against residents in McBride and Elmwood based on \ntheir familial status by refusing to allow families with children to live in Connell Smith and \nShoemaker and certain scattered site developments. \n \nc)  whether ACHA breached its public housing lease by not maintaining the units in a \ndecent, safe, and sanitary condition and by not complying with all HUD regulations \naffecting health and safety. \n \n80.  Typicality and Adequacy. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the classes as a whole. \nAll of the Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief arise from the same unlawful practices: \ndiscriminating against residents in McBride and Elmwood based on their race and familial status \nand allowing the residential units to deteriorate. Proposed class representatives and class counsel \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes as a whole. Plaintiffs do not have \nany interests antagonistic to those of other class members. By filing this action, Plaintiffs have \ndisplayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who are similarly \nsituated. Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel. \n81.  Superiority. A class action for injunctive relief is superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.  \n82.  Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. ACHA has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the Rule 23(b)(2) class as a whole, so that final injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. For years, ACHA has \ndiscriminated against the residents of McBride and Elmwood based on their race and familial \nstatus, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 20 of 27   Page ID #386\nINJURY TO THE PLAINTIFFS \n83.  Defendants’ actions threaten Plaintiffs with imminent and irreparable injury, \nincluding deteriorating housing, crime, discrimination, and segregation.  \n84.  Defendants’ actions have the purpose and effect of limiting housing opportunities \nfor racial minorities and families with children. \n85.  Defendants’ actions disproportionately deny housing opportunities in Alexander \nCounty to racial minorities and families with children. \n86.  According to the 2014 American Community Survey, Alexander County contains \nan estimated total of 7,821 people, of whom 59.7% are non-Hispanic white and 35.9% are \nAfrican-American. African-Americans in Alexander County are disproportionately poor. 53.8% \nof African-American households in Alexander County earn incomes below the federal poverty \nline, compared to 19.7% of non-Hispanic white households. In 2014, 85.7% of African-\nAmerican households in Alexander County were income eligible for federally assisted housing, \ncompared to 59.8% of non-Hispanic white households in Alexander County. While African-\nAmericans comprise 35.9% of Alexander County’s population, approximately 45.2% of \nAlexander County households who are eligible for federally assisted housing are African-\nAmerican. \n87.  According to the 2014 American Community Survey, Alexander County contains \n2,826 households, of which 25.7% include children under the age of 18. Families with children \nunder the age of 18 in Alexander County are disproportionately poor. 60.3% of such households \nearn incomes below the federal poverty line, compared to 30.3% of households overall. In 2014, \n80.3% of Alexander County households with children under the age of 18 were income eligible \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 66   Filed 02/13/17   Page 21 of 27   Page ID #387\nfor federally assisted housing, compared with 46.1% of Alexander County households with no \nchildren under the age of 18 in the household.  \n88.  African-Americans also disproportionately reside in ACHA’s public housing. \nAlmost 80% of ACHA’s units contain a head of household who is African-American. \n89.   Through their actions described above, Defendants have acted negligently, \nintentionally, maliciously, and with willful, malicious, wanton, and reckless disregard for federal \nand state fair housing and non-discrimination laws. \n90.  Through their actions of allowing units at McBride and Elmwood to fall into a \nstate of disrepair as further described above, Defendants have acted negligently, intentionally, \nmaliciously, and with willful, malicious, wanton, and reckless disregard for the rights of the \nPlaintiffs. \n91.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to create a severe hardship for \nPlaintiffs. \n92.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \nLEGAL CLAIMS \n \nCOUNT I – FAIR HOUSING ACT CLAIM \nDISPARATE TREATMENT BASED ON RACE \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n93.

Alexander Cty. Hous. Auth., No. 3:16 CV 513 MJR/RJD, 2017 BL 97373 (S.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2017), Court Opinion\nReona J. Daly, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.\nReona J. Daly\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nDALY, Magistrate Judge:\nThis matter comes before the Court pursuant to the discovery dispute conference held on February 17, 2017. (Doc.\n67.) On May 10, 2016, Plaintiffs, who are residents of the McBride and Elmwood developments in Cairo, Illinois, filed a\ncomplaint against Defendants Alexander County Housing Authority, James Wilson, and Martha Franklin. (Doc. 1.) On\nFebruary 13, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging claims of housing discrimination based on race and\nfamilial status, breach of contract, and failure to maintain rental units. (Doc. 66.) On February 17, 2017, the Court held\na discovery dispute conference regarding Defendants' responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests. Following the\ndiscovery dispute conference, the sole remaining issue was whether Defendants could assert deliberative process\nprivilege to withhold the executive session minutes requested by Plaintiffs, and the parties submitted briefs on the\nissue. (Docs. 71, 72.)\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants waived deliberative process privilege by failing to assert it in a timely manner. Parties\nmust respond or object to requests for production within thirty days of service. Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b) . To assert\nprivilege with respect to discovery requests, a party must describe the withheld discovery materials in a manner that\nwill allow other parties to assess the assertion of privilege. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5) . Failure to comply with these\nprovisions may result in the waiver of privilege. Ritacca v. Abbott Labs., 203 F.R.D. 332 , 335 (N.D. Ill. 2001). As\nstated by the Ritacca court:\nAcknowledging the harshness of a waiver sanction, courts have reserved the sanction for those cases\nwhere the offending party committed unjustified delay in responding to discovery. Minor procedural\nviolations, good faith attempts at compliance, and other such mitigating circumstances militate against\nfinding waiver. In contrast, evidence of foot-dragging or a cavalier attitude towards following court orders\nand the discovery rules supports finding waiver. In the end, the determination of waiver must be made on\na case-by-case basis.\nId. \nAccording to Plaintiffs' submissions, Plaintiffs first issued a specific request for the executive session minutes on\nNovember 28, 2016. During a teleconference on January 12, 2017, Defendants did not expressly assert deliberative\nprocess privilege; however, Defendants questioned whether Plaintiffs were entitled to discover the executive session\nminutes, and Plaintiffs responded that they would follow up separately on the executive session minutes. On February\n17, 2017, during the discovery dispute conference, Defendants asserted deliberative process privilege for the first\ntime. Although Defendants should [*3] have asserted the deliberative process privilege sooner, Defendants' conduct\nfalls short of the conduct described in the cases cited by Plaintiffs, which consisted of misrepresentation, evasive\nbehavior, and a cavalier attitude with regard to the rules and orders. See Ritacca, 203 F.R.D. at 335-36 ; Slabaugh v.\nState Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126666 , [2013 BL 403608], 2013 WL 4777206 , at *2 (S.D. Ind.\nSept. 5, 2013). The Court concludes that Defendants' conduct does not warrant the harsh sanction of waiver.\nDefendants argue that the deliberative process privilege applies to the executive session minutes and that Plaintiffs\nhave failed to set forth a particularized need that outweighs the need for confidentiality. \"The deliberative process\nprivilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process of a governmental agency.\" United\nStates v. Farley, 11 F.3d 1385 , 1389 (7th Cir. 1993). \"The deliberative process privilege may be overcome where\nthere is a sufficient showing of a particularized need to outweigh the reasons for confidentiality.\" Id.Defendants have\nsubmitted the executive session minutes for in camera review. Upon review of the executive session minutes, the\n© 2017 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Terms of Service\n   // PAGE 2\n\nLambert v. Alexander Cty. Hous. Auth., No. 3:16 CV 513 MJR/RJD, 2017 BL 97373 (S.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2017), Court Opinion\nCourt finds that the executive session minutes reflect pre-decisional policy discussions. Plaintiffs argue that records of\nboard votes are not pre-decisional but are themselves decisions, which are not subject to the deliberative process\nprivilege. However, the executive session minutes contain no records of board votes.\nWith respect to a particularized need, Plaintiffs argue that the executive session minutes may provide evidence of\nintent to discriminate against residents on the basis of race or familial status and that the minutes are of heightened\nimportance due to the unavailability of other evidence. The Court finds the cases cited by Plaintiffs to be instructive on\nwhether Plaintiffs demonstrate a particularized need. See Gibbons v. Vill. of Sauk Vill., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167931\n, [2016 BL 404890], 2016 WL 7104255 (N.D. Ill. 2016)Sronkoski v. Schaumburg Sch. Dist., No. 54, 2009 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 57803 , [2009 BL 293305], 2009 WL 1940779 (N.D. Ill. 2009). In the employment discrimination cases of\nGibbons and Sronkoski, the plaintiff employees had knowledge prior to moving to compel that the defendant\nemployers had discussed the plaintiffs' employment at specific board meetings and requested records for those\nspecific board meetings. The courts in Gibbons and Sronkoski reviewed the records at issue and determined that the\nrecords were relevant to the plaintiffs' claims. The courts then concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a\nparticularized need and ordered the defendants to produce the records over their assertions of deliberative process\nprivilege.\nHere, Plaintiffs seek executive session minutes from 2012 to the present date without any effort to narrow the request\nto specific board meetings in which Defendants discussed topics relevant to Plaintiffs' claims. Rather, Plaintiffs broadly\nseek information regarding discussions on, inter alia, salaries, rental unit maintenance, and residential applications.\nPlaintiffs' scattershot approach stands in stark contrast to the particularized requests [*4] in Gibbons and Sronkoski.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a particularized need with respect to the executive\nsession minutes.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs' request to overrule Defendants' assertion of deliberative process privilege with\nrespect to Plaintiffs' request for Defendants' executive session minutes is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\nDATED: March 27, 2017\n/s/ Reona J.

On April \n14,  2017,  counsel  for  Plaintiffs  Latonya  Lee  and  Denieshia  Childress  moved  to \nwithdraw.  (Doc.  82).  According  to  the  motion,  counsel  for  Childress  attempted  to \ncontact  her  repeatedly  by  phone  and  by  letter,  and  she  did  not  respond  to  their \nattempts. Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly granted the motion to withdraw on April 17, \n2017. (Doc. 83). Counsel moved to withdraw from representing Coretta Cornelius on \nMay 9, 2017. (Doc. 90). The motion was granted on May 10, 2017. (Doc. 92). \n  During a June 15, 2017, telephone status conference, counsel for the represented \nplaintiffs and for the defendants indicated that they had reached a tentative settlement \nand that  the claims of the represented plaintiffs  were ready for a 60-day order of \ndismissal.  (Doc.  93).  Lee,  Childress,  and  Cornelius  did  not  appear  and  did  not \nparticipate in the settlement negotiations. After the hearing, Magistrate Judge Daly \nentered an order as to Lee, Childress, and Cornelius (Doc. 95) directing them to inform \nthe Court in writing by July 14, 2017, whether they intended to proceed with their \nclaims. They were warned that failure to comply with the Court’s order could result in \ndismissal of their claims for want of prosecution. The order was mailed to the three \nplaintiffs at their last known addresses. Denieshia Childress responded (Doc. 96) and \nindicated that she would like to proceed with her claims pro se, but Lee and Cornelius \ndid not respond. On August 1, 2017, the claims of Lee and Cornelius were dismissed for \nfailure to prosecute.  \n  Magistrate Judge Daly scheduled a telephone status conference for August 14, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 102   Filed 09/12/17   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #549\n2017, to discuss the status of Childress’s claims (Doc. 100). Childress was warned that \nfailure to participate in the status conference could lead to the dismissal of her claims \nfor lack of prosecution. The order was sent to Childress at her address of record, but she \nfailed to appear at the status conference. (See Doc. 101).  \n  Childress’s  failure  to  appear  and  to  participate  in  this  action  leads  the \nundersigned  to  conclude  that  she  has  failed  to  properly  prosecute  her  claims. \nAccordingly, the Court hereby DISMISSES the claims of Plaintiff Denieshia Childress \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).  \n  On July 27, 2017, the represented plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with \nprejudice  and  without  costs,  each  party  to  bear  its  own  attorneys’  fees.  (Doc.  97). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss a \ncase without a court order by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who \nhave appeared.  In this case, however, the stipulation was not signed by all parties who \nhad appeared at the time it was filed, and Rule 41(a)(2) requires an order by the Court \nto dismiss the claims. Having reviewed the record, the undersigned FINDS that the \nrequest  of  the  represented  Plaintiffs  to  dismiss  their  claims  with  prejudice  is \nappropriate.  The  claims  of  the  represented  Plaintiffs  are  hereby  DISMISSED  with \nprejudice and without costs, each party to bear its own attorneys’ fees. As no claims \nremain pending, the Clerk is DIRECTED to close this case.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.   \n  DATED: September 12, 2017           \n                s/ Michael J.

On June 27,\n2016, the parties jointly moved for a 60−day stay so that they can explore an informal\nresolution of this case. The decision to stay a case is entrusted to the Court's discretion,\nand given the lengthy trial practice schedule that the parties will enjoy in this case, the\nCourt is not of the view that a stay is necessary to allow the parties to explore an early\nresolution. The motion for a stay (Doc. 27 ) is DENIED. The parties remain free to\npursue an early resolution and the defendants remain free to move for extensions of\ntime to file their answers during that process −− those extension motions will be\nresolved by Magistrate Judge Frazier. In filing motions for extensions, the parties\nshould remain mindful of the scheduled trial date and the deadlines that will\naccompany that date. Signed by Chief Judge Michael J.

This lawsuit is brought on behalf of current and former residents of the Alexander \nCounty Housing Authority (“ACHA”) to remedy rampant race discrimination and family status \ndiscrimination as well as substantial rent overcharges. For years, ACHA and its agents have \ndiscriminated against residents of its McBride and Elmwood family housing developments based \non their race and familial status, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604, Title VI \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. ACHA also has \novercharged its residents for rent, in violation of the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a, in many instances collecting $100-$200 per month in excess of the limit \npermitted by federal law. \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 2 of 20   Page ID #2\n2.  ACHA has engaged in a pattern and practice of segregating its public housing \ndevelopments by race, even though the United States Department of Justice previously found \nthat it engaged in the same conduct more than 40 years ago.   \n3.  ACHA also has engaged in a pattern and practice of not maintaining the Elmwood \nand McBride developments – which are occupied almost exclusively by African-American \ntenants – so that they have deteriorated to the point that they are nearly uninhabitable. McBride \nand Elmwood apartments, which are located in Cairo, Illinois, are infested with mice, roaches, \nand bedbugs. For years, Elmwood and McBride residents made request for repairs, and ACHA \nignored them or repaired them in a substandard manner. Both developments also have long \nsuffered from serious security problems. Despite these safety issues, ACHA failed to provide \nsecurity guards or cameras.  \n4.  Meanwhile, ACHA has adequately maintained its Connell Smith development in \nsatisfactory condition and provided both security cameras and security guards. Until very \nrecently, approximately half of Connell Smith residents were white, and almost all were over the \nage of fifty.  \n5.  ACHA has refused to place families with children in certain public housing \ndevelopments, such as Connell Smith, in order to prevent African American families from living \nin majority white public housing developments. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \n(federal question), 1343 (color of state law), 3613 (Fair Housing Act), and 1367 (supplemental \njurisdiction).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 3 of 20   Page ID #3\n7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the ACHA, pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n8.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \nACHA violated federal law in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n9.  Paul Lambert is a 65-year-old African-American man who has lived in ACHA’s \nElmwood development since approximately 1978. He lives in a three-bedroom unit with his \nwife, Bessie, and 21-year-old disabled son, Sharonne. \n10.  Mary Holder is a 68-year-old African-American woman who has lived in \nACHA’s McBride development since approximately 1992. She lives alone in a two-bedroom \nunit. \n11.  Barbara Holder is a 70-year-old African-American woman who has lived in \nACHA’s McBride development since approximately 1970. She lives alone in a three-bedroom \nunit. \n12.  Pamela Purdiman is a 41-year-old African-American woman who has lived in \nACHA’s Elmwood development since approximately September 2015. Before that, she lived in \nACHA’s McBride Development between April 2001 and August of 2012 or 2013. She lives \nalone in a two-bedroom unit. When she lived in McBride, she lived with her minor children. \n13.  William Frey is a 55-year-old Caucasian man who has lived in ACHA’s \nShoemaker development since approximately June 2015. He lives alone in a one-bedroom unit. \n14.  Kimberly Simelton is a 41-year-old Caucasian woman who has lived in ACHA’s \nElmwood development on and off since approximately 1994. She has been in her current unit \nsince approximately 2008. She lives in a three-bedroom unit with her husband, Kenneth \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 4 of 20   Page ID #4\nSimelton, and her 19-year-old daughter. Her daughter has always lived with her in her ACHA \nunit. \n15.  Shameka Nelson is an African-American woman who lives with her seven \nchildren, ages one to twelve, in a six-bedroom unit in ACHA’s McBride development.  \n16.  Defendant Alexander County Housing Authority is an Illinois municipal \ncorporation, created and existing under the Illinois Housing Authorities Act, 310 Ill. Comp. Stat. \n10/1 et seq. ACHA is a public housing agency within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1437. ACHA \nis a recipient of federal financial assistance and is considered to be a program or activity with \noperations subject to Title VI. 24 C.F.R. § 1.2(f). ACHA operates 478 public housing units \nwithin Alexander County.  \n17.  Defendant James Wilson was ACHA’s Executive Director from 1989 to 2013. He \ncontinued working for ACHA on a part-time consultant basis from 2013 to 2015. He returned to \nthe Executive Director position for an 11-day period in early 2015. \n18.  Defendant Martha Franklin worked as ACHA’s Executive Director from April \n2013 to January 2015. She has worked as ACHA’s Finance Director from 2015 to the present. \n19.  Defendant Thomas Upchurch worked as ACHA’s Executive Director from \napproximately March 2015 to October 2015.  \n20.  Defendant Joanne Pink worked as ACHA’s Executive Director from October \n2015 to January 2016. \n21.  In February 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) took over the operations of ACHA pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 907. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 5 of 20   Page ID #5\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nHISTORY OF RACE DISCRIMINATON AT ACHA \n \n22.  ACHA has had a long history of discriminating against African-American \nresidents based on their race. \n23.  In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against ACHA for \nintentionally segregating its two main public housing complexes by race. At the time, Elmwood \nwas reserved for white residents, and Pyramid Courts (now McBride) was reserved for African-\nAmerican residents. \n24.  The lawsuit was eventually settled, and ACHA agreed to stop segregating its \nhousing based on race. ACHA agreed to prioritize occupancy such that Pyramid Courts would \nhave 71 white residents (out of 237), and Elmwood would have 39 black tenants (out of 159). \nDefendants Have Segregated Residents on the Basis of Race \nAnd Perpetuated Racial Segregation \n \n25.  Today, ACHA has returned to its discriminatory past by engaging in a pattern and \npractice of segregating residents on the basis of race. Approximately 97% of the residents living \nin McBride and Elmwood are African-American, while white households predominate in the \ndevelopments of Meadows, Johnson, Sunset Terrace, King, and Connell Smith. This is true even \nthough African-Americans make up just 36% of the residents within Alexander County, \nACHA’s service area.  \nDefendants Fail to Maintain McBride and Elmwood, \nForcing The Residents To Live In Squalor \n \n26.  ACHA, through its Executive Directors, have engaged in a pattern and practice of \nallowing the McBride and Elmwood developments to deteriorate, while preserving and \nmaintaining the Connell Smith development in satisfactory condition. Defendants have engaged \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 6 of 20   Page ID #6\nin a pattern and practice of allowing the housing conditions at McBride and Elmwood to \ndeteriorate because of the residents’ race, African-American.  \n27.  For several years, units located at McBride and Elmwood – including those \noccupied by Plaintiffs – have been infested with roaches, mice, and bedbugs. Despite residents’ \ncomplaints, ACHA has done little to nothing to address the problem.  \n28.  Many of the units at McBride and Elmwood have mold as well as plumbing and \nelectrical deficiencies. Defendants have been aware of these problems for years, yet they have \nfailed to meaningfully address them.  \n29.  There is significant gun violence and other crime at McBride and Elmwood, yet \nACHA has done very little to increase security at these developments. At the same time, ACHA \nhas devoted security resources to Connell Smith and Shoemaker, where there is far less crime \nand no gun violence. \n30.  While ACHA was under the control of Defendants Wilson and Franklin, ACHA \nwasted resources on excessive employee retirement bonuses, unnecessary post retirement \ncontracts, and unjustified travel expenses. These unjustified expenses are chronicled in an \nAugust 23, 2015 article entitled, “Chaos in Cairo” published by the newspaper, The Southern \nIllinoisan. \n31.  In part because of these unjustified payouts to current and former employees, \nACHA has been unable to address the serious pest and rodent infestations or other conditions \nproblems at McBride and Elmwood. \n32.  Wilson, Upchurch, Pink, and Franklin all worked as ACHA Executive Director \nduring relevant time periods. None of them took action to meaningfully alleviate the pest and \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 7 of 20   Page ID #7\nrodent problems at McBride and Elmwood, nor did they take action to meaningfully alleviate the \ncrime, mold, and plumbing problems. \nHUD Finds That ACHA Discriminated Against Residents Based On Race \n33.  On September 30, 2014, HUD issued a letter to ACHA finding that it had violated \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VI”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. See Exhibit A (HUD letter to \nACHA). HUD determined that ACHA violated Title VI by engaging in intentional racial \nsegregation in McBride and Elmwood. Id. \n34.  HUD also found that ACHA was well aware of the security and conditions issues \nat McBride and Elmwood, but failed to provide adequate maintenance and security resources to \neither development.  \n35.  HUD concluded that ACHA’s segregation of the developments by race and its \ncorresponding failure to maintain McBride and Elmwood resulted in an adverse impact on \nAfrican-American families and residents. \n36.  Despite these findings, ACHA, Wilson, Franklin, Upchurch, and Pink continued \ntheir pattern and practice of segregating families based on race and familial status and continued \nto allow the conditions at McBride and Elmwood to deteriorate because of the residents’ race. \nACHA’s Enforces A Rule That Discriminates Against Families With Children \n37.  All of ACHA’s 478 units are designated as family public housing. \n38.  However, for at least the past ten years, ACHA, through its Executive Directors, \nhave implemented a rule prohibiting families with children from living in Connell Smith, \nShoemaker, and several of the scattered site developments and improperly reserved them for \nseniors and people with disabilities.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 8 of 20   Page ID #8\n39.  Neither Connell Smith nor Shoemaker nor the scattered-site programs satisfy the \nFair Housing Act’s definition of “housing for older persons” as defined at 42 U.S.C. § \n3607(b)(2).  \n40.  ACHA never sought to re-designate Connell Smith, Shoemaker, or the scatted site \nprograms under PIH Notice 2005-2 prior to implementing this rule barring families with minor \nchildren and designating certain buildings as senior/disabled housing.  \n41.  Wilson, Upchurch, Pink, and Franklin worked as ACHA Executive Director \nduring relevant time periods. They all enforced the rule prohibiting families with children from \nliving in Connell Smith, Shoemaker and the scattered site developments \nACHA Charges Residents More Than Thirty Percent \nof Their Adjusted Income For Rent \n \n42.  In 1969 the United States Congress enacted legislation, known as the “Brooke \nAmendment” to ensure that low-income public housing residents pay no more than a certain \npercentage of their income toward rent, which includes reasonable utility expenses. 42 U.S.C. § \n1437(a)(a)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 583.351; 24 C.F.R. § 5.611. \n43.  This federal law and implementing regulations prohibit ACHA from requiring \npublic housing residents to pay more than 30% of their adjusted income towards rent. Id. Despite \nthis federal mandate, for at least the past ten years, ACHA has had a practice or policy of \ncharging residents more than 30% of their adjusted income for rent, in violation of the Brooke \nAmendment and its implementing regulations. \n44.  On information and belief, during each year that they lived in a ACHA unit, \nPlaintiffs signed a lease with ACHA that provided as follows: \nThe amount of the Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent shall be determined by the \n[Public Housing Authority] in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements and in \naccordance with the [Public Housing Authority’s] Admissions and Occupancy Policy. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 9 of 20   Page ID #9\n \nSee Exhibit B (Copy of Sample Residential Lease Agreement).  \n \n45.  Mary Holder lives alone in a two-bedroom unit located at 522 McBride Court, \nCairo, IL \n46.  At the time of her most recent rent determination, Mary Holder’s monthly gross \nincome was approximately $833. ACHA charges her $234 per month in income-based rent. \n47.  According to HUD regulations, Mary Holder’s adjusted income is approximately \n$433, and she should not pay more than thirty percent of that amount, or approximately $130, in \nincome-based rent. \n48.  Barbara Holder lives alone in a three-bedroom unit located at 809 McBride Court, \nCairo, IL. \n49.  At the time of her most recent rent determination, Barbara Holder’s monthly gross \nincome was approximately $837. ACHA charges her $238 per month in income-based rent. \n50.  According to HUD regulations, Barbara Holder’s adjusted income is \napproximately $437, and she should not pay more than thirty percent of that amount, or \napproximately $131, in income-based rent. \n51.  William Frey lives alone in a one-bedroom unit located at 410 Shoemaker, 1100 \nHalliday Ave., Cairo, IL.   \n52.  At the time of his most recent rent determination, Frey’s monthly gross income \nwas approximately $733. ACHA charges him $210 per month in income-based rent. \n53.  According to HUD regulations, Frey’s adjusted income is approximately $333, \nand he should not pay more than thirty percent of that amount, or approximately $100, in \nincome-based rent. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 10 of 20   Page ID #10\n54.  Shameka Nelson lives with her seven children, ages 1 – 12, in a six-bedroom unit \nlocated at 422 McBride in Cairo, IL.  She has lived in that unit since 2012.  \n55.  At the time of her most recent rent determination, Nelson’s monthly gross income \nwas approximately $1,597 per month. ACHA charges her $395 per month in income-based rent. \n56.      According to HUD regulations, Nelson’s adjusted income is zero. As a result, \nshe should not pay more than the minimum rent of $50 per month. \n57.  ACHA did not calculate rent for Plaintiffs Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, \nand Nelson in accordance with HUD regulations. 24 C.F.R. § 583.351; 24 C.F.R. § 5.611. \nSpecifically, ACHA charged Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson more than 30% of \ntheir adjusted income for rent. \n58.  As a result, ACHA breached its leases with Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, \nand Nelson causing them substantial monetary injury.  \n59.  Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson substantially performed their \nobligations under their residential leases with ACHA. \n60.  Wilson, Upchurch, Pink, and Franklin worked as ACHA’s Executive Director \nduring the past two years and were responsible for ensuring that residents’ rent was calculated in \naccordance with HUD regulations. They were aware of the manner that ACHA calculated \nresidents’ rent, yet they did nothing to correct the rent overcharges. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n61.  Plaintiffs Lambert, Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Purdiman, and Nelson bring \ntheir race discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 11 of 20   Page ID #11\n62.  Plaintiffs Lambert, Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Purdiman, and Nelson bring \ntheir claims on behalf of a proposed “McBride Elmwood Race Discrimination Subclass” \ndefined as, “All current and former African-American ACHA public housing residents who lived \nin McBride or Elmwood in the past two years.” \n63.  Plaintiffs Simelton and Nelson bring their familial status discrimination claims \nunder the Fair Housing Act on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated pursuant to \nRules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n64.  Simelton and Nelson bring their claims on behalf of a proposed “McBride \nElmwood Familial Status Discrimination Subclass” defined as, “All current and former \nACHA public housing residents who lived in McBride or Elmwood in the past two years with \nminor children.” \n65.  Plaintiffs Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson bring their claims under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and their ACHA residential leases on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n66.  Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson bring their claims on behalf of a \nproposed “Rent Overcharge Subclass” defined as, “All current and former residents of ACHA-\nowned public housing units who – in the past ten years – paid more than $50 per month in \nincome-based rent.”  \n67.  Numerosity. The classes are so numerous that joinder of all of their members is \nimpracticable. Upon information and belief, each subclass is comprised of more than 1,000 \nindividuals. The putative class members are unlikely to press their claims on an individual basis \nbecause as residents of public housing, all putative class members have limited incomes, and the \nvalue of their individual claims is modest. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 12 of 20   Page ID #12\n68.  Commonality and Predominance. Common questions of fact and law \npredominate over questions affecting individual class members. Questions of law and fact \ncommon to the classes include:  \na)  whether ACHA discriminated against residents in McBride and Elmwood based on \ntheir race by refusing to maintain those developments and by prohibiting them from living \nin Connell Smith and certain scattered site developments.  \n \nb)  whether ACHA discriminated against residents in McBride and Elmwood based on \ntheir familial status by refusing to allow families with children to live in Connell Smith and \nShoemaker and certain scattered site developments. \n \nc)  whether ACHA charged residents more than 30% of their adjusted income for rent, \nin violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1437a;  \n \nd)  whether ACHA breached its public housing lease with class members by not \ncharging rent in accordance with HUD regulations \n \n69.  Typicality and Adequacy. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the classes as a whole. \nAll of the Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same unlawful practices: ACHA’s policy of \novercharging residents for rent in violation of the United States Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n1437(a) and its implementing regulations, and discriminating against residents in McBride and \nElmwood based on their race and familial status. Plaintiffs do not present claims that are unique \nto themselves and instead bring claims typical to the class members. Proposed class \nrepresentatives and class counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes as \na whole. Plaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic to those of other class members. By \nfiling this action, Plaintiffs have displayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the \nclaims of others who are similarly situated. Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel. \n70.  Superiority. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy because it will: \na.  avoid the heavy burden of multiple, duplicative suits; \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 13 of 20   Page ID #13\nb.  avoid the virtually impossible task of getting all class members to intervene as \nparty-plaintiffs in this action; \n \nc.  allow the Court, upon adjudication of defendant’s liability, to determine the claims \nof all class members; and  \n \nd.  allow the Court to enter appropriate final monetary relief with respect to the classes \nas a whole. \n \n71.  Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. ACHA has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the Rule 23(b)(2) class as a whole, so that final injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. For years, ACHA has \ndiscriminated against the residents of McBride and Elmwood based on their race and familial \nstatus, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act. \nINJURY TO THE PLAINTIFFS \n72.  Defendants’ actions threaten Plaintiffs with imminent and irreparable injury, \nincluding deteriorating housing, crime, discrimination, segregation, and the overpayment of \nrents.  \n73.  Defendants’ actions have the purpose and effect of limiting housing opportunities \nfor racial minorities and families with children. \n74.  Defendants’ actions disproportionately deny housing opportunities in Alexander \nCounty to racial minorities and families with children. \n75.  According to the 2014 American Community Survey, Alexander County contains \nan estimated total of 7,821 people, of whom 59.7% are non-Hispanic white and 35.9% are \nAfrican-American. African-Americans in Alexander County are disproportionately poor. 53.8% \nof African-American households in Alexander County earn incomes below the federal poverty \nline, compared to 19.7% of non-Hispanic white households. In 2014, 85.7% of African-\nAmerican households in Alexander County were income eligible for federally assisted housing, \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 14 of 20   Page ID #14\ncompared to 59.8% of non-Hispanic white households in Alexander County. While African-\nAmericans comprise 35.9% of Alexander County’s population, approximately 45.2% of \nAlexander County households who are eligible for federally assisted housing are African-\nAmerican. \n76.  According to the 2014 American Community Survey, Alexander County contains \n2,826 households, of which 25.7% include children under the age of 18. Families with children \nunder the age of 18 in Alexander County are disproportionately poor. 60.3% of such households \nearn incomes below the federal poverty line, compared to 30.3% of households overall. In 2014, \n80.3% of Alexander County households with children under the age of 18 were income eligible \nfor federally assisted housing, compared with 46.1% of Alexander County households with no \nchildren under the age of 18 in the household.  \n77.  African-Americans also disproportionately reside in ACHA’s public housing. \nAlmost 80% of ACHA’s units contain a head of household who is African-American. \n78.   Through their actions described above, Defendants have acted negligently, \nintentionally, maliciously, and with willful, malicious, wanton, and reckless disregard for federal \nand state fair housing and non-discrimination laws. \n79.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to create a severe hardship for \nplaintiffs. \n80.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00513-MJR-RJD   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 15 of 20   Page ID #15\nLEGAL CLAIMS \n \nCOUNT I – FAIR HOUSING ACT CLAIM \nDISPARATE TREATMENT BASED ON RACE \n(On Behalf of the McBride Elmwood Race Discrimination \nSubclass Against All Defendants) \n \n81.
