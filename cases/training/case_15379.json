    "summary": "<p>This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (“H.B. 2”), which was passed on March 23, 2016. For the others, see related cases section, below. </p><p>On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.</p><p>In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibits municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removes the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also requires that in government buildings, individuals may only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. For many transgender people, this prevents them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules). In addition, the legislation changes the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,” which prevents discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. </p><p>On May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violates federal law. The DOJ asked the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9 that he will remedy the violations, \"including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.\"</p><p>Instead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking declaratory relief that HB2 didn’t violate federal law. The next day, on May 10, this suit was brought by an unincorporated, non-profit association which seems to serve primarily as vehicle for the right-wing Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom to challenge the DOJ's and DOE’s positions on transgender bathroom access. They sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 2201, asking the court to rule that the North Carolina Law doesn’t violate Title IX of The Education Amendment, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, or the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 (VAWA, 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)). They asked the court to find that the DOJ and DOE had violated the constitution and federal law by threatening North Carolina with legal action. And they asked the court to enjoin those agencies from any action against North Carolina for enforcing HB2s restrictions on transgender bathroom access.</p><p>On May 24, plaintiffs asked the judge assigned to this case, Judge Louise Wood Flannagan, to consolidate this case with the case brought against the DOJ by Governor McCroy, <i>Carcaño</i>. Previously, when the plaintiffs in another lawsuit defending HB2, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15381\">Berger v. United States DOJ</a>, sought consolidation with <i>Carcaño</i>, governor McCrory had indicated that he would oppose consolidation if it interfered with his request to have the case moved to the middle district of North Carolina. On June 14, 2016, the DOJ filed a memorandum opposing consolidation of this case with <i>Carcaño</i>, noting that the plaintiffs in this case were challenging the DOJ’s position that HB2 violates Title IX while the plaintiffs in the <i>Carcaño</i> and <i>Berger</i> cases were not. </p><p>On June 29, 2016, Judge Louise Wood Flannagan denied the motion to consolidate the cases, holding that <i>Carcaño</i> was a less rigorous case, while <i>Berger</i> and the present case raised multiple different questions. Nevertheless, at the same time, the court decided to transfer the cases to the Middle District, holding they should be tried alongside <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15261\">Carcaño</a> because they involved common questions and was filed first. The court was also stated that the transfer would benefit the parties, who would have a single judge rendering timely decisions and coordinating the proceedings, and the public, that would be benefited by consistent decisions by the same judge.</p><p>The case was transferred to the Middle District on June 30, 2016 (Docket No. 1:16-cv-00845). On August 22, 2016, the plaintiff filed its first amended complaint, for the purpose of adding individual plaintiffs and streamlining the language of the original claims, without adding new ones. However, on August 31, 2016, without explanation, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the case without prejudice to the defendants. As a result, the case was closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "After DOJ indicates that it believes a North Carolina law limiting transgender individuals access to bathrooms violates federal law, the private non-profit association North Carolinian for Privacy brought suit in the Eastern District of North Carolina asking for declaratory and injunctive relief. They asked the court to say that the law doesn't violate the laws cited by the DOJ, to say that the DOJ's actions and a guidance document by the DOE that the DOJ cited are illegal and unconstitutional, and to issue an injunction against the DOJ and DOE to prevent them from taking legal action against North Carolina for enforcing the new law's restrictions on transgender bathroom access. After the case was transferred to the Middle District of North Carolina, however, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.",

L.C., 527 U.S. 581  (1999).  \nPlaintiffs bring a putative class  action challenging  Defendants’ administration of  \nservices for children in foster care, including the manner in which Defendants provide \n                                                 \n1  Congress has authorized the Attorney General to send “any officer of the Department of  \nJustice .  .  . to any .  .  . district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United  \nStates in a suit pending in a court of the United States.”   28 U.S.C. § 517.  \n \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   2  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 2 of 20 \n\nservices to children with disabilities, whom Plaintiffs allege are unnecessarily placed in  \ninstitutional settings.   See  Am. Compl., ECF  No. 16,  ¶¶  260-63, 298-308; 42 U.S.C.  \n§  12132; 29 U.S.C. §  794; Olmstead  v.  L.C.,  527 U.S. 581  (1999).  Defendants filed a \nMotion to Dismiss  on August 26, 2022  that  argues, among other things,  that Plaintiffs \nhave failed to state a claim under the ADA and Section 504.   Def.’s Br. in Supp. of Mot. \nto Dismiss (Def.’s Br.), ECF No. 23, at  70-75.   Contrary to Defendants’  arguments  in  \nsupport of  their Motion: (1) an individual who is at serious risk of  institutionalization \nmay  allege a violation of  the ADA’s and Section 504’s integration mandate; (2) there are  \nmultiple ways to demonstrate that community-based services are appropriate for an \nindividual, only one of which is a determination by the state’s own treatment \nprofessionals; and (3) providing  access to  services in a community  setting when the state  \nhas already  established  those services may be a reasonable modification of  the  state’s \nservice system if the unavailability  of those services causes serious risk of unnecessary  \ninstitutionalization.  \nInterest of the United  States  \nThe United States submits this Statement of Interest because this litigation \nimplicates the proper interpretation and application of Title II of the ADA and Section  \n504.   As the federal agency charged with enforcement and implementation of the ADA,2  \n                                                 \n2  The Department of Justice has an open  investigation to determine whether the State of  \nAlaska unnecessarily  institutionalizes children with behavioral health conditions in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA.  \n \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   3  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 3 of 20 \n\nthe Department of Justice has an interest in supporting the proper and uniform application \nof the ADA, in furthering Congress’s intent to create “clear, strong, consistent,  \nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,”  \nand in furthering Congress’s intent to reserve a “central role” for the federal government  \nin enforcing the standards established in the ADA.3   42 U.S.C. §§ 12133-12134,  \n12101(b)(2), 12101(b)(3).   \nPlaintiffs’  Factual Allegations  \nPlaintiffs are Alaskan children in the child welfare system  who bring this putative \nclass action against state Defendants for violating their rights under the U.S. Constitution, \nthe ADA, Section 504,  and various federal laws related to the administration of child \nwelfare.  Am. Compl.  ¶¶  264-315.   Defendants include the Alaska Department of  \nHealth and Social Services (DHSS)  and  the Alaska Office of Children’s Services (OCS).   \nId.  ¶¶  23-26.  Named Plaintiffs are in OCS custody  and  have health conditions such as  \nautism, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, depression, and anxiety.  Id.  ¶¶  12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 42,  \n43, 69, 79, 84, 92, 94, 98, 106, 108, 113, 124, 300.  With regard to the ADA and Section \n504  claims,  Plaintiffs also bring this action on behalf of  a  broader class  of  “[c]hildren \nwho are or will be in foster care and experience physical,  cognitive, and psychiatric \n                                                 \n3  The Department of  Justice also coordinates  federal agencies’ implementation and \nenforcement of Section 504  and has the authority  to enforce Section 504.  See  28 C.F.R.  \nPart 41; Exec. Order No. 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, 1980); 29 U.S.C. § \n794(a); see also  28 C.F.R. § 0.51(b)(3).   \n \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   4  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 4 of 20 \n\ndisabilities.”  Id.  ¶  28(d).  \nThe  Complaint  alleges  that OCS fails to  provide community-based services  to \nPlaintiffs with disabilities  that  would enable them  to live in their homes and communities,  \ninstead of  institutions.

Id.  at  90-94.  \nStatutory and Regulatory Background  \n \nCongress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 \nU.S.C. §  12101(b)(1).  It found that, “historically, society  has tended to isolate and \nsegregate individuals with disabilities” and that “individuals with disabilities continually  \nencounter various forms of discrimination, including .  .  . segregation.”   Id.  \n§§  12101(a)(2) and (5).   Congress determined that “the Nation’s proper goals regarding  \nindividuals with disabilities are to assure equality  of opportunity, full \nparticipation,  independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such \nindividuals.”   Id.  §  12101(a)(7).   Title II of the ADA prohibits disability  discrimination  \nin public services: “[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by  reason of such  \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   6  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 6 of 20 \n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any  such  \nentity.”   Id.  §  12132.   \nCongress directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to implement  \nTitle II.  42 U.S.C. §  12134.   These regulations require public entities,  inter alia, to  \n“administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to  \nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. §  35.130(d) (“the  \nintegration mandate”).4   The “most integrated setting” is one which “enables individuals  \nwith disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  Id.  \nPart 35, App. B.   The regulations also require public entities to “make reasonable  \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary  \nto avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity  can demonstrate  \nthat making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, \nprogram, or activity.”  Id.  §  35.130(b)(7)(i).  \nIn  Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that, under the ADA and its regulations,  \n“unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form  of  \ndiscrimination.”  Olmstead  v.  L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 600 (1999).  The Court reasoned that  \n“institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from  community  settings \n                                                 \n4  Additionally, the Title II regulations provide that “[a] public entity, in providing any  \naid, benefit, or service, may  not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other \narrangements, on the basis of disability . . . [p]rovide  a qualified individual with a \ndisability  with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal  \nopportunity  to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level  \nof achievement as that provided to others.”   28 C.F.R.§ 35.130(b)(1)(iii).  \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   7  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 7 of 20 \n\nperpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy  \nof participating in community life.”  Id.   The Court concluded that individuals with  \ndisabilities are entitled to community-based services when such placement is appropriate,  \nthe affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably  \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the state and the needs of  \nothers with disabilities.   Id.  at 607.5  \nArgument  \nI.   Plaintiffs  Who are Institutionalized or at Serious Risk of \nInstitutionalization  May  Allege a Violation of the Integration Mandate  \n \nThe integration mandate protects persons with disabilities who are unnecessarily  \ninstitutionalized or are at serious risk of such institutionalization.   To the extent  \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs have not alleged a violation of the integration mandate  simply  \nbecause  they  are not presently  institutionalized, that argument must fail.  See  Def.’s Br. \nat 73.  Rather,  as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held,  to properly allege a \nviolation of the integration mandate a plaintiff  need only  plead facts showing  that  “the  \nchallenged state’s  action creates a  serious risk of institutionalization.”   M.R. v. Dreyfus, \n663 F.3d 1100, 1116-17  (9th Cir. 2011), amended by  697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. 2012); see  \nalso  Fisher v. Okla.

Dreyfus, 663 F.3d 1100, 1115 (9th Cir. 2011), amended by  697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. \n2012); see also  Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th Cir. 2013) (holding that Title II  \nand Section 504 “impose the same integration requirements”).  \n \nJeremiah M. et al. v.

See, e.g., M.R., 663 F.3d at 1111, 1113, 1115 (finding plaintiffs had \nshown serious risk where reduction in services critical to their health exacerbated their \nrisk of institutionalization); Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp.  2d 1161, 1171  (N.D. \nCal. 2009)  (granting  preliminary injunction where state placed elderly  plaintiffs with \ndisabilities at serious risk of institutionalization in nursing facilities by  limiting the \navailability  of community-based services).  \nDefendants also argue that  the institutional placements  that Plaintiffs experienced,  \nranging from 30 days to almost a year  and sometimes on a repeated basis,  do not violate \nthe integration mandate  because  they are merely “temporary.”   See  Def.’s  Br. at 74.  \nThat argument lacks legal support and is counter to the Supreme Court’s reasoning in \nOlmstead.  Just as indefinite  isolation and segregation in an institutional setting  \n“severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family  \n                                                 \n6  Serious risk does not require that institutionalization be “inevitable” or that the plaintiff  \nhave “no choice” but to submit to institutional care.

Courts have recognized that policies that risk shorter term \ninstitutionalization  may violate  the  integration mandate.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  \nMississippi, 400 F. Supp. 3d 546,  555, 576  (S.D.

Plaintiffs  Need Not Rely on a State  Treatment Professional’s  \nDetermination to Show  Community-Based Services Are  Appropriate  to \nthe Needs of the Individual  \n \nDefendants argue the  ADA and Section 504 claims  should be dismissed because  \nPlaintiffs fail  to allege that the State’s treatment professionals determined that they  could  \nappropriately  be served in the community.   See  Def.’s Br. at 74.  That argument is \nmisguided.   When alleging a violation of the integration mandate, plaintiffs need not rely  \non a determination by a  state’s treatment professional to demonstrate the appropriateness  \nof  services in a community setting.  \nWhile the facts in Olmstead  included opinions by  the state’s treatment  \nprofessionals, the case did not present the question of whether a state’s treatment  \nprofessionals are the  only  professionals who can determine that community-based \nservices are appropriate.  See  Olmstead,  527  U.S. at 602-03.  Since then, courts have  \nruled that a person asserting a violation of the integration mandate need not rely  on a \nstate’s treatment professionals for the appropriateness determination.   As courts have  \nexplained, to hold otherwise would allow states  to circumvent their obligations under  \nOlmstead  by withholding such determinations.7   See, e.g.,  Mississippi, 400 F. Supp. 3d  \n                                                 \n7  Consistent with  the  rulings of  courts that have considered this issue, the Department of  \nJustice’s  Olmstead  Statement explains that “[a] reasonable, objective assessment by a \npublic entity’s treating professional is one, but only one, such avenue” to show that an \nintegrated setting is appropriate for an individual.

Here, Plaintiffs allege that, before \nplacing  Named Plaintiff  Lana H. in institutional settings, OCS failed to provide her or her  \nfoster parents with services and supports that may  have helped Lana H. remain in the \ncommunity.  See  Am. Compl. ¶¶  127-132, 136.  Similarly, in United States v.  \nMississippi, the United States alleged that Mississippi’s service system  “pushes  \nthousands of people into segregated hospital settings that could have been avoided with  \ncommunity-based services.”  400  F. Supp. 3d at 553.  The court ultimately  found that  \nMississippi violated the integration mandate,  despite the  state’s expert witnesses’  \ntestimony  that individuals were appropriate for a hospital at the time of admission,  \nbecause “community-based services  . . .  are appropriate if they can help persons with \ndisabilities avoid or minimize hospitalization.”   Id. at 569-572, 575-76.  Indeed, the \nOlmstead  decision itself puts to rest any doubt that Defendants’ argument is  wrong.  The \nOlmstead  plaintiffs alleged only that they  were appropriate for community services at the  \ntime of the lawsuit, and not at the time they  were first admitted to the state hospital.  \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at  593.  Public entities  cannot avoid their obligations under the  \nJeremiah M. et al. v. Adam Crum et al.   13  \nCase No.  3:22-cv-00129-JMK  \nCase 3:22-cv-00129-JMK  Document 31  Filed 10/03/22  Page 13 of 20 \n\nintegration mandate by  putting individuals  at serious risk of  unnecessary  \ninstitutionalization and then asserting that institutionalization is  appropriate.  \nMoreover, Defendants’  reliance on the Alaska superior courts’  placement \ndecisions, see  Def.’s  Br. at 74-75,  is insufficient to show that Plaintiffs cannot meet \nOlmstead’s  appropriateness requirement.   This is because Defendants again rely  on the  \nerroneous contention that the only relevant consideration of appropriateness is at the \npoint of admission to an institution and, separately, because the placement criteria used  \nby  the superior courts differ from what Olmstead requires.   More specifically, the  \nsuperior courts’ consideration  of certain residential placements turns on whether  \ncommunity-based services that could be an alternative to institutional placement are  \n“reasonably available.”   See id. at 74.   Whether or not that test is appropriate under state  \nlaw, it does not insulate the State from its independent obligations under Olmstead.   \nUnder the  ADA  and Section 504, public entities have an affirmative obligation to provide \nintegrated, community-based alternatives to institutional care, which could include the  \nexpansion of services, as discussed below.  See  28 C.F.R. §§  35.130(b)(7)(i) \nand  35.130(d).  That obligation to provide appropriate community-based services under  \nOlmstead  does not depend on whether those services are immediately  available.   See  \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  Courts have allowed Olmstead  claims to proceed where \ncommunity-based services are not available to the plaintiff; indeed, the unavailability of  \nservices has been the impetus for many of those claims.   See, e.g., Mississippi, 400 F. \nSupp. 3d at 576; Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at  1175.  \nJeremiah M. et al. v.

Provision of  Community-Based Services Through  a  State’s  Existing \nService  System  to Avoid Unnecessary  Institutionalization  May Constitute  \na Reasonable Modification of the System  \n \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the integration \nmandate  on the grounds that the State  is not required  to ensure  that there are  sufficient \nproviders of community-based services  throughout the state.8   See  Def.’s Br. at 75.  \nDefendants’  argument is based on a flawed understanding of the  applicable  legal  \nframework.   \nWhere a  state  administers a system for providing services to people with \ndisabilities, modifying that system to serve people who qualify for those services in the  \ncommunity, rather than institutions, may  be a reasonable modification, despite \nDefendants’ assertions to the contrary.  See  Def.’s Br. at  75.   Courts have found \nproposed modifications that expand existing services to be reasonable, particularly  when  \nthe modifications align with the public entity’s own stated plans and obligations.  See, \ne.g., Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 280-81 (2d Cir. 2003) (upholding as a  \nreasonable modification an order requiring agency to follow existing law and \nprocedures);  Mississippi, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 576 (finding provision of community-based  \nservices reasonable where the plaintiff showed that the state “already ha[d] the \n                                                 \n8  Defendants also argue that this is not a  reasonable undertaking  for the Court, Def.’s Br.  \nat 75.   However,  reasonableness in the context of a reasonable modification is evaluated  \nfrom the perspective of the defendant, not a court, and should not be conflated with \nredressability.    \n \nJeremiah M. et al. v.

Supp. 2d  \n294, 344-45 (D. Conn. 2008) (plaintiffs’ requested service expansion, which  was  \nconsistent with defendants’ publicly stated plans, was reasonable).   And as the Ninth  \nCircuit observed in  Townsend v. Quasim, expanding the provision of community-based  \nservices to individuals to whom a public entity  already provides institutional services is a \nreasonable modification.  328 F.3d 511, 517-18 (9th Cir. 2003).9   Like the plaintiffs in \nTownsend, Plaintiffs seek  community-based services as alternatives to institutional care.   \nSee  Am. Compl. ¶  263.  \nContrary to  Defendants’  assertion  that the State is not required to ensure  sufficient \ncommunity-based  services, see  Def.’s Br. at  75, a  state may violate the integration \nmandate  by failing to reasonably  modify its service system to expand the availability of  \nexisting community-based services to prevent needless institutionalization.

The plaintiff need only suggest the existence of a plausible  \naccommodation.   See  Townsend, 328 F.3d at 517-18;  Frederick L. v.

A state’s “failure to prevent unnecessary  gaps  \nin service” within its  community service system  may violate the integration mandate “by  \nlimiting  [individuals’] ability to maintain their social and economic  independence and \ndepriving them of a real choice between  home and institutional care.”   Ball v.

States that administer service systems for  \npeople with disabilities  may  not avail themselves of this defense unless they can first \ndemonstrate that they  have a comprehensive, effectively working plan to comply  with the \nOlmstead  mandate.

Plaintiffs bring this declaratory action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. §§ \n2201-02. Plaintiff North Carolinians for Privacy brings this action on behalf \nof  its  members,  who  are  students  in  the  University  of  North  Carolina \nUniversity  System;  students  at  elementary,  middle,  and  high  schools \nthroughout North Carolina; parents of the students who are minor children; \nand victims of sexual assault. The individual Plaintiffs Y.K., A.K., C.K., B.K., \nD.H., D.H., S.H., and R.F., who are also members of North Carolinians for \nPrivacy, bring this action on behalf of themselves as students at elementary, \nmiddle, and high schools throughout North Carolina and as parents of minor \nstudents. \n2.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare that: \na.  The  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Department  of \nEducation  may  not  lawfully  rely  on  and  enforce  the \nDepartment of Education’s redefinition of “sex” in Title IX, \nbecause the Department’s agency action of redefining “sex” \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act; \n2 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 2 of 69\n\nb.  The  maintenance  of  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms, \nand changing facilities by educational institutions does not \nviolate the requirements of Title IX, codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1681 et. seq., which prohibits discrimination in education \nor educational benefits and programs because of a person’s \n“sex”; and  \nc.  The  maintenance  of  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms, \nand changing facilities by educational institutions does not \nviolate the requirements of the  Violence Against Women \nAct  (“VAWA”),  codified  at  42  U.S.C.A.  §§  13925  et  seq., \nwhich  prohibits  discrimination  in  certain  programs  and \nactivities  in  education  because  of  a  person’s  “gender \nidentity.”1 \n3.  Plaintiffs also ask this Court to enjoin Defendants from taking \nany action inconsistent with this Court’s declaration that would affect their \nrights or the rights of the members of North Carolinians for Privacy.  \n                                                 \n1 Unless otherwise noted, Plaintiffs use the terms “sex,” “male,” and “female” \nto indicate one’s sex as determined by chromosomes, birth anatomy, gametes, \nand  reproductive  system.  See  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Diagnostic  and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (“[S]ex and sexual \nrefer  to  the  biological  indicators  of  male  and  female  (understood  in  the \ncontext of reproductive capacity), such as in sex chromosomes, gonads, sex \nhormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.”). \n3 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 3 of 69\n\n4.  The  federal  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”)  sent  letters  to  the \nGovernor of North Carolina, as well as the President of the University of \nNorth Carolina System, on May 4, 2016, demanding that the State and the \nUniversity System allow males to use restrooms, locker rooms, and changing \nfacilities designated for women, and to allow females to use restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities designated for men. \n5.  DOJ’s letters threatened that, if the State of North Carolina and \nthe University System do not comply, DOJ would invoke its power to enforce \nTitle  IX  through  “‘any  other  means  authorized  by  law,’  including  judicial \nenforcement,”  and  to  “enforce  VAWA  through  civil  actions,”  and  revoke \nfederal funds made available pursuant to Title IX and VAWA. \n6.  On May 9, 2016, the DOJ filed suit against the State of North \nCarolina and the University System. \n7.  At  a  press  conference  announcing  the  lawsuit,  United  States \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch stated that DOJ “retain[ed] the option of \ncurtailing federal funding” for North Carolina and its schools, including the \nUniversity System.2 \n                                                 \n2 Department of Justice, “Remarks as prepared for delivery,” May 9, 2016, \navailable  at  https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-\nlynch-delivers-remarks-press-conference-announcing-complaint  (last  visited \nAugust 2, 2016).  \n4 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 4 of 69\n\n8.  In  response  to  a  question  at  the  press  conference,  Attorney \nGeneral Lynch stated that “[i]t would be premature right now to give a date \non when we actually will take that step” of revoking federal funds.3 \n9.  The University System’s spokesperson has publicly stated that \nthe University System’s federal funds, including its students’ eligibility for \nstudent loans, are at stake.4 \n10.  The total amount of federal funds at stake is approximately $1.4 \nbillion, while the total amount of federal student loans that the University \nSystem’s students will lose is approximately $800 million.5 \n11.  Some  of  the  members  of  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  are \nstudents currently within the University System, or will be students within \nthe University System beginning next year. \n                                                 \n3 Jane Stancill, “UNC President Spellings: UNC system caught in middle of \nstate, federal fight on HB2,” The News & Observer, May 9, 2016, available at \nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article76612287.html \n(last visited August 2, 2016). \n4 Emery P. Dalesio, “NC college system’s federal funds in crosshairs of LGBT \nlaw,”  AP,  May  5,  2016,  available  at  https://www.yahoo.com/news/north-\ncarolina-leaders-denounce-federal-threat-lgbt-law-071812744.html  (last \nvisited August 2, 2016). \n5  Pete  Williams  et  al.,  “DOJ  Files  Lawsuit  Challenging  North  Carolina \nBathroom  Law,”  NBC  News,  May  9,  2016,  available  at \nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/north-carolina-gov-pat-mccrory-faces-\nmonday-deadline-lgbt-law-n570396 (last visited August 2, 2016).  \n5 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 5 of 69\n\n12.  All of these students’ educational opportunities will be adversely \nimpacted  if  the  federal  government  revokes  the  federal  funding  that  the \nUniversity System receives.   \n13.  Additionally,  some  of  these  students  receive  currently  Pell \nGrants, federal student loans, or other sources of federal funding, all of which \nis now at risk.  \n14.  These students’ current and future educational opportunities, as \nwell as their financial ability to secure an education at colleges within the \nUniversity  System,  are  directly  jeopardized  by  the  federal  government’s \nthreats, which risk making those students ineligible to receive this federal \nfinancial assistance while attending the University System.   \n15.  Also  included  within  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  are \nelementary and secondary school students and their parents. The individual \nPlaintiffs  A.K.,  C.K.,  B.K.,  D.H.,  and  S.H.  are  elementary  and  secondary \nschool students, and the individual Plaintiffs Y.K. and D.H. are the parents \nof those students. Plaintiff R.F. is similarly a parent of a minor student. \n16.  Their schools are public schools in North Carolina that receive \nfederal funding pursuant to Title IX. \n6 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 6 of 69\n\n17.  They  are  aware  that  the  federal  government  has  previously \nthreatened to revoke federal funding when public school districts sought to \nmaintain sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.   \n18.  DOJ’s letter to the Governor indicates that DOJ requires their \npublic elementary and secondary schools to allow male students entry and \nuse  of  the  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  designated  for \nfemales, and also to allow female students entry and use of the restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities designated for males. \n19.  DOJ is threatening to revoke the federal funding received by the \nschools attended by the individual Plaintiffs and other members of North \nCarolinians for Privacy pursuant to Title IX if the State does not require its \npublic schools to grant such rights of entry and use. \n20.  Their educational opportunities will be adversely impacted if the \nfederal government revokes their schools’ federal funding. \n21.  In its letters to the State and the University System, the DOJ \nrelied on a new rule, created by the Department of Education (“DOE”) and \nthe DOJ, that forbids educational institutions from maintaining sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.   \n22.  DOJ  also  stated  that  Title  IX  and  VAWA  forbid  sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities in educational institutions.  \n7 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 7 of 69\n\n23.  DOE’s action in creating its new rule (“the DOJ/DOE Title IX \nRule”) violates the Administrative Procedure Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 500 \net seq., and is unlawful, as is the DOJ’s reliance on it.  \n24.  Title IX and VAWA both allow for sex-specific restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities. \n25.  Plaintiffs  therefore  seek  a  declaration  from  this  Court  to  that \neffect, in order to put an immediate end to the ongoing threat to their ability \nto access educational opportunities at elementary, middle, and high schools \nthroughout North Carolina and at colleges within the University System. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE   \n26.  This action arises under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 (the “Declaratory \nJudgments Act”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500 et seq. (the “Administrative Procedure Act” \nor the “APA”), and 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq. (“Title IX”).  \n27.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343, 1361, and 1367. \n28.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  the  requested  declaratory \nrelief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§  2201  and  2202  and  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 57.   \n8 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 8 of 69\n\n29.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  award  the  requested  injunctive \nrelief under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 703, 20 U.S.C. § 1683, and Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 65. \n30.  The Court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n31.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e), \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims occurred in this district.  \nPLAINTIFFS \nNorth Carolinians for Privacy \n32.  Plaintiff North Carolinians for Privacy is an unincorporated non-\nprofit association organized under N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 59B-1 through B-\n15, and headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. \n33.  North Carolinians for Privacy exists to advocate for, and protect, \nbodily privacy in the State of North Carolina and to ensure that its members \nneed  not  give  up  their  right  to  privacy  in  order  to  access  educational \nopportunities  at  elementary,  middle,  and  high  schools  throughout  North \nCarolina and at colleges within the University System. \n34.  Its members have an interest in this litigation because the action \nof  Defendants  threaten  bodily  privacy  rights  in  North  Carolina  and  their \n9 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 9 of 69\n\nability to continue to access educational opportunities at elementary, middle, \nand  high  schools  throughout  North  Carolina  and  at  colleges  within  the \nUniversity System.    \n35.  North Carolinians for Privacy’s members are all United States \ncitizens and residents of the State of North Carolina. \n36.  Some  of  its  members  are  directly  impacted  by  Defendants’ \nactions, which threaten to revoke federal funding if the State and University \nSystem do not allow males the right of entry and use of restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities designated for females, and vice versa.   \n37.  Some of its members are students within the University of North \nCarolina System (the “University Students”), or will be matriculating next \nschool year as freshmen to colleges within the University System.   \n38.  Some of its members are students in North Carolina elementary \nschools,  middle  schools,  or  high  schools  that  receive  federal  funding  (the \n“Minor Students”). \n39.  Some  of  its  members  are  parents  of  Minor  Students  (the \n“Parents”). \n40.  Some of its members are victims of sexual assault.    \n10 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 10 of 69\n\nThe Individual Plaintiffs \n41.  Plaintiff  A.K.,  a  minor,  was  enrolled  in  a  school  within  the \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  School  System  last  school  year  and  is  currently \naccepted to and plans to attend Queens Grant High School in the 2016-2017 \nschool year. Plaintiff Y.K. is the parent and legal guardian of A.K. \n42.  On information and belief, Queens Grant High School does not \ncomply with the DOJ/DOE Title IX Rule. \n43.  On information and belief, Queens Grant High School receives \nfederal funding and thus is subject to the legal requirements of Title IX. \n44.  On  information  and  belief,  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School \nSystem  implemented  a  policy  during  the  summer  of  2016  that  ignores \ngoverning state law in order to comply with the DOJ/DOE Title XI rule. \n45.  On  information  and  belief,  this  new  policy  was  put  on  hold \nbecause of the Supreme Court’s stay of the mandate in Gloucester County \nSchool Board v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm, No. 16A52, 2016 WL 4131636, at *1 (U.S. \nAug. 3, 2016).  \n46.  On  information  and  belief,  students  attend  the  Charlotte-\nMecklenburg  School  System  who  profess  a  gender  identity  that  does  not \nmatch their sex.  \n11 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 11 of 69\n\n47.  On  information  and  belief,  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School \nSystem’s new policy, once it takes effect, will permit students who profess a \ngender identity that does not match their sex to access multi-user facilities \ndesignated for the opposite sex, including showers, locker rooms, restrooms, \nchanging facilities, and lodging facilities while traveling. \n48.  On information and belief, under the new policy, once it takes \neffect, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System will not notify parents or \nstudents  that  a  member  of  the  opposite  sex  is  accessing  multi-user  sex-\ndesignated facilities, including showers, locker rooms, restrooms, changing \nfacilities, and lodging facilities while traveling. \n49.  While enrolled in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System, A.K. \nwas  required  to  change  clothes  at  school  for  curricular  activities.  This \nincluded being in a state of undress within a large open single-sex locker \nroom. No private changing stalls were available in the locker room. \n50.  On  information  and  belief,  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School \nSystem’s new policy, which will permit members of the opposite sex to access \nmulti-user  sex-designated  showers,  locker  rooms,  changing  facilities,  and \nliving  facilities  while  traveling,  was  adopted  in  order  to  comply  with  the \nDOJ/DOE Title XI Rule. \n12 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 12 of 69\n\n51.  A.K. experienced anxiety and discomfort at the thought of being \nin a state of undress in front of a member of the opposite sex. \n52.  During the summer of 2016, A.K.’s parents transferred A.K. to \nQueens Grant High School from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System in \norder to protect A.K.’s privacy rights and alleviate the tremendous anxiety \nand discomfort that A.K. was experiencing at the thought of living under the \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg School System’s new policy. \n53.  On information and belief, Queens Grant High School does not \npermit students of the opposite sex to share multi-user sex-specific locker \nrooms,  showers,  restrooms,  changing  facilities,  or  living  facilities  while \ntraveling. Therefore, that school does not comply with the DOJ/DOE Title XI \nrule. \n54.  Parent Plaintiff Y.K. expends additional funds to transport A.K. \nto Queens Grant High School that would not have been expended if Y.K. had \nnot  been  forced  to  remove  A.K.  from  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School \nSystem. \n55.  Plaintiff C.K., a minor, currently attends a middle school within \nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System. Plaintiff Y.K. is the parent and \nlegal guardian of C.K.  \n13 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 13 of 69\n\n56.  C.K.  is  required  to  change  clothes  at  school  for  curricular \nactivities. This includes being in a state of undress within a large open single-\nsex locker room.  \n57.  C.K. experiences anxiety, discomfort, and embarrassment at the \nthought of being in a state of undress in front of a member of the opposite \nsex. She is not aware of any private single-stall changing facilities. But even \nif she were, she would feel ostracized from the rest of her peers by being \nrequired  to  change  away  from  the  rest  of  the  girls  in  order  to  avoid \nundressing in front of a male or seeing a male undress in front of her. \n58.  The fact that a male may profess a female gender identity does \nnot  reduce  C.K.’s  anxiety  at  the  thought  of  undressing  in  front  that \nindividual or having that individual undress in front of her. She also fears \nthat some males may profess a female identity as a pretense to access the \nlocker room where she is changing. \n59.  C.K. has been fearful and anxious about returning to school this \nyear  because  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School  System’s  new  policy \nregarding sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities. While \nher anxiety has been slightly allayed because the new policy is currently on \nhold, the thought that she will have to undress in the presence of males, and \n14 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 14 of 69\n\nbe subject to males undressing in front of her, once that policy goes into effect \nis deeply distressing to her. \n60.  C.K., through her parents, applied to move to a tuition-free school \nthat protects her privacy and does not permit students of the opposite sex to \nshare multi-user locker rooms, showers, restrooms, or living facilities while \ntraveling. But she was waitlisted for enrollment.  \n61.  Y.K. cannot afford to enroll C.K. in a private school that does not \nreceive  funds  subject  to  the  DOJ/DOE  Title  IX  rule  without  experiencing \ngreat financial hardship.   \n62.  B.K., a minor, attends an elementary school within the Charlotte \nMecklenburg School System. Plaintiff Y.K. is the parent and legal guardian \nof B.K.  \n63.  B.K.  uses  the  restroom  at  school  and  feels  anxious  and \nuncomfortable  at  the  thought  that  once  the  school’s  new  policy  goes  into \neffect, he may encounter a member of the opposite sex in the restrooms at \nschool. B.K. is confused and anxious about this. \n64.  B.K. applied to move to a tuition-free school that protects B.K.’s \nprivacy and does not permit students of the opposite sex to share multi-user \nrestrooms and changing facilities. But he was waitlisted for enrollment.  \n15 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 15 of 69\n\n65.  Y.K. cannot afford to enroll B.K. in a private school that does not \nreceive  funds  subject  to  the  DOJ/DOE  Title  IX  rule  without  experiencing \ngreat financial hardship.  \n66.  Y.K. is a Christian who teaches his children that boys and girls \nare uniquely made, that God designed them differently, and that it would \nviolate their religious beliefs about modesty for them to undress, shower, or \nuse the restroom in the presence of a member of the opposite sex. \n67.  A.K, C.K., and B.K. are Christians who believe based on their \nfaith’s teachings about modesty that they cannot undress, shower, or use the \nrestroom in the presence of a member of the opposite sex. \n68.  Y.K. believes that it is his duty as a parent to train his children \naccording  to  his  religious  beliefs  and  to  ensure  that  their  privacy  is  not \nviolated. \n69.  Plaintiff D.H., a minor, attends a high school within the Union \nCounty Public School System. Plaintiff D.H. is the parent and legal guardian \nof minor child D.H. \n70.  Minor child D.H. participates in school-related sports activities \nand is required to use the locker rooms to change clothes at school.  \n71.  Minor child D.H. is anxious and uncomfortable at the thought of \nundressing in front of a member of the opposite sex, or being exposed to an \n16 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 16 of 69\n\nundressed member of the opposite sex, regardless of whether that person \nprofesses a different gender identity.  \n72.  If minor child D.H.’s school implements policies conforming to the \nDOJ/DOE Title XI rule, it would cause D.H.’s anxiety and distress to increase \nexponentially. That would force parent D.H. to take steps, at considerable \nexpense and inconvenience, to remove minor child D.H. from the school in \nwhich D.H. is currently enrolled.  \n73.  Plaintiff S.H., a minor, attends a high school within the Union \nCounty Public School System. Plaintiff D.H. is the parent and legal guardian \nof S.H. \n74.  S.H.  participates  in  school-related  sports  activities  and  is \nrequired to use the locker rooms to change clothes at school. \n75.  S.H. is anxious and uncomfortable at the thought of undressing \nin front of a member of the opposite sex, or being exposed to an undressed \nmember of the opposite sex, regardless of whether that person professes a \ndifferent gender identity. \n76.  S.H. is particularly anxious because she has encountered a male \nin a public restroom in the past. She was very unsettled by the experience \nand hid in a stall until the person left. \n17 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 17 of 69\n\n77.  If S.H.’s school implements policies conforming to the DOJ/DOE \nTitle  XI  rule,  it  would  cause  S.H.’s  anxiety  and  distress  to  increase \nexponentially. That would force D.H. to take steps, at considerable expense \nand inconvenience, to remove S.H. from her school. \n78.  Parent D.H. is a Christian who teaches D.H. and S.H. that boys \nand girls are uniquely made, that God designed them differently, and that it \nwould  violate  their  religious  beliefs  about  modesty  for  them  to  undress, \nshower, or use the restroom in the presence of a member of the opposite sex. \n79.  Minor children D.H. and S.H. are Christians who believe based \non their faith’s teachings about modesty that they cannot undress, shower, or \nuse the restroom in the presence of a member of the opposite sex. \n80.  Parent D.H. believes that it is her duty as a parent to train her \nchildren according to her religious beliefs and to ensure that their privacy \nand safety is not violated. \n81.  Plaintiff R.F. is the parent and legal guardian of a female minor \nwho attends North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham, \nNorth Carolina.  \n82.  North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics is a resident \nschool and R.F.’s daughter lives in the dorms on campus, where she  also \nchanges and showers. \n18 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 18 of 69\n\n83.  North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics is subject to \nthe DOJ/DOE Title IX Rule, but currently maintains secure-access-controlled \ndormitories based on sex. \n84.  On information and belief, students attend the North Carolina \nSchool of Science and Mathematics who profess a gender identity that does \nnot match their sex, including students who are male but identify as female. \n85.  Under the new DOJ/DOE Title IX Rule, North Carolina School of \nScience and Mathematics will be forced to either forgo federal funding or \npermit male students to live in the female dormitories. \n86.  Because of the new DOJ/DOE Title IX Rule, R.F. is anxious and \ngreatly concerned that his daughter will either have to stop attending North \nCarolina  School  of  Science  and  Mathematics  or  be  forced  to  share  living \nfacilities with one or more males.  \n87.  Parent R.F. is a Christian who teaches his daughter that males \nand females are uniquely made, that God designed them differently, and that \nit  would  violate  his  religious  beliefs  about  modesty  for  her  to  undress, \nshower, or use the restroom in the presence of a member of the opposite sex.  \n88.  Parent R.F. believes that it is his duty as a parent to train his \nchild according to his religious beliefs and to ensure that her privacy is not \nviolated.  \n19 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 19 of 69\n\n89.  If  the  North  Carolina  School  of  Science  and  Mathematics \ncomplies with the new DOJ/DOE Title IX Rule, R.F. will have to examine \nalternate means of education and potentially move his daughter to a different \nschool at considerable expense.  \n90.  No  other  school  in  North  Carolina  provides  the  same  unique \neducational  opportunities  and  experience  as  the  North  Carolina  School  of \nScience and Mathematics. \n91.  On information and belief, all schools attended by the individual \nPlaintiffs receive federal funding that is threatened by the DOJ/DOE Title IX \nRule. \n92.  All individual  Plaintiffs are members of North Carolinians for \nPrivacy. \nDEFENDANTS \nDefendant Department of Justice \n93.  Defendant Department of Justice is an executive agency of the \nUnited States government and is responsible for the enforcement of Title IX, \n20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part \n106. DOJ also has authority to bring enforcement actions to enforce Title IX \nand VAWA. \n \n20 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 20 of 69\n\nDefendant Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch \n94.  Defendant  Loretta  E.  Lynch  is  the  United  States  Attorney \nGeneral.  In  this  capacity,  she  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmanagement of the DOJ. Lynch is sued in her official capacity only. \nDefendant Department of Education \n95.   Defendant Department of Education is an executive agency of \nthe  United  States  government  and  is  responsible  for  the  promulgation, \nadministration, and enforcement of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, and its \nimplementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. \n96.  DOE is responsible for adopting, promulgating, and enforcing its \nnew legislative rule interpreting “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender \nidentity.   \nDefendant Secretary John B. King, Jr. \n97.  Defendant John B. King, Jr., is the United States Secretary of \nEducation.  In  this  capacity,  he  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmanagement of the DOE. King is sued in his official capacity only.   \n21 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 21 of 69\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  DOJ  Relies  on  DOE’S  Unlawful  Agency  Action  and \nMisunderstandings of VAWA \n \nA.    Title IX and Its Meaning \n98.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on \nthe basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance…” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. \n99.  The regulations implementing Title IX provide, in relevant part, \nthat “no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any \nacademic, extracurricular … or other education program or activity operated \nby  a  recipient  which  receives  Federal  financial  assistance.”  34  C.F.R.  § \n106.31(a). \n100.  The  implementing  regulations  also  provide  that  a  funding \nrecipient shall not on the basis of sex: “Treat one person differently from \nanother in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or \ncondition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service; … Provide different \naid, benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different \nmanner; … Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service; … Subject any \nperson  to  separate  or  different  rules  of  behavior,  sanctions,  or  other \n22 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 22 of 69\n\ntreatment; … [or] Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, \nprivilege, advantage, or opportunity.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b). \n101.  Nothing  in  Title  IX’s  text,  structure,  legislative  history,  or \naccompanying  regulations  suggests  that  Title  IX  protects  against \ndiscrimination because of one’s professed gender identity. \n102.  The term “gender identity” does not appear in the text of Title IX. \n103.  The term “gender identity” does not appear in the regulations \naccompanying Title IX.  \n104.  The  term  “gender  identity”  does  not  appear  in  the  legislative \nhistory relating to Title IX. \n105.  Indeed,  recognizing  that  Title  IX  does  not  protect  against \ndiscrimination because of “gender identity” (but only against discrimination \nbecause of sex), Senator Al Franken has repeatedly introduced legislation \nmodeled after Title IX that would protect against discrimination because of \ngender identity in the education context, just as Title IX protects against \ndiscrimination because of sex. \n106.  That  legislation  has  failed  to  pass  every  year  it  has  been \nintroduced. \n107.  Title IX and the accompanying regulations use the term “sex,” \nnot “gender identity,” in describing the type of discrimination prohibited.  \n23 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 23 of 69\n\n108.  The  term  “sex”  as  used  in  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulations means male and female, under the traditional binary conception \nof sex.  \n109.  Title  IX  also  states  that  “nothing  contained  herein  shall  be \nconstrued to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this \nAct, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes[,]” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1686, indicating that Congress intended that Title IX would respect \nstudent privacy rights. \n110.  Title IX’s accompanying  regulations  confirm that  schools “may \nprovide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \n[as long as] such facilities provided for students of one sex [are] comparable to \nsuch facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.   \n111.  Preventing  the  mixing  of  males  and  females  in  intimate \nenvironments like restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and changing facilities \nis the very reason that Congress allowed for sex-specific living facilities and \nthat Title IX regulations allow for sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and \nchanging areas. \nB.    DOE’s Unlawful Agency Action \n112.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, any “rules which do not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but \n24 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 24 of 69\n\nwhich establish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must \ncomply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how \nthey initially are labeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n113.  Such  legislative  rules  enacted  under  Title  IX  must  also  be \n“approved by the President” before they become effective. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n114.  DOE took agency action and declared that the term “sex” as used \nin  Title  IX’s  prohibition  on  sex  discrimination  now  means,  or  includes, \n“gender identity.”  \n115.  This agency action constituted the creation of a new legislative \nrule, because it announced a new policy position, which the agency is treating \nas binding. \n116.  DOE  announced  this  new  legislative  rule  redefining  “sex”  to \nschools nationwide in several DOE guidance documents published over the \nlast few years, including the following: U.S. Department of Education, Office \nfor Civil Rights, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence, 5 \n(Apr. 2014); U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Questions \nand Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes \nand Extracurricular Activities, 25 (Dec. 2014); U.S. Department of Education, \nOffice for Civil Rights, Title IX Resource Guide, 1, 15, 16, 19, 21-22 (Apr. \n25 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 25 of 69\n\n2015); U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice, Dear \nColleague Letter (May 13, 2016).  \n117.  DOE’s  new  rule  requires  educational  institutions  to  treat \nstudents consistently with their professed gender identity, regardless of sex.  \n118.  DOE  has  enforced  its  new  rule  in  numerous  secondary  school \ndistricts around the country. \n119.  For example, DOE threatened Palatine, Illinois, Township High \nSchool District 211 with the loss of $6 million dollars in federal funds if it \nfailed to grant a male student who professed a female identity access to the \ngirls’ locker and shower rooms. \n120.  Also,  DOE  has  threatened  Highland  Local  School  District  in \nMorrow County, Ohio with the loss of more than a million dollars in federal \nfunds if it failed to grant a male student who professed a female identity \naccess to girls’ restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight accommodations. \n121.  DOE  has  treated  its  declaration  that  Title  IX  bars  gender \nidentity discrimination as a legislative rule that is binding on all schools that \nare subject to Title IX. \n122.  DOE  is  actively  enforcing  this  legislative  rule  against  schools \nacross the country. \n26 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 26 of 69\n\n123.  DOE  did  not  comply  with  APA’s  notice-and-comment \nrequirements when it adopted its legislative rule redefining “sex” in Title IX \nto mean or include gender identity and mandating that schools give students \nwho profess an opposite sex gender identity access to opposite sex facilities. \n124.  DOE’s new rule was not published for notice and comment. \n125.  DOE’s new rule was not signed by the President. \nC.    DOJ’s  Improper  Reliance  on  DOE’s  Unlawful  Agency \nAction  \n \n126.  On Wednesday, May 4, 2016, the federal Department of Justice \n(DOJ)  sent  a  letter  to  the  Governor  of  the  state  of  North  Carolina  (the \n“Letter to the Governor”)6 and a letter to the President of the University \nof North Carolina System (the “Letter to the University System”).7  \n                                                 \n6 Letter, U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to Governor Pat \nMcCrory,  May  4,  2016,  available  at \nhttps://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2823410/Civil-Rights-Division-\nletter-on-HB2.pdf; Letter, U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to \nMargaret Spellings, President, University of North Carolina, May 4, 2016, \navailable  at  http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/article75647942.ece/BINARY/Read:%20DOJ%20letter%20to%20\nUNC (last visited August 3, 2016). \n7  Letter,  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  Civil  Rights  Division  to  Margaret \nSpellings, President, University of North Carolina, May 4, 2016, available at \nhttp://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/article75647942.ece/BINARY/Read:-\n%20DOJ%20letter%20to%20UNC (last visited August 3, 2016).  \n27 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 27 of 69\n\n127.  Those  letters  stated  that  if  the  State  and  University  System \ncomplied  with  a  North  Carolina  law  known  as  H.B.  2,  which  requires \nmultiple occupancy restrooms or changing facilities to be designated for the \nuse of only students of one sex, the State would violate Title VII, and the \nUniversity System would violate Title VII, Title IX, and VAWA.   \n128.  Those letters also include a demand: stop enforcing H.B. 2 or face \nimminent  enforcement  actions,  including  a  revocation  of  their  federal \nfunding. \n129.  DOJ’s lawsuit, filed against the State and the University System, \namplified that demand.  \n130.  The  letters  and  the  lawsuit  together  create  an  unmistakable \nultimatum: either submit to the will of Defendants by prohibiting sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities in educational institutions, \nor  face  the  consequences,  including  revocation  of  federal  funds  (“the \nUltimatum”). \n131.  The Letter to the Governor notes in footnote 3 that H.B. 2 applies \nto  local  boards  of  education,  thus  recognizing  that  public  schools  are \nprohibited  by  state  law  from  allowing  males  to  enter  and  use  restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities designated for females, and vice versa. \n28 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 28 of 69\n\n132.  The Letter to the Governor states that a similar provision in H.B. \n2,  which  affects  the  University  of  North  Carolina  System,  is  a  Title  IX \nviolation. Id. at 2-3. \n133.  The Letter to the Governor also warns that, according to DOE’s \nguidance,  “educational  institutions  generally  must  treat  [students  who \nprofess  an  opposite  sex  gender  identity]  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity,” and that DOE’s guidance is “entitled to controlling weight.” Id. at 1-\n2 (quotations omitted). \n134.  The Letter to the University System states that the requirements \nof Title IX and its implementing regulations prohibit the University System \nfrom maintaining sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, or changing facilities \nfor either employees or students. Letter to the University System, supra note \n7, at 2-3. \n135.  As  authority  for  this  statement,  DOJ  relies  upon  DOE’s  new \nlegislative rule declaring that the term “sex” in Title IX and its implementing \nregulations includes gender identity. Id. at 3.  \n136.  DOJ thus relies upon DOE’s unlawful agency action to reach its \ndetermination that the State and the University System will violate Title IX \nif they adhere to the requirements of H.B. 2 and continue to maintain sex-\n29 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 29 of 69\n\nspecific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  in  the  State’s \neducational institutions, including the University System. \nD.    DOJ’s Reliance on a Wrong Understanding of VAWA \n137.  In the Letter to the University System, DOJ states that VAWA \nprohibits  the  University  System  from  discriminating  based  on  gender \nidentity,  and  intimates  that  VAWA  therefore  prohibits  schools  from \nmaintaining sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities. Id. \nat 2. \n138.  VAWA  requires  that  no  one,  based  on  gender  identity,  “be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with \nfunds  made  available  under  the  [VAWA].”  42  U.S.C.A.  §  13925(b)(13)(A) \n(emphasis added). \n139.  The  programs  and  activities  funded  under  VAWA  include,  for \nexample, “education programs for the prevention of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking,” “programs providing legal, medical, or \npsychological  counseling,  for  victims  of  domestic  violence,  dating  violence, \nsexual  assault,  and  stalking,”  the  creation  of  “data  collection  and \ncommunication  systems  .  .  .  linking  campus  security  to  the  local  law \nenforcement,” and the distribution of “print or electronic materials to address \n30 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 30 of 69\n\nboth prevention and intervention in domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nviolence, and stalking.” 42 U.S.C. § 14045b(b). \n140.  VAWA funding does not include policies or programs regulating \naccess to restrooms, locker rooms, or changing facilities. \n141.  DOJ’s  Letter  to  the  University  System  indicates  that  DOJ \nbelieves that VAWA prohibits the University System and other educational \ninstitutions  from  maintaining  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and \nchanging facilities. Letter to the University System, supra note 7, at 2.   \n142.  VAWA  does  not  prohibit  schools  from  maintaining  sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities. \nII.   The Harm to Plaintiff North Carolinians for Privacy’s Members \nand the Individual Plaintiffs as a Result of DOJ’s Letters \n \nA.   The Harm to the University Students and Victims of Sex \nAssault \n \n143.  The  DOJ’s  threatened  enforcement  action,  which  has  already \ncommenced  and  includes  an  imminent  threat  to  revoke  the  University \nSystem’s $1.4 billion in federal funding, places the University Students at \nimmediate risk of suffering the loss of educational opportunity as a result of \ndecreased funding to the University System. \n31 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 31 of 69\n\n144.  The loss of such a substantial amount of money would result in \nsevere cutbacks in educational programs from which the University Students \ndirectly benefit. \n145.  This will directly harm the University Students.   \n146.  Further, some of the University Students receive federal financial \naid.   \n147.  These  University  Students  rely  on  that  federal  financial \nassistance to attend schools in the University System.   \n148.  If  DOJ  revokes  the  University  System’s  eligibility  for  federal \nfunding,  the  University  Students  will  no  longer  be  eligible  for  federal \nfinancial assistance. \n149.  Federal  financial  assistance  under  Title  IX  includes  federal \ngrants,  loans,  scholarships,  and  wages  that  are  “authorized  or  extended \nunder  a  law  administered  by  the  Federal  agency  that  awards  such \nassistance.” See 65 Fed. Reg. 52858; see also Grove City College v. Bell, 465 \nU.S. 555, 569 (1984) (noting that enforcement action by the DOE against a \ncollege for failure to certify compliance with Title IX would leave students \nreceiving  federal  financial  assistance  the  choice  of  switching  colleges  or \nforegoing the assistance).   \n32 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 32 of 69\n\n150.  If the DOJ follows through on its threat to imminently revoke \nfederal funding from the University System due to a Title IX violation, that \nrevocation would also bar students from using federal scholarships, loans, \ngrants, and wages to pay for tuition to attend a college within the System. \n151.  Students  affected  by  a  revocation  of  the  University  System’s \nfederal funding would have their expenditures related to their college costs \nincrease dramatically, forcing them to pay far more to attend a college within \nthe System, transfer to a school outside the System, or drop out of school \naltogether.    \n152.  The  University  System’s  colleges  provide  one  of  the  highest \nquality college educations available in North Carolina. \n153.  If the University Students are barred from using federal funds to \nattend any college within the University System, they will have to attend \ncolleges that do not offer the same high quality educational opportunities, \nclasses, programs, and degrees as their current schools.  \n154.  If the University System capitulates to Defendants’ threats, the \nUniversity  Students  will  suffer  the  loss  of  their  constitutional  right  to \nprivacy, because they will be compelled by the government to use restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities with members of the opposite sex.  \n33 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 33 of 69\n\n155.  The  female  University  Students  in  particular  object  to  the \nprivacy violations created by allowing males the right of entry and use of \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities designated for females. \n156.  But the female University Students experience the added worry, \nanxiety, stress, and fear caused by the knowledge that allowing males the \nright of entry and  use of restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities \ndesignated for females places them at higher risk of sexual assault. \n157.  The  federal  Center  for  Disease  Control  reports  that  “[i]n  a \nnationally representative survey of adults, 37.4% of female rape victims were \nfirst raped between ages 18-24.” Center for Disease Control, Sexual Violence: \nFacts at a Glance (2012), available at   \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf  (last  visited \nAugust 3, 2016). \n158.  The federal Center for Disease Control reports that, in a study \nlimited  to  undergraduate  college  women,  19%  experienced  attempted  or \ncompleted sexual assault since entering college.” Id. (emphasis added). \n159.  The  President  of  the  United  States  has  stated  that  “[a]n \nestimated one in five women has been sexually assaulted during her college \nyears.”    The  White  House,  “President  Obama  Launches  the  ‘It’s  On  Us’ \nCampaign to End Sexual Assault on Campus,” September 19, 2014, available \n34 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 34 of 69\n\nat https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/19/president-obama-launches-its-\nus-campaign-end-sexual-assault-campus (last visited August 3, 2016). \n160.  The incidence of rape and other forms of sexual assault on college \ncampuses  may  be  even  higher,  because  the  President  said  that  “only  12 \npercent [of sexual assaults] are reported.” Id. \n161.  Currently,  if  someone  sees  a  male  student  enter  the  female \nstudents’ private facilities, he or she can notify campus security. \n162.  But if Defendants have their way, no one will be able to stop any \nmale from entering female restrooms and locker rooms. \n163.  Significantly,  Defendants’  understanding  of  Title  IX  does  not \ninclude  a  “gender  expression”  component,  but  only  a  “gender  identity” \ncomponent. \n164.  So, according to DOJ and DOE, males do not need to present as \nfemale in order to enter and use female restrooms and locker rooms; rather, \nthey merely must say that they identify as female. \n165.  The female University Students are deeply concerned that male \nstudents  whose  gender  identity  matches  their  male  biology  might  take \nadvantage of such policies for nefarious and lewd purposes.  \n35 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 35 of 69\n\n166.  The  female  University  Students  are  deeply  concerned  that \nallowing male students into their private facilities increases the likelihood \nthat they will be assaulted or otherwise victimized. \n167.  Past  and  future  victims  of  sex  assault  are  harmed  by  the \nultimatum to either open facilities based on gender identity or forgo VAWA \nfunding that was intended to assist victims and prevent future abuse. \n168.  Additionally,  some  of  the  University  Students  object  to  using \nrestrooms and locker rooms with members of the opposite sex because of their \nsincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \nB.  The Harm to the Minor Students and their Parents \n169.  The Minor Students, including the Minor Student members of \nNorth Carolinians for Privacy and the individual Plaintiffs, all attend schools \nin North Carolina that receive federal funds pursuant to Title IX. \n170.  Their  schools,  like  all  schools  receiving  federal  funds,  rely  on \nthose funds to provide numerous educational programs and activities. \n171.  The  DOJ  and  DOE  are  authorized  to  revoke  federal  funds  of \nschools found to be in violation of Title IX. \n172.  If the Minor Students’ schools lose their federal funds, the Minor \nStudents will suffer the harm of fewer, or inferior, educational programs and \nactivities.  \n36 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 36 of 69\n\n173.  Additionally,  if  the  Minor  Students’  schools  capitulate  to \nDefendants’  threats,  the  Minor  Students  will  suffer  the  loss  of  their \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy,  because  they  will  be  compelled  by  the \ngovernment  to  use  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  with \nmembers of the opposite sex. \n174.  The Minor Students’ Parents desire for their minor children to \nreceive a high-quality public education.   \n175.  If the Minor Students’ schools lose their federal funds, the Minor \nStudents will suffer the harm of fewer, or inferior, educational programs and \nactivities, and the Parents’ desire for their minor children to receive a high-\nquality public education will be frustrated.  \n176.  If the Minor Students’ schools capitulate to Defendants’ threats, \neach Parent’s right to direct the education and upbringing of their children—\nincluding  their  right  to  control  whether  their  children  will  be  exposed  to \npeople of the opposite sex in intimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, \nlocker rooms, showers, and other changing facilities—will be violated because \ntheir minor children will be compelled by the government to use restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities with members of the opposite sex.  \n177.  All of the Parents object to their children, the Minor Students, \nusing  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  with  opposite-sex \n37 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 37 of 69\n\nstudents, enduring the risk of exposure to opposite-sex nudity, and enduring \nthe risk of exposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to \nmembers of the opposite sex. \n178.  Additionally, some of the Minor Students and Parents object to \nthe Minor Students using restrooms and locker rooms with members of the \nopposite  sex  because  of  their  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  regarding \nmodesty and nudity. \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \n179.  If  DOJ  is  allowed  to  forbid  the  State  from  maintaining  sex-\nspecific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities on its campuses, the \nUniversity Students will either (1) suffer the loss of their constitutionally-\nguaranteed  right  to  bodily  privacy,  or  (2)  suffer  the  loss  of  educational \nopportunities and their ability to access federal financial assistance, because \nthe University System refuses to comply with DOJ’s Ultimatum, and their \nschools’ federal funds are revoked by the federal government. \n180.  If  DOJ  is  allowed  to  forbid  the  State  from  maintaining  sex-\nspecific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities in its local school \ndistricts,  the  Minor  Students  will  either  (1)  suffer  the  loss  of  their \nconstitutionally-guaranteed right to bodily privacy, or (2) suffer the loss of \neducational opportunities because the State refuses to comply with DOJ’s \n38 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 38 of 69\n\nUltimatum,  and  their  schools’  federal  funds  are  revoked  by  the  federal \ngovernment.   \n181.  If  DOJ  is  allowed  to  forbid  the  State  from  maintaining  sex-\nspecific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  in  local  school \ndistricts, the Parents will either (1) suffer the loss of their constitutionally-\nguaranteed  right  to  direct  the  education  and  upbringing  of  their  minor \nchildren, or (2) suffer the loss of educational opportunities for their children, \nbecause the State refuses to comply with DOJ’s Ultimatum, and their schools’ \nfederal funds are revoked by the federal government. \n182.  The  University  Students,  Minor  Students,  and  their  Parents \nshould not be forced to suffer any of these results, because providing single-\nsex restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, and changing facilities does not \nviolate Title IX or VAWA, as DOJ’s Ultimatum claims. \n183.  Plaintiffs need a declaration and injunction from this Court to \npreserve their rights.   \n184.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 39 of 69\n\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATION THAT DOJ AND DOE CANNOT RELY UPON \nDOE’S REDEFINION OF “SEX” IN TITLE IX BECAUSE THE \nREDEFINITION VIOLATES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT \n185.   Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through \n184 and incorporate them herein. \n186.  DOE promulgated, and is enforcing, a new legislative rule that \nredefines  the  term  “sex”  in  Title  IX  and  its  accompanying  regulations  to \nmean, or at least include, “gender identity.” \n187.  Pursuant to Executive Order 12250, the DOJ also has authority \nto bring enforcement actions to enforce Title IX. \n188.  DOJ’s enforcement of Title IX is reviewable pursuant to 20 U.S.C \n§ 1683.  \n189.  Threatened adverse action pursuant to Title IX constitutes final, \nreviewable action. \n190.  DOJ’s letters, along with its lawsuit and the Attorney General’s \ncomments at her press conference, all threaten revocation of Title IX funding. \n191.  Such threats of funding revocation are final, reviewable agency \naction. \n192.  DOJ relied upon DOE’s new rule redefining “sex” and, with its \nUltimatum,  is  enforcing  that  rule  against  the  State  and  the  University \n40 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 40 of 69\n\nSystem, and so against the University Students and the Minor Students and \ntheir Parents. \n193.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  declares  that  Title  IX  requires  educational \ninstitutions to permit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and \nchanging facilities based on their professed gender identity, which is both \nsubjective and unverifiable. \n194.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  declares  that  Title  IX  prohibits  educational \ninstitutions  from  maintaining  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and \nchanging facilities. \n195.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  if  allowed  to  stand,  would  also  prohibit \neducational institutions from maintaining sex-specific living facilities, which \nTitle IX specifically authorizes. 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n196.  DOJ’s reliance upon DOE’s new rule is misplaced. \n197.  DOE’s new rule redefining “sex” in Title IX contradicts the text, \nstructure, legislative history, and historical judicial interpretation of Title IX, \nall of which confirm that  the term,  “sex,” means male  and female in the \nbinary sense. \n198.  According  to  DOE’s  new  legislative  rule,  Title  IX  requires \neducational institutions to permit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, \nshowers, and changing facilities based on their professed gender identity. \n41 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 41 of 69\n\n199.  According  to  DOE’s  new  legislative  rule,  Title  IX  prohibits \neducational  institutions  from  maintaining  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker \nrooms, and changing facilities. \n200.  DOE  has  communicated  this  new  legislative  rule  to  school \ndistricts and colleges nationwide and stated that their failure to comply with \nit will result in investigation and enforcement action up to and including \nwithdrawal of billions of dollars in federal funding. \n201.  DOE’s promulgation and enforcement of this new legislative rule, \nwhich  DOJ  relies  upon,  are  likewise  reviewable  actions  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \n202.  DOJ cannot rely upon DOE’s new rule, and enforce it against the \nState and University, if DOE’s new rule violates the APA and so is unlawful. \n203.  DOE’s  agency  actions,  including  the  creation  of  rules,  are \nreviewable pursuant to 20 U.S.C § 1683. \n204.  DOE’s new rule is a final, reviewable agency action, and there is \nno  other  adequate  remedy,  because  DOJ  now  relies  upon  that  rule  to \nthreaten  the  State  and  University  System,  which  causes  harm  to  the \nUniversity Students, Minor Students, and Parents.   \n205.  Plaintiffs  cannot  obtain  relief  unless  this  Court  declares  that \nDOE’s actions are unlawful so that DOJ cannot rely upon them. \n42 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 42 of 69\n\n206.  The members of North Carolinians for Privacy, which include the \nindividual Plaintiffs, have suffered a legal wrong as a direct result of the \nDOE’s agency action, upon which DOJ relies, because North Carolinians for \nPrivacy’s members’ constitutional and statutory rights will be violated if the \nState and University System submit to DOJ’s improper demand.   \n207.  Under the APA, a reviewing Court must “hold unlawful and set \naside agency action” in four instances that apply to this case:  \n  One: if the agency action is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);  \n  Two: if the agency action is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);  \n  Three: if the agency action is “contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); and  \n  Four: if the agency action is “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n208.  DOE’s  promulgation  of  its  new  rule,  upon  which  DOJ  relies, \nviolates all four of these standards and so should be held unlawful and set \naside. \n43 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 43 of 69\n\nI.    DOE’s  Action  Is  Unlawful  Under  the  APA  Because  It  Is  In \nExcess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations \n \n209.  DOE’s actions in promulgating and enforcing its new rule are “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright,” because they redefine Title IX’s unambiguous term “sex” to mean or \ninclude gender identity without Congress’s authorization. \n210.  Congress has not delegated to DOE the authority to define, or \nredefine, unambiguous terms in Title IX. \n211.  Title IX, passed in 1972, states that “[n]o person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination…”    20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a) \n(emphasis added). \n212.  The term “sex” as used in Title IX means male and female, under \nthe traditional binary conception of sex.  \n213.  This definition is not ambiguous. \n214.  Title IX makes no reference to “gender identity” in the language \nof the statute. \n215.  The  enacting  regulations,  which  interpret  Title  IX  and  were \npromulgated in 1975, likewise make no reference to “gender identity.”   \n216.  The legislative history of Title IX makes no reference to “gender \nidentity.”  \n44 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 44 of 69\n\n217.  Title IX’s implementing regulations are not ambiguous in their \ninstruction that a school district may separate restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex. \n218.  Title IX permits schools receiving federal funds to “maintain[] \nseparate living facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n219.  The  regulations  implementing  Title  IX  state  that  schools \nreceiving  federal  funding  “may  provide  separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for \nstudents of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities provided for students of \nthe other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.   \n220.  Title  IX  does  not  require  the  University  System,  or  the  other \nschools within the State, to open sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, shower \nrooms, and changing facilities to members of the opposite sex.  \n221.  DOE’s unilateral decree that “sex” in Title IX means or includes \n“gender identity,” which requires schools to allow males who profess a female \ngender identity to use the women’s facilities, and vice versa, is not supported \nby Title IX’s text, implementing regulations, or legislative history.   \n222.  The  new  rule  is  contradicted  by  the  fact  that  every  court  to \nconsider the question for the past four decades, prior to the DOE’s April 2015 \nGuidance  Document  equating  sex  discrimination  with  gender  identity \n45 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 45 of 69\n\ndiscrimination,  had  concluded  that  Title  IX  did  not  require  cross-sex \nrestrooms,  locker  rooms,  or  changing  facilities,  even  when  students  who \nprofess an opposite sex gender identity are involved.  \n223.  The  new  rule  is  contradicted  by  the  fact  that  Congress  has \nconsidered proposed legislation that would add Title IX style protections for \ngender identity discrimination, but has repeatedly and consistently declined \nto enact it. \n224.  Therefore,  the  DOE’s  rule  was  promulgated  and  enforced  “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations, or short of statutory \nright[,]” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). This Court should hold that it is unlawful \nand set it aside.  \n225.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were \ninterpretive, instead of legislative, because it violates the Constitution and \nfederal statutes, and is also plainly erroneous and inconsistent with Title IX \nitself.   \nII.  DOE’s  Action  Is  Unlawful  Under  the  APA  Because  It  Is \nArbitrary,  Capricious,  An  Abuse  of  Discretion,  or  Not  In \nAccordance With Law \n \n226.  DOE’s actions in promulgating and enforcing  its new rule are \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n46 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 46 of 69\n\n227.  Congress requires that whenever an agency takes action it do so \nafter engaging in a process by which it “examine[s] the relevant data and \narticulate[s]  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  its  action  including  a  rational \nconnection  between  the  facts  found  and  the  choice  made.”  Motor  Vehicle. \nMfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation \nomitted). \n228.  An agency action is “arbitrary and capricious if the agency has \nrelied on factors which Congress has  not intended it to  consider, entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation \nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or product of \nagency expertise.” Id. \n229.  DOE gave no explanation whatsoever for its redefinition of “sex” \nin Title IX, whereby DOE unilaterally decreed that the term, “sex,” in Title \nIX includes gender identity.   \n230.  Nor did DOE give any explanation of the relevant factors that \nwere the basis of its actions. \n231.  DOE failed to consider important aspects of the problems caused \nby mixing boys and girls in intimate settings, including the language and \nstructure  of  Title  IX  and  its  regulations;  the  congressional,  and  judicial \n47 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 47 of 69\n\nhistories  of  Title  IX  and  its  regulations;  the  practical  and  constitutional \nharms created by its unlawful application of Title IX; and the violation of \nTitle IX caused by this unlawful application. \n232.  DOE’s action was also made without a rational explanation.  \n233.  It  departed  from  the  established  Title  IX  policy  that  allowed \nschools  to  maintain  private  facilities  separated  by  sex;  and,  it  rested  on \nconsiderations  related  to  “gender  identity,”  despite  the  fact  that  the \nlegislative history indicates Congress did not intend “sex” to mean anything \nother than objective binary sex. \n234.  DOE’s action was also made even though it is contrary to law or \nregulation.  \n235.  DOE’s rule purporting to redefine Title IX violates Title IX as it \napplies to the very group Title IX was created to protect, female students, by \ncreating a hostile environment for them. \n236.  DOE’s rule is thus contrary to Title IX. \n237.  DOE’s  new  rule  is  also  contrary  to  the  Religious  Freedom \nRestoration Act (“RFRA”), codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb et seq. \n238.  Some of the University Students object to using restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities with members of the opposite sex because of \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n48 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 48 of 69\n\n239.  Some  of  the  Minor  Students  and  Parents,  including  the \nindividual Plaintiffs, object to the Minor Students using restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities designated for members of the opposite sex \nbecause  of  their  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  regarding  modesty  and \nnudity. \n240.  Allowing students to enter and use restrooms, locker rooms, and \nchanging  facilities  designated  for  members  of  the  opposite  sex  will \nsubstantially burden these sincerely held religious beliefs. \n241.  RFRA does not allow the government to substantially burden free \nexercise  of  religion  unless  the  regulation  satisfies  strict  scrutiny  review, \nwhich requires that the government demonstrate that the law or regulation \nfurthers a compelling interest in the least restrictive means available. \n242.  DOJ and DOE have no compelling interest to justify forcing the \nUniversity  Students  and  the  Minor  Students  to  share  restrooms,  locker \nrooms, and changing facilities with people of the opposite sex.  \n243.  Also, DOJ and DOE have not used the least restrictive means of \nserving any interest they may have. \n244.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  which,  if \nimplemented,  would  prohibit  the  University  System  and  those  schools \nmaintained by the State and its political subdivisions from retaining their \n49 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 49 of 69\n\nsex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities,  fails  the \nrequired strict scrutiny review and is unlawful under, and contrary to, RFRA.  \n245.  DOE’s promulgation and enforcement of its rule is thus arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law. This Court \nshould therefore hold that it is unlawful and set it aside.  \n246.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were \ninterpretive,  instead  of  legislative,  because  it  would  still  be  arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, and so is \ndue to be declared unlawful and set aside. \nIII.  DOE’s  Action  Is  Unlawful  Under  the  APA  Because  It  Is \nContrary  to  Constitutional  Right,  Power,  Privilege,  or \nImmunity \n \n247.  DOE’s  actions  are  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power, \nprivilege, or immunity.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n248.  DOE’s  legislative  rule  is  an  unlawful  application  of  Title  IX \ncontrary  to  the  Constitution  because  it  violates  numerous  constitutional \nrights of the members of North Carolinians for Privacy and the individual \nPlaintiffs,  including  the  fundamental  right  to  privacy,  the  fundamental \nliberty interest in directing the education and upbringing of one’s children, \nand the First Amendment’s guarantee of free exercise of religion.   \n \n50 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 50 of 69\n\nA.   Privacy Rights Are Violated \n249.  There is a fundamental constitutional right to bodily privacy in \none’s fully or partially unclothed body. \n250.  This fundamental right also includes the right to be free from \nState-compelled risk of intimate exposure of oneself to people of the opposite \nsex. \n251.  The  right  to  be  free  from  State-compelled  risk  of  intimate \nexposure of oneself to people of the opposite sex, while part of the right to \nbodily privacy, is also separately and deeply rooted in this Nation’s history \nand tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and so is itself a \nfundamental constitutional right. \n252.  Allowing  opposite-sex  students  right  of  entry  and  use  of \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities will infringe the University \nStudents’  and  the  Minor  Students’  fundamental  right  to  privacy  in  their \nunclothed  bodies,  as  well  as  their  fundamental  right  to  be  free  from \ngovernment-compelled risk of intimate exposure to the opposite sex, without \nany compelling justification.  \n253.  The government may not infringe fundamental rights, unless the \ninfringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires the government \n51 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 51 of 69\n\nto demonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling interest in \nthe least restrictive means available. \n254.  DOJ and DOE have no compelling interest to justify forcing the \nUniversity  Students  and  the  Minor  Students  to  share  restrooms,  locker \nrooms, and changing facilities with people of the opposite sex.  \n255.  Also, DOJ and DOE have not used the least restrictive means of \nserving any interest they may have. \n256.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  which \nthreaten the University System and schools maintained by the State and its \npolitical  subdivisions  with  enforcement  actions  to  revoke  their  federal \nfunding  if  they  retain  their  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and \nchanging facilities, fail strict scrutiny review and are unconstitutional.  \nB.  Fundamental Parental Rights Are Violated \n257.  The  right  of  parents  to  make  decisions  concerning  the  care, \ncustody, and control of their children is a fundamental right protected by the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n258.  Included within that parental fundamental right is the power to \ndirect the education and upbringing of one’s children. \n259.  This fundamental right gives parents the freedom, as well as the \nduty, to instill moral standards and values in their minor children. \n52 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 52 of 69\n\n260.  This  fundamental  right  encompasses  the  right  to  determine \nwhether, and when, their minor children endure the risk of being in intimate, \nvulnerable  settings  like  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  showers,  and  changing \nfacilities with members of the opposite sex. \n261.  It also encompasses the right to determine whether their children \nwill have to risk being exposed to opposite sex nudity at school and whether \ntheir children, while at school, will have to risk exposing their own undressed \nor partially unclothed bodies to members of the opposite sex. \n262.  All of the Parents object to their children, the Minor Students, \nusing  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  with  opposite-sex \nstudents, enduring the risk of exposure to opposite-sex nudity, and enduring \nthe risk of exposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to \nmembers of the opposite sex. \n263.  Allowing  opposite-sex  students  right  of  entry  and  use  of \nrestrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  will  infringe  this \nfundamental parental right. \n264.  Defendants  may  not  infringe  fundamental  rights,  including \nparents’ fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their \nchildren, unless the infringement satisfies strict scrutiny review. \n53 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 53 of 69\n\n265.  Defendants have no compelling interest to justify forcing school \nchildren to share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates. \n266.  Also,  Defendants  have  not  used  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nserving any interest they may have. \n267.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  which \nthreatens schools maintained by the State and its political subdivisions with \nenforcement actions to revoke their federal funding if they retain their sex-\nspecific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities, fails the required \nstrict scrutiny review and is unconstitutional. \nC.  Free Exercise Rights Are Violated. \n268.  The First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law \nrespecting  an  establishment  of  religion,  or  prohibiting  the  free  exercise \nthereof. \n269.  Some of the University Students object to using restrooms, locker \nrooms, and changing facilities with members of the opposite sex because of \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n270.  Some  of  the  Minor  Students  and  Parents  object  to  the  Minor \nStudents  using  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  with \nmembers of the opposite sex because of their sincerely held religious beliefs \nregarding modesty and nudity. \n54 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 54 of 69\n\n271.  Allowing students to enter and use restrooms, locker rooms, and \nchanging facilities designed for the opposite sex will infringe the free exercise \nrights of these University Students, Minor Students, and their Parents. \n272.  Laws that burden free exercise, but are not neutral or generally \napplicable, are subject to strict scrutiny.   \n273.  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  are  not  generally \napplicable. \n274.  Because DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum are not generally \napplicable, their actions are subject to strict scrutiny. \n275.  Additionally, DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum are subject \nto strict scrutiny because, in addition to burdening free exercise rights, they \nalso burden other constitutional rights.  \n276.  Defendants have no compelling interest to justify forcing school \nchildren  to  share  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing  facilities  with \nopposite sex classmates. \n277.  Also,  Defendants  have  not  used  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nserving any interest they may have. \n278.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  which \nthreaten schools maintained by the State and its political subdivisions with \nenforcement actions to revoke their federal funding if they retain their sex-\n55 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 55 of 69\n\nspecific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities fail scrutiny review \nand are unconstitutional. \nD.  Spending Clause Requirements Are Violated \n279.  Also, DOE’s legislative rule is in violation of the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution, under which Title IX was enacted.  \n280.  When  Congress  uses  its  Spending  Clause  power,  it  generates \nlegislation much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the \nStates agree to comply with federally imposed conditions. \n281.  Congress must clearly and unambiguously state the conditions to \nwhich  the  States  are  agreeing  in  exchange  for  federal  funds,  so  that  the \nStates can knowingly decide whether to accept the funding. \n282.  The crucial inquiry is whether Congress spoke so clearly that it \ncan be fairly said that the State could make an informed choice. \n283.  Requiring  educational  institutions  to  allow  males  access  to \nfacilities designated for  females  cannot pass this  test, no matter how the \nmales identify.  \n284.  Requiring  educational  institutions  to  allow  females  access  to \nfacilities  designated  for  males  cannot  pass  this  test,  no  matter  how  the \nfemales identify.  \n56 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 56 of 69\n\n285.  As already explained, the plain language of the text, along with \nthe legislative history, clearly indicates that Congress intended that (1) “sex” \nmeans objective binary sex; (2) Title IX prevents discrimination based on sex; \nand  (3) Title  IX  allows  sex-specific  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  living \nfacilities. \n286.  Further, the implementing regulations specifically allow schools \nto maintain sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities. \n287.  Thus, for the over 40 years of Title IX’s existence, it has been \nuniversally understood by schools that receive federal education funding that \nTitle IX’s definition of “sex” does not mean or include gender identity. \n288.  It  has  likewise  been  universally  understood  by  schools  that \nreceived  federal  education  funding  that  maintaining  separate  restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities on the basis of sex is consistent with \nTitle IX. \n289.  No school could have possibly made an informed choice to accept \nfederal funding because no school could have known that the funds it agreed \nto  accept  were  conditioned  on  allowing  cross-sex  private  facilities,  or \notherwise recognizing gender identity as encompassed within the meaning of \n“sex.” \n57 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 57 of 69\n\n290.  For these reasons, this Court should conclude that DOE’s actions \nare unlawful, set aside its Title IX rule, and enjoin Defendants from further \ncommunicating or enforcing the rule that “sex” in Title IX includes “gender \nidentity.”   \n291.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were \ninterpretive,  instead  of  legislative,  because  it  would  still  be  contrary  to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity,  and  so  is  due  to  be \ndeclared unlawful and set aside. \nIV.  DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Without \nObservance of Procedure Required By Law \n \n292.  DOE’s  actions  were  done  “without  observance  of  procedure \nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n293.  As  explained  above,  DOE  has  promulgated  a  new  rule, \nunilaterally declaring that Title IX’s term “sex” includes “gender identity” \nand that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. \n294.  DOE’s  new  rule,  as  enforced  by  DOJ,  also  requires  schools, \nincluding the University System and those schools maintained by the State \nand its political subdivisions, to allow males entry and usage of restrooms \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities designated for females, and vice versa. \n295.  Further, DOJ has given this rule the full force of law, enforcing it \nagainst the University System and the State.  \n58 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 58 of 69\n\n296.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, any “rules which do not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but \nwhich establish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must \ncomply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how \nthey initially are labeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n297.  The  Supreme  Court  has  additionally  ruled  that  all  legislative \nrules, which are those having the force and effect of law and are accorded \nweight in agency adjudicatory processes, must  go through the notice-and-\ncomment requirements. Perez v. Mort. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1204 \n(2015). \n298.  Notice-and-comment rulemaking requires that the DOE (1) issue \na  general  notice  to  the  public  of  the  proposed  rule-making,  typically  by \npublishing  notice  in  the  Federal  Register;  (2)  give  interested  parties  an \nopportunity to submit written  data, views, or arguments on the proposed \nrule,  and  consider  and  respond  to  significant  comments  received;  and  (3) \ninclude in the promulgation of the final rule a concise general statement of \nthe rule’s basis and purpose. \n299.  Notice-and-comment  rulemaking  also  requires  that  the  DOE \nconsider all the relevant comments offered during the public comment period \nbefore finally deciding whether to adopt the proposed rule. \n59 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 59 of 69\n\n300.  Additionally, under Title IX, final rules, regulations, and orders \nof general applicability issued by DOE must be approved by the President of \nthe United States.  \n301.  DOE promulgated and enforced its new rule redefining “sex” in \nTitle IX to include gender identity without notice and comment as required \nby  law.  5  U.S.C.  §  553.  It  promulgated  this  new  legislative  rule  without \nsignature by the President as required by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n302.  Simply stated, DOE did not follow the required procedure when it \nadopted its new rule defining “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender \nidentity.   \n303.  Because DOE’s rule violates the APA, this Court should declare \nthat DOJ cannot lawfully rely upon it as authority for the meaning of “sex” in \nTitle IX.   \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  pray  that  the  Court  grant  the \nrelief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATION THAT MAINTAINING SEX-SPECIFIC \nRESTROOMS, LOCKER ROOMS, AND CHANGING FACILITIES \nDOES NOT VIOLATE TITLE IX \n304.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through \n303 and incorporate them herein. \n60 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 60 of 69\n\n305.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on \nthe basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n306.  Title  IX  itself  refers  to  “both  sexes,”  indicating  binary  sex.  20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(2). \n307.  Title IX also refers to “one sex” and “the other sex,” indicating \nbinary sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8). \n308.  Title  IX  explicitly  allows  educational  institutions  to  maintain \n“separate living facilities for the different sexes,” indicating binary sex. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1686. \n309.  Title IX’s implementing regulations, found at 34 C.F.R. Part 106, \ncontain many similar, “one sex . . . the other sex” statements, each referring \nto binary sex. \n310.  Title IX’s implementing regulations explicitly allow sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.   \n311.  The implementing regulations state that educational institutions \nmay,  consistent  with  Title  IX,  “provide  separate  toilet,  locker  room,  and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for \n61 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 61 of 69\n\nstudents of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities provided for students of \nthe other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added). \n312.  “[O]ne sex” and “the other sex” in 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 refers to \nbinary sex. \n313.  Accordingly, DOJ’s Ultimatum, which threatens the University \nSystem and schools maintained by the State and its political subdivisions \nwith imminent loss of their federal funding if they retain their sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities, violates the guarantees of \nTitle IX.  \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  pray  that  the  Court  grant  the \nrelief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION  \nDECLARATION THAT DOJ’S RELIANCE ON VAWA \nAS AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ITS ULTIMATUM AND \nVIOLATE PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS IS MISPLACED \n \n314.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through \n313 and incorporate them herein. \n315.  DOJ states in its Letter to the University System that VAWA \nrequires  the  University  System  to  allow  males  right  of  entry  and  use  of \nfacilities designated for females, and vice versa. \n316.  VAWA requires nothing of the sort. \n62 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 62 of 69\n\n317.  VAWA requires that no one “be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity  funded  in  whole  or  in  part  with  funds  made  available  under  the \n[VAWA].” 42 U.S.C.A. § 13925(b)(13)(A) (emphasis added). \n318.  The  programs  and  activities  funded  under  VAWA  include,  for \nexample, “education programs for the prevention of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking,” “programs providing legal, medical, or \npsychological  counseling,  for  victims  of  domestic  violence,  dating  violence, \nsexual  assault,  and  stalking,”  the  creation  of  “data  collection  and \ncommunication  systems  .  .  .  linking  campus  security  to  the  local  law \nenforcement, and the distribution of “print or electronic materials to address \nboth prevention and intervention in domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nviolence, and stalking.” 42 U.S.C. § 14045b(b). \n319.  VAWA funding does not specifically include policies or programs \nregulating access to restrooms, locker rooms, or changing facilities.  \n320.  Thus,  VAWA  is  inapposite,  and  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  it  for  its \nUltimatum is misplaced. \n321.  Additionally, similar to Title IX, VAWA has an express carve-out \nfor “sex segregation” and “sex-specific programming” that “is necessary to the \nessential operation of a program.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 13925(b)(13)(B). \n63 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 63 of 69\n\n322.  The statute provides in relevant part: “If sex segregation or sex-\nspecific programming is necessary to the essential operation of a program, \nnothing in this paragraph shall prevent any such program or activity from \nconsideration of an individual’s sex.” Id. It continues: “In such circumstances, \ngrantees  may  meet  the  requirements  of  this  paragraph  by  providing \ncomparable  services  to  individuals  who  cannot  be  provided  with  the  sex-\nsegregated or sex-specific programming.” Id. \n323.  Because  of  constitutional  privacy  and  free  exercise  concerns, \nseparation by sex is “necessary to the essential operation” of schools’ sex-\nspecific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.   \n324.  Because of statutory Title IX and RFRA concerns, separation by \nsex is “necessary to the essential operation” of schools’ sex-specific restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities.    \n325.  Because of safety concerns, separation by sex is “necessary to the \nessential  operation”  of  schools’  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing \nfacilities.   \n326.  These  concerns  apply  to  schools  within  the  University  System \nand other schools operated by the State and its political subdivisions. \n327.  Because separation by sex is necessary to the essential operation \nof schools’ sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities, and \n64 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 64 of 69\n\nbecause VAWA therefore allows such separation, DOJ’s reliance upon VAWA \nfor its Ultimatum is misplaced. \n328.  Additionally,  schools’  practice  of  maintaining  restrooms  and \nlocker rooms separated by sex does not discriminate based on gender identity. \n329.  Thus,  VAWA  is  inapposite,  and  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  it  for  its \nUltimatum to the State and the University System is misplaced. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  pray  that  the  Court  grant  the \nrelief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for judgment as follows and \nrequest the following relief: \nA.  That this Court declare that the Department of Education’s new \nrule, which redefines the word “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender \nidentity,  and  upon  which  the  Department  of  Justice  relies  in  issuing  its \nUltimatum  to  the  State  and  University,  violates  the  provisions  and \nrequirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and so is unlawful and \nunenforceable  by  the  Department  of  Education  and  the  Department  of \nJustice; and that this Court declare that the Department of Justice and the \nDepartment of Education cannot rely upon an unlawful rule for purposes of \ndetermining the requirements of Title IX (Count I); \n65 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 65 of 69\n\nB.  That this Court declare that Title IX does not require educational \ninstitutions to allow males the right of entry and use of female restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and changing facilities, and vice versa, but rather allows such \ninstitutions to maintain sex-specific facilities (Count II); \nC.  That this Court declare that the Violence Against Women Act \ndoes not require educational institutions to allow males the right of entry and \nuse of female restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities, and vice versa, \nbut rather allows such institutions to maintain sex-specific facilities (Count \nIII); \nD.  That this Court enter a preliminary and permanent injunction \nrestraining  Defendants,  their  officers,  agents,  employees,  and  all  other \npersons acting in concert with them from taking any action contrary to this \nCourt’s Declarations, including the threatened revocation of federal funding \nmade available to the University System and the State’s schools;  \nE.  That this Court retain jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose \nof enforcing any Orders that it issues; \nF.  That  this  Court  award  Plaintiffs  costs  and  expenses  of  this \naction, including a reasonable attorneys’ fees award, in accordance with 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412; \n66 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 66 of 69\n\nG.  That this Court issue the requested injunctive relief without a \ncondition of bond or other security being required of Plaintiffs; and \nH.  That this Court grant such other and further relief as the Court \ndeems equitable and just in the circumstances.   \n67 \n \nCase 1:16-cv-00845-TDS-JEP   Document 58   Filed 08/22/16   Page 67 of 69\n\nRespectfully submitted this 22nd day of August, 2016. \n \n/s/ James A.

LYNCH, in her official \ncapacity as United States Attorney \nGeneral; UNITED STATES \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; \nand JOHN B. KING, JR., in his official \ncapacity as United States Secretary of \nEducation. \nDefendants. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \nNorth Carolinians for Privacy states as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The Plaintiff, North Carolinians for Privacy, brings this declaratory \naction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.A.  §§  2201-02  on  behalf  of  its  members,  who  are \nstudents  in  the  University  of  North  Carolina  University  System;  students  at \nelementary, middle, and high schools throughout North Carolina; and parents of \nthe students who are minor children. \n2.  North Carolinians for Privacy asks this Court to declare that: \n1 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 1 of 50\n\na.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Education \nmay  not  lawfully  rely  on  and  enforce  the  Department  of \nEducation’s  redefinition  of  “sex”  in  Title  IX,  because  the \nDepartment’s  agency  action  of  redefining  “sex”  violated  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act; \nb.  The maintenance of sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms by \neducational  institutions  does  not  violate  the  requirements  of \nTitle IX, codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et. seq., which prohibits \ndiscrimination  in  education  or  educational  benefits  and \nprograms because of a person’s “sex;” and  \nc.  The maintenance of sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms by \neducational institutions does not violate the requirements of the \nViolence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), codified at 42 U.S.C.A. \n§§  13925  et  seq.,  which  prohibits  discrimination  in  certain \nprograms  and  activities  in  education  because  of  a  person’s \n“gender identity.” \n3.  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  also  asks  this  Court  to  enjoin  the \nDefendants from taking any action inconsistent with this Court’s declaration that \nwould affect its members’ rights.  \n4.  The federal Department of Justice (“DOJ”) sent letters to the Governor \nof North Carolina, as well as the President of the University of North Carolina \nSystem,  last  Wednesday  (May  4,  2016),  demanding  that  the  State  and  the \n2 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 2 of 50\n\nUniversity  System  allow  biological  males  to  use  restrooms  and  locker  rooms \ndesignated for women, and to allow biological females to use restrooms and locker \nrooms designated for men. \n5.  DOJ’s letters threatened that, if the State of North Carolina and the \nUniversity System do not comply, DOJ would invoke its power to enforce Title IX \nthrough “‘any other means authorized by law,’ including judicial enforcement,” and \nto “enforce VAWA through civil actions,” and revoke federal funds made available \npursuant to Title IX and VAWA. \n6.  Yesterday, May 9, 2016, the DOJ filed suit against the State of North \nCarolina and the University System. \n7.  At a press conference announcing the lawsuit, United States Attorney \nGeneral Loretta Lynch stated that DOJ “retain[ed] the option of curtailing federal \nfunding” for North Carolina and its schools, including the University System.1 \n8.  In response to a question at the press conference, Attorney General \nLynch stated that, “It would be premature right now to give a date on when we \nactually will take that step” of revoking federal funds.2 \n                                                 \n1 Department of Justice, “Remarks as prepared for Delivery,” May 9, 2016, available \nat  https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-delivers-\nremarks-press-conference-announcing-complaint (last visited May 9, 2016).  \n2 Jane Stancill, “UNC President Spellings: UNC system caught in middle of state, \nfederal  fight  on  HB2,”  The  News  &Observer,  May  9,  2016,  available  at \nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article76612287.html  (last \nvisited May 9, 2016). \n3 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 3 of 50\n\n9.  The  University  System’s  spokesperson  has  publicly  stated  that  the \nUniversity  System’s  federal  funds,  including  its  students’  eligibility  for  student \nloans, are at stake.3 \n10.  The  total  amount  of  federal  funds  at  stake  is  approximately  $1.4 \nbillion, while the total amount of federal student loans that the University System’s \nstudents will lose is approximately $800 million.4 \n11.  Some of the members of North Carolinians for Privacy are students \ncurrently within the University System, or will be students within the University \nSystem beginning next year. \n12.  All  of  these  students’  educational  opportunities  will  be  adversely \nimpacted if the federal government revokes the federal funding that the University \nSystem receives.   \n13.  Additionally,  some  of  these  students  receive  currently  Pell  Grants, \nfederal student loans, or other sources of federal funding, all of which is now at risk.  \n14.  These students’ current and future educational opportunities, as well \nas their financial ability to secure an education at colleges within the University \nSystem, will be directly impacted if the federal government determines that the \n                                                 \n3 Emery P. Dalesio, “NC college system’s federal funds in crosshairs of LGBT law,” \nCTPost, May 8, 2016, available at http://www.ctpost.com/news/politics/article/North-\nCarolina-leaders-denounce-federal-threat-on-7394507.php  (last  visited  May  8, \n2016). \n4 Pete Williams et al., “DOJ Files Lawsuit Challenging North Carolina Bathroom \nLaw,”  NBC  News,  May  9,  2016,  available  at  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-\nnews/north-carolina-gov-pat-mccrory-faces-monday-deadline-lgbt-law-n570396  (last \nvisited May 9, 2016).  \n4 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 4 of 50\n\nUniversity System is in violation of Title IX, and so makes those students ineligible \nto receive this federal financial assistance while attending the University System.   \n15.  Also included within North Carolinians for Privacy are elementary and \nsecondary school students and their parents.   \n16.  Their schools are public schools in North Carolina that receive federal \nfunding pursuant to Title IX. \n17.  They are aware that the federal government has previously threatened \nto  revoke  federal  funding  when  public  school  districts  sought  to  maintain  sex-\nspecific restrooms and locker rooms.   \n18.  DOJ’s letter to the Governor indicates that DOJ requires their public \nelementary and secondary schools to allow biological male students entry and use of \nthe restrooms and locker rooms designated for females, and also to allow biological \nfemale students entry and use of the restrooms and locker rooms designated for \nmales. \n19.  DOJ  is  threatening  to  revoke  Plaintiff’s  members’  schools’  federal \nfunding pursuant to Title IX if the State does not require its public schools to grant \nsuch rights of entry and use. \n20.  Their  educational  opportunities  will  be  adversely  impacted  if  the \nfederal government revokes their schools’ federal funding. \n21.  In its letters to the State and the University System, DOJ relied on a \nnew rule, created by the Department of Education (“DOE”), that forbids educational \ninstitutions from maintaining sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms.   \n5 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 5 of 50\n\n22.  DOJ also stated that Title IX and VAWA forbid sex-specific restrooms \nand locker rooms in educational institutions.  \n23.  DOE’s  action  in  creating  its  new  rule  violates  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 500 et seq., and is unlawful, as is DOJ’s \nreliance on it.  \n24.  Title IX and VAWA both allow for sex-specific restrooms and locker \nrooms. \n25.  North Carolinians for Privacy therefore seeks a declaration from this \nCourt to that effect, in order to put an immediate end to the ongoing threat to their \nability to access educational opportunities at elementary, middle, and high schools \nthroughout North Carolina and at colleges within the University System. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE   \n26.   This  action  arises  under  28  U.S.C.A.  §§  2201-02  (the  “Declaratory \nJudgments Act”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500 et seq. (the “Administrative Procedure Act” or the \n“APA”), and 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et. seq. (“Title IX”).  \n27.   The  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343, 1361, and 1367. \n28.  The Court has jurisdiction to issue the  requested declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57.   \n29.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  award  the  requested  injunctive  relief \nunder  5  U.S.C.  §§  702  and  703,  20  U.S.C.  §  1683,  and  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 65. \n6 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 6 of 50\n\n30.  The Court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneys’ fees and \ncosts under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n31.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e), \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims \noccurred in this district.  \nPLAINTIFF \n32.   Plaintiff North Carolinians for Privacy is an unincorporated non-profit \nassociation  organized  under  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  Ann.  §  59B-1  through  B-15,  and \nheadquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. \n33.  North Carolinians for Privacy exists to advocate for, and protect, bodily \nprivacy in the State of North Carolina and to ensure their members need not give \nup their right to privacy in order to access educational opportunities at elementary, \nmiddle, and high schools throughout North Carolina and at colleges within the \nUniversity System. \n34.  Its members have an interest in this litigation because the action of \nthe  DOJ  threatens  bodily  privacy  rights in  North  Carolina  and  their  ability  to \ncontinue  to  access  educational  opportunities  at  elementary,  middle,  and  high \nschools throughout North Carolina and at colleges within the University System.    \n35.  North Carolinians for Privacy’s members are all United States citizens \nand residents of the State of North Carolina. \n36.  Some of its members are directly impacted by DOJ’s actions, which \nthreaten to revoke federal funding if the State and University System do not allow \n7 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 7 of 50\n\nbiological males the right of entry and use of restrooms and locker rooms designated \nfor females, and vice versa.   \n37.  Some  of  its  members  are  students  within  the  University  of  North \nCarolina System (the “University Students”), or will be matriculating next school \nyear as freshmen to colleges within the University System.   \n38.  Some  of  its  members  are  students  in  North  Carolina  elementary \nschools, middle schools, or high schools that receive federal funding (the “Minor \nStudents”). \n39.  Some of its members are parents of Minor Students (the “Parents”).   \nDEFENDANTS \nDefendant Department of Justice \n40.  Defendant Department of Justice is an executive agency of the United \nStates government and is responsible for the enforcement of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1681-1688, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. DOJ also has \nauthority to bring enforcement actions to enforce Title IX and VAWA. \nDefendant Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch \n41.  Defendant Loretta E. Lynch is the United States Attorney General. In \nthis capacity, she is responsible for the operation and management of the DOJ. \nLynch is sued in her official capacity only. \nDefendant Department of Education \n42.   Defendant  Department  of  Education  is  an  executive  agency  of  the \nUnited States government and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, \n8 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 8 of 50\n\nand  enforcement  of  Title  IX,  20  U.S.C.  §§  1681-1688,  and  its  implementing \nregulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. \n43.  DOE is responsible for adopting, promulgating, and enforcing its new \nlegislative rule interpreting “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender identity.   \nDefendant Secretary John B. King, Jr. \n44.  Defendant  John  B.  King,  Jr.,  is  the  United  States  Secretary  of \nEducation. In this capacity, he is responsible for the operation and management of \nthe DOE. King is sued in his official capacity only.   \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  DOJ Relies on DOE’S Unlawful Agency Action \nAnd Misunderstandings of VAWA \n \nA.    Title IX and Its Meaning \n45.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance…” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. \n46.  The regulations implementing Title IX provide, in relevant part, that \n“no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  academic, \nextracurricular…or  other  education  program  or  activity  operated  by  a  recipient \nwhich receives Federal financial assistance.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a). \n47.  The implementing regulations also provide that a funding recipient \nshall  not  on  the  basis  of  sex:  “Treat  one  person  differently  from  another  in \n9 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 9 of 50\n\ndetermining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the \nprovision  of  such  aid,  benefit,  or  service;  …  Provide  different  aid,  benefits,  or \nservices or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner; … Deny any \nperson  any  such  aid,  benefit,  or  service;  …  Subject  any  person  to  separate  or \ndifferent rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; …[or] Otherwise limit any \nperson  in  the  enjoyment  of  any  right,  privilege,  advantage,  or  opportunity.”  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31(b). \n48.  Nothing  in  Title  IX’s  text,  structure,  legislative  history,  or \naccompanying regulations addresses gender identity.  \n49.  The term “gender identity” does not appear in the text of Title IX. \n50.  The  term  “gender  identity”  does  not  appear  in  the  regulations \naccompanying Title IX.  \n51.  The term “gender identity” does not appear in the legislative history \nrelating to Title IX. \n52.  Indeed,  recognizing  that  Title  IX  does  not  protect  against \ndiscrimination because of “gender identity” (but only against discrimination because \nof biological sex), beginning in 2011, Senator Al Franken has repeatedly introduced \nlegislation modeled after Title IX that would protect against discrimination because \nof  gender  identity  in  the  education  context,  just  as  Title  IX  protects  against \ndiscrimination because of sex. \n53.  That legislation has failed to pass every year it has been introduced. \n10 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 10 of 50\n\n54.  Title IX  and  the  accompanying  regulations  use  the  term  “sex,”  not \n“gender identity,” in describing the type of discrimination prohibited.  \n55.  The term “sex” as used in Title IX and its implementing regulations \nmeans male and female, under the traditional binary conception of sex consistent \nwith one’s birth or biological sex.  \n56.  Title IX also states that “nothing contained herein shall be construed \nto  prohibit  any  educational  institution  receiving  funds  under  this  Act,  from \nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes[,]” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, \nindicating  that  Congress  intended  that  Title  IX  would  respect  student  privacy \nrights. \n57.  Title IX’s  accompanying regulations confirm that schools “may provide \nseparate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, [as long as] \nsuch facilities provided for students of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities \nprovided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.   \n58.  Preventing  the  mixing  of  biological  boys  and  girls  in  intimate \nenvironments like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers is the very reason that \nCongress allowed for separate living facilities, and that Title IX regulations allow \nfor separate restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas, for the different sexes. \nB.    DOE’s Unlawful Agency Action \n59.  Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  any  “rules  which  do  not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but  which \nestablish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with \n11 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 11 of 50\n\nthe APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they initially are \nlabeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n60.  Such legislative rules enacted under Title IX must also be “approved \nby the President” before they become effective. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n61.  DOE took agency action and declared that the term “sex” as used in \nTitle  IX’s  prohibition  on  sex  discrimination  now  means,  or  includes,  “gender \nidentity.”  \n62.  This agency action constituted the creation of a new legislative rule, \nbecause it announced a new policy position, which the agency is treating as binding. \n63.  DOE announced this new legislative rule redefining “sex” to schools \nnationwide in several DOE guidance documents published over the last few years, \nincluding the following:  U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, \nQuestions  and  Answers  on  Title  IX  and  Sexual  Violence,  5  (Apr.  2014);  U.S. \nDepartment of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and Answers on Title IX \nand Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities, \n25  (Dec.  2014);  U.S.  Department  of  Education,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Title  IX \nResource Guide, 1, 15, 16, 19, 21-22 (Apr. 2015).  \n64.  DOE’s  new  rule  requires  educational  institutions  to  treat  students \nconsistently with their perceived gender identity, regardless of biological sex.  \n65.  DOE has enforced its new rule in numerous secondary school districts \naround the country. \n12 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 12 of 50\n\n66.  For example, DOE threatened Palatine, Illinois, Township High School \nDistrict 211 with the loss of $6 million dollars in federal funds if it failed to grant a \nbiologically male student access to the girls’ locker and shower rooms. \n67.  DOE  has  treated  its  declaration  that  Title  IX  bars  gender  identity \ndiscrimination as a legislative rule that is binding on all schools that are subject to \nTitle IX. \n68.  DOE is actively enforcing this legislative rule against schools across \nthe country. \n69.  DOE  did  not  comply  with  APA’s  notice-and-comment  requirements \nwhen it adopted its legislative rule redefining “sex” in Title IX to include gender \nidentity and mandating that schools give students seeking access to opposite sex \nfacilities based on their gender identity the access they desire. \n70.  DOE’s new rule was not published for notice and comment. \n71.  DOE’s new rule was not signed by the President. \nC.    DOJ’s Improper Reliance on DOE’s Unlawful Agency Action  \n72.  Last week, on Wednesday, May 4, 2016, the federal Department of \nJustice  (DOJ)  sent  letters  to  the  Governor  of  the  state  of  North  Carolina  (the \n“Letter to the Governor”),5 along with the President of the University of North \nCarolina System (the “Letter to the University System”).6  \n                                                 \n5 Letter, U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to Governor Pat McCrory, \nMay  4,  2016,  available  at  https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2823410/-\nCivil-Rights-Division-letter-on-HB2.pdf;  Letter,  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  Civil \nRights  Division  to Margaret  Spellings, President,  University  of  North  Carolina, \nMay  4,  2016,  available  at  http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-\n13 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 13 of 50\n\n73.  Those letters stated that if the State and University System complied \nwith a North Carolina law known as H.B. 2, which requires multiple occupancy \nbathroom or changing facilities to be designated for the use of only students of one \nbiological sex, the State would violate Title VII, and the University System would \nviolate Titles VII, IX and VAWA.   \n74.  Those  letters  also  include  a  demand:  stop  enforcing  H.B.  2  or  face \nimminent enforcement actions, including a revocation of their federal funding. \n75.  DOJ’s  lawsuit,  filed  against  the  State  and  the  University  System, \namplified that demand.  \n76.  The  letters  and  the  lawsuit  together  create  an  unmistakable \nultimatum: either submit to the will of DOJ by prohibiting sex-specific restrooms \nand locker rooms in educational institutions, or face the consequences, including \nrevocation of federal funds (“the Ultimatum”). \n77.  The Letter to the Governor notes in footnote 3 that H.B. 2 applies to \nlocal boards of education, thus recognizing that public schools are prohibited by \nstate  law  from  allowing  biological  males  to  enter  and  use  private  facilities \ndesignated for females, and vice versa. Letter to the Governor, supra note 5, at 2 \nn.3. \n                                                                                                                                                             \ngovernment/article75647942.ece/BINARY/Read:%20DOJ%20letter%20to%20UNC \n(last visited May 8, 2016). \n6 Letter, U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to Margaret Spellings, \nPresident,  University  of  North  Carolina,  May  4,  2016,  available  at \nhttp://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/article75647942.ece/BINARY/Read:%20DOJ%20letter%20to%20UNC \n(last visited May 8, 2016).  \n14 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 14 of 50\n\n78.  The Letter to the Governor states that a similar prohibition, affecting \nthe University of North Carolina System, is a Title IX violation. Id. at 2-3. \n79.  The  Letter  to  the  Governor  also  warns  that,  according  to  DOE’s \nguidance,  “educational  institutions  generally  must  treat  [students  who  perceive \nthemselves as the opposite biological sex] consistent with their gender identity,” and \nthat  DOE’s  guidance  is  “entitled  to  controlling  weight.”  Id.  at  1-2  (quotations \nomitted). \n80.  The Letter to the University System states that the requirements of \nTitle  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  prohibit  the  University  System  from \nmaintaining sex-specific facilities for either employees or students. Letter to the \nUniversity System, supra note 6, at 2-3. \n81.  As authority for this statement, DOJ relies upon DOE’s new legislative \nrule declaring that the term “sex” in Title IX and its implementing regulations \nincludes gender identity. Id. at 3.  \n82.  DOJ  thus  relies  upon  DOE’s  unlawful  agency  action  to  reach  its \ndetermination that the State and the University System will violate Title IX if they \nadhere  to  the  requirements  of  H.B.  2  and  continue  to  maintain  sex-specific \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms in the State’s educational institutions, \nincluding the University System. \nD.    DOJ’s Reliance on a Wrong Understanding of VAWA \n83.  In  the  Letter  to  the  University  System,  DOJ  states  that  VAWA \nprohibits the University System from discriminating based on gender identity, and \n15 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 15 of 50\n\nintimates that VAWA therefore prohibits maintaining sex-specific restrooms and \nlocker rooms. Id. at 2. \n84.  VAWA requires that no one, based on gender identity, “be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available \nunder the [VAWA].” 42 U.S.C.A. § 13925(13)(A) (emphasis added). \n85.  The programs and activities funded under VAWA include, for example, \n“education programs for the prevention of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault,  and  stalking,”  “programs  providing  legal,  medical,  or  psychological \ncounseling, for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking,” the creation of “data collection and communication systems . . . linking \ncampus  security  to  the  local  law  enforcement,  and  the  distribution  of  “print  or \nelectronic  materials  to  address  both  prevention  and  intervention  in  domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual violence, and stalking.” 42 U.S.C. § 14045b(b). \n86.  VAWA funding does not include policies or programs regulating access \nto restrooms or locker rooms. \n87.  DOJ’s Letter to the  University System indicates that DOJ believes \nthat VAWA prohibits the University System and other educational institutions from \nmaintaining  sex-specific  restrooms  and  locker  rooms.  Letter  to  the  University \nSystem, supra note 3, at 2.   \n88.  VAWA  does  not  prohibit  schools  from  maintaining  sex-specific \nrestrooms and locker rooms. \n16 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 16 of 50\n\nII.  The Harm to the Plaintiff’s Members as a Result of DOJ’s Letters \nA.   The Harm to the University Students   \n89.  The  DOJ’s  threatened  enforcement  action,  which  has  already \ncommenced and includes an imminent threat to revoke the University System’s $1.4 \nbillion  in  federal  funding,  places  the  University  Students  at  immediate  risk  of \nsuffering the loss of educational opportunity as a result of decreased funding to the \nUniversity System. \n90.  The loss of such a substantial amount of money would result in severe \ncutbacks  in  educational  programs  from  which  the  University  Students  directly \nbenefit. \n91.  This will directly harm University Students.   \n92.  Further, some of the University Students receive federal financial aid.   \n93.  These University Students rely on that federal financial assistance to \nattend schools in the University System.   \n94.  If DOJ revokes the University System’s eligibility for federal funding, \nthe University Students will no longer be eligible for federal financial assistance. \n95.  Federal  financial  assistance  under  Title  IX  includes  federal  grants, \nloans,  scholarships,  and  wages  that  are  “authorized  or  extended  under  a  law \nadministered by the Federal agency that awards such assistance.” See 65 Fed. Reg. \n52858; see also Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 569 (1984) (noting that \nenforcement action by the DOE against a college for failure to certify compliance \n17 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 17 of 50\n\nwith Title IX would leave students receiving federal financial assistance the choice \nof switching colleges or foregoing the assistance).   \n96.  If  DOJ  follows  through  on  its  threat  to  imminently  revoke  federal \nfunding from the University System due to a Title IX violation, that revocation \nwould also bar students from using federal scholarships, loans, grants, and wages to \npay for tuition to attend a college within the System. \n97.  Students affected by a revocation of the University System’s federal \nfunding  would  have  their  expenditures  related  to  their  college  costs  increase \ndramatically, forcing them to pay far more to attend a college within the System, \ntransfer to a school outside the System, or drop out of school altogether.    \n98.  The University System’s colleges provide the highest quality college \neducation available in North Carolina. \n99.  If  the  University  Students  are  barred  from  using  federal  funds  to \nattend any college within the University System, they will have to attend colleges \nthat provide inferior educational opportunities and degrees.  \n100.  If the University System capitulates to DOJ’s threat, the University \nStudents will suffer the loss of their constitutional right to privacy, because they \nwill  be  compelled  by  the  government  to  use  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  with \nmembers of the opposite sex.  \n101.  The  female  University  Students  in  particular  object  to  the  privacy \nviolations  created  by  allowing  biological  males  the  right  of  entry  and  use  of \nrestrooms and locker rooms designated for females. \n18 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 18 of 50\n\n102.  But  the  female  University  Students  experience  the  added  worry, \nanxiety, stress, and fear caused by the knowledge that allowing biological males the \nright of entry and use of restrooms and locker rooms designated for females places \nthem at higher risk of sexual assault. \n103.  The federal Center for Disease Control reports that “[i]n a nationally \nrepresentative  survey  of  adults,  37.4%  of  female  rape  victims  were  first  raped \nbetween ages 18-24.” Center for Disease Control, Sexual Violence: Facts at a Glance \n(2012),  available  at  http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf \n(last visited May 8, 2016). \n104.  The federal Center for Disease Control reports that, in a study limited \nto undergraduate college women, 19% experienced attempted or completed sexual \nassault since entering college.” Id. (emphasis added). \n105.  The President of the United States has stated that “[a]n estimated one \nin five women has been sexually assaulted during her college years.”  The White \nHouse,  “President  Obama  Launches  the  ‘It’s  On  Us’  Campaign  to  End  Sexual \nAssault  on  Campus,”  September  19,  2014,  available  at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/19/president-obama-launches-its-us-\ncampaign-end-sexual-assault-campus (last visited May 8, 2016). \n106.  The  incidence  of  rape  and  other  forms  of  sexual  assault  on college \ncampuses may be even higher, because the President said that “only 12 percent [of \nsexual assaults] are reported.” Id. \n19 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 19 of 50\n\n107.  Currently, if someone sees a male student enter the female students’ \nprivate facilities, he or she can notify campus security. \n108.  But if Defendants have their way, no one will be able to stop any \nbiological male from entering female restrooms and locker rooms. \n109.  Significantly,  DOJ’s  and  DOE’s  understanding  of  Title  IX  does  not \ninclude a “gender expression” component, but only a “gender identity” component. \n110.  So, according to DOJ and DOE, biological males do not need to present \nas female in order to enter and use female restrooms and locker rooms; rather, they \nmerely must say that they identify as female. \n111.  The  female  University  Students  are  deeply  concerned  that  male \nstudents whose gender identity matches their male biology might take advantage of \nsuch policies for nefarious and lewd purposes.  \n112.  The female University Students are deeply concerned that allowing \nbiological male students into their private facilities increases the likelihood that \nthey will be assaulted or otherwise victimized. \n113.  Additionally, some of the University Students object to using restrooms \nand locker rooms with members of the opposite sex because of their sincerely held \nreligious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \nB.  The Harm to the Minor Students and their Parents \n114.  The Minor Students all attend schools in North Carolina that receive \nfederal funds pursuant to Title IX. \n20 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 20 of 50\n\n115.  Their schools, like all schools receiving federal funds, rely on those \nfunds to provide numerous educational programs and activities. \n116.  The DOJ and DOE are authorized to revoke federal funds of schools \nfound to be in violation of Title IX. \n117.  If  the  Minor  Students’  schools  lose  their  federal  funds,  the  Minor \nStudents  will  suffer  the  harm  of  fewer,  or  inferior,  educational  programs  and \nactivities.  \n118.  Additionally, if the Minor Students’ schools capitulate to DOJ’s threat, \nthe  Minor  Students  will  suffer  the  loss  of  their  constitutional  right  to  privacy, \nbecause they will be compelled by the government to use restrooms and locker \nrooms with members of the opposite sex. \n119.  The Minor Students’ Parents desire for their minor children to receive \na high-quality public education.   \n120.  If  the  Minor  Students’  schools  lose  their  federal  funds,  the  Minor \nStudents  will  suffer  the  harm  of  fewer,  or  inferior,  educational  programs  and \nactivities, and the Parents’ desire for their minor children to receive a high-quality \npublic education will be frustrated.  \n121.  If the Minor Students’ schools capitulate to DOJ’s threat, each Parent’s \nright to direct the education and upbringing of their children—including their right \nto control whether their children will be exposed to people of the opposite sex in \nintimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers—will be \n21 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 21 of 50\n\nviolated because their minor children will be compelled by the government to use \nrestrooms and locker rooms with members of the opposite sex.  \n122.  All of the Parents object to their children, the Minor Students, using \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  with  opposite-sex  students,  enduring  the  risk  of \nexposure  to  opposite-sex  nudity,  and  enduring  the  risk  of  exposing  their  own \nundressed or partially unclothed bodies to members of the opposite sex. \n123.  Additionally, some of the Minor Students and Parents object to the \nMinor Students using restrooms and locker rooms with members of the opposite sex \nbecause of their sincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \n124.  If DOJ is allowed to forbid the State from maintaining sex-specific \nrestrooms and locker rooms on its campuses, the University Students will either \n(1) suffer the loss of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to bodily privacy, or (2) \nsuffer  the  loss  of  educational  opportunities  and  their  ability  to  access  federal \nfinancial assistance, because the University System refuses to comply with DOJ’s \nUltimatum, and their schools’ federal funds are revoked by the federal government. \n125.  If DOJ is allowed to forbid the State from maintaining sex-specific \nrestrooms and locker rooms in its local school districts, the Minor Students will \neither (1) suffer the loss of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to bodily privacy, \nor  (2)  suffer  the  loss  of  educational  opportunities  because  the  State  refuses  to \ncomply with DOJ’s Ultimatum, and their schools’ federal funds are revoked by the \nfederal government.   \n22 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 22 of 50\n\n126.  If DOJ is allowed to forbid the State from maintaining sex-specific \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  in  local  school  districts,  the  Parents  will  either \n(1) suffer the loss of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to direct the education \nand  upbringing  of  their  minor  children,  or  (2)  suffer  the  loss  of  educational \nopportunities for their children, because the State refuses to comply with DOJ’s \nUltimatum, and their schools’ federal funds are revoked by the federal government. \n127.  The University Students, Minor Students, and their Parents should \nnot be forced to suffer any of these results, because providing single-sex restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and shower facilities does not violate Title IX or VAWA, as DOJ’s \nUltimatum claims. \n128.  To  preserve  the  legal  rights  of  the  University  Students,  Minor \nStudents,  and  Parents,  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  needs  a  declaration  and \ninjunction from this Court.   \n129.  North Carolinians for Privacy has no adequate remedy at law. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATION THAT DOJ AND DOE CANNOT RELY UPON DOE’S \nREDEFINION OF “SEX” IN TITLE IX BECAUSE THE REDEFINITION \nVIOLATES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT7 \n130.   North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  realleges  all  matters  set  forth  in \nparagraphs 1 through 129 and incorporate them herein. \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiff raises its federal constitutional and statutory arguments in the context of \nits APA claim, because presently the imminent harm to Plaintiff is DOJ’s revocation \nof  Title  IX  funding  pursuant  to  the  DOE’s  unlawful  interpretation  of  Title  IX.  \nHowever, should the University System or other North Carolina school officials \ncapitulate  to  the  DOJ’s  demand  and  permit  males  into  females’  restrooms  and \nchanging areas, and vice versa, Plaintiff will amend the complaint to add those \nofficials  as  defendants  and  assert  separate  constitutional  and  statutory  claims \nagainst them.   \n23 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 23 of 50\n\n131.  DOE  promulgated,  and  is  enforcing,  a  new  legislative  rule  that \nredefines the term “sex” in Title IX and its accompanying regulations to mean, or at \nleast include, “gender identity.” \n132.  Pursuant to Executive Order 12250, the DOJ also has authority to \nbring enforcement actions to enforce Title IX. \n133.  DOJ’s  enforcement  of  Title  IX  is  reviewable  pursuant  to  20  U.S.C \n§ 1683.  \n134.  Threatened  adverse  action  pursuant  to  Title  IX  constitutes  final, \nreviewable action. \n135.  DOJ’s  letters,  along  with  its  lawsuit  and  the  Attorney  General’s \ncomments at her press conference, all threaten revocation of Title IX funding. \n136.  Such threats of funding revocation are final, reviewable agency action. \n137.  DOJ  relied  upon  DOE’s  new  rule  redefining  “sex”  and,  with  its \nUltimatum, is enforcing that rule against the State and the University System, and \nso against the University Students and the Minor Students and their Parents. \n138.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  declares  that  Title  IX  requires  educational \ninstitutions to permit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers based \non their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. \n139.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  declares  that  Title  IX  prohibits  educational \ninstitutions from maintaining sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms. \n24 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 24 of 50\n\n140.  DOJ’s Ultimatum, if allowed to stand, would also prohibit educational \ninstitutions from maintaining sex-specific living facilities, which Title IX specifically \nauthorizes. 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n141.  DOJ’s reliance upon DOE’s new rule is misplaced. \n142.  DOE’s  new  rule  redefining  “sex”  in  Title  IX  contradicts  the  text, \nstructure, legislative history, and historical judicial interpretation of Title IX, all of \nwhich  confirm  that  the  term,  “sex,”  means  male  and  female  in  the  binary  and \nbiological sense.   \n143.  According to DOE’s new legislative rule, Title IX requires educational \ninstitutions to permit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers based \non their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. \n144.  According to DOE’s new legislative rule, Title IX prohibits educational \ninstitutions from maintaining sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms. \n145.  DOE has communicated this new legislative rule to school districts and \ncolleges nationwide and stated that their failure to comply with it will result in \ninvestigation and enforcement action up to and including withdrawal of billions of \ndollars in federal funding. \n146.  DOE’s  promulgation  and  enforcement  of  this  new  legislative  rule, \nwhich DOJ relies upon, are likewise reviewable actions under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”).   \n147.  DOJ cannot rely upon DOE’s new rule, and enforce it against the State \nand University, if DOE’s new rule violates the APA and so is unlawful. \n25 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 25 of 50\n\n148.  DOE’s agency actions, including the creation of rules, are reviewable \npursuant to 20 U.S.C § 1683. \n149.  DOE’s new rule is a final, reviewable agency action, and there is no \nother adequate remedy, because DOJ now relies upon that rule to threaten the \nState and University System, which causes harm to the University Students, Minor \nStudents, and Parents.   \n150.  North Carolinians for Privacy cannot obtain relief unless this Court \ndeclares that DOE’s actions are unlawful so that DOJ cannot rely upon them. \n151.  The members of North Carolinians for Privacy have suffered a legal \nwrong as a direct result of the DOE’s agency action, upon which DOJ relies, because \nNorth Carolinians for Privacy’s members’ constitutional and statutory rights will be \nviolated if the State and University System submit to DOJ’s improper demand.   \n152.  Under the APA, a reviewing Court must “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” in four instances that apply to this case:  \n•  One:  if  the  agency  action  is  “in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);  \n•  Two:  if  the  agency  action  is  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);  \n•  Three: if the agency action is “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); and  \n•  Four: if the agency action is “without observance of procedure required \nby law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n26 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 26 of 50\n\n153.  DOE’s promulgation of its new rule, upon which DOJ relies, violates \nall four of these standards and so should be held unlawful and set aside. \nA.  DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is In Excess of \nStatutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations \n \n154.  DOE’s  actions  in  promulgating  and  enforcing  its  new  rule  are  “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” \nbecause they redefine the unambiguous term “sex” and add gender identity to Title \nIX without the authorization of Congress.  \n155.  Congress has not delegated to DOE the authority to define, or redefine, \nunambiguous terms in Title IX. \n156.  Title IX, passed in 1972, states that “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination…”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). \n157.  The term “sex” as used in Title IX means male and female, under the \ntraditional binary conception of sex consistent with one’s birth or biological sex.  \n158.  This definition is not ambiguous. \n159.  Title IX makes no reference to “gender identity” in the language of the \nstatute. \n160.  The  enacting  regulations,  which  interpret  Title  IX  and  were \npromulgated in 1975, likewise make no reference to “gender identity.”   \n161.  The  legislative  history  of  Title  IX  makes  no  reference  to  “gender \nidentity.”  \n27 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 27 of 50\n\n162.  Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations  are  not  ambiguous  in  their \ninstruction that a school district may separate restrooms, locker rooms, and shower \nfacilities on the basis of biological sex. \n163.  Title IX permits schools receiving federal funds to “maintain[] separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n164.  The  regulations  implementing  Title  IX  state  that  schools  receiving \nfederal funding “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for students of one sex [are] \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § \n106.33.   \n165.  Title IX does not require that the University System, or the State, open \nschool restrooms, locker rooms and shower rooms to the opposite biological sex.  \n166.  DOE’s  unilateral  decree  that  “sex”  in  Title  IX  includes  “gender \nidentity,” which requires schools to allow males who identify as female to use the \ngirls’  facilities,  and  vice  versa,  requires  is  not  supported  by  Title  IX’s  text, \nimplementing regulations, or legislative history.   \n167.  The new rule is contradicted by the fact that every court to consider \nthe question for the past four decades, prior to the DOE’s April 2015 Guidance \nDocument  equating  sex  discrimination  with  gender  identity  discrimination,  had \nconcluded that Title IX did not require cross-sex restrooms or locker rooms, even \nwhen students who identify as the opposite sex are involved.  \n28 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 28 of 50\n\n168.  The new rule is contradicted by the fact that Congress has considered \nproposed legislation that would add Title IX style protections for gender identity \ndiscrimination, but has declined to enact it. \n169.  Therefore, the DOE’s rule was promulgated and enforced “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations, or short of statutory right[,]” See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  This Court should hold that it is unlawful and set it aside.  \n170.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were interpretive, \ninstead of legislative, because it violates the Constitution and federal statutes, and \nis also plainly erroneous and inconsistent with Title IX itself.   \nB.  DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, An Abuse of Discretion, or Not In Accordance With Law \n \n171.  DOE’s  actions  in  promulgating  and  enforcing  its  new  rule  are \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n172.  Congress requires that whenever an agency takes action it do so after \nengaging in a process by which it “examine[s] the relevant data and articulate[s] a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made.” Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass’n. v. State Farm Ins., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation omitted). \n173.  An agency action is “arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied \non factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \n29 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 29 of 50\n\nascribed to a difference in view or product of agency expertise.” State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 43. \n174.  DOE gave no explanation whatsoever for its redefinition of “sex” in \nTitle IX, whereby DOE unilaterally decreed that the term, “sex,” in Title IX includes \ngender identity.   \n175.  Nor did DOE give any explanation of the relevant factors that were the \nbasis of its actions. \n176.  DOE failed to consider important aspects of the problems caused by \nmixing biological boys and girls in intimate settings, including the language and \nstructure of Title IX and its regulations; the congressional, and judicial histories of \nTitle IX and its regulations; the practical and constitutional harms created by its \nunlawful  application  of  Title  IX;  and,  the  violation  of  Title  IX  caused  by  this \nunlawful application. \n177.  DOE’s action was also made without a rational explanation.  \n178.  It departed from the established Title IX policy that allowed schools to \nmaintain  private  facilities  separated  by  biological  sex;  and,  it  rested  on \nconsiderations  related  to  “gender  identity,”  despite  the  fact  that  the  legislative \nhistory  indicates  Congress  did  not  intend  “sex”  to  mean  anything  other  than \nbiological sex. \n179.  DOE’s  action  was  also  made  even  though  it  is  contrary  to  law  or \nregulation.  \n30 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 30 of 50\n\n180.  DOE’s  rule  purporting  to  redefine  Title  IX  violates  Title  IX  as  it \napplies  to  the  very  group  Title  IX  was  created  to  protect,  female  students,  by \ncreating a hostile environment for them. \n181.  DOE’s rule is thus contrary to Title IX. \n182.  DOE’s new rule is also contrary to the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct (“RFRA”), codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb et seq. \n183.  Some of the University Students object to using restrooms and locker \nrooms with members of the opposite sex because of their sincerely held religious \nbeliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n184.  Some of the Minor Students and Parents object to the Minor Students \nusing restrooms and locker rooms with members of the opposite sex because of their \nsincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n185.  Allowing opposite-sex students right of entry and use of restrooms and \nlocker rooms will substantially burden these sincerely held religious beliefs. \n186.  RFRA  does  not  allow  the  government  to  substantially  burden  free \nexercise  of  religion  unless  the  regulation  satisfies  strict  scrutiny  review,  which \nrequires that the government demonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a \ncompelling interest in the least restrictive means available. \n187.  DOJ  and  DOE  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  the \nUniversity Students and the Minor Students to share restrooms and locker rooms \nwith opposite sex persons.  \n31 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 31 of 50\n\n188.  Also,  DOJ  and  DOE  have  not  used  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nserving any interest they may have. \n189.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  which,  if \nimplemented, would prohibit the University System and those schools maintained \nby the State and its political subdivisions from retaining their sex-specific restrooms \nand locker rooms, fails the required strict scrutiny review and is unlawful under, \nand contrary to,  RFRA.  \n190.  DOE’s  promulgation  and  enforcement  of  its  rule  is  thus  arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law.  This Court \nshould therefore hold that it is unlawful and set it aside.  \n191.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were  interpretive, \ninstead of legislative, because it would still be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and not in accordance with law, and so is due to be declared unlawful \nand set aside. \nC.  DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Contrary to \nConstitutional Right, Power, Privilege, or Immunity \n \n192.  DOE’s actions are “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n193.  DOE’s legislative rule is an unlawful application of Title IX contrary to \nthe Constitution because it violates numerous constitutional rights of the members \nof North Carolinians for Privacy, including the fundamental right to privacy; the \nfundamental  liberty  interest  in  directing  the  education  and  upbringing  of  one’s \nchildren; and, the First Amendment’s guarantee of free exercise of religion.   \n32 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 32 of 50\n\n1. Privacy Rights Are Violated \n194.  There is a fundamental constitutional right to bodily privacy in one’s \nfully or partially unclothed body. \n195.  This fundamental right also includes the right to be free from State-\ncompelled risk of intimate exposure of oneself to the opposite sex. \n196.  The right to be free from State-compelled risk of intimate exposure of \noneself  to  the  opposite  sex,  while  part  of  the  right  to  bodily  privacy,  is  also \nseparately and deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition and implicit in \nthe concept of ordered liberty, and so is itself a fundamental constitutional right. \n197.  Allowing opposite-sex students right of entry and use of restrooms and \nlocker  rooms  will  infringe  the  University  Students’  and  the  Minor  Students’ \nfundamental right to privacy in their unclothed bodies, as well as their fundamental \nright to be free from government-compelled risk of intimate exposure to the opposite \nsex, without any compelling justification.  \n198.  The  government  may  not  infringe  fundamental  rights,  unless  the \ninfringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that the government \ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling interest in the least \nrestrictive means available. \n199.  DOJ  and  DOE  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  the \nUniversity Students and the Minor Students to share restrooms and locker rooms \nwith opposite sex persons.  \n33 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 33 of 50\n\n200.  Also,  DOJ  and  DOE  have  not  used  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nserving any interest they may have. \n201.  Accordingly,  DOE’s  new  rule  and  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  that  the \nUniversity  System  and  those  schools  maintained  by  the  State  and  its  political \nsubdivisions will face enforcement actions to revoke their federal funding if they \nretain  their  sex-specific  restrooms  and  locker  rooms,  fails  the  required  strict \nscrutiny review and is unconstitutional.  \n2. Fundamental Parental Rights Are Violated \n202.  The right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, \nand control of their children is a fundamental right protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause. \n203.  Included within that parental fundamental right is the power to direct \nthe education and upbringing of one’s children. \n204.  This fundamental right gives parents the freedom, as well as the duty, \nto instill moral standards and values in their minor children. \n205.  This fundamental right encompasses the right to determine whether, \nand when, their minor children endure the risk of being in intimate, vulnerable \nsettings like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers, with members of the opposite \nsex. \n206.  It also encompasses the right to determine whether their children will \nhave to risk being exposed to opposite sex nudity at school and a fundamental right \n34 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 34 of 50\n\nto determine whether their children, while at school, will have to risk exposing their \nown undressed or partially unclothed bodies to members of the opposite sex. \n207.  All of the Parents object to their children, the Minor Students, using \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  with  opposite-sex  students,  enduring  the  risk  of \nexposure  to  opposite-sex  nudity,  and  enduring  the  risk  of  exposing  their  own \nundressed or partially unclothed bodies to members of the opposite sex. \n208.  Allowing opposite-sex students right of entry and use of restrooms and \nlocker rooms will infringe this fundamental parental right. \n209.  Defendants may not infringe fundamental rights, including parents’ \nfundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, unless \nthe infringement satisfies strict scrutiny review. \n210.  Defendants  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  school \nchildren to share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates. \n211.  Also, Defendants have not used the least restrictive means of serving \nany interest they may have. \n212.  Accordingly, DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum, that those schools \nmaintained by the State and its political subdivisions will face enforcement actions \nto revoke their federal funding if they retain their sex-specific restrooms and locker \nrooms, fails the required strict scrutiny review and is unconstitutional. \n3. Free Exercise Rights Are Violated. \n213.  The  First  Amendment  provides  that  Congress  shall  make  no  law \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \n35 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 35 of 50\n\n214.  Some of the University Students object to using restrooms and locker \nrooms with members of the opposite sex because of their sincerely held religious \nbeliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n215.  Some of the Minor Students and Parents object to the Minor Students \nusing restrooms and locker rooms with members of the opposite sex because of their \nsincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity. \n216.  Allowing opposite-sex students right of entry and use of restrooms and \nlocker rooms will infringe the free exercise rights of these University Students, \nMinor Students, and their Parents. \n217.  Laws  that  burden  free  exercise,  but  are  not  neutral  or  generally \napplicable, are subject to strict scrutiny.   \n218.  DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum are not generally applicable \nbecause it does not allow all students to use the opposite-sex restrooms and locker \nrooms, but only students who perceive themselves as a different gender than their \nbiological sex. \n219.  Because the DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum are not generally \napplicable, it is subject to strict scrutiny. \n220.  Additionally, DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum is subject to strict \nscrutiny because, in addition to burdening free exercise rights, it also burdens other \nconstitutional rights.  \n221.  Defendants  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  school \nchildren to share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates. \n36 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 36 of 50\n\n222.  Also, Defendants have not used the least restrictive means of serving \nany interest they may have. \n223.  Accordingly, DOE’s new rule and DOJ’s Ultimatum, that those schools \nmaintained by the State and its political subdivisions will face enforcement actions \nto revoke their federal funding if they retain their sex-specific restrooms and locker \nrooms, fails the required strict scrutiny review and is unconstitutional. \n4. Spending Clause Requirements Are Violated \n224.  Also, DOE’s legislative rule is in violation of the Spending Clause of \nthe United States Constitution, under which Title IX was enacted.  \n225.  When  Congress  uses  its  Spending  Clause  power,  it  generates \nlegislation much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States \nagree to comply with federally imposed conditions. \n226.  Congress  must  clearly  and  unambiguously  state  the  conditions  to \nwhich the States are agreeing in exchange for federal funds, so that the States can \nknowingly decide whether to accept the funding. \n227.  The crucial inquiry is whether Congress spoke so clearly that it can be \nfairly said that the State could make an informed choice. \n228.  Requiring educational institutions to allow biological males access to \nfacilities designated for females cannot pass this test, no matter how the males \nidentify.  \n37 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 37 of 50\n\n229.  Requiring educational institutions to allow biological females access to \nfacilities designated for males cannot pass this test, no matter how the females \nidentify.  \n230.  As already explained, the plain language of the text, along with the \nlegislative history, clearly indicates that Congress intended that (1) “sex” means \n“biological sex;” (2) Title IX prevents discrimination based on biological sex; and \n(3) Title IX allows sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, and living facilities. \n231.  Further,  the  implementing  regulations  specifically  allow  schools  to \nmaintain restrooms and locker rooms separated by biological sex. \n232.  Thus,  for  the  over  40  years  of  Title  IX’s  existence,  it  has  been \nuniversally understood by schools that receive federal education funding that Title \nIX’s definition of “sex” does not include gender identity. \n233.  It has likewise been universally understood by schools that received \nfederal education funding that maintaining separate restrooms, locker rooms, and \nother private facilities on the basis of biological sex is consistent with Title IX. \n234.  No  school  could  have  possibly  made  an  informed  choice  to  accept \nfederal funding because no school could have known that the funds it agreed to \naccept  were  conditioned  on  allowing  cross-sex  private  facilities,  or  otherwise \nrecognizing gender identity as encompassed within the meaning of “sex.” \n235.  For these reasons, this Court should hold DOE’s actions unlawful, set \naside  its  guidance  documents,  and  enjoin  it,  along  with  DOJ,  from  further \ncommunicating the new rule that “sex” in Title IX includes “gender identity” to any \n38 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 38 of 50\n\nschools, including the University System and those schools maintained by the State \nand its political subdivisions.   \n236.  Additionally,  DOE’s  rule  would  be  unlawful  if  it  were  interpretive, \ninstead  of  legislative,  because  it  would  still  be  contrary  to  constitutional  right, \npower, privilege, or immunity, and so is due to be declared unlawful and set aside. \nD.  DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Without \nObservance of Procedure Required By Law \n \n237.  DOE’s actions were done “without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n238.  As explained above, DOE has promulgated a new rule, unilaterally \ndeclaring that Title IX’s term, “sex,” includes “gender identity,” and that Title IX \nthus prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. \n239.  DOE’s new rule, as enforced by DOJ, also requires schools, including \nthe University System and those schools maintained by the State and its political \nsubdivisions, to allow biological males entry and usage of restrooms and locker \nrooms designated for females, and vice versa. \n240.  Further, DOJ has given this rule the full force of law, investigating \nand enforcing it against the University System and the State.  \n241.  Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  any  “rules  which  do  not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but  which \nestablish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with \nthe APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they initially are \nlabeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n39 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 39 of 50\n\n242.  The Supreme Court has additionally ruled that all legislative rules, \nwhich are those having the force and effect of law and are accorded weight in \nagency  adjudicatory  processes,  must  go  through  the  notice-and-comment \nrequirements. Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1204 (2015). \n243.  Notice-and-comment  rulemaking  requires  that  the  DOE  (1)  issue  a \ngeneral notice to the public of the proposed rule-making, typically by publishing \nnotice in the Federal Register; (2) give interested parties an opportunity to submit \nwritten data, views, or arguments on the proposed rule, and consider and respond to \nsignificant comments received; and (3) include in the promulgation of the final rule \na concise general statement of the rule’s basis and purpose. \n244.  Notice-and-comment rulemaking also requires that the DOE consider \nall the relevant comments offered during the public comment period before finally \ndeciding whether to adopt the proposed rule. \n245.  Additionally,  under  Title  IX,  final  rules,  regulations,  and  orders  of \ngeneral  applicability  issued  by  DOE  must  be  approved  by  the  president  of  the \nUnited States.  \n246.  DOE promulgated and enforced its new rule redefining “sex” in Title \nIX to include gender identity without notice and comment as required by law. 5 \nU.S.C. § 553. It promulgated this new legislative rule without signature by the \npresident as required by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n247.  Simply  stated,  DOE  did  not  follow  the  required  procedure  when  it \nadopted its new rule defining “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender identity.   \n40 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 40 of 50\n\n248.  Because DOE’s rule violates the APA, this Court should declare that \nDOJ cannot lawfully rely upon it as authority for the meaning of “sex” in Title IX.   \nWHEREFORE,  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  respectfully  prays  that  the \nCourt grant the relief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATION THAT MAINTAINING SEX-SPECIFIC RESTROOMS \nAND LOCKER ROOMS DOES NOT VIOLATE TITLE IX \n249.   North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  realleges  all  matters  set  forth  in \nparagraphs 1 through 248 and incorporate them herein. \n250.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n251.  Title IX itself refers to “both sexes,” indicating binary, biological sex. \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2). \n252.  Title IX also refers to “one sex” and “the other sex,” indicating binary, \nbiological sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8). \n253.  Title IX explicitly allows educational institutions to maintain “separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes,” indicating binary, biological sex. 20 U.S.C. § \n1686. \n254.  Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations,  found  at  34  C.F.R.  Part  106, \ncontain many similar, “one sex . . . the other sex” statements, each referring to \nbinary, biological sex. \n41 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 41 of 50\n\n255.  Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations  explicitly  allow  sex-specific \nrestrooms and locker rooms.   \n256.  The implementing regulations state that educational institutions may, \nconsistent with Title IX, “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities \non the basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for students of one sex [are] \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § \n106.33 (emphasis added). \n257.  “[O]ne sex” and “of the other sex” in 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 refers to binary, \nbiological sex. \n258.  Accordingly, DOJ’s Ultimatum, that the University System and those \nschools maintained by the State and its political subdivisions will imminently lose \ntheir federal funding if they retain their sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms, \nviolates the guarantees of Title IX.  \nWHEREFORE,  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  respectfully  prays  that  the \nCourt grant the relief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION  \nDECLARATION THAT DOJ’S RELIANCE ON VAWA \nAS AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ITS ULTIMATUM AND \nVIOLATE PLAINTIFF’S RIGHTS IS MISPLACED \n \n259.  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  realleges  all  matters  set  forth  in \nparagraphs 1 through 258 and incorporate them herein. \n260.  DOJ states in its Letter to the University System that VAWA requires \nthe University System to allow biological males right of entry and use of facilities \ndesignated for females, and vice versa. \n42 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 42 of 50\n\n261.  VAWA requires nothing of the sort. \n262.  VAWA  requires  that  no  one  “be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be \ndenied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or \nactivity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under the [VAWA].” \n42 U.S.C.A. § 13925(13)(A) (emphasis added). \n263.  The programs and activities funded under VAWA include, for example, \n“education programs for the prevention of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault,  and  stalking,”  “programs  providing  legal,  medical,  or  psychological \ncounseling, for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking,” the creation of “data collection and communication systems . . . linking \ncampus  security  to  the  local  law  enforcement,  and  the  distribution  of  “print  or \nelectronic  materials  to  address  both  prevention  and  intervention  in  domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual violence, and stalking.” 42 U.S.C. § 14045b(b). \n264.  VAWA  funding  does  not  specifically  include  policies  or  programs \nregulating access to bathrooms.  \n265.  Thus,  VAWA  is  inapposite,  and  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  it  for  its \nUltimatum to the University System is misplaced. \n266.  Additionally, similar to Title IX, VAWA has an express carve-out for \n“sex segregation” and “sex-specific programming” that “is necessary to the essential \noperation of a program.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 13925(13)(B). \n267.  The statute provides in relevant part, “If sex segregation or sex-specific \nprogramming is necessary to the essential operation of a program, nothing in this \n43 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 43 of 50\n\nparagraph shall prevent any such program or activity from consideration of an \nindividual’s sex.” Id.  It continues: “In such circumstances, grantees may meet the \nrequirements of this paragraph by providing comparable services to individuals who \ncannot be provided with the sex-segregated or sex-specific programming.” Id. \n268.  Because  of  constitutional  privacy  and  free  exercise  concerns, \nseparation  by  biological  sex  is  “necessary  to  the  essential  operation”  of  the \nUniversity System’s restrooms and locker rooms.   \n269.  Because  of  statutory  Title  IX  and  RFRA  concern,  separation  by \nbiological sex is “necessary to the essential operation” of the University System’s \nrestrooms and locker rooms.    \n270.  Because of safety concerns, separation by biological sex is “necessary to \nthe essential operation” of the University System’s restrooms and locker rooms.   \n271.  These same concerns undergird the need for the State and its political \nsubdivisions to be able to provide sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms in its \nschools. \n272.    Because  separation  by  biological  sex  is  necessary  to  the  essential \noperation  of  the  University  System’s  restrooms  and  locker  rooms,  and  because \nVAWA  therefore  allows  such  separation,  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  VAWA  for  its \nUltimatum to the University System is misplaced. \n273.  Additionally,  the  University  System’s  practice  of  maintaining \nrestrooms and locker rooms separated by biological sex does not discriminate based \non gender identity. \n44 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 44 of 50\n\n274.  The University System forbids all biological males, regardless of their \ngender identity, from using restrooms or locker rooms designated for females. \n275.  The  University  System  similarly  forbids  all  biological  females, \nregardless of their gender identity, from using restrooms or locker rooms designated \nfor males.  \n276.  The  University  System  therefore  does  not  discriminate  based  on \ngender identity, but treats all biological males the same, and all biological females \nthe same. \n277.  Ironically, DOJ’s Ultimatum to the University System would require \nthe University to engage in gender-identity discrimination. \n278.  DOJ’s  Ultimatum  seeks  to  compel  the  University  System  to  allow \nsome, but not all, biological males the right of entry and use of female restrooms and \nlocker rooms. \n279.  The determining factor between the males who would be allowed such \nright of entry and use, and those who would be denied it, is their gender identity.  \n280.  Similarly, DOJ’s Ultimatum seeks to compel the University System to \nallow  some,  but  not  all,  biological  females  the  right  of  entry  and  use  of  male \nrestrooms and locker rooms. \n281.  The determining factor between the females who would be allowed \nsuch right of entry and use, and those who would be denied it, is their gender \nidentity.  \n45 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 45 of 50\n\n282.  So,  under  DOJ’s  Ultimatum,  those  biological  males  whose  gender \nidentity  is  female  would  be  allowed  access  to  the  female  restrooms  and  locker \nrooms, but those biological males whose gender identity is male would be denied \nsuch access. \n283.  And, under DOJ’s Ultimatum, those biological females whose gender \nidentity is male would be allowed access to the male restrooms and locker rooms, \nbut those biological females whose gender identity is female would be denied such \naccess. \n284.  The result just described would be impermissible discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity, because it would make a biological male student’s gender \nidentity the determining factor for whether he could access the female facilities, and \nvice versa.  \n285.  The University System’s policy, which forbids all biological males from \nentering and using the female facilities, regardless of the biological males’ gender \nidentity,  and  forbids  all  biological  females  from  entering  and  using  the  male \nfacilities,  regardless  gender  identity,  does  not  engage  in  gender  identity \ndiscrimination, but rather treats all persons the same, regardless of their gender \nidentity.  \n286.  Thus,  VAWA  is  inapposite,  and  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  it  for  its \nUltimatum to the University System is misplaced. \n287.  Additionally, the definition of gender identity that VAWA incorporates \nis found in the federal “hate crimes act.” \n46 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 46 of 50\n\n288.  The  hate  crimes  act  is  concerned  with  people  attacking  a  victim \nbecause the victim’s dress or hair style does not conform to what people typically \nassociate with the victim’s sex. \n289.  In other words, the hate crimes act is concerned with gender identity \nin the sense of gender stereotyping (i.e., when a man is attacked because he is not \nmasculine enough, or a woman is attacked because she is not feminine enough). \n290.  “Gender  identity”  in  the  hate  crimes  act  does  not  contemplate \nsituations where one does not perceive himself as being his biological sex.   \n291.  Accordingly, DOJ’s interpretation of VAWA is not required by the hate \ncrimes act.   \n292.  Neither the hate crimes act nor VAWA require the University System \nor the State to allow students to use opposite-sex restrooms and locker rooms. \n293.  Neither the hate crimes act nor VAWA forbid the University System or \nthe State from maintaining sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms. \n294.  Thus,  VAWA  is  inapposite,  and  DOJ’s  reliance  upon  it  for  its \nUltimatum to the State and the University System is misplaced. \nWHEREFORE,  North  Carolinians  for  Privacy  respectfully  prays  that  the \nCourt grant the relief set forth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, North Carolinians for Privacy respectfully prays for judgment \nas follows and requests the following relief: \n47 \nCase 5:16-cv-00245-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/10/16   Page 47 of 50\n\nA.  That this Court declare that the Department of Education’s new rule, \nthat redefines the word “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender identity, and \nupon which the Department of Justice relies in issuing its Ultimatum to the State \nand  University,  violates  the  provisions  and  requirements  of  the  Administrative \nProcedure  Act  and  so  is  unlawful  and  unenforceable,  by  the  Department  of \nEducation as well as the Department of Justice; and, that this Court declare that \nthe Department of Justice and the Department of Education cannot rely upon an \nunlawful rule for purposes of determining the requirements of Title IX (Count I); \nB.

The goal of these motions is to create one omnibus case including another case also\nchallenging purported federal overreach in the regulation of those same facilities, McCrory v. United\nStates, 5:16-CV-238-BO (E.D.N.C. 2016) (“McCrory”).  On June 21, 2016, a telephonic hearing and\nRule 16 status conference was held in Berger and NCFP; counsel in McCrory also attended.\nBACKGROUND\nA. The Ordinance and Legislative Response\nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte, North Carolina, City Council voted to approve “An\nOrdinance Amending Chapter 2 of the Charlotte City Code Entitled ‘Administration’, Chapter 12\nEntitled ‘Human Relations’, and Chapter 22 Entitled ‘Vehicles for Hire,’” unofficially designated\nby the city as the “Non-Discrimination Ordinance” (the “Ordinance”).  See http://charmeck.org/city/\ncharlotte/CityClerk/Documents/NDOrdinance.pdf (last visited June 29, 2016).  As relevant here, the\nOrdinance added to the city’s then-existing prohibition on discrimination protections for persons\ndiscriminated against on the basis of “gender identity [or] gender expression.”  Id. § 1.  It also\nrepealed certain pre-existing provisions of the Charlotte City Code allowing businesses to restrict\non the basis of biological sex access to “[r]estrooms, shower rooms, bathhouses and similar facilities\n2\n\nwhich are in their nature distinctly private.”  Id. § 3.  Thus, by its terms, the Ordinance allowed\ntransgender persons, that is, those who identify with a sex different from their biological sex\nassigned at birth, to use the restroom or shower facility that corresponds with their gender identity. \nThe Ordinance was scheduled to go into effect April 1, 2016.\nAlmost immediately, the Ordinance drew criticism from North Carolina Governor Pat\nMcCrory, members of the state’s legislature, and some members of the public.  Opponents argued\nthat the Ordinance swept far more broadly than the Charlotte City Council had intended and\npotentially could have negative consequences.  On February 23, 2016, Speaker Moore, one of the\nOrdinance’s opponents, vowed “to correct this radical course.”  Steve Harrison & Jim Morrill, After\nLGBT Vote, NC House Speaker Says Lawmakers Will ‘Correct This Radical Course’, Charlotte\nObserver,  Feb.  23,  2016,  available  at  http://  www.charlotteobserver.com/news/\npolitics-government/article61932507.html (last visited June 29, 2016).  On March 22, 2016, Speaker\nMoore and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, President of the North Carolina Senate,\ncalled both houses of the legislature into special session to address the Ordinance.\nFollowing a one-day special session, held March 23, 2016, the state legislature passed\nSession Law 2016-3, titled “An Act to Provide for Single-Sex Multiple Occupancy Bathroom and\nChanging Facilities in Schools and Public Agencies and to Create Statewide Consistency in\nRegulation of Employment and Public Accommodations,” commonly known either as the “Public\nFacilities Privacy and Security Act,” or “HB2” (the “Act”).  See H.B. 2, 2016 Sess. L. 3 (N.C.\n2016).  Section 1 of the Act, which is the most relevant section for purposes of these lawsuits, targets\ndirectly  Charlotte’s  Ordinance.    It  requires  “local  boards  of  education”  and  “public\naccommodations” to adhere to a single sex, multiple occupancy bathroom policy, with “sex” defined\n3\n\nas “biological” or “physical” sex as “stated on a person’s birth certificate.”  See id. §§ 1.2 & 1.3; see\nalso id. § 1.1.  Other provisions of the Act preempt local government control over the minimum\nwage, id. § 2.1; the power of local government to condition contracts with private parties on certain\nconditions or employment practices inconsistent with state law, id. §§ 2.2 & 2.3; and local\ndiscrimination ordinances.  See id. §§ 3.1 & 3.3.  Governor McCrory signed the Act into law on the\nMarch 23, 2016, session date.1 \nB. Subsequent Litigation\nThe Act has been met both with ire and praise.  On March 28, 2016, one of the groups\nexpressing displeasure, the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.  See Carcaño v. McCrory,\n1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP (M.D.N.C. 2016)  (“Carcaño”).  Carcaño was brought, among others, on\nbehalf of Joaquín Carcaño and Payton McGarry, persons born biologically female but who live their\nlives as males.  As alleged, Carcaño and McGarry were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have\nreceived hormone therapy to assist in the treatment of their medical condition.  \nAccording to the complaint, aside from hormone therapy, treatment for gender dysphoria\nrequires use of single-sex restroom and locker room facilities consistent with one’s gender identity. \nCarcaño and McGarry allege that they will be damaged as a result of the Act’s biological sex\nrestriction on state-operated bathroom and shower facilities.  See Carcaño, 1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP\n(DE 1, ¶¶28–33; 41; 45–53; 64–66; 72–82). \n1  Thereafter, on April 12, 2016, Governor McCrory signed Executive Order 93, implementing the substantive\nprovisions of the Act.  See Executive Order No. 93: To Protect Privacy and Equality (Apr. 12, 2016), available at https://\nncgovernor.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/documents/files/McCrory%20EO%2093_0.pdf (last visited June 29, 2016). \n4\n\nThe Carcaño plaintiffs assert a variety of claims against Governor McCrory; Roy Cooper,\nthe North Carolina Attorney General; the University of North Carolina; the Board of Governors of\nthe University of North Carolina; and Louis Bissette, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Governors.  As\nrelevant here, the Carcaño plaintiffs allege that § 1 of the Act violates on its face the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  In particular, they allege that § 1 classifies people on the\nbasis of their sex, gender identity, and transgender status, and treats transgender people different\nthan similarly situated people who are not transgender.   \nIn addition, Carcaño, an employee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and\nMcGarry, a student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, allege that § 1 of Act violates\non its face their rights under Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.  In particular, they allege that by limiting bathroom, changing facility, and\nshower facility access along the lines of biological sex, defendants have denied them benefits “on\nthe basis of sex”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The Carcaño plaintiffs also raise a number of Constitutional\nclaims not relevant here.2\nC. Determination Letters\nNotwithstanding Carcaño, the state proceeded to implement the Act.  Those efforts were met\nwith hostility from the United States.  For example, on April 5, 2016, the University of North\nCarolina, through its president, Margaret Spellings, publically indicated that the university system\nwould comply with the Act.  In reaction to that guidance, the United States Department of Education\n2  For example, they allege that § 1 of the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause\nbecause it discriminates against homosexuals on the basis of sexual orientation; §§ 2 and 3 of the Act violate the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by preempting local non-discrimination ordinances; and that the Act\nas a whole violates the substantive aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by violating their\nfundamental rights to privacy and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n5\n\n(“USDOE”) requested information for the purpose of determining whether the university system,\na recipient of federal funds, was in compliance with Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act\n(the “VAWA”), 42 U.S.C. § 13701 through § 14040.  Previously, the USDOE had interpreted Title\nIX and its associated regulations with the purpose of including transgender individuals within the\nstatute’s reach, at least with respect to bathroom access.  See generally G.G. ex rel. Grimm v.\nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., __ F.3d__, 2016 WL 1567467 (4th Cir. 2016).\nOn May 4, 2016, the United States Department of Justice (“USDOJ”) issued a series of three\n“determination  letters”  respectively  to  Governor  McCrory;  Secretary  of  the  North  Carolina\nDepartment of Public Safety, Frank Perry; and President Spellings.  All three letters are to the same\neffect: § 1 of the Act violates federal law.  The letter directed to Governor McCrory concludes that\n§ 1 of the Act violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\nseq, on its face.  The letter to Secretary Perry likewise concludes that § 1 of the Act facially violates\nboth Title VII and the VAWA.  Finally, the letter directed toward President Spellings likewise\nconcludes that § 1 of the Act facially violates both Title IX and the VAWA.  The United States gave\neach recipient up to and including May 9, 2016, to “remedy” their respective violations of federal\nlaw or risk losing federal funding.\nD. Initiation of Litigation Following Carcaño\nComing on the heels of Carcaño are three related federal lawsuits filed May 9, 2016.  One\nwas filed in the Middle District and two were filed in this district.  A fourth related case was filed\nin this district on the following day.\n6\n\n1. McCrory\nAt 8:31 a.m. on May 9, 2016, Governor McCrory and Secretary Perry filed McCrory in this\ndistrict, assigned to another judge.  See 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 1).  Named as defendants are the\nUnited States of America; the USDOJ; Loretta Lynch, in her official capacity as United States\nAttorney General; and Vanita Gupta, in her official capacity as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney\nGeneral.  The McCrory plaintiffs seek a declaration that the state is “in compliance with Title VII”\nunder the text of that statute.  Id. (DE 1 at 8).  In addition, they seek a declaration that the state is\n“in compliance with [the] VAWA,” which they assume “specifically includes gender identity as a\nprotected class.”  Id. (DE 1 at 8–9).\n2.  United States\nAt 3:16 p.m. on May 9, 2016, the United States of America filed suit in the Middle District. \nSee United States v. North Carolina, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (M.D.N.C. 2016) (the “United States”\ncase).  Defendants in that case are the State of North Carolina; Governor McCrory, the North\nCarolina Department of Public Safety; the University of North Carolina; and its Board of Governors. \nThe United States seeks a declaration that § 1 of the Act violates Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA.\n3. Berger\nAlso on May 9, 2006, eight minutes after United States was filed in the Middle District, and\nabout seven hours after McCrory was filed here, Senator Berger and Speaker Moore filed Berger. \nSeparate and apart from McCrory, Berger develops additional theories challenging the validity of\nthe USDOJ’s interpretative position.  For example, as Berger relates to Title VII, the Berger\nplaintiffs allege that § 1 of the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and that the\nterm “sex” does not include gender identity.  Second, they allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation\n7\n\nof Title VII, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, runs afoul of Section Five of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, because the remedy it provides is not “congruent and proportional” relative to the\ndiscrimination it seeks to prevent.  Third, the Berger plaintiffs allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation\nof Title VII, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, violates a number of principles related to\nfederalism and the separation of powers, including the Commerce Clause, Spending Clause,\nPresentment Clause, and the Tenth Amendment.  Finally, they allege that, even if § 1 of the Act\nviolates Title VII in some instances, it cannot be facially invalid where it has at least one possible,\npermissible application. \nBerger also raises concerns in response to the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title IX and the\nVAWA, also not at issue in McCrory.  In the context of Title IX, the Berger plaintiffs allege that § 1\nof the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and that the term “sex” does not\ninclude gender identity.  Second, they allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title IX, even if\nvalid in light of the statute’s text, was promulgated in violation of the notice-and-comment rule\nmaking procedure required by the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq.,\nbecause,  notwithstanding  the  USDOJ’s  position  to  the  contrary,  the  rule  announced  was\n“substantive” or “legislative,” as opposed to merely “interpretative.”  5 U.S.C. § 553.  Third, the\nBerger plaintiffs interpose a host of Constitutional claims targeting the USDOJ’s interpretation of\nTitle IX, including that the USDOJ’s interpretation of that statute and its regulations violates the\nfederalism principles embodied in the Tenth Amendment; violates the Spending Clause; and requires\nthe state to violate both its citizens’ fundamental right to bodily privacy and parents’ fundamental\nliberty interest in directing the education and upbringing of their children, at least with respect to\nmatters of sexuality.  Finally, at least with respect to Title IX, they allege that, under the USDOJ’s\n8\n\ninterpretation of Title IX, § 1 of the Act still has some permissible applications and, therefore, is not\nfacially invalid. \nIn the context of the VAWA, the Berger plaintiffs similarly allege that § 1 of the Act does\nnot violate the VAWA because it does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity, but rather\non the basis of biological sex, a consideration, they submit, that clearly is permissible under the\nVAWA, and, in all events, that the term “sex” does not include gender identity.  Second, they also\nallege that the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, is\ninconsistent with the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious, where the USDOJ implemented it\nwithout considering fully the consequences of that interpretation, and otherwise not in accordance\nwith the law, where that interpretation violates the USDOJ’s own regulations, the “Prison Rape\nElimination Act National Standards, ” 15 C.F.R. § 115.5 et seq.  Third, the Berger plaintiffs allege\nthat the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA violates Tenth Amendment’s federalism principles,\nviolates the Spending Clause, and requires the state to violate the Eighth Amendment rights of its\ninmates.  Finally, they allege that § 1 of the Act, even if it violates the VAWA in some instances,\ndoes not violate the VAWA on its face, because it does not violate the VAWA in all instances.\n4. NCFP\nOne day later, on May 10, 2016, NCFP filed NCFP in this district.  Like Berger, NCFP was\nassigned to this judge.  Unlike McCory, and like Berger in part, NCFP centers on Title IX.  Also like\nBerger, NCFP raises other, different issues for decision also not embraced by McCrory. \nNCFP seeks a declaration that the USDOE’s interpretation of Title IX, as adopted by the\nUSDOJ, is inconsistent with the text of the statute and violates the APA, a federal statute, and the\nConstitution.  First, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX runs contrary\n9\n\nto the text of the relevant statute and regulations, because the term “sex” is unambiguous and may\nnot be interpreted to include gender identity. \nSecond, NCFP alleges that, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, the United States’s\ninterpretation of Title IX violates the APA where it was promulgated without observing the APA’s\nnotice-and-comment  rule  making  procedures.    Likewise,  it  alleges  that  the  United  States’s\ninterpretation of Title IX violates the APA where it is arbitrary and capricious because the USDOE,\nand by proxy the USDOJ, did not engage in reasoned decision making when adopting its\ninterpretation; failed to consider potential negative consequences of mixing the biological sexes in\nbathrooms, shower facilities, and the like; and failed to explain appropriately its actions. \nThird, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX, even if valid in light\nof the statute’s text, violates a federal statute and certain Constitutional provisions.  In particular,\nNCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX violates the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., because it substantially burdens the organization’s\nmembers’ sincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity and does not further a\ncompelling government interest.  Likewise, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of\nTitle  IX  violates  the  organization’s  members’  Fourteenth  Amendment  rights,  including  the\nfundamental right to privacy and the fundamental liberty interest in directing the education and\nupbringing of one’s child; violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause; and violates the\nSpending Clause. \nIn addition, NCFP seeks a declaration that § 1 of the Act does not violate Title IX, that § 1\nof the Act does not violate the VAWA, and, in all events, the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA\n10\n\nexceeds the VAWA’s regulatory mandate.  NCFP also requests an injunction, prohibiting the United\nStates from stripping the state’s federal funding pending disposition of its case.\nE. Subsequent Litigation Developments\n1. Carcaño \nCarcaño  has  progressed  substantially  and  now  presents  issues  concerning  USDOJ’s\ninterpretation of Title IX as it relates to that statute’s text, the procedure employed by the USDOJ\nin interpreting the statute, and the validity of the USDOJ’s interpretation in light of other substantive\nprovisions of law.  On May 25, 2016, the Berger plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene in Carcaño. \n1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP (DE 33).  Their motion to intervene was granted June 6, 2016.  Id. (DE 44). \nOn June 9, 2016, the Berger plaintiffs answered the complaint and interposed counterclaims against\nthe Carcaño plaintiffs.  Id. (DE 54).  \nAs relevant here, the Berger plaintiffs now assert in Carcaño a claim against the Carcaño\nplaintiffs for a declaration that § 1 of the Act does not violate on its face the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  In addition, they request a declaration that § 1 of the Act\ndoes not violate Title IX, or, in the alternative, that the Carcaño plaintiffs’ interpretation of Title IX\nviolates the federal Constitution.   \nIn the meantime, the Carcaño parties, including the Berger plaintiffs and Governor McCrory,\nnearly have completed briefing on a motion for preliminary injunction.  Id. (DE 21; DE 22; DE 27;\nDE 55; DE 61; DE 73).  That motion seeks to enjoin Governor McCrory, as well as other\ndefendants, from enforcing § 1 of the Act.\n11\n\n2. United States\nUnited States presents for decision nearly the full complement of issues presented in this\ndistrict in McCrory, Berger, and NCFP.  The Berger plaintiffs moved to intervene in United States\non May 17, 2016.  The Berger plaintiffs declared in United States in furtherance of their motion to\nintervene similarity of issues raised here: “[O]n the same day the [USDOJ] sued in this District, the\nProposed Intervenors filed their own declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of North\nCarolina, raising multiple questions of law and fact nearly identical to questions raised by the\nDepartment  –  questions  which,  moreover,  are  raised  in  the  pleading  accompanying  this\nintervention.”  United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE 9 at 6).  Likewise, on June 28, 2016,\nNCFP moved to intervene in United States.  Id. (DE 58).  In support of its motion, NCFP attests to\nthe similarity between NCFP and United States: “NCFP has a pending action in the Eastern District\nof North Carolina involving some of the same legal issues at stake in this case.”  Id. (DE 59 at 6). \nThat case also includes challenges by Governor McCrory, through the vehicle of affirmative\ndefenses, to the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA in light of the text of\nthose statutes, the procedures employed by the USDOJ in interpreting those statutes, and other\nsubstantive  provisions  of  law.    Id.  (DE  32).    Moreover,  Governor  McCrory  asserts  two\ncounterclaims that are identical to his principal claims in McCrory.  Id. (DE 32). \nUnited States has progressed, too, on claim for injunctive relief.  On June 10, 2016, the\nUnited States parties filed a joint motion for injunctive relief, raising the time-sensitive issue of\nwhether or not certain federal funds made available to defendants under the VAWA should be\nsuspended, a concern implicit also in Berger and NCFP.  By order entered June 23, 2016, the court\ngranted the parties’ joint motion, holding that “while entertaining serious concerns about the\n12\n\npositions taken by the parties and the court’s authority to enter an injunction under the circumstances\nof this case, the court finds that, in the absence of clear authority to the contrary and in light of the\nsubstantial harm that suspension of funding in question would inflict on wholly innocent third\nparties, the court will grant the motion preliminarily.”  Id. (DE 53 at 1).  \n3. Related Eastern District of North Carolina Cases\nOn May 17, 2016, the McCrory plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to transfer their case\nto the Middle District.  There, they pointed out that United States had been, for all intents and\npurposes, filed contemporaneously with McCrory.  In addition, they pointed out that Carcaño, filed\nnearly two months earlier, raises similar issues and has been assigned to the same United States\nDistrict Judge.  The McCrory plaintiffs argued that a transfer to the Middle District would “greatly\nenhance efficiency for the parties and the public while avoiding piecemeal litigation and reducing\ninconvenience to the witnesses.”  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 10 at 6).\nThereafter, on May 23, 2016, the instant motions to consolidate were filed in Berger and\nNCFP.  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 7); NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE 12).  The Berger plaintiffs\nargue that decision on their motion seeking to consolidate should come first, before any decision on\nthe McCrory plaintiffs’ consent motion to transfer.  “[B]ecause McCrory and this case are obviously\nrelated, the proper course is first to consolidate the two cases before making any decision about\nwhether or not to transfer them to the Middle District.”  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 8 at 6). \nGrabbing hold of the “interested party” role designation in the court’s electronic case filing\nsystem (“CM/ECF”), without leave or the making of any motion to intervene, the Berger plaintiffs\ncatapulted themselves in the McCrory case.  There, they filed a motion to consolidate identical to\n13\n\nthe one they previously had filed in the Berger case.  Id. (DE 7); McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE\n11).  \nThe McCrory plaintiffs followed suit, adopting CM/ECF’s “interested party” label  and, also\nwithout leave or the making of any motion to intervene, filed a response in Berger in support of the\nBerger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate Berger with McCrory, on the condition however that any\nconsolidation not “in any way impede[] or interfere[] with the transfer of [McCrory] to the Middle\nDistrict.”  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 13 at 2).  In the Berger case, defendants’ response to the\nmotion to consolidate was not due until on or before June 16, 2016. \nOn May 24, 2016, one day after the Berger plaintiffs filed their motion before this court,\nNCFP filed in NCFP its motion to consolidate NCFP with McCrory.  NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE\n12).  NCFP, like the Berger plaintiffs, put itself on the docket in the McCrory case where on May\n24, 2016, as an “interested party” in CM/ECF,  it filed an identical motion to consolidate NCFP and\nMcCrory.  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 22).  \nInto the muddied case waters the Berger defendants had not yet waded.  As noted, their\nresponse to the motion to consolidate in the Berger case before the undersigned was not due to be\nmade until on or before June 16, 2016. \nIn the meantime, on May 23, 2016, the judge assigned to McCrory announced he would\ndecide the “interested party” Berger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate before addressing the McCrory\nplaintiffs’ consent motion to transfer.  Id. (May 23, 2016, text order).  On May 26, 2016, the judge\nassigned to McCrory stated that the final decision on consolidation rests with the judge to whom the\ncase is assigned, announcing  that consolidation of McCrory and Berger “will be allowed if\npermitted by the judge to whom [Berger] is currently assigned.”  Id. (DE 32 at 1–2).  On June 7,\n14\n\n2016, as the Berger plaintiffs’ instant motion to consolidate was ripening before the undersigned,\nthe judge assigned to McCrory denied the McCrory plaintiff’s consent motion to transfer.  McCrory,\n5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 34).  \nOn June 13, 2016, three days before the Berger defendants’ response to the Berger plaintiff’s\ninstant motion to consolidate was due to be filed in the above-captioned case, the judge assigned to\nMcCrory again suggested, by separate order, that Berger and McCrory would be consolidated. \nId. (DE 36).  On June 15, 2016, two days before the NCFP defendants’ response was due in NCFP,\nthe undersigned set these cases before her for hearing on the motions to consolidate and for Rule 16\nstatus conference for June 21, 2016.  On June 20, 2016, one day before that hearing and conference,\nthe judge assigned to McCrory suggested in separate order that NCFP also would be consolidated\nwith McCory.3 Id. (DE 43). \n3  The undersigned has waited for the separate response deadlines to expire before ruling on the instant motions\nto consolidate in Berger and NCFP.  It appears, however, that during that time confusion has developed in the clerk’s\noffice and among the litigants as to the status of these cases.  For example, the Berger plaintiffs having entered McCory\nand filed there their motion to consolidate pending before the undersigned triggered  discourse with the McCory\nplaintiffs, who responded separately on May 25, 2016.  The next day, a “court only” flag prematurely was triggered by\nthe McCrory case manager stating “Replies due by 6/13/16,” seemingly depriving the Berger defendants of their\nopportunity timely to respond in this case, which period did not elapse until June 16, 2016.  On June 14, 2016, after\nsuggested ruling on the motion in McCrory the day before, defendants in NCFP filed response in opposition to\nconsolidation, wherein they misapprehended significance of  suggested ruling in McCrory.  There can be no\nconsolidation of two cases assigned different judges until the judge assigned to the case to be consolidated relinquishes\nher authority over it.  See Vorel v. Johns, No. 5:10-CT-3005-FL, 2010 WL 4735829, at *1 (E.D.N.C. Nov. 15, 2010). \nAs the judges of this court have noted, that much should be plain.  The consolidation of cases assigned to multiple judges\nnecessarily entails the reassignment of the case to be consolidated from one judge to the other.  Without orderly rules\nand procedures to govern consolidation, and, by proxy, reassignment, a party’s indiscriminately filed motion to\nconsolidate might invite dereliction of the carefully constructed system used to distribute cases between the judges of\na district.  To make it even plainer that final decision on motions in cases assigned to me rests with me, to promote\nefficiencies sought after by all parties, where the nature of this litigation has been made more complex in no small part\nby the parties’ own strategic litigation decisions, and given the practical difficulties arising for the clerk’s office in\neffective case management, the court set hearing and Rule 16 status conference in these cases June 15, 2016, by\ntelephone for June 21, 2016. \n15\n\nCOURT’S DISCUSSION\nA. Motions to Consolidate Berger and NCFP with McCrory\nThe court denies the instant motions to consolidate Berger and NCFP with McCrory. \nGranting those motions would impede the efficient administration of justice.  There exists a more\ndirect path to final resolution of the central question presented in all five actions, the validity of the\nAct under federal Constitutional and statutory law, which question encompasses all of the other\nissues raised by the McCrory plaintiffs, the Berger plaintiffs, and NCFP. \n“If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may . . . join\nfor hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions; . . . consolidate the actions; or . . . issue\nany other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).  In ruling on a motion\nto consolidate the “critical question” is whether the case presents “specific risks of prejudice and\npossible confusion” and, if so, the magnitude of those risks relative to the “risk of inconsistent\nadjudications on common factual and legal issues, the burden on parties, witnesses and available\njudicial resources posed by multiple lawsuits, the length of time required to conclude multiple suits\nas against a single one, and the relative expense to all concerned of the single-trial, multiple-trial\nalternatives.”  Arnold v. E. Air Lines, Inc., 681 F.2d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 1982), reh’g granted and\nrev’d on other grounds, 712 F.2d 899 (4th Cir. 1983) (en banc). \nIn the usual case, consolidation would be warranted.  The risk of inconsistent adjudication\nis high and the relative expense of multiple proceedings, as compared to a single proceeding, is\nplain.  As to the risk of inconsistent adjudication, the similar substantive and procedural issues raised\nby McCrory, Berger, and NCFP are presented now through the vehicle of five different cases,\nincluding Carcaño and United States, assigned to three different district judges over the span of two\n16\n\ndistricts.  The very fact that these cases are presented to isolated decision makers raises beyond the\nspeculative level the fear of inconsistent adjudications.  That threat is even more real in light of the\nfact that each case presents a collection of substantively identical claims along side different, but\nrelated claims. \nNotwithstanding the above, the court declines the parties’ invitation to consolidate either\nBerger or NCFP with McCrory on the unique circumstances presented.  Considering only the three\ncases pending in this district, it is abundantly clear that the true center of gravity around which this\ndispute lies is presented to the undersigned, rendering consolidation with the less rigorous McCrory\ninappropriate.\nBerger and NCFP present a more robust challenge to the United States’s interpretative\nposition.  The Berger plaintiffs and NCFP attack the USDOJ’s interpretative guidance through three\navenues.  First, they each raises a textual argument, alleging that the USDOJ’s interpretation is\nimpermissible in light of Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA’s text.  Second, they each raises\nprocedural issues, alleging that, even if the USDOJ’s interpretation of the relevant statutes is\npermissible under the text of those statutes, that said interpretation was promulgated in violation of\nthe APA.  Finally, they each raises a substantive, independent legal challenge to the USDOJ’s\ninterpretative guidance.  In particular, the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP all allege that the USDOJ’s\ninterpretation of Title VII, Title IX, or the VAWA violates numerous provisions of the Constitution. \nThe McCrory plaintiffs, by contrast, limit their challenge to the text of the relevant statute.  For\nexample, they request a declaration that the state is in compliance with the VAWA, assuming that\nthe VAWA “specifically includes gender identity as a protected class.”  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO\n(DE 1 at 8–9). Thus, consolidation with the less rigorous McCrory is inappropriate.\n17\n\nConsolidation of Berger and NCFP with McCrory also is inappropriate where it would defy\nthe mandate of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 1.  The court must “construe[], administer[], and\nemploy[] [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] . . . to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive\ndetermination of every action and proceeding.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Consolidation of the cases now\npending in this district falters on that goal, where it provides only temporary relief to a long-term\nproblem.  Even if the court were to consolidate these cases, there still is a risk of inconsistent and\nexpensive parallel proceedings where similar actions remain pending in the Middle District and no\nparty seems ready to accept a stay in any case.  In fact, the Berger plaintiffs recently have confirmed\nthat, in the absence of some kind of single-district solution, they would continue to press their\nposition in both the Eastern and Middle Districts.  See United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE\n50 at 1–3).  A transfer best accomplishes Rule 1’s goal.\nB. Court’s Sua Sponte Transfer of Berger and NCFP\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court may transfer a case to any other district\n“where it might have been brought” if such transfer is determined in the court’s discretion to be “for\nthe convenience of the parties and witnesses [and] in the interest of justice.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). \nThe district court may consider the possibility of transfer sua sponte.  Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d 722,\n729 n.7 (4th Cir. 1986).\nIn exercising its discretion to transfer a case, the court is guided by a number of factors,\nincluding consideration of practical solutions of administrative efficiency that might make the\nproceedings easy, expeditious, and inexpensive.  See Plant Genetic Sys., N.V. v. Ciba Seeds, 933\nF. Supp. 519, 527 (M.D.N.C. 1996).  In addition, where similar law suits have been filed in multiple\nfederal forums, the first-filed suit usually should have priority, “absent the showing of balance of\n18\n\nconvenience in favor of the second action.”  Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co.,\n386 F.3d 581, 594–95 (4th Cir. 2004); Ellicot Mach. Corp. v. Modern Welding Co., 502 F.2d 178,\n180 (4th Cir. 1974).  To determine whether a case is the “first filed” the court looks to 1) the\nchronology of the filings, 2) the similarity of the parties, and 3) the similarity of the issues at stake. \nNutrition & Fitness, Inc. v. Blue Stuff, Inc., 264 F. Supp. 2d 357, 360 (W.D.N.C. 2003); see also\nAllied-Gen. Nuclear Servs. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 675 F.2d 610, 611 n.1 (4th Cir. 1982);\nCarbide & Carbon Chems. Corp. v. U.S. Indus. Chems., 140 F.2d 47, 49 (4th Cir. 1944). \nAs a threshold matter, both Berger and NCFP could have been brought in the Middle\nDistrict.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), where a plaintiff sues an agency or officer of the United\nStates, venue may be laid in any judicial district where “a substantial part of the events or omissions\ngiving rise to the claim occurred.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).  A significant portion of the events giving\nrise to the claims at issue occurred in the Middle District. If the United States were to pull federal\nfunding from schools, universities, and the prison system, among other things, the effect of that\naction would be felt wide, including in the Middle District.  In fact, the court in that district already\nhas addressed this issue, preliminarily, for the benefit of the State of North Carolina.\nHere, the “interest of justice” favors a transfer of the Berger and NCFP cases to the Middle\nDistrict.  Both the “first-filed” rule and considerations of administrative efficiency counsel in favor\nof that result.  First, Carcaño was the first-filed case and is owed a degree of deference.  That case\nchallenges § 1 of the Act under Title IX.  The Title IX claim raised by the Carcaño plaintiffs is the\nmirror image of the Title IX claims raised by the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP.  They raise common\nquestions concerning the validity of the Act under a federal statute.  In many ways, the claims\npresented by the Carcaño plaintiffs on the one hand, and the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP, on the\n19\n\nother, are two sides of the same coin; the Constitutional and statutory claims asserted by the Berger\nplaintiffs and NCFP with respect to Title IX respond directly to and could be asserted in defense to\nthe Carcaño plaintiffs’ Title IX claim.  \nAlthough the Berger plaintiffs also raise Title VII and VAWA claims, the conceptual\ndifference between a fully and thoroughly litigated Title IX claim, as compared to a Title VII and\nVAWA claim is minimal because the relevant language in each statute is substantively identical;\neach claim likely will turn on the same or similar analysis.  See Jennings v. Univ. of N.C., 482 F.3d\n686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) (courts look to Title VII to interpret Title IX); Braden v. Piggly Wiggly,\n4 F. Supp. 2d 1357 1361 (M.D. Ala. 1998) (“The legislative history also reveals that Congress\nintended the language of the VAWA to mirror that of Title VII.”).  Thus, the structural similarity\nbetween the three cases is a persuasive basis upon which to ground a transfer. \nHowever, the court recognizes that Carcaño is not a perfect analogue of either Berger or\nNCFP.  In particular, Carcaño challenges the Constitutionality of the Act directly, while Berger and\nNCFP challenge only the USDOJ’s interpretation of several federal statutes.  Even though these\ncases are not perfectly analogous, the totality of the circumstances suggests they should be tried\ntogether, or at least on a unified schedule before one judge.  As an initial matter, § 1404 does not\nrequire a one-to-one correspondence of issues.  In addition, although the issues raised in both cases\ncertainly are unique, the court views them in their larger context.  All of the issues presented\nbetween Berger, NCFP, and Carcaño bear on a common question, whether the Act survives in the\nface of federal law.  Thus, the court considers Carcaño to be the first filed and will defer to it.\nIn any case, the joint administration of Berger and NCFP alongside Carcaño and United\nStates will accrue significant administrative and financial benefits to all interested parties.  As to\n20\n\nadministrative benefits, the litigants will receive substantial benefit of having one judge control all\nfour cases, and with them all substantive issues related to the validity of the Act under federal\nConstitutional and statutory law.  That will allow a single decision maker to render timely decisions\nand coordinate deadlines between the parties.  Moreover, the public will experience a significant\nbenefit from the joint administration of these cases.  The undersigned makes no forecast on the\nmerits of any case now pending. However, different, potentially inconsistent, decisions by different\njudges does no service.  Such a convoluted result would leave the public in disarray and uncertain\nabout their legal rights. \nThat these cases would benefit from a transfer plainly is evident.  At hearing, no party\nexpressed opposition to the court’s transfer related inquiries.  Moreover, the benefits of a transfer\nare apparent from the parties’ positions of record.  For one example, on June 23, 2016, the Berger\nplaintiffs  filed  in  United  States  a  supplemental  brief  indicating  that  they  would  “continue\nparticipating in [the Eastern and Middle District] proceedings unless and until they are consolidated\nin a single district.”  United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE 50 at 1).  Indeed, the Berger\nplaintiffs provided that, if these proceedings are to remain fragmented, they have “no choice but to\nprotect their interests in both courts.”  Id. (DE 50 at 3).  For another example, NCFP similarly has\nevidenced its intent to proceed in both the Eastern and Middle Districts absent consolidation in a\nsingle district.  Id. (DE 58).  In light of the parties’ clear intent to pursue and protect their interests\nwherever necessary, the court concurs with the Berger plaintiffs, “judicial efficiency would be\nserved by having [all actions in the Eastern and Middle District concerning the Act] consolidated\nand tried before the same tribunal.”  Id. (DE 50 at 2). \n21\n\nBerger and NCFP are transferred to the Middle District for all the reasons outlined above. \nA transfer will give both sides the opportunity to attack or defend the Act with a full arsenal of legal\ntheories.  Resolution of this dispute needs such an arrangement.  Civil Rule 1 compels it.  The public\ninterest requires it. \nCONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, the court DENIES the Berger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate case\nnumber 5:16-CV-240-FL with case number 5:16-CV-238-BO.  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 7). \nLikewise, the court DENIES NCFP’s motion to consolidate case number 5:16-CV-245-FL with case\nnumber 5:16-CV-238-BO.  NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE 12). \nOn its own initiative, having heard from the parties further at hearing and conference June\n21, 2016, the court TRANSFERS case number 5:16-CV-240-FL and case number 5:16-CV-245-FL\nto the Middle District.  The clerk of court is DIRECTED immediately to transmit a certified copy\nof this order and associated case files to John S. Brubaker, Clerk of Court, United States District\nCourt for the Middle District of North Carolina, and thereafter close these cases. \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of June, 2016.\n_____________________________\nLOUISE W.

In\nlight of the Joint Notice filed by the parties, the Court will not set this matter for a\nstatus conference on August 26, 2016. However, it appears that a status conference in\nthe near future would be appropriate, in order to address any discovery and scheduling\nissues. Therefore, the Court will plan to conduct a discovery status conference on\nSeptember 2, 2016, and given the potential issues to be addressed, the Court will\nconduct that status conference in person rather than by telephone hearing. Therefore,\nthis matter will be set for a discovery status conference on September 2, 2016 at 10:00\na.m. in Courtroom 3 of United States Courthouse in Winston−Salem, NC. The parties\nshould file their Joint Notice by August 31, 2016 to outline any issues that they would\nseek to raise at the status conference.
