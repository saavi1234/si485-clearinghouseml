    "summary": "<p>This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (&ldquo;H.B. 2&rdquo;), which was passed in March 23, 2016. For the others, see related cases section, below.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that while in government buildings, individuals only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules). In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.&rdquo; This change prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law. The DOJ asked the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9 that he would remedy the violations, \"including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.\"</p>\r\n<p>Instead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking declaratory relief that HB2 didn&rsquo;t violate federal law. That case is <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15316\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McCrory v. United States</a>. On that same day, this suit was brought in the same court by the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate and the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. They sought the same declaratory relief sought by Governor McCrory as well as a declaration by the court that the DOJ had exceeded the federal government&rsquo;s separation of powers, violated the Tenth Amendment, and was arbitrary and capricious under section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 702-706).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs made a number of constitutional arguments to support their position. They began by alleging that transgender people weren't a protected class under the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus could not be protected under Title VII, which is authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment. They based their Tenth Amendment federalism claims primarily on the argument that regulation of bathrooms didn't affect interstate commerce and were thus a police power reserved to the states. They also suggested that there was a constitutional right to privacy in bathrooms that would be violated if states were forced to allow transgender individuals access to bathrooms in accordance with their gender identities.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs further made arguments that the DOJ&rsquo;s position wasn&rsquo;t acceptable under administrative law. Plaintiffs suggested that the DOJ&rsquo;s reasoning on the VAWA would require North Carolina to provide prisoners claiming transgender status access to bathrooms and showers matching their gender identities, which they claimed would violate earlier regulations promulgated by the DOJ on that subject. They also claimed that the states couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen that they would be forced to allow transgender individuals access to bathrooms when Title IX was enacted, which would mean that the DOJ was exceeding its authority by adding meaning to the statute that Congress hadn&rsquo;t originally intended or expected it to have.</p>\r\n<p>This case was assigned to Judge Louise Wood Flanagan. The plaintiffs sought consolidation with the <em>McCrory</em> case, which was before Judge Terrence W. Boyle. On June 13, 2016, Judge Boyle issued an order stating that he would allow the cases to be consolidated. On June 15, Judge Flanagan scheduled a hearing to determine whether the cases should be consolidated.</p>\r\n<p>In the hearing, the court denied the motion to consolidate and instead transferred this case to the Middle District of North Carolina, where three other HB2 cases were in progress, with no objection from any of the parties. The transfer order was given on June 29, 2016, and this case was assigned to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder and Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake.</p>\r\n<p>On July 14, the judge ordered the parties in this case and the three associated HB2 cases in North Carolina to appear on August 1 on their various motions pending in a consolidated hearing, and indicated the trials would take place in October or November. The Judge requested they file a joint statement of agreements reached and explaining their respective positions by July 22 for a pretrial scheduling conference. On July 25, the court consolidated these cases for the purpose of discovery only.</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal given that they were pursuing the same claims as <em>United States of America v. North Carolina</em> and their claims were duplicative of those in that case.</p>",

The goal of these motions is to create one omnibus case including another case also\nchallenging purported federal overreach in the regulation of those same facilities, McCrory v. United\nStates, 5:16-CV-238-BO (E.D.N.C. 2016) (“McCrory”).  On June 21, 2016, a telephonic hearing and\nRule 16 status conference was held in Berger and NCFP; counsel in McCrory also attended.\nBACKGROUND\nA. The Ordinance and Legislative Response\nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte, North Carolina, City Council voted to approve “An\nOrdinance Amending Chapter 2 of the Charlotte City Code Entitled ‘Administration’, Chapter 12\nEntitled ‘Human Relations’, and Chapter 22 Entitled ‘Vehicles for Hire,’” unofficially designated\nby the city as the “Non-Discrimination Ordinance” (the “Ordinance”).  See http://charmeck.org/city/\ncharlotte/CityClerk/Documents/NDOrdinance.pdf (last visited June 29, 2016).  As relevant here, the\nOrdinance added to the city’s then-existing prohibition on discrimination protections for persons\ndiscriminated against on the basis of “gender identity [or] gender expression.”  Id. § 1.  It also\nrepealed certain pre-existing provisions of the Charlotte City Code allowing businesses to restrict\non the basis of biological sex access to “[r]estrooms, shower rooms, bathhouses and similar facilities\n2\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 2 of 22\n\nwhich are in their nature distinctly private.”  Id. § 3.  Thus, by its terms, the Ordinance allowed\ntransgender persons, that is, those who identify with a sex different from their biological sex\nassigned at birth, to use the restroom or shower facility that corresponds with their gender identity. \nThe Ordinance was scheduled to go into effect April 1, 2016.\nAlmost immediately, the Ordinance drew criticism from North Carolina Governor Pat\nMcCrory, members of the state’s legislature, and some members of the public.  Opponents argued\nthat the Ordinance swept far more broadly than the Charlotte City Council had intended and\npotentially could have negative consequences.  On February 23, 2016, Speaker Moore, one of the\nOrdinance’s opponents, vowed “to correct this radical course.”  Steve Harrison & Jim Morrill, After\nLGBT Vote, NC House Speaker Says Lawmakers Will ‘Correct This Radical Course’, Charlotte\nObserver,  Feb.  23,  2016,  available  at  http://  www.charlotteobserver.com/news/\npolitics-government/article61932507.html (last visited June 29, 2016).  On March 22, 2016, Speaker\nMoore and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, President of the North Carolina Senate,\ncalled both houses of the legislature into special session to address the Ordinance.\nFollowing a one-day special session, held March 23, 2016, the state legislature passed\nSession Law 2016-3, titled “An Act to Provide for Single-Sex Multiple Occupancy Bathroom and\nChanging Facilities in Schools and Public Agencies and to Create Statewide Consistency in\nRegulation of Employment and Public Accommodations,” commonly known either as the “Public\nFacilities Privacy and Security Act,” or “HB2” (the “Act”).  See H.B. 2, 2016 Sess. L. 3 (N.C.\n2016).  Section 1 of the Act, which is the most relevant section for purposes of these lawsuits, targets\ndirectly  Charlotte’s  Ordinance.    It  requires  “local  boards  of  education”  and  “public\naccommodations” to adhere to a single sex, multiple occupancy bathroom policy, with “sex” defined\n3\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 3 of 22\n\nas “biological” or “physical” sex as “stated on a person’s birth certificate.”  See id. §§ 1.2 & 1.3; see\nalso id. § 1.1.  Other provisions of the Act preempt local government control over the minimum\nwage, id. § 2.1; the power of local government to condition contracts with private parties on certain\nconditions or employment practices inconsistent with state law, id. §§ 2.2 & 2.3; and local\ndiscrimination ordinances.  See id. §§ 3.1 & 3.3.  Governor McCrory signed the Act into law on the\nMarch 23, 2016, session date.1 \nB. Subsequent Litigation\nThe Act has been met both with ire and praise.  On March 28, 2016, one of the groups\nexpressing displeasure, the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.  See Carcaño v. McCrory,\n1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP (M.D.N.C. 2016)  (“Carcaño”).  Carcaño was brought, among others, on\nbehalf of Joaquín Carcaño and Payton McGarry, persons born biologically female but who live their\nlives as males.  As alleged, Carcaño and McGarry were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have\nreceived hormone therapy to assist in the treatment of their medical condition.  \nAccording to the complaint, aside from hormone therapy, treatment for gender dysphoria\nrequires use of single-sex restroom and locker room facilities consistent with one’s gender identity. \nCarcaño and McGarry allege that they will be damaged as a result of the Act’s biological sex\nrestriction on state-operated bathroom and shower facilities.  See Carcaño, 1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP\n(DE 1, ¶¶28–33; 41; 45–53; 64–66; 72–82). \n1  Thereafter, on April 12, 2016, Governor McCrory signed Executive Order 93, implementing the substantive\nprovisions of the Act.  See Executive Order No. 93: To Protect Privacy and Equality (Apr. 12, 2016), available at https://\nncgovernor.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/documents/files/McCrory%20EO%2093_0.pdf (last visited June 29, 2016). \n4\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 4 of 22\n\nThe Carcaño plaintiffs assert a variety of claims against Governor McCrory; Roy Cooper,\nthe North Carolina Attorney General; the University of North Carolina; the Board of Governors of\nthe University of North Carolina; and Louis Bissette, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Governors.  As\nrelevant here, the Carcaño plaintiffs allege that § 1 of the Act violates on its face the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  In particular, they allege that § 1 classifies people on the\nbasis of their sex, gender identity, and transgender status, and treats transgender people different\nthan similarly situated people who are not transgender.   \nIn addition, Carcaño, an employee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and\nMcGarry, a student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, allege that § 1 of Act violates\non its face their rights under Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.  In particular, they allege that by limiting bathroom, changing facility, and\nshower facility access along the lines of biological sex, defendants have denied them benefits “on\nthe basis of sex”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The Carcaño plaintiffs also raise a number of Constitutional\nclaims not relevant here.2\nC. Determination Letters\nNotwithstanding Carcaño, the state proceeded to implement the Act.  Those efforts were met\nwith hostility from the United States.  For example, on April 5, 2016, the University of North\nCarolina, through its president, Margaret Spellings, publically indicated that the university system\nwould comply with the Act.  In reaction to that guidance, the United States Department of Education\n2  For example, they allege that § 1 of the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause\nbecause it discriminates against homosexuals on the basis of sexual orientation; §§ 2 and 3 of the Act violate the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by preempting local non-discrimination ordinances; and that the Act\nas a whole violates the substantive aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by violating their\nfundamental rights to privacy and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n5\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 5 of 22\n\n(“USDOE”) requested information for the purpose of determining whether the university system,\na recipient of federal funds, was in compliance with Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act\n(the “VAWA”), 42 U.S.C. § 13701 through § 14040.  Previously, the USDOE had interpreted Title\nIX and its associated regulations with the purpose of including transgender individuals within the\nstatute’s reach, at least with respect to bathroom access.  See generally G.G. ex rel. Grimm v.\nGloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., __ F.3d__, 2016 WL 1567467 (4th Cir. 2016).\nOn May 4, 2016, the United States Department of Justice (“USDOJ”) issued a series of three\n“determination  letters”  respectively  to  Governor  McCrory;  Secretary  of  the  North  Carolina\nDepartment of Public Safety, Frank Perry; and President Spellings.  All three letters are to the same\neffect: § 1 of the Act violates federal law.  The letter directed to Governor McCrory concludes that\n§ 1 of the Act violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\nseq, on its face.  The letter to Secretary Perry likewise concludes that § 1 of the Act facially violates\nboth Title VII and the VAWA.  Finally, the letter directed toward President Spellings likewise\nconcludes that § 1 of the Act facially violates both Title IX and the VAWA.  The United States gave\neach recipient up to and including May 9, 2016, to “remedy” their respective violations of federal\nlaw or risk losing federal funding.\nD. Initiation of Litigation Following Carcaño\nComing on the heels of Carcaño are three related federal lawsuits filed May 9, 2016.  One\nwas filed in the Middle District and two were filed in this district.  A fourth related case was filed\nin this district on the following day.\n6\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 6 of 22\n\n1. McCrory\nAt 8:31 a.m. on May 9, 2016, Governor McCrory and Secretary Perry filed McCrory in this\ndistrict, assigned to another judge.  See 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 1).  Named as defendants are the\nUnited States of America; the USDOJ; Loretta Lynch, in her official capacity as United States\nAttorney General; and Vanita Gupta, in her official capacity as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney\nGeneral.  The McCrory plaintiffs seek a declaration that the state is “in compliance with Title VII”\nunder the text of that statute.  Id. (DE 1 at 8).  In addition, they seek a declaration that the state is\n“in compliance with [the] VAWA,” which they assume “specifically includes gender identity as a\nprotected class.”  Id. (DE 1 at 8–9).\n2.  United States\nAt 3:16 p.m. on May 9, 2016, the United States of America filed suit in the Middle District. \nSee United States v. North Carolina, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (M.D.N.C. 2016) (the “United States”\ncase).  Defendants in that case are the State of North Carolina; Governor McCrory, the North\nCarolina Department of Public Safety; the University of North Carolina; and its Board of Governors. \nThe United States seeks a declaration that § 1 of the Act violates Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA.\n3. Berger\nAlso on May 9, 2006, eight minutes after United States was filed in the Middle District, and\nabout seven hours after McCrory was filed here, Senator Berger and Speaker Moore filed Berger. \nSeparate and apart from McCrory, Berger develops additional theories challenging the validity of\nthe USDOJ’s interpretative position.  For example, as Berger relates to Title VII, the Berger\nplaintiffs allege that § 1 of the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and that the\nterm “sex” does not include gender identity.  Second, they allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation\n7\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 7 of 22\n\nof Title VII, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, runs afoul of Section Five of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, because the remedy it provides is not “congruent and proportional” relative to the\ndiscrimination it seeks to prevent.  Third, the Berger plaintiffs allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation\nof Title VII, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, violates a number of principles related to\nfederalism and the separation of powers, including the Commerce Clause, Spending Clause,\nPresentment Clause, and the Tenth Amendment.  Finally, they allege that, even if § 1 of the Act\nviolates Title VII in some instances, it cannot be facially invalid where it has at least one possible,\npermissible application. \nBerger also raises concerns in response to the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title IX and the\nVAWA, also not at issue in McCrory.  In the context of Title IX, the Berger plaintiffs allege that § 1\nof the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and that the term “sex” does not\ninclude gender identity.  Second, they allege that the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title IX, even if\nvalid in light of the statute’s text, was promulgated in violation of the notice-and-comment rule\nmaking procedure required by the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq.,\nbecause,  notwithstanding  the  USDOJ’s  position  to  the  contrary,  the  rule  announced  was\n“substantive” or “legislative,” as opposed to merely “interpretative.”  5 U.S.C. § 553.  Third, the\nBerger plaintiffs interpose a host of Constitutional claims targeting the USDOJ’s interpretation of\nTitle IX, including that the USDOJ’s interpretation of that statute and its regulations violates the\nfederalism principles embodied in the Tenth Amendment; violates the Spending Clause; and requires\nthe state to violate both its citizens’ fundamental right to bodily privacy and parents’ fundamental\nliberty interest in directing the education and upbringing of their children, at least with respect to\nmatters of sexuality.  Finally, at least with respect to Title IX, they allege that, under the USDOJ’s\n8\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 8 of 22\n\ninterpretation of Title IX, § 1 of the Act still has some permissible applications and, therefore, is not\nfacially invalid. \nIn the context of the VAWA, the Berger plaintiffs similarly allege that § 1 of the Act does\nnot violate the VAWA because it does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity, but rather\non the basis of biological sex, a consideration, they submit, that clearly is permissible under the\nVAWA, and, in all events, that the term “sex” does not include gender identity.  Second, they also\nallege that the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, is\ninconsistent with the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious, where the USDOJ implemented it\nwithout considering fully the consequences of that interpretation, and otherwise not in accordance\nwith the law, where that interpretation violates the USDOJ’s own regulations, the “Prison Rape\nElimination Act National Standards, ” 15 C.F.R. § 115.5 et seq.  Third, the Berger plaintiffs allege\nthat the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA violates Tenth Amendment’s federalism principles,\nviolates the Spending Clause, and requires the state to violate the Eighth Amendment rights of its\ninmates.  Finally, they allege that § 1 of the Act, even if it violates the VAWA in some instances,\ndoes not violate the VAWA on its face, because it does not violate the VAWA in all instances.\n4. NCFP\nOne day later, on May 10, 2016, NCFP filed NCFP in this district.  Like Berger, NCFP was\nassigned to this judge.  Unlike McCory, and like Berger in part, NCFP centers on Title IX.  Also like\nBerger, NCFP raises other, different issues for decision also not embraced by McCrory. \nNCFP seeks a declaration that the USDOE’s interpretation of Title IX, as adopted by the\nUSDOJ, is inconsistent with the text of the statute and violates the APA, a federal statute, and the\nConstitution.  First, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX runs contrary\n9\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 9 of 22\n\nto the text of the relevant statute and regulations, because the term “sex” is unambiguous and may\nnot be interpreted to include gender identity. \nSecond, NCFP alleges that, even if valid in light of the statute’s text, the United States’s\ninterpretation of Title IX violates the APA where it was promulgated without observing the APA’s\nnotice-and-comment  rule  making  procedures.    Likewise,  it  alleges  that  the  United  States’s\ninterpretation of Title IX violates the APA where it is arbitrary and capricious because the USDOE,\nand by proxy the USDOJ, did not engage in reasoned decision making when adopting its\ninterpretation; failed to consider potential negative consequences of mixing the biological sexes in\nbathrooms, shower facilities, and the like; and failed to explain appropriately its actions. \nThird, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX, even if valid in light\nof the statute’s text, violates a federal statute and certain Constitutional provisions.  In particular,\nNCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of Title IX violates the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., because it substantially burdens the organization’s\nmembers’ sincerely held religious beliefs regarding modesty and nudity and does not further a\ncompelling government interest.  Likewise, NCFP alleges that the United States’s interpretation of\nTitle  IX  violates  the  organization’s  members’  Fourteenth  Amendment  rights,  including  the\nfundamental right to privacy and the fundamental liberty interest in directing the education and\nupbringing of one’s child; violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause; and violates the\nSpending Clause. \nIn addition, NCFP seeks a declaration that § 1 of the Act does not violate Title IX, that § 1\nof the Act does not violate the VAWA, and, in all events, the USDOJ’s interpretation of the VAWA\n10\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 10 of 22\n\nexceeds the VAWA’s regulatory mandate.  NCFP also requests an injunction, prohibiting the United\nStates from stripping the state’s federal funding pending disposition of its case.\nE. Subsequent Litigation Developments\n1. Carcaño \nCarcaño  has  progressed  substantially  and  now  presents  issues  concerning  USDOJ’s\ninterpretation of Title IX as it relates to that statute’s text, the procedure employed by the USDOJ\nin interpreting the statute, and the validity of the USDOJ’s interpretation in light of other substantive\nprovisions of law.  On May 25, 2016, the Berger plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene in Carcaño. \n1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP (DE 33).  Their motion to intervene was granted June 6, 2016.  Id. (DE 44). \nOn June 9, 2016, the Berger plaintiffs answered the complaint and interposed counterclaims against\nthe Carcaño plaintiffs.  Id. (DE 54).  \nAs relevant here, the Berger plaintiffs now assert in Carcaño a claim against the Carcaño\nplaintiffs for a declaration that § 1 of the Act does not violate on its face the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  In addition, they request a declaration that § 1 of the Act\ndoes not violate Title IX, or, in the alternative, that the Carcaño plaintiffs’ interpretation of Title IX\nviolates the federal Constitution.   \nIn the meantime, the Carcaño parties, including the Berger plaintiffs and Governor McCrory,\nnearly have completed briefing on a motion for preliminary injunction.  Id. (DE 21; DE 22; DE 27;\nDE 55; DE 61; DE 73).  That motion seeks to enjoin Governor McCrory, as well as other\ndefendants, from enforcing § 1 of the Act.\n11\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 11 of 22\n\n2. United States\nUnited States presents for decision nearly the full complement of issues presented in this\ndistrict in McCrory, Berger, and NCFP.  The Berger plaintiffs moved to intervene in United States\non May 17, 2016.  The Berger plaintiffs declared in United States in furtherance of their motion to\nintervene similarity of issues raised here: “[O]n the same day the [USDOJ] sued in this District, the\nProposed Intervenors filed their own declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of North\nCarolina, raising multiple questions of law and fact nearly identical to questions raised by the\nDepartment  –  questions  which,  moreover,  are  raised  in  the  pleading  accompanying  this\nintervention.”  United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE 9 at 6).  Likewise, on June 28, 2016,\nNCFP moved to intervene in United States.  Id. (DE 58).  In support of its motion, NCFP attests to\nthe similarity between NCFP and United States: “NCFP has a pending action in the Eastern District\nof North Carolina involving some of the same legal issues at stake in this case.”  Id. (DE 59 at 6). \nThat case also includes challenges by Governor McCrory, through the vehicle of affirmative\ndefenses, to the USDOJ’s interpretation of Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA in light of the text of\nthose statutes, the procedures employed by the USDOJ in interpreting those statutes, and other\nsubstantive  provisions  of  law.    Id.  (DE  32).    Moreover,  Governor  McCrory  asserts  two\ncounterclaims that are identical to his principal claims in McCrory.  Id. (DE 32). \nUnited States has progressed, too, on claim for injunctive relief.  On June 10, 2016, the\nUnited States parties filed a joint motion for injunctive relief, raising the time-sensitive issue of\nwhether or not certain federal funds made available to defendants under the VAWA should be\nsuspended, a concern implicit also in Berger and NCFP.  By order entered June 23, 2016, the court\ngranted the parties’ joint motion, holding that “while entertaining serious concerns about the\n12\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 12 of 22\n\npositions taken by the parties and the court’s authority to enter an injunction under the circumstances\nof this case, the court finds that, in the absence of clear authority to the contrary and in light of the\nsubstantial harm that suspension of funding in question would inflict on wholly innocent third\nparties, the court will grant the motion preliminarily.”  Id. (DE 53 at 1).  \n3. Related Eastern District of North Carolina Cases\nOn May 17, 2016, the McCrory plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to transfer their case\nto the Middle District.  There, they pointed out that United States had been, for all intents and\npurposes, filed contemporaneously with McCrory.  In addition, they pointed out that Carcaño, filed\nnearly two months earlier, raises similar issues and has been assigned to the same United States\nDistrict Judge.  The McCrory plaintiffs argued that a transfer to the Middle District would “greatly\nenhance efficiency for the parties and the public while avoiding piecemeal litigation and reducing\ninconvenience to the witnesses.”  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 10 at 6).\nThereafter, on May 23, 2016, the instant motions to consolidate were filed in Berger and\nNCFP.  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 7); NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE 12).  The Berger plaintiffs\nargue that decision on their motion seeking to consolidate should come first, before any decision on\nthe McCrory plaintiffs’ consent motion to transfer.  “[B]ecause McCrory and this case are obviously\nrelated, the proper course is first to consolidate the two cases before making any decision about\nwhether or not to transfer them to the Middle District.”  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 8 at 6). \nGrabbing hold of the “interested party” role designation in the court’s electronic case filing\nsystem (“CM/ECF”), without leave or the making of any motion to intervene, the Berger plaintiffs\ncatapulted themselves in the McCrory case.  There, they filed a motion to consolidate identical to\n13\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 13 of 22\n\nthe one they previously had filed in the Berger case.  Id. (DE 7); McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE\n11).  \nThe McCrory plaintiffs followed suit, adopting CM/ECF’s “interested party” label  and, also\nwithout leave or the making of any motion to intervene, filed a response in Berger in support of the\nBerger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate Berger with McCrory, on the condition however that any\nconsolidation not “in any way impede[] or interfere[] with the transfer of [McCrory] to the Middle\nDistrict.”  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 13 at 2).  In the Berger case, defendants’ response to the\nmotion to consolidate was not due until on or before June 16, 2016. \nOn May 24, 2016, one day after the Berger plaintiffs filed their motion before this court,\nNCFP filed in NCFP its motion to consolidate NCFP with McCrory.  NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE\n12).  NCFP, like the Berger plaintiffs, put itself on the docket in the McCrory case where on May\n24, 2016, as an “interested party” in CM/ECF,  it filed an identical motion to consolidate NCFP and\nMcCrory.  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 22).  \nInto the muddied case waters the Berger defendants had not yet waded.  As noted, their\nresponse to the motion to consolidate in the Berger case before the undersigned was not due to be\nmade until on or before June 16, 2016. \nIn the meantime, on May 23, 2016, the judge assigned to McCrory announced he would\ndecide the “interested party” Berger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate before addressing the McCrory\nplaintiffs’ consent motion to transfer.  Id. (May 23, 2016, text order).  On May 26, 2016, the judge\nassigned to McCrory stated that the final decision on consolidation rests with the judge to whom the\ncase is assigned, announcing  that consolidation of McCrory and Berger “will be allowed if\npermitted by the judge to whom [Berger] is currently assigned.”  Id. (DE 32 at 1–2).  On June 7,\n14\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 14 of 22\n\n2016, as the Berger plaintiffs’ instant motion to consolidate was ripening before the undersigned,\nthe judge assigned to McCrory denied the McCrory plaintiff’s consent motion to transfer.  McCrory,\n5:16-CV-238-BO (DE 34).  \nOn June 13, 2016, three days before the Berger defendants’ response to the Berger plaintiff’s\ninstant motion to consolidate was due to be filed in the above-captioned case, the judge assigned to\nMcCrory again suggested, by separate order, that Berger and McCrory would be consolidated. \nId. (DE 36).  On June 15, 2016, two days before the NCFP defendants’ response was due in NCFP,\nthe undersigned set these cases before her for hearing on the motions to consolidate and for Rule 16\nstatus conference for June 21, 2016.  On June 20, 2016, one day before that hearing and conference,\nthe judge assigned to McCrory suggested in separate order that NCFP also would be consolidated\nwith McCory.3 Id. (DE 43). \n3  The undersigned has waited for the separate response deadlines to expire before ruling on the instant motions\nto consolidate in Berger and NCFP.  It appears, however, that during that time confusion has developed in the clerk’s\noffice and among the litigants as to the status of these cases.  For example, the Berger plaintiffs having entered McCory\nand filed there their motion to consolidate pending before the undersigned triggered  discourse with the McCory\nplaintiffs, who responded separately on May 25, 2016.  The next day, a “court only” flag prematurely was triggered by\nthe McCrory case manager stating “Replies due by 6/13/16,” seemingly depriving the Berger defendants of their\nopportunity timely to respond in this case, which period did not elapse until June 16, 2016.  On June 14, 2016, after\nsuggested ruling on the motion in McCrory the day before, defendants in NCFP filed response in opposition to\nconsolidation, wherein they misapprehended significance of  suggested ruling in McCrory.  There can be no\nconsolidation of two cases assigned different judges until the judge assigned to the case to be consolidated relinquishes\nher authority over it.  See Vorel v. Johns, No. 5:10-CT-3005-FL, 2010 WL 4735829, at *1 (E.D.N.C. Nov. 15, 2010). \nAs the judges of this court have noted, that much should be plain.  The consolidation of cases assigned to multiple judges\nnecessarily entails the reassignment of the case to be consolidated from one judge to the other.  Without orderly rules\nand procedures to govern consolidation, and, by proxy, reassignment, a party’s indiscriminately filed motion to\nconsolidate might invite dereliction of the carefully constructed system used to distribute cases between the judges of\na district.  To make it even plainer that final decision on motions in cases assigned to me rests with me, to promote\nefficiencies sought after by all parties, where the nature of this litigation has been made more complex in no small part\nby the parties’ own strategic litigation decisions, and given the practical difficulties arising for the clerk’s office in\neffective case management, the court set hearing and Rule 16 status conference in these cases June 15, 2016, by\ntelephone for June 21, 2016. \n15\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 15 of 22\n\nCOURT’S DISCUSSION\nA. Motions to Consolidate Berger and NCFP with McCrory\nThe court denies the instant motions to consolidate Berger and NCFP with McCrory. \nGranting those motions would impede the efficient administration of justice.  There exists a more\ndirect path to final resolution of the central question presented in all five actions, the validity of the\nAct under federal Constitutional and statutory law, which question encompasses all of the other\nissues raised by the McCrory plaintiffs, the Berger plaintiffs, and NCFP. \n“If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may . . . join\nfor hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions; . . . consolidate the actions; or . . . issue\nany other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).  In ruling on a motion\nto consolidate the “critical question” is whether the case presents “specific risks of prejudice and\npossible confusion” and, if so, the magnitude of those risks relative to the “risk of inconsistent\nadjudications on common factual and legal issues, the burden on parties, witnesses and available\njudicial resources posed by multiple lawsuits, the length of time required to conclude multiple suits\nas against a single one, and the relative expense to all concerned of the single-trial, multiple-trial\nalternatives.”  Arnold v. E. Air Lines, Inc., 681 F.2d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 1982), reh’g granted and\nrev’d on other grounds, 712 F.2d 899 (4th Cir. 1983) (en banc). \nIn the usual case, consolidation would be warranted.  The risk of inconsistent adjudication\nis high and the relative expense of multiple proceedings, as compared to a single proceeding, is\nplain.  As to the risk of inconsistent adjudication, the similar substantive and procedural issues raised\nby McCrory, Berger, and NCFP are presented now through the vehicle of five different cases,\nincluding Carcaño and United States, assigned to three different district judges over the span of two\n16\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 16 of 22\n\ndistricts.  The very fact that these cases are presented to isolated decision makers raises beyond the\nspeculative level the fear of inconsistent adjudications.  That threat is even more real in light of the\nfact that each case presents a collection of substantively identical claims along side different, but\nrelated claims. \nNotwithstanding the above, the court declines the parties’ invitation to consolidate either\nBerger or NCFP with McCrory on the unique circumstances presented.  Considering only the three\ncases pending in this district, it is abundantly clear that the true center of gravity around which this\ndispute lies is presented to the undersigned, rendering consolidation with the less rigorous McCrory\ninappropriate.\nBerger and NCFP present a more robust challenge to the United States’s interpretative\nposition.  The Berger plaintiffs and NCFP attack the USDOJ’s interpretative guidance through three\navenues.  First, they each raises a textual argument, alleging that the USDOJ’s interpretation is\nimpermissible in light of Title VII, Title IX, and the VAWA’s text.  Second, they each raises\nprocedural issues, alleging that, even if the USDOJ’s interpretation of the relevant statutes is\npermissible under the text of those statutes, that said interpretation was promulgated in violation of\nthe APA.  Finally, they each raises a substantive, independent legal challenge to the USDOJ’s\ninterpretative guidance.  In particular, the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP all allege that the USDOJ’s\ninterpretation of Title VII, Title IX, or the VAWA violates numerous provisions of the Constitution. \nThe McCrory plaintiffs, by contrast, limit their challenge to the text of the relevant statute.  For\nexample, they request a declaration that the state is in compliance with the VAWA, assuming that\nthe VAWA “specifically includes gender identity as a protected class.”  McCrory, 5:16-CV-238-BO\n(DE 1 at 8–9). Thus, consolidation with the less rigorous McCrory is inappropriate.\n17\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 17 of 22\n\nConsolidation of Berger and NCFP with McCrory also is inappropriate where it would defy\nthe mandate of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 1.  The court must “construe[], administer[], and\nemploy[] [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] . . . to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive\ndetermination of every action and proceeding.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Consolidation of the cases now\npending in this district falters on that goal, where it provides only temporary relief to a long-term\nproblem.  Even if the court were to consolidate these cases, there still is a risk of inconsistent and\nexpensive parallel proceedings where similar actions remain pending in the Middle District and no\nparty seems ready to accept a stay in any case.  In fact, the Berger plaintiffs recently have confirmed\nthat, in the absence of some kind of single-district solution, they would continue to press their\nposition in both the Eastern and Middle Districts.  See United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE\n50 at 1–3).  A transfer best accomplishes Rule 1’s goal.\nB. Court’s Sua Sponte Transfer of Berger and NCFP\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court may transfer a case to any other district\n“where it might have been brought” if such transfer is determined in the court’s discretion to be “for\nthe convenience of the parties and witnesses [and] in the interest of justice.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). \nThe district court may consider the possibility of transfer sua sponte.  Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d 722,\n729 n.7 (4th Cir. 1986).\nIn exercising its discretion to transfer a case, the court is guided by a number of factors,\nincluding consideration of practical solutions of administrative efficiency that might make the\nproceedings easy, expeditious, and inexpensive.  See Plant Genetic Sys., N.V. v. Ciba Seeds, 933\nF. Supp. 519, 527 (M.D.N.C. 1996).  In addition, where similar law suits have been filed in multiple\nfederal forums, the first-filed suit usually should have priority, “absent the showing of balance of\n18\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 18 of 22\n\nconvenience in favor of the second action.”  Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co.,\n386 F.3d 581, 594–95 (4th Cir. 2004); Ellicot Mach. Corp. v. Modern Welding Co., 502 F.2d 178,\n180 (4th Cir. 1974).  To determine whether a case is the “first filed” the court looks to 1) the\nchronology of the filings, 2) the similarity of the parties, and 3) the similarity of the issues at stake. \nNutrition & Fitness, Inc. v. Blue Stuff, Inc., 264 F. Supp. 2d 357, 360 (W.D.N.C. 2003); see also\nAllied-Gen. Nuclear Servs. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 675 F.2d 610, 611 n.1 (4th Cir. 1982);\nCarbide & Carbon Chems. Corp. v. U.S. Indus. Chems., 140 F.2d 47, 49 (4th Cir. 1944). \nAs a threshold matter, both Berger and NCFP could have been brought in the Middle\nDistrict.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), where a plaintiff sues an agency or officer of the United\nStates, venue may be laid in any judicial district where “a substantial part of the events or omissions\ngiving rise to the claim occurred.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).  A significant portion of the events giving\nrise to the claims at issue occurred in the Middle District. If the United States were to pull federal\nfunding from schools, universities, and the prison system, among other things, the effect of that\naction would be felt wide, including in the Middle District.  In fact, the court in that district already\nhas addressed this issue, preliminarily, for the benefit of the State of North Carolina.\nHere, the “interest of justice” favors a transfer of the Berger and NCFP cases to the Middle\nDistrict.  Both the “first-filed” rule and considerations of administrative efficiency counsel in favor\nof that result.  First, Carcaño was the first-filed case and is owed a degree of deference.  That case\nchallenges § 1 of the Act under Title IX.  The Title IX claim raised by the Carcaño plaintiffs is the\nmirror image of the Title IX claims raised by the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP.  They raise common\nquestions concerning the validity of the Act under a federal statute.  In many ways, the claims\npresented by the Carcaño plaintiffs on the one hand, and the Berger plaintiffs and NCFP, on the\n19\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 19 of 22\n\nother, are two sides of the same coin; the Constitutional and statutory claims asserted by the Berger\nplaintiffs and NCFP with respect to Title IX respond directly to and could be asserted in defense to\nthe Carcaño plaintiffs’ Title IX claim.  \nAlthough the Berger plaintiffs also raise Title VII and VAWA claims, the conceptual\ndifference between a fully and thoroughly litigated Title IX claim, as compared to a Title VII and\nVAWA claim is minimal because the relevant language in each statute is substantively identical;\neach claim likely will turn on the same or similar analysis.  See Jennings v. Univ. of N.C., 482 F.3d\n686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) (courts look to Title VII to interpret Title IX); Braden v. Piggly Wiggly,\n4 F. Supp. 2d 1357 1361 (M.D. Ala. 1998) (“The legislative history also reveals that Congress\nintended the language of the VAWA to mirror that of Title VII.”).  Thus, the structural similarity\nbetween the three cases is a persuasive basis upon which to ground a transfer. \nHowever, the court recognizes that Carcaño is not a perfect analogue of either Berger or\nNCFP.  In particular, Carcaño challenges the Constitutionality of the Act directly, while Berger and\nNCFP challenge only the USDOJ’s interpretation of several federal statutes.  Even though these\ncases are not perfectly analogous, the totality of the circumstances suggests they should be tried\ntogether, or at least on a unified schedule before one judge.  As an initial matter, § 1404 does not\nrequire a one-to-one correspondence of issues.  In addition, although the issues raised in both cases\ncertainly are unique, the court views them in their larger context.  All of the issues presented\nbetween Berger, NCFP, and Carcaño bear on a common question, whether the Act survives in the\nface of federal law.  Thus, the court considers Carcaño to be the first filed and will defer to it.\nIn any case, the joint administration of Berger and NCFP alongside Carcaño and United\nStates will accrue significant administrative and financial benefits to all interested parties.  As to\n20\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 20 of 22\n\nadministrative benefits, the litigants will receive substantial benefit of having one judge control all\nfour cases, and with them all substantive issues related to the validity of the Act under federal\nConstitutional and statutory law.  That will allow a single decision maker to render timely decisions\nand coordinate deadlines between the parties.  Moreover, the public will experience a significant\nbenefit from the joint administration of these cases.  The undersigned makes no forecast on the\nmerits of any case now pending. However, different, potentially inconsistent, decisions by different\njudges does no service.  Such a convoluted result would leave the public in disarray and uncertain\nabout their legal rights. \nThat these cases would benefit from a transfer plainly is evident.  At hearing, no party\nexpressed opposition to the court’s transfer related inquiries.  Moreover, the benefits of a transfer\nare apparent from the parties’ positions of record.  For one example, on June 23, 2016, the Berger\nplaintiffs  filed  in  United  States  a  supplemental  brief  indicating  that  they  would  “continue\nparticipating in [the Eastern and Middle District] proceedings unless and until they are consolidated\nin a single district.”  United States, 1:16-CV-425-TDS-JEP (DE 50 at 1).  Indeed, the Berger\nplaintiffs provided that, if these proceedings are to remain fragmented, they have “no choice but to\nprotect their interests in both courts.”  Id. (DE 50 at 3).  For another example, NCFP similarly has\nevidenced its intent to proceed in both the Eastern and Middle Districts absent consolidation in a\nsingle district.  Id. (DE 58).  In light of the parties’ clear intent to pursue and protect their interests\nwherever necessary, the court concurs with the Berger plaintiffs, “judicial efficiency would be\nserved by having [all actions in the Eastern and Middle District concerning the Act] consolidated\nand tried before the same tribunal.”  Id. (DE 50 at 2). \n21\nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 27   Filed 06/29/16   Page 21 of 22\n\nBerger and NCFP are transferred to the Middle District for all the reasons outlined above. \nA transfer will give both sides the opportunity to attack or defend the Act with a full arsenal of legal\ntheories.  Resolution of this dispute needs such an arrangement.  Civil Rule 1 compels it.  The public\ninterest requires it. \nCONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, the court DENIES the Berger plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate case\nnumber 5:16-CV-240-FL with case number 5:16-CV-238-BO.  Berger, 5:16-CV-240-FL (DE 7). \nLikewise, the court DENIES NCFP’s motion to consolidate case number 5:16-CV-245-FL with case\nnumber 5:16-CV-238-BO.  NCFP, 5:16-CV-245-FL (DE 12). \nOn its own initiative, having heard from the parties further at hearing and conference June\n21, 2016, the court TRANSFERS case number 5:16-CV-240-FL and case number 5:16-CV-245-FL\nto the Middle District.  The clerk of court is DIRECTED immediately to transmit a certified copy\nof this order and associated case files to John S. Brubaker, Clerk of Court, United States District\nCourt for the Middle District of North Carolina, and thereafter close these cases. \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of June, 2016.\n_____________________________\nLOUISE W.

When  people  find  themselves  in  the  intimate  settings  of  public \nbathrooms, locker rooms, or showers, they expect to encounter only other people of \nthe  same  biological  sex.  Until  very  recently,  that  simple  expectation  of  bodily \nprivacy would have been taken for granted. Yet when North Carolina sought to \nprotect  that  expectation  in  law—by  enacting  the  “Public  Facilities  Privacy  and \nSecurity Act” (the “Act”), commonly known as HB2—a torrent of vicious criticism \nwas unleashed against the State, its officials, and its citizens. The abuse has now \nreached its apex with the unprecedented threats by the United States Department \nof Justice (“Department”), the defendant here. Last week, the Department sent \nletters  to  North  Carolina  public  officials  and  agencies  informing  them  that,  by \ncomplying  with  the  Act,  they  were  engaging  in  a  “pattern  or  practice”  of \ndiscrimination  in  violation  of  three  federal  civil  rights  laws.  They  were  bluntly \nordered to repudiate the Act within five calendar days—that is, by today—or else \nface enforcement actions that would drastically impact North Carolina, including \nthe potentially catastrophic elimination of more than two billion dollars in federal \nfunding. Instead of meekly complying, plaintiffs—the leaders of both chambers of \nthe North Carolina General Assembly—have filed this declaratory judgment action. \n2.  A declaratory judgment is urgently needed for two basic reasons. First, \nit is needed to vindicate the sovereign right of North Carolina’s citizens to decide \nhow best to protect their own bodily privacy and dignity in intimate public settings. \nSecond, it is needed to instruct the Department in no uncertain terms that its \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 2 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\noverbearing abuse of executive authority flouts our Constitution’s limitations on \nfederal power and tramples on the sovereign dignity of the States and their citizens. \n3.   The  ideological  extremity—and  utter  unworkability—of  the \nDepartment’s position on the issues in this case is astonishing.  Unlike the people of \nNorth Carolina, the Department believes that the only valid approach to issues of \ngender dysphoria is to allow anyone to use any communal public bathroom, locker \nroom, or shower based solely on that person’s self-declared “gender identity.” Never \nmind  that  no  federal  statute  or  regulation  remotely  requires  the  Department’s \npolicy.  Never mind that the Department’s policy will inevitably lead to women and \ngirls  in  public  changing  facilities  encountering  individuals  who,  whatever  their \ngender identity, still have fully functional male genitals.  Never mind that the \nDepartment’s policy, on its face, demands that North Carolina allow biologically \nmale  prison  inmates  who  identify  as  females  to  take  showers  with  biologically \nfemale  inmates—which,  besides  being  absurd  and  dangerous,  also  violates  the \nDepartment’s own federal prison regulations. Apparently, the Department believes \nthat  these  obvious  social  costs  are  outweighed  by  the  policy’s  purported \npsychological benefits to persons of conflicted gender identity. \n4.  The people of North Carolina came to a different and far more sensible \nconclusion, one they enacted in the law at issue in this case. Despite being grossly \nmischaracterized in the media, the Act does not embody hostility towards those \nwhose gender identity differs from their biological sex. To the contrary, the Act \nspecifically allows a flexible system of single-occupancy facilities for persons who do \n2(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 3 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nnot wish to use public facilities designated for their biological sex. The Act also \nleaves  in  place  existing  provisions  allowing  a  person  to  obtain  a  sex-change \noperation, make a corresponding change to their birth certificate, and then use the \npublic  facilities  consistent  with  their  new  anatomy.  And  the  Act  allows  private \nbusinesses and other entities to determine their own bathroom policies—including, \nif they wish, policies closer to the Department’s views. \n5.  But the Act also reflects concern and compassion for the many North \nCarolina residents—especially girls and women—who do not wish to be in close \nproximity to persons with genitals characteristic of the opposite sex when using \npublic restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.  Those people reasonably believe that \na policy allowing people of the opposite biological sex into those spaces would be an \nassault on their dignity, privacy, and safety, and an affront to the legitimate and \nlongstanding privacy expectations of all North Carolinians.  That is why, in publicly \nowned facilities, the Act simply requires that everyone—regardless of their “gender \nidentity” use the facilities that correspond to their current anatomy. \n6.  In short, the Act is not, as it has been mischaracterized in the press, an \n“anti-transgender” law. It is, rather, a law that promotes both privacy and safety, \nwhile  accommodating  the  legitimate  interests  of  persons  with  conflicts  between \ntheir biological and gender identities. \n7.  Nonetheless, in a series of highly publicized and unusual letters sent to \nNorth  Carolina  officials  and  agencies  last  week,  the  Department  announced  its \n“determination” that the Act, on its face, violates three federal civil rights statutes—\n3(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 4 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nTitle VII, Title IX, and the Violence Against Women Act. As explained more fully \nelsewhere  in  this  Complaint,  the  legal  theories  reflected  in  the  Department’s \ndetermination letters are gravely flawed. For example, those theories all rest on the \nimplausible  premise  that  a  privacy  policy  expressly  designed  to  avoid  making \ndistinctions based on gender identity—by relying on anatomy instead—nonetheless \n“facially” discriminates on the basis of gender identity.  That is nonsensical. \n8.  More  important  for  present  purposes,  the  Department’s \n“determination” that the Act violates these civil rights laws represents an all-out \nassault, not only on the sovereign right of North Carolinians to determine their own \npolicies regarding public bath and shower facilities, but on the right of every other \nState and local government to do the same. It is a remarkable act of executive \noverreach, one that unnecessarily insists on political correctness at the expense of \nprivacy and safety for other vulnerable citizens, especially women and girls. \n9.  Relatedly, the Department’s “determination” is also an assault on the \nwhole system of single-sex bathrooms that, precisely because of privacy concerns, \nhas been an accepted part of our Nation’s social compact since time out of mind. As \na legal matter, if a biologically male individual can access a women’s bathroom \nbased on a claim of “gender identity,” then any males can gain access on the same \nkind  of  claim,  regardless  of  whether  they  “identify”  as  male  or  female:  If \ndiscrimination  based  on  “gender  identity”  is  unlawful  when  the  person  seeking \naccess identifies as a female, then it must be equally unlawful when that person \nidentifies  as  a  male.  Furthermore,  as  a  practical  matter,  if  owners  of  public \n4(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 5 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nbathrooms, lockers, and shower facilities cannot exclude persons with male genitals \nfrom women’s bathrooms, soon enough the public will sensibly demand that single-\nsex bathrooms be abandoned altogether in favor of single-occupancy facilities. \n10.  To be sure, owners of private bath, locker, and shower facilities may \ndecide to move in that direction on their own. But state taxpayers should not be \nforced to shoulder the enormous costs of such a transition at the behest of federal \nofficials who offer nothing more than policy arguments masquerading as law. Nor \nshould innocent state residents be forced to endure the assault on their privacy that \npolicy would produce in the interim. \n11.  In sum, declaratory relief is urgently needed in this case. It is needed \nto protect the sovereignty of North Carolina’s people to set public policy on sensitive \nand  controversial  matters  of  bodily  privacy  and  security.  It  is  needed  to  shield \nNorth  Carolina  from  an  open-ended  threat  of  a  potentially  catastrophic  loss  of \nfederal funding based on nothing more than the Department’s novel and untested \nmisreading of longstanding federal requirements. And it is needed to clarify that \nfederal officials abuse their authority—and violate the Constitution—when they \nperemptorily order a sovereign State to abandon properly enacted legislation, as if \nNorth Carolina were nothing more than a tributary of the federal government. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the action \narises under the United States Constitution and federal law. \n5(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 6 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n13.  The  Court  may  enter  declaratory  relief  and  any  other  appropriate \nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and § 2202. \n14.  The Court may review agency action and enter declaratory and other \nappropriate relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-706. \n15.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part \nof the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this judicial district. \n16.  Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because, in this action \nagainst officers and agencies of the United States, a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this judicial district and because \nthe Plaintiffs reside in this district and no real property is involved in this action.  \nPARTIES \n17.  Plaintiffs Phil Berger and Tim Moore serve as President pro tempore of \nthe  North  Carolina  Senate  and  as  Speaker  of  the  North  Carolina  House  of \nRepresentatives, respectively. President pro tempore Berger and Speaker Moore \nlead  the  two  chambers  of  the  North  Carolina  General  Assembly,  which  is \nconstitutionally  tasked  with  budgeting  for  the  operation  of  all  facets  of  state \ngovernment and with enacting laws for the health, safety, and welfare of North \nCarolinians. Moreover, under North Carolina law, President Berger and Speaker \nMoore “jointly have standing to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly as a \nparty in any judicial proceeding challenging a North Carolina statute or provision of \nthe North Carolina Constitution.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-72.2-2. \n6(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 7 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n18.

Defendant Loretta E. Lynch is the United States Attorney General. In \nthis  capacity  she  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  management  of  the \nDepartment. She is sued in her official capacity only. \n20.  Defendant  Vanita  Gupta  is  a  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Attorney \nGeneral at the United States Department of Justice and an official of the Civil \nRights Division of the United States Department of Justice.

She \nhas been sued in her official capacity only. \nFACTS \nI.  THE ACT \n21.  On March 23, 2016, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed \nthe “Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act” (the “Act”), commonly known as \nHB2. 2015 Bill Text NC H.B. 2B (Mar. 23, 2016), amending N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-\n47. \n22.  As relevant here, the Act requires that a “multiple occupancy restroom \nor  changing  facility”  operated  by  any  “public  agency”  in  North  Carolina  be \n7(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 8 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n“designated  for  and  only  used  by  persons  based  on  their  biological  sex.”  HB2, \n§ 1.3(B). \n23.   “Biological sex” is defined as “[t]he physical condition of being male or \nfemale, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.” Id. § 1.3(A)(1). \n24.  A “multiple occupancy restroom or changing facility” is defined as “[a] \nfacility designed or designated to be used by more than one person at a time where \npersons may be in various states of undress in the presence of other persons” and \n“may include, but is not limited to, a restroom, locker room, changing room, or \nshower room.” Id. § 1.3(A)(3). \n25.  A “public agency” includes executive branch agencies; the legislative \nand judicial branches; political subdivisions; local and municipal governments; all \nstate agencies, boards, offices and departments under the direction and control of a \nmember of the council of state; and local boards of education. Id. § 1.3(4)(A)-(H); \n§ 1.2. \n26.  The Act, however, does not apply to any “single occupancy bathroom or \nchanging facility,” which is defined as “[a] facility designed or designated to be used \nby only one person at a time where persons may be in various states of undress,” \nand  includes  “a  single  stall  restroom  designated  as  unisex  or  for  use  based  on \nbiological sex.” Id. § 1.3(A)(5); § 1.2(A)(3). \n27.  In  fact,  the  Act  expressly  allows  public  agencies  to  “provid[e] \naccommodations such as single occupancy bathroom or changing facilities upon a \nperson’s request due to special circumstances[.]” Id. § 1.3(C); see also id. § 1.2(C) \n8(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 9 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n(providing that “[n]othing in this section shall prohibit local boards of education \nfrom providing accommodations such as single occupancy bathrooms or changing \nfacilities  or  controlled  use  of  faulty  facilities  upon  a  request  due  to  special \ncircumstances”). \n28.  On April 12, 2016, Governor McCrory issued Executive Order No. 93, \nentitled  “To  Protect  Privacy  and  Equality.”  Among  other  things,  the  Order  (1) \naffirmed that “private businesses can set their own rules for their own restroom, \nlocker room and shower facilities”; (2) confirmed that multiple-occupancy restroom, \nlocker rooms, and shower facilities in cabinet agencies must comply with the Act; \nbut  (3)  emphasized  that  “all  cabinet  agencies  shall  provide  a  reasonable \naccommodation of a single occupancy restroom, locker room or shower facility upon \nrequest due to special circumstances,” and encouraged all “council of state agencies, \ncities, counties, the University of North Carolina System and the North Carolina \nCommunity College System” to make similar accommodations where practicable.  \nII.  THE DEPARTMENT’S “DETERMINATION” LETTERS \n29.  On May 4, 2016, the Department, through its Civil Rights Division, \nsent  a  letter  to  North  Carolina  Governor  Patrick  McCrory  (the  “McCrory \nDetermination Letter”). \n30.  The McCrory Determination Letter stated that the Department had \n“determined” and “concluded” that, as a result of complying with the Act, Governor \nMcCrory and the State of North Carolina were “in violation of Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964” because the State was “engaging in a pattern or practice of \n9(cid:1) \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 10 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\ndiscrimination against transgender state employees and both you, in your official \ncapacity, and the State are engaging in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full \nenjoyment of Title VII rights by transgender employees of public agencies.” \n31.  The  McCrory  Determination  Letter  explained  that  the  Department \nhad adopted the view that Title VII “applie[s] to discrimination against transgender \nindividuals based on sex, including gender identity,” and that Title VII requires \n“[a]ccess to sex-segregated restrooms and other workplace facilities consistent with \ngender identity.”  The letter further stated that under Title VII such “access … is a \nterm, condition, or privilege of employment.” \n32.  The McCrory Letter concluded that “H.B. 2 ... is facially discriminatory \nagainst transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender \nemployees, whose gender identity does not match their ‘biological sex,’ as defined by \nH.B. 2, differently from similarly situated non-transgender employees” (emphasis \nadded).  The letter further informed the Governor that, given the State’s “pattern \nand practice” of Title VII discrimination, the Attorney General “may apply to the \nappropriate court for an order that will ensure compliance with Title VII.” \n33.  Finally, the McCrory Determination Letter ordered the Governor to \n“advise” the Department “no later than close of business on May 9, 2016” whether \nhe would “remedy these violations of Title VII, including by confirming that the \nState will not comply with or implement H.B. 2, and that it has notified employees \nof  the  State  and  public  agencies  that,  consistent  with  federal  law,  they  are \n10(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 11 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\npermitted  to  access  bathrooms  and  other  facilities  consistent  with  their  gender \nidentity.” \n34.  Also  on  May  4,  2016,  the  Department,  through  its  Civil  Rights \nDivision,  sent  a  letter  to  North  Carolina  Department  of  Public  Safety  (“DPS”) \nSecretary Frank Perry (the “Perry Determination Letter”). \n35.  The Perry Determination Letter “concluded” that the North Carolina \nDPS was in violation of Title VII, for the same reasons as those outlined in the \nMcCrory Determination Letter.  \n36.  In addition, the Perry Determination Letter “concluded” that DPS, as a \nreceiver of federal funds from the Office on Violence Against Women (“OVW”) “is in \nviolation of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013” (“VAWA”).  \n37.  The  Perry  Determination  Letter  went  on  to  allege  that  compliance \nwith VAWA requires that any “individual” in “buildings controlled or managed by \nDPS  or  its  sub-recipients”—buildings  which  would  obviously  include  prisons \nthroughout  the  State—be  permitted  “to  access  bathrooms  and  other  facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity.” \n38.  Finally, the letter ordered Secretary Perry to “advise” the Department \n“no later than close of business on May 9, 2016” whether DPS has “remedied these \nviolations to comply fully with Title VII and VAWA, including by confirming that \nDPS will not comply with H.B. 2, and that it has notified individuals and employees \nat facilities controlled or managed by DPS or its sub-recipients that, consistent with \n11(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 12 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nfederal law, they are permitted to access bathrooms and other facilities consistent \nwith their gender identity.” \n39.  Also  on  May  4,  2016,  the  Department,  through  its  Civil  Rights \nDivision,  sent  a  letter  to  the  President  of  the  University  of  North  Carolina, \nMargaret Spellings (the “UNC Determination Letter”).  \n40.  The  UNC  Determination  Letter  “determined”  that  UNC  was  in \nviolation of Title VII and VAWA, for the same reasons as those outlined in the \nMcCrory and Perry Determination Letters.  \n41.  In addition, the UNC Determination Letter “determined” that UNC \nwas in violation of Title IX because of UNC’s compliance with the Act. \n42.  Finally,  the  UNC  Determination  Letter  ordered  UNC  President \nMargaret Spellings to “advise” the Department “no later than close of business on \nMay 9, 2016” whether UNC has “remedied these violations to comply fully with \nTitle IX and VAWA, as well as its obligations as an employer under Title VII, \nincluding by . . . advising the public, including UNC students, employees, and third \nparties that, in accordance with federal law, individuals are permitted to access \nUNC restrooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identity.” The UNC \nDetermination Letter threatened “enforcement action” if UNC failed to comply with \nthe Department’s order. \n43.  The  Department’s  letters  are  calculated,  not  only  to  prevent  North \nCarolina  public  officials  from  enforcing  or  implementing  the  Act,  but  also  to \npressure the North Carolina General Assembly into repealing the Act.  Accordingly, \n12(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 13 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nthe Department’s letters harm these plaintiffs as well as other members of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nIII.  THE  DEPARTMENT’S  LETTERS  CONSTITUTE  FINAL  AGENCY \nACTION UNDER THE APA.  \n44.  The  Department  of  Justice  is  a  federal  agency  for  purposes  of  the \nAdministrative Procedures Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 701(b). \n45.  Under the APA, a court may review agency decisions that constitute \n“final agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704. \n46.  Generally,  an  agency  action  is  final  when  it  “mark[s]  the \n‘consummation’  of  the  agency’s  decisionmaking  process”  and  [is]  one  by  which \n‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which 'legal consequences will \nflow[.]’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal citations omitted). \n47.  Final  agency  action  may  take  the  form  of  a  letter  announcing  the \nagency’s position on a substantive legal matter.  “[A]n agency may not avoid judicial \nreview merely by choosing the form of a letter to express its definitive position on a \ngeneral question of statutory interpretation.\"  Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. United States \nEPA, 801 F.2d 430, 438 n.9 (1986); accord CSI Aviation Servs. v. US DOT, 637 F.3d \n408, 412 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Ciba-Geigy).   \n48.  Indeed, “a letter from an agency official stating the agency’s position \nand threatening enforcement action constitute[s] final agency action[.]”  Barrick \nGoldstrike Mines, Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2000); see also CSI \nAviation Servs., 637 F.3d at 412 (finding final agency action where DOT “warning \nletter” constituted a “definitive statement of the agency’s legal position”).  That is \n13(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 14 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nespecially  true  where  the  letter  “declare[s]  in  no  uncertain  terms”  the  agency’s \nposition on “a purely legal” question of “statutory interpretation.”  CSI Aviation \nServs., 637 F.3d at 412  \n49.  Yet another indication that such action is final is when an actor’s “only \nalternative to obtaining judicial review is to violate [the agency’s] directives, … and \nthen defend an enforcement proceeding.”  Barrick Goldstrike Mines, 215 F.3d at 49; \nsee also CSI Aviation Servs., 637 F.3d at 412 (finding final agency action where \nDOT “cease and desist” letter “put the [plaintiff] to the painful choice between costly \ncompliance and the risk of prosecution at an uncertain point in the future”).  And \nthat is especially true when the consequences of not complying with the agency \ndemand are great. See, e.g., CSI Aviation Servs., 637 F.3d at 412 (finding final \nagency  action  where  DOT  enforcement  letter  “imposed  an  immediate  and \nsignificant  burden  on  [the  recipient]”  and  “cast  a  cloud  of  uncertainty  over  the \nviability of [the recipient’s] ongoing business”). \n50.  The  Department’s  Determination  Letters  to  McCrory,  Perry,  and \nSpellings constitute reviewable final agency action under the APA. \n51.  All three letters reflect a settled and definitive agency position. The \nletters note that the Department has “concluded” and “determined” that the State of \nNorth Carolina, and its public agencies and officials, are actively violating federal \nlaw.  \n52.  All three letters unambiguously threaten enforcement action against \nNorth  Carolina  and  its  public  agencies  and  officials  absent  compliance.  Each \n14(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 15 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nexplains that the Attorney General—who is responsible for actions taken by the \nDepartment, including the letters—may apply for a court order to seek enforcement \nof the federal statutes at issue absent compliance by North Carolina and its public \nagencies and officials.  \n53.  All three letters indicate the Department’s clear and settled position \nthat,  absent  compliance  by  the  State  and  its  public  agencies  and  officials,  the \nDepartment’s next step is not to seek further discussions or commence a factual \ninvestigation, but rather to bring an enforcement action.  \n54.  The letters unambiguously alter the legal positions of North Carolina, \nand its public agencies and officials, by putting them to the choice of ceasing to \nenforce the Act or facing a federal enforcement proceeding.  \n55.  The letters directly harm the State and its public agencies and officials \nby requiring them to yield their responsibility as officers of a sovereign state to \nenforce the Act, or face federal enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, the letters \ndirectly  harm  plaintiffs  by  disrupting  the  work  of  the  North  Carolina  General \nAssembly in safeguarding the privacy and safety of North Carolina’s citizens and in \nestablishing the budget for North Carolina’s public agencies and programs. \n56.  The  letters  take  a  definitive  position  on  a  purely  legal  question  of \nstatutory interpretation.  None of the letters suggest that any additional factual \ninquiry needs to take place. Moreover, the letters assert that the Act violates the \nrelevant federal laws, not just as applied in particular circumstances, but facially. \n15(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 16 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n57.  Finally, as noted, the letters are calculated, not only to prevent North \nCarolina  public  officials  from  enforcing  or  implementing  the  Act,  but  also  to \npressure the North Carolina General Assembly into repealing the Act.  Accordingly, \nthe  Department’s  letters  harm  the  plaintiffs  as  well  as  other  members  of  the \nGeneral Assembly.(cid:1) \nIV.  THE DETERMINATION LETTERS’ ADVERSE EFFECTS  \n58.  The  Department’s  stunningly  overbroad  and  conclusory \ndeterminations that the Act “facially violates” Title VII, Title IX, and VAWA place \nplaintiffs and the State of North Carolina in an intolerable position that threatens \nto  disrupt  the  integrity  of  its  public  agencies,  the  financial  stability  of  its \nuniversities  and  school  systems,  and,  most  profoundly,  the  ability  of  its  public \nofficials to provide for the common good of North Carolina citizens. \n59.   On  the  one  hand,  if  plaintiffs  and  other  legislators  in  the  North \nCarolina General Assembly and the State’s public agencies and officials resist the \nDepartment’s  demands  and  continue  implementing  the  will  of  the  citizenry  as \nexpressed in the Act, the State’s school systems could lose hundreds of millions of \ndollars of federal education funds.  Such a loss would not only impair the teaching \nand research mission of UNC, but would also affect K-12 education throughout the \nState.  Local schools would likely be forced to curtail programs, fire teachers and \nincrease class sizes—all to the detriment of the State’s hundreds of thousands of \nschoolchildren.  All this because the federal government, if the Department carries \n16(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 17 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nout its threat, would refuse to return to the people of North Carolina federal tax \ndollars that those very people have paid into the federal treasury.  \n60.  Similarly, the Department’s demands carry a threat to cut off over \n$100  million  in  annual  federal  funding  currently  provided  to  the  State’s \nDepartment of Public Safety.  Here again, these are funds that North Carolina \ncitizens have already paid into the federal treasury in the form of tax payments.  \nYet the Department’s Determination Letters implicitly threaten to withhold those \nfunds—which could lead to more crowding of North Carolina’s prisons, reduced \nnumbers of prisons guards, and thus an increased risk of crime both inside and \noutside those prisons. \n61.  On  the  other  hand,  if  plaintiffs  and  other  legislators  in  the  North \nCarolina  General  Assembly,  or  any  of  the  State’s  public  agencies  and  officials, \ncapitulate to the Department’s demands, this would subject the people of North \nCarolina to the very risks the Act was designed to prevent.  As previously explained, \nthe Department demands that the State allow anyone to use any public bathroom, \nlocker room or shower based solely on that person’s self-declared gender “identity.”  \nSuch a policy would necessarily lead to partially or fully unclothed women and girls \ncoming into close proximity and visual contact with individuals who, whatever their \ngender identity, nonetheless display male sex organs.   \n62.  Such a policy would also create an opportunity for sexual predators of \nany sexual orientation to abuse the policy to facilitate their predation.  And in so \ndoing, such a policy would violate settled, legitimate expectations of privacy and \n17(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 18 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nsafety that have long prevailed in the State.  Indeed, under the Department’s legal \ntheory, a biological male found in a woman’s restroom has a legal right to be there if \nhe merely claims to “self-identify” as female.  And a police officer summoned to \nremove such a person in a public restroom, locker room, or shower would have no \npractical way to determine quickly whether the person is acting in bad faith.  \n63.  Before  long,  moreover,  such  a  policy  would  likely  provoke  a  public \noutcry demanding that single-sex facilities be abandoned altogether and replaced \nwith single-user bathroom, shower and locker facilities.  That in turn would likely \nforce  the  plaintiffs  and  other  members  of  the  General  Assembly  to  authorize \nfunding to retrofit countless public buildings, at a taxpayer cost of hundreds of \nmillions if not billions of dollars.   \n64.  In  the  prison  setting,  the  consequences  of  capitulation  to  the \nDepartment’s  demands  would  be  equally  if  not  more  stark.    The  Department’s \ndemand with respect to prisons is not limited to prison employees, but extends to \ninmates  as  well—all  “individuals”  in  those  prisons.    If,  as  the  Department \napparently  insists,  prison  officials  cannot  “discriminate”  based  on  anatomy  in \ngranting access to bath, locker and shower facilities, then they cannot, for example, \nexclude biological males from female bath and shower facilities.   And that inability \nwould  create  an  obvious  risk  of  more  sexual  assaults  and  increased  voluntary \nsexual  activity—thereby  leading  to  more  prison  pregnancies  and  sexually \ntransmitted diseases.  These effects would likewise impose massive additional costs \n18(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 19 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\non the State’s prison system—costs that would require further action by plaintiffs \nand other members of the General Assembly.   \n65.  Nor would the effects of a capitulation be limited to publicly owned \nbath, locker-room and shower facilities.  If as the Department contends, Title VII \nrequires that anyone be allowed to use any such facility based on their asserted \nsexual  orientation,  that  rule  necessarily  applies  to  private  as  well  as  public \nemployers and, indeed, businesses generally.  There is only one Title VII standard.  \nAnd if the Department succeeds in imposing its view of Title VII on the State itself, \nit will be only a short step to imposing that view on virtually every owner of bath, \nlocker  and  shower  facilities  throughout  the  State  and,  indeed,  throughout  the \nNation.   \n66.  In  all  these  ways,  if  North  Carolina  and  its  public  agencies  and \nofficials, including plaintiffs, were to capitulate to the Department’s demands, they \nwould violate the trust of the North Carolina citizenry to protect their privacy and \nsafety.             \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM ONE: \nThe Act Does Not Facially Violate Title VII, Properly Construed \n67.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters alleged in paragraphs 1 through 66 and \nincorporate them herein. \n68.  For  several  reasons,  the  Department’s  determination  that  the  Act \nfacially violates Title VII is wrong as a matter of both law and proper procedure.  \n19(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 20 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nThis will be established in greater detail (with appropriate citations) in briefing on \nthe merits.  But following are a few of the salient reasons.   \n69.  First, at the threshold, the Department’s premise that the Act “facially \ndiscriminates” on the basis of gender “identity” is patently incorrect.  On the face of \nthe Act, a person’s ability to use a particular multi-occupancy bathroom, locker \nroom or shower facility depends, not on the person’s gender identity, but on the \nperson’s “biological sex”—as determined by the person’s birth certificate.  See HB2 \n§§ 1.2, 1.3.  Accordingly, if there is any “discrimination” here, it is discrimination on \nthe basis of biological sex, not gender identity.  And, although a “separate but \nequal”  approach  is  clearly  inappropriate  with  respect  to  racial  classifications, \nseparating the sexes based on legitimate physical and anatomical characteristics \nhas always been viewed as consistent with Title VII and other non-discrimination \nstatutes – especially in the context of bathrooms, locker rooms and showers.  \n70.  Moreover, North Carolina law expressly allows citizens to obtain sex \nchange operations, and then change the sex listed on their birth certificates.  See \nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 130A-118. Thus, for example, a person who was a male at \nbirth  but  who  “identifies”  as  female  has  the  ability  to  gain  access  to  women’s \nbathrooms  if  (s)he  so  chooses.    Accordingly,  there  simply  is  no  “facial \ndiscrimination” against anyone based on their gender identity.   \n71.  Second,  and  more  fundamentally,  the  Department  is  incorrect  in \ncontending  that  Title  VII’s  prohibition  on  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  “sex” \nextends  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  “gender  identity”  or  even  sexual \n20(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 21 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\norientation.  Although that position has recently (and controversially) been adopted \nby  the  current  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  for  claims  brought \nbefore that agency, the same position has been uniformly rejected by every federal \ncircuit court to consider it, and by virtually all of the district courts as well. (The \ncourt cases cited in the Department’s letters deal with sex and gender stereotyping, \nnot gender identity or sexual orientation per se, and are therefore not controlling on \nthe questions here.) Nor is there any indication in Title VII’s language or legislative \nhistory of any purpose on Congress’s part to reach alleged discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity.  \n72.  Third, because Congress’s decision to extend Title VII to the states \nrested  solely  upon  Section  5  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  any  requirements \nimposed on the states under the guise of that statute must be directed at preventing \nor remedying violations of the federal Constitution, and must be both “congruent \nwith and proportional” to that goal.  Yet the Department does not even contend—\nnor  could  it  contend—that  people  with  a  gender  identity  different  from  their \nbiological sex are a protected class, much less that extending Title VII to laws such \nas the Act is congruent and proportional to the goal of preventing unconstitutional \ndiscrimination  against  members  of  that  class.    Accordingly,  given  that  it  is \ngrounded solely in the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VII cannot constitutionally be \napplied  to  the  Act  or  similar  laws,  and  therefore  cannot  constitutionally  be \nconstrued in the manner the Department contends.  \n21(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 22 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n73.  Fourth, in any event, the federal government lacks the constitutional \nauthority to preempt the States’ efforts to protect the privacy and safety of residents \nusing State-owned bathroom, locker room and shower facilities.  Providing such \nprotection in State-owned facilities falls squarely within the police power protected \nfrom federal encroachment by the enumerated powers doctrine and recognized in \nthe Tenth Amendment.  And the use of such facilities by people who “identify” with \na  gender  other  than  their  biological  sex  cannot  possibly  have  an  impact  on \ninterstate commerce sufficient to justify federal regulation under Article I.  Indeed, \nthe Department’s determination under Title VII constitutes an improper attempt to \ncommandeer State-owned property in pursuit of a (dubious) federal policy.  For that \nreason  too  Title  VII  cannot  constitutionally  be  construed  in  the  manner  the \nDepartment contends.  \n74.  Finally, even if the Act could hypothetically violate Title VII (properly \nconstrued) in some of its possible applications, it cannot possibly be unlawful in all \nof its possible applications, and for that reason cannot be facially unlawful.  For \nexample, even under the Department’s interpretation of Title VII, the Act would be \nlawful when applied to prevent a known male sexual predator from falsely claiming \nto “identify” as female so that he can enter a women’s bathroom and prey upon a \nlittle girl whom he has seen enter alone.  Surely the Department’s interpretation of \nTitle VII would not require that people making knowingly false claims of gender \nidentity (and claims that are known to authorities to be false) be allowed to enter a \nbathroom or shower designated for people of the opposite sex.  Because the Act \n22(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 23 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nprevents entry into facilities designated for people of the opposite sex by those \nmaking  knowingly  false  claims  of  gender  identity  in  addition  to  those  making \ngenuine  claims  of  gender  identity,  the  Act  clearly  is  not  unlawful  in  all of  its \napplications, and therefore is not unlawful on its face.   \n75.  For all these reasons, the Department’s determination that the Act \nfacially violates Title VII is both “contrary to law” and “arbitrary and capricious” \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  Furthermore, the Department violated the APA \nand  the  due  process  rights  of  the  plaintiffs  and  the  State  by  reaching  its \ndetermination without any advance notice or opportunity to be heard. \nCLAIM TWO: \nThe Act Does Not Facially Violate Title IX, Properly Construed  \n76.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters alleged in paragraphs 1 through 75 and \nincorporate them herein. \n77.  For  several  reasons,  the  Department’s  determination  that  the  Act \nfacially violates Title IX is wrong as a matter of both law and proper procedure.  \nThis will be established in greater detail (with appropriate citations) in briefing on \nthe merits.  But following are a few of the salient reasons. \n78.  First, at the threshold, the Department’s premise that the Act “facially \ndiscriminates” on the basis of gender “identity” is patently incorrect.  On the face of \nthe Act, a person’s ability to use a particular multi-occupancy bathroom, locker \nroom or shower facility depends, not on the person’s gender identity, but on the \nperson’s “biological sex”—as determined by the person’s birth certificate.  See HB2 \n§§ 1.2, 1.3.  Accordingly, if there is any “discrimination” here, it is discrimination on \n23(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 24 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nthe basis of biological sex, not gender identity.  And, although a “separate but \nequal”  approach  is  clearly  inappropriate  with  respect  to  racial  classifications, \nseparating the sexes based on legitimate physical and anatomical characteristics \nhas always been viewed as consistent with Title IX and other non-discrimination \nstatutes – especially in the context of bathrooms, locker rooms and showers. \n79.  This conclusion is particularly evident with respect to Title IX, which \nboth by statute and regulation expressly authorizes the provision of facilities or \nprograms segregated by sex, provided each is comparable for males and females. \nSee, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1686 (allowing educational institutions to “maintain[ ] separate \nliving  facilities  for  the  different  sexes”);  34  C.F.R.  §  106.32  (allowing  funding \nrecipients to “provide separate housing on the basis of sex,” provide those facilities \nare “[p]roportionate in quantity” and “comparable in quality and cost”); 34 C.F.R. § \n106.34 (allowing “separation of students by sex” within physical education classes \nand certain sports “the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact”). \nMost pertinent here, longstanding Title IX regulations issued by the Department of \nEducation in 1975, and reaffirmed in 1980, expressly allow recipients of federal \nfunding to “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of \nsex,” provided that the facilities provided for “students of one sex” are “comparable” \nto the facilities provided for “students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n80.  In light of that, the Department is plainly wrong to conclude that, by \ncomplying with the Act, the plaintiffs are thereby engaging in a “pattern or practice \nof  discrimination”  under  Title  IX.  By  requiring  public  multiple-occupancy \n24(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 25 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nbathrooms, locker rooms, and showers to be segregated by “biological” sex, the Act \nhas  done  nothing  remotely  out  of  line  with  the  clear  statutory  and  regulatory \ndirectives in Title IX.  To the contrary, the Act is authorized by the most directly \napplicable Title IX regulation, which allows sex-segregated “toilet[s], locker room[s], \nand shower facilities.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n81.  Second,  and  more  fundamentally,  the  Department  is  incorrect  in \ncontending that Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of “sex” extends \nto discrimination on the basis of “gender identity.” There is no indication in Title \nIX’s  language  or  legislative  history  of  any  purpose  on  Congress’s  part  to  reach \nalleged discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  Furthermore, that view has \nbeen uniformly rejected by every federal circuit court to consider it, and by virtually \nall of the district courts as well. (The court cases cited in the Department’s letters \ndeal with sex and gender stereotyping, not gender identity or sexual orientation per \nse, and are therefore not controlling on the questions here.)  \n82.  Third, the Department compounds its erroneous reading of Title IX by \nrelying on a recent Department of Education “opinion letter” suggesting that Title \nIX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination extends to discrimination based on “gender \nidentity.”  See  Letter  from  James  A.  Ferg-Cadima,  Acting  Deputy  Assistant \nSecretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Dep’t of Education (Jan. 7, 2015). \nThe Department is mistaken.  Even assuming the Fourth Circuit was correct in \ndetermining  recently  that  a  mere  “opinion  letter”  merits  deference,  see G.G. v. \nGloucester County School Board, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 7026 (4th Cir. Jan. 27, \n25(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 26 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n2016), the Department nonetheless cannot prevail here because the opinion letter is \nplainly erroneous, inconsistent with Title IX and its regulations, and would render \nTitle IX unconstitutional.  See id., 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS at 23 (explaining that \nagency interpretation of Title IX regulation merits deference under Auer v. Robbins, \n519 U.S. 452 (1997), unless interpretation is “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with \nthe regulation or statute”); id. at 32 (observing that there was “no constitutional \nchallenge to the regulation or agency interpretation”). \n83.  The  opinion  letter’s  notion  that  “sex”  discrimination  encompasses \n“gender identity” discrimination is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with both \nTitle IX and its implementing regulations. Among other things, it would render \nincoherent Title IX’s longstanding and express allowance of sex-segregated facilities \nand  programs.    More  fundamentally,  the  opinion  letter’s  interpretation  would \nrender Title IX unconstitutional: as explained below, it would require States to \nviolate persons’ constitutional rights to bodily privacy and parents’ constitutional \nrights to direct the education and upbringing of their children; it would violate the \nSpending  Clause  and  the  Tenth  Amendment  by  conditioning  States’  receipt  of \nfederal funds on a novel requirement that no State could have reasonably foreseen; \nand it would violate the constitutional separation of powers by purporting to enact \nnew legislation outside the constraints of Article I of the Constitution. \n84.  Moreover, Gloucester does not purport to decide the actual question at \nissue in this case—namely, whether Title IX itself is facially violated if a State \nlimits  public  multiple-occupancy  restrooms,  changing  facilities,  and  showers  to \n26(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 27 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\npersons of the same biological sex (while permitting a system for accommodating \npersons  with  conflicting  gender  identities  through  single-occupancy  facilities). \nGloucester did not reach that issue (and, indeed, had nothing to do with changing \nfacilities  or  showers  at  all),  but  decided  only  that  a  Department  of  Education \nopinion letter purporting to interpret an implementing regulation under Title IX \nmerits  Auer  deference,  absent  a  showing  that  the  letter  is  plainly  erroneous, \ninconsistent  with  Title  IX,  or  unconstitutional.  Gloucester  remanded  for  further \nproceedings on the Title IX issue, leaving open the ultimate question of whether \nTitle IX facially permits a State to require public multiple-occupancy restrooms, \nchanging facilities, and showers to be segregated by biological sex (while permitting \na  system  for  accommodating  persons  with  conflicting  gender  identities  through \nsingle-occupancy facilities).  \n85.  In addition, the Fourth Circuit’s Gloucester opinion is incorrect. An \nagency  can  impose  new  obligations  or  prohibitions  on  regulated  parties  only \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking—not through a unilateral “opinion letter.”  \nThus,  the  Department  cannot  rely  on  the  “opinion  letter”  to  re-cast  Title  IX’s \nprohibition  on  “sex”  discrimination  as  a  prohibition  on  “gender  identity” \ndiscrimination. Instead, the Department can only rely on the plain meaning of Title \nIX  and  its  implementing  regulations,  which  for  decades  have  unambiguously \npermitted sex-segregated restrooms, changing rooms, and shower facilities.  \n86.  Fourth, the federal government lacks the constitutional authority to \ndeploy the Department’s novel reading of Title IX to preempt the States’ efforts to \n27(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 28 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nprotect the privacy and safety of residents using public bathroom, locker room and \nshower facilities.  Indeed, the Department’s reading of Title IX would compel States \nto violate persons’ constitutional rights to bodily privacy and parents’ constitutional \nrights  to  direct  the  education  and  upbringing  of  their  children  with  respect  to \nmatters of sexuality. The Department’s reading of Title IX would therefore infringe \nthe States’ Tenth Amendment authority to provide for their citizens’ privacy and \nwell-being, and would additionally constitute an unconstitutional commandeering of \nstate property and lawmaking processes. For those reasons, too, Title IX cannot \nconstitutionally be construed in the manner the Department contends. \n87.  Fifth, the Department’s novel reading of Title IX to encompass “gender \nidentity” discrimination would make Title IX run afoul of the Spending Clause and \nthe  Tenth  Amendment.  The  conditions  the  federal  government  attaches  to  the \nStates’ receipt of federal funds must be clear and unambiguous, so that States may \nmake an informed choice about whether to accept the funds. No State could have \nreasonably foreseen that a condition on accepting federal funds prohibiting “sex” \ndiscrimination  would  somehow  evolve  through  unilateral  agency  action  into  a \nprohibition  on  “gender  identity”  discrimination—particularly  when  Title  IX’s \nlongstanding  regulations  expressly  allow  States  to  maintain  sex-segregated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities.  Furthermore, by exposing the State \nto a potentially catastrophic loss of federal funding if the State did not acquiesce in \nthe agency’s novel reading of Title IX, the Department would violate the Tenth \nAmendment.      \n28(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 29 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\n88.  Finally, even if the Act could hypothetically violate Title IX (properly \nconstrued) in some of its possible applications, it cannot possibly be unlawful under \nTitle IX in all of its possible applications, and for that reason cannot be facially \nunlawful.  For example, even under the Department’s interpretation of Title IX, the \nAct would be lawful when applied to prevent a known male sexual predator from \nfalsely claiming to “identify” as female so that he can enter a women’s bathroom \nand prey upon a little girl whom he has seen enter alone.  Surely the Department’s \ninterpretation of Title IX would not require that people making knowingly false \nclaims of gender identity (and claims that are known to authorities to be false) be \nallowed to enter a bathroom or shower designated for people of the opposite gender.  \nBecause the Act prevents entry into facilities designated for people of the opposite \nsex by those making knowingly false claims of gender identity in addition to those \nmaking genuine claims of gender identity, the Act clearly is not unlawful in all of its \napplications, even under the Department’s interpretation of Title IX, and therefore \nis not unlawful on its face. \n89.  For all these reasons, the Department’s determination that the Act \nfacially violates Title IX is both “contrary to law” and “arbitrary and capricious” \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  Furthermore, the Department violated the APA \nand  the  due  process  rights  of  the  plaintiffs  and  the  State  by  reaching  its \ndetermination without any advance notice or opportunity to be heard. \n29(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 30 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nCLAIM THREE: \nThe Act Does Not Facially Violate VAWA, Properly Construed \n90.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters alleged in paragraphs 1 through 89 and \nincorporate them herein. \n91.  For  several  reasons,  the  Department’s  determination  that  the  Act \nfacially violates VAWA is wrong as a matter of both law and proper procedure.  This \nwill be established in greater detail (with appropriate citations) in briefing on the \nmerits.  But following are a few of the salient reasons. \n92.  First, at the threshold, the Department’s premise that the Act “facially \ndiscriminates” on the basis of gender “identity” is patently incorrect.  On the face of \nthe Act, a person’s ability to use a particular multi-occupancy bathroom, locker \nroom or shower facility depends, not on the person’s gender identity, but on the \nperson’s “biological sex”—as determined by the person’s birth certificate.  See HB2 \n§§ 1.2, 1.3.  Accordingly, if there is any “discrimination” here, it is discrimination on \nthe basis of biological sex, not gender identity.  And, although a “separate but \nequal”  approach  is  clearly  inappropriate  with  respect  to  racial  classifications, \nseparating the sexes based on legitimate physical and anatomical characteristics \nhas always been viewed as consistent with VAWA and other non-discrimination \nstatutes – especially in the context of bathrooms, locker rooms and showers. \n93.  Second, VAWA itself dispels any notion that the Act facially violates \nVAWA’s grant conditions. As the Department’s letter fails to note, VAWA explicitly \nallows  funding  recipients  to  consider  an  individual’s  sex  in  establishing  sex-\nsegregated or sex-specific programming. While VAWA does prohibit discrimination \n30(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 31 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nin  funded  programs  on  the  basis  of  “sex”  and  “gender  identity,”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 13925(b)(13)(A), the statute contains an “exception” that allows funded programs \nto consider an individual’s sex “[i]f sex-segregation or sex-specific programming is \nnecessary to the essential operation of a program.” Id. § 13925(b)(13)(B).  A program \ngrantee  satisfies  VAWA  requirements  in  such  cases  “by  providing  comparable \nservices  to  individuals  who  cannot  be  provided  with  the  sex-segregated  or  sex-\nspecific programming.” Id. \n94.  In  light  of  VAWA’s  explicit  safe-harbor  for  sex-segregated  and  sex-\nspecific programs, the Department is plainly wrong to conclude that, by complying \nwith  the  Act,  Perry  and  the  North  Carolina  DPS  are  “in  violation  of  the  non-\ndiscrimination  provision  of  [VAWA].”  By  requiring  public  multiple-occupancy \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and showers in North Carolina correctional facilities to be \nsegregated by “biological” sex, the Act has done nothing remotely out of line with \nthe clear grant conditions in VAWA. To the contrary, the Act is authorized by the \nmost directly applicable VAWA grant condition, which allows grantees to consider \nan individual’s sex where, as here, “sex segregation or sex-specific programming is \nnecessary  to  the  essential  operation  of  a  program.”  Id.    For  reasons  explained \nelsewhere,  and  as  a  matter  of  common  sense,  sex  segregation  in  multi-user \nbathrooms,  locker  rooms  and  shower  facilities  is  “necessary  to  the  essential \noperation” of such facilities.   \n95.  Third, the fact that the alleged VAWA violation in this case concerns \nNorth Carolina prison inmates make the Department’s conclusion astonishing.  The \n31(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 32 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nDepartment’s determination plainly extends, not just to prison employees, but to \nany “individual” in “buildings controlled or managed by DPS or its sub-recipients,” \nand it orders Perry to allow those individuals to “access restrooms and changing \nfacilities that are consistent with their gender identity.”  Thus, by the plain terms of \nits determination letter, the Department has concluded that any North Carolina \ncorrectional  facility  receiving  any  VAWA  funding  must  allow  prison  inmates to \naccess restrooms and changing facilities (as well as showers, which the Department \nfails  to  mention)  consistent  with  their  “gender  identity”  or  else  be  subject  to  a \nDepartment enforcement action. \n96.  The Department cites not a single authority to support its reading of \nVAWA’s  grant  condition,  and  for  good  reason—the  consequences  of  the \nDepartment’s  position  would  fly  in  the  face  of  every  sensible  notion  of  prison \nmanagement, security, and safety.  North Carolina correctional facilities would be \nrequired to allow any biologically male prison inmate whose self-expressed “gender \nidentity” is female to use communal bathrooms, changing facilities, and showers \nwith biologically female prison inmates—and vice-versa. The mere statement of \nthat conclusion is sufficient to refute it.  \n97.  Fourth, the Department’s conclusion that North Carolina correctional \nfacilities violate VAWA by refusing to allow “gender identity” to determine inmate \nuse  of  communal  restrooms,  changing  facilities,  and  showers  contradicts  the \nDepartment’s  own  prison  regulations.    In  regulations  entitled  “Prison  Rape \nElimination Act National Standards,” the Department requires that, in deciding \n32(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 33 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nwhether to assign “a transgender or intersex inmate” to a male or female prison \nfacility,  or  in  making  other  “housing  and  programming  assignments”  for  such \ninmates, the agency “shall consider on a case-by-case basis whether a placement \nwould ensure the inmate’s health and safety, and whether the placement would \npresent management or security problems.” 28 C.F.R. § 115.42(c) (emphasis added). \nFurthermore, the Department’s regulations also require that “[t]ransgender and \nintersex inmates shall be given the opportunity to shower separately from other \ninmates.”  Id.  §  115.42(f)  (emphasis  added).  Neither  of  those  regulations  would \nsurvive the Department’s current view of VAWA, as expressed in its determination \nletter, which would now require inmates to be allowed access restrooms, changing \nfacilities, and showers consistent with their self-professed “gender identity,” quite \napart from any case-by-case assessment of whether such access would impact prison \nsecurity or imperil the inmate’s safety. \n98.  Fifth, if the Department’s conclusion regarding VAWA were correct, \nthen VAWA would be unconstitutional on numerous grounds.  It would violate the \nTenth Amendment by invading the State’s basic constitutional authority to provide \nfor  order  and  safety  in  its  correctional  facilities.  It  would  violate  the  Spending \nClause by placing a condition on the receipt of federal funds that no State could \nhave  remotely  anticipated  when  receiving  the  funds—especially  in  light  of  the \nDepartment’s own regulations. For similar reasons, the Department’s new position \nwould violate the Tenth Amendment by coercing North Carolina to alter the basic \nstructure of its correctional facilities or else lose large amounts of federal prison \n33(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 34 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nfunding.  It  would  also  require  North  Carolina  to  violate  its  own  prisoners’ \nconstitutional rights to bodily privacy and safety and expose them to dangerous \nconditions in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n99.  Finally, even if the Act could hypothetically violate VAWA (properly \nconstrued) in some of its possible applications, it cannot possibly be unlawful in all \nof its possible applications, and for that reason cannot be facially unlawful.  For \nexample, even under the Department’s interpretation of VAWA, the Act would be \nlawful when applied to prevent biologically male prisoner from falsely claiming to \n“identify” as female so that he can enter a communal bathroom, changing facility, or \nshower in order to victimize biologically female prisoners.  Surely the Department’s \ninterpretation  of  VAWA  would  not  require  that  people  making  knowingly  false \nclaims of gender identity (and claims that are known to authorities to be false) be \nallowed to enter a bathroom or shower designated for people of the opposite sex.  \nBecause the Act prevents entry into facilities designated for people of the opposite \nsex by those making knowingly false claims of gender identity in addition to those \nmaking genuine claims of gender identity, the Act clearly is not unlawful in all of its \napplications, even under the Department’s apparent view of VAWA, and therefore is \nnot unlawful on its face. \n100.  For all these reasons, the Department’s determination that the Act \nfacially violates VAWA is both “contrary to law” and “arbitrary and capricious” \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  Furthermore, the Department violated the APA \n34(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 35 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nand  the  due  process  rights  of  the  plaintiffs  and  the  State  by  reaching  its \ndetermination without any advance notice or opportunity to be heard. \nCLAIM FOUR: \nThe Department’s Actions Violate the Separation of Powers in the United \nStates Constitution \n101.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters alleged in paragraphs 1 through 100 and \nincorporate them herein. \n102.  Multiple provisions of the federal Constitution make clear that, if the \nfederal  government  is  to  impose  new  legal  requirements  on  the  States,  those \nrequirements must be imposed by or at the behest of Congress, not by the Executive \nBranch acting on its own.  Those provisions include but are not limited to the \n“vesting” clause of Article I Section 1, the bicameralism and presentment clauses of \nArticle  I  Section  7,  the  “take  care”  clause  of  Article  II  Section  3,  and  the \n“appropriate legislation” provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n103.  The  requirement  that  the  Department’s  “determination”  seeks  to \nimpose upon North Carolina—i.e., a requirement of open “access” to all state-owned \n“sex-segregated  …  facilities  consistent  with  gender  identity”  (McCrory \nDetermination Letter at 1)—is a new legal requirement.  For reasons explained \nabove, that requirement—which would logically extend to every other State and \nvirtually all private employers as well—is simply not found in Title VII, Title IX or \nVAWA.  The Department’s attempt to impose that requirement on North Carolina \non its own is therefore a usurpation of Congress’s exclusive authority under Article I \nof the Constitution, which provides that “all legislative powers herein granted shall \nbe  vested  in  …  Congress.”    Such  action  is  also  a  violation  of  the  President’s \n35(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 36 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nobligation  under  Article  II  Section  3  to  “take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted.” \n104.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  Department’s  determination  that  North \nCarolina and its officials must grant “access to sex-segregated restrooms and other \n[similar] facilities consistent with gender identity” is both “contrary to law” and \n“arbitrary  and  capricious”  within  the  meaning  of  the  APA.    Furthermore,  the \nDepartment violated the APA and the due process rights of the plaintiffs and the \nState by reaching its determination without any advance notice or opportunity to be \nheard. \nCLAIM FIVE: \nThe Department’s Actions Violate the Federalism Guarantees of the United \nStates Constitution \n105.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters alleged in paragraphs 1 through 104 and \nincorporate them herein. \n106.  Several provisions of the federal Constitution also make clear that the \nStates remain independent sovereigns in the federal system, that they joined the \nUnion with their sovereignty—including their traditional police power—intact, and \nthat the federal government is one of limited, enumerated powers.  Those provisions \ninclude but are not limited to Article I section 8, and section 1 of the Thirteenth, \nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments—all of which together delineate specific and \nlimited  subjects  on  which  Congress  may  legislate—and  the  Tenth  Amendment, \nwhich  provides  that  “[t]he  powers  not  delegated  to  the  United  States  by  the \nConstitution,  nor  prohibited  by  it  to  the  States,  are  reserved  to  the  States \nrespectively,  or  to  the  people.”    Aside  from  racial  discrimination,  none  of  those \n36(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 37 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nprovisions authorizes any arm of the federal government to impose requirements for \n“access”  to  state-owned  bathrooms,  locker  rooms  or  shower  facilities,  much  less \nauthorizes the federal government to regulate the manner in which the states seek \nto  protect  the  privacy  and  safety  of  those  using  such  state-owned  facilities.  \nCertainly nothing in the Constitution authorizes any arm of the federal government \nto impose regulations governing access to such facilities on the basis of “gender \nidentity”—a  concept  unknown  to  those  who  wrote  and  ratified  the  relevant \nprovisions of the federal Constitution.   \n107.  The  Act,  by  contrast,  seeks  to  vindicate  the  right  to  sexual  and \nreproductive privacy protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as \nthe right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, also protected by the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  And the Act does so in a manner that is well \nwithin the States’ traditional police power.   \n108.  Because the federal government lacks the constitutional authority to \nregulate North Carolina’s (and the other States’) efforts to protect the privacy and \nsafety of those who use state-owned bath, locker room and shower facilities, the \nDepartment’s attempt to impose the “access” requirement at issue here represents a \nusurpation of the States’ authority over such facilities. \n109.  Relatedly,  the  Constitution’s  federalism  guarantees  constrain  the \nfederal government’s ability to place conditions on the States’ receipt of federal \nfunds  through  legislation  under  the  Spending  Clause  of  Article  I.  The  federal \ngovernment  must  make  its  conditions  on  receipt  of  federal  funds  clear  and \n37(cid:1)  \nCase 5:16-cv-00240-FL   Document 1   Filed 05/09/16   Page 38 of 41\n\n(cid:1)\nunambiguous, so that States may make an informed decision about whether to \naccept  the  funds  and  the  resulting  diminution  in  their  sovereign  authority. \nFurthermore, the federal government may not attach conditions to the receipt or \nretention  of  federal  funding  that  effective  coerce  the  States  into  accepting  the \nconditions. \n110.  Based on those settled principles, the Department’s attempt to impose \nnovel and unforeseeable interpretations of Title IX and VAWA on North Carolina \nconstitutes a violation of the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment. When \nNorth Carolina officials and agencies accepted the conditions originally attached to \nfederal  funding  under  those  statutes,  they  could  not  have  foreseen  the  radical \nchange in those conditions represented by the Department’s recent determination \nletters.  Furthermore,  by  deeming  North  Carolina  in  violation  of  its  novel \nreinterpretation of Title IX and VAWA, the Department has attempted to coerce \nNorth Carolina into complying with the Department’s illegal demand, in violation of \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n111.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  Department’s  determination  that  North \nCarolina and its officials must grant “access to sex-segregated restrooms and other \n[similar] facilities consistent with gender identity” is both “contrary to law” and \n“arbitrary  and  capricious”  within  the  meaning  of  the  APA.
