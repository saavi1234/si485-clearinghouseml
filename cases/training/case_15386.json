    "summary": "<p>On June 12, 2015, three individuals incarcerated and suffering from complications due to Hepatitis C viral infections filed this class action suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs sued the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, claiming violations of the Eighth Amendment, and of Article I &sect; 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the PA Institutional Law Project, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOC had a policy and practice of denying necessary medical care to inmates diagnosed with Hepatitis C. In denying care, the DOC placed the inmates at serious and unnecessary risk for irreparable harm and death. The plaintiffs estimated that 20% of the state's prisoners were infected with Hepatitis C at the time of the lawsuit. The defendants did not authorize treatment with drugs that recently were established to be effective and the new standard of care, and in fact ceased providing treatment altogether. The plaintiffs sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2016, Judge John Padova ordered that the motion for class certification be stayed pending resolution of the defendant's motion to dismiss. On March 21, 2016, Judge Padova issued an order partially granting and partially denying the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2016 WL 1125580. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 3, 2017, and the defendants filed another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on February 8. The court ruled on this motion on August 8, 2017, granting it in part and denying it in part. The court found that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that defendants had been deliberately indifferent, and that portion of the complaint met the standard to survive a motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the allegations of the medical defendants, finding that they were not responsible for creating the DOC's policy and could not be held responsible for it. A number of additional claims were dismissed pursuant to the agreement of the parties. 2017 WL 3394605.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved for summary judgment on October 2, 2017. Meanwhile, the court granted the plaintiffs' renewed motion for class certification on May 24, 2018. The class was certified as all persons who are currently incarcerated in a Pennsylvania DOC facility with a diagnosed condition of Chronic Hepatitis C, who have at least twelve weeks remaining on their sentences, and who have a life expectancy of over a year. 2018 WL 2388665. On July 12, 2018, the court partially granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion with respect to one plaintiffs' personal claims for injunctive relief, the plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief under Article I, &sect; 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and a portion of the medical malpractice claim. The court denied the remainder of the counts. 2018 WL 3388305. The parties held a settlement conference on October 17, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2018, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief. The defendant agreed to replace its current Hepatitis C protocol with a new protocol that incorporated the terms of the settlement agreement. The defendant agreed to provide enhanced medical evaluation and treatment to class members, including direct-acting antivirals to class members when necessary. The settlement agreement also amended the class to include inmates with Hepatitis C who entered the Department of Corrections after the date of class certification. DOC also agreed to provide ongoing reports to plaintiffs' counsel with data regarding testing, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of all class members in prison currently diagnosed with Hepatitis C. The agreement also allowed for a notice-and-comment period prior to any revisions or changes to the Hepatitis C Protocol. Plaintiffs' counsel agreed it would provide the defendant with notice of any potential noncompliance. The parties agreed to enter into good-faith discussion to solve any disputes that may arise from unforeseen circumstances. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement and to resolve any disputes. The DOC agreed to pay the plaintiffs&rsquo; $195,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The court approved the settlement agreement on February 7, 2019. The court retained jurisdiction over the case until June 30, 2022. On October 18, 2022, pursuant to the parties' joint stipulation for dismissal, the court terminated the settlement agreement and dismissed the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, \nDaniel Leyva, and David Maldonado are all incarcerated in DOC facilities and all suffer from \nHepatitis C.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2.)  Defendant John Wetzel is the Secretary of the DOC, Defendant \nPaul Noel is the Chief Medical Director of the DOC, and Defendant Rich Wenhold is the \nInfection Control Coordinator at the DOC; both Noel and Wenhold serve on the DOC’s Hepatitis \nC Treatment Committee.  (Id. ¶¶ 9-11.)  Defendant Correct Care Solutions began providing \nhealth care services for DOC facilities on September 1, 2014, and is the current health care \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 2 of 30\nprovider for all DOC facilities.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  Defendant Jay Cowan is the statewide Medical \nDirector for Correct Care Solutions and serves on the DOC’s Hepatitis C Treatment Committee.  \n(Id. ¶ 13.)  Defendant Dr. John Kephart was the Medical Director at SCI Smithfield during \nrelevant time periods.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Defendant Dr. James Frommer is the current Medical Director \nat SCI Smithfield.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Defendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc. was the health care \nprovider for all DOC facilities prior to Correct Care Solutions.  (Id. ¶ 16.) \nA.  Hepatitis C and Its Treatments \n \n  Hepatitis C is a viral infection that is primarily spread through contact with infected \nblood.  (Id. ¶ 17.)  Hepatitis C attacks the liver and causes hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), \n“which  can  significantly  impair  the  liver’s  ability  to  assist  the  body  in  digesting  essential \nnutrients, filter toxins from the blood, and prevent disease.”  (Id.)  Hepatitis C can be acute or \nchronic. (Id. ¶ 18.)  Acute Hepatitis C is a short-term illness that occurs within the first six \nmonths of exposure to the virus and can lead to Chronic Hepatitis C.  (Id.)  Chronic Hepatitis C \nis a “long-term illness[] that can last throughout a person’s life” and is “the leading cause of \ncirrhosis (irreversible scarring of liver tissue) and liver cancer and is the most common cause of \nliver transplants.”  (Id. ¶ 19.)  Chronic Hepatitis C can also lead to “chronic liver disease, liver \nfibrosis (scarring of liver tissue),” liver  cancer, liver failure, diabetes, heart failure, kidney \ndisease, and death.  (Id. ¶¶ 19, 31.)   There are more than 5400 DOC inmates in the proposed \nclass who have suffered and will continue to “suffer grave and irreparable harm unless the Court \norders Defendants to provide [them with] safe and effective treatment with direct-acting antiviral \ndrugs.”  (Id. ¶ 22.)   \n  In the past, the standard treatment for Hepatitis C infections, “which included the use of \ninterferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure large numbers of patients and was associated \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 3 of 30\nwith painful and other adverse side-effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune disorders, \nflulike symptoms, and gastrointestinal distress.”  (Id. ¶ 23.)  Over the past three years, the \nFederal  Drug  Administration  (“FDA”)  has  approved  new  direct-acting  antiviral  drugs \n(“DAADs”), including Sovaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, to treat Hepatitis C infections.  (Id. ¶ 24.) \nSovaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, when properly administered, “have no adverse side-effects and are \nhighly effective in creating a sustained viral response and a full cure of Hepatitis C infection[s].”  \n(Id. ¶ 25.)  Treatment with DAADs for 8-12 weeks cures more than 90% of patients and has \nbecome the standard of care in the community for Hepatitis C.  (Id. ¶¶ 26-27.)  The following \nentities have recommended DAADs for the treatment of all persons with Chronic Hepatitis C:  \nthe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), the Infectious Diseases \nSociety  of  America  (“IDSA”),  the  Center  for  Disease  Control,  Medicare,  the  Veterans \nAdministration, and most private insurers.  No other treatments are currently recommended for \nthe treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C.  (Id.) \n  From the time the FDA approved DAADs for the treatment of Hepatitis C in 2013 until \nNovember 2016, Defendants failed to develop treatment policies for the use of DAADs and also \nfailed to provide treatment using DAADs to “the vast majority of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis \nC.”  (Id. ¶ 28.)  In November 2016, the DOC issued a Hepatitis C Protocol that established the \nDOC’s final policy and practices for the treatment of inmates with Hepatitis C and created a \nrationing system for the treatment of inmates using DAADs.1  (Id. ¶ 29.)  However, the Protocol \n“arbitrarily denies necessary, appropriate, and constitutionally mandated DAAD treatment to \n                                                 \n  1 Plaintiffs attached a  copy of the Hepatitis C Protocol as Exhibit A to their Joint \nOpposition to Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.  We may consider this document in the context \nof the Motions to Dismiss because it is undisputedly authentic and Plaintiffs’ claims rely on this \ndocument.  See Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Pension Benefit \nGuar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 4 of 30\nover  98%  of  inmates  with  Chronic  Hepatitis  C,  in  direct  conflict  with  community  health \nstandards.”  (Id. ¶ 30.)  Plaintiffs and members of the class have thus been denied treatment with \ndrugs that would cure their Chronic Hepatitis C.  (Id.)   \n  “Chronic Hepatitis C is diagnosed on a fibrosis level scale of F-0 to F-4, with levels F-0 \nand F-1 including persons with early stage chronic Hepatitis C, of whom over 70%, if not treated \nwith DAAD[s], will progress to serious fibrosis and, of that group, 30% will develop cirrhosis of \nthe liver.”  (Id. ¶ 31.)  Defendants’ system of rationing of DAADs means that Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class they seek to represent will “endure chronic inflammatory disease, pain, \nfatigue, increased risks of cancer, liver failure, heart attacks, and death, before any DAAD \ntreatment is provided.”  (Id. ¶ 32.)  There is no medical justification for the failure to treat all \ninmates with Chronic Hepatitis C with DAADs, except for those inmates who have very short \nlife expectancies or release dates less than three months from the start of treatment.  (Id. ¶ 33.)   \nB.  The Plaintiffs \n \n  Chimenti has been incarcerated by the DOC since 1983 and is currently held at the State \nCorrectional  Institute  (“SCI”)  at  Smithfield  (“SCI  Smithfield”).    (Id.  ¶¶  5,  35.)    He  was \ndiagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1991.  (Id. ¶ 36.)  He has received different treatments from the \nDOC since that time, but has not been cured and currently suffers from “Stage 4 compensated \ncirrhosis with chronic liver failure.”  (Id. ¶¶ 37-43.)  In 2009, the Chief Liver Transplant \nSpecialist from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center recommended that Chimenti be \nevaluated for a liver transplant if his Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (“MELD”) score rose \nabove 10.  (Id.   44.)  His MELD score is currently 12.2  (Id. ¶ 43.)   \n¶\n                                                 \n  2 “The MELD score is a measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease \nand is used as a disease severity index to prioritize allocations of organs for transplant.”  (Am. \nCompl.   43)   \n4 \n¶\n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 5 of 30\n  In late 2013, Chimenti began requesting treatment with DAADs, but Defendants denied \nthat treatment for approximately three years.  (Id. ¶¶ 47-48, 54.)  In late 2014 and early 2015, \nemails were exchanged between Dr. Noel, Dr. Dean Rieger (Deputy Chief Clinical Officer of \nCorrect Care Solutions), and Dr. Kephart, discussing Chimenti’s medical treatment.  (Id. ¶ 49.)  \nThey decided that Chimenti should only be monitored and that there was no urgent need to treat \nhim with DAADs.  (Id.)  “In the fall of 2015, a mass was discovered in Chimenti’s liver.”  (Id. ¶ \n51.)  Defendants, particularly Dr. Frommer, “insisted that Chimenti undergo a liver biopsy \nbefore providing any further treatment or referring Mr. Chimenti to a hepatologist . . . even \nthough a biopsy is . . . [not] part of the standard of care due to the risk of bleeding and seeding.”  \n(Id.)  Chimenti ultimately consented to undergo the biopsy, although two different radiologists \nsubsequently determined that a liver biopsy would be too dangerous due to the location of the \nmass.  (Id.)  In March 2016, Chimenti had a meeting with medical staff, including Dr. Frommer, \nregarding his Chronic Hepatitis C and related medical conditions.  (Id. ¶ 52.)  The medical staff \nagreed  to  recommend  that  Chimenti  be  treated  with  DAADs  and  referred  to  a  transplant \nhepatologist.  (Id.)  However, this recommendation was denied by the DOC.  (Id.)  While \nDefendants delayed and denied his requests for treatment with DAADs, Chimenti suffered from \nthe symptoms of Chronic Hepatitis C, including “cirrhosis, and  a failing liver, . . . hypertension, \njaundice, confusion, bad odor, and poor laboratory test results.”  (Id. ¶ 53.)  Even though \nChimenti had stage 4 cirrhosis (the most advanced stage), he was not referred to a hepatologist \nfor an evaluation until July 2016 and was not treated with DAADs until October 2016.  (Id. ¶ \n54.)  As a result of Defendants’ denial and delay of necessary medical treatment, Chimenti \ncontinued to suffer from Chronic Hepatitis C, advanced cirrhosis, the risks of liver failure and \ndeath, and physical and emotional pain and suffering.  (Id. ¶ 56.)  Additionally, he suffered from \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 6 of 30\nfurther deterioration of the condition of his liver during the time he was waiting to be treated \nwith DAADs, to the point that a mass developed in his liver, and he may still need a liver \ntransplant.  Chimenti was finally treated with DAADs in October 2016.  (Id. ¶ 57.)   \n  Leyva was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2001 or 2002, while he was incarcerated at SCI \nAlbion.  (Id. ¶ 60.)  He is presently incarcerated at SCI Retreat.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  He has been treated \nwith interferon and ribavirin, but those drugs did not cure his infection.  (Id. ¶ 61.)  He has asked \nto be treated with DAADs, but was informed by his doctor that the treatment is too costly.  (Id. \n¶¶ 63, 65-66.)  Leyva experiences pain, fatigue, and jaundice because of his Hepatitis C and \nrequires treatment to prevent further liver damage.  (Id. ¶ 67.)  He has not yet received treatment \nwith DAADs.  (Id. ¶ 68.) \n  Maldonado  has  been  incarcerated  by  the  DOC  since  1980  and  was  diagnosed  with \nHepatitis C in 1997.  (Id. ¶¶ 69-70.)  He is presently incarcerated at SCI Graterford).  (Id. ¶ 7.)  \nHe was unsuccessfully treated for his Hepatitis C in 2001 and 2013.  (Id. ¶¶ 71-72.)    He has \nrequested treatment with DAADs, but his request was denied on the ground that the DOC was \ndeveloping a new protocol for treatment of Hepatitis C.  (Id. ¶¶ 73-75.)  As a result of his \nChronic Hepatitis C, Maldonado suffers from elevated liver enzyme levels and also suffers from \nfibrosis that requires immediate treatment.  (Id. ¶¶ 76-77.)   \nC.  The Putative Class \n \n  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \n \nAll  persons  who  are  currently  incarcerated  in  a  Pennsylvania  Department  of \nCorrections facility with a diagnosed condition of Chronic Hepatitis C, and who \nhave at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their sentences, and \nwho have a life expectancy of over one year.   \n \n (Id. ¶ 81.)  The class includes 5400 inmates in the DOC who are geographically dispersed \nthroughout Pennsylvania.  (Id. ¶ 84.)  Plaintiffs believe that the following issues are common to \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 7 of 30\nthe entire Class:  (a) whether treatment with DAADs is the appropriate course of treatment; (b) \nwhether denial of DAADs will injure class members; and (c) whether Defendants’ Hepatitis C \ntreatment policy violates the Eighth Amendment and Article I, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania \nConstitution.  (Id. ¶ 85.) \n  Plaintiffs assert four claims for relief.  Count I asserts a claim for violation of Plaintiffs’ \nEighth Amendment right to receive medical care; Count II asserts a claim for violation of Article \nI, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution; Count III asserts a claim for medical malpractice \non behalf of Chimenti; and Count IV asserts a claim against Correct Care Solutions and Wexford \nfor medical malpractice on behalf of Chimenti.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction ordering the DOC \nto:  \n(a)  formulate  and  implement  a  Hepatitis  C  treatment  policy  that  meets  the \ncommunity standards of care for patients with Hepatitis C, (b) that members of \nthe Class be treated with medically necessary and the appropriate direct-acting \nantiviral  drugs  based  on  individual  medical  testing  and  medical  evaluation \nregarding each individual’s Hepatitis C status, and (c) that members of the class \nreceive ongoing monitoring and medical care per the standard of care for their \nindividual  level  of  liver  fibrosis  and  cirrhosis,  including  but  not  limited  to \nappropriate access to and evaluation by a hepatologist and assessment regarding \ntheir need for partial or full liver transplant. \n \n(Id. ¶ 98.)  Plaintiffs also seek compensatory and punitive damages for Chimenti, reasonable \nattorney’s fees and costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  (Id. ¶¶ 99-\n102.)   \n  The DOC Defendants have moved to dismiss all claims against the DOC and Rich \nWenhold, to dismiss Count I in its entirety, to dismiss Count II to the extent that it requests an \naward  of  monetary  damages  for  violation  of  Article  I,  Section  13  of  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution, and to dismiss Count III to the extent that it asserts a claim for medical malpractice \nagainst Secretary Wetzel.  The Medical Defendants have moved to dismiss Count I in its entirety \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 8 of 30\nand Count II to the extent that it requests an award of monetary damages for Violation of Article \nI, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.  The Medical Defendants have not moved to \ndismiss Counts III and IV.  We held a Hearing on the Motion to Dismiss on April 4, 2017.  \nDuring  that  Hearing,  Plaintiffs  agreed  to  dismiss  all  of  their  claims  against  the  DOC  and \nDefendant Rich Wenhold, and those claims are, accordingly, dismissed.  Plaintiffs also agreed to \ndismiss Count II to the extent that it seeks an award of monetary damages and agreed to limit this \nclaim to a request for injunctive relief against Secretary Wetzel.  We therefore dismiss Count II \nexcept to the extent that it seeks injunctive relief against Secretary Wetzel.  Plaintiffs further \nagreed to dismiss Count III as against Secretary Wetzel and we therefore dismiss Count III as \nagainst Secretary Wetzel.  During the April 4, 2017 Hearing, Plaintiffs also agreed to dismiss \ntheir claim for injunctive relief in Count I against Wexford and Dr. Kephart and agreed to \ndismiss their claim for injunctive relief against Dr. Frommer after he leaves his position as the \nMedical Director of SCI Smithfield.  Consequently, we also dismiss Plaintiffs’ request for \ninjunctive relief in Count I against Wexford, Dr. Kephart, and Dr. Frommer (as of the date that \nhe leaves his position at SCI Smithfield).  We therefore analyze the Motions to Dismiss only as \nto the remaining claims asserted in Count I of the Amended Complaint.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD  \n \nBoth  the  DOC  Defendants  and  the  Medical  Defendants  have  moved  to  dismiss  the \nAmended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  When considering a \nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we “consider only the complaint, exhibits attached \nto the complaint, [and] matters of public record, as well as undisputedly authentic documents if \nthe complainant’s claims are based upon these documents.”  Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, \n230 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 9 of 30\n1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)).  We take the factual allegations of the complaint as true and \n“construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Carpenters Health v. \nManagement Resource Systems, Inc., 837 F.3d 378, 382 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Phillips v. Cty. of \nAllegheny,  515  F.3d  224,  233  (3d  Cir.  2008)).    Legal  conclusions,  however,  receive  no \ndeference, as the court is “‘not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \nallegation.’”  Wood v. Moss, 134 S. Ct. 2056, 2065 n.5 (2014) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009)). \nA plaintiff’s pleading obligation is to set forth “‘a short and plain statement of the \nclaim,’” which gives “‘the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon \nwhich it rests.’”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  The complaint \nmust  contain  “‘sufficient  factual  matter  to  show  that  the  claim  is  facially  plausible,’  thus \nenabling  ‘the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  [the] \nmisconduct alleged.’”  Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen, Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009)).  “The plausibility \nstandard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility \nthat a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n556).  “The plausibility determination is ‘a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court \nto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.’”  Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 \nF.3d 780, 786-87 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679).  In the end, we will grant a motion to dismiss \nbrought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) if the factual allegations in the complaint are not sufficient \n“‘to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’”  W. Run Student Hous. Assocs., LLC v. \nHuntington Nat’l Bank, 712 F.3d 165, 169 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 10 of 30\nIII.  DISCUSSION \n \n  Count I of the Amended Complaint asserts a claim against all Defendants pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 for violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Eighth Amendment based on the denial \nof medical care for their Chronic Hepatitis C.  Section 1983 provides, in pertinent part, as \nfollows: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe  subjected,  any  citizen  of  the  United  States  or  other  person  within  the \njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “Section 1983 provides remedies for deprivations of rights established in the \nConstitution or federal laws.  It does not, by its own terms, create substantive rights.”  Kaucher v. \nCnty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted) (citing Baker v. McCollan, \n443 U.S. 137, 145 n.3 (1979)).  Consequently, in order to state a claim for relief pursuant to § \n1983, “a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived him \nor her of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.”  Id. (citing Am. \nMfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49-50 (1999), and Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 \nF.3d 1137, 1141 (3d Cir. 1995)). \n  Count I alleges that the Defendants’ “acts and omissions in failing to provide adequate \nmedical  care  constitute  a  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  medical  needs  of  prisoners \ninfected with Hepatitis C, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 90.)  The Eighth Amendment’s right to be free from \ncruel  and  unusual  punishment,  which  applies  to  the  states  via the  Fourteenth  Amendment, \nRobinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 666 (1962), “imposes duties on [prison] officials, who \nmust . . . ensure that inmates receive . . . medical care, and must ‘take reasonable measures to \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 11 of 30\nguarantee the safety of the inmates.’”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting \nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27 (1984) (remaining citations omitted)).  To state a claim \nunder the Eighth Amendment for denial of medical care, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a \ndefendant showed “[1] deliberate indifference to [2] serious medical needs of [a] prisoner[ ].”  \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (quotation omitted).  Courts have consistently held \nthat “mere allegations of malpractice” are not sufficient to allege “deliberate indifference.”  Id. at \n106 n.14 (citations omitted). \n  “Deliberate indifference can be shown by a prison official ‘intentionally denying or \ndelaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.’” \nRhines v. Bledsoe, 388 F. App’x 225, 227 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05). \n“A medical need is serious if it ‘has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one \nthat  is  so  obvious  that  a  lay  person  would  easily  recognize  the  necessity  for  a  doctor’s \nattention.’”  Id. (quoting Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d \nCir. 1987)).  Moreover, “to be considered ‘serious,’” the medical need must be such that “‘a \nfailure to treat can be expected to lead to substantial and unnecessary suffering, injury, or \ndeath.’”  Tsakonas v. Cicchi, 308 F. App’x 628, 632 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Colburn v. Upper \nDarby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 2023 (3d Cir. 1991)).   \n  A prison official acts with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need “when he \nknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.”  Brown v. Thomas, 172 F. \nApp’x 446, 450 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  “The official must be aware of \nthe facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, \nand he must also draw the inference.”  Id. (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  Given these \nprerequisites to a valid constitutional claim based on deliberate indifference, factual allegations \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 12 of 30\nsuggesting only an “‘ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner’s interests or safety’” will not \nsuffice  to  meet  the  pleading  requirements  for  deliberate  indifference  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835 (quoting Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986)). \nA.  The Individual DOC Defendants \n \n  The individual DOC Defendants argue that Count I fails to state a claim against them \nupon which relief can be granted because the Amended Complaint does not allege facts that \nwould establish that they were deliberately indifferent to the Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs.  \nThey maintain that Count I is based on allegations that they considered cost in deciding which \ninmates with Hepatitis C would be treated with DAADs and that the inmates with Chronic \nHepatitis C would receive treatment with DAADs if they were being treated outside of the prison \nsystem.  They further assert that the consideration of costs in deciding appropriate medical \ntreatment cannot, as a matter of law, constitute deliberate indifference.  They also contend that \nallegations that they deviated from community standards of care amount to mere disagreements \nwith Plaintiffs’ medical treatments that do not rise to the level of deliberate indifference to \nPlaintiffs’ serious medical needs.   The individual DOC Defendants also contend that the claim \nfor monetary damages contained in Count I should be dismissed because they have qualified \nimmunity with respect to such a claim.   \n1.  Costs \n \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that the DOC systematically denies treatment with \nDAADs to inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.)  The Amended Complaint \nfurther alleges that, while “[m]ajor medical associations, Medicare, the Veterans Administration, \nand private health insurance companies provide DAAD[s] to all persons with Chronic Hepatitis \nC,” the DOC “refuses to provide treatment with DAADs to more than 98% of inmates with \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 13 of 30\n[C]hronic Hepatitis C” solely because of the cost of these drugs.  (Id.)  The individual DOC \nDefendants argue that the allegation that they have adopted a policy for treatment of inmates \nwith Chronic Hepatitis C that rations DAADs and restricts treatment with those drugs solely \nbecause of the cost of those drugs3 cannot support a plausible claim that they are deliberately \nindifferent to the Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs because “the mere assertion that defendants \nconsidered cost in treating [plaintiffs’ medical conditions] does not suffice to state a claim for \ndeliberate indifference, as prisoners do not have a constitutional right to limitless medical care.”  \nBrown v. Beard, 445 F. App’x 453, 456 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d \n166, 175 (3d Cir. 1997) (concluding that allegation that prison officials and medical personnel \nrefused plaintiff’s request for hernia surgery due to budgetary concerns was insufficient to state a \ndeliberate indifference claim where documents attached to the complaint showed that medical \npersonnel believed that the hernia was reducible without surgery); see also Winslow v. Prison \nHealth Servs., 406 F. App’x 671, 674 (3d Cir. 2011) (determining that allegation that doctor \ntreated  plaintiff  with  a  hernia  belt  rather  than  surgery  based  on  the  cost  of  surgery  was \ninsufficient  to  state  a  claim  of  deliberate  indifference  because  “the  naked  assertion  that \nDefendants considered cost in treating [plaintiff’s] hernia does not suffice to state a claim for \ndeliberate indifference as prisoners do not have a constitutional right to limitless medical care, \nfree  of  the  cost  constraints  under  which  law-abiding  citizens  receive  treatment”  (citations \nomitted)).   \n                                                 \n  3 The DOC Defendants assert that the DOC has 5400 inmates who are infected with \nHepatitis C, all of whom would like to be treated immediately with DAADs, and that the \ntreatment of only one individual with DAADs would cost approximately $55,000.  (DOC Defs.’ \nMem. at 9.)  However, the cost of treating an inmate with DAADs is not alleged in the Amended \nComplaint and the DOC Defendants have not cited to any alternate source that supports this \nassertion.  Consequently, we cannot consider the DOC Defendants’ assertion that the treatment \nof a single individual with DAADs would cost $55,000.   \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 14 of 30\n  The  Amended  Complaint,  however,  contains  more  than  the  mere  assertion  that \nDefendants considered costs in deciding whether patients with Chronic Hepatitis C infections \nwill receive treatment with DAADs or some other appropriate medical treatment.  The Amended \nComplaint alleges that the DOC has developed a policy regarding the treatment of inmates with \nChronic  Hepatitis  C  infections,  pursuant  to  which  Defendants  refuse  to  provide  medically \nnecessary treatment that is mandated by prevailing community medical standards to 98% of \ninmates with Chronic Hepatitis C infections.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-2, 29-30.)  The Amended \nComplaint further alleges that the DOC has adopted the policy of denying DAADs to more than \n98% of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C infections solely because of costs, and not based on \nany medical justification.  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 33.)  The Amended Complaint also alleges that Chronic \nHepatitis C infections cause cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of liver tissue), liver cancer, serious \nchronic liver disease, liver fibrosis (scarring of liver tissue), and other conditions.  (Id.   19.)  \nMoreover, “[f]or persons with chronic Hepatitis C, each day without treatment increas¶es the \nlikelihood of these conditions” and that by failing to provide medically necessary treatment with \nDAADs, the Defendants have increased the risks that Plaintiffs and other inmates with Chronic \nHepatitis C will suffer irreparable harm stemming from their infections.   (Id. ¶¶ 19, 22.)  \nMedical  treatment  with  DAADs  cures  90-95%  of  patients  treated  and  has  relatively  short \ntreatment periods of 8-12 weeks.  (Id. ¶ 26.)  Furthermore, while the plaintiffs in Brown and \nWinslow could be treated with less expensive medical treatments than the surgery they sought4; \nthe  Amended  Complaint  alleges  that  DAADs  are  the  only  treatments  that  are  presently \nrecommended for Chronic Hepatitis C infections.  (Id.   27.) \n¶\n                                                 \n  4 See Brown, 445 F App’x at 456; Winslow, 406 F. App’x at 674.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 15 of 30\n  We conclude, accordingly, that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the \nDOC’s use of its Hepatitis C Protocol to ration medical treatment with DAADs based solely on \ncost, even though there is no other recommended medical treatment for Chronic Hepatitis C, \ndisregards an excessive risk to the health of the infected inmates and thus constitutes deliberate \nindifference to a serious medical need.  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit  has  explained,  “while  ‘administrative  convenience  and  cost  may  be,  in  appropriate \ncircumstances, permissible factors for correctional systems to consider in making treatment \ndecisions, the Constitution is violated when they are considered to the exclusion of reasonable \nmedical judgment about inmate health.’”  Allah v. Thomas, 679 F App’x 216, 220 (3d Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843, 863 (7th Cir. 2011)) (concluding that complaint alleging \nthat DOC denied plaintiff treatment with DAADs for his Hepatitis C infection based solely on \ncost, causing him to suffer medical complications, “plausibly alleged an Eighth Amendment \nviolation”).  Consequently, we deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count I of the \nAmended Complaint as to this argument. \n2.  Disagreement regarding treatment \n  The individual DOC Defendants also argue that the Amended Complaint does not allege \na plausible claim of deliberate indifference because it merely asserts that Plaintiffs disagree with \nthe type of treatment that the DOC is providing for their Chronic Hepatitis C.  The DOC \nDefendants maintain that, although the Amended Complaint alleges that they have failed to \nadhere to community standards for treatment, they are not obligated to provide inmates with the \nsame community standard of medical care that is provided to non-incarcerated citizens.  They \nfurther  assert  that  the  law  does  not  require  them  to  provide  inmates  with  their  preferred \nmedication.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 16 of 30\nThe individual DOC Defendants rely on Maggert v. Hanks, 131 F.3d 670 (7th Cir. 1997), \nin which the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated that “[a] prison is not \nrequired by the Eighth Amendment to give a prisoner medical care that is as good as he would \nreceive if he were a free person, let alone an affluent free person.  He is entitled only to \nminimum care.”  Id. at 671-72 (citations omitted).  See also Goff v. Bechtold, 632 F. Supp. 697, \n698 (S.D.W. Va. 1986) (stating that the medical care provided to inmates “need not be the best \npossible care; it only has to be ‘reasonable’ care” (citations omitted)); Bruton v. Gillis, Civ. A. \nNo. 04-0083, 2008 WL 4453367, at *12 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2008) (stating that “the Eighth \nAmendment does not require that a prisoner receive every medical treatment that he requests or \nthat is available elsewhere”).  The DOC Defendants further rely on Rozelle v. Rossi, 307 F. \nApp’x 640 (3d Cir. 2008), in which the Third Circuit rejected a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment \ndeliberate indifference claim based on a doctor’s failure to prescribe Accutane for the prisoner’s \nacne for safety reasons, and the alternative treatments prescribed by the doctor were successful.  \nId. at 642-43.  The individual DOC Defendants also rely on many cases from this Circuit and \nothers, in which courts rejected Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims brought by \nprisoners  who  challenged  a  prison’s  failure  to  treat  their  Hepatitis  C  infections  with  the \nprisoner’s preferred drug.  See Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App’x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (affirming \ndismissal of prisoner’s deliberate indifference claim where the prisoner’s treatment with ribavirin \nand  interferon  was  delayed  until  he  had  undergone  medically  recommended  “physical  and \npsychological  examinations,  extensive  laboratory  testing,  and  several  counseling  sessions”); \nHodge v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 372 F. App’x 264, 267-68 (3d Cir. 2010) (affirming \norder granting summary judgment to defendants on prisoner’s Eighth Amendment deliberate \nindifference claim where the doctor did not prescribe all of the medications sought by the \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 17 of 30\nprisoner, who had Hepatitis C, but the prisoner was treated with interferon, monitored, seen at \nthe clinic for complications, and taken to a liver specialist); Neeley v. Carrillo, Civ. A. No. 14-\n0542, 2015 WL 7251544, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 17, 2015) (granting summary judgment in favor \nof defendants on Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim where plaintiff claimed that \nhe had received no treatment for his Hepatitis C, but defendants supplied medical records to \nshow that he had seen doctors, had tests, and received treatment); Watford v. New Jersey State \nPrison, Civ. A. No. 16-7878, 2016 WL 6841079, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 21, 2016) (dismissing \nprisoner’s deliberate indifference claim based on prison’s failure to treat him with DAADs \nbecause the complaint alleged that the prisoner “was provided treatment by both prison doctors \nand a specialist doctor, and that he received extensive testing ‘with the promise’ of eventual \ntreatment with the medication he wishe[d] to receive” and “he was told that the doctors believed \nmore testing was necessary before proceeding with treatment with Harvoni”); Murray v. Pa. \nDep’t of Corrs., Civ. A. No. 15-48, 2016 WL 7744449, at *8, *10 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 16, 2016), \napproved and adopted by 2017 WL 151636 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 13, 2017) (recommending that \ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment be granted where the inmate claimed deliberate \nindifference to his serious medical need for treatment of his Hepatitis C infection because \ndefendants failed to treat him with Harvoni, but did not allege any specific actions taken by any \nindividual defendant and the plaintiff’s medical records showed that he had been “frequently \nseen, examined, and treated for his HCV condition by . . . members of SCI-Albion’s medical \nstaff . . .”). \nHowever, none of the authority on which the individual DOC Defendants rely considered \nthe DOC’s current Hepatitis C protocol, which was adopted by the DOC after most of the cases \non which the individual DOC Defendants rely were decided.  In two cases decided since the \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 18 of 30\nDOC adopted the Hepatitis C Protocol, prisoners who brought claims similar to those raised in \nthe instant case were found to have stated claims for deliberate indifference to their serious \nmedical needs.  In Allah v. Thomas, the plaintiff alleged that he had requested treatment with \nHarvoni for his Hepatitis C infection, but was informed “that he could not be given the treatment \n[be]cause  it  is  expensive.”    Allah,  679  F.  App’x  at  220  (alteration  in  original)  (quotation \nomitted).  The plaintiff “argued that this constituted a deliberate indifference to [his] serious \nmedical needs because he was in danger of developing fibrosis and cirrhosis, his liver [was] \ndeteriorating and [he was] having pain in [his] liver area, and he was starting to get and feel tired \nall the time and [ ] getting yellowing of the skin.”  Id. (alterations in original) (quotations \nomitted).  The Third Circuit concluded that these allegations were sufficient to allege a deliberate \nindifference claim, given that “Allah alleged  that he did not receive  any treatment for his \nHepatitis C condition, that he was not placed on a newly developed Hepatitis C treatment \nregimen solely because it was cost-prohibitive, and that he was suffering medical complications \nas a result.”  Id. (citing Roe, 631 F.3d at 863).   \n  In Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, Civ. A. No. 16-2000, 2017 WL 34700 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2017), \nthe plaintiff claimed that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs \nbecause they refused to treat his chronic Hepatitis C infection with DAADs.  Id. at *14.  He filed \na motion for a preliminary injunction seeking an order requiring the defendants (including \nWetzel and Noel) to treat him with DAADs.  Id. at *1.  The district court had previously held \nthree days of evidentiary hearings in connection with an earlier motion, in which it heard \nevidence regarding the treatment of Hepatitis C with DAADs, the standard of care for Hepatitis \nC, and the DOC’s Hepatitis C Protocol.  Id. at *1-4.  The district court reached the following \nconclusions of law regarding the DOC’s Hepatitis C Protocol:  \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 19 of 30\n5.  The Hepatitis C Protocol, in both how it is written and how it is implemented, \nbars those without vast fibrosis or cirrhosis from being approved for treatment \nwith  [DAAD]  medications.    As  such,  the  Hepatitis  C  Protocol  presents  a \nconscious disregard of a known risk that inmates with fibrosis, like Plaintiff, will \nsuffer from hepatitis C related complications, continued liver scarring and damage \nprogressing  into  cirrhosis,  and  from  cirrhosis  related  complications  such  as \nascites, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and esophageal varices. \n \n6.  The Hepatitis C Protocol deliberately delays treatment for hepatitis C through \nthe administration of [DAAD] drugs such as Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Viekira Pak \ndespite  the  knowledge  of  Defendants  that  sit  on  the  Hepatitis  C  Treatment \nCommittee: (1) that the aforesaid [DAAD] medications will effect a  cure  of \nHepatitis C in 90 to 95 percent of the cases of that disease; and (2) that the \nsubstantial delay in treatment that is inherent in the current protocol is likely to \nreduce the efficacy of these medications and thereby prolong the suffering of \nthose  who  have  been  diagnosed  with  chronic  hepatitis  C  and  allow  the \nprogression of the disease to accelerate so that it presents a greater threat of \ncirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death of the inmate with such disease. \n \n7. Plaintiff was denied the treatment with DAA medications pursuant to DOC \npolicy, not because of any medical exclusions. \n \n8.  The  named  Defendants  who  sit  on  the  Hepatitis  C  Treatment  Committee \ndeliberately denied administering DAA drugs to Plaintiff despite knowing that \nadministering  such  drugs  was  the  standard  of  care.  In  choosing  a  course  of \nmonitoring  over  treatment,  they  consciously  disregarded  the  known  risks  of \nPlaintiff's  serious  medical  needs,  namely  continued liver  scarring,  disease \nprogression, and other hepatitis C complications. \n \nId. at *11.  The district court concluded that the plaintiff had “established a reasonable likelihood \nof success of showing that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical need” \nand granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  Id. at *20. \n  Like the complaints filed in Allah and Abu-Jamal, the Amended Complaint in this action \nspecifically alleges that Plaintiffs have Chronic Hepatitis C infections, that they all currently \nsuffer from, or are at risk of suffering from, serious medical conditions as a result of these \ninfections, and that the DOC has delayed or denied their requests for treatment with DAADs.  \n(See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 43, 47, 53-54, 56-57, 60, 64-66, 67, 70, 73-79.)  The Amended Complaint \nalso alleges that the DOC Defendants who participated in the DOC’s Hepatitis C Treatment \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 20 of 30\nCommittee developed the DOC’s Hepatitis C Protocol, which was issued in November 2016.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 10-11, 29.)   The Hepatitis C Protocol rations treatment with DAADs to prisoners with \nChronic Hepatitis C based on the prisoner’s fibrosis level.  (Id. ¶¶ 29-31.)  The Hepatitis C \nProtocol prioritizes treatment with DAADs to inmates who already have cirrhosis or liver cancer, \nare candidates for liver transplants, or have other grave diseases.  (Hepatitis C Protocol at 20-7.)  \nThe next highest priority for treatment is patients who have advanced fibrosis, Hepatitis B or \nHIV coinfections, other liver diseases and chronic kidney disease.  (Id. at 20-89.)  Patients with \nstage 2 fibrosis are prioritized next, and the lowest priority for treatment is patients with stage 0 \nor 1 fibrosis.  (Id.)  However, the Amended Complaint alleges that even individuals with stage 0 \nto 1 fibrosis should be treated with DAADs because, of this group, “over 70%, if not treated with \nDAAD[s], will progress to serious fibrosis and, of that group, 30% will develop cirrhosis of the \nliver.”  (Am. Compl.   31.)  Moreover, “[a]ll persons with Chronic Hepatitis C risk liver cancer, \nliver failure, diabetes¶, heart failure, kidney disease, and serious physical and mental pain and \nsuffering.”  (Id.)   \n  We conclude that the Amended Complaint alleges that the DOC Defendants developed a \nHepatitis  C  Protocol  that  denies  or  delays  treatment  with  DAADs  to  the  vast  majority  of \nprisoners with Chronic Hepatitis C infections, even though treatment with DAADs is the current \nstandard of care for individuals with Chronic Hepatitis C infections such as the Plaintiffs.   The \nAmended Complaint further alleges that Plaintiffs have experienced a worsening of their serious \nmedical conditions as a result of the denial or delay of their requests for treatment with DAADs.  \nMoreover, the Amended Complaint also alleges that the individual DOC Defendants have denied \nor delayed treatment of Plaintiffs with DAADs solely because of the cost of those drugs, and not \nfor any medical reasons.  We further conclude, accordingly, that the Amended Complaint alleges \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 21 of 30\nmore than a disagreement about Plaintiffs’ medical treatment, or dissatisfaction with the DOC \nDefendants’ denial of Plaintiffs’ requests for treatment in favor of a different treatment with a \npossibility of success.  Rather, the Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have serious \nmedical  needs  for  treatment  for  their  Chronic  Hepatitis  C  and  that  the  DOC  Defendants \nintentionally  denied  and/or  delayed  Plaintiffs’  access  to  any  medical  care  for  their  serious \nmedical  needs  beginning  in  2013.    We  further  conclude,  accordingly,  that  the  Amended \nComplaint alleges facts that are sufficient to state a plausible claim for violation of Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the Eighth Amendment pursuant to §1983 due to the DOC Defendants’ deliberate \nindifference  to  their  serious  medical  needs.    See  Rhines,  388  F.  App’x  at  227  (quotation \nomitted); Allah, 679 F. App’x at 220; Abu-Jamal, 2017 WL 34700, at *11, 20.  Accordingly, we \ndeny the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint as to this \nargument.  \n3.  Qualified immunity \n \n  The individual DOC Defendants also argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity \nwith respect to Chimenti’s claim for damages in Count I.  “‘Qualified immunity shields federal \nand state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the \nofficial violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was “clearly established” \nat the time of the challenged conduct.’”  Mirabella v. Villard, 853 F.3d 641, 648 (3d Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011)).  As the Supreme Court explained in \nCity and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, -- U.S. --, 135 S. Ct. 1765 (2015), a public official \n“‘cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right’s contours were \nsufficiently definite that any reasonable official in [his] shoes would have understood that he was \nviolating it,’ meaning that ‘existing precedent . . . placed the statutory or constitutional question \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 22 of 30\nbeyond debate.’”  Id. at 1774 (alterations in original) (quoting Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. \n2012, 2023 (2014); and al–Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741).  “This exacting standard ‘gives government \nofficials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments’ by ‘protect[ing] all but the \nplainly incompetent or  those who knowingly violate the law.’”   Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting  al-Kidd,  563  U.S.  at  743).    Consequently,  our  analysis  of  the  DOC  Defendants’ \nqualified immunity argument requires a two-step analysis:  (1) we decide whether the facts \nalleged in the Amended Complaint “‘make out a violation of a constitutional right’” and (2) we \ndecide whether that right “‘was clearly established at the time of [the] defendant’s alleged \nmisconduct.’”  Montanez v. Thompson, 603 F.3d 243, 250 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Pearson v. \nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009)).  These two steps do not have to be considered in this order.  \nId. (quoting Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236).   \n  The individual DOC Defendants argue that, based on the allegations of the Amended \nComplaint, they could not have known that they were violating clearly established law.  They \nrely on Maskelunas v. Wexford Health Source, Inc., Civ. A. No. 14-369, 2015 WL 6686709 \n(W.D. Pa. Oct. 8, 2015), approved and adopted by 2015 WL 6686719 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 29, 2015), \nwhere the district court granted Dr. Paul Noel’s motion for summary judgement with respect to \nthe plaintiff’s § 1983 claim for damages arising from the DOC’s failure to treat his Hepatitis C \ninfection.  See id., 2015 WL 6686719, at *1; approving and adopting 2015 WL 6686709, at *1.  \nThe magistrate judge recommended that Noel was protected by qualified immunity because \nNoel’s decision to put a hold on the plaintiff’s treatment for his Hepatitis C infection was the \n“result of a statewide directive from the [DOC],” which directive arose from “the rapid change in \ntreatment methods for hepatitis C, including the introduction of Sovaldi as a treatment.”  Id., \n2015 WL 6686709, at *3.  The magistrate judge explained that “when the treatment protocols for \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 23 of 30\na serious medical condition . . . are in flux, it is impossible for a medical care provider to know \nwhat the ‘contours,’ to use the term from Sheehan, of an inmate’s rights are.”  Id. \n  As we discussed above, the Amended Complaint alleges that the FDA approved the use \nof  DAADs  to  treat  Chronic  Hepatitis  C  infections  in  2013  and  that  the  individual  DOC \nDefendants denied Chimenti’s requests to be treated with DAADs from late 2013 until October \n2016.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28, 47-49, 52-54.)  While the individual DOC Defendants were denying \nChimenti’s requests for treatment with DAADs, his medical condition worsened, until, in the fall \nof 2015, a mass was discovered in his liver.  (Id. ¶ 51.)  The individual Defendants then required \nChimenti to undergo a medically unnecessary and dangerous liver biopsy before they would \nconsider providing him with any further treatment for his Chronic Hepatitis C infection or \nreferring  him  to  a  hepatologist.    (Id.)    Even  after  the  DOC’s  medical  staff,  including  Dr. \nFrommer, agreed in March 2016 that Chimenti should receive treatment with DAADs and be \nreferred  to  a  transplant  hepatologist,  the  DOC  refused  to  provide  Chimenti  with  this \nrecommended medical treatment. (Id. ¶ 52.)  The Amended Complaint further alleges that, while \nthe individual DOC Defendants delayed and denied Chimenti treatment with DAADs, Chimenti \nsuffered from the symptoms of Chronic Hepatitis C, which include cirrhosis, a failing liver, \nhypertension, jaundice, and confusion.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  The DOC did not allow Chimenti, who has \nstage 4 cirrhosis (the most advanced stage), to be referred to a hepatologist for an evaluation \nuntil July 2016 and did not provide him with DAAD treatment until October 2016, causing \nChimenti to continue to suffer from the symptoms Chronic Hepatitis C infection.  (Id. ¶¶ 53-54, \n56-57.)   \n  We concluded above that the Amended Complaint alleges a violation of the Plaintiffs’ \nEighth  Amendment  rights.    Consequently,  we  need  only  determine  whether  the  Amended \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 24 of 30\nComplaint  sufficiently  alleges  that  this  right  “was  clearly  established  at  the  time  of  [the] \ndefendant[s’] alleged misconduct.”  Montanez, 603 F.3d at 250.  While the Amended Complaint \ndoes not allege the date on which use of DAADs to treat Chronic Hepatitis C became the \nstandard of care in the community for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C infections, it does \nallege that the FDA approved the use of these drugs for treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in \n2013, that the DOC refused to allow Chimenti to be treated with these drugs after doctors \nemployed by the DOC recommended that he receive that treatment, and that the DOC required \nthat  Chimenti  undergo  a  dangerous  and  unnecessary  medical  procedure  prior  to  receiving \ntreatment with DAADs.  We conclude that the allegations of the Amended Complaint do not \ndescribe a situation in which the “treatment protocols” for Chronic Hepatitis C were “in flux” for \nthe entire period in which the DOC denied Chimenti’s request for treatment with DAADs and \nrequired him to undergo an unnecessary and dangerous medical procedure.  See Maskelunas, \n2015 WL 6686709, at *3.  We further conclude, accordingly, that the Amended Complaint does \nnot allege a situation in which it was impossible for the DOC Defendants to know the “contours” \nof Chimenti’s Eighth Amendment rights.  See id.; Sheehan, 135 S. Ct. at 1774 (quotation \nomitted).    Consequently,  we  will  not  dismiss  Chimenti’s  claim  for  damages  against  the \nindividual DOC Defendants pursuant to § 1983 at this stage of the litigation based on qualified \nimmunity, and we deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to this argument. \nB.  The Medical Defendants \n \n1.  Correct Care Solutions and Wexford \n \n  The Medical Defendants move to dismiss Count I as against Correct Care Solutions and \nWexford because the Amended Complaint does not allege that either of these Defendants was \ninvolved in developing the DOC’s Hepatitis C Policy.  It is well settled that a municipal entity \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 25 of 30\ncannot be sued under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of its employees.  See Monell v. Dep’t of \nSoc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  This rule has been extended to private corporations \noperating under a contract with the state.  See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d \n575, 583-84 (3d Cir. 2003).  Indeed, the Third Circuit has made it clear that a private company \nthat provides medical services to inmates at state facilities “‘cannot be held responsible for the \nacts of its employees under a theory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.’”  Sims v. \nWexford Health Sources, 635 F. App’x 16, 20 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Natale, 318 F.3d at 583).  \nTherefore, in order to state a § 1983 claim against Correct Care Solutions and Wexford, the \nAmended Complaint must allege “facts to state a claim that [these Defendants] had a policy, \ncustom, or practice, and that the policy, custom, or practice caused the constitutional violation at \nissue.”  Id. (citing Natale, 318 F.3d at 583-84).  See also Stankowski v. Farley, 251 F. App’x \n743, 748 (3d Cir. 2007) (stating that a private corporation providing medical care inside a prison \nmay not be held liable for the “constitutional violations committed by its employees, unless [it] \nhas adopted a policy, practice or custom that caused the constitutional violations alleged.” (citing \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690; and Woodward v. Corr. Med. Servs., 368 F.3d 917, 927 (7th Cir. \n2004));  Ozoroski  v.  Maue,  460  F.  App’x  94,  97-98  (3d  Cir.  2011)  (“To  establish  Eighth \nAmendment liability against a private employer . . . the prisoner must ‘provide evidence that \nthere was a relevant [corporate] policy or custom . . . that . . . caused the constitutional violation \n[he] allege[s].’” (second through sixth alterations in original) (quoting  Natale 318 F.3d at 584)).  \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that Correct Care Solutions “is the current health care \nprovider for all DOC facilities” and that Wexford “was the previous health care provider for all \nDOC facilities.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.)  The Amended Complaint does not allege that either \nCorrect Care Solutions or Wexford established a corporate policy, or had a corporate practice or \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 26 of 30\ncustom with respect to the use of DAADs to treat inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C.  Nor does it \nallege that any policy, custom, or practice of Correct Care Solutions or Wexford caused the \nviolations  of  Plaintiffs’  Eighth  Amendment  rights.    We  thus  conclude  that  the  Amended \nComplaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible § 1983 claim against either Correct \nCare Solutions or Wexford for deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.  See Sims, 635 F. App’x at 20 (citing Natale, 318 F.3d at \n583-84); Ozoroski, 460 F. App’x at 97-98 (quotation omitted)).  We thus grant the Medical \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint as against Correct Care \nSolutions and Wexford. \n2.  The individual medical defendants \n \n  The Medical Defendants argue that Count I should be dismissed as to Dr. Cowan because \nthe Amended Complaint does not allege that he had any personal involvement in creating or \nimplementing the Hepatitis C Protocol.  “‘A[n individual government] defendant in a civil rights \naction must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongdoing; liability cannot be predicated \nsolely on the operation of respondeat superior.  Personal involvement can be shown through \nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.’”  Evancho v. Fisher, \n423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d \n1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)); see also Argueta v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 643 F.3d 60, \n72 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Rode, 845 F.2d at 1207; and citing Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 \nF.3d 121, 129 (3d Cir. 2010)).  Thus, a conclusory allegation that defendants were “directly \ninvolved”  in  the  violations  of  the  plaintiff’s  rights  is  not  sufficient  to  allege  personal \ninvolvement.  Bush v. Dep’t of Human Svcs., 614 F. App’x 616, 620 (3d Cir. 2015).  See also \nWright v. Warden, Forest SCI, 582 F. App’x 136, 137 (3d Cir. 2014) (dismissing § 1983 claim \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 27 of 30\nagainst prison officials where the allegations that those officials “had a ‘statutory duty to enforce \npolicies’  and  govern  the  ‘conduct  of  their  subordinates’  .  .  .  fail[ed]  to  suggest  that  the \nDefendants were personally involved in creating or maintaining the dangerous condition” that \nled to plaintiff’s injuries (citation omittied)); Gorrell v. Yost, 509 F. App’x 114, 118 (3d Cir. \n2013)  (determining  that  allegation  that  mailroom  officers  were  “responsible  for  the  daily \noperations of the mail room” was “insufficient to establish personal liability” with respect to \nplaintiff’s claim that prison mailroom staff “interfered with his legal mail by either deliberately \nwithholding it or opening it and failing to forward it to him”).   \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that Dr. Cowan, the statewide Medical Director for \nCorrect Care Solutions, serves on the DOC Hepatitis C Treatment Committee.  (Am. Compl.   \n13.)  The Amended Complaint further alleges that the Hepatitis C Treatment Committee make¶s \nthe  final  medical  determinations  for  inmates  with  Hepatitis  C.    (Id.    10.)  However,  the \nAmended Complaint does not allege that Dr. Cowan was personally involv¶ed in the development \nof the Hepatitis C Protocol or decision making with respect to the medical treatment of any of \nthe three Plaintiffs.  We conclude, accordingly, that the Amended Complaint does not allege \nsufficient facts to state a plausible § 1983 claim against Dr. Cowan for deliberate indifference to \nPlaintiffs’ serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  We thus grant the \nMedical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint as against Dr. \nCowan. \n  The Medical Defendants also argue that Count I should be dismissed as against Dr. \nFrommer and Dr. Kephart because the allegations of the Amended Complaint assert only that \nChimenti is dissatisfied with the medical treatment he received, which is insufficient to support a \nclaim for a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The Medical Defendants argue that, because \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 28 of 30\nChimenti received medical care for his Chronic Hepatitis C infection, his claims amount only to \na disagreement about his care, and the Amended Complaint thus cannot allege a plausible Eighth \nAmendment deliberate indifference claim.   \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that Chimenti began to request treatment with DAADs \nin late 2013 and that those requests were denied, even though the standard of care at that time \nwas treatment with Sovaldi and ribavirin.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 47.)  In November 2014, Chimenti \nwas notified that the DOC had not approved the use of Harvoni.  (Id. ¶ 48.)  In late 2014 and \nearly 2015, “emails were exchanged between Dr. Noel, Dr. Dean Rieger . . . , and Dr. Kephart . . \n. discussing Mr. Chimenti’s medical treatment, and deciding that Mr. Chimenti should merely be \nmonitored and that there was no urgency in providing the latest DAAD medication treatment.”  \n(Id. ¶ 49.)  Dr. Kephart (as the former Medical Director of SCI Smithfield) and Dr. Frommer (as \nthe current Medical Director of SCI Smithfield) received, reviewed, and approved all requests \nfor referrals to outside providers and outside medical treatment for Chimenti, and received and \nreviewed reports from the outside medical providers that related to Chimenti’s Chronic Hepatitis \nC infection and related conditions.  (Id. ¶ 50.)  In the fall of 2015, a mass was discovered in \nChimenti’s liver and Dr. Frommer insisted that Chimenti undergo a liver biopsy before providing \nany further treatment or referring Chimenti to a hepatologist, even though a biopsy is not \nrecommended as part of the standard of care.  (Id. ¶ 51.)  In March 2016, Chimenti met with \nmedical staff, including Dr. Frommer, regarding his Hepatitis C and related medical conditions, \nand  the  medical  personnel  agreed  to  treatment  with  DAADs  and  referral  to  a  transplant \nhepatologist.  (Id. ¶ 52.)  This recommendation was denied by DOC’s Central Office.  (Id.)  \nDuring the period from late 2013, until March 2016, during which Dr. Frommer and Dr. Kephart \nmonitored Chimenti’s condition but refused to recommend him for medical treatment for his \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 29 of 30\nChronic Hepatitis C, Chimenti developed a mass in his liver and suffered from other symptoms \nof Chronic Hepatitis C.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  We conclude that the Amended Complaint alleges more than \nmere disagreement and dissatisfaction with Chimenti’s medical care; it alleges that Chimenti \nsuffers from a serious medical condition, that Dr. Kephart and Dr. Frommer deliberately delayed \ntreatment for that medical condition, and that Chimenti’s condition worsened during the period \nof delay.  The Amended Complaint further alleges that Dr. Frommer required Chimenti to \nundergo a dangerous and unnecessary medical procedure.  We further conclude, accordingly, \nthat  Count  I  of  the  Amended  Complaint  states  a  plausible  §  1983  claim  for  violation  of \nChimenti’s Eighth Amendment rights against Dr. Kephart and Dr. Frommer.  See Estelle, 429 \nU.S. at 104; Rhines, 388 F. App’x at 227 (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  For the reasons stated above, the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss all claims raised \nin the Amended Complaint against the DOC and Rich Wenhold is granted by agreement of the \nparties  and  those  Defendants  are  dismissed  as  defendants  in  this  proceeding.    The  DOC \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss is denied as to Count I as against the other DOC Defendants.  \nThe Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count I is granted as to the claims asserted \nagainst Correct Care Solutions, Wexford, and Dr. Cowan.  By agreement of the parties, the \nMedical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count I is also granted as to the claims for \ninjunctive relief against Dr. Kephart and Dr. Frommer (as of the time Dr. Frommer leaves his \nposition as Medical Director of SCI Smithfield).  The Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as \nto Count I is denied as to the claims for monetary damages asserted in Count I against Dr. \nKephart and Dr. Frommer.  Count II is dismissed by agreement of the parties to the extent that it \nseeks an award of monetary damages and is also dismissed to the extent that it seeks injunctive \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/08/17   Page 30 of 30\nrelief as against all Defendants except for Secretary Wetzel.  Count III is dismissed as against \nSecretary Wetzel by agreement of the parties.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs may pursue the § 1983 \nclaim raised in Count I for both injunctive relief and damages against  Secretary Wetzel and Dr. \nNoel, and for monetary damages only against Dr. Kephart and Dr. Frommer.   Plaintiffs also may \npursue Count II for injunctive relief against Secretary Wetzel; Count III as against Dr. Paul Noel, \nCorrect Care Solutions, Dr. Cowan, Dr. Kephart, Dr. Frommer, and Wexford; and Count IV as \nagainst Correct Care Solutions and Wexford.  An appropriate order follows. \n \n              BY THE COURT: \n \n \n              /s/ John R. Padova \n  \n              ____________________________ \n              John R. Padova, J. \n30 \n ",

May 24, 2018 \n  Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, Daniel Leyva, and David Maldonado have brought this \nlawsuit against John Wetzel, the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (the \n“DOC”),  and  Paul  Noel,  the  Chief  Medical  Director  of  the  DOC  (collectively  the  “DOC \nDefendants”), as well as two companies that have contracted to provide medical services for the \nDOC and officials and employees of those companies (collectively the “Medical Defendants”), \nasserting claims regarding the medical care provided to DOC inmates who have been diagnosed \nwith  Hepatitis  C  viral  infections  (“HCV”).    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  DOC \nDefendants  have  violated  their  rights  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution by adopting a policy for the treatment of inmates with chronic HCV that fails to \nprovide them with appropriate medical care.1  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring the DOC \nDefendants  to  formulate  and  implement  a  Hepatitis  C  treatment  policy  that  (1)  meets  the \ncommunity standards of care for patients with chronic HCV; (2) ensures that inmates with \nchronic HCV are treated with medically necessary and appropriate direct-acting antiviral drugs \n(“DAAs”);  and  (3)  provides  ongoing  monitoring  and  medical  care  in  accordance  with  the \nstandard of care for such patients’ liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.   \n                                                 \n  1 Plaintiff Chimenti has also brought personal claims for medical malpractice against all \nDefendants. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 2 of 22\nPlaintiffs seek to represent a class of similarly situated inmates of the DOC who have at \nleast  twelve  weeks  remaining  to  serve  on  their  sentences.    Before  the  Court  is  Plaintiffs’ \nRenewed Motion for Class Certification, which is opposed by the DOC Defendants.2  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Motion is granted.  \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs Chimenti, Leyva, and Maldonado all suffer from chronic HCV and were, at the \ntime of the filing of this action, incarcerated in correctional institutions that are part of the DOC.  \n(See Compl. (Docket No. 1)   1-2; DOC Defs.’ Ans. to Compl. (Docket No. 30)   1-2.) \nBeginning in 2011, the United¶ S¶tates Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approve¶d¶ DAAs \nfor the treatment of Hepatitis C.  (Trooskin Rpt., Pls.’ Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. A at 2.)  \nThese drugs, which include Harvoni, are capable of achieving a “sustained virologic response,” \nwhich means “the elimination of the virus[,] for more than 90% of patients.”  (Id. at 2-3.)  Prior \nto the development of DAAs, the standard of care  “was a three-drug treatment containing \nboceprevir or telaprevir, interferon and ribavirin” that “provided, at best, a 70% cure rate, and \nwas  accompanied  by  significant  adverse  side  effects  such  as  anemia,  insomnia,  anxiety, \ndepression, nausea, bone pain, muscle [pain], liver failure, joint pain, memory loss, and death.”  \n(Id. at 2.)  Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Stacey Trooskin, has opined that the use of DAAs is now “the \nstandard of medical care for the treatment of all HCV individuals.”  (Id. at 3.) \n  When  Chimenti,  Leyva,  and  Maldonado  first  asked  to  be  treated  with  DAAs,  their \napplications were rejected by the DOC.  Chimenti began requesting treatment with DAAs in late \n2013, but Defendants denied his requests.  (Pls.’ Counterstatement of Add’l Facts (“PSAF”)   \n                                                 \n¶¶\n  2  The  Medical  Defendants  do  not  oppose  Plaintiffs’  Renewed  Motion  for  Class \nCertification. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 3 of 22\n225-30; DOC Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Counterstatement of Add’l Facts (“DRPCAF”)  225-30.)  \nChimenti filed grievances asking for treatment with DAAs in early 2014, but his grie¶va¶n ces were \ndenied because the DOC did not have a Hepatitis C protocol and had put all Hepatitis C \ntreatment on hold.  (PSAF   226-28; DRPCAF   226-28.)  Chimenti has suffered from Stage \n4 Cirrhosis since at least 20¶0¶0.  (Pls.’ Resp. to Mo¶t¶. for Summ. J., Ex. U at 5.)  In October 2015, \nChimenti was diagnosed with liver cancer.  (PSAF   232; DRPCAF   232.)  Chimenti was \ntreated with DAAs beginning in October 2016.  (PSAF¶   236; DRPCAF ¶ 236.)  \nLeyva filed a grievance with the DOC on Janua¶ry 13, 2015, askin¶g to be treated with the \nnew Hepatitis C drugs.  (Pls.’ Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. V at 2.) The DOC upheld his \ngrievance, but told him that it was  evaluating its treatment options and developing a new \ntreatment protocol and, in the meantime, would only monitor patients with HCV.  (Id. at 3.)  On \nMarch 4, 2015, Leyva sent a letter to the DOC expressing his concern with having to wait for \ntreatment while the DOC developed a new treatment protocol for Hepatitis.  (See id. at 4.)  The \nDOC responded that it was continuing to monitor inmates with HCV while it evaluated treatment \noptions.  (Id.)  On April 7, 2015, Leyva filed a new grievance, asking to be treated with Harvoni.  \n(Id. at 5.)  That grievance was denied.  (Id. at 7-19.)  Leyva still has not received treatment with \nDAAs.  (lst Am. Class Action Compl. (“1st Am. Compl.”   68; DOC Defs.’ Ans. to lst Am. \nCompl.   13.)  Maldonado also filed a grievance asking to b¶e treated with the latest DAAs, but \nhis griev¶ance was rejected because the DOC was developing a new treatment protocol.  (1st Am. \nCompl.   73-74; DOC Defs.’ Ans. to 1st Am. Compl.   16.)  The DOC has not treated \nMaldona¶d¶o with DAAs.  (DOC Defs.’ Ans. to 1st Am. Compl¶.   16.)   \nThe DOC issued a new protocol for the treatment of HC¶V on November 7, 2016.  (DOC \nDefs.’ Statement of Material Facts (“SMF”)   40; Pls.’ Resp. to SMF   40.)  The Hepatitis C \n3 \n¶ ¶\n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 4 of 22\nTreatment  Protocol  does  not  require  the  DOC  to  treat  all  inmates  with  HCV  with  DAAs.  \nInstead, the Protocol requires the DOC to treat the sickest inmates first, and it bases its treatment \ndecisions on an inmate’s fibrosis score.  (SMF   45, 53; Pls.’ Resp. to SMF   45, 53.)   Fewer \nthan 10% of DOC inmates with chronic HCV ¶ha¶ve been treated with DAAs ¶un¶der the Protocol.  \n(PSAF   178; DRPCAF   178.)   \n¶Plaintiffs seek to r¶epresent the following Class: \nall  persons  who  are  currently  incarcerated  in  a  Pennsylvania  Department  of \nCorrections (“DOC”) facility with a diagnosed condition of chronic Hepatitis C, \nand who have at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their \nsentences, and who have a life expectancy of over one year.  \n  \n(Renewed Mot. for Class Cert. at 2.)  As of September 20, 2017, the DOC held 7521 inmates \nwho have been infected with Hepatitis C, 5265 of whom have chronic HCV.  (Wenhold Decl., \nDOC Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. F,   15-16.)  The DOC has treated 297 of those inmates \nwho have chronic HCV with DAAs.  (Id.¶ ¶ 17.) \n  The First Amended Complaint s¶tates four claims for relief.  Count I asserts a claim \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of the three named Plaintiffs and the Class for deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners infected with HCV in violation of the \nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Count II asserts a claim on behalf of the \nthree  named  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  for  violation  of  Article  I,  §  13  of  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution.  Count III asserts a claim for medical malpractice against all Defendants on behalf \nof Chimenti.  Count IV asserts a claim against Correct Care Solutions and Wexford for medical \nmalpractice on behalf of Chimenti.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction on behalf of themselves and the \nClass ordering the DOC to: \n(a)  formulate  and  implement  a  Hepatitis  C  treatment  policy  that  meets  the \ncommunity standards of care for patients with Hepatitis C, (b) that members of \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 5 of 22\nthe Class be treated with medically necessary and the appropriate direct-acting \nantiviral  drugs  based  on  individual  medical  testing  and  medical  evaluation \nregarding each individual’s Hepatitis C status, and (c) that members of the [C]lass \nreceive ongoing monitoring and medical care per the standard of care for their \nindividual  level  of  liver  fibrosis  and  cirrhosis,  including  but  not  limited  to \nappropriate access to and evaluation by a hepatologist and assessment regarding \ntheir need for partial or full liver transplant. \n \n(Id.   98.)  Plaintiffs also seek compensatory and punitive damages for Chimenti, reasonable \nattor¶ney’s fees and costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  (Id.   99-\n102.)  ¶¶\nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  In order to be certified, a class action “‘must satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a) \nand the requirements of either Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3).’”  In re Modafinil Antitrust Litig., 837 \nF.3d 238, 248 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Marcus v. BMW of N.A., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 590 (3d Cir. \n2012)).  “The party seeking certification bears the burden of establishing each element of Rule \n23 by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Marcus, 687 F.3d at 591 (citing In re Hydrogen \nPeroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 307 (3d Cir. 2009)).   Thus, Plaintiffs must establish the \nfollowing four elements: \n(1) the class must be “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” \n(numerosity); (2) there must be “questions of law or fact common to the class” \n(commonality); (3) “the claims or defenses of the representative parties” must be \n“typical of the claims or defenses of the class” (typicality); and (4) the named \nplaintiffs must “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class” (adequacy \nof representation, or simply adequacy).  \n \nIn re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 622 F.3d 275, 291 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-\n(4)).  If Plaintiffs are able to satisfy these requirements, “we consider whether the class meets the \nrequirements of one of three categories of class actions in Rule 23(b).”  In re Nat’l Football \nLeague Players Concussion Injury Litig., 821 F.3d 410, 426 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 6 of 22\nGilchrist v. Nat’l Football League, 137 S. Ct. 591 (2016), and cert. denied sub nom. Armstrong \nv. Nat’l Football League, 137 S. Ct. 607 (2016).  Plaintiffs ask us to certify the Class under Rule \n23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. (23)(b)(2). \n  The DOC Defendants oppose class certification on three grounds.  They first argue that \nthe Class is not sufficiently numerous to be certified.  They next argue that the named Plaintiffs \ndo not have claims that are typical of the claims of the absent Class members.  They finally argue \nthat,  because  the  named  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  not  typical,  they  would  not  be  adequate \nrepresentatives of the members of the Class.3 \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  The Rule 23(a) Factors \n1.  Numerosity \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated that there is “‘[n]o \nminimum number of plaintiffs . . . required to maintain a suit as a class action.’”  Modafinil, 837 \nF.3d at 249 (first alteration in original) (quoting Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226 (3d Cir. \n2001)).  However, in general, “‘if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of \nplaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.’”  Id. at 250 (quoting Stewart, \n                                                 \n  3 The DOC Defendants also contend that we should deny the instant Motion because \nmost of the Class members lack standing as “[f]uture inmates do not have standing to belong in \nthis action where any future injury is not actual or imminent.  Current inmates with a fibrosis \nlevel of zero lack requisite injury for standing.”  (DOC Defs.’ Brief at 4.)  The DOC Defendants, \nhowever, have not explained this argument or supported it with reference to evidence or legal \nauthority.  Accordingly, we do not consider this argument in the context of the instant Motion. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 7 of 22\n275 F.3d at 226-27, and citing Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. 1993)).  “At the \nother end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court has stated in dicta that a class of fifteen was ‘too \nsmall to meet the numerosity requirement.’”  Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw, Inc. v. EEOC, \n446 U.S. 318, 331 (1980)).   \n  The  DOC  Defendants  argue  that  the  class  is  not  sufficiently  numerous  to  support \ncertification because only seven current DOC inmates had satisfied the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct’s (“PLRA”) exhaustion requirement with respect to the claims asserted in this action prior to \nthe filing of the Complaint.  The PLRA provides that “[n]o action shall be brought with respect \nto prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as \nare available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).   The United States Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh  Circuit  has  held  that  “a  class  of  prisoner-plaintiffs  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2) \nsatisfies the PLRA’s administrative exhaustion requirement through ‘vicarious exhaustion,’ i.e., \nwhen ‘one or more class members ha[s] exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to \neach claim raised by the class.’”  Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 2004) \n(alteration in original) (quoting Jones ‘El v. Berge, 172 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1133 (W.D. Wis. \n2001); and citing Hattie v. Hallock, 8 F. Supp. 2d 685, 689 (N.D. Ohio 1998)).  The Eleventh \nCircuit explained that it reached this holding for two reasons.  “First, this rule advances the \npurpose of administrative exhaustion, which, we have stated (albeit in the employment context), \n‘is to put the [administrative authority] on notice of all issues in contention and to allow the \n[authority] an opportunity to investigate those issues.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (quoting \nGriffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1531 (11th Cir. 1985)).  “Second, a different rule, e.g., one \nrequiring  all  class  members  to  exhaust  their  administrative  remedies,  ‘could  impose  an \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 8 of 22\nintolerable burden upon the inmate complaint review system.’”  Id. (quoting Jonas ‘El, 172 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1131-32). “Moreover, in cases like this one, where the composition of the class is \nsubject  to  constant  change  beyond  the  class  members’  control,  it  could  be  extraordinarily \ndifficult for all class members to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit.”  Id. (citing \nJonas ‘El, 172 F. Supp. 2d at 1131). \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has not yet addressed “vicarious \nexhaustion,” but other courts have permitted it in § 1983 class actions filed by inmates.  See \nHubbard v. Danberg, Civ. A. No. 07-745-GMS, 2010 WL 883776, at *6 n.9 (D. Del. Mar. 10, \n2010) (citing Chandler, 379 F.3d 1278; and Meisberger v. Donahue, 245 F.R.D. 627 (S.D. Ind. \n2007) (additional citation omitted)), aff’d, 408 F. App’x 553 (3d Cir. 2010).  For example, the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, like the Eleventh Circuit, has determined \nthat the exhaustion of administrative remedies by one class member is sufficient to satisfy the \nPLRA’s exhaustion requirement for the entire class.  See Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 330 (5th \nCir.  2004)  (concluding  that  one  plaintiff’s  satisfaction  of  the  Mississippi  Department  of \nCorrections’ Administrative Remedy Program was “enough to satisfy the requirement for the \nclass” (citations omitted)).  District Courts in other Circuits have also held that “the PLRA’s \nexhaustion requirement is limited to the class representatives.”  Decoteau v. Raemisch, 304 \nF.R.D. 683, 687 (D. Col. 2014) (citing Chandler, 379 F.3d at 1287; Gates, 376 F.3d at 330; and \nJackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262, 269 (D.C. Cir. 2001)); see also Butler v. Suffolk \nCty., 289 F.R.D. 80, 97 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (finding that “whether the purported class members \nhave exhausted their administrative remedies is irrelevant to the class certification analysis” \nwhere  the  class  representatives  have  satisfied  the  PLRA  exhaustion  requirement);  Scott  v. \nClarke, 64 F. Supp. 3d 813, 832 n.10 (W.D. Va. 2014) (concluding that the efforts of the named \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 9 of 22\nplaintiffs and several other class members, who fully exhausted their prison medical grievances, \n“easily support[ed] a finding of PLRA exhaustion on behalf of the entire class”). \n  We agree with the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning in Chandler and we conclude that, if any \nof  the  named  Plaintiffs,  Chimenti,  Leyva,  and  Maldonado,  have  satisfied  the  PLRA’s \nadministrative exhaustion requirement, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied for all of the \nabsent class members through vicarious exhaustion.  See Chandler, 379 F.3d at 1287.  As we \ndiscussed above, Chimenti, Leyva, and Maldonado all filed grievances with respect to the DOC’s \nrefusal to treat them with DAAs.  The DOC contends that Leyva did not fully exhaust his \nadministrative remedies in accordance with the PLRA before this suit was filed.  However, the \nDOC Defendants do not suggest that either Chimenti or Maldonado has failed to satisfy the \nPLRA’s  exhaustion  requirement.    Consequently,  we  conclude  that  the  PLRA’s  exhaustion \nrequirement is satisfied through vicarious exhaustion and that the class is not limited to the seven \nprisoners with HCV who have personally exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to \ntreatment with DAAs.    \n  The DOC Defendants have submitted evidence that, as of September, 2017, the DOC \nheld 4968 inmates who have chronic HCV and had not been treated with DAAs.  (Wenhold \nDecl.   15-17.)  We conclude that a class of 4968 inmates is sufficiently “‘numerous that \njoinder¶ ¶of all members is impracticable,’” In re Cmty. Bank, 622 F.3d at 291 (quoting Fed. R. \nCiv.  P.  23(a)(1)),  and  that  the  proposed  class  thus  satisfies  the  numerosity  requirement, \nModafinil, 837 F.3d at 249-50 (quotation and citation omitted).  \n2.  Commonality \nCommonality requires  “‘a plaintiff to show that ‘there  are questions of law or  fact \ncommon to the class.’”   Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011) (quoting Fed. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 10 of 22\nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2)).  Consequently, Plaintiffs’ claims “must depend upon a common contention . \n. . [and] [t]hat common contention . . . must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide \nresolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral  to  the  validity  of  each  one  of  the  claims  in  one  stroke.”    Id.    “Rule  23(a)(2)’s \ncommonality requirement ‘does not require identical claims or facts among class member[s].’”  \nMarcus, 687 F.3d at 597 (alteration in original) (quoting Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 265 \n(3d Cir. 2004), abrog. on other grounds by Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 318 n.18).  “‘For \npurposes of Rule 23(a)(2), even a single common question will do.’”  Id. (quoting Dukes, 564 \nU.S. at 359; and citing In re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 597 (3d Cir. \n2009)).   \n  Plaintiffs assert that the following two questions of fact are both central to their claims \nand common to all of the members of the proposed class: \n1.  Whether the treatment regimens utilizing the DAA drugs are the proper, \nnecessary, and standard course of treatment in the medical community; \nand \n \n2.  Whether denial of treatment regimens utilizing the DAA drugs to the \nProposed  Class  will  cause  injury  to  the  class  members,  including \nunnecessary pain and suffering, chronic illness, and death. \n \n(Pls.’ Mem. at 13.)  Plaintiffs also maintain that this case presents a common question of \nlaw,  i.e.,  “whether  the  DOC’s  current  Hepatitis  C  Protocol  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution \nin denying thousands of inmates necessary medical care.”  (Id. at 14.)  Moreover, the \ninjunctive relief that Plaintiffs seek on behalf of the class involves changing the DOC’s \npolicies with regard to treatment of all inmates with chronic HCV. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 11 of 22\n  Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief on behalf of the putative class are based on \nDefendants’ policy regarding the treatment of inmates with chronic HCV.  Thus, in \nconnection with their Eighth Amendment and Pennsylvania constitution claims, “all class \nmembers  share  the  common  question  of  whether  the  [DOC]  Defendants’  policy  or \ncustom of withholding treatment with DAA drugs from individuals who have been or \nwill be diagnosed with chronic HCV constitutes deliberate indifference to  a serious \nmedical need.”  Postawko v. Missouri Dep’t of Corr., Civ. A. No. 16-4219, 2017 WL \n3185155, at *7 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017)  (finding that element of commonality is \nsatisfied in class action asserting 8th Amendment claim against the Missouri Department \nof Corrections because “all class members share the common question of whether the \nDefendants’ policy or custom of withholding treatment with DAA drugs from individuals \nwho have been or will be diagnosed with chronic HCV constitutes deliberate indifference \nto a serious medical need”) (appeal docketed Sept. 19, 2017).  See also Graham v. Parker, \nCiv. A. No. 16-1954, 2017 WL 1737871, at *1, *4 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (finding \nthat element of commonality is met in class action challenging the constitutionality of \n“the State of Tennessee’s policies and procedures for inmates with Hepatitis C” where \nthe proposed class is made up of all inmates with Hepatitis C infections and Plaintiffs \nchallenge “the official policies and practices applicable to all inmates with Hepatitis C”); \nStafford v. Carter, Civ. A. No. 17-0289, 2018 WL 1140388, at *5-6 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 2, \n2018)  (concluding  that  the  commonality  requirement  is  satisfied  in  class  action \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Indiana Department of Corrections’ treatment of \nprisoners who suffer from chronic HCV where the Defendants’ policies regarding the \ntreatment of HCV formed the basis of the common questions of fact and law).  Moreover, \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 12 of 22\nthe relief Plaintiffs seek on behalf of the putative class is an injunction changing the \nDOC’s Hepatitis C Protocol in a manner that will affect all DOC inmates with HCV.  See \nHoffer v. Jones, 323 F.R.D. 694, 697-98 (N.D. Fla. 2017) (concluding that plaintiffs \nsatisfied the commonality requirement in class action challenging the constitutionality of  \nmedical care provided by Florida Department of Corrections to inmates with HCV where \nthere were common questions involving the appropriate standard of care for persons with \nchronic HCV and whether a failure to meet that standard violates the Eighth Amendment, \nand the relief sought with respect to the class  was “limited to changing Defendant’s \npolicies and practices”). We conclude, accordingly, that the commonality requirement is \nmet in this case.   \n3.  Typicality \n  “The  concepts  of  typicality  and  commonality  are  closely  related  and  often  tend  to \nmerge.”  Marcus, 687 F.3d at 597 (citing Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994)). \n“Typicality, however, derives its independent legal significance from its ability to ‘screen out \nclass actions in which the legal or factual position of the representatives is markedly different \nfrom that of other members of the class even though common issues of law or fact are present.’”  \nId. at 598 (quoting 7A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1764 (3d ed. \n2005)).  In order to “determine whether a plaintiff is markedly different from the class as a \nwhole, we consider the attributes of the plaintiff, the class as a whole, and the similarity between \nthe plaintiff and the class.”  Id. (citing Schering Plough, 589 F.3d at 597).  In making our \ndetermination, we consider the following three factors: \n“(1) the claims of the class representative must be generally the same as those of \nthe class in terms  of both (a) the legal theory advanced and  (b) the  factual \ncircumstances underlying that theory; (2) the class representative must not be \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 13 of 22\nsubject to a defense that is both inapplicable to many members of the class and \nlikely  to  become  a  major  focus  of  the  litigation;  and  (3)  the  interests  and \nincentives of the representative must be sufficiently aligned with those of the \nclass.” \n \nId. (quoting Schering Plough, 589 F.3d at 599).  However, “[i]f a plaintiff’s claim arises from the \nsame event, practice or course of conduct that gives rises to the claims of the class members, \nfactual differences will not render that claim atypical if it is based on the same legal theory as the \nclaims of the class.”  Id. (citing Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., 980 F.2d 912, 923 (3d \nCir. 1992)). Indeed, the Third Circuit has “set a ‘low threshold’ for typicality.”  In re Nat’l \nFootball League, 821 F.3d at 428 (quoting Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, \nInc., 259 F.3d 154, 183 (3d Cir. 2001)).  “‘Even relatively pronounced factual differences will \ngenerally not preclude a finding of typicality where there is a strong similarity of legal theories \nor where the claim arises from the same practice or course of conduct.’”  Id. (quoting In re \nPrudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 311 (3d Cir. 1998)).    \n  Plaintiffs contend that the typicality requirement is met in this case because the claims of \nChimenti, Leyva, and Maldonado arise from the same policy as the claims of the members of the \nputative  class,  namely  the  DOC’s  customs  and  policies  regarding  the  treatment  of  HCV.  \nSpecifically, they assert that all three of the named Plaintiffs suffer from chronic HCV and are \npresently, or have been, denied treatment with DAAs pursuant to the DOC’s policies.  Plaintiffs \nrely on Postawko, in which the court found that the typicality requirement was met because the \nclaims of the named plaintiffs and the class they sought to represent all arose from the Missouri \nDepartment of Corrections’ policies for treating inmates with chronic HCV, including their \npolicy of denying treatment with DAAs to certain inmates based on the severity of their disease.  \nPostawko, 2017 WL 3185155, at *11.  The Postawko court found that the named plaintiffs’ \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 14 of 22\nclaims that those policies violated their Eighth Amendment rights were “identical to the claims \nthat could be raised by any member of the class.”  Id.  The Postawko court further found that “all \nputative class members share a common injury of having these policies applied to them and as a \nresult, suffering a significant risk of harm” and, therefore, the named plaintiffs were typical \n“because they, too, are exposed to the same risk.  Like the remainder of the class, they are HCV-\npositive inmates to which the alleged policy has been applied and who have not been treated with \nDAA drugs.”  Id. (citing Alpern v. UtiliCorp. United, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996)); \nsee also Graham, 2017 WL 1737871, at *5 (concluding that “Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the class because they are seeking declaratory, injunctive class-wide relief only that \nmay benefit the entire class”). \n  The DOC Defendants argue, however, that Chimenti, Leyva, and Maldonado are not \ntypical  of  the  class  they  seek  to  represent  because  they  are  subject  to  unique  defenses.  \nSpecifically, the DOC Defendants argue that Chimenti is not a typical plaintiff because he has \nreceived treatment with DAAs and has brought individual claims against Defendants for medical \nmalpractice.  The DOC Defendants also argue that Leyva is not a typical plaintiff because he is \nsubject to the defense that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit.  \nFinally, the DOC Defendants argue that Maldonado is not typical because he is subject to the \ndefense that his claims are moot because he is no longer incarcerated by the DOC.   \n      a.  Chimenti \n  Plaintiffs request certification of a class of individuals who seek injunctive relief.  As we \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that will require Defendants to do the following: \n(a)  formulate  and  implement  a  Hepatitis  C  treatment  policy  that  meets  the \ncommunity standards of care for patients with Hepatitis C, (b) that members of \nthe Class be treated with medically necessary and the appropriate direct-acting \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 15 of 22\nantiviral  drugs  based  on  individual  medical  testing  and  medical  evaluation \nregarding each individual’s Hepatitis C status, and (c) that members of the class \nreceive ongoing monitoring and medical care per the standard of care for their \nindividual  level  of  liver  fibrosis  and  cirrhosis,  including  but  not  limited  to \nappropriate access to and evaluation by a hepatologist and assessment regarding \ntheir need for partial or full liver transplant. \n \n(1st Am. Compl.   98.)  Chimenti has already received treatment with DAAs and, accordingly, \nno longer persona¶lly needs the second of the three items in the requested injunction.  (PSAF   \n232; DRPCAF   232.)  However, there is no basis on the record before us upon which we coul¶d \ndetermine that ¶Chimenti has no interest in requiring the DOC Defendants to formulate and \nimplement a policy for the treatment of Hepatitis C that meets community standards of care or \nthat he no longer needs monitoring and medical care for Cirrhosis or liver fibrosis.  Furthermore, \nChimenti’s claims for monetary damages pursuant to § 1983 and his medical malpractice claims \nare based on the same basic facts as the claims for injunctive relief brought on behalf of the class \npursuant to § 1983 and the Pennsylvania Constitution, i.e., Defendants’ failure to develop a \npolicy to treat all inmates who have chronic HCV in accordance with community standards, \nwhich involves the use of DAAs.  We conclude that the factual differences between Chimenti \nand the members of the putative class are not pronounced and that Chimenti satisfies the “low \nthreshold” for typicality in this case, In re Nat’l Football League, 821 F.3d at 428 (quotation \nomitted), since his claims for monetary damages arise from the same policy and practice as the \nclass’s claim for injunctive relief.  We further conclude, accordingly, that Plaintiffs have satisfied \nthe typicality requirement as to Chimenti.  \n      b.  Leyva \n  The DOC Defendants contend that Leyva is not typical because he is subject to the \ndefense that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in accordance with the PLRA prior \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 16 of 22\nto filing the instant lawsuit.  Specifically, the DOC Defendants argue that Leyva did not exhaust \nhis administrative remedies prior to filing suit because the DOC’s Secretary’s Office of Inmate \nGrievances and Appeals did not issue a decision at the third level on Leyva’s grievance until \nSeptember 8, 2015, nearly three months after this action was initiated on June 12, 2015.4  “If \nexhaustion is incomplete when an inmate files suit, dismissal is mandatory.”   Turner v. Sec’y \nPa. Dep’t of Corr., 683 F. App’x 180, 182 n.1 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 524 (2002); and Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 77 n.12 (3d Cir. 2000)).  Moreover, “[a]n \ninmate cannot cure non-compliance with [the PLRA] by exhausting remedies after filing his \ncomplaint.”  Id. (citation omitted). \n  Leyva filed two grievances regarding the DOC’s failure to treat his HCV with DAAs.  \nThe first was filed on January 13, 2015 and upheld on January 15, 2015.  (See Pls.’ Resp. to Mot. \nfor Summ. J., Ex. V at 2-3.5)  However, even though Leyva’s appeal was upheld, he did not \nreceive treatment with DAAs, and he filed a second grievance on April 7, 2015.  (See id. at 5.)   \nLeyva’s second grievance was denied on April 17, 2015 and he appealed the denial of that \ngrievance on April 25, 2015.  (Id. at 7-8.)  He filed his third level appeal on May 13, 2015, which \nwas denied by the Secretary’s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals on September 8, 2015.  \n                                                 \n  4 The DOC Defendants briefly refer to this argument in their Brief in Opposition to \nRenewed Motion to Class Certification, but do not discuss it in detail.  The DOC Defendants \nexplain the basis of this argument in their  Brief in Support of their  Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Since the Motion for Summary Judgment also forms part of the record before us, we \nhave referred to that document to gain an understanding of the basis of their argument. \n \n  5 Plaintiffs’ Reply to the DOC’s Answer to their Motion for Class Certification cross-\nreferences their discussion of this issue in their Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment, \nso we have considered the argument Plaintiffs make in their Summary Judgment Response and \nthe evidence that they have submitted in connection with that Response. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 17 of 22\n(Id. at 10, 19.)  We therefore find that Leyva did not exhaust his second grievance regarding \ntreatment of his HCV with DAAs prior to the filing of the instant lawsuit on June 12, 2015. \n  Consequently, Leyva is subject to the defense that he did not exhaust his administrative \nremedies prior to bringing suit.  This defense, however, is not unique to Leyva, as the DOC \nDefendants have asserted that it applies to nearly all members of the putative class.  Moreover, \nwe have determined that vicarious exhaustion applies in this case.  See Chandler, 379 F.3d at \n1287.  Since there is no question that Chimenti and Maldonado have properly exhausted their \nadministrative remedies pursuant to the PLRA, the defense of failure to exhaust is not “likely to \nbecome  a  major  focus  of  [this]  litigation.”    Marcus,  687  F.3d  at  598  (quotation  omitted).  \nConsequently, we conclude that Leyva’s failure to fully exhaust his administrative remedies with \nrespect to his second grievance prior to filing suit does not destroy his typicality in this case.  We \nfurther  conclude,  accordingly,  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  typicality  requirement  as  to \nLeyva.   \n      c.  Maldonado \n  The DOC Defendants argue that Maldonado is not a typical plaintiff because he has been \nreleased from the custody of the DOC and his claim is now moot.6  Maldonado was paroled on \nMay 15, 2017.  (DOC Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. H at 2.)  Plaintiffs filed their initial Motion \nfor Class Certification on June 12, 2015 and their Renewed Motion for Class Certification on \nOctober 2, 2017.  (See Docket Nos. 2, 94.)  The Supreme Court has held that “an action brought \n                                                 \n  6 This is another argument that the DOC Defendants only briefly mention in their Brief in \nOpposition to Renewed Motion to Class Certification and discuss more extensively in their \nMotion for Summary Judgment.  See n.4, supra. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 18 of 22\non behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff’s substantive \nclaim.”  United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980).  Consequently, \neven if Maldonado’s personal claim on the merits is now moot, because he is no longer in the \ncustody of the DOC, “‘he retains a “personal stake” in obtaining class certification sufficient to \nassure that Art. III values are not undermined.’”  Williams v. Sec’y Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 447 F. \nApp’x 399, 403 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 404).  Thus, “so long as a plaintiff \nfiles a motion to certify a class when he still has a live claim, the mooting of that claim while the \nmotion is pending precludes the court from reaching the merits but does not preclude it from \ndeciding the certification motion.”  Gayle v. Warden Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst., 838 F.3d 297, \n305 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Holmes v. Pension Plan of Bethlehem Steel Corp., 213 F.3d 124, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2000); and Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 397). As the Third Circuit has explained, “a plaintiff’s \nclaim that he should represent the class is one that is ‘presented . . . in a concrete factual setting \nand [with] self-interested parties vigorously advocating opposing positions,’ and such a claim \n‘remains as a concrete, sharply presented issue’ even if the plaintiff’s individual claims expire.”  \nId.  at  305-06  (alterations  in  original)  (quoting  Geraghty,  445  U.S.  at  403-04).    Moreover, \n“Geraghty’s relation-back doctrine encompasses successive, substantially  similar motions to \ncertify unless and until certification has been finally resolved on Rule 23 grounds.  Id. at 307.  \nWe conclude that this “relation back” doctrine applies to Maldonado even though he was paroled \nprior to the filing of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Class Certification Motion because the first Motion for \nClass Certification was not decided on the merits, but was withdrawn by agreement of the parties \non August 31, 2015.  (See August 31, 2015 Stipulation and Order, Docket No. 21.)  Since \nMaldonado was in the custody of the DOC at the time the original Motion for Class Certification \nwas filed, we conclude that, notwithstanding his subsequent parole, he has “a ‘personal stake’ in \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 19 of 22\nobtaining  class  certification  sufficient  to  assure  that  Art.  III  values  are  not  undermined,” \nWilliams, 447 F. App’x at 403 (quotation omitted), and his claim for class certification is not \nmoot.  Plaintiffs have, therefore, satisfied the typicality requirement as to Maldonado.   For the \nabove stated reasons, we conclude that the typicality requirement is met as to all three named \nPlaintiffs in this case. \n4.  Adequacy of representation \n  “Rule 23(a)(4) requires class representatives to ‘fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class.’”  In re Nat’l Football League, 821 F.3d at 428 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4)).  \nThis requirement “tests the qualifications of class counsel and the class representatives.  It also \naims to root out conflicts of interest within the class to ensure that all class members are fairly \nrepresented in the negotiations.”  Id.  With respect to class counsel, “the adequacy requirement \nassures that counsel possesses adequate experience, will vigorously prosecute the action, and will \nact at arm’s length from the defendant.”  In re Cmty. Bank of N. Virginia Mortg. Lending \nPractices Litig., 795 F.3d 380, 389 (3d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  We have reviewed the \nbiographies of Plaintiffs’ counsel that were submitted in connection with the instant Motion and \nwe conclude that class counsel possess more than adequate experience in both representing \nprisoners and prosecuting class actions.  Moreover, class counsel’s representation of Plaintiffs \nover the more than two years that this case has been ongoing shows that they will vigorously \nprosecute  this  action  and  act  at  arm’s  length  from  Defendants.    We  further  conclude  that \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are clearly qualified to represent the putative class in this action. \n  With respect to the class representatives, “‘the linchpin of the adequacy requirement is \nthe alignment of interests and incentives between the representative plaintiffs and the rest of the \nclass.’”  Id. at 393 (quoting Dewey v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 681 F.3d 170, 183 (3d \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 20 of 22\nCir.  2012).    The  DOC  Defendants  argue  that  the  named  Plaintiffs  will  not  be  adequate \nrepresentatives for the same reasons that their claims are not typical of the claims of the putative \nclass.  We have already rejected these arguments.  We conclude that the interests of the named \nPlaintiffs are sufficiently aligned with the interests of the putative class that the named Plaintiffs \nwill be adequate representatives.  Accordingly, we further conclude that Plaintiffs have satisfied \nthe adequacy of representation requirement. \nB.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n  Plaintiffs seek certification of the class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), which provides that we \nmay certify a class action if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “The Third Circuit has \nheld that Rule 23(b)(2) ‘is almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily seeking injunctive \nrelief’  from  systemic  violations  of  basic  rights.”    P.V.  ex  rel.  Valentin  v.  Sch.  Dist.  of \nPhiladelphia, 289 F.R.D. 227, 235 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58, 64; and \nciting Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 811 (3d Cir. 1984)).  As the Third Circuit has \nexplained, “the injunctive class provision was designed specifically for civil rights cases seeking \nbroad declaratory or injunctive relief for a numerous and often unascertainable or amorphous \nclass of persons.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 59 (quotation omitted).  “What is important for \npurposes of satisfying Rule 23(b)(2) is that the relief sought by the named plaintiffs benefits the \nentire class.”  P.V., 289 F.R.D. at 236 (citing Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 59).   \nThe First Amended Complaint alleges that the DOC’s Hepatitis C Protocol “creates a \nrationing system for the treatment of inmates with” DAAs, resulting in the denial of treatment \nwith DAAs “to over 98% of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C, in direct conflict with community \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 21 of 22\nhealth standards.”  (1st Am. Compl.   29-30.)  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief on behalf of the \nclass that would require the DOC to¶ i¶mplement a new Hepatitis C treatment policy that meets \ncommunity health standard and results in the treatment of patients with medically necessary and \nappropriate DAAs.  (Id.   98.)   \n  We  conclude  th¶at  the  class  satisfies  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  the  DOC’s  Hepatitis  C \nProtocol applies to all members of the class and the requested injunctive relief would provide \nrelief to all class members.  See Postawko, 2017 WL 3185155, at *13 (finding that class of \nindividuals in the custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections who have been diagnosed \nwith chronic HCV and have not been provided treatment with DAAs satisfied Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause the Missouri Department of Corrections had a policy of refusing to consider DAA \ntreatment for an inmate who did not have sufficiently advanced symptoms of chronic HCV and \nthe injunctive relief sought by the class would require defendants to formulate a new policy in \naccordance with the current standard of care).  See also Hoffer, 323 F.R.D. at 699 (concluding \nthat “certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate because a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the proposed class.  Specifically, if this Court \nenters an injunction forcing Defendant to change FDC’s policies and practices with respect to \nHCV treatment, then each member of the proposed class will be able to enjoy those changes.”); \nStafford, 2018 WL 1140388, at *8 (concluding that proposed class of inmates of the Indiana \nDepartment  of  Corrections  diagnosed  with  chronic  HCV  satisfied  the  requirements  for \ncertification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) “[b]ecause this action seeks injunctive relief to prevent \nfuture allegedly illegal deprivations of civil rights” (quotation and citation omitted)).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 107   Filed 05/24/18   Page 22 of 22\nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of \n“establishing each element of Rule 23 by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Marcus, 687 F.3d at \n591.  Accordingly, we certify the following class for the purpose of seeking injunctive relief \npursuant  to  Rule  23(b)(2):    all  persons  who  are  currently  incarcerated  in  a  Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Corrections facility with a diagnosed condition of Chronic Hepatitis C, and who \nhave at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their sentences, and who have a \nlife expectancy of over one year.  An appropriate Order follows. \n              BY THE COURT: \n \n \n              /s/ John R. Padova \n \n              ____________________________ \n              John R. Padova, J. \n22 \n ",

As a result of this \npolicy, this class of DOC inmates suffers from pain, fatigue, depression, and the risk of liver \nfailure, liver cancer, and other severe illness and death.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 4 of 43\n \nDAAs, which are recommended by every relevant major medical association and \napproved by the Food & Drug Administration, provide a full cure for Hepatitis C and would \nprotect those infected from substantial pain and from the risk of the severe consequences of non-\ntreatment. The DOC can provide medical treatment that will cure nearly all of its inmates \nsuffering from Chronic Hepatitis C -- treatment to which they are constitutionally entitled under \nthe current, well-established Eighth Amendment medical community standard of care.  \nNonetheless, the DOC impermissibly rations DAAs and refuses to provide necessary DAA \ntreatment to the overwhelming majority of DOC inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C.  \nThis lawsuit seeks injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) F.R. Civ. P., on behalf of a class \nthat includes thousands of prisoners subject to the DOC’s unconstitutional medical policy.  It \nalso seeks damages on behalf of plaintiff Chimenti.  Plaintiffs sought Rule 23(b)(2) class \ncertification in their original Class Action Complaint, in the First Amended Class Action \nComplaint, and by way of Motions for Class Certification filed contemporaneously with the \nfiling of the original Complaint in 2015, and again on October 2, 2017, on behalf of a class of \nindividuals with Chronic Hepatitis C.  See Pls.’ First Am. Class Action Compl. (Doc. No. 50) \n(“Am. Compl.”); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Doc. No. 2); Plaintiffs’ Renewed \nMotion for Class Certification (Doc. No. 94).1    \nDefendants Wetzel and Noel have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that \n(1) plaintiffs lack standing to sue and that their claims are moot, (2) the DOC policy and \npractices do not violate the Eighth Amendment, (3) plaintiffs have not stated a claim under the \nPennsylvania Constitution, and (4) plaintiff Chimenti’s claim for damages should be dismissed \n                                                 \n1 The first Motion for Class Certification was held in abeyance without prejudice, to permit the \nparties to engage in discovery on the issues presented by that Motion.  On October 2, 2017, \nplaintiffs filed the renewed Motion for Class Certification.  (See Docket No. 94). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 5 of 43\n \non qualified immunity grounds.  As we now show, all of these arguments are without merit and \nthis Court should deny the Motion. \nI.  RULE 56 STANDARDS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA court may grant summary judgment only if “the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  A genuine issue of material \nfact exists if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A factual dispute is material \nwhen it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Id.  In deciding the \nmotion, the Court must “view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and \ndraw all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.”  Thomas v. Cumberland Cty., 749 F.3d 217, \n222 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Bowers v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 475 F.3d 524, 535 (3d Cir. \n2007)).  This standard means that “a district court may not make credibility determinations or \nengage in any weighing of the evidence; instead, the non-moving party’s evidence is to be \nbelieved, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor.”  Montone v. City of Jersey \nCity, 709 F.3d 181, 191 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Marino v. Indus. Crafting Co., 358 F.3d 241, \n247 (3d Cir. 2004)) (internal quotations and alterations omitted); see also Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 \nF.3d 185, 191 n.9 (3d Cir. 2014).  “A motion for summary judgment is properly denied if ‘a fair-\nminded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented.’”  Thomas, 749 \nF.3d at 222 (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). \nUnder these standards, defendants’ arguments are without merit.  First, as a matter of \nlaw, the defendants’ assertions as to lack of standing and mootness of the plaintiffs’ claims are \ndirectly foreclosed by binding authority (entirely ignored in Defendants’ Memorandum of Law) \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 6 of 43\n \nfrom the U.S. Supreme Court and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  Second, in violation of \nthe cardinal principle of summary judgment, the defendants fail to view the facts in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiffs and instead base their arguments on material facts that are in \ndispute.2  On every relevant factor under the Eighth Amendment’s deliberate indifference \nstandard, certain undisputed facts favor the plaintiffs or there are disputed material facts that \nmust be resolved by trial.  Third, plaintiffs’ claim for relief under the Pennsylvania Constitution \nstates a valid basis for relief under state law and plaintiff Chimenti’s individual damage claim \npresents sufficient evident on the issue of causation such that it should not be dismissed. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND3 \nA.  The Hepatitis C Epidemic \nHepatitis C is a viral infection that attacks the liver and causes hepatitis, or liver \ninflammation. Am. Compl. at ¶ 17; see also Mayo Clinic Staff, Hepatitis C Overview, MAYO \nCLINIC, http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/home/ovc-20207365 (last \nvisited Sep. 25, 2017; Hepatitis C Fact Sheet, World Health Organization, \nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/ (last updated July 2017).  Hepatitis C can \nsignificantly impair the liver’s ability to assist the body in digesting essential nutrients, filtering \ntoxins from the blood, and preventing disease.  Am. Compl. at ¶ 17. There are multiple \ngenotypes of Hepatitis C infections, which can be of an acute or chronic nature.  Id. at ¶ 18.  An \nacute infection occurs within the first six months of exposure to the virus and, for most of those \n                                                 \n2 As noted in Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendants’ Statement of Facts, defendants failed to adhere \nto this Court’s procedure requiring the moving party to confer with the opposing party and \nsubmitting a joint statement of undisputed facts.   \n \n3 Facts that are specific to the arguments presented by the defendants are set forth in the \ncorresponding argument sections of this Memorandum of Law. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 7 of 43\n \ninfected, leads to chronic Hepatitis C infection.  Id.  Chronic Hepatitis C infections are serious, \nlong-term illnesses that can last throughout a person’s life.  Id. at ¶ 19. \nHepatitis C infections are spread by transmitting blood from a person infected with \nHepatitis C to another person.  See Report of Dr. Stacey Trooskin (“Trooskin Rep.”), Exhibit \n(Ex.) A at 2.  Some of the major means of transmission are the sharing of needles for injecting \ndrugs, tattooing or piercing, being born to a mother with Hepatitis C, transfusion with infected \nblood or blood products, and sexual contact with a person infected with Hepatitis C.  Id.  Any \ndelay in treatment or rationing of DAAs for treatment “cannot be justified on any medical basis” \nbecause each day without treatment increases the risk of transmitting Hepatitis C to others and \nincreases the likelihood of developing more serious medical problems. Id. at 4-5.  \nHepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis (the irreversible scarring of liver tissue that \ncan cause symptoms such as swelling, increased likelihood of bruising, jaundice, itching, \nnausea, and problems with concentration and memory) and liver cancer, making it the most \ncommon cause of liver transplants.  Id.  Liver transplants are painful, carry a risk of significant \ncomplications, and are nearly impossible for prisoners to obtain.  Am. Compl. at ¶ 21.  They \nalso result in lower recovery rates than treatment with DAA drugs and are very costly.  Id.  \nChronic Hepatitis C infections can also cause serious chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis \n(the scarring of liver tissue), extrahepatic conditions (such as diabetes, muscle damage, nerve \ndamage, heart disease, fatigue, depression, nausea, and problems with concentration and \nmemory), and death.

Current Pennsylvania DOC Policy for HCV Infections \nAt the time when plaintiffs filed their Class Action Complaint on June 12, 2015, the \nDefendants had ceased all medical treatment for Hepatitis C, providing neither the previous \ntriple therapy (boceprevir or telaprevir with interferon) nor DAAs, and had no policy for treating \nany inmate diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C with DAAs.  See Class Action Compl. (Docket \nNo. 1) at 6-11.  Rather, inmates facing severe health consequences as a result of the infection \nwere simply told that the “DOC/BHCS is re-evaluating [their] treatment protocol for Hepatitis C \ngiven the new guidance issued by the [AASLD] and the [IDSA].”  Id. at 11; Letter to Daniel \nLeyva from Christopher Oppman (“Leyva Letter”), Ex. E at 1; Letter to David Maldonado from \nChristopher Oppman (“Maldonado Letter”), Ex. F at 1.   \nOn November 20, 2015, defendants adopted an interim policy, see Ex. P, and then on \nNovember 7, 2016, adopted a policy for treating patients with chronic Hepatitis C (“Hepatitis C \nProtocol” or “Protocol”) that applies to all inmates diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C.  See \n“DOC Access to Health Care Procedures Manual, Section 20 – Hepatitis C Protocol,” (Nov. 7, \n2016) (“Hepatitis C Protocol”), Ex. G.  This policy provides the “clinical guidelines for the \ndiagnosis, management, and treatment of inmate patients with chronic Hepatitis C,” id. at 20-1, \nand therefore is highly consequential on the decision to provide or not to provide DAA \ntreatment. \nThe class members seek injunctive relief against defendants on the ground that the \nHepatitis C Protocol fails to meet the current standard of care for Hepatitis C treatment.6 \n                                                 \n6  As we discuss in detail below, infra 16-18, the Hepatitis C Protocol does not moot plaintiffs’ \ncase because, as the history of this case shows, the Hepatitis C Protocol is subject to change at \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 11 of 43\n \nIndividuals with chronic Hepatitis C are diagnosed on a fibrosis level scale of F-0 to F-4, with \nthe F-4 diagnosis as the most serious stage of the infection.  Am. Compl. ¶ 31.  As the Amended \nComplaint alleges, and the record now shows, individuals at early stages of Chronic Hepatitis C \noften suffer from serious physical and mental symptoms, and, without treatment, most of them \nwill progress to high fibrosis levels.  Id. at ¶¶ 31-32.  \nThe Hepatitis C Protocol purports to prioritize treatment according to the seriousness of \nthe condition, and the DOC claims that it is currently providing DAA treatment to all inmates at \nF-3 or F-4.  Noel Dep. Ex. H, 104-105.  But even if that is true, neither the Protocol nor DOC \npractice mandates or otherwise ensures that such treatment will continue in the future.  The \nrecord is clear that from the time the DOC had no policy, to an interim policy, to the current \nProtocol, that decisions to treat or not treat have been and will continue to be made on the basis \nof non-medical factors such as budget priorities and so-called administrative limitations.  See \ninfra Section IV(B)(2).  Similarly, defendants’ assertion that they will soon begin treating \ninmates at stage F-2 fibrosis is not binding and is at best an aspiration that could easily be \nderailed by non-medical factors.  What is not in dispute is that inmates at stage F-2 are not \ncurrently being treated and that the defendants have no plans to treat those at F-0 or F-1, even \nthough inmates at these stages have over a 70% chance of progressing to serious fibrosis and \nconstitute the largest part of the class of the approximate 5,500 diagnosed inmates.  See \nTrooskin Rep., Ex. A, 2; Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 12; Decl. of Richard Wenhold, Ex. I.  Currently, \nthe DOC treats approximately 5% of the inmates diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

See Hepatitis C Protocol, Ex. G, \n20-10; Noel Dep. Ex. H, 18.

The Plaintiffs Have Standing to Seek Injunctive Relief on \n            Their Constitutional Claims and None of the Claims are Moot. \n \n  Defendants’ first and major contention on summary judgment is that plaintiffs lack \nstanding to seek prospective injunctive relief because one is no longer in the DOC (Maldonado), \none has already received DAA treatment (Chimenti), and one has allegedly failed to fully \nexhaust administrative remedies (Leyva).  Not only are the defendants wrong in asserting that \nplaintiff Leyva did not exhaust administrative remedies7 (see Plaintiff’s Counterstatement of \nFacts), but there is no need to delve into the factual questions of exhaustion, treatment, or release \nfrom the DOC since the defendants concede that at least two of the named plaintiffs, Chimenti \nand Maldonado, had standing to sue at the time of the filing of the Class Action Complaint on \nJune 12, 2015.  Under controlling law in the United States Supreme Court and the Third \nCircuit—none of which is cited or discussed by the defendants—where a plaintiff has standing at \nthe initiation of a class action law suit, and where the claims are inherently transitory, standing \nfor class representation and class certification is not lost, and the claims do not become moot if \nthe named plaintiff is either granted the relief sought or because of other changed circumstances \nthat deprive the plaintiff of standing to pursue his individual claims. \nIn the circumstances of this case, plaintiffs’ standing to sue as class representatives \nrelates back to the date of the filing of the Complaint or filing of the first motion for class \ncertification.  See Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980) (holding that “an \n                                                 \n7 Daniel Leyva’s initial grievance seeking DAA treatment was “upheld.”  See Leyva grievances, \nEx. V.  Once a grievance has been granted or upheld, there is no need to appeal the grievance.  \nDiaz v. Palakovich, 2001 WL 4867549, *4 (3d Cir. Oct. 14, 2011) (holding that there is no need \nto appeal outcomes of “grievance resolved” or “uphold inmate”). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 14 of 43\n \naction brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named \nplaintiff’s claim”); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975) (holding that termination of \na class representative’s claim did not moot the claims of unnamed class members); Sosna v. \nIowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399–401 (1975) (same); see also Gayle v. Warden Monmouth Cty. Corr. \nInst., 838 F.3d 297, 305 (3d Cir. 2016) (“[C]lass claims can breathe life into an otherwise moot \ncase for they ‘allow a plaintiff to continue seeking class certification in certain circumstances \neven though his individual claim for relief has become moot.’”) (quoting Richardson v. Bledsoe, \n829 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir. 2016)).   \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that where federal class-action plaintiffs will not \nbe in a system they are challenging in a class action, they can continue to litigate their claims by \nvirtue of the “inherently transitory” exception.  In Geraghty, the plaintiff brought a class action \nchallenging the validity of federal guidelines for parole release and was released from prison \nduring his class action.  445 U.S. at 393-94.  The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff had \nstanding to litigate class certification in a suit seeking prospective relief because his claim was \n“so inherently transitory that [a] trial court w[ould] not have even enough time to rule on a \nmotion for class certification before [his] individual interest expire[d].”  Id. at 399, 403.   \nIn Gerstein, the Supreme Court permitted a class of prisoners seeking preliminary \nprobable-cause hearings to continue requesting prospective relief, even though the named \nplaintiffs’ individual claims had expired since their initial filing.  420 U.S. at 110 n.11 (“Pretrial \ndetention is by nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given individual could have his \nconstitutional claim decided . . . before he is either released or convicted.”).  In Sosna, the \nSupreme Court permitted a woman whose individual claim had expired to continue seeking \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 15 of 43\n \nprospective relief on behalf of a class challenging Iowa’s one-year residency requirement for \ndivorce.  419 U.S. at 399–401. \nRelying on these cases, the Third Circuit and district courts within the Circuit have \nconsistently held that plaintiffs with expired individual claims retain standing to pursue \nprospective relief under the “inherently transitory” exception.  In Richardson v. Bledsoe, the \nCourt ruled that a prisoner challenging a policy alleged to violate the Eighth Amendment (by not \nprotecting inmates from attacks by others), but whose individual claims had been mooted by his \ntransfer to another prison, had continued standing even though his motion for class certification \nwas not filed until after his transfer.  829 F.3d 273, 276 (3d Cir. 2016).  The Court determined \nthat the claim was inherently transitory and that under the relation back doctrine, where the \ninitial complaint was styled as a putative class action, standing was preserved and no formal \nmotion for class certification was necessary.  Id. at 286.  As the Court explained, to require that a \nclass certification motion be filed before the change of circumstances would create an unseemly \nrace in which the plaintiff would seek class certification before defendants took steps to moot the \nclaim by actions that would remove personal standing.  Id. at 283.  Here, of course, plaintiffs are \nin an even stronger position as they filed the initial class action motion well before their personal \nclaims became moot. \nWhere a class motion is filed but, as here, by agreement among the parties and the Court, \nthe motion is either held in abeyance or withdrawn without prejudice to allow discovery on the \nclass issues, and then re-filed in a timely manner under the Court’s Scheduling Order, standing is \npreserved.  In Gayle, 838 F.3d 297, plaintiffs filed three motions for class certification, the first \nwhile they had individual standing, but the second and third after their personal claims for \ninjunctive relief became moot.  The Court ruled that since the first two motions were not \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 16 of 43\n \nresolved on the merits, and the first motion was denied solely to allow completion of discovery, \nthe later motions were functionally a continuation of the original motion for class certification \nand, therefore, “there was no denial of class certification based on a Rule 23 analysis or other \nintervening event that could be deemed to break the jurisdictional chain.” Id. at 307.  Gayle \ndirectly controls disposition of this issue in this case.  See also Wilson v. Gordon, 822 F.3d 934, \n942-43 (6th Cir. 2016) (withdrawal of motion for class certification to allow for processing of \nplaintiffs’ administrative claims for certain benefits was not a voluntary relinquishment of their \nfederal court claims and did not moot the class claims). \nCourts in this district have also applied these principles.  In Bowers v. City of \nPhiladelphia, Judge Surrick ruled that pre-trial detainees alleging prison overcrowding were \npermitted to seek prospective relief on behalf of a class even though they were released from \nprison before class certification.  No. 06-CV-3229, 2006 WL 2818501, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, \n2006).  As the Bowers court observed, while the plaintiffs were “no longer pre-trial detainees \nenduring the conditions alleged in the[ir] [c]omplaint, the duration of pre-trial custody d[id] not \nlast much more than a week.”  Id.  Hence, it would be “impossible . . . to rule on class \ncertification before any of the named [p]laintiffs’ personal stakes in injunctive relief expire[d].”  \nId.  Were the court to “deny class certification or dismiss the case for lack of standing by the \nnamed [p]laintiffs, the alleged harm would never receive judicial review.”  Id.  Because the \nplaintiffs alleged constitutional violations and “given that it [wa]s certain that other pre-trial \ndetainees” were being detained—and would “in the future be detained”—under the allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions, their case was inherently transitory.  Id.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs \nhad “standing to bring th[eir] class action for injunctive and declaratory relief.”  Id. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 17 of 43\n \nSimilarly, in Sourovelis v. City of Philadelphia, 103 F. Supp. 3d 694, 702-704 (E.D. Pa. \n2015), Judge Robreno ruled that since it was unlikely that an individual plaintiff could be subject \nto a forfeiture action for the entire duration of plaintiffs’ class action (the plaintiffs were in the \nsystem under challenge for seven months and ten months respectively), the filing of the motion \nfor class certification was sufficient to preserve the named plaintiffs’ standing to seek class \ncertification.  See also Williams v. City of Phila., 270 F.R.D. 208, 220 (E.D. Pa. 2010) \n(permitting named plaintiffs challenging prison conditions to continue seeking prospective relief \non behalf of a class after their pre-certification release from custody; if plaintiffs with pending \nclass-certification motions were not allowed to continue litigating their claims, it would create a \n“black hole . . . to constantly add new named plaintiffs or file new class-action complaints when \npreviously named plaintiffs’ claims are resolved.”) \nAccordingly, there is no basis for dismissal on standing or mootness grounds.    \nB.  The DOC Policies and Practices Violate The Eighth Amendment Rights of                                 \nthe Inmate Class to be Free from Deliberate Indifference to the Need for \nMedical Treatment Where Available Treatment Would Provide a Full \nMedical Cure for the Serious Medical Condition of the Class Members \n1.  The Governing Eighth Amendment Standards \nIn the recent ruling on the defendants’ motion to dismiss the First Amended Class \nAction Complaint, this Court set forth the standards to be applied in an Eighth Amendment \nchallenge to the denial of medical treatment for prisoners: \n“Deliberate indifference can be shown by a prison official \n‘intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or \nintentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.’”  \nRhines v. Bledsoe, 388 F. App’x 225, 227 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05).  “A medical need is serious if it ‘has \nbeen diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is \nso obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity \nfor a doctor’s attention.’”  Id. (quoting Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst. \nInmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)).  Moreover, \n“to be considered ‘serious,’” the medical need must be such that “a \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 18 of 43\n \nfailure to treat can be expected to lead to substantial and \nunnecessary suffering, injury, or death.’”  Tsakonas v. Cicchi, 308 \nF. App’x 628, 632 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Colburn v. Upper \nDarby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 2023 (3d Cir. 1991)). \n \nA prison official acts with deliberate indifference to a serious \nmedical need “when he knows of and disregards an excessive risk \nto inmate health or safety.”  Brown v. Thomas, 172 F. App’x 446, \n450 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  “The official \nmust be aware of the facts from which an inference would be \ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must \nalso draw the inference.”  Id. (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).   \n \nChimenti v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civil Action No. 15-3333, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124892, at \n*17-18 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 8, 2017). \nApplying this standard, the Court ruled that the allegations of the First Amended \nComplaint sufficiently alleged the level of deliberate indifference necessary to state a federal \nconstitutional claim.  The Court specifically rejected the defendants’ arguments that (1) the \nDOC deviations from the community standard of care for Chronic Hepatitis C reflect only \n“mere disagreements” as to the treatment regimen and, therefore, are not actionable under the \nEighth Amendment, and (2) where cost considerations are relevant to the decision to provide a \ncertain type of treatment, there cannot be a finding of deliberate indifference.  Id. at 14-21.     \n2.  Defendants’ Arguments in Support of the Motion for Summary \nJudgment Are Without Merit \n \nOn summary judgment, defendants make the same arguments rejected by this Court on \nthe motion to dismiss.  These arguments fail again as plaintiffs have produced evidence, much \nof which is from deposition testimony of the defendants, other officials in the DOC, and the \nDOC medical expert, that fully supports the Eighth Amendment claims credited by this Court on \nthe motion to dismiss.  Further, to the extent, the defendants argue related or re-packaged \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 19 of 43\n \ngrounds for summary judgment, there are seriously disputed issues of fact that preclude \nsummary judgment.   \na.  Plaintiffs at F-3 and F-4 are Entitled to DAA Treatment and Their Claims \nare not Moot \n \nDefendants assert that the Protocol and related DOC practices with respect to DAA \ntreatment do not show deliberate indifference to inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C on the ground \nthat the most serious conditions (F-3 and F-4) have been and will continue to be treated, that \nthose at F-2 will be treated in 2018, and that there is no need to treat those at F-0 and F-1. These \narguments are all without merit.  \nAs to inmates at F-3 and F-4, defendants essentially concede that they are \nconstitutionally entitled to DAA treatment.  The testimony of Dr. Cowan, Dr. Noel and Dr. \nKendig, the three DOC medical witnesses (including their own expert witness), detail the \nserious nature of Hepatitis C at F-3 and F-4, including high risks of liver cancer, liver failure, \nand death.  None of these witnesses assert that costs or any other non-medical factors would \njustify withholding DAA treatment for these patients.  See Kendig Dep. Ex. K, 72 (“I would \nargue that treating F-3 and F-4 is medically necessary.”); id. at 85 (“patients are entitled to be \ntreated even if . . . [they are] not [at] substantial risk of death”); Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 60 (in \ntreating F-3 and F-4, DOC is treating the “sickest” of the Hepatitis C patients); id. at 62 (he \nknows of no study that contradicts any of the recommendations for treatment in AASLD \nGuidance); Noel Dep. Ex.

See Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v.

The record of this case shows \nthat the DOC policies regarding treatment of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C are highly \nmalleable, subject to change depending on circumstances and conditions unrelated to medical \nstandards and needs, and provide only general guidance under a vague prioritization standard.  \nWhen the Complaint in this case was first filed, there was no protocol and no treatment of any \ninmate with Hepatitis C with DAA.  Thereafter, in 2015 (notably after the complaint in this \naction had been filed), an Interim Protocol was adopted which did not mandate DAA treatment \nfor any inmate and provided only general guidelines for “prioritization” of those with this \ncondition.  In November 2016, the current Protocol was adopted, and continued the use of only \ngeneralized guidelines for treatment. \nThe record makes clear that “prioritization” is a code-word for the rationing of DAAs \nwithout regard to medical necessity.  In discussions leading up to the adoption of the protocol, \nDr. Scharff, then the DOC Chief of Clinical Services, Bureau of Health Care Services, and \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 22 of 43\n \nEugene Ginchereau, Assistant State Medical Director, provided Dr. Noel with suggested \nguidelines as to which patients should be provided DAA treatment.  These guidelines advised \nthat inmates with an APRI score at or greater than 1.0 should be treated.  Noel Dep. Ex. H, 81-\n82.  But Dr. Noel rejected that standard—not because the medical condition did not warrant \nDAA treatment—but because it created too large a number of inmates to be treated.  Id.  This \npoint was repeated in a February 18, 2015 email from Dr. Noel stating that use of elastography \nscience would create “a bucket of potential patients which is too large to treat.”  Ex. L.  Left \nunsaid was the fact that elastography is the “gold standard” for determining fibrosis levels.  See \nCowan Dep. Ex. D, 42-43.  Dr. Noel’s refusal to provide treatment based on this test is but \nanother example of non-medical factors driving treatment decisions.  In any event, the protocol \ndoes not require DAA treatment for any specific individual or even for classes of inmates and the \ncurrent practice of treating those at F-3 and F-4 could be changed at any time and for any reason.  \nSee Trooskin Dep. Ex. A, 8-9. \nb.  Plaintiffs at F-0 to F-2 are Entitled to DAA Treatment \nThe DOC assertion that those at F-2 will be treated in 2018, whether or not based on the \nrecognition that patients at that stage are in need of the DAA treatment for a serious medical \ncondition, cannot moot the claim for injunctive relief.  The DOC’s statement of intent to treat \nthose at F-2 in 2018, communicated by counsel for DOC is aspirational only, is not part of any \nbinding budget plan, is not legally enforceable, and is subject to change at any time and for any \nreason.  Moreover, defendants make no argument that they are not entitled to such treatment \nunder the Eighth Amendment. \nThe defendants’ argument that inmates at F-0 and F-1 have no medical need for DAA \ntreatment fails to account for their existing medical symptoms and the risk that non-treatment \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 23 of 43\n \nwill lead to more severe and life threatening conditions.  The denial of DAA treatment to all \ninmates at F-1 and F-0 is defensible only if there is no dispute as to whether these Chronic \nHepatitis C inmates are suffering from a serious medical condition.8  Plaintiffs have set forth \nabundant evidence that demonstrates the need for treatment with DAAs for all persons with \nChronic Hepatitis C.  As discussed above, every major medical association and organization that \nis concerned with Hepatitis C treatment urges universal treatment, and they do so in recognition \nof both the need to alleviate painful and debilitating symptoms and to prevent even more serious \nconsequences as these patients move to higher fibrosis levels.  Dr. Noel and Dr. Trooskin agreed \nthat the AASLD Guidance was one of universal treatment with DAAs, except for medical \ncontraindicators.  See Noel Dep., Ex. H, 77; Trooskin Dep., Ex. J, 21. \nAs plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Trooskin has testified and has documented in her expert report, \nsignificant numbers of patients at F-0 to F-2 are suffering from serious medical symptoms, both \nhepatic and extra-hepatic.9  These symptoms include fatigue, sore muscles, joint pain, kidney \ninjury, rashes, and depression.  As Dr. Trooskin states: \nIndividuals who meet the standards set forth by the AASLD and \nIDSA, but who are excluded from receiving care, are put at \nsignificant risk of many medical complications of HCV.  HCV is \nknown to have extrahepatic manifestations, described as effects on \norgan systems outside the liver.  Without treatment, individuals \n                                                 \n8 It is important to note that even if the defendants were correct on this issue—that those at F-0 \nand F-1 are not suffering a serious medical condition—the DOC would still have the burden to \nshow that it uses tests and measures that reliably reflect the F stage of every inmate with chronic \nHepatitis C.  But as the defendants concede, infra, the tests currently in use in the DOC are \nhighly imperfect and mis-identify hundreds of inmates who are actually at F-2 – F-4 as F-0 or F-\n1. \n9 As examples of individuals with extra-hepatic conditions resulting from Chronic Hepatitis C, \nDaniel Leyva complains of pain and aches throughout his body, and according to the DOC \nrecords, he has an APRI score of 0.179 but has not had an elastography exam so his F score is \nunknown.  See Leyva grievances, Ex. V.  Salvatore Chimenti has stage 4 cirrhosis and now \nsuffers from extreme fatigue, memory loss, and has developed diabetes due to Hepatitis C.  See \nDr. Cecil Rep., Ex. Q. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 24 of 43\n \nmay be needlessly exposed to depression, fatigue, sore muscles, \njoint pain, kidney injury, diabetes or glucose intolerance, certain \ntypes of rashes or autoimmune diseases.  Without treatment, \nindividuals with HCV are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis, \nliver cancer and liver failure requiring transplant.  Furthermore, \nonce individuals develop advanced liver disease they must undergo \ncancer screening at regular intervals for the rest of their life even \nafter they are cured of their HCV.   \n \nTrooskin Rep., Ex. A, 5; See also Trooskin Dep., Ex. J, 47-48. \n \nMoreover, Dr. Trooskin and other experts have documented that for those at F-0 and F-\n1, delay in treatment is dangerous:  \nMere observation and “monitoring” of HCV patients, with no \nmedical treatment is medically inappropriate, falls below the \nstandard of care, and risks the health of the individual with HCV.  \nDelaying treatment has a variety of adverse effects including \nincreasing the risk of death, causing irreversible liver damage, and \nneedlessly prolonging suffering associated with the disease.  From \na public health perspective, observation without treatment risks \nspreading the disease to others.  It is critical that patients with \nchronic HCV be treated before the liver has been damaged by the \nvirus.  Delaying treatment while that individual’s liver degrades \nsignificantly increases the risk of death from cancer, liver failure \nand a liver transplant.  Once a person reaches a fibrosis score of F3 \nher chance of getting liver cancer is so significant that it is \nrecommended that, even after having been cured with a DAA, the \nindividual undergo twice yearly liver imaging surveillance for liver \ncancer. \n \nDelay in treatment can cause damage to other vital organs.  It is a \nsystematic disease that, if untreated, can cause heart attacks, \nfatigue, joint pain, depression, sore muscles, arthritis, and, at times, \npremature death.  Gill, Ghazinian, Manch Gish, Hepatitis C virus \nas a systemic disease; reaching beyond the liver, HEPATOLOGY \nINTERNATIONAL, Vol. 9, No. 4 (2015).  I strongly agree with \nthe current HCV Guidance which provide that “[b]ecause of the \nmany benefits associated with successful HCV treatment, \nclinicians should treat HCV-infected patients with antiviral therapy \nwith the goal of achieving an SVR, preferably early in the course \nof their chronic HCV infection before the development of severe \nliver disease and other complications.”   \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 25 of 43\n \nId. at 6. 10 \n \nThe defendants and their witnesses concede a number of these points.  Thus, both Dr. \nNoel and Dr. Cowan testified that they had no basis to disagree with any of the reasons provided \nby the AASLD in its official Guidance for the need for universal treatment, including the \npresence of symptoms at early stages; the increased effectiveness of DAA treatment at the \nearliest possible point of intervention in the disease cycle; and preventing otherwise significant \nsuffering, preventable cancer, liver failure, and death. See Noel Dep., Ex. H, 46-50; Cowan \nDep., Ex. D, 62-63.  Further, Dr. Noel, Dr. Cowan and Dr. Kendig have all acknowledged the \npoint made by Dr. Trooskin that patients at F-0 to F-2 can and do suffer from a range of \nsymptoms caused by Chronic Hepatitis C.  See, e.g., Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 38-40; 117-119 \n(significant number of patients at F-0 may have extra –hepatic symptoms); Cowan Dep., Ex. D, \n49; 51-53; Noel Dep., Ex. H, 53-59; 125; 142 (severe fatigue can be present at F-1-2). \nTo the extent that Dr. Noel and Dr. Kendig take issue with the AASLD Guidance and \nthe national community standard of universal treatment, they do so on the basis of plainly \nerroneous understandings of the standard of care for prisoners under the Eighth Amendment.  \nDr. Kendig asserted that, under the Protocol, treatment for prisoners is provided for those with a \ncurrent “life threatening liver condition,” Kendig Report, Ex. B, 5, and for those with “severe \nillness” or facing “death.”  Id.  Dr. Cowan referenced treatment for those with “irreversible \ndamage” or “imminent risk of death.”  Noel Dep., Ex. H, 96.  Dr. Noel testified consistently \n                                                 \n10 Defendants also argue that patients are not harmed due to the slow progression of the disease, \nbut some patients progress and develop fibrosis at a fast rate, and that there is no way to \ndetermine who will progress more quickly.  See Trooskin Dep. 38:7-22.  Dr. Cowan also \nadmitted that you rarely know what “time zero” is, i.e. when the person first became infected and \nthus when the clock starts.  See Cowan Dep. 124:4-5.  Dr. Trooskin gave an example of a patient \nshe treated in her early 20s, who likely had only been infected for four to five years but had \nalready advanced to F-3 in that short time frame.  See Trooskin Dep., Ex. J, 79. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 26 of 43\n \nwith a belief that treatment is necessary only to prevent “irreparable harm.”  Noel Dep., Ex. H, \n79; 94.   \nIn an attempt to explain his view, Dr. Kendig, without any documentary proof, testified \nthat inmates would receive treatment before the onset of harmful consequences, but he could not \npoint to a single case file that showed treatment before the inmate was at F-3 or F-4. Id. 89-91.  \nAnd, in discovery, notwithstanding requests for such documentation, the DOC has failed to \nprovide any such evidence.  See Ex. M.  Dr. Kendig agreed that research studies showed that \n4.7% of patients at F-2, and 2.3% of patients at F-0 and F-1 would advance to liver failure \nand/or liver cancer without treatment and that applying that analysis to the DOC Hepatitis C \npatient list, approximately 420 patients would be in the very high risk category.  Kendig Dep., \nEx. K, 91-96.  Moreover, an implication of Dr. Kendig’s Report is that thousands of inmates \nwho are not treated with DAAs will suffer “harmful health consequences.”  Id.at 89. \nThe constitutional standards offered by Dr. Kendig, Dr. Noel, and Dr. Cowan are wide \nof the Eighth Amendment mark.  As we set forth above, and as this Court has already ruled, one \nneed not be near death, already have suffered irreversible damage, or have a life-threatening \ncondition to be entitled to treatment.  To the contrary, the standard is one of a “serious medical \ncondition,” which includes many conditions that do not pose a risk of imminent death, and \nwhich would include the “harmful health consequences” referenced by Dr. Kendig.  Treatment \nis necessary for any conditions that cause significant pain, disability, injury, or illness, far before \nthere is the irreversible damage. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004); \nMonmouth Cy. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 346-47 (3d Cir. 1987).  The \nSupreme Court and the Third Circuit have consistently ruled that one who is exposed to \nconditions that could eventually lead to serious illness or death, even without any current \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 27 of 43\n \nsymptoms, is entitled to judicial relief.  See, e.g., Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 \n(1993) (exposure to dangerous levels of second-hand smoke; “It would be odd to deny an \ninjunction to inmates who plainly proved [a] life-threatening condition . . . on the ground that \nnothing yet had happened to them.”); Atkinson v. Taylor, 316 F.3d 257, 264-66 (3d Cir. 2003) \n(same). See also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994); Postawko v. Mo. Dep’t of \nCorrections, 2017 WL 1968317, *7 (W.D. Mo. May 11, 2017) (Hepatitis C infected inmates \n“not required to suffer ‘imminent, life threatening circumstances’ in order to allege deliberate \nindifference).  In sum, with respect to inmates at F-2, 3 and 4, an injunction is necessary to \nensure that promised DAA treatment will in fact be provided.  Further, on the question of \nwhether DAA treatment is necessary for those at F-O and F-1, disputed issues of material fact \npreclude summary judgment. \nc.  Defendants’ Reliance on APRI Scores to Determine DAA Treatment is \nEvidence of Deliberate Indifference to the Need for Medical Treatment \n \nMoreover, even if the defendants were correct in their assessment of the seriousness of \nthe Hepatitis C infection based on F scores, treatment decisions could only be valid if the tests \nused to measure the F score are valid and accurate.  But, as every expert in this case has \ntestified, that is quite definitively not the case in the DOC. The DOC makes a determination of \nthe F-score primarily from an “APRI score,” which is based on blood tests that provide a ratio \nderived from the level of an enzyme “AST” in the blood and blood platelet levels.   \nAPRI scores are reflective of F scores along the following approximate scale:  APRI 0-\n0.5=F-0; APRI 0.5-1=F-1; APRI 1-1.5=F-2; APRI 1.5-2=F-3; APRI 2 or more=F-4.  See D. \nAppx. N, Noel Decl. at 4.  All of the medical witnesses in this case have stated that the APRI \nscore is accurate only at the extremes of the F scale and the score is highly imprecise in the \ncritical middle ranges.  As Dr. Cowan testified, an APRI score of 1.5 fails to reveal cirrhosis (F-\n25 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 28 of 43\n \n4) in 35% of the cases and an APRI score as low as 1.0 fails to reveal cirrhosis in 23% of the \ncases.  See Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 42-47.  Dr. Kendig referenced a study that showed that 48% of \npatients with APRI scores at or above 1.0 were at a significantly higher F score.  Kendig Dep., \nEx. K, 55-56.  Thus, in a DOC population of approximately 5500 inmates with Chronic \nHepatitis C, there will be hundreds of inmates with APRI scores that fail to measure the true \nseverity of their disease.11  Moreover, in the data provided by the DOC 179 patients were listed \nwithout any APRI score.  Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 71.  Dr. Kendig stated that any privatization \nprotocol requires accurate F-scores, id. 65, but that under the DOC testing process, which does \nnot include the most advanced and accurate tests, patients with conditions that he views as \nsufficiently serious to require DAA treatment will be missed. Id. at 69.12 \n  The DOC does not routinely use more precise tests, including FibroScan, a type of \nultrasound known as “transient elastography,” that all experts credit as the most reliable \nindicator of fibrosis levels.  See Trooskin Rep., Ex. J, 8; Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 61-62; 66-67.  \nDefendants rely almost exclusively on a test that is highly flawed.  Accordingly, even under the \ndefendants’ position as to what F-score requires DAA statement, hundreds of inmates in that \ncategory are being denied necessary DAA treatment.  See Postawko v. Mo. Dep’t of \nCorrections, 2017 WL 1968317, at *6-7(noting highly imprecise nature of APRI scores). \n \n \n                                                 \n11 As one example, inmate C.S. (No. XX-XX58) had stage 4 cirrhosis (F-4), yet according to the \nDOC tracking spreadsheet, had an APRI score of under 0.5 (actual APRI recorded was 0.414).  \nSee Inmate C.S. medical records, Ex. W. \n12 In Exhibit F to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Richard Wenhold provides data \nas of September, 2017 as to the breakdown by APRI scores for inmates with Chronic Hepatitis \nC.  The current data would not in any material way affect that earlier testimony and analysis.  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 29 of 43\n \nd.  The Relevance of Community Medical Standards \nThis Court has rejected the DOC’s argument that inmates are not entitled to medical \ntreatment under generally accepted and established community medical standards of care.  In \nthis case, there is no dispute as to the community standard of care for persons with Chronic \nHepatitis C: treatment with DAAs.  Every national health organization that deals with this \ncondition advocates universal treatment of all such patients (subject only to special and limited \nexceptions for persons with a very short life expectancy or other medical conditions which \ncontra-indicate DAA treatment).  DAAs provide a full cure with no or very infrequent side \neffects and prevent the disease from progressing to a point where there is suffering from \nphysical and emotional symptoms as well as to serious risks of cancer, liver failure, and death.  \nThe AASLD, the Veterans Administration, the Center for Disease Control, and Medicare \npromote and/or provide universal treatment; and in Pennsylvania, Medicaid will be providing \nDAA to all Chronic Hepatitis C patients as of January 2018.13    \nCourts have looked to established community care standards in Eighth Amendment \nanalysis: indeed, for chronic and or infectious conditions like HIV, Hepatitis C, diabetes, and \nhigh blood pressure, it is difficult to understand how established community medical protocols \nwould not be generally applicable in the prison medical setting.  Further, the DOC has \nrepeatedly stated that medical care, and in particular medical care for inmates with Hepatitis C, \n                                                 \n13 The DOC argument that the VA does not have a policy of universal treatment is incorrect.  See \nCowan Dep., Ex. D, 24 (VA and CDC recommend universal treatment); see also Department of \nVeterans Affairs New Release, “VA Expands Hepatitis C Drug Treatment, dated March 9, 2016, \navailable at https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2762; (“The Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) today announced that it is now able to fund care for all Veterans with \nhepatitis C for Fiscal Year 2016 regardless of the stage of the patient’s liver disease”); VA Fact \nSheet, dated September 2017, available at https://www.hepatitis.va.gov/pdf/VA-HCV-Fact-\nSheet.pdf (“All Veterans with hepatitis C in VA care are eligible for treatment.”). \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 30 of 43\n \nis provided on the basis of community care standards.  In responding to grievances filed by each \nof the named plaintiffs, the DOC explicitly stated that their care was governed by “community \nstandards of care” for this disease.  See Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 19-21; see also Letter to Leyva, Ex. \nE; Letter to Maldonado, Ex. F.  Further, the contracts between the DOC and its medical provider \nspecify community standards of care.  See Noel Dep., Ex. H, 13-16; 19-20.   \nThe DOC seeks to avoid community standards by characterizing this case as a simple a \nmatter of “disagreement” among experts, and arguing that a prisoner is not entitled to treatment \nof his choice, even if offered in the community.  D. Mem. at 18.  But as this Court stated in its \nruling on the motion to dismiss, the allegations (and now the proof) in this case do not permit \nsuch an argument: if Chronic Hepatitis C is a serious medical condition, there is only one course \nof effective treatment, that which provides DAAs.  See Chimenti, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124892, \nat *18-32.  Deliberate indifference can be established even where some “treatment” or medical \noversight is provided, particularly where, as here, what is offered as treatment falls well short of \nestablished community medical practice standards.  See, e.g., Keller v. Cty. of Bucks, 209 F. \nApp’x 201, 204-05 (3d Cir. 2006) (affirming verdict of Eighth Amendment violation for failing \nto properly treat MRSA infections even though plaintiff was seen by medical staff and was \nprovided with antibiotics); White v.

May 11, 2017) (failure to provide DAA treatment for Hepatitis C \ninmates is denial of any treatment and not a mere dispute as to proper course of treatment).  \nAs this Court stated in the Opinion on the motion to dismiss, the DOC Protocol has \nalready been found to be constitutionally deficient, citing Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 3:16-CV-2000, \n2017 WL 34700, at *11 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2017) (Hepatitis C Protocol results in a “conscious \ndisregard of a known risk that inmates . . . will suffer from Hepatitis C related complications”).  \nDr. Trooskin’s expert report provides a strong evidentiary basis for this conclusion: \nThe Chronic Care Clinic policies (Sections G, H, and I) reflect the \ncurrent DOC rationing and prioritization process.  In my opinion, \nthere are serious medical flaws in both the diagnostic and treatment \nregimens.  First, as explained above, there is no medical \njustification for prioritization.  Second, even if priorities were \nacceptable, F-score is based primarily on the APRI calculation and \nvery few inmates are provided a FibroScan.  Thus, the initial \ndetermination of the fibrosis-score is highly unreliable. \n \nThird, even where all diagnoses point to cirrhosis or advanced \nfibrosis, there is no provision that mandates DAA treatment; \nrather, other evaluations are required (see Section H which \nrecognizes the benefit of universal treatment, but then prioritizes \nDAA treatment according to APRI scores and some elastography \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 32 of 43\n \ntesting).  Approximately 5% of all inmates with HCV have been \nprovided with DAA treatment under the Protocol.  For almost all \ninmates with HCV, there is no treatment.  Thus, there are \nthousands of patients with a serious medical condition that will \nworsen over time and who have already manifested symptoms, \nwho are denied a medical treatment that would fully cure them of \nthis illness.  Indeed, the complicated and costly, but ultimately \nreliable diagnostic and treatment standards in sections G and H \nwould be entirely unnecessary with universal treatment.   \n \nTrooskin Rep., Ex. A, 9. \n \n  Defendants’ argument that financial costs are a permissible factor in determining the \ntype of treatment to be offered, see D. Mem. at 19-20, repeats the argument made on the motion \nto dismiss where this Court ruled that allegations that DAA treatment is rationed “based solely \non cost, even though there is no other recommended medical treatment for Chronic Hepatitis C, \ndisregards an excessive risk to the health of infected inmates and thus constitutes deliberate \nindifference to a serious medical need.”  Chimenti, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124892 at *22-23, \nciting Allah v. Thomas, 679 F. App’x 216, 220 (3d Cir. 2017).   \nOn summary judgment, there is substantial evidence that costs are not a defense to the \ndenial of DAA treatment.  First, the defendants have presented evidence that strongly \ncontradicts their argument that financial costs are the reason for the refusal to treat all Chronic \nHepatitis C inmates with DAAs.  For example, Christopher Oppman, the Deputy Secretary for \nAdministration at the DOC who is in charge of financial and other major administrative matters \ninvolving delivery of health services to inmates, testified that the Hepatitis C treatment budget is \nnot based on financial costs, but rather on administrative factors such as the number of inmates \nwho could be treated on a yearly basis:  \nQ.  So let me ask you this.  We’ve been told in other depositions \nthat the population of the DOC with chronic Hepatitis C is \napproximately 6500 or so and that currently some - - \naccording to Dr. Cowan this morning currently about 200 \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 33 of 43\n \ninmates are being treated with DAAs.  I think that Dr. Noel \nsaid it was a little bit higher than that but regardless of that \nnumber of 200 or 300, whatever it might be, if the medical \npeople had said we ought to be treating 2000, not 200, \nwould the DOC then provide the money for all those 2000 \nbased on your answer here? \n \nA.  I would – I would say yes, if they come to us and say this is \nthe patient caseload we need to treat, logistically we are able \nto do this and it’s not beyond the capabilities, that the DOC \nwould request funding from the Governor’s office and from \nthe Senate and House to try to obtain that funding to treat.  \nWhatever is medically necessary we would attempt to do. \n \nQ.  So in your view, the cost is not the factor.  The limiting \nfactor is the number of treatments that are to [sic] or can be \ntreated in the fiscal year? \n \nA.  Yes. \n \nQ.  And that refers to the issues you talked about, security, \ntransportation, administration, and so on and so forth? \n \nA.  Correct sir. \n \nOppman Dep., Ex. N, 25-27 (emphasis added).14 \n  Dr. Noel similarly asserted that administrative and security considerations were the \nmajor barriers to universal treatment with DAAs.  Noel Dep., Ex. H, 21-22.  However, the \ndefendants have wisely not made any such argument in support of their motion for summary \njudgment, as the record definitively rebuts this position.  First, there is conclusive evidence that \n“administrative” factors were never even considered in the two-year process leading to the \nadoption of the current protocol.  Defendants provided to plaintiffs all DOC emails over the \nthree-year period leading up to the adoption of the Hepatitis C Protocol and not a single one of \n                                                 \n14 See also Exhibit O, Oppman Responses to Interrogatories, No. 19 (DOC Hepatitis C budget “is \nnot based on cost of DAAs, but on estimate of the number of inmates that are to [sic] or can be \ntreated in the fiscal year”). \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 34 of 43\n \nthese hundreds of emails references any administrative or security concern in the discussions of \ntreatment protocols.  See Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 23-41.  And, in follow-up discovery, the DOC \ndefendants were unable to provide even a single document that referenced any such concerns.  \nEx. M.     \nSecond, given the screening and monitoring by the DOC of Chronic Hepatitis C inmates, \nthe medical information that is relevant to the DAA prescription process is already recorded.  \nThus, the factors cited by Dr. Noel, Dr. Cowan, Dr. Kendig, and Mr. Oppman on the supposed \nadministrative barriers (e.g., the need for medical examinations, transportation of inmates for \nmedical reviews, assessments by hepatologists, a need for elastography testing) are either \naccounted for or are not applicable in a regime of universal treatment.  All of the information \nrelevant to the proper DAA and any possible contra-indicators to DAA treatment is part of the \nmedical spreadsheet for every inmate and, therefore, especially at the F-0, F-1 and F-2 stages, \nthe DAAs can be prescribed without further examinations or extensive work-up of patients, a \nfact that defendants have conceded.  See, e.g., Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 23-42; 60-61 (conceding that \nadministrative steps such as transfer of inmates for medical testing; further medical workups to \ndetermine which DAA was appropriate; elastography testing and other measures that were \nnecessary before the DAA could be prescribed were not necessary in a system of universal \ntreatment, given the data available to medical staff due to screening and monitoring of inmates \nwith Chronic Hepatitis C); Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 125-131 (same; with special reference to \ninmates at F-1 and F-0 whose conditions would rarely need special medical attention with \nrespect to possible contra-indications to DAA treatment).   \nNor are there any administrative barriers once the DAA is prescribed.  At that point, \nlarge numbers of inmates can easily be treated with once-daily medication, no different than the \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 35 of 43\n \nthousands of inmates in the DOC who are currently being treated with medication at their \nrespective institutions on a daily basis.  Dr. Trooskin testified that given the screening and \nmonitoring that the DOC provides for this class of patients, universal treatment could be \nprovided for the entire class within a 12-18 month period.  See Trooskin Dep., Ex. J, 65. \n  Moreover, notwithstanding this Court’s observation in its Opinion on the motion to \ndismiss that there were no allegations or other information before it as to the cost of DAA \ntreatment, Chimenti¸ 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124892, at*29 n.3, the defendants fail to provide \nthe Court with any up-to-date or reliable data on costs, and the defendants’ Memorandum of \nLaw is silent on this critical question.  There are references to the reduction in costs for DAA \ntreatment from approximately $100,000 per individual regimen when this case was filed, to less \nthan $50,000 as of early 2017.  See Exs. B, D.  But the defendants fail to cite, much less discuss, \nthe most recent relevant development on this issue: in August 2017, the FDA gave approval for \nthe use of the drug Mavyret, produced by the company AbbVie, which for the now-reduced \neight-week regimen is list-priced at $26,400 and which is likely to drive down the costs of \nDAAs even further given the competition among the pharmaceutical companies that \nmanufacture DAAs.  See supra, 6 n. 4.  Defendants’ expert witness, Dr. Kendig, correctly \ndescribed this development as a “game changer” in terms of access to DAA medication for \ninmates and for greatly expanding the number who could be treated by prison systems.  See \nKendig Dep., Ex. K, 138 (emphasis added).   \n  The defendants have failed to provide any cost/benefit analysis in terms of financial \ncosts and have not considered cost-saving factors in universal treatment, including (1) the end of \na system of monitoring and yearly (or more frequent) examinations and tests for the more than \n5,000 inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C who are currently not being treated with DAA, (2) the \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 36 of 43\n \nreduction in the incidence in the spread of Hepatitis C in the prison system, and (3) the \nreduction in treatment costs for hepatic and extra-hepatic conditions of the thousands of inmates \ncurrently infected but not provided DAA treatment.  Dr. Kendig recognized the significance of \nthis factor, stating that the assessment of the actual financial costs of prioritization (as opposed \nto universal treatment) involves “an extremely complicated calculation.”  Kendig Dep., Ex. K, \n137.  Moreover, Dr. Kendig conceded that there “can be significant cost benefits to treatment.” \nId. at 137-138.  The DOC has failed to conduct any such assessment or calculation and, \ntherefore, defendants cannot seek summary judgment without the basic facts necessary to \nengage in a proper Eighth Amendment analysis. \n  Each of the arguments made by the DOC regarding plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim \nis legally and/or factually flawed.  The record in this case fully supports plaintiffs’ federal \nconstitutional claims. \nC.  Plaintiffs State a Claim for Injunctive Relief Under the Pennsylvania                                  \nConstitution \n \nIn the face of two prior rulings of this Court that plaintiffs state a claim for relief in Count \nII of the Amended Complaint (see Chimenti v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civil Action No. 15-3333, \n2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36682, *22 (E.D. Pa. March 21, 2016); Chimenti, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n124892, at*12-13), defendants argue that this claim is “barred by sovereign immunity.”  D. \nMem. at 21.  The Third Circuit has expressly rejected this argument in Pocono Mountain \nCharter Sch. v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., 442 F. App’x 681, 688 (3d Cir. 2011): \nAlthough monetary relief is barred for claims under the Pennsylvania \nConstitution, equitable remedies are available.  See Moeller v. Bradford \nCounty, 444 F. Supp. 2d 316, 320-21 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (“[I]t is well settled \nthat individual plaintiffs may bring suit for injunctive relief under the \nPennsylvania Constitution”); Jones [v. City of Phila., 890 A.2d 1188, 1216 \n(Pa. Commw. Ct. 2006)] (“[Other remedies, such as declaratory or \ninjunctive relief . . . are . . . remedies under the Pennsylvania \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 37 of 43\n \nConstitution.”).  On remand, the District Court must consider whether \nplaintiffs have stated a valid claim for injunctive relief under Article I, § 3 \nor Article I, § 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution (Footnotes omitted). \n \nAccordingly, the motion for summary judgment on this ground should be denied. \nD.    Plaintiff Chimenti’s Individual Claim For Damages Should Proceed. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff Chimenti’s claim for individual damages should be \ndismissed because he is unable to sufficiently prove causation on his claim for negligence.15  D. \nMem. At 22-23.  Plaintiff Chimenti brings a medical malpractice claim (and Eighth Amendment \nclaim) alleging that he sought the DAA treating starting at the end of 2013, through requests to \nhis medical doctor and through the grievance process, but faced a substantial delay of almost two \nyears before receiving the DAA treatment.  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress notes dated \n12/13/13; Progress notes dated 1/22/14; Chimenti grievance dated May 16, 2014, Ex. U.   \nDefendants refused to provide this treatment, first, because they had no Hepatitis C \ntreatment protocol in place, and then because he did not fit into the criteria of the interim \nprotocol, which at that time required the presence of esophageal varices (among other things) \neven though Chimenti was at stage 4 cirrhosis at that time.  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, \nProgress Notes dated 5/27/14.; see also Progress Notes dated 9/30/14 (“I explained again \nhowever that treatments are officially on hold in PA DOC for Hep C.”); Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. \nS, Consultation Record dated 6/27/14 and 6/2/14 (“[B]ecause the DOC policy on Hep C \ntreatments has not yet been completed any recommendations by a hepatologist would be moot \n                                                 \n15 The class seeks injunctive relief only.  There is one claim for individual damages brought by \nSalvatore Chimenti under the Eighth Amendment and for medical malpractice (negligence).  \nWith respect to the DOC Defendants, both Wetzel and Noel are defendants for the Eighth \nAmendment claim, and only Noel is a Defendant under the medical malpractice claim.  The \nCorrect Care Solutions/Wexford Defendants did not file a motion for summary judgment. \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 38 of 43\n \ntill policies in DOC is finalized.  Therefore collegial denied consult [with hepatologist] at this \ntime.”). Noel email re Chimenti dated 12/28/14, Ex. T.  \nThe DOC was aware of his condition and that he was at stage 4 cirrhosis.  See Interim \nHepatitis C Protocol, Ex. P; Chimenti medical records, Ex. S; Chimenti grievances, Ex. U.  \nDuring this time, Chimenti developed a mass in his liver.  Chimenti Dep., Ex. R, 39.  Dr. \nKephart and Dr. Frommer (who are CCS employees and have not filed a motion for summary \njudgment) failed to refer him to a hepatologist, and Dr. Frommer insisted that Chimenti undergo \na biopsy before authorizing further treatment, a procedure that three doctors on three separate \noccasions deemed  too dangerous or difficult to be performed.  See Chimenti Dep. Ex. R, 47; \nChimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress Notes dated 10/20/15 (“liver biopsy is risky”).16 \nDuring this time period, Dr. Noel was responsible for the treatment protocol and the \ndecision of the DOC to cease all treatment while there was no treatment protocol.  He was \nconsulted and involved in the decisionmaking not to provide DAA treatment to Chimenti, \nincluding through email communications with medical personnel, he had the final authority to \ndetermine whether a particular individual received DAA treatment, and medical records indicate \nthat medical staff consulted him on DAA treatment for Chimenti.  See Noel Dep., Ex. H at 173, \n177, 187.17  Dr. Noel had a key role in the significant delay in Chimenti receiving the necessary \ntreatment for his Hepatitis C. \n                                                 \n16 See also UPMC Altoona Final Report by Dr. James, 1/14/15 (“Liver lesion which could be an \nhemangioma and is difficult to biopsy safely given this possibility.”); UPMC – Presbyterian \nFinal Report by Dr. Borhani, dated 2/18/16 (The decision to cancel the ultrasound-guided biopsy \nwas discussed with Dr. Rabinovitz.”); UPMC Altoona Final Report by Dr. Shivers, 3/23/16 \n(“Biopsy of the abnormality was canceled [sic].”) \n17 See also Noel email re Chimenti dated 12/28/14, Ex. T; see also Chimenti Med. Rec., Progress \nNotes dated 9/30/14 (“I discussed [with] [Chimenti] my attempt to get him to see a hepatologist \n& previous email to Dr. Noel.”); Progress Notes dated 12/19/14 (“Received email from Dr. Noel \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 39 of 43\n \nChimenti’s condition worsened due to the substantial delay in treatment, and he \ndeveloped a liver mass as well as diabetes, neither of which he had prior to 2013.  His physical \ncondition also worsened, with increased cognitive problems, memory loss, and pain.  Defendants \nargue that plaintiff Chimenti’s expert report is insufficient to establish that Defendants’ failure to \nfollow the standard of care caused injury to Chimenti.18  Testimony by experts may be used to \n“assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.”  Fed. R. Evd. \n702; see also Donlin v. Philips Lighting N. Am. Corp., 581 F.3d 73, 81 (3d Cir. 2009).  The \nexpert in a medical malpractice case should offer an opinion that the “conduct breached the \nstandard of care . . . and increased the risk of harm to [plaintiff].”19  Carrozza v. Greenbaum, 866 \nA.2d 369, 380 (Pa. Super. 2004).  Further, contrary to what defendants argue, a plaintiff is not \nrequired to prove that defendants were the “but for” cause of his injuries, but only needs to \nestablish that the conduct increased the risk of harm, and that ultimately the issue of causation is \nleft for the factfinder.  Id.  \nIn this case, plaintiff’s expert report by Dr. Cecil is sufficient to establish causation.  Dr. \nCecil wrote that his opinions were with a “reasonable degree of medical certainty,” he had been \ntreating patients with Hepatitis C for more than 20 years, and that for the past 19 years, 95% of \nhis practice has been treatment of Hepatitis C.  See Dr. Cecil report, Ex. Q.  Dr. Cecil explained \nin his report that the standard of care was that that Chimenti be provided DAA treatment (at that \n                                                 \nexplaining CCS policy for Hep C treatment being reviewed & to let Mr. Chimenti know he will \nhave an answer to him shortly.”). \n18 The DOC defendants do not present an argument that Chimenti’s medical care (or lack of) met \nthe standards of care. \n19 Defendant cites a string of cases holding to the previous standard on causation. (See D. Mem. \n23).  In 1981, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted the relaxed ‘increased-risk-of-harm’ \nstandard for medical malpractice cases.  Carrozza, 866 A.2d at 380 (citing Jones v. Montefiore \nHospital, 431 A.2d 920, 923 (Pa. 1981); Hamil v. Bashline, 392 A.2d 1280 (1978)). \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 40 of 43\n \ntime Sovaldi, peginterferon, and ribavirin).  See id. Further, Dr. Cecil stated that Chimenti should \nhave been referred to a liver cancer specialist once the mass was found and not a general \noncologist.  In any event he should not have been denied care due to the lack of a liver biopsy, as \nthat would cause great risk of harm.  See id.  Dr. Cecil opined that Chimenti had cirrhosis that \nwas life-threatening, and that the lack of treatment did injure Chimenti and increased his risk of \ndeath, liver cancer, worsening of liver failure, and increased the need for a liver transplant. See \nid.  Dr. Cecil also explained that the two year delay irreparably worsened Chimenti’s condition, \nand that Chimenti now has diabetes likely related to his Hepatitis C, along with severe fatigue, \nand memory problems related to hepatic encephalopathy.  See id.  On a motion for summary \njudgment, this is sufficient to establish causation. \nThe DOC Defendants have not presented any expert opinion that the delay did not cause \nthe injuries to Chimenti.  To the contrary, Dr. Noel stated with regard to DAA treatment and Mr. \nChimenti’s symptoms, that “had the virus [had] been removed from his body, there’s a chance \nthat those symptoms would have been alleviated.”  Noel Dep., Ex. H, at 186.  Dr. Kendig also \nstated in his deposition that “treating F-3 and F-4 is medically necessary” and that he advised to \ntreat the F-3s and F-4s “as quickly as possible.”  Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 72:2-20.  Dr. Kendig \nfurther testified that the progression to “cirrhosis is high for F-3 to F-4,” and that the fibrosis \nscore strongly predicts the risk of future life-threatening liver disease related to chronic Hepatitis \nC infection. Id. at 74:5-7; 84:3-10; see also id. at 38-40 (citing fatigue as an extrahepatic \ncondition, and that there is an association of Hepatitis C with diabetes). \nChimenti has sufficiently presented evidence that the delay authorized by defendants \ncaused further injury, and therefore summary judgment should be denied. \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101   Filed 11/02/17   Page 41 of 43\n \nV.

Admitted.   \n2.  Admitted.   \n3.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that advances in medical for the \ntreatment of Hepatitis C exist, but it is denied that this is the sole basis for this civil action. \n4.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that Plaintiffs allege that DOC \nDefendants refuse to provide necessary medical treatment for their Hepatitis C by denying them \nthe latest FDA approved direct acting anti-viral drugs (DAADs), but while the denial of DAADs \nis the primary focus of the case, it is denied that this is the sole allegation in how Defendants \nrefuse to provide necessary medical treatment for Hepatitis C. \n                                                 \n1 DOC Defendants’ did not confer with Plaintiffs on the material facts to determine if there could \nbe any stipulations on materials facts, as required by Judge Padova’s Policies and Procedures.  \nThis has led to the inclusion by Defendants of numerous contested facts.   \n1 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 2 of 30\n5.  Admitted in part.  For further clarification, Plaintiffs request class certification for \nindividuals incarcerated in a Pennsylvania Department Corrections facility “who have at least \ntwelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their sentences . . . .”  See Docket No. 94-1 (P \nMem. In Support of Renewed Motion for Class Cert.) at 8. \n6.  Admitted. \n7.  Admitted. \n8.  Admitted. \n9.  Admitted. \n10.  Admitted. \n11.  Admitted. \n12.  Admitted in part, denied in part.2  It is admitted that the DOC has an inmate \ngrievance system policy, DC-ADM 804, that provides an administrative procedure where \ninmates can seek resolution of problems, and admits that inmates can request compensation and \nother legal relief, but to the extent that it may be implied, it is denied that compensation is \nregularly available as an actual form of relief.  It is further denied that the grievance system \nthrough DC-ADM 804 is the sole method for inmates to seek resolution of issues or for fulfilling \nexhaustion requirements pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). \n13.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that this is the process provided by \nDC-ADM 804.  It is denied that this is the sole method for inmates to seek resolution of issues or \nfor filling exhaustion requirements pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). \n                                                 \n2 As set forth in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Summary \nJudgment, all allegations regarding failure to exhaust administrative remedies are irrelevant. \n2 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 3 of 30\n14.  Admitted.  By way of further response, if a grievance is rejected, an inmate has \nonly five (5) working days to re-file the grievance.  See D. Motion for Summary Judgment Appx. \n(“D. Appx.) A at p.1-4. \n15.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  The purpose of the implementation of DC-ADM \n804 is unknown to plaintiffs, nor are the reasons articulated in paragraph 15 written in DC-ADM \n804 as stated, see D Appx. A, and it is only admitted that this is the statement made by Keri \nMoore in her Declaration.  See D. Appx. E at p.2 ¶5.  It is specifically denied that “An inmate \nmust file complaints and appeals in the place and at the time, the prison’s administrative rules \nrequire” as it is a legal conclusion. \n16.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the Inmate Handbook includes \na section regarding the grievance policy, but it is denied that the Inmate Handbook provides \ncomplete information regarding the Grievance Policy requirements and instead, refers inmates to \nDC-ADM 804.  See DOC Inmate Handbook, 2017 edition, Ex. X (excerpt), complete handbook \navailable at \nhttp://www.cor.pa.gov/About%20Us/Documents/DOC%20Policies/2017%20DOC%20Inmate%\n20Handbook.pdf. \n17.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the Declaration of Keri Moore \nstates that when a grievance or appeal is received from an inmate, staff put certain information \ninto a Central Grievance Tracking System, but it is specifically denied that the Central Grievance \nTracking System is a complete record of all grievances filed. \n18.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n3 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 4 of 30\n19.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n20.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n21.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n22.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n23.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n24.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n25.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the Declaration of Keri \nMoore makes this statement. \n26.  Admitted in part, denied it part.  It is admitted that many inmates’ grievances \nrelating to Hepatitis C treatment are referred to the Bureau of Health Care Services (BHCS), but \nPlaintiffs do not have further knowledge on whether all of these grievances are referred to the \nBHCS. \n27.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that Keri Moore and Richard \nWenhold state this in their Declarations, but it is denied that the tracking is complete or accurate.  \nFor example, Inmate No. JZ-3979 is named Plaintiff Daniel Leyva, who filed his first grievance \non January 13, 2015 (Grievance No. 546641), which is not listed in the excel spreadsheet.  \nCompare P Ex. U and D. Appx. B.  Plaintiff Leyva filed a follow-up grievance on April 7, 2015 \n4 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 5 of 30\n(Grievance No. 561975), which is also not listed in the excel spreadsheet, even though \nDefendants themselves produced this document in discovery and have attached it as an exhibit to \ntheir brief. Compare D. Appx. B and C.   \n28.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the information about \ngrievances is kept on an excel spreadsheet, but denied that the information contained is complete \nor accurate. \n29.  Admitted. \n30.  Neither admitted nor denied.  Plaintiffs have no additional information on this \nmatter, aside from Richard Wenhold’s Declaration. \n31.  Denied.  Plaintiff Leyva filed his first grievance regarding Hepatitis C treatment \non January 13, 2015.  The grievance filed on April 27, 2015 was a follow-up grievance to the \none filed in January 13, 2015.  See P. Ex. U (Leyva Grievance dated 1/13/15). \n32.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that a final decision for Grievance \nNo. 561975 for Plaintiff Leyva was issued on September 8, 2015.  However, he received a final \nresponse to Grievance No. 546641, his first grievance seeking Hepatitis C treatment, on January \n13, 2015, where his grievance was upheld (and therefore there is no obligation to appeal when \nthe inmate is upheld). Plaintiff Leyva then received a letter from BCHS on March 13, 2016.  See \nLeyva grievances, Ex. U. \n33.  Denied.  As discussed above in paragraph 27, the excel spreadsheet is incomplete \nand inaccurate. \n34.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that these inmate numbers are \nlisted in the excel spreadsheet. \n5 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 6 of 30\n35.  Denied.  It is specifically denied that AY-3342 filed duplicative grievances.  \nInmate No. AY-3342 is named Plaintiff Chimenti, and while they relate to Hepatitis C treatment, \nthey are not duplicative.  In fact, the grievance system can (and frequently does) reject \nduplicative grievances. \n36.  Denied as this is a legal conclusion. \n37.  Denied as this is a legal conclusion. \n38.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the documents show a \n“Completion Date” of after June, 2015, but contains no further information or content for the \nfirst three, and only portions of a response for the last two. \n39.  Denied.  As discussed above in paragraph 27, the excel spreadsheet is incomplete \nand inaccurate, and therefore this conclusion is likely incomplete and inaccurate. \n40.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the most recent Hepatitis C \nprotocol was issued and made effective on November 7, 2016, but it is denied that DOC treats all \ninmates on an individual basis with chronic Hepatitis C in accordance with its Hepatitis C \nprotocol. \n41.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the DOC screens all inmates \nfor Hepatitis C, and does keep track of those inmates, and sends them to a chronic care clinic.  \nPlaintiffs deny that the DOC educates inmates regarding the policy, except when inmates make \ninquiries while seeking medical treatment or file a grievance. \n42.  Denied.  Inmates with chronic Hepatitis C are reviewed, but Plaintiffs assert that \nthe DOC is rationing DAAD treatment. \n43.  Denied. \n44.  Denied. \n6 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 7 of 30\n45.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the Hepatitis C Review \nCommittee developed the Hepatitis C protocol.  It is denied that the DOC protocol is the same as \nthe federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) protocol as there are differences.  See Noel Dep. Tr. Ex. H, \n82:11-15.  It is also denied that the DOC protocol prioritizes treatment.  \n46.  Admitted. \n47.  Admitted.  By way of further explanation, Dr. Noel has the “ultimate \nresponsibility” on the Hepatitis C Review Committee to approve treatment.  See Noel Dep. Tr. \nEx. H, 156:12-19. \n48.  Admitted, except that the company is called “Correct Care Solutions,” not \n“Correction Care Solutions.”  To further clarify, Correct Care solutions currently holds the \ncontract to provide medical services, but previously the medical services were contracted with \nWexford Health Services.  See Noel Dep. Tr. at 8:6-8; 175:5-13. \n49.  Admitted. \n50.  Admitted. \n51.  Admitted. \n52.  Admitted. \n53.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the DOC began treating some \ninmates when it issued its Interim Hepatitis C Protocol, but it is denied that the DOC initially \nstarted treating people based on fibrosis score.  Rather, the DOC imposed additional criteria such \nthat even individuals with F-4 fibrosis score did not receive the treatment, such as Plaintiff \nChimenti.  See Interim Protocol, Ex. P. \n7 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 8 of 30\n54.  Neither admitted nor denied.  The DOC has informed Plaintiffs that it intends to \nstart approving and treating individuals with an F-2 fibrosis score, but has not provided \ndocumentation of this plan. \n55.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that this is what the DOC \nrepresents that it will do, but some inmates have complained that periodic testing is untimely. \n56.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  While the DOC has stated they plan on treating \nother inmates with lower fibrosis scores, it is denied that this has or will happen.  To date, no \ndefinitive plan or time frames have been presented.   \n57.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  While the DOC has stated they plan on treating \nother inmates with lower fibrosis scores, it is denied that this has or will happen.  To date, no \ndefinitive plan or time frames have been presented. \n58.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  While treating inmates with Hepatitis C may \nrequire some more work than writing a prescription, it is not unlike prescribing treatment of \nother medical conditions, and treatment of Hepatitis C is now based on an algorithm and is fairly \nstraightforward.  See Trooskin Dep. Ex. J, 63:7-64:2. \n59.  Admitted. \n60.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  For further clarification, it is admitted that Dr. \nCowan reviews the information for each patient (not necessarily the whole medical file), then \nconsiders other factors such as whether additional tests or a vaccine is needed.  See Cowan Dep. \nEx. D, 36:13-38:19. \n61.  Denied. \n62.  Denied.   \n63.  Admitted. \n8 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 9 of 30\n64.  Admitted. \n65.  Admitted. \n66.  Admitted. \n67.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the exact number does change, \nbut Plaintiffs are unaware of any large fluctuations in numbers. \n68.  Admitted. \n69.  Admitted. \n70.  Admitted. \n71.  Admitted. \n72.  Admitted. \n73.  Admitted. \n74.  Admitted. \n75.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  There is some correlation of the APRI score to \nfibrosis, but it is an indirect marker.  In certain ranges, the correlation between APRI score and \nfibrosis level can be significantly inaccurate, in the range of 48 percent.  See Cowan Dep. Tr. \n42:5-43:7. \n76.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that there is some correlation as \nsuggested, but this correlation is imprecise.  See P. Br. at Part IV.B.2. \n77.  It is admitted that there is some correlation as suggested, but this correlation is \nimprecise.  See P. Br. at Part IV.B.2. \n78.  It is admitted that there is some correlation as suggested, but this correlation is \nimprecise.  See P. Br. at Part IV.B.2. \n9 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 10 of 30\n79.  It is admitted that there is some correlation as suggested, but this correlation is \nimprecise.  See P. Br. at Part IV.B.2. \n80.  Admitted. \n81.  Admitted. \n82.  Admitted. \n83.  Admitted. \n84.  Admitted. \n85.  Admitted. \n86.  Admitted. \n87.  Denied.  It is denied that these numbers are accurate due to the insensitivity of the \nAPRI score.  See P. Br. at Part IV.B.2. \n88.  Admitted. \n89.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is denied that this is an accurate number of the \nindividuals who have exhausted the administrative grievance system.  It is admitted that these are \nthe APRI scores calculated for these individuals.  Furthermore, for the inmate that allegedly \nrefused a blood test, the DOC has the results from prior blood tests that indicate an APRI score \nof 0.5-1.0. \n90.  Denied. \n91.  Admitted. \n92.  Denied.  The DOC has provided previous lab test results through discovery for \nthis individual that also provide an APRI score. \n93.  Denied. \n94.  Denied. \n10 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 11 of 30\n95.  Denied. \n96.  Denied.  Plaintiffs do not know what a “self-funded entity” is. \n97.  Denied. \n98.  Denied.  By way of further response, Plaintiffs are not alleging a lack of screening \nor testing for Hepatitis C. \n99.  Admitted. \n100.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that the DAADs currently cost \napproximately $30,000 to $45,000 per individual treatment regime as of July 2017.  Plaintiffs \ndeny that the total cost in one fiscal year would amount to $150 million, which presumably is the \ntotal cost if the DOC treated 5000 inmates in one year, because the DOC deliberately withholds \ntreatment from inmates with chronic Hepatitis C, and has not spent this amount in the prior \nyear(s).  Furthermore, with the advent of a new DAAD that is priced significantly lower than \nprevious treatments, this total amount may be less.  See Kendig Dep., Ex. K, at 138; see also P. \nBr. at footnote 4 for further information.  \n101.  Admitted.   \n102.  Admitted. \n103.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that Mr. Oppman stated this in his \ndeposition, but Defendants have not provided documents or testimony that demonstrate this fact. \n104.  Denied. \n105.  Admitted. \n106.  Admitted. \n107.  Admitted. \n108.  Admitted. \n11 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 12 of 30\n109.  Admitted. \n110.  Admitted. \n111.  Denied. \n112.  Denied. \n113.  Denied. \n114.  Denied. \n115.  Denied.  Further, this includes a legal conclusion not applicable for a statement of \nfacts. \n116.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted that F-0 indicates less or limited \nfibrosis but denies that this means an individual has a healthy liver.  Furthermore, a person may \nexperience or suffer from extrahepatic symptoms even at lower fibrosis levels.  See Trooskin \nDep. Ex. J, 83-84. \n117.  Admitted.   \n118.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that F-2 indicates an \nintermediate level of fibrosis.  See Trooskin Rep. Ex. A at 2. \n119.  Denied.   \n120.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  See Trooskin Dep. Ex. J,  \n121.  Admitted.  By way of further response, this is similar to the process in prescribing \nany medication.  See Trooskin Dep. Ex. J, 63:10-20. \n122.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that Dr. Kendig stated this in \nhis report for Defendants, but denies that the fiscal challenge of treating all inmates with DAADs \nis “unlike any other challenge presented previously in correctional medicine.” \n12 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 13 of 30\n123.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that Dr. Kendig made a \nstatement similar to this in his deposition. \n124.  Denied.  Dr. Kendig testified that for individuals at F-0 and F-1, the BOP (United \nStates) deferred treatment of interferon for DAADs, and admitted that a different balance existed \ndue to the side effects associated with interferon.  See Kendig Dep. Ex. K, 99:1-22. \n125.  Admitted.  By way of further response, Dr. Kendig also did not review any \nmedical records.  See Kendig Report, Ex. B at 4. \n126.  Admitted. \n127.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  Dr. Trooskin receives a grant from Gilead that \nlinks people with Hepatitis C to overcome barriers to get medical care, not just DAADs, \nspecifically those with barriers to care such as lack of insurance, homelessness, and mental \nhealth issues, and more simple things such as the ability to travel to an appointment.  See Dr. \nTrooskin Dep. Ex. J, 18:3-20.   \n128.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  Defendants’ statement is inaccurate.  Dr. \nTrooskin testified she is an advocate for people with Hepatitis C, and that she follows the \nAASLD/IDSA guidelines, which recommends that everybody be treated for Hepatitis C.  See \nTrooskin Dep. Ex. J, 21:7-14. \n129.  Denied.  Furthermore, this is a credibility determination inappropriate for a \nStatement of Facts. \n130.  Admitted. \n131.  Denied.  This is a misstatement of Dr. Trooskin’s testimony.  Dr. Trooskin \ntestified that the risks and benefits had to be weighed with prescribing prior medications \n(interferon-based therapy) which had side effects, possible contraindications, and a lower cure \n13 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 14 of 30\nrate with a possible new treatment that would cause less harm to patients.  See Dr. Trooskin Dep. \nEx. J, 87:25 – 88:22. \n132.  Denied.  Furthermore, this is a credibility determination inappropriate for a \nStatement of Facts. \n133.  Denied.  This is a misstatement of Dr. Trooskin’s testimony.  Dr. Trooskin \ntestified that she did not review individual medical records of Pennsylvania DOC inmates.  See \nTrooskin Dep. Ex. J. \n134.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  Dr. Trooskin responded “to some extent, yet” \nbut then clarified that the situation has been changing such that starting in January 2018, \nMedicaid will be opening up coverage to individuals at F-0.  See Dr. Trooskin Dep. Ex. J, 27:9 – \n28:25. \n135.  Admitted. \n136.  Admitted.  By way of further response, Dr. Cecil is Plaintiff Chimenti’s expert \nwitness for his individual damage claims only. \n137.  Admitted.  By way of further response, Dr. Cecil’s wrote, “Harvoni cured his \nHCV two years late and the delay irreparately worsened Mr. Chimenti.”  See Cecil Report Ex. Q \nat 1. \n138.  Admitted. \n139.

The AASLD guidelines note that there may be \nsettings where there are factors that limit access to medications and the ability to deliver them to \npatients may consider which patients should be treated first.  See AASLD guidelines Ex. C. \n144.  Admitted. \n145.  Admitted.  By way of further response, the Department of Veterans Affairs also \nnotes that the natural history of HCV is variable.  See D. Appx. Y at 46. \n146.  Denied.  Currently all veterans with Hepatitis C in the care of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs are eligible for treatment regardless of the stage of the patients’ liver disease.  \nSee Department of Veterans Affairs New Release, VA Expands Hepatitis C Drug Treatment, \ndated March 9, 2016, available at https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2762; \nVA Fact Sheet, September 2017, available at https://www.hepatitis.va.gov/pdf/VA-HCV-Fact-\nSheet.pdf. \n147.

Hepatitis C can significantly impair the liver’s ability to assist the body in \ndigesting essential nutrients, filtering toxins from the blood, and preventing disease.  Am. \nCompl. at ¶ 17. \n15 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 16 of 30\n151.  An acute infection occurs within the first six months of exposure to the virus and, \nfor most of those infected, leads to chronic Hepatitis C infection.  Id.   \n152.  Hepatitis C infections are spread by transmitting blood from a person infected \nwith Hepatitis C to another person.  See Trooskin Rep. Exhibit (Ex.) A at 2.   \n153.  Some of the major means of transmission are the sharing of needles for injecting \ndrugs, tattooing or piercing, being born to a mother with Hepatitis C, transfusion with infected \nblood or blood products, and sexual contact with a person infected with Hepatitis C.  Id.  \n154.  Any delay in treatment or rationing of DAAs for treatment “cannot be justified on \nany medical basis” because each day without treatment increases the risk of transmitting \nHepatitis C to others and increases the likelihood of developing more serious medical problems. \nId. at 4-5. \n155.  Hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis (the irreversible scarring of liver \ntissue that can cause symptoms such as swelling, increased likelihood of bruising, jaundice, \nitching, nausea, and problems with concentration and memory) and liver cancer, making it the \nmost common cause of liver transplants.  Id.   \n156.  Liver transplants are painful, carry a risk of significant complications, and are \nnearly impossible for prisoners to obtain.  Am. Compl. at ¶ 21.   \n157.  Transplants also result in lower recovery rates than treatment with DAA drugs \nand are very costly.  Id.; Mayo Clinic Staff, Hepatitis C Treatment, MAYO CLINIC, \nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/diagnosis-treatment/treatment/txc-\n20207409 (last visited Sep. 25, 2017). \n158.  Chronic Hepatitis C infections can also cause serious chronic liver disease, liver \nfibrosis (the scarring of liver tissue), extrahepatic conditions (such as diabetes, muscle damage, \n16 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 17 of 30\nnerve damage, heart disease, fatigue, depression, nausea, and problems with concentration and \nmemory), and death.  See Trooskin Rep. Ex. A, 2; Trooskin Dep. Ex. J, 83-84. \n159.  More than 20,000 people die each year as a result of Hepatitis C -- more than any \nother infectious disease.  See Trooskin Rep. Ex. A, 2.   \n160.  Beginning in 2011, the FDA approved the use of several “breakthrough therapies” \nin the form of DAA medications that can cure Hepatitis C: Harvoni® (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir), \nOlysio® (simeprevir), Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir), Viekira Pak® (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nplus dasabuvir), Zepatier® (elbasvir/grazoprevir), and Epclusa® (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir).  \nTrooskin Rep., Ex. A, 3.   \n161.  Over 95% of individuals with Hepatitis C treated with Harvoni are now cured of \nthe infection.  Id.  \n162.  Individuals treated with these DAAs suffer no, or minimal, side effects.  Id. \n163.  The leading liver disease and Hepatitis C treatment medical organizations, the \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”) and the Infectious Diseases \nSociety of America (“IDSA”), have recommended that DAAs be used to treat all individuals \nwith chronic Hepatitis C and have specifically confirmed that treatment should not be reserved \nfor individuals with advanced states of the infection.  Trooskin Rep., Ex. A, 3; see When and in \nWhom to Initiate HCV Therapy, AASLD AND IDSA HCV GUIDANCE, \nhttp://www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/when-whom (last updated Sep. 21, 2017), Ex. C. \n164.  Several other institutions have also recommended or instituted this course of \ntreatment, further establishing the use of DAAs as the standard of care for chronic Hepatitis C, \nincluding the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), Medicare, and the Veterans Administration \n(“VA”). Id.  These institutions -- particularly the AASLD, IDSA, CDC, and VA -- are the same \n17 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 18 of 30\ninstitutions the DOC’s medical provider relies on for treatment recommendations.  Cowan Dep. \nEx. D at 16-19, 24-25. \n165.  The FDA has recently approved Mavyret, which is market priced at 40% the price \nof other DAAs.

At the time when plaintiffs filed their Class Action Complaint on June 12, 2015, \nthe Defendants had ceased all medical treatment for Hepatitis C, providing neither the previous \ntriple therapy (boceprevir or telaprevir with interferon) nor DAAs, and had no policy for treating \nany inmate diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C with DAAs.  See Class Action Compl. (Docket \nNo. 1) at 6-11; see also Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S.   \n167.  When inmates complained or filed grievances about Hepatitis C treatment, they \nwere told that the “DOC/BHCS is re-evaluating [their] treatment protocol for Hepatitis C given \nthe new guidance issued by the [AASLD] and the [IDSA].”  See, e.g., Letter to Daniel Leyva \nfrom Christopher Oppman (“Leyva Letter”), Ex. E at 1; Letter to David Maldonado from \nChristopher Oppman (“Maldonado Letter”), Ex. F at 1.   \n168.  On November 20, 2015, the Department of Corrections adopted an interim \nHepatitis C policy.  See Ex. P. \n18 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 19 of 30\n169.  On November 7, 2016, the Department of Corrections adopted a policy for \ntreating patients with chronic Hepatitis C (“Hepatitis C Protocol” or “Protocol”) that applies to \nall inmates diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C.  See “DOC Access to Health Care Procedures \nManual, Section 20 – Hepatitis C Protocol,” (Nov. 7, 2016) (“Hepatitis C Protocol”), Ex. G.   \n170.  This Hepatitis C policy provides the “clinical guidelines for the diagnosis, \nmanagement, and treatment of inmate patients with chronic Hepatitis C.” Id. at 20-1. \n171.  Individuals with chronic Hepatitis C are diagnosed on a fibrosis level scale of F-0 \nto F-4, with the F-4 diagnosis as the most serious stage of the infection.  Am. Compl. ¶ 31; see \nTrooskin Rep. Ex. A at 2. \n172.  Individuals at F-3 and F-4 are considered the sickest of the patients who have \nHepatitis C.  See Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 60. \n173.  Dr. Kendig testified in his deposition that treating individuals at F-3 and F-4 was \n“medically necessary.”  See Kendig Dep. Ex. K, 72 (“I would argue that treating F-3 and F-4 is \nmedically necessary.”) \n174.  Individuals at early stages of Chronic Hepatitis C often suffer from serious \nphysical and mental symptoms, and, without treatment, most of them will progress to high \nfibrosis levels.  Id. at ¶¶ 31-32; see Trooskin Dep. Ex. J, 83-85; Trooskin Rep. Ex. A at 2. \n175.  Pennsylvania DOC inmates at stage F-2 are not currently being treated.  See \nTrooskin Rep., Ex. A, 2; Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 12; Decl. of Richard Wenhold, Ex. I. \n176.  Dr. Kendig could not point to any case file that showed treatment before the \ninmate was at F-3 or F-4. Id. 89-91.   \n177.  Pennsylvania DOC inmates at stages F-0 and F-1 are not currently being treated.  \nId. \n19 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 20 of 30\n178.  Approximately 5% of all inmates with HCV have been provided with DAA \ntreatment under the Protocol.  See Trooskin Rep. Ex. A, 9. \n179.  Inmates at stages F-0, F-1, and F-2 have over a 70% chance of progressing to \nserious fibrosis. \n180.  Inmates at F-0 and F-1 constitute the largest part of the class of the approximate \n5,500 diagnosed inmates.  See Trooskin Rep., Ex. A, 2; Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 12; Decl. of Richard \nWenhold, Ex. I.   \n181.  The DOC relies on the APRI score for determining whether an individual \nqualifies for DAA treatment.  See Noel Dep. Ex. H, 85, 92, 99, 108. \n182.  The APRI score is a calculation of the aspartate aminotransferase and \nplatelet·count.  Cowan Dep. Ex. D, 42:1-3. \n183.  An APRI score between 1.5 and 2 only has a sensitivity accuracy of 48 percent, \nwhere it may miss over half the number of individuals who have cirrhosis.  Cowan Dep. Ex. D, \n42:5-20. \n184.  An APRI score of 1 may miss approximately 23 percent of patients of cirrhosis.  \nCowan Dep. Ex. D, 42:21-43:2. \n185.  Dr. Kendig referenced a study that showed that 48% of patients with APRI scores \nat or above 1.0 were at a significantly higher F score.  See Kendig Dep. Ex. K, 55-56.   \n186.  In the data provided by the DOC, 179 patients were listed without any APRI \nscore.  See Kendig Dep. Ex. K, 71. \n187.  Dr. Kendig stated that any prioritization protocol requires accurate F-scores.  Id. \nat 65. \n20 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 21 of 30\n188.  The DOC does not routinely use more precise tests, including FibroScan, a type \nof ultrasound known as “transient elastography,” that all experts credit as the most reliable \nindicator of fibrosis levels.  See Trooskin Rep., Ex. J, 8; Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 61-62; 66-67.   \n189.  The Hepatitis C Protocol is implemented by the Hepatitis C Treatment \nCommittee, which consists of the DOC Bureau of Health Care Services Chief of Clinical \nServices, the Statewide Medical Director for the medical vendor (currently Correct Care \nSolutions), and the Bureau of Health Care Services Infection Control Coordinator.  See Hepatitis \nC Protocol, Ex. G, 20-10; Noel Dep. Ex. H, 18.   \n190.  The Chief of Clinical Services, currently Dr. Noel, is a final decision-maker in \nauthorizing DAA treatment for any particular inmate.  Noel Dep., Ex. H, 187. \n191.  Dr. Noel consults with the medical contractor’s medical director (then Dr. \nCowan) in determining whether to authorize treatment for a particular inmate.  Id. \n192.  In discussions leading up to the adoption of the protocol, Dr. Scharff, then the \nDOC Chief of Clinical Services, Bureau of Health Care Services, and Eugene Ginchereau, \nAssistant State Medical Director, provided Dr. Noel with suggested guidelines as to which \npatients should be provided DAA treatment.  See Noel Dep. Ex. H, 81-82; see also Noel emails, \nEx. L. \n193.  These guidelines advised that inmates with an APRI score at or greater than 1.0 \nshould be treated.  See Noel Dep. Ex. H, 81-82; see also Noel emails, Ex. L. \n194.  Dr. Noel rejected that standard—not because the medical condition did not \nwarrant DAA treatment—but because it created too large a number of inmates to be treated.  Id.   \n21 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 22 of 30\n195.  On February 18, 2015, Dr. Noel stated in an email that use of elastography \nscience would create “a bucket of potential patients which is too large to treat.”  Noel email, Ex. \nL. \n196.  Elastography is the “gold standard” for determining fibrosis levels.  See Cowan \nDep. Ex. D, 42-43.   \n197.  Christopher Oppman, the Deputy Secretary for Administration at the DOC, is in \ncharge of financial and other major administrative matters involving delivery of health services \nto inmates.  See Oppman Dep. Ex. N, 6-11. \n198.  Oppman testified that the Hepatitis C treatment budget is not based on financial \ncosts, but rather on administrative factors such as the number of inmates who could be treated on \na yearly basis.  Oppman Dep., Ex. N, 25-27; see also Oppman Interrogatories Response, Ex. 0. \n199.  Defendants provided to plaintiffs all DOC emails over the three-year period \nleading up to the adoption of the Hepatitis C Protocol and not a single one of these hundreds of \nemails references any administrative or security concern in the discussions of treatment \nprotocols.  See Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 23-41.   \n200.  In follow-up discovery, the DOC defendants were unable to provide even a single \ndocument that referenced any such concerns.  See P. Request for Prod. Of Doc. and Discovery \nFollow-up Correspondence, Ex. M. \n201.  The DOC compiles a tracking spreadsheet that records medical information that is \nrelevant to the DAA prescription process.  See D. Appx. B. \n202.  Dr. Cowen conceded that administrative steps such as transfer of inmates for \nmedical testing; further medical workups to determine which DAA was appropriate; \nelastography testing and other measures that were necessary before the DAA could be \n22 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 23 of 30\nprescribed; were not necessary in a system of universal treatment, given the data available to \nmedical staff due to screening and monitoring of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C.  See Cowan \nDep., Ex. D, 23-42; 60-61. \n203.  Dr. Kendig noted that inmates at F-1 and F-0 whose conditions would rarely need \nspecial medical attention with respect to possible contra-indications to DAA treatment.  See \nKendig Dep., Ex. K, 125-131. \n204.  Dr. Trooskin testified that given the screening and monitoring that the DOC \nprovides for this class of patients, universal treatment could be provided for the entire class \nwithin a 12-18 month period.  See Trooskin Dep., Ex. J, 65. \n205.  Dr. Kendig stated that the assessment of the actual financial costs of prioritization \n(as opposed to universal treatment) involves “an extremely complicated calculation.”  Kendig \nDep., Ex. K, 137. \n206.  Dr. Kendig conceded that there “can be significant cost benefits to treatment.” Id. \nat 137-138.   \n207.  The current Hepatitis C protocol does not require DAA treatment for any specific \nindividual or even for classes of inmates and the current practice of treating those at F-3 and F-4 \ncould be changed at any time and for any reason.  See Hepatitis C Protocol, Ex. G; Trooskin \nDep. Ex. A, 8-9. \n208.  In responding to grievances filed by each of the named plaintiffs, the DOC \nexplicitly stated that their care was governed by “community standards of care” for this disease.  \nSee Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 19-21; see also Letter to Leyva, Ex. E; Letter to Maldonado, Ex. F.   \n209.  The contracts between the DOC and its medical provider specify community \nstandards of care.  See Noel Dep., Ex. H, 13-16; 19-20.   \n23 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 24 of 30\n210.  Significant numbers of patients at F-0 to F-2 are suffering from serious medical \nsymptoms, both hepatic and extra-hepatic.  Trooskin Rep., Ex. A, 5; See also Trooskin Dep., Ex. \nJ, 47-48. \n211.  HCV is known to have extrahepatic manifestations, described as effects on organ \nsystems outside the liver.  Id. \n212.  Without treatment, individuals may be needlessly exposed to depression, fatigue, \nsore muscles, joint pain, kidney injury, diabetes or glucose intolerance, certain types of rashes or \nautoimmune diseases.  Id. \n213.  Without treatment, individuals with HCV are at increased risk of developing \ncirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure requiring transplant.  Furthermore, once individuals \ndevelop advanced liver disease they must undergo cancer screening at regular intervals for the \nrest of their life even after they are cured of their HCV.  Id. \n214.  Delaying treatment, even for those at F-0 and F-1, has a variety of adverse effects \nincluding increasing the risk of death, causing irreversible liver damage, and needlessly \nprolonging suffering associated with the disease.  Trooskin Rep., Ex. A, 6. \n215.  From a public health perspective, observation without treatment risks spreading \nthe disease to others.  Id.  \n216.  Delaying treatment while that individual’s liver degrades significantly increases \nthe risk of death from cancer, liver failure and a liver transplant.  Id. \n217.  Once a person reaches a fibrosis score of F3 her chance of getting liver cancer is \nso significant that it is recommended that, even after having been cured with a DAA, the \nindividual undergo twice yearly liver imaging surveillance for liver cancer.  Id; see also Kendig \nDep. Ex. K, 143-144. \n24 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 25 of 30\n218.  Delay in treatment can cause damage to other vital organs, and can cause heart \nattacks, fatigue, joint pain, depression, sore muscles, arthritis, and, at times, premature death.  \nId., citing Gill, Ghazinian, Manch Gish, Hepatitis C virus as a systemic disease; reaching beyond \nthe liver, HEPATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL, Vol. 9, No. 4 (2015).   \n219.  Dr. Cowan testified that he had no basis to disagree with any of the reasons \nprovided by the AASLD in its official Guidance for the need for universal treatment, including \nthe presence of symptoms at early stages; the increased effectiveness of DAA treatment at the \nearliest possible point of intervention in the disease cycle; and preventing otherwise significant \nsuffering, preventable cancer, liver failure, and death. See Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 62-63.   \n220.  Dr. Noel also testified that he had no basis to disagree with any of the reasons \nprovided by the AASLD in its official Guidance for the need for universal treatment, including \nthe presence of symptoms at early stages; the increased effectiveness of DAA treatment at the \nearliest possible point of intervention in the disease cycle; and preventing otherwise significant \nsuffering, preventable cancer, liver failure, and death. See Noel Dep., Ex. H, 46-50. \n221.  Dr. Noel, Dr. Cowan and Dr. Kendig have all acknowledged the point made by \nDr. Trooskin that patients at F-0 to F-2 can and do suffer from a range of symptoms caused by \nChronic Hepatitis C.  See, e.g., Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 38-40; 117-119 (significant number of \npatients at F-0 may have extra –hepatic symptoms); Cowan Dep., Ex. D, 49; 51-53; Noel Dep., \nEx. H, 53-59; 125; 142 (severe fatigue can be present at F-1-2). \n222.  Dr. Kendig agreed that research studies showed that 4.7% of patients at F-2, and \n2.3% of patients at F-0 and F-1 would advance to liver failure and/or liver cancer without \ntreatment.  See Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 91-96. \n25 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 26 of 30\n223.  Applying that analysis to the DOC Hepatitis C patient list, approximately 420 \npatients would be in the very high risk category.  See Kendig Dep., Ex. K, 91-96. \n224.  Daniel Leyva’s filed a grievance seeking DAA treatment and it was “upheld.”  \nSee Leyva grievances, Ex. U.   \nSalvatore Chimenti \n225.  Chimenti began requesting DAA treatment in late 2013 with his treating medical \nstaff.  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress notes dated 12/13/13; see also Progress notes \ndated 1/22/14. \n226.  Chimenti filed grievances in early 2014 seeking DAA treatment.  See Chimenti \ngrievance dated May 16, 2014, Ex. U. \n227.  Chimenti initially was denied treatment due to the lack of a Hepatitis C protocol.  \nSee Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress Notes dated 5/27/14. \n228.  Dr. Kephart wrote in Chimenti’s medical records, “Pt again reminded of previous \ntalk for Hep. C treatment of how treatment on hold.”  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress \nNotes dated 5/27/14.; see also Progress Notes dated 9/30/14 (“I explained again however that \ntreatments are officially on hold in PA DOC for Hep C.”). \n229.  In May or June 2014, Chimenti was denied approval for a medical appointment \nwith a gastroenterologist or hepatologist due to all treatment being stopped pending a new \ntreatment protocol.  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Consultation Record dated 6/27/14 and \n6/2/14 (“[B]ecause the DOC policy on Hep C treatments has not yet been completed any \nrecommendations by a hepatologist would be moot till policies in DOC is finalized.  Therefore \ncollegial denied consult [with hepatologist] at this time.”). \n26 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 27 of 30\n230.  Chimenti was later denied due to the alleged lack of esophageal varices, which \nwas required at that time under the Interim Hepatitis C protocol.  See Interim Hepatitis C \nprotocol, Ex. P; Noel email re Chimenti dated 12/28/14, Ex. T. \n231.  Dr. Noel was consulted about Chimenti’s medical treatment, and made decisions \nregarding Chimenti’s medical treatment, including whether or not he should receive DAA \ntreatment.  See Noel email re Chimenti dated 12/28/14, Ex. T; see also Chimenti Med. Rec., \nProgress Notes dated 9/30/14 (“I discussed [with] [Chimenti] my attempt to get him to see a \nhepatologist & previous email to Dr. Noel.”); Progress Notes dated 12/19/14 (“Received email \nfrom Dr. Noel explaining CCS policy for Hep C treatment being reviewed & to let Mr. Chimenti \nknow he will have an answer to him shortly.”). \n232.  In October 2015, Chimenti was informed by Dr. Frommer that he had cancer due \nto a mass being seen on a CT scan.  See Chimenti Dep., Ex. R, 39. \n233.  Chimenti was told multiple times by Dr. Frommer that Chimenti would not \nreceive treatment unless he underwent a biopsy.  See Chimenti Dep. Ex. R, 47. \n234.  Dr. Agra, also a doctor working at Chimenti’s prison, advised Chimenti not to \nundergo the biopsy due to the danger it posed.  See Chimenti Med. Rec. Ex. S, Progress Notes \ndated 10/20/15 (“liver biopsy is risky”); Chimenti Dep., Ex. R, 40. \n235.  Chimenti ultimately consented to a biopsy, but on three separate occasions by \nthree separate radiologists, the biopsy was cancelled due to the inability to conduct the biopsy \nsafely.  See Chimenti Dep., Ex. R, 41-46; UPMC Altoona Final Report by Dr. James, 1/14/15 \n(“Liver lesion which could be an hemangioma and is difficult to biopsy safely given this \npossibility.”); UPMC – Presbyterian Final Report by Dr. Borhani, dated 2/18/16 (The decision to \n27 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-2   Filed 11/02/17   Page 28 of 30\ncancel the ultrasound-guided biopsy was discussed with Dr. Rabinovitz.”); UPMC Altoona Final \nReport by Dr. Shivers, 3/23/16 (“Biopsy of the abnormality was canceled [sic].”).  \n236.  Chimenti ultimately received the DAA treatment in October 2016, about two \nyears after his initial request seeking DAA treatment.  See Chimenti Dep. Ex. R, 34. \n237.  In the meanwhile, Chimenti’s physical condition worsened, including memory \nloss due to hepatic encephalopathy, extreme fatigue, and the onset of diabetes likely connected to \nHepatitis C.  See Dr. Cecil Report, Ex. Q; Chimenti Dep., Ex. R, 33-34. \n238.  Chimenti also has reduced ability to conduct regular daily activities, reports only \nwanting to sleep, being tired and having no energy, having bone and muscle pain, getting rashes, \nand swollen legs.

Right, and in terms of the provision of 6 diseases which include asthma and COPD, seizure\n7 medical services, putting aside Hep C treatment for the 7 disorder, HIV.\n8 moment, for all other treatment that's provided by CCS 8 Q.      Okay.\n9 who develops the protocols, the regulations, the 9 A.      Off the top of my head that's the basic ones.\n10 procedures by which medical care is provided? 10 Q.      In developing those protocols and treatment\n11 A.      It's twofold.  From a policy standpoint it's 11 modules do you follow community standards for medical\n12 done by the Department of Corrections.  But when you 12 treatment, that is, standards that apply outside the\n13 get into individualized clinical care such as the 13 prison context?\n14 ordering of medications or the treatment, specifically, 14 A.      So your definition of community standards is\n15 of a patient, for example, with diabetes that is left 15 outside the prison context?\n16 to the medical contractor, CCS. 16 Q.      So when you develop these protocols and you\n17 Q.      All right. 17 decide what kind of treatment the DOC is going to\n18                So let me be a little more specific 18 provide or offer to inmates what are those protocols\n19 there.  Let's use diabetes as an example.  Are you 19 based on, are they based on national standards for\n20 saying that the Department of Corrections establishes 20 treatment of that particular disease?\n21 the protocols for treatment of diabetes as opposed to 21 A.      I'm not sure there are national standards for\n22 CCS and that CCS only applies those protocols on 22 the types of things that are in the policy.  Again,\n23 individual inmate by inmate basis? 23 it's not involved with choosing medications.  It's\n24 A.      When you use the term treatment we include 24 involved with the system of them being followed on a\nPage 10 Page 12\n1 that as an all encompassing treatment plan.  So if 1 regular basis and laboratory values.  And I don't\n2 we're going to take diabetes as an example, diabetes is 2 believe there are specific national standards that are\n3 identified as a chronic condition.  So the DOC will set 3 agreed upon by everybody for the stuff that is in our\n4 up policies of how that is to be followed, the timeline 4 policy.\n5 and who is to follow them and what laboratory values -- 5 Q.      If I use the term community standards, is that\n6 excuse me, what laboratory tests are to be ordered, the 6 something that you look to in adopting and writing\n7 timelines between seeing patients and those types of 7 protocols and treatment procedures?\n8 things.

Do you know any that are specific to Hepatitis 19                Is it fair to say also that among that\n20 C care and treatment? 20 group approximately 40 percent will at some point\n21 A.

I'm not sure of that percentage off the top of\n23                Doctor Noel, I just want to get some 23 my head.\n24 basic information down about Hepatitis C, what it is 24 Q.

I don't believe I've seen anything that said\n3 percent will contract liver cancer? 3 cirrhosis in 10 years.  But it's very difficult because\n4 A.      I've seen that data.  That's consistent with 4 you don't always know when times 0 was.\n5 what I've seen. 5 Q.      Okay.\n6 Q.      And that some 3 to 5 percent will die from 6                What do you know about the\n7 that condition? 7 manifestations of Hepatitis C with respect to the\n8 A.      Correct. 8 various F stages, that is, what kind of disease has\n9 Q.      And in fact, have you seen data that indicates 9 been seen in people with Hepatitis C if you can give me\n10 that about 19 to 20,000 people in the United States die 10 everything you know about the types of conditions,\n11 of Hepatitis C each year? 11 diseases, pain, suffering that someone will suffer from\n12 A.      I do not know that data. 12 when they have Hepatitis C?\n13 Q.      Okay. 13 A.      Well, most often we talk about -- well, I'll\n14                And other data that shows it is the 14 work backwards from cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis being the end\n15 most deadly infectious disease in the United States? 15 stage of liver disease.  At that time you can become\n16 A.      I'm not sure what most deadly means. 16 jaundice.  You accumulate a lot of fluid which is\n17 Q.      Okay, that's fair. 17 referred to as ascites.  You have a large belly.  You\n18                More people die from Hepatitis C than 18 may have encephalopathic changes which means mental\n19 any other infectious disease in the United States, have 19 status changes.

These are\n22 Q.      Okay. 22 the most significant symptoms and signs.  And\n23                Do you know anything about -- we've 23 obviously, significant changes in blood work that are\n24 talked about progression and you've talked about this 24 consistent with those kinds of things with the\nPage 34 Page 36\n1 F0 to F4 and I've sketched out just some of the 1 cirrhosis.\n2 percentages here.  Do you know anything about the rate 2 Q.      Would you also at that stage see cancer?\n3 of progression for any particular individual or do we 3 A.      Yes.\n4 know anything about that, how quickly one might go from 4 Q.      Would you see renal failure?\n5 F1 to F2 to F3, for example.  How quickly you might get 5 A.      Could be end stage, yes.\n6 to cirrhosis and how many people actually will get 6 Q.      Diabetes?\n7 there? 7 A.      That's a little more nebulous the correlation\n8                MR. GOODMAN:  Objection, it's a 8 between diabetes and cirrhosis.  And I would defer to a\n9 compound question. 9 specialist on tying those two together.\n10                MR. RUDOVSKY:  Let's see if he can 10 Q.      And the reason I ask that I've seen references\n11 answer it. 11 to hepatic disease which we're talking about the liver,\n12                THE WITNESS:  I've seen different 12 right?\n13 numbers.  But in general, it's fair to say that the 13 A.      Yes.\n14 progression of disease -- just we'll call it the 14 Q.      And then also references to extra hepatic\n15 natural progression of the disease is that it takes 15 conditions --\n16 decades and you can see someone that will say 20 years 16 A.      Yes.\n17 and some will say 40 years.  But it's fair to say it 17 Q.      -- and nonhepatic conditions.  Can you explain\n18 takes decades to progress to cirrhosis. 18 in your view what do you understand those differences\n19 BY MR. RUDOVSKY: 19 to be?\n20 Q.      Are there situations that you've seen where 20 A.      Again, I have not dealt personally with these\n21 somebody has progressed to cirrhosis within 10 years? 21 kinds of cases.  These are very rare cases.  And just\n22 A.      I have not personally -- I have no data to 22 as an aside, everyone of these cases gets referred to a\n23 support that. 23 hepatologist because they fall outside the normal\n24 Q.      But you don't dispute that that's a 24 protocol.

Right, again, we have copies that were also\n3 rheumatologic diseases where specialists have found 3 provided by your Counsel.  Are you familiar with this\n4 that there appears to be some correlation in the 4 document?\n5 disease that is not liver related for those who have 5 A.      I am.\n6 Hepatitis C. 6 Q.      Okay.\n7 Q.      And what is your understanding as to whether 7 A.      Let me correct that.\n8 some of the symptoms we've been talking about that you 8 Q.      Yes.\n9 just described can appear earlier or later, that is, if 9 A.      I'm not necessarily familiar with this\n10 you're at F2 isn't it possible you'll have a number of 10 particular document in front of me.  I'm familiar with\n11 the conditions you just described even though you're 11 the website and the fact that they put out this type of\n12 only at F2 as opposed to F4?  And conversely, you might 12 information.\n13 be at F4 and suffer less of those consequences? 13 Q.      Just to be specific, this was the -- while it\n14 A.      Unlikely on having an F2 with those advanced 14 was pulled out of the website more recently.  It was\n15 and I would defer to a specialist on that.  But I have 15 from their October, 2016 their latest update --\n16 not personally ever seen anyone with F2 that had 16 A.      Yes.\n17 ascites and esophogeal varices.  By definition those 17 Q.      -- as to their recommendations, okay?\n18 are consistent with cirrhosis which is an F4. 18 A.      Okay.\n19 Q.      I'm not asking any specific one.  What I'm 19 Q.      Are you familiar with the October the full\n20 asking about is is this kind of linear, that is, simply 20 2016 update?\n21 because you're at F2 means you're only going to suffer 21 A.      I'm familiar with it, yes.\n22 from certain conditions and F4 it's going to be much 22 Q.      Okay.\n23 worse or doesn't the literature sure that, in fact, 23                Have you read that update before today?\n24 it's not linear and it's not a strict concordance 24 A.      I don't remember exactly what I read from it\nPage 38 Page 40\n1 between your F stage and the manifestations you may be 1 to be honest with you.\n2 suffering from? 2 Q.      Okay.\n3 A.      My understanding is that that might hold true 3                Let me just at this point -- we're\n4 as you get closer and closer to cirrhosis.  You can 4 going to go through it in a little more detail.  But on\n5 make a case maybe that there are patients that might be 5 the question I asked you about screening and\n6 at F3 and show some of the manifestations of late 6 surveillance and monitoring for liver cancer even\n7 disease.  But I've never seen anything myself 7 before F4 if you turn to Page 10.  You know what,\n8 personally that I know of when you start getting into 8 they're not marked, I'm sorry.  That's the problem with\n9 F1 and 2 that show those signs and symptoms of advanced 9 this document.  It's 3 pages from the last -- from the\n10 cirrhosis.  I've never seen that correlation. 10 end.  I marked mine 10, but I didn't mark yours.  Okay,\n11 Q.      So let's stick with that 3 for a moment.  Is 11 you got it.\n12 it not true that at F3 there are recommendations from 12                Right below the box, I want to call\n13 the National Medical Association's concern with 13 your attention to the paragraph that reads an accurate\n14 Hepatitis C that those persons be monitored for cancer 14 assessment of fibrosis remains vital, as degree of\n15 on a regular basis? 15 hepatic fibrosis is one of the most robust prognostic\n16 A.      I have not seen that. 16 factors used to predict HCV disease progression and\n17                    - - - 17 clinical outcomes.

And so they are now stating, this organization\n23 you identify that, please? 23 is stating that at F3 you should be monitored for liver\n24 A.      It's the website printout from the AASLD and 24 cancer; is that correct?\n10 (Pages 37 to 40)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 12 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 41 Page 43\n1 A.      That's what that statement says. 1 Q.      Okay.\n2 Q.      Do you agree with that? 2                And how about with Sovaldi?\n3 A.      I have no -- that's for a hepatologist to 3 A.      Less experience with that personally, but the\n4 decide what -- how that translates into current 4 literature seems in that same ballpark of greater than\n5 policies. 5 90 percent.\n6 Q.      Does your protocol deal with that issue? 6 Q.      And any studies to date or reports to date of\n7 A.      Our protocol begins the surveillance for liver 7 any serious side effects from these drugs?\n8 cancer with the diagnosis of cirrhosis. 8 A.      From the drugs by themselves?\n9 Q.      Okay, we'll come back to the protocol and 9 Q.      Yes, that's the question.\n10 we'll do that later. 10 A.      No, just with the caveat that treatment\n11                I want to now, Doctor Noel, ask you 11 regimen includes other drugs.\n12 questions about these direct acting antivirals.  I'm 12 Q.      I understand that depending on the condition\n13 going to refer to them as DAA, all right? 13 of the patient there may be other drugs.  But with\n14 A.      Okay. 14 respect to these what the FDA call breakthrough\n15 Q.      Starting in about 2011 is it true that the 15 drugs -- and do you know what that term means when the\n16 FDAA since that time has approved for treatment for 16 FDA uses the term breakthrough drugs, what's the\n17 Hepatitis C DAA drugs? 17 significance of that?\n18 A.      I don't know the exact timeline.  That seems a 18 A.      The significance is the cure rate.  When we\n19 little early.  If you have documentation that shows -- 19 used the drugs before which were Interferon based I\n20 Q.      I have a reference to 2011 they talked about 20 don't have the exact statistics but it was on the\n21 breakthrough drugs.  But whether it was 2011 or 2012 21 magnitude of 50 percent cure rate.  So from when you go\n22 are we talking about the right timeframe? 22 from 50 or 60 percent cure rate to 90 percent cure rate\n23 A.      Approximately. 23 in a short period of time that's where the term\n24 Q.      The year doesn't matter.  And does that 24 breakthrough came, I believe.\nPage 42 Page 44\n1 include drugs like Harvoni, Sovaldi, Zepatier, 1 Q.      Okay, all right.\n2 Z-E-P-A-T-I-E-R and Epclusa, E-P-C-L-U-S-A? 2                So we've now had whether it's 2011,\n3 A.      It includes those if you understand that they 3 2012 about four years of experience with these drugs;\n4 were chronologically added through the years.  And they 4 is that correct?\n5 were not all at the beginning whatever the beginning is 5 A.      Yes.\n6 which was after 2011. 6 Q.      Okay.\n7 Q.      Right, and do you remember which was the first 7                Now, and I want to refer you back to\n8 drug in that progression? 8 this document which is P-7 which is the as I say the\n9 A.      Sovaldi. 9 October, 2016 iteration from AASLD and IDSA with\n10 Q.      Okay. 10 respect to their recommendations for testing, managing\n11                And Harvoni came soon thereafter; is 11 and treating Hepatitis C.  And as you said before this\n12 that correct? 12 is a document that has its own progression; is that\n13 A.      A year later about. 13 right, that they've been putting out their\n14 Q.      Okay. 14 recommendations for a number of years now?\n15                And is it your understanding and let's 15 A.      Yes.\n16 stick with Harvoni, for example, that that has a very, 16 Q.      As to -- with specific reference to the DAA's;\n17 very high cure rate for Hepatitis C? 17 is that correct?\n18 A.      What's a very high cure rate? 18 A.      Correct.\n19 Q.      Over 90 percent? 19 Q.      Okay.\n20 A.      Correct. 20                Let me ask you this, what was the last\n21 Q.      I've seen references to 95 percent; is that 21 version that you actually read whether it was in\n22 correct? 22 October or June or even earlier this year, but within\n23 A.      We're not seeing 95 percent.  We're seeing 90 23 the last year, I assume you referred to this because\n24 percent. 24 your own protocol refers to it and we have some emails\n11 (Pages 41 to 44)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 13 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 45 Page 47\n1 where you say you reference AASLD in developing your 1 treating HCV by other therapies; is that correct?\n2 protocol.

And that reflects what you just said their\n4 In the past year have you actually had the opportunity 4 recommendation is everybody from F0 to F4 any chronic\n5 to look at their recommendations? 5 Hepatitis C should be treated with the DAA?\n6 A.      Yes. 6 A.      Correct.\n7 Q.      So let me ask you a general question first and 7 Q.      Okay.\n8 then I'll get specific if I have to.  Was there 8                Page 2, there are 2 boxes there.  They\n9 anything in these recommendations and this is a 11 -- 9 talk about the goal of treatment and recommendations\n10 12 page document, that you have looked at in the last 10 for when and in whom to initiate treatment which\n11 year that you had a disagreement with respect to the 11 basically reflects what you just read.  And they have\n12 treatment recommendations and the reasons that they 12 ratings, Class 1, Level A on both of those goals and\n13 give for those treatment modules? 13 recommendations.  Do you know what those ratings refer\n14 A.      I don't have the whole -- and again, this is 14 to?\n15 not the whole document.  This is a very small part of 15 A.      In general, the strength of the scientific\n16 the entire document on a website that it's hundreds of 16 evidenced based literature that they used in coming up\n17 pages long. 17 with that recommendation.\n18 Q.      Well, that include my question to be 18 Q.      And is it fair to say Class 1, Level A is the\n19 everything that you've read, whether it's this document 19 highest level of surety?\n20 or the hundreds of pages of backup information, my 20 A.      I have no knowledge of that.\n21 question still is can you recall over the last year, 21 Q.      Okay.\n22 year and a half, 2 years in reviewing their 22                Continuing on that page, under clinical\n23 recommendations, their data, their studies, their peer 23 benefit of cure, the second paragraph.  Patients who\n24 reviewed articles, anything specifically that you 24 are cured of their HCV infection experience numerous\nPage 46 Page 48\n1 disagree with either with respect to their 1 health benefits including a decrease in liver\n2 recommendations or as to why they were making those 2 inflammation; do you see that?\n3 recommendations? 3 A.

Yes.\n6 it because I don't have it in front of me, that the 6 Q.      Okay.\n7 AASLD comes out more on the side of treating viremia 7                The last sentence in that paragraph,\n8 which means everybody who is positive without 8 among HCV infected persons, SVR which is the sustained\n9 acknowledging very well the need to prioritize and 9 viral response, right?\n10 treat the sickest ones first.  They do have at times 10 A.      Correct.\n11 some language in there and we'll provide that later. 11 Q.      Is associated with a more than 70 percent\n12 But for most people who read this they come away with 12 reduction in the risk of liver cancer which I'll later\n13 the message that AASLD recommends that everybody be 13 call HCC and a 90 percent reduction in the risk of\n14 treated without acknowledging a prioritization.  That 14 liver related mortality and liver transplantation; do\n15 is the thing we have the most difficulty with in 15 you agree with that?\n16 actually trying to operationalize something in a real 16 A.      I don't have enough scientific knowledge to\n17 world scenario inside a closed prison system. 17 disagree with that.  When I read that I had no thoughts\n18 Q.

I have nothing to the contrary.\n20 come back to this prioritization in a moment, okay. 20 Q.

I haven't seen it personally in our population\n7 A.      Actually, those are subjective, not objective. 7 to the level of these superlatives major affect, but it\n8 Pain and suffering and fatigue are subjective. 8 is a factor, yes.\n9 Objective findings such as lab tests correlate a little 9 Q.      And the next sentence reads, the presence and\n10 better but still not completely. 10 severity of fatigue appears to correlate poorly with\n11 Q.      Okay. 11 disease activity, although it may be more common and\n12                The next page, Page 6, there's a 12 severe in HCV infected individuals with cirrhosis, a\n13 paragraph that talks about nonhepatic manifestations 13 study by Poynard, 2002; do you agree with that?\n14 and that references the diabetes which you've already 14 A.      Yes, I agree with that more than the first\n15 talked about; is that correct? 15 one.  It sounds like everybody was tired.  Yes, I agree\n16 A.      Yes. 16 with that second one.\n17                I'm sorry, what's the questions? 17 Q.      Okay.\n18 Q.      Yeah, so this document notes that there's a 18                There's then a reference to a study by\n19 relationship between chronic Hepatitis C and diabetes; 19 Bonkovsky, 2007 and Sarkar, 2012 which indicate a\n20 is that correct? 20 reduction in fatigue after a cure of HCV infection.\n21 A.      That's what it says. 21 Any reason to dispute that statement or those studies?\n22 Q.      Okay. 22 A.      No.\n23                And do you have any disagreement with 23 Q.

It then states fibrosis may not progress 4 5,500 or whatever that number might be in the system?\n5 linearly; is that correct as well? 5 A.      And that's an important point that you brought\n6 A.      Yes. 6 up because we didn't know at the beginning of this.\n7 Q.      And then a little further down, the presence 7 Q.      But now I'm assuming the hypothetical is we're\n8 of existing fibrosis is a strong risk factor for future 8 here today, the drugs are inexpensive, that's not a\n9 fibrosis progression? 9 problem for the DOC.  How long would it take you to\n10 A.      Agreed. 10 treat that population?\n11 Q.      Okay, all right. 11 A.      Our best estimate currently which is -- can be\n12                Now, you qualified your answer in part 12 revised as we go along going forward, is that we can\n13 by saying while you might agree with everything that we 13 treat between 400 and 450 a year based on operational,\n14 just read and it looks like you agreed with most of it, 14 security, logistical issues.\n15 there's no recommendation here for prioritization; is 15 Q.      And that's putting aside the cost factor?\n16 that right? 16 A.      Absolutely.\n17 A.      Correct. 17 Q.      So if these drugs were free the most you can\n18 Q.      Okay. 18 treat is 400 or 450 a year?\n19                And in fact, you mentioned early on and 19 A.      Correct.\n20 my reference to 2014 and so on when the drugs were 20 Q.      So when you talk about priority you then say\n21 first coming into the market there was some 21 -- I don't want to put words in your mouth but I think\n22 prioritization recommended because there weren't enough 22 what I understand is we'll treat the sickest first?\n23 drugs available for everybody to use.  So I could 23 A.      Correct.\n24 understand you had to prioritize if you had a thousand 24 Q.      Okay.\nPage 58 Page 60\n1 possible patients but you only had drugs for a hundred 1                So you try to identify the 400, 450 who\n2 then you would prioritize in what way? 2 are the sickest, start with that group and then work\n3 A.      That was never a case with us.  I'm not 3 your way down?\n4 familiar with that scenario. 4 A.      Correct.\n5 Q.      So your prioritization was not based on your 5 Q.      Okay.\n6 inability that the manufactures didn't have this drug? 6                And would that be true if it was a\n7 A.      Correct. 7 different kind of disease like cancer or diabetes or\n8 Q.      Okay. 8 all of a sudden there's a cure for that particular\n9                And there's the elephant in the room, 9 disease that because you're a prison system you only\n10 we all know what we're talking about here, right.  The 10 would be able to treat in the first year 10 percent of\n11 prioritization you're talking about is funding; is that 11 the people with that condition?\n12 correct? 12 A.      I'm not following your -- you're really going\n13 A.      Not totally. 13 on a hypothetical here so could you rephrase that a\n14 Q.      Well, so let's start this way, aside from 14 little better.\n15 funding and let me give you the hard hypothetical.  If 15 Q.      Well, the 10 percent is based on your saying\n16 these drugs cost $10 for the 8 weeks or 12 weeks that 16 400, 450.  It's actually less than 10 percent because\n17 you have to do it for every inmate, right, would you 17 you got 5,500 inmates with Hep C.  So what you're\n18 not follow what AASLD recommends and treat everybody 18 saying is in that first year the best you can do is\n19 from F0 to F4? 19 somewhere between 7 and 9 percent it sounds like of\n20 A.      I could not.  It's physically impossible. 20 that population.  And I'm asking whether that would be\n21 Q.      I'm sorry? 21 true if we transfer this to a different situation, we\n22 A.      Logistically, operationally and security wise 22 now have a cure for diabetes, some magic cure comes\n23 it would be impossible to treat them all right now. 23 through or a cure for a particular type of cancer which\n24 Q.      And how many could you treat now, again, 24 some inmates may have and it's a large number, right;\n15 (Pages 57 to 60)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 17 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 61 Page 63\n1 would you also have those security limitations? 1 are you paying now your best recollection at this point\n2 A.      It's not fair to use the cancer one because 2 or your best estimate per treatment per inmate what\n3 it's such a small number compared to this.  If we had 3 you're paying for the DAA's?  I know the price has come\n4 another -- let's just take the diabetes if that's where 4 down, but I don't know how much its come down.\n5 you want to go with this.  And there's a cure for 5 A.      I don't have an exact dollar in front of me.\n6 diabetes and we had many thousands, which we do, 6 It's approximately -- give me a second.\n7 diabetics.  And the same medical resources were needed 7 Q.      Sure.\n8 then yes, we couldn't do it all.  We can only do so 8 A.      It's approximately $50,000 for a 12 week\n9 much. 9 course.\n10 Q.      But when you say you can only do so much isn't 10 Q.      Okay.\n11 that also a money factor.  When you say, for example, 11                And so based on your answer you have a\n12 we can only treat 450 people is that because -- I 12 budget for the coming year that would allow you to\n13 understand your term security, but if you hired more 13 treat up to 450 inmates at $50,000 an inmate?\n14 correctional officers, if you hired more medical 14 A.      First of all, the ground rules on the term\n15 people, if you had more contracts with outside agencies 15 year.\n16 to get the drugs, whatever you would have to do, we had 16 Q.      Okay.\n17 a huge emergency, you had all the money that was 17 A.      There's calendar year and there's fiscal year.\n18 available to you, you still can only do 400 to 450 18 So it's important that we deal in fiscal years.\n19 people a year? 19 Q.      Okay.\n20 A.      I wouldn't even know how to answer that.  The 20 A.      So fiscal year '16-'17.\n21 conversations have also been around the cost of the 21 Q.      Which covers what period?\n22 medication.  If you're taking this to another level 22 A.      July of 2016.\n23 where I start building prisons to put people into or I 23 Q.      Right.\n24 start letting them -- if you go bizarre scenarios like 24 A.      To June of 2017.  That's the current budget\nPage 62 Page 64\n1 that I suppose you can come up with a scenario that 1 here that we are in.\n2 said I hired a thousand doctors to do nothing but take 2 Q.      Okay.\n3 care -- you can come up with a bizarre scenario like 3 A.      We didn't know how many we could treat\n4 that, yes. 4 physically with these operational, security and\n5 Q.      I understand you can label that bizarre.  I'm 5 logistic wise.  We're going to treat approximately 250\n6 just testing it to see whether this is security or it's 6 this fiscal year.\n7 something else. 7 Q.      Okay.\n8 A.      Security in the sense of patients have to be 8 A.      Just by the way its lined up.  So our\n9 moved, you know.  You don't just give someone a pill. 9 recommendation is that we can probably treat more than\n10 It's not just writing prescriptions.  You give me a 10 that logistically and security and organizationally and\n11 million dollars and I take 5,500 prescription pads and 11 all those kinds of things.  And then our recommendation\n12 write Harvoni and hand it out to people.  It's not 12 is that we could treat up to 400, 450.\n13 that. 13 Q.      And is there an explanation as to why you will\n14 Q.      I understand that. 14 not be treating 450 this year, if you could do it\n15 A.      The point is is that there's nurses involved, 15 security wise, is it the cost?\n16 doctors involved, security involved in moving inmates. 16 A.      Well, because we only got a couple months left\n17 Sometimes they have to go off-site for testing.  There 17 to go.  We've done 120 and we've seen the speed that we\n18 have to be specialists involved.  There are limitations 18 can get with these.\n19 other than just pure cost of Harvoni. 19 Q.      And what are you projecting for for the next\n20 Q.      And how many are you projecting to treat over 20 fiscal year, 2017-'18?\n21 the next year? 21 A.      I don't have a projection on budget.\n22 A.      400 to 450. 22 Q.      Okay, all right.\n23 Q.      So and of course, my hypothetical was based on 23                    - - -\n24 the notion that it would be very inexpensive.  But what 24                (Whereupon, P-8 was marked for\n16 (Pages 61 to 64)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 18 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 65 Page 67\n1 identification.) 1 looked at?\n2                    - - - 2 A.      Veteran's Administration, Pennsylvania\n3 BY MR. RUDOVSKY: 3 Medicaid, CCS's own corporate protocol.\n4 Q.      Let me explain to you, Doctor Noel, we asked 4 Q.      So there were discussions with CCS about the\n5 for in discovery emails that are related to Hep C 5 -- what the scope of the protocol ought to include?\n6 treatment.  And most of them are emails that you're on 6 A.      Yes.\n7 either receiving or sending an email from 2014 and 7 Q.      Okay.\n8 we've got them through near the end of 2016.  I've 8                Did you look at what Medicare was\n9 given you a pack of these emails.  They're not all the 9 doing?\n10 emails that we received, but their the ones I want to 10 A.      No.\n11 ask you some questions about, all right? 11 Q.      Would it surprise you that Medicare was\n12 A.      All right. 12 providing DAA's to everybody with chronic Hep C?\n13 Q.      And so what I'll do, it's marked P-8, but I'll 13 A.      I don't have any knowledge of that.\n14 identify the particular email by the date of the email 14 Q.      And when you say looked at Medicaid, why\n15 so we'll know which one we're actually referring to. 15 wouldn't you look at Medicare also?\n16 But before I ask you about the emails, it's my 16 A.      The vast majority of our inmates are on\n17 understanding that when the DAA's came out the 17 Medicaid insurance.  So we looked at that not as\n18 Department of Corrections and you, in particular, were 18 automatically doing whatever they do but because they\n19 involved in a process of developing a protocol for the 19 generally come in on Medicaid and they go home on\n20 use and distribution and or administration of the DAA's 20 Medicaid it's just sort of a good starting point for us\n21 to certain inmates with Hepatitis C; is that correct? 21 to look at.\n22 A.      Correct. 22 Q.      Right, but if somebody came into the prison\n23 Q.      And then at some point you developed an 23 with no insurance that wouldn't affect what kind of\n24 interim protocol; is that correct? 24 medical care they got in the prison; isn't that right?\nPage 66 Page 68\n1 A.      Correct. 1 A.      Correct.\n2 Q.      And do you recall approximately the date that 2 Q.      Okay.\n3 was promulgated? 3                Did you look at the Center for Disease\n4 A.      November, 2015. 4 Controls recommendations?\n5 Q.      Okay. 5 A.      No.\n6                And how long had you been working on 6 Q.      Okay.\n7 that protocol before it was actually published, 7                And what was the working group that --\n8 approximately? 8 within the DOC that was developing and drafting this\n9 A.      Most of that year. 9 protocol?\n10 Q.      Okay, so about a year. 10 A.      For the interim protocol?\n11                And in that process I think you've 11 Q.      Yes.\n12 already said that you consulted with certain 12 A.      Doctor Dean Rieger who at that time was the\n13 organizations with protocols that other prisons had 13 Corporate Medical Director for CCS and Doctor Nicholas\n14 developed, for example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons; 14 Scharff who is a CCS physician who had been my\n15 is that correct? 15 predecessor as the DOC Chief of Clinical Services and\n16 A.      Correct. 16 had extensive knowledge but now he was on the private\n17 Q.      You looked at the AASLD recommendations? 17 side and was brought in for consulting also.\n18 A.      Correct. 18 Q.      Okay.\n19 Q.      Aside from those two, Federal Bureau of 19                And during that period as you were\n20 Prisons and AASLD, did you look at any other protocols 20 developing the interim protocol what treatment, if any,\n21 or medical organizational recommendations for the use 21 was being given to inmates with Hep C regardless of\n22 of DAA's? 22 their stage from F0 to F4?\n23 A.      Yes. 23 A.      I don't know the exact timeframes.  I don't\n24 Q.      What else can you recall now as to what you 24 have that in front of me.  There was a time where the\n17 (Pages 65 to 68)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 19 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 69 Page 71\n1 only ones that were receiving treatment were those that 1 Q.      But for inmates who were diagnosed with Hep C\n2 came on treatment.  There were no new starts while we 2 in the prison basically end of 2015, beginning of 2016?\n3 were sorting out the protocol and where the landscape 3 A.      Correct.\n4 of the whole treatment in corrections was going. 4 Q.      And I understand the DOC tests everybody to\n5 Q.      So if somebody came into the system from the 5 see if they've been exposed to the virus; is that\n6 streets, was sentenced and they happen to be on the DAA 6 correct?\n7 treatment outside you would continue it on the inside? 7 A.      It's an opt out.  They can say they don't want\n8 A.      Always. 8 testing.\n9 Q.      Okay. 9 Q.      Right.\n10                And why is that? 10 A.      But absent that we test everybody.\n11 A.      Because they were already on treatment.  We 11 Q.      And when you started -- do you recall when the\n12 didn't want to interrupt something that already had 12 DOC started testing inmates coming into the system?\n13 begun on the streets. 13 A.      For at least a decade.\n14 Q.      Comparably, a few people, right, I mean, is 14 Q.      Okay.\n15 that -- 15                And obviously, people have been there\n16 A.      Correct. 16 longer than that.  They've been there 20 years, 30\n17 Q.      Because we've looked through a lot of the 17 years, 40 years.  Did you also then test everybody who\n18 grievances and a couple that we've already noted and 18 had been there before the testing of new inmates\n19 were inmates were complaining I want the DAA's.  They 19 occurred?\n20 were being told we're reviewing everything, we're 20 A.      I'm not quite sure of that actually.  I don't\n21 developing a protocol.  At this point we're just going 21 know.\n22 to monitor your condition.  Is that fair to say that 22 Q.      Okay.\n23 that's what was going on for a period of time? 23 A.      May I go back to my answer.\n24 A.      Correct. 24 Q.      Sure.\nPage 70 Page 72\n1 Q.      Okay. 1 A.      It caught me off guard.  I'm just trying to\n2                The interim was published in as you say 2 think the way our system works.  I don't believe there\n3 November of 2015 and then the protocol that we'll 3 was anybody in the DOC who has not been offered Hep C\n4 actually be talking about in a little bit, the current 4 testing if that's the question.\n5 protocol was published or promulgated when? 5 Q.      Okay.\n6 A.      November, 2016. 6                And maybe that's something you can\n7 Q.      Okay, a year later. 7 check, right?  I don't want to hold you to it because\n8                And the changes, I assume, that were 8 you don't know it.  I'll follow up with some\n9 made from 2015 to 2016 was based on new information you 9 interrogatories if we have to but I appreciate it.  And\n10 learned, resources, things like that? 10 if anything else occurs to you as we talk, right, feel\n11 A.      Correct. 11 free to amend or correct or change your answer.\n12 Q.      Okay. 12                So if we can refer now to the emails in\n13                What was the first year that you 13 this exhibit.  Start with the one dated Thursday,\n14 started treating any inmates with DAA, if you recall? 14 August 14th from Doctor Rieger who you've identified to\n15 A.      Well, the protocol came out in November of 15 you referring to a conversation he had with a\n16 2015.  I don't remember if there was enough time to get 16 hepatologist from the University of Arkansas\n17 someone started right then but we started immediately 17 for Medical Sciences.  And there's a section here, he\n18 in reviewing the charts. 18 responded to the AASLD product by saying that they\n19 Q.      End of 2015, 2016? 19 obviously did not consider any resource limitations in\n20 A.      Correct. 20 their recommendations which call for treating all (yes,\n21 Q.      But again, to be fair, except for those who 21 all) incarcerated persons with HC infection.\n22 may have come in earlier that year who were already on 22                So as of August of 2014 AASLD was\n23 the drug? 23 calling for treatment of everybody with HC infection\n24 A.      Correct. 24 including incarcerated persons; is that correct?\n18 (Pages 69 to 72)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 20 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 73 Page 75\n1 A.      Yes. 1 Harvoni came out.  There was large discourse across the\n2 Q.      Okay. 2 nation about where everything should be going.  And so\n3                Next email dated December -- well, it's 3 our goal was to get the sickest ones first and get them\n4 a two page document, but it's dated December 28th. 4 going now.\n5 Again, from Doctor Rieger to you.  The bottom one 5 Q.      But by that time AASLD had recommended\n6 first because that's actually December 16th, let me 6 universally, right, across the board, for every\n7 start with that one.  And the email says to you you 7 prisoner --\n8 asked that I send you the CCS HCV guideline.  And I 8 A.      Right.\n9 indicated it had to go through a final review.  Then it 9 Q.      -- and it looks like CCS had at the same time\n10 says as promised it walks away from the F3-F4 criteria 10 said yes, F3-F4 and then they revised it to the more\n11 which were developed when our treatment options were 11 serious condition limited group; is that right?\n12 much poorer.  It is based more on mortality rates 12 A.      Correct.\n13 associated with esophageal varices in F4 than upon the 13 Q.      Okay.\n14 simple presence of serious fibrosis. 14                Next email dated -- from you to\n15                What did you understand from that -- 15 superintendents throughout the system it looks like in\n16 CCS is Correct Care Solutions, right? 16 which you indicate that the DOC --\n17 A.      Correct. 17 A.      Can I have the date, please?\n18 Q.      And then it says as promised it walks away 18 Q.      Oh, yes, I'm sorry, you're right.\n19 from one criteria and adopts another. 19                March 12th, 2014, the bottom one.  The\n20                What's your understanding of what CCS 20 DOC is reevaluating our treatment protocol given the\n21 was recommending? 21 new guidance issued by the AASLD and the IDSA.  As a\n22 A.      What we were looking at in the interim was to 22 result we will continue to monitor patients diagnosed\n23 get those that were the most advanced in their disease 23 with Hepatitis while we evaluate our treatment options\n24 process.  And he was discussing as in the other email 24 moving forward and develop a new treatment protocol.\nPage 74 Page 76\n1 that we should be looking at esophageal varices as one 1                That was the status as of March 12th,\n2 of our guide posts. 2 2014?\n3 Q.      Well, what caused them to -- F3-F4 would 3 A.      Correct.\n4 include more than the esophageal varices; isn't that 4 Q.      And then the email dated March 12th from you\n5 correct? 5 to a number of officials including Mr. Wetzel\n6 A.      Correct. 6 indicating our legal department had crafted a certain\n7 Q.      So they're moving from a regimen of treatment 7 announcement.  And then stating no doubt you have heard\n8 for F3-F4 to a much smaller group? 8 that the new guidelines include drug regimens that may\n9 A.      Correct. 9 cost $80-$100,000 per treatment course.\n10 Q.      And was there a reason given for that change? 10                So you reference the cost there; is\n11 A.      Because there are those within the F4 that are 11 that correct?\n12 more serious than other F4's.  And the F4's are more 12 A.      I did.\n13 serious than the F3's.  So again, it was a 13 Q.      Okay.\n14 prioritization. 14                I'm going to skip the next one and move\n15 Q.      Prioritization based on budget and money; 15 to --\n16 isn't that true? 16 A.      May I ask a general question?\n17 A.      I don't see the word money in there. 17 Q.      Yes.\n18 Q.      I'm not saying it's there. 18 A.      Are these in chronological order?\n19                But what other reason could there be 19 Q.      Yes, they are, they are.\n20 for that change in treatment other than -- 20 A.      Thank you.\n21 A.      Lack of knowledge of what needed to be done. 21 Q.      That's what I'm trying to do here, yes.\n22 The landscaping was changing about how to work these 22                Next one which indicates Friday, March\n23 patients up.  There were no medications.  It started 23 14th, 2014 from you to Michael Hodge.  And who is\n24 off with Sovaldi.  We barely got going with Sovaldi and 24 Michael Hodge?\n19 (Pages 73 to 76)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 21 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 77 Page 79\n1 A.      He's one of the QI nurses in the Bureau of 1 have been tasked with treating those in who it is --\n2 Health Care Services. 2 and then in bold, medically necessary, end of bold to\n3 Q.      You reference the AASLD guidelines that state 3 eliminate the virus from their body.  That would be\n4 patients with fibrosis of 0 to 2 can be delayed until 4 everybody with chronic Hep C; isn't that right?\n5 updated guidelines are developed. 5 A.      Not under -- not in this context.  That's not\n6                What are you referring to as of 6 what I was referring to.\n7 March 14th, 2014? 7 Q.      What else would you be saying?  We have been\n8 A.      My recollection, and again, the AASLD has a 8 tasked with treating those in whom it is medically\n9 website so it's difficult sometimes because it's 9 necessary to eliminate the virus from their body.\n10 updated and you lose the history sometimes.  My 10 A.      Those would be ones that would be suffering\n11 recollection is when they first came out that there was 11 irreparable harm of which is not everybody who has the\n12 some language in there that I would have referenced 12 virus.\n13 that showed that maybe not everybody needed to be 13 Q.      And irreparable harm in your mind at that\n14 treated right away. 14 point meant what?\n15 Q.      I've seen some of the early versions also. 15 A.      Could not be reversed.\n16 One reference was to the inability to get the drugs.  I 16 Q.      At what point does the damage to the liver get\n17 mean, obviously, if you can't get the drugs then you 17 reversed by the cure?\n18 got to prioritize.  But aside from that, anything else 18 A.      It's debatable.  Most of the science will say\n19 you recall specifically? 19 that cirrhosis is permanent.  But there actually is\n20 A.      I do not. 20 literature out there that people can find if they want\n21 Q.      Okay. 21 to try and debate that.  But for just the general\n22                If you go to the next one dated May 22 primary care physician type things in a big setting\n23 21st, 2014 from you to Mr. Oppman and several others. 23 like this we sort of look at the cirrhosis as fairly\n24 Here you refer to tracking about 5,900 inmates who have 24 permanent.  And it's also fairly well established that\nPage 78 Page 80\n1 been diagnosed with Hepatitis C.  Again, I don't want 1 if you have fibrosis the fibrosis does have regression.\n2 to hold you to it.  You said 5,500.  Are we talking 2 Sometimes just without treatment and sometimes with\n3 somewhere between 5,500 and 6,000? 3 treatment.  So our focus on the medically necessary in\n4 A.      Correct. 4 the context of this was to target the patients with\n5 Q.      Okay. 5 cirrhosis.\n6                Is it fair to say that much of this 6 Q.      So once you reach the cirrhosis stage you\n7 email is concerned with the cost -- 7 don't -- even with a cure, right, with DAA's, you still\n8 A.      Yes. 8 have cirrhosis of the liver.  You've eliminated the\n9 Q.      -- of providing DAA.  In fact, you in bold say 9 virus but you still have cirrhosis of the liver?\n10 that at $84,000 per patient that 5,900 inmates were 10 A.      There is some literature that says that you\n11 close to $500,000,000; is that right? 11 can even have some regression from cirrhosis.\n12 A.      That's correct. 12 Q.      Some will, some won't?\n13 Q.      Nothing in this email about security, 13 A.      Correct.\n14 limitations, space, staffing as inhibitions on 14 Q.      Fibrosis, Stage III, cure with DAA, isn't it\n15 providing DAA's to everybody in the system? 15 true that some of those patients will still have the\n16 A.      Well, let me read it, please. 16 fibrosis?\n17                Actually, I did even put a caveat in. 17 A.      Yes.\n18 Paragraph 3, next to the last sentence.  I did even say 18 Q.      And can some of those patients even progress\n19 from a purely clinical perspective there's even debate 19 to cirrhosis after that?\n20 as to whom that includes.  But this was in response to 20 A.      I don't know that.\n21 budget meetings of what and fiscal of which the budget 21 Q.      Okay.\n22 is directed. 22                The next email, August 1st, 2014.  This\n23 Q.      I understand that.  And in fact, in that 23 references the fact that the treatment in 2013 cost\n24 paragraph you just mentioned you have the statement we 24 $1.5 million.  Of course, we're not talking about DAA\n20 (Pages 77 to 80)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 22 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 81 Page 83\n1 treatment there.  We're talking about different kinds 1 itself.\n2 of treatment, right? 2 Q.      Okay.\n3 A.      Correct. 3 A.      It has nothing do with the individual as a\n4 Q.      Okay. 4 patient.  And it's important because you have different\n5                And then you reference the much higher 5 drug regimens that are recommended for different\n6 cost now at $88,000 per patient.  And you say we have 6 genotypes.\n7 not approved any new patients to begin this treatment 7 Q.      Next one, February 11th, 2015, referring that\n8 as both medical and governmental organizations review 8 the budget request to treat Hepatitis C with\n9 these new regimens in light of enormous expense. 9 medications is $4,665,000.  And then you say we'll have\n10                That's what you state, right? 10 the narrative and details typed up before noon.  So\n11 A.      Again, this email is directed to Kitty Large 11 that's the limitation for you for treatment for that\n12 who is a staff budget person.  This is a budget email. 12 budget year, right?  Your DAA's will be limited to\n13 Q.      This is a budget email which is why you're 13 $4,665,000?\n14 referencing the cost -- 14 A.      I think that's backwards.  In a sense of we\n15 A.      Correct. 15 figure out how many patients we can treat and then we\n16 Q.      -- and considerations of cost in the 16 say how much that's going to cost.  I don't go in --\n17 treatment? 17 I'm not a dollar -- I don't go in and say the budget\n18 A.      Correct. 18 amount.\n19 Q.      Okay. 19 Q.      Okay.\n20                Next one, and now we're in 2015, 20 A.      I come up with how many patients we're going\n21 January 16th to Mr. Ginchereau and Doctor Scharff.  You 21 to treat and then calculate what the cost is and then I\n22 say thanks for the review of the Federal Bureau of 22 go to the budget office and say this is a\n23 Prisons guidelines and your recommendation that we 23 recommendation.\n24 treat APRI more than 1.0.  I double-checked my data 24 Q.      Right, and then do you know if you got that\nPage 82 Page 84\n1 from the report I ran after their guidelines were 1 amount that year?\n2 released last year.  Out of 6,000 DOC inmates who were 2 A.      Actually, what happened if we're going to talk\n3 Hep C, 700 had an APRI score of greater than 1.0.  For 3 about that year is that I base that again on the number\n4 purposes of establishing the magnitude of treating them 4 of patients I could treat.  I came up with a number and\n5 all, it would be 700 x $100,000 or $70 million in bold. 5 then I calculated the cost, some of which was the\n6 Somehow, I'm going to have to further prioritize this 6 genotypes because there's different regimens and came\n7 number. 7 up with a dollar amount, okay.  That amount was granted\n8                The only prioritization factor you talk 8 in the budget.  As it turns out through negotiations we\n9 about is cost? 9 got the price down.  I treated the same number of\n10 A.      Correct. 10 patients, that didn't change, that was the constant.\n11 Q.      And so basically what you're saying here is we 11 The variable was the cost which came down and we\n12 can't do it at 1.0 even though that might be the VBOP 12 actually only spent $3,200,000, not because we treated\n13 guidelines.  We're going to have to find a higher APRI 13 less patients, but because the absolute cost of the\n14 score; isn't that right? 14 medication was less.\n15 A.      That's what this particular email says, yes. 15 Q.      And we'll get into what the -- well, let me\n16 Q.      Okay. 16 ask you this, what was the measure that you were using\n17                Just a question on the next one, 17 for who you would treat and who you wouldn't treat at\n18 February 7th, there's a reference to genotypes and the 18 that time?\n19 different numbers of inmates at each genotype.  Just 19 A.      I don't remember all the details, but it was a\n20 quickly, Doctor Noel, what does a genotype refer to in 20 combination of who were the F4's looking at cirrhosis\n21 terms of Hep C? 21 patients, the workup that was needed to evaluate them,\n22 A.      These are subgroups within Hepatitis C.  So 22 off-site services, staff that we had, hepatologists.\n23 not all Hepatitis C is equal.  These are subgroups of 23 All those nonfinancial variables went into coming up\n24 those based on technical aspects of the actual virus 24 with what we thought was a reasonable number for that\n21 (Pages 81 to 84)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 23 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 85 Page 87\n1 particular fiscal year. 1 standard to take them off the medication?\n2 Q.      Next one, April 10th of 2015.  Your email 2 A.      I don't know.\n3 stating we have cost referenced this list of Hep C 3 Q.      And that's what I'm saying, do you know of any\n4 patients who have an APRI of greater than 2.0 with 4 other condition, diabetes, somebody is not following\n5 minimum/maximum dates and come up with 75 who will be 5 the proper diet, heart disease, they're not doing the\n6 here beyond 2020. 6 proper exercise, whatever it might be where the medical\n7                What's the rationale for limiting DAA 7 -- a medical expert or practitioner would withhold a\n8 treatment to those with an APRI score of above 2.0 who 8 cure because the patient or some other treatment\n9 will be there as of this email would have to be there 9 regiment because the patient is doing things in their\n10 for at least 5 more years? 10 life that's kind of contraindicated given their\n11 A.      This was just part of our brainstorming.  This 11 condition?\n12 actually did not come to fruition.  It was just an 12 A.      Well, in the sense of you talk about community\n13 email of thinking of different ways to get the sickest 13 standards Pennsylvania Medicaid seemed to think it was\n14 patients taken care of.  I don't remember the exact 14 a community standard.  You can make a strong case that\n15 logic behind this.  We discarded the notion. 15 there is -- they're more of a community standard in the\n16 Q.      Okay. 16 State of Pennsylvania than a lot of others.  And they\n17                July 7th, 2015, again, from you to 17 actually had a 6 month abstinence.  So I had different\n18 several others in the DOC.  One last question, how did 18 opinions of which I was sorting them out as we moved\n19 we (probably me) come up with 12 months as the 19 through this.  So in answering that question, are there\n20 exclusion time period for time of incarceration, drugs, 20 others, Pennsylvania Medicaid does.\n21 tattoos and general medical compliance?  And then you 21 Q.      Did you get any response to that email from\n22 say Federal Bureau of Prisons has no such restrictions. 22 Doctor Sharff or others?\n23 The VA specifically states there are no published data 23 A.      I don't remember.\n24 supporting a minimum length of abstinence as an 24 Q.      We didn't have anything in what was given to\nPage 86 Page 88\n1 inclusion criterion.  Pennsylvania Medicaid has 6 1 us.\n2 months abstinence.  I am still OK with this criteria. 2 A.      I don't remember.  I did not get an email\n3 I'm just not sure how to answer anyone who would 3 response or I would have given it to you.\n4 challenge them, other than say they're reasonable. 4 Q.      No, I understand that.  I'm going to skip the\n5                Doctor Noel, aside from these 5 next one and I'm going to move to August 20th, 2015.\n6 compliance requirements that you have for the inmates, 6 And there's an exchange here regarding patients who are\n7 no tattoos and others, is there any other disease in 7 unstable.  Just generally, what are you referring to\n8 the DOC or in the outside world that doesn't get 8 there in terms --\n9 treated because the patient is not compliant? 9 A.      My top email here?\n10 A.      I'm not sure that compliant is the word that I 10 Q.      Yeah, we're on the same one.  If you look at\n11 would use in this other than the medical regimen one. 11 the bottom email, 11:58 a.m., from Dean Rieger.  I just\n12 Q.      Right, I understand medical regimen, you got 12 completed looking over IAS, WHO, VA and a few other\n13 to take the pills. 13 entries in the guideline world and could not find\n14 A.      Right, so we'll look at the general -- and we 14 useful commentary regarding a definition of unstable.\n15 do that with others.  If it's their HIV medications and 15 You then respond that you were trying to define\n16 they take them sporadically, they absolutely are 16 unstable for a check off form.\n17 stopped on their medications. 17                I'm just wondering what this exchange\n18 Q.      And I'm not talking about that.  When we get 18 is all about?\n19 to the protocol I noticed things like tattoos -- 19 A.      With the previous medications of Interferon in\n20 A.      The one with tattoos and drugs means that 20 the Interferon days there were specific numbers that\n21 they're involved in high risk behavior to reinfect 21 correlated with the definition of not being medically\n22 themselves. 22 stable such as a certain number with the hemoglobin\n23 Q.      And if somebody is on HIV medication and they 23 AIC.  There were still language that a contraindication\n24 get involved in high risk behavior is it the national 24 might be that a patient had a severe medical condition\n22 (Pages 85 to 88)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 24 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 89 Page 91\n1 that was not stable.  It's just we didn't have a 1 Q.      Okay.\n2 definition of it. 2 A.      Which is what he would be involved with as the\n3 Q.      So the concern was someone who might be 3 pharmacist he only knows the cost of the medication.\n4 eligible for DAA treatment there may be a 4 Q.      All right.\n5 contraindication because of another medical condition 5                The next one is June 30th, the top\n6 which you would then say makes this patient unstable 6 email and we'll get to the protocol.  But you say as of\n7 and perhaps it's not proper to treat them with DAA's? 7 June 30th for purposes of this protocol (an important\n8 A.      Correct. 8 distinction), we're defining cirrhosis based on the\n9 Q.      Okay. 9 platelets/HALT-C.  So you have to have cirrhosis before\n10                And in the protocol that you finally 10 it can decompensate, correct?\n11 came up with, we'll get to it, I forget now.  Did you 11                What were you looking for there, what\n12 have a provision in which you would exclude certain 12 was your question there to Doctor Rieger?\n13 patients based on a case by case basis because of that 13 A.      Well, within cirrhosis there are two\n14 instability? 14 subcategories of compensated and decompensated.\n15 A.      I'm pretty sure we put a general statement and 15 Decompensated is more severe.  So you want to treat the\n16 then we instructed the site medical director that if he 16 decompensated immediately even before you get to the\n17 had any questions about it because there was no 17 compensated.  All could be done in the same short\n18 specific criteria to refer it to us at the committee 18 period of time, but it's prioritization.  So I was\n19 and we would discuss it with the hepatologist and see 19 asking for some technical definitions of how we -- for\n20 if there was a specific case by case basis.  Again, 20 the protocol purposes how we will define decompensated\n21 this does not address the vast majority. 21 versus compensated.\n22 Q.      No, I understand that. 22 Q.      Okay.\n23                Okay, if you would go to the next one 23                The next one is August 10th and it says\n24 which is actually dated March 25th, I apologize, it's a 24 the new Hepatitis C protocol is in the Executive Suite\nPage 90 Page 92\n1 little bit out of order but the response is to a 1 under final review.  When you say Executive Suite is\n2 lawsuit that was filed. 2 that Mr. Wetzel's office?\n3                MR. MAZESKI:  I'm sorry, Counsel, 3 A.      Yes.\n4 there's two March 25th emails? 4 Q.      Okay.\n5                MR.

MAZESKI:  Okay. 7 to approve the protocol?\n8 BY MR. RUDOVSKY: 8 A.      They sign off on all protocols.\n9 Q.      And this is from you to Mr. Gabrielson who is 9 Q.      Okay.\n10 who? 10 A.      Policies.\n11 A.      He is our representative with the pharmacy, 11 Q.      All right.\n12 Diamond Pharmacy. 12                The email dated September 10th, 2015,\n13 Q.      And you pose a question to him about cost for 13 you reference final review of the new Hepatitis C\n14 treatment in Paragraph 4.  And you say Plaintiff's 14 Policy.  Indicating you chose a cutoff of a platelet\n15 claim is that he was denied HCV treatment because of 15 count of less than 75,000 which was about 81 patients.\n16 cost.  And while we will counter that it was because of 16 What was the reason for picking a platelet count of\n17 the release of Sovaldi and the need to find a new 17 less than 75,000?\n18 protocol, he'll be allowed to make some argument.  Some 18 A.      During our own experience with Hepatitis C and\n19 round number for the per patient, per month cost or 19 trying to find some measure to put into a protocol for\n20 something similar ought to suffice. 20 evaluation we found a small cohort of patients that\n21                So again, the reference here is only to 21 didn't fit into our normal criteria.  And those are\n22 cost, not security issues or anything else; is that 22 ones that had a low platelet count but may have had a\n23 right? 23 satisfactory APRI score or a satisfactory HALT-C score.\n24 A.      That's what that paragraph says, yes. 24 And when I say satisfactory, did not indicate that they\n23 (Pages 89 to 92)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 25 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 93 Page 95\n1 needed immediate treatment.  But we actually found that 1 which is a three page document in reverse order by\n2 there was a small cohort that although they didn't meet 2 dates.  The tope one is dated January 22nd, but I want\n3 treatment by some of that criteria they had low 3 to go to the second page and the email dated January\n4 platelet counts that tended to show that maybe they 4 21st, 2016 at the bottom.\n5 were in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.  So what we did 5 A.      Okay.\n6 is we added that as just another little category from 6 Q.      You refer to six Hepatitis C Treatment\n7 what we learned from our own experience, not so much 7 Referral Forms for patients at Laurel Highlands.  And\n8 from the literature and was an addition, not a 8 there's an indication here that the abnormal scores\n9 limitation of the numbers. 9 appear to be more a function of renal disease as\n10 Q.      The next one is October 5th to Christopher 10 opposed to the liver disease.  What's the concern\n11 Oppman.  And who is Mr. Oppman? 11 there, isn't it true that Hep C often has\n12 A.      At this point there's a part in the transition 12 manifestations outside the liver?\n13 I don't know the exact timeline he at one time was the 13 A.      It does and that's why I was deferring to\n14 Director of the Bureau of Health Care Services.  At 14 Doctor Cowan with that question.\n15 some point in this time he was promoted to Deputy 15 Q.      All right, okay.\n16 Secretary for Administration which is one level above. 16 A.      That's simply deferring to Doctor Cowan\n17 And I'm not quite sure at this point -- I take it back. 17 because they did not meet the criteria based just on\n18 So a copy to Andrea Norris.  So Andrea Norris was the 18 APRI scores.  So I'm asking his opinion.\n19 Director of the Bureau.  So at this time it was Deputy 19 Q.      Okay.\n20 Secretary Oppman. 20                And the email right above that from Jay\n21 Q.      And this email refers to the additional cost 21 Cowan to you references this particular group and\n22 under the new Hepatitis C protocol.  So as of October, 22 references what has to be taken into account in terms\n23 2015 based on your prior testimony that interim 23 of treatment or nontreatment, right?\n24 protocol was not yet out, right, it was about to be 24 A.      I'm just skimming over it.  That appears to be\nPage 94 Page 96\n1 published in November, I think? 1 what that is, yes.\n2 A.      Correct. 2 Q.      And in fact, the statement from -- and who is\n3 Q.      And you state in this email that at a sticker 3 Jay Cowan, by the way?\n4 price of $100,000 for course of medication you're 4 A.      At this point in time he is both the Statewide\n5 budgeting $5 million which would allow you to treat 50 5 Medical Director for the Pennsylvania contract for CCS\n6 patients; is that correct? 6 and he's also the hepatologist for this program.\n7 A.      Correct. 7 Q.      Okay.\n8 Q.      So what was the driving factor here the number 8                And I just want to reference the last\n9 of patients who needed treatment or the limitation of 9 sentence in the first paragraph.\n10 the $100,000 times that 50? 10 A.      I need the email again.\n11 A.      Well, again, from my standpoint -- no one told 11 Q.      So it's the January 22nd, 11:09 email on the\n12 me $5 million.  Again, we didn't know a lot of things 12 second page.\n13 about the drugs.  And our working the patients up and 13 A.      Okay.\n14 getting them evaluated and finding the ones that were 14 Q.      Where he's taking about patients with severe\n15 most need of immediate treatment we didn't know what we 15 renal disease.  He says the first step should be to\n16 could do.  So we wanted to get the ones that were 16 assess life expectancy, identify all comorbidities and\n17 sickest.  And just through -- before we actually 17 then consider whether treatment of Hep C infection\n18 evaluated looking at some data we had it seemed that 18 would provide a survival benefit.  In other words, is\n19 there were probably 50 that we wanted to treat right 19 he saying only provide the treatment if it's necessary\n20 away to preclude any irreversible permanent damage. 20 to literally save his life?\n21 And so those are the ones that we targeted.  And then I 21 A.      I would have to ask him that.\n22 backed into the dollar amount from that. 22 Q.      Okay.\n23 Q.      Okay. 23 A.      At this point I had turned all care of Hep C\n24                I want to now look at the next document 24 patients on dialysis over to the hepatologist and\n24 (Pages 93 to 96)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 26 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 97 Page 99\n1 nephrologist. 1 that we will start with the highest APRI scores and\n2 Q.      Okay. 2 work our way down to 1.5.  We might not get all of them\n3                The February 18th email from you to 3 this fiscal year.  Almost 200 of the above have APRI\n4 Mr. Keldie and Mr. Ellers responding to recommendations 4 above 2.0 but those have many of the ones we already\n5 on updated the Hepatitis C protocol.  And you state the 5 addressed.\n6 following, I do not doubt that elastography science or 6                So if I read this correctly, you've\n7 the improvements in defending the protocol, but I need 7 identified an APRI score of 1.5 or higher as those who\n8 to operationalize this within our current fiscal 8 should be treated with the DAA's.  But for fiscal\n9 realities.  It does not help us if the use of 9 reasons you won't be able to do that in that year?\n10 elastography provides us a bucket of potential patients 10 A.      No, that's not at all what we did.\n11 which is too large to treat in a timely fashion. 11 Q.      Then what are you saying?\n12                What did you mean by that? 12 A.      The score of 1.5 or higher indicates those\n13 A.      Well, first of all, it has to do with numbers 13 that will go to elastography.\n14 again.  I'll go backwards and a bucket of potential 14 Q.      Okay.\n15 patients which is too large to treat in a timely 15 A.      That is not a treatment decision, that is a\n16 fashion actually speaks to the issues of 16 testing decision.\n17 operationalizing and security and moves away from the 17 Q.      And then what is meant when you say I'll put\n18 cost factor in the sense of if we did elastography and 18 in the caveat we'll start with the highest APRI scores\n19 there were 500 patients identified we would have to 19 and work our way down but we might not get to them all\n20 still prioritize, couldn't treat them all. 20 this fiscal year?\n21 Q.      Even though the elastography would indicate 21 A.      Just because they had to go off site to a\n22 these people need treatment with the DAA's? 22 central location.\n23 A.      We would need to still refine that into 23 Q.      Okay.\n24 prioritizing. 24                The next one, the September 9th email\nPage 98 Page 100\n1 Q.      And the prioritizing says fiscal realities. 1 refers to the current cost for Sovaldi and Harvoni,\n2 It doesn't say anything about inability to treat.  It 2 right?\n3 sounds like it's lack of money? 3 A.      Historical, right.\n4 A.      No, because the elastography has to do with 4 Q.      The historical cost, right, okay.\n5 the movement of patients.  We have to take them to 5                Looking at the next one, January 11th,\n6 another site actually to have the test performed and do 6 2016 where you're referring to what you call the latest\n7 screening exams and sonograms.  So it's a huge 7 batch of Hepatitis C referrals.  And you indicate that\n8 operational issue. 8 the EGD triggers the referral to you and will be\n9 Q.      I understand that.  But it looks like what 9 current.  What do you mean by that, what are you\n10 you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, but that issue 10 referring to there?\n11 is a fiscal issue? 11 A.      This is under the interim protocol --\n12 A.      The point I was trying -- it was not purely a 12 Q.      Right.\n13 dollar issue.  The point I'm trying to make in this is 13 A.      -- the results of the EGD determining whether\n14 that we can only treat so many in a timely fashion.  We 14 or not the patient had esophageal varices was a\n15 can't treat everybody this year. 15 decision point.  And if they had esophageal varices\n16 Q.      I'm going to skip the next one and I'm going 16 then they would be referred on to Doctor Cowan to\n17 to move to August 20th, 2016 from you to Mr. Cowan and 17 determine the exact medications to be used.\n18 Mr. Keldie.  You reference the Federal Bureau of 18 Q.      That's right, I understand and I appreciate\n19 Prisons guidelines for prioritization.  And you're 19 that.  But it means as a predicate you won't get to the\n20 saying in terms of who you're going to schedule for 20 DAA treatment unless you have the EGD that's referred\n21 elastography your replacing the HALT-C test with the 21 to here?  That's what triggers the referral?\n22 APRI score.  And you indicate a score of 1.5 or higher 22 A.      Correct.\n23 looks good and we have a little over 300 including 23 Q.      Okay.\n24 those treated.  You then say I will put in a caveat 24 A.      I mean, there is some caveat and some unusual\n25 (Pages 97 to 100)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 27 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 101 Page 103\n1 circumstances.  But the general gist of the interim 1 Cathers; do you see that one?\n2 protocol was utilizing EGD results in defining those 2 A.      I do.\n3 who were in need of the treatment more urgently. 3 Q.      At the bottom actually the one I want to refer\n4 Q.      Okay. 4 to is the email at 9:25 a.m.\n5                Let me move a couple more to the 5 A.      I have it.\n6 February 3rd, 2016 from you to Mr. Cowan and Mr. 6 Q.      Where you say you're revising the Hep C\n7 Ellers.  This is still under the interim protocol; is 7 protocol.  And you say that Secretary Wetzel wants us\n8 that correct? 8 to be in line with DHS.  What are you referring to\n9 A.      Correct. 9 there?\n10 Q.      Okay. 10 A.      That's Medicaid.  Pennsylvania Medicaid,\n11                You're giving them a status of the Hep 11 Department of Health Services.\n12 C Program.  And you state that you're not on track for 12 Q.      And Medicaid has its own protocols and\n13 our target of 50 patients by July 1st.  You reference 13 standards for which medication patients will get --\n14 the number of patients you have.  And what was the 14 A.      Correct.\n15 problem there, did you ever get a response to that or 15 Q.      -- the DAA's right?\n16 what the problem was? 16 A.      Correct.\n17 A.      Well, as I said before when we set up the 17 Q.      And the secretary was saying we ought to be\n18 fiscal year target I wanted to treat 50 patients during 18 following Medicaid in terms of the DOC policy?\n19 that fiscal year.  And we are now in February and at 19 A.      In line with, yes.\n20 the rate we were going we would not get to 50.  So we 20 Q.      Okay.\n21 would be short of the target.  So I was putting the 21                And has that ever been done?\n22 email out to try and see some feedback as to what was 22 A.      We actually supersede them now.  We treat --\n23 going on. 23 their current -- I stand corrected on that.  Let me\n24 Q.      I'm going to have to ask you to go back a few 24 back up, that was not correct.  I believe their current\nPage 102 Page 104\n1 documents which you already turned.  I'm looking for an 1 one is to treat F4, 3 and 2.\n2 email that's dated February 18th, 2016.  It's about 8 2 Q.      And are you aware that there are negotiations\n3 or 9 back. 3 going with them where they have now agreed within the\n4 A.      Okay. 4 next year to treat everybody with chronic Hep C?\n5 Q.      And it's to Carl; do you see that?  Thanks for 5 A.      I've heard water cooler talk.  There's nothing\n6 sharing your recommendations? 6 been put out anywhere formalizing anything.\n7 A.      Yes. 7 Q.      But you've heard that those discussions are\n8 Q.      Okay. 8 ongoing?\n9                It reads thanks for sharing your 9 A.      I've heard those discussions, yes.\n10 recommendations on how to update our Hepatitis C 10 Q.      But in any event, at this point Medicaid of\n11 Protocol.  I do not doubt the elastography science or 11 Pennsylvania was giving this drug to more to a larger\n12 the improvements in defending the protocol, but I need 12 group of persons than the DOC was?\n13 to operationalize this within our current fiscal 13 A.      They didn't even prioritize.  The way I read\n14 realities.  It does not help us if the use of 14 it is that if you have an F0 or 1 you actually are not\n15 elastography provides a bucket of potential patients 15 eligible for treatment.  Our protocol you are eligible\n16 which is too large to treat in a timely fashion. 16 but you are on the lowest list of prioritization.  So\n17                What are you referring to there? 17 you can look at that two different ways.\n18                MR. MAZESKI:  Objection, we asked and 18 Q.      Has there been a single person --\n19 answered that already. 19 A.      No.\n20                MR. RUDOVSKY:  All right, okay, I'm 20 Q.      -- in the history of the DOC that has been\n21 sorry, okay. 21 treated at F0?\n22 BY MR. RUDOVSKY: 22 A.      No.\n23 Q.      Let me move back now.  The next one I want to 23 Q.      F1?\n24 refer to is Wednesday, May 25th from you to Terri 24 A.      No.\n26 (Pages 101 to 104)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 28 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 105 Page 107\n1 Q.      F2? 1 120 already.  This is for this current fiscal year.\n2 A.      Not that I know of but there may be some -- 2 And we're on target to do another 120.  The updated\n3 there are extra hepatic manifestations that fall within 3 goal from this email was 240 this fiscal year.\n4 those categories and stuff.  But not purely on liver 4 Q.      Okay.\n5 disease. 5                The September 4th email which\n6 Q.      Okay. 6 references the fact -- I assume it's drafting of the\n7                How about F3? 7 protocol we're operating under now.  But you reference\n8 A.      Have we treated F3, oh, many, many. 8 the fact that the final document needs approval by the\n9 Q.      With DAA's? 9 secretary; is that right?\n10 A.      Absolutely. 10 A.      Yes.\n11 Q.      How many in the last fiscal year? 11 Q.      Okay.\n12 A.      I don't have -- 12                So the current protocol that we're\n13 Q.      I know you don't have the exact number but an 13 operating under was actually authorized by Secretary\n14 approximation? 14 Wetzel?\n15 A.      Well, in this fiscal year we have treated 120 15 A.      Just to be clear, Secretary Wetzel signs off\n16 patients to date with either F3 or F4.  And we are on 16 on every policy in the DOC, has final authority.\n17 target to treat another 120 with F4 or F3 by the end of 17 Q.      He's got final authority to do that?\n18 this fiscal year.  At that time I believe we will have 18 A.      On every policy within the DOC.\n19 addressed and either treated or excluded everyone known 19 Q.      Okay.\n20 to have F4 or F3.  And the plan is then to move into 20                I'm going to skip the next one and I'm\n21 the F2 list realizing that we're going to have people 21 going to go to the last email or last batches of emails\n22 come in to the system that are already F3 and F4 and of 22 in September 13th, 2016.  But I want to spends a little\n23 course they'll have the highest priority.  But 23 bit of time on this one.  It's an email from you to\n24 beginning July, 2017 we will begin looking at the F2's. 24 several others in the DOC which is your corrected\nPage 106 Page 108\n1 Q.      On that same document that I just referred to 1 version of an attachment.  And the attachment -- we\n2 Secretary Wetzel there's two emails in response.  The 2 have the attachment there and it says Hepatitis C\n3 first from Terri Cathers saying that the pharmacy and 3 treatment-radical.  I just have a question about that\n4 therapeutics committee met on May 17th, 2016 and 4 title.  First of all, who drafted that and what was the\n5 recommended that the department eliminate evaluation of 5 meaning?  It looks like a proposal for Hep C treatment\n6 fibrosis scores from prior authorization guidelines. 6 and what's meant by the term radical?\n7 Do you know what she's referring to there? 7 A.      I drafted it.  I put that catchy little phrase\n8 A.      I think what you just brought up. 8 so I could find it again, actually.  I had difficulty\n9 Q.      Okay. 9 finding all my various drafts and proposals and things\n10 A.      That they're looking to possibly change their 10 like that with Hepatitis C.  I'm not very\n11 guidelines.  And this is what we were hearing talk of 11 technologically savvy.  So I picked that catchy little\n12 but there's nothing in the documents. 12 phrase because it was something I was working on so I\n13 Q.      Okay. 13 could find it again much to my chagrin.  That's all\n14                The July 14th email references a 14 that was.\n15 tentative budget for the coming fiscal year, 2015-'16 15 Q.      Okay, so let's talk about the substance here.\n16 of $10.2 million in order to treat 170 patients; is 16 You start off by saying that the APRI score which you\n17 that right? 17 had been using, right, as a measure of who to treat and\n18 A.      Correct. 18 who not to treat as of that time has significant\n19 Q.      Okay. 19 limitations; is that correct?\n20 A.      Which has been adjusted. 20 A.      That's correct.\n21 Q.      It has been -- 21 Q.      Okay.\n22 A.      Adjusted. 22                And then you go on to say given that\n23 Q.      Okay, in what way? 23 although we cannot state this with medical certainty,\n24 A.      This is the one where I told you we've done 24 generally speaking, a patient with an APRI score of\n27 (Pages 105 to 108)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 29 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 109 Page 111\n1 less than 1.5 is unlikely to be in immediate danger of 1 correct?\n2 developing permanent liver damage within the next year 2 A.      Correct.\n3 and you go on to say certain things.  So are you saying 3 Q.      Okay.\n4 here that an APRI score of less than 1.5 there will be 4                And in fact, all the major medical\n5 some individuals who may be in immediate danger of 5 organizations now say you should use elastography and\n6 developing permanent liver damage within the next year? 6 direct biomarkers for determining if you're going to\n7 A.      I wasn't saying that.  I was just trying to 7 prioritize at all which patients to give the DAA's to?\n8 make sure everybody understands when we use these 8 A.      I have no knowledge of that statement.\n9 scores that they're just not rock solid science. 9 Q.      Okay.\n10 They're not absolutes.  So that was just sort of 10                And I think I referenced this when we\n11 putting wiggle room in that.  I don't have any specific 11 looked at the AASLD guidelines where it said the APRI\n12 knowledge about correlating lower APRI scores with 12 was not sensitive enough to rule out substantial\n13 developing cirrhosis and irreparable damage.  These 13 fibrosis.  So using the APRI score itself you can miss\n14 scores are not absolute.  That was my message. 14 people with substantial fibrosis?\n15 Q.      I have a couple of questions about the APRI 15 A.      You can.\n16 score, actually.  Because in a number of the documents 16 Q.      Okay.\n17 it talks about a sensitivity level and a specificity 17                Have you -- on this question of who to\n18 level.  You're familiar with that terminology? 18 treat and what the cutoff is consulted with Doctor\n19 A.      Yes. 19 Hauser at the Pennsylvania Department of Health?\n20 Q.      And there's a document which I'll get to that 20 A.      Yes.\n21 with using a score of 2.0 or higher as a measure for 21 Q.      And what have you consulted with him about in\n22 DAA treatment that the sensitivity level of that score 22 terms of the treatment in DOC?\n23 is only 48 percent.  Does that mean your missing half, 23 A.      He's the coordinator for Hepatitis C\n24 possibly half the people who should be treated? 24 epidemiology in the Department of Health.  So we just\nPage 110 Page 112\n1 A.      Who have -- if you're using that to define 1 shared general data.  He's mostly interested in\n2 cirrhosis, then there could be those that have lower 2 epidemiological data.  And he's a point of contact for\n3 scores that might have cirrhosis. 3 me in the Department of Health for just asking\n4 Q.      Right. 4 questions in general about Hepatitis C landscape and\n5                And so -- and the 2.0 was the number 5 the Commonwealth.\n6 you were using for quite some time, right, as a cutoff? 6 Q.      Okay.\n7 A.      In prioritizing, yes.  Again, prioritizing, 7                I want to ask about this question of\n8 not excluding. 8 APRI scores and elastography and biomarkers.  If\n9 Q.      I understand that.  But from that there would 9 elastography and direct biomarkers is a better and more\n10 be at least as many at least approximately.  It looks 10 accurate measure why isn't the Department using that\n11 like it's 50/50 who you are treating and those who 11 now as opposed to APRI scores?\n12 you're not treating because APRI is a very I would say 12 A.      Actually, we've gone above and beyond to my\n13 blunt, right, measure.  It's not very precise. 13 knowledge every Department of Corrections system at\n14 A.

The next level is\n15 A.      Because we treat everybody above 2 without 15 2.0 to 1.5, okay.  Do they all have cirrhosis, probably\n16 testing. 16 not, but now these are sensitivities.  But what they do\n17 Q.      But if you're in that 1.5 to 2 that's only 48 17 now is we take them to elastography.  Elastography says\n18 percent accurate; is that correct? 18 F4 or F3 they are treated.  If the elastography says\n19 A.      Correct. 19 they are 2, 0 or 1 they go back on low priority.\n20 Q.

But the plan is to get them\n10 Q.      Everybody 2.0 and above is now getting DAA's? 10 all to elastography and identified as either F4, F3 to\n11 A.      That is correct. 11 treatment, F2 and lower can wait.\n12 Q.      Okay. 12 Q.      Do you have good data on how many inmates are\n13 A.      If they're 1.52, again, it's the APRI starts 13 either 1.5 to 2.0 APRI score level?\n14 losing its sensitivity we're sending them to 14 A.      Yes, not with me but we have exact data.\n15 elastography to make the determination of their F4, F3, 15 Q.      Can you give me an estimate of how many?\n16 F2. 16 A.      No, I have too many numbers in my head, sorry.\n17 Q.      So everybody 1.5 and above is being sent -- 17 Q.      Can you give me an estimate of how many of\n18 1.5 to 2.0 is being sent for elastography? 18 those have actually gone to elastography?\n19 A.      Correct. 19 A.      Everyone that's got a number on here.\n20 Q.      But I'm now asking the final question there is 20 Q.      Okay.\n21 in the 1.5 to 2.0 range there's a roughly 50 percent 21 A.      So there's approximately probably less than\n22 chance of missing somebody who is actually at a more 22 100.\n23 advanced stage; isn't that true? 23 Q.      Okay.\n24 A.      I'll take them to elastography and I'll know. 24 A.      I don't know that number.  The number can be\n33 (Pages 129 to 132)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 35 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 133 Page 135\n1 derived by looking at the data on there. 1 you just testified to.  Is the meaning of this\n2 Q.      Does this document include everybody 1.5 or 2 provision that an inmate/patient has to advance to the\n3 higher? 3 cirrhosis stage before they will get DAA treatment?\n4 A.      Yes, well, generally. 4 A.      Well, you're saying that backwards.\n5 Q.      Okay. 5 Q.      Okay, correct me.\n6 A.      There's somebody hiding out there that we 6 A.      The correct way to say that is that everybody\n7 missed. 7 we find with cirrhosis gets treatment immediately,\n8 Q.      I understand. 8 immediately.\n9 A.      There's a tab that has everybody, okay.  So 9 Q.      And this is your section that deals with how\n10 the job of the ICN, Richard Wenhold, is to take those 10 to identify those with cirrhosis?\n11 in an Excel, sort out by labs and pull everybody with 11 A.      This is an educational piece to help the\n12 1.5 out, create this and we evaluate them to see where 12 clinicians in the field identify those that we know or\n13 they are in the protocol. 13 have a high probability -- they have a high enough\n14 Q.      And as you say the way we know from this 14 probability of cirrhosis that they don't need to\n15 document whether somebody has been evaluated beyond the 15 proceed onto further evaluations.  That they are\n16 APRI score is whether there is a fibrosis score 16 immediately going to go to treatment.\n17 entered? 17 Q.      Okay.\n18 A.      That means they've had elastography in our 18                On the next page, subsection 3 of D\n19 system under this protocol. 19 which refers to abdominal imaging studies such as\n20 Q.      And if they don't they haven't had the 20 ultrasound.  What's the meaning of that provision and\n21 elastography yet? 21 when is it used?\n22 A.      Someone could have had elastography in the 22 A.      This was used in case a patient had had one of\n23 civilian world and come in and it may not have made it 23 these tests done outside of the official protocol but\n24 on here.  It's sort of set up for at the end of the 24 had it on their medical chart that we would take that\nPage 134 Page 136\n1 month we get our elastography reports, you pull this 1 into consideration of possibly making the diagnosis of\n2 up, you feed them in.

And it refers to the\n7                Aside from elastography the AASLD 7 significance of hepatic compensation in determining the\n8 recommended combining that with direct biomarkers. 8 most appropriate treatment regimen and refers to a CTP\n9 What's the meaning of that? 9 score as a useful tool to help determine the severity\n10 A.      It said it was more efficient.  I don't know 10 of cirrhosis and to distinguish between compensated and\n11 that it said recommended unless you take me back to 11 decompensated liver disease in patients with known or\n12 that document. 12 suspected cirrhosis; is that correct?\n13 Q.      Okay. 13 A.      That is correct.\n14 A.      It did say it's more effective. 14 Q.      Okay.\n15 Q.      And what are direct biomarkers? 15                There's then a chart which lists CTP\n16 A.      They're more sophisticated blood tests of 16 score and indicating whether there's compensated\n17 which I don't have a lot of knowledge about.  I've had 17 cirrhosis or decompensated cirrhosis.  If one has\n18 very little knowledge about.  We don't utilize them. 18 decompensated cirrhosis will they be treated with DAA's\n19 Q.      So you're relying basically on the 19 under this protocol?\n20 elastography test combined with the APRI score? 20 A.      They will be referred to Doctor Cowan to see\n21 A.      Yes. 21 if it would be appropriate as a hepatologist to treat.\n22 Q.      Okay, all right. 22 Decompensated cirrhosis can include those that are on\n23                I'm going to section D on Page 20-2 23 death's doorstep, it can.

Backing up, 1 missing here?\n2 you are not excluded for treatment for being 2 Q.      I'm looking at what you're looking at which is\n3 decompensated, okay.  You are sent to a hepatologist 3 the table.  And you break down cirrhosis between\n4 for final evaluation of what medication regimen is 4 compensated and decompensated.  I understand on the\n5 appropriate or if not. 5 decompensated you may have reached the stage where it's\n6 Q.      And to use someone who has reached that stage 6 too late to even use these drugs, it's not going to\n7 and it may just be too late, right, as you say with 7 help; is that correct?\n8 decompensated you may be on death's door.  If that 8 A.      Correct.\n9 person had been treated at F1 or F2 they would have 9 Q.      So I'm now focusing on the compensated\n10 never reached decompensated cirrhosis; is that correct? 10 cirrhosis, this is F4, right --\n11 A.      I don't know enough to answer that question. 11 A.      That's correct.\n12 Q.      Let me put it this way, if the cure rate with 12 Q.      -- they're in the cirrhosis stage.  It's\n13 Harvoni is over 90 percent and you're at F2 then you've 13 compensated cirrhosis and what I'm asking is why are\n14 got a 90 percent chance of never going to cirrhosis; is 14 you dividing the world between these two as to who gets\n15 that correct? 15 treated and who doesn't?\n16 A.      Restate that, please. 16 A.      I'm asking you, sir, where you see in here\n17 Q.      If the Harvoni cure rate is 90 or 90+ percent 17 that they are not treated?\n18 for all persons with HCV, if you're treated at F0, F1 18 Q.      Well, let me get -- we'll do that when we get\n19 or F2 you've got a 90+ percent greater chance of never 19 to the priority stages, okay, maybe that's where the\n20 going to cirrhosis; isn't that correct? 20 answer is in this document.  Let's hold off on that.\n21 A.      If that cirrhosis was 100 percent caused by 21 A.      Okay.\n22 Hepatitis C. 22 Q.      I want to go to section F, additional\n23 Q.      Okay. 23 interventions for inmates with cirrhosis.  And I want\n24                Let's talk about compensated cirrhosis. 24 to go to F2 which is the top of 20-4 which talks about\nPage 138 Page 140\n1 That's still cirrhosis, compensated cirrhosis; is that 1 HCC screening?\n2 correct? 2 A.      Yes.\n3 A.      Correct. 3 Q.      Liver ultrasound is recommended every 6 months\n4 Q.      Kind of a less serious stage? 4 for patients with both cirrhosis and chronic HCV\n5 A.      Correct. 5 infection.  Is that actually being done at the DOC?\n6 Q.      I take it under this formulation in your 6 A.      Every patient with cirrhosis, yes.\n7 protocol if you are only diagnosed with compensated as 7 Q.      But it says both cirrhosis and chronic HCV\n8 opposed to decompensated cirrhosis you won't 8 infection.  Is that others who don't have cirrhosis but\n9 automatically get DAA treatment? 9 have chronic HCV infection?\n10 A.      That's an incorrect statement. 10 A.      No, it's just the ones with cirrhosis.  I'm\n11 Q.      How would you state it then? 11 not sure of the wording on that.\n12 A.      I would say any and all patients who have a 12 Q.      If you're at F3 will you be getting -- this is\n13 diagnosis of cirrhosis are at the top of the list and 13 cancer.  HCV refers to liver cancer; is that correct?\n14 are immediately treated. 14 A.      Correct.\n15 Q.      Then why is the protocol distinguished between 15 Q.      And we've seen other references in other\n16 these groups and talk about the CTP score as a 16 documents that talk about monitoring at F3 at least in\n17 significant factor in who gets treated and who doesn't 17 other systems.  And my question is whether the DOC\n18 get treated? 18 monitors for HCC if somebody is at F3?\n19 A.      It's a significant factor of what they're 19 A.      No.\n20 treated with. 20 Q.      Not until you're at F4 cirrhosis?\n21 Q.      When you say what they're with what do you 21 A.      Correct.\n22 mean? 22 Q.      Now, maybe this refers back to the question I\n23 A.      What regimen of medications. 23 asked you before on number 3 screening for esophageal\n24                Is there a particular line that I'm 24 and gastric varices by EGD is recommended for patients\n35 (Pages 137 to 140)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 37 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 141 Page 143\n1 diagnosed with cirrhosis.  Now, if everybody with 1 seen in the literature.\n2 cirrhosis is being treated with DAA's why would you 2 Q.      When will you begin to see jaundice in a\n3 have to have this additional screening? 3 patient, could you see it at F2 or F3?\n4 A.      Because you can treat the varices. 4 A.      No.\n5 Q.      And how would you treat them differently than 5 Q.      Not until F4?\n6 from the DAA's? 6 A.      Maybe late F3.  It's a continuum.  So I've\n7 A.      You physically ban them. 7 never seen jaundice except in either cirrhosis -- the\n8 Q.      So it's not a requirement to get the DAA's 8 very latest of F3 and in 2 months they're going to be\n9 that you actually have these varices? 9 -- there's a continuum there.  So I don't think it's\n10 A.      Correct. 10 correct to be using hard and fast numbers.  But\n11 Q.      Okay. 11 basically the jaundice is not in early disease.  The\n12                I want to now move to subsection G, the 12 jaundice is in late disease.  And if you want to split\n13 chronic care clinic.  What is the chronic care clinic? 13 exactly which F it clicks into I'm not knowledgeable\n14 A.      It's a tracking system.  All our patients who 14 enough to tell you that.\n15 have been identified with a chronic medical condition, 15 Q.      Okay.\n16 hypertension, diabetes, seizure, asthma are put into a 16 A.      I will tell you that jaundice correlates with\n17 computer system where they're brought up periodically 17 blood tests where as fatigue does not.\n18 and evaluated just for that specific disease entity 18 Q.      I want to go to H, evaluation for treatment\n19 just in the long-term management of their disease. 19 with the antiviral medication.  I want to go to number\n20 Q.      Okay. 20 2, determining whether PA DOC priority criteria for\n21                And then on Page 20-5 are a number of 21 treatment are met is an important part of the initial\n22 factors or conditions that would be documented in the 22 evaluation and ongoing management of inmates with\n23 progress note with respect to persons with chronic 23 chronic HCV infection.  Although all patients with\n24 Hepatitis C.  And my question is this, if you look both 24 chronic HCV infection may benefit from patient certain\nPage 142 Page 144\n1 at the subjective and objective factors are there 1 cases are at a higher risk for complications or disease\n2 conditions here that could exist at F1 and F2 when you 2 progression and require more urgent consideration for\n3 look at this list are there conditions here that could 3 treatment.  That's in the protocol, right?\n4 affect somebody who you've determined is at F1 or F2? 4 A.      Correct.\n5 A.      No, not that I have personal knowledge of. 5 Q.      And so it does state, does it not, that every\n6 Q.      What if a person is with fatigue? 6 person with chronic HCV which is the 5,500 or so in the\n7 A.      Fatigue wasn't on the list. 7 DOC would benefit from this treatment?\n8 Q.      But I'm asking separately if somebody has 8 A.      Correct.\n9 severe fatigue could they be at F1 or F2? 9 Q.      And the AASLD says everybody it's a medical\n10 A.      Yes. 10 necessity to treat everybody with chronic Hep C?\n11 Q.      Okay. 11 A.      I'm not sure they use the word medical\n12                What other -- let me phrase it this 12 necessity.  That's a significant word in our world.\n13 way.  At F1 or F2 what other abnormalities have you 13 I'm not sure they used the word medical necessarily.\n14 seen or read about in the literature and it may be very 14 Q.      Do you know why they would recommend universal\n15 rare, but it may not be, aside from fatigue in terms of 15 treatment aside from -- with the exclusions we talked\n16 mental depression, in terms of other pain and 16 about why they would recommend what I'll call universal\n17 suffering, extra hepatic conditions, what's possible at 17 treatment for everybody with chronic Hep C if it's not\n18 those stages? 18 necessary or beneficial to that person?\n19 A.      The depression one I read somewhat about, but 19 A.      Beneficial.  But medically necessary for\n20 in our system our patients are followed by a mental 20 everybody to get treated right away, we disagree with\n21 health team outside of the medical evaluations.  So I 21 that.\n22 don't have a lot of personal knowledge within our 22 Q.      Okay.\n23 system of correlations between depression and Hepatitis 23                But not with the fact that it's\n24 C.  And those are the two general symptoms that I've 24 beneficial?\n36 (Pages 141 to 144)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 38 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 145 Page 147\n1 A.      Correct. 1                And so people at F3 are certainly at a\n2 Q.      And once you get to F3 what are the symptoms 2 higher risk for HCC than at F2 or F1 or people who\n3 you're likely to see in somebody in F3? 3 don't have any Hep C at all.  Which is why, isn't a\n4 A.      Again, I just answered that.  There's early 3 4 true, a number of organizations recommend testing for\n5 and there's late 3.  So the symptoms -- the general 5 HCC once you're at the fibrosis 3 stage, that would be\n6 symptoms of fatigue, yes, that can be there. 6 the rationale?\n7 Depression, I defer to mental health because they 7 A.      I don't know what the rationale is.\n8 address all of that.  The primary care physicians do 8 Q.      Okay, all right.\n9 not.  My experience is is that it's the F4's that 9                Moving on to priority level 3.  I'm\n10 develop the ascites and encephalopathy and esophageal 10 sorry to level 2 now.  Once you're at fibrosis level 3\n11 varices and those late state manifestations. 11 do you know of any data that indicates the likelihood\n12 Q.      Okay. 12 of progressing to 4?\n13                Let's turn to the priority levels 13 A.      No.\n14 starting at 20-7.  So the highest priority for 14 Q.      Let me put it this way, is it a higher number\n15 treatment priority level 1, known cirrhosis or clinical 15 than if we look at the group from F0 or F1?\n16 findings consistent with cirrhosis.  And cases of 16 A.      Yes.\n17 decompensated cirrhosis with a CTP score of 7 or above 17 Q.      So percentage wise as the disease progresses\n18 are the highest priority; is that correct? 18 you're more likely to progress to the next level?\n19 A.      That's what it says, yes. 19 A.      That seems logical, yes.\n20 Q.      Which would -- so again, distinguishing 20 Q.      Okay.\n21 between decompensated and compensated, right, 21                Priority level 3 which is the stage 2\n22 decompensated is the highest category? 22 fibrosis indicator.  That's a group of patients who are\n23 A.      Correct. 23 not now receiving DAA's?\n24 Q.      Would compensated be within priority level 1? 24 A.      Correct, understanding that that number 2\nPage 146 Page 148\n1 A.      Yes, under the term cirrhosis. 1 where it says APRI score of 1.5 to 2.0, if they have\n2 Q.      Right, and then where it says patients with an 2 1.5 to 2.0 they get elastography.  And if it shows that\n3 isolated APRI score of 2.0 or more with no other 3 they're an F3 then they're moved up to the next higher\n4 clinical findings of cirrhosis are included in priority 4 level on priority and are, in fact, treated.\n5 level 2? 5 Q.      Right, because that's because we now recognize\n6 A.      Correct. 6 they're at F3 and they shouldn't be classified at F2.\n7 Q.      So not automatically treated? 7                Are individuals at F2 sick?\n8 A.      Correct, and that speaks to the sensitivity of 8 A.      Sir, could you define sick for me?\n9 the test alone. 9 Q.      They're suffering from an illness.  They've\n10 Q.      Okay. 10 got an infectious disease.\n11                Let me look at subsection 3 under 11 A.      Patients with Hepatitis C they all have\n12 priority level 1 referring to HCC which is liver cancer 12 infectious disease.\n13 it states at least one-third of all cases of HCC occur 13 Q.      And some of them will be suffering some\n14 in association with HCV infection.  With most cases 14 symptoms, manifestations of the disease?\n15 occurring in those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; 15 A.      Some will have symptoms.\n16 is that correct? 16 Q.      Okay.\n17 A.      That's what it says, yes. 17                Priority level 4 is a stage 0 to 1; is\n18 Q.      So included in that are individuals at F3; is 18 that correct?\n19 that correct? 19 A.      Correct.\n20 A.      Again, that's a spectrum. 20 Q.      Okay.\n21 Q.      I understand a spectrum. 21                You then have a section on what you\n22 A.      But that would be advanced fibrosis is a 22 call other criteria for treatment which look to me to\n23 definition of F3. 23 be kind of exclusionary factors, right, that is, you\n24 Q.      Okay. 24 may fit the priority level but we're not going to treat\n37 (Pages 145 to 148)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 39 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 149 Page 151\n1 you for some other reason; is that correct? 1 conditions, cancer, diabetes, cardiopulmonary\n2 A.      Correct. 2 conditions which would be contra-indicatory as to\n3 Q.      Okay. 3 DAA's; is that correct?\n4                Let me just go through a few of these. 4 A.      Correct.\n5 On F sub number 3, have sufficient time remaining on 5 Q.      And if that's true and I understand there's a\n6 their sentence to complete a course of treatment.  I 6 small group of inmates that conform to that category,\n7 think you said the treatment courses are either 8 weeks 7 but you anticipate some.  If those men or women had\n8 or 12 weeks at this point; is that correct? 8 been treated at F1, F2 or F3, you wouldn't have gotten\n9 A.      Usually there's some outliners that are 9 to that stage; is that correct, where the condition was\n10 longer.  But generally, 8 or 12. 10 contra-indicatory?\n11 Q.      And we need some time to obviously set them up 11 A.      No, not at all.  These are nonliver\n12 once you decide DAA's are appropriate -- 12 conditions.  It has nothing to do with their Hepatitis\n13 A.      Correct. 13 C.  So if I have a patient in congestive heart failure\n14 Q.      -- it will take perhaps a few weeks to 14 and his heart disease has nothing to do with his\n15 schedule and start the dose; is that right? 15 Hepatitis C, he is so sick that to treat him for\n16 A.      It could take longer than a few weeks. 16 Hepatitis C would not be the correct medically epical\n17 Q.      Okay. 17 thing to do and we would not treat him.  He would be\n18                So what is the DOC policy as to what 18 excluded for an unstable medical condition.\n19 sufficient time means? 19 Q.      So take the patient who at F2 has no other of\n20 A.      6 months. 20 these conditions.  We know from F2 to F4 may take\n21 Q.      So everybody now who you would decide to 21 several years.  If you had treated him at F2 you'd\n22 provide DAA will get it unless they're going to be out 22 eliminate -- if you get the cure you eliminate the Hep\n23 within 6 months? 23 C.

We've talked about this before under 4, life 1 condition; is that correct?\n2 expectancy of more than 18 months.  The AASLD 2 A.      Correct.\n3 recommends 12 months.

In other words, new arrivals don't immediately\n9 a structured treatment regimen which I understand is 9 get treated.\n10 taking the medication, compliance.  And to abstain from 10 Q.      But a new arrival at F4 where you would\n11 high risk activities while incarcerated. 11 normally treat him why would you treat that person\n12                Is that provision high risk activities 12 differently than somebody who has been there a year or\n13 a limitation or exclusion on any other medical 13 two?\n14 treatment in the DOC? 14 A.      The main reason is because a lot of liver\n15 A.      No. 15 disease that comes into our system normalizes and the\n16 Q.      I want to go down to 6 now which you call 16 liver regenerates just by the mere fact that they're\n17 exclusionary indications.  First, as to medical 17 not doing drugs and drinking alcohol.  So the liver has\n18 exclusions and we've talked about this before.  The 18 a capacity to regenerate.  And so by just allowing them\n19 unstable medical condition that is somebody whose got 19 to have forced abstinence over a period of time often\n20 another medical problem, right? 20 starts them on the road to recovery without having any\n21 A.      Correct. 21 kind of treatment.\n22 Q.      So if I understand this correctly, things have 22 Q.      And would that be true of someone who comes in\n23 become so complicated that when you're looking at 23 at F4?\n24 somebody for DAA treatment they have other diseases or 24 A.

Okay. 5 on the referral forms that come to the committee\n6                I want to talk a little bit about the 6 whether or not they're approved for medications,\n7 Hepatitis C Committee, all right, which is on Page 7 immediate treatment or whether they can be delayed.\n8 20-10.  You already testified that it's currently you 8 Q.      So if I get it right, based on the information\n9 and Mr. Wenhold on the committee, right? 9 you receive on all the medical tests that are done\n10 A.      That's correct. 10 whether it's APRI score, elastography or whatever other\n11 Q.      And the one open position would be somebody to 11 information you have about that patient, coinfection, I\n12 be from CCS? 12 understand there's a lot of things you might want to\n13 A.      Correct. 13 consider, priority levels and so on.  Are you the sole\n14 Q.      A medical person from CCS.  And are you now 14 person making the decision that inmate A gets treated\n15 interviewing for that or looking for that position? 15 as opposed to inmate B and how you prioritize?\n16 A.      Well, we just -- this has all recently 16 A.      Under the committee the way it's set up or\n17 happened in the last 3 months.  So we tasked CCS with 17 right now.  The way it's set up, no, I have the CCS\n18 coming up with someone. 18 Medical Director.\n19 Q.      Okay. 19 Q.      Okay, but I'll get to that in a minute.  So\n20                So regardless of who the person is -- 20 tell me what the CCS Medical Director's role is in\n21 A.      Uh-huh. 21 determining who gets treated as opposed to once we\n22 Q.      We've got three positions there.  Tell me the 22 decide they're going to get treated what type of drugs,\n23 responsibilities for each of those three positions? 23 you know, and what other drugs they might need.  But on\n24 A.      Well, the easiest one is the infectious 24 the decision it's kind of binary, yes or no with DAA's,\nPage 154 Page 156\n1 control coordinator.  In this case, we talked about 1 whose making that decision?\n2 Richard Wenhold.  His job is administrative, keeping 2 A.      He and I -- first of all, we go over the cases\n3 the tracking sheets and keeping the paperwork moving. 3 together.\n4 So the referral forms, he keeps track of them, our 4 Q.      Okay.\n5 signing off on what needs to be done, take them to him 5 A.      Not separately.\n6 and if we need more information he works them with the 6 Q.      Right.\n7 site to coordinate the decisions of the committee. 7 A.      So we don't go over them and then vote on it.\n8 Q.      So he's got no role in determining who will 8 And we come to a common agreement.  And generally\n9 get DAA and who won't? 9 speaking, if one thinks treatment or one doesn't think\n10 A.      That is correct. 10 treatment unless there's some clinical reason, you\n11 Q.      Kind of a record keeper? 11 know, we generally defer to giving them the treatment\n12 A.      Exactly. 12 if you have to make it.  But I have ultimate\n13 Q.      Main responsibility is the spreadsheet? 13 responsibility.  We haven't come across this yet.  It's\n14 A.      Correct. 14 not set up in black and white.  But I have ultimate\n15 Q.      And literally just entering data as opposed to 15 responsibility for the program and I'm the one that\n16 evaluating patients or deciding who should or who 16 signs the paper on whether or not they're approved or\n17 should not get treatment? 17 not approved.  So putting pen to paper, I guess, would\n18 A.      Correct. 18 have me ultimate.  But we have an equal role on the\n19 Q.      Okay. 19 committee.\n20                And that's how that position was 20 Q.      Okay.\n21 envisioned and that's what he does? 21                And then beyond that equal role in kind\n22 A.      Correct. 22 of determining who should be treated and who shouldn't,\n23 Q.      Okay. 23 I think you referenced the fact that once you decide to\n24                And your role whether it's you or 24 treat that person is a medical person who is going to\n39 (Pages 153 to 156)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 41 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 157 Page 159\n1 do what, what in addition will that person do? 1 is a new landscape on the pure medicine of the whole\n2 A.

No. 7                And the fact that as they say Medicare,\n8 Q.      And why would you treat all 5,500 even though 8 AASLD, Institute for the Study of Liver Disease,\n9 some are at F0 or F1 and have a number of them 9 private insurance, I understand we may dispute this\n10 literally no symptoms, their daily life is the same as 10 that Medicaid in Pennsylvania is moving to that as\n11 if they didn't have Hep C, why would you treat them 11 well, treat everybody regardless of the stage, there\n12 with the drug? 12 are negotiations going on.

Well, I'm always careful with the patient's\n15 Q.      Okay. 15 choice.  I mean, for all I know the patient is making\n16 A.      We haven't got that far down into discussing 16 the choice because what he saw on TV last night.

And based on that, obviously, I'm not asking 5 fiscal year which would be the end of June for a total\n6 for exact numbers.  Because it looks like we got a 6 of 240 to 250 for fiscal year 2016-'17.\n7 fairly small cohort of F3 and F4, we got about 400 or 7 Q.

Realizing again, that we will have done 15 we're currently in -- so looking at last fiscal year,\n16 everybody down to 1.5 this fiscal year.  Realizing 16 not the current one, '15 to '16, the amount spent was a\n17 because of that we will done everybody fiscal year 17 little more than $3 million; is that correct?\n18 '16-'17 we will have looked at everybody down to 1.5. 18 A.

Do you remember making any decisions regarding 1 Q.      Have you ever received any commentary or\n2 his medical treatment? 2 recommendations from anyone from the site level\n3 A.      I believe I became first involved with his 3 regarding individuals with Hepatitis C?\n4 medical treatment under the interim protocol and when 4 A.      No.\n5 he was being approved to have the EGD done to see the 5 Q.      So just some background.  I see that you in\n6 significance of his disease.  I believe I first became 6 2012 -- and you testified earlier that from 2012 to\n7 involved then.  But as I mentioned before, all the 7 2014 you were the Pennsylvania State Medical Director\n8 final decisions on treatment or not treatment, you 8 for Wexford?\n9 know, do come to the committee which I'm on. 9 A.      Correct.\n10 Q.      So even generally, he as an individual with 10 Q.      And that was -- at that time Wexford,\n11 chronic Hepatitis C if he was referred to the committee 11 specifically, was the medical subcontractor for the\n12 you would have had some role in making a decision, yes 12 Pennsylvania Department of Corrections?\n13 or no, whether to receive DAA's? 13 A.      Correct.\n14 A.      Correct. 14 Q.      At that point in time do you know if you were\n15 Q.      And in that process do you ever review his 15 involved in any decision making relating to medical\n16 medical records? 16 care for people with Hepatitis C?\n17 A.      Only the referral sheet itself, not the full 17 A.      Yes, in general, yes.\n18 medical record. 18 Q.      Okay.\n19 Q.      And can you tell me more about the referral 19                Can you tell me just what your role was\n20 sheet, how do you get it and who creates this referral 20 then?\n21 sheet? 21 A.

Do you know if you had any involvement in\nPage 174 Page 176\n1 Infectious Control Nurse and the Corrections Healthcare 1 making decisions relating to medical care of\n2 Administrator. 2 Mr. Chimenti during that time period?\n3 Q.      Of that institution or... 3 A.      I don't recollect.\n4 A.      Yes. 4 Q.      Were you aware at all that Mr. Chimenti was\n5 Q.      Okay. 5 making requests to receive the DAA's starting in late\n6 A.      At the site level.  Everything is filled out 6 2013?\n7 at the site level and filled in with laboratory data, 7 A.      I don't remember the timeframe.  Late 2013 I\n8 test results of any diagnostics, the EGD, elastography, 8 would have still been with Wexford.  Again, I don't\n9 liver biopsies, all the results are put on that.  In 9 remember.  So in January of 2014 I came in to my\n10 addition, the screening for sentencing, when he came 10 current position.

Okay.\n13 or doing elicit drugs within the institution.  Each one 13                Do you have any role -- when an inmate\n14 has a little bit part of putting that form together and 14 files a grievance relating to let's say Hepatitis C\n15 then it's sent up to our office. 15 treatment, and specifically, the DAA's.  Do you have\n16 Q.      And typically, do you get any descriptions in 16 any role in responding to those grievances?\n17 that referral sheet? 17 A.      Yes.\n18 A.      What would be a description, give me an 18 Q.      In late -- why don't you explain what role you\n19 example? 19 have in that?\n20 Q.      So are you simply receiving numbers like the 20 A.      In the grievance process?\n21 lab results kind of what we see in the data tracking 21 Q.      Yes.\n22 sheet or do you get any type of commentary, 22 A.

And at that time depending on exactly what 4 was out of order.  And there's an email from you\n5 the grievance is we would request parts of the medical 5 stating I agree with having a follow-up EGD on Mr.\n6 record or information from the site in order to address 6 Chimenti.

And was it a common practice for you to email\n18 A.      Yes. 18 about a particular individual and their -- whether or\n19 Q.      Okay. 19 not they should receive the DAA treatment for Hepatitis\n20                So even if your name isn't on it you 20 C?\n21 may have had some involvement in upholding or denying 21 A.

Okay.\n3 A.      No. 3                So do you know relating to this email\n4 Q.      For example, Mr. Chimenti filed a grievance 4 if you had at that point in time received a referral\n5 back in November of 2014 and he received a response and 5 sheet about Mr. Chimenti?  Can you tell that from the\n6 the Department of Corrections had not yet approved the 6 email or out of practice would you know that?\n7 use of Harvoni would you have been involved in that 7 A.      No, I can't tell by this.  I don't know.  I\n8 grievance response? 8 don't remember.\n9 A.      Yes. 9 Q.      So if you could turn to what's labelled Page\n10 Q.      You would have? 10 3.  It's an email that at the bottom is signed by Dean\n11 A.      I began in January of 2014.  So if you're 11 Rieger.  The date isn't on that particular page, but I\n12 saying November, 2014 then yes, I would have been. 12 believe it's dated December 22nd, 2014.  Page 2 at the\n13 Q.      I don't believe it was signed by you, but you 13 bottom says from Dean Rieger sent Monday, December\n14 would have had some -- 14 22nd.  And on Page 3 there's the text of that email.\n15 A.      Our policy is that all grievances are signed 15                So in this case in the second paragraph\n16 off on by the Bureau by the Director. 16 Doctor Rieger notes, previously, Mr. Chimenti had a\n17                    - - - 17 liver biopsy demonstrating \"probable cirrhosis, Stage\n18                (Whereupon, P-15 was marked for 18 4.\"  (5/3/10, presumably May 3rd, 2010.)

YEH: 21 demonstrated esophageal varices (October 19th, 2005)\n22 Q.      It's a little bit out of order.  But these are 22 and the second of which demonstrated no varices.  And\n23 -- P-15 is a set of emails, a string of emails between 23 then in the next paragraph he says as you know, we are\n24 you, Dean Rieger, John Kephart and then a number of 24 looking at Metavir Stage 4 (cirrhosis as consisting of\n45 (Pages 177 to 180)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 47 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 181 Page 183\n1 several stages.) 1 single line out of an email is that his was a very\n2                So at this point in time based on 2 complicated medical case with having been treated\n3 Doctor Rieger's email it was known that Mr. Chimenti 3 multiple times unsuccessfully and multiple diagnostics\n4 had probable cirrhosis stage 4; is that right? 4 and specialists.  And to the best of my recollection we\n5 A.      That's what this email -- probable cirrhosis 5 were just trying to sort everything out of where he was\n6 stage 4, yes, that's what it says. 6 in his disease progress at that time.  You quote in the\n7 Q.      And based on your earlier testimony that would 7 email the results of a test done 4 years prior.  So I\n8 indicate that he was further along in terms of the 8 think we were just trying to update what his clinical\n9 progression of Hepatitis C; is that right? 9 status was.\n10 A.      Further long than someone who had an F3 or an 10 Q.      And through that updating process you knew or\n11 F2, yes. 11 would have known that he was at stage 4?\n12 Q.      Okay. 12 A.      He was at probable cirrhosis stage 4 on May\n13                And under your current treatment 13 3rd, 2010.  You're asking me where he is on December of\n14 protocol he would be in the priority category? 14 2014.  As we talked about the science of this is that\n15 A.      Yes. 15 he may have regressed.  He had been treated twice and\n16 Q.      Okay. 16 even though he didn't obtain an SVR he did have a\n17                Now, this was back in late 2014.  At 17 response to the virus.  So it could very likely be that\n18 that point in time was the interim protocol in effect? 18 he had regressed and no longer had cirrhosis and maybe\n19 A.      No. 19 had advanced fibrosis or whatever.  We talked about\n20 Q.      It was not? 20 that.  So just to make decisions on something that\n21 A.      November of 2015. 21 happened 4 or 5 years ago knowing that things could\n22 Q.      Can you tell me based -- and going back to 22 change, you know, would not be good medicine.\n23 your email response what it is that you meant in your 23 Q.      So do you remember what happened next?\n24 email.  I agree with the follow-up EGD of Mr. Chimenti. 24 A.      Yes, he had the EGD.  The results were that he\nPage 182 Page 184\n1 Can you please have Doctor Kephart order the procedure 1 did not have esophageal varices.  And so he was put\n2 and explain to Mr. Chimenti that's part of workup to 2 lower down on the list so we could get the ones that\n3 determine eligibility for Hepatitis C treatment? 3 did have esophageal varices because it had been\n4 A.      We have not formalized.  It had not been 4 determined that those have a higher priority within our\n5 released, but we were working on it.  So even in the 5 cohort that we were trying to immediately treat.\n6 central office as we were dealing on case by case 6 Q.      And you know, I understand you had testified\n7 instead of having a whole system responsive to a policy 7 earlier about your prioritization rationale.  Putting\n8 we were still following our patients.  We were still 8 that aside, had he received the DAA treatment at that\n9 getting information from the site on patients.  I don't 9 time would it have prevented any further progression of\n10 remember where exactly he fits in with that.  I don't 10 Hepatitis C for him?\n11 have the details of that.  But this sounds like we were 11 A.      That's individual.  I can't comment on\n12 planning on putting the EGD in the policy.  And so we 12 Mr. Chimenti's case.\n13 were sort of going by those guidelines amongst 13 Q.      But in general, if an individual once they\n14 ourselves.  And so that's why I made the statement to 14 receive DAA's 90 percent of the individuals no longer\n15 tell Mr. Chimenti because there wasn't an actual policy 15 have Hepatitis C in their system?\n16 but that's the way we were going with this whole thing. 16 A.      That is correct.\n17 And that we needed that to determine his eligibility. 17 Q.      So if he received DAA's at that time he would\n18 Q.      So at that point in time you were aware that 18 have had a 90 percent chance of eliminating the\n19 there were DAA medications? 19 Hepatitis C virus?\n20 A.      Yes. 20 A.      Correct.\n21 Q.      And based on these emails you would have been 21 Q.      And you had stated earlier you had not\n22 aware that Mr. Chimenti was at stage 4 or likely at 22 reviewed his medical records independently?\n23 stage 4? 23 A.      Maybe bits and pieces that came through\n24 A.      All I remember about Mr. Chimenti absent a 24 especially when the issue of the mass on his liver came\n46 (Pages 181 to 184)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 48 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 185 Page 187\n1 up I was getting parts of his medical record trying to 1 to do it the right way.  And so at some point in time I\n2 assist with working through that whole issue. 2 don't remember where yes, I became more involved in it.\n3 Q.      Okay. 3 Q.      Did you have any decision making role in -- at\n4                And were you aware that he was 4 that point in time whether or not to give him DAA's?\n5 reporting fatigue, that he wasn't feeling well, that he 5 A.      Yes.\n6 was having trouble thinking? 6 Q.      And so at that point he did not receive the\n7 A.      I don't remember those.  They may have been 7 DAA's, presumably, you had final authority at that\n8 contained in something like the grievance.  You asked 8 point in time to say no, he should not get DAA's right\n9 if I see symptoms.  That might come in a grievance but 9 now?\n10 not in a Hepatitis C referral form.  So I don't 10 A.      Correct.\n11 recollect any of that. 11 Q.      And do you recall the reasons why you said no\n12 Q.      So when you respond to the grievance do you 12 around that time?\n13 review them, read them? 13 A.      I don't remember the specific details of the\n14 A.      I'm sorry, do I read the grievance? 14 case.  He did not meet criteria.\n15 Q.      Yes. 15 Q.      Had he met the criteria in the treatment\n16 A.      Yes. 16 protocol would he have received the DAA's?\n17 Q.      Okay. 17 A.      Oh, absolutely as he has now that he meets\n18                So you likely would have read it but 18 criteria.\n19 you might not have an independent memory of that right 19 Q.      In terms of the timeframe the mass showed up\n20 now? 20 in the CT scan about October of 2016.  And then\n21 A.      Correct. 21 subsequently at least from Mr. Chimenti's perspective\n22 Q.      And so had he received the DAA's at that time 22 he was informed that he had to undergo a liver biopsy\n23 it's likely his symptoms in terms of fatigue and not 23 before he could get further treatment or be referred to\n24 being able to remember things, his feeling ill, would 24 a hepatologist.  Did you have any role in that\nPage 186 Page 188\n1 have been alleviated? 1 decision?\n2 A.      I cannot say that. 2 A.      I not only don't have any role in that, I\n3 Q.      Is there a chance that he would have -- those 3 don't recollect that decision and would not\n4 symptoms would have been alleviated? 4 substantiate it unless you have something in writing\n5 A.      If they were all directly related to Hepatitis 5 contrary to that.\n6 C and he had the virus removed from his body, there's a 6 Q.      And do you know who -- if that was a decision\n7 chance that those symptoms would have been alleviated. 7 who would have been the one to make that?\n8 Q.      You had talked earlier that you were aware 8 A.      Which decision?\n9 that he later had developed a mass in his liver? 9 Q.      That he needed a liver biopsy?\n10 A.      Yes. 10 A.      Generally speaking, which I think applies to\n11 Q.      Do you remember when you became aware of that? 11 his case is that if you think someone has cancer you\n12 A.      No. 12 get a liver biopsy.  And someone was saying he had\n13 Q.      And you talk about your role in that whole 13 cancer, some non-medical person.  And we had him\n14 process, what was your role, were you being consulted 14 referred to a specialist who said it's not a cancer,\n15 or just kept aware or what was your involvement in 15 it's a vascular lesion.  And if I stick a needle in\n16 that? 16 there there's a high likelihood of a bad outcome.  And\n17 A.      I don't remember exactly where the lawsuit 17 that's where the conflict came in all of that.  So I\n18 came in or the grievances and the letters from 18 don't know where along the lines somebody recommended\n19 whichever lawyer that was saying he had cancer.  When 19 that there be a biopsy.  But that was only not\n20 all of that becomes -- you know, it's high visibility 20 performed because another off-site specialist, not one\n21 now and it was a complicated medical case.  It wasn't 21 of us, said that that was very dangerous.\n22 as easy as some of the other Complainants in here where 22 Q.      And at that point in time would it have been\n23 it's fairly cut and dry as far as our prioritization. 23 appropriate to send him to a hepatologist for review?\n24 This one was a complicated medical case and we wanted 24 A.      You're assuming he was not sent to a\n47 (Pages 185 to 188)\nWWW.KLWREPORTERS.COM\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-11   Filed 11/02/17   Page 49 of 53\nDr. Paul Noel\nPage 189 Page 191\n1 hepatologist. 1 protocol, and again, the protocol is for the 99 percent\n2 Q.      Correct? 2 he was the 1 percent that fell out of the protocol\n3 A.      I'm not so sure that Doctor -- I don't know. 3 because of the liver mass.  It wasn't a matter of\n4 I'm not so sure -- you're saying Doctor Cowan was not 4 reviewing it per protocol performs.  I was kept\n5 involved in his case? 5 up-to-date every time there was some type of a decision\n6 Q.      Well, was he?  I guess I'm asking you because 6 point that was made or a specialist had seen him or a\n7 -- 7 diagnostic test had come back I would be updated on it.\n8 A.      Well, you would have to show me documentation. 8 Q.      Do you recall having to make any yes or no\n9 Doctor Cowan came onboard in January of 2016. 9 decisions for him more than once, for example?\n10 Q.      Uh-huh. 10 A.      Not necessarily yes and no.  I gave feedback.\n11 A.      And if the first CT was abnormal in 2015 in 11 Again, the -- once you come out of the protocol you\n12 October and I don't know -- I don't dispute the dates, 12 become a medical -- and he became more a pure medical\n13 but I don't know.  It's only logical that he was 13 case than he did a protocol case.  And I know that the\n14 involved during the year of 2016 with his case.  And we 14 litigation is around the lawsuit and those things.  He\n15 would have to look at the record and you can ask Doctor 15 became a complicated medical case which means it relies\n16 Cowan.

But I have no 5 included the Medical Director, Doctor Frommer, Doctor\n6 recollection or documentation of that happening. 6 DeBellis and other individuals.  Were you aware of that\n7 Q.      Okay. 7 at all?\n8                Well, the medical records are a little 8 A.      I don't remember the date.  If you gave me the\n9 thin in terms of your name or Doctor Cowan's name so 9 subject matter I might have remembered.\n10 that's why I'm asking you that. 10 Q.      Okay, I don't believe you were present.  But\n11                Were there any other hepatologists on 11 what happened at the meeting was Mr. Chimenti had an\n12 staff at that time? 12 opportunity to speak to the medical staff about his\n13 A.

You had mentioned earlier that you were aware 14 well as to see a hepatologist or a transplant\n15 of the lawsuit and the litigation.  And were you aware 15 hepatologist.  From his understanding, he was informed\n16 that we as Mr. Chimenti's lawyers have written a letter 16 that the request would be forwarded on to central\n17 on his behalf, obviously, directed to your Counsel, not 17 office.  He was told central office.  Did you ever\n18 to you directly, regarding his medical treatment? 18 become aware of any type of request like that?\n19 A.      I don't remember exactly. 19 A.      A request to start the medications?\n20 Q.      Do you remember if -- how frequently you 20 Q.      Yes.\n21 reviewed Mr. Chimenti's medical case in terms of 21 A.

And do you have any independent memory of\n4 hepatologist or a transplant hepatologist would you 4 Daniel Levya at all?\n5 just to clarify here what role would you have had, if 5 A.      No, other than reviewing his referral form and\n6 any, in making that decision? 6 not approving it.\n7 A.      The formal process of going to off-site 7 Q.      Okay, that's your only memory of Daniel Levya\n8 specialists is CCS.  But because of this particular 8 that you have reviewed his referral form?\n9 case I'm sure I was probably asked my opinion, asked 9 A.      Correct.\n10 for my support which I gave.  It wasn't a matter of 10 Q.      And do you recall why he was denied?\n11 approval or disapproval.  And I'm not in that loop.  So 11 A.      Because of his low APRI score.\n12 technically, I'm out of all of that.  But because of 12 Q.      Okay.\n13 this case I am sure they would have asked my support 13                And again, would he fit within the\n14 and I did support it, yes. 14 recommendation of the AASLD to receive the DAA's?\n15 Q.      As you know Mr. Rudovsky had earlier gone 15 A.      Yes.\n16 through the AASLD recommendations that all individuals 16                MS.

And just by way of background, I pulled the\n5 recommendation that all individuals be treated with 5 numbers for Levya and Maldonado from the most recent\n6 DAA's? 6 tracking sheet.  But anyway, so Doctor Noel, in the\n7 A.      Yes. 7 First Amended Complaint filed by Mr. Chimenti, Levya\n8 Q.      Okay. 8 and Maldonado there's specific sections for each of the\n9                I'm just going to ask you a couple of 9 three named Plaintiffs.  And with respect to Mr. Levya,\n10 questions about the other two named Plaintiffs. 10 paragraph 67, he alleges he currently experiences\n11                Do you have any independent memory of 11 symptoms of Hepatitis C including pain, fatigue and his\n12 David Maldonado? 12 eyes are jaundice and he required immediate treatment\n13 A.      Minimal. 13 to prevent any further liver damage.\n14 Q.      And what is that? 14                So based upon that my first question is\n15 A.      I reviewed his referral form and disapproved 15 in your experience does Hepatitis C cause someone to\n16 his treatment with medications. 16 feel pain?\n17 Q.      And what was the basis for the disapproval? 17 A.      Not until the end stage when physically the\n18 A.      A low APRI score. 18 accumulation of the fluid called ascites in the belly\n19 Q.      Now, based on the number that you had before 19 that's when they seem to experience significant amount\n20 you -- and the recommendation by the AASLD would he fit 20 of pain.\n21 under their recommendation that all individuals be 21 Q.      And in looking at what I have here as far as\n22 treated? 22 the data the numbers of Mr. Levya's most recent test\n23 A.      Yes. 23 results is there anything to indicate that he's at that\n24 Q.

The most recent blood test here that 15                EXAMINATION\n16 correlates with jaundice is a Bilirubin 0.5.  And you 16                    - - -\n17 do not see jaundice -- clinical jaundice until a 17 BY MR. RUDOVSKY:\n18 Bilirubin is at least 3.0.  So there's no laboratory 18 Q.      Let me just ask a couple questions on\n19 data that correlates with that. 19 follow-up.\n20 Q.      So based upon the laboratory data you see -- 20                You said that one would not have\n21 the most recent laboratory data of Mr. Levya does any 21 substantial pain due to Hep C until very late stages\n22 of that -- is any of that consistent with the symptoms 22 when the fluid builds up and so on.  But isn't it true\n23 he's alleging in the Complaint or would support the 23 people could have pain at F3 and F2, fatigue, related\n24 symptoms that's alleged in the Complaint? 24 to other conditions that they have, extrahepatic\nPage 198 Page 200\n1 A.

I'm not going to say that they can't have\n3 says Maldonado suffers from elevated liver enzyme 3 pain.  I don't know how to correlate that directly with\n4 levels beyond the normal range.  In these lab test 4 the Hepatitis C excluding all other things.  So I don't\n5 results for Maldonado is there anything in there that 5 know.\n6 relates to liver enzyme levels? 6 Q.      I understand that.  But when the patient says\n7 A.      When the term liver enzymes are used generally 7 I have pain it's possible that it's Hepatitis C before\n8 they're referring to the ALT and the AST.

You were given a bunch of clinical data and\n11 limits of normal which is 40.

How did that come about?\n3 A.     Due to the lawsuit that I had and that I\n4 filed and was still ongoing.\n5 Q.     Okay.\n6 A.     And I believe that I was the first one in\n7 the state to receive the triple therapy.  I was the\n8 very first inmate in the entire state to receive it\n9 because of how bad my liver was at that time.\n10 Q.     Right.\n11 A.     So it was bad then.  It's even worse now\n12 three years later, a lot worse.  I can't even do\n13 none of the things I was able to do then now.\n14 Q.     Okay.  Let's -- let me stop you right there.\n15 Let's just explore that so we get that out of the\n16 way.\n17 A.     All right.\n18 Q.     What things can't you do now that you could\n19 do three years later?  I mean, how is your life\n20 worse now because of what you're suing in this\n21 case?\n22 A.     Well, how my life got worse?  Well, I --\n23 Q.     Let's talk about in terms of your daily\n24 activities.\n25 A.     I have no daily activities.  I can't do any\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 6 of 22\nPage 32\n1 daily activities.  That's the thing.  I have no\n2 energy whatsoever, none.  I could sleep 24/7.\n3 Q.     Okay.\n4 A.     All I do is sleep.  I'm tired.  I have no\n5 energy to do anything.  I have such bone and muscle\n6 pain that I can't even do -- I have a problem with\n7 my arm.  I can't even do curl-ups.  I was doing\n8 curl-ups.  I was doing lightweight -- lightweight\n9 workouts with the weights.\n10 Q.     Uh-huh.\n11 A.     I can't -- I can't curl, man, because I have\n12 developed a rash.  There's a rash right there, you\n13 know?  This has been there four months, and they\n14 tried every cream possible, and they still can't\n15 get rid of it.  So now they have to do a biopsy of\n16 it.\n17 Q.     Okay.\n18 A.     So I'm getting rashes, you know, all\n19 different types of weird rashes that I've never had\n20 before.  But the bone pain in my knees when I'm\n21 sitting up -- if I get up from this chair, it's\n22 excruciating pain behind my knees, back here, my\n23 lower back, my -- my arms, my joints, and my\n24 shoulders and my elbows.  I'm just like I'm a\n25 walking -- it's horrible, man.  I was able to do\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 7 of 22\nPage 33\n1 all this stuff.  I was able to do push-ups before.\n2 I did push-ups before I even started the therapy\n3 with Frommer.\n4 Q.     Right.\n5 A.     And I was -- I was -- I was walking -- I\n6 could walk the whole yard.\n7 Q.     Right.\n8 A.     I can -- I walk now 15 minutes and my ankles\n9 starts -- starts hurting, like somebody -- like I\n10 sprained it.  I feel like I got a sprained ankle; I\n11 mean, a legitimate sprained ankle.  I can show you\n12 my ankles right there on my legs, right?\n13 Q.     Uh-huh.\n14 A.     Look at my legs, how swollen they are.  I\n15 mean, I didn't have that.  And I developed\n16 diabetes.  I didn't have diabetes in 2013, but I\n17 have it now.\n18 Q.     Okay.  When were you diagnosed with\n19 diabetes?\n20 A.     Well, I had prediabetes, like, about\n21 two years ago, and then they started me on insulin\n22 three times a day about a year and a half ago,\n23 approximately.  I'm not -- I can't give you the\n24 dates.\n25 Q.     Are you taking any oral medication?\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 8 of 22\nPage 34\n1 A.     I'm taking oral and injections.\n2 Q.     And injections?\n3 A.     I take insulin injections three times a day\n4 at 7, 5 -- at 7, 11 and 5.\n5 Q.     Okay.\n6 A.     And I take two -- three pills a day.  It's\n7 called Prandin.\n8 Q.     Okay.  And do you attribute having gotten\n9 diabetes to the -- anything having to do with\n10 treatment of your liver?\n11 A.     Well, there is literature saying that it can\n12 cause -- so I'm not a doctor.  I don't know.  I\n13 mean, you know, I can't tell you for sure, for\n14 certain, you know what I mean?  But there's\n15 literature that says that you can develop diabetes\n16 when you have cirrhosis, and I have stage 4\n17 cirrhosis.\n18 Q.     Okay.  You have been treated with direct\n19 acting antiviral agents now; is that right?\n20 A.     Right.\n21 Q.     And I think you completed the -- did you\n22 take --\n23 A.     The 12 weeks, yes.\n24 Q.     And you completed that in December?\n25 A.     December.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 9 of 22\nPage 35\n1 Q.     And --\n2 A.     Christmas was my -- was my last dose.\n3 Q.     Okay.  And what did you take, Harvoni?\n4 A.     Harvoni.\n5 Q.     Any other medication along with it or just\n6 Harvoni?\n7 A.     I was taking Ribavirin with it --\n8 Q.     Okay.\n9 A.     -- but my bilirubin because my liver being\n10 as bad as it is --\n11 Q.     Right.\n12 A.     -- my bilirubin shot up to 6.7.\n13 Q.     Okay.\n14 A.     And my high norm is, like, 2-point\n15 something, and it's gone up as high as like 3-point\n16 something.  I have never seen 6.7 --\n17 Q.     So they took off Ribavirin --\n18 A.     They took me off Ribavirin, and I believe it\n19 got back down to 3.6, I believe.  From 6.7 to 3.6.\n20 Q.     That's why --\n21 A.     When I say 6.7, I'm like, whoa, because\n22 that's indicative of your liver shutting down.\n23 Q.     Right.  And you -- 12 weeks after you\n24 finished treatment, you ended up having a free\n25 viral load; isn't that right?\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 10 of 22\nPage 36\n1 A.     Right.  I had to wait three months to get\n2 the test.\n3 Q.     Right.\n4 A.     And they did the test, and it came up clean.\n5 Q.     Okay.\n6 A.     Now, Dr. Rabinowitz just repeated that.\n7 Q.     Did he?  Okay.\n8 A.     Yes.  He just ordered that, and he did an\n9 ammonia test.\n10 Q.     Right.\n11 A.     He took like 12 tubes of blood from me --\n12 Q.     Right.\n13 A.     -- that I haven't got -- I'm sure it's not\n14 here yet.\n15 Q.     All right.  So that's still pending?\n16 A.     Yes.\n17 Q.     Do you see -- do you go out to see\n18 Rabinowitz or do you see him in --\n19 A.     I went -- actually went to Pittsburgh.\n20 Q.     Just this week?\n21 A.     On Tuesday.\n22 Q.     Okay.\n23 A.     I believe -- I believe it was Tuesday.\n24 Q.     Okay.  And how frequently do you see\n25 Rabinowitz?\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 11 of 22\nPage 37\n1 A.     Well, last time I saw him was about\n2 ten months ago.\n3 Q.     Okay.\n4 A.     And now he wants to see me, again, in\n5 six months.\n6 Q.     Okay.\n7 A.     He wants to follow-up and, you know, we\n8 haven't discussed the lesion either on my -- on my\n9 liver.\n10 Q.     Right.\n11 A.     We haven't even discussed what that put me\n12 through.  Holy torture.  When the doctor told me I\n13 had cancer, I was crying.  I was emotionally\n14 distressed.\n15 Q.     Let's talk about that.  When did you find\n16 out that you had a lesion on your liver?\n17 A.     Okay.  I believe it was October.\n18 Q.     Of?  Just this past October or --\n19 A.     '16.  I can't remember the date for sure.\n20 Q.     I'm just trying to get a ballpark on how\n21 long ago --\n22 A.     It was either May or October, one of those\n23 months.\n24 Q.     Okay.\n25 A.     I can't remember.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 12 of 22\nPage 38\n1 Q.     Who told you --\n2 A.     Who told me -- Dr. Frommer -- they ordered a\n3 CT scan --\n4 Q.     Right.\n5 A.     Finally -- I finally got a CT scan that\n6 Dr. Kephart wouldn't do.  I said, it's been over a\n7 year.  I said, I'm due -- according to a specialist\n8 in Pittsburgh, he wrote the judge in my last\n9 lawsuit that I should get pictures of my liver\n10 taken every six months.\n11 Q.     Right.\n12 A.     Well, we're talking about 18 months maybe.\n13 And then I was saying -- telling Dr. Kephart, man,\n14 you know, I'm overdue for a CT scan.  You keep\n15 giving me ultrasounds and ultrasounds are not\n16 definitive --\n17 Q.     Right.\n18 A.     Because the ultrasounds I had right before\n19 the CT scan didn't show any mass.  So that's a\n20 telltale indicator that -- that the ultrasound\n21 wasn't showing anything.  As soon as I got the CT\n22 scan, it came back with two lesions, one on my\n23 back.  On my lower spine I had a spot that was\n24 suspicious and then I had this tumor --\n25 Q.     Lesion?\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 13 of 22\nPage 39\n1 A.     Liver lesion or, you know, whatever you want\n2 to call it.  The mass.  A mass I call it.  I had a\n3 mass in -- back here in my lower part, right next\n4 to the lung.\n5 Q.     Okay.\n6 A.     So I was called down into the office, down\n7 to the medical by Dr. Frommer.  He sits me down and\n8 he says, you have -- your results came back and you\n9 have hepatocellular cancer.\n10 Q.     So Dr. Frommer told you you have cancer?\n11 A.     That I have cancer --\n12 Q.     Okay.\n13 A.     -- and he should -- he should have been --\n14 he should have been completely sure before he gave\n15 me that bad news because I suffered, crying in my\n16 cell, you know, I was thinking I was going to die.\n17 You know, it was horrible.  And then he says, I\n18 want you to do a liver biopsy --\n19 Q.     Okay.\n20 A.     So -- this is exactly what he said, so we\n21 can determine what kind of cancer you have so we\n22 know the best treatment to give you for your\n23 cancer.\n24 Q.     Okay.\n25 A.     And that was the reason -- the purpose for\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 14 of 22\nPage 40\n1 the liver biopsy.\n2 Q.     Right.\n3 A.     So I called my doctor.\n4 Q.     Cecil?\n5 A.     Cecil.  He says, if you have hepatocellular\n6 cancer, you don't need a liver biopsy.  None of the\n7 doctors are doing it anymore.\n8 Q.     All right.\n9 A.     He said it's not necessary.  It's a high\n10 risk of what they call seeding, spreading the\n11 cancer, and you can bleed out, okay?  So I told\n12 doctor -- I refused the first time they tried --\n13 attempted to take me out to do this biopsy.  I\n14 said, I was scared.  And even Dr. Agra that worked\n15 here --\n16 Q.     Right.\n17 A.     -- even he said he was against me doing a\n18 biopsy and he's a retired surgeon.  Even Dr. Agra\n19 wrote in his report that he didn't recommend me\n20 doing a liver biopsy because it's too dangerous,\n21 so...\n22 Q.     Dangerous for what reasons, bleeding or\n23 spreading the tumor --\n24 A.     For both.  He said I can bleed out.\n25 Q.     Okay.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 15 of 22\nPage 41\n1 A.     He said, I'm a surgeon.  I know -- you know,\n2 he said I wouldn't get it.  He went over\n3 Dr. Frommer's recommendation and told me --\n4 actually told me not to get it.\n5 Q.     Okay.\n6 A.     So I said, okay, I'm believing doctor --\n7 because Dr. Agra is a good doctor.  Dr. Agra is an\n8 excellent doctor, in fact.  He knew -- he knew his\n9 stuff.  You know, he knew.  You know, he knew.  But\n10 I refused the first time.  The second time, they\n11 wanted me to come back here with no overnight\n12 clothes.  So they called me up here to medical to\n13 spend the night in medical.  They said, I think you\n14 should spend the night in medical.  It's like they\n15 make sure you don't eat or drink --\n16 Q.     Right, right.\n17 A.     You know, it's like a precaution.  I said,\n18 well, let me go back and my stuff.  Oh, no, no, you\n19 can't go back to the block now.  I said, what?  I\n20 said, I've got no clean underwear, no cosmetics, no\n21 nothing.  I said, I'm not doing it.  I said, I\n22 refuse.\n23 Q.     Okay.\n24 A.     So I went back to the block.  Now the third\n25 time, I -- I agreed to go.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 16 of 22\nPage 42\n1 Q.     Right.  Tell me -- tell us about that time.\n2 A.     That time?\n3 Q.     Where did you --\n4 A.     I went to Altoona -- UPMC Altoona, and I saw\n5 this Dr. James, I believe it was.  This was all --\n6 this is all --\n7 Q.     It's in the records.  I just wanted to know\n8 what you remember.\n9 A.     I just went over this last night.  I was\n10 reading my grievance, and I mentioned all five\n11 doctors that I saw, all five radiologists who gave\n12 different opinions.  Each one of them except for\n13 two that were on the same -- the same, you know --\n14 what's the word I'm looking for -- were in\n15 agreement.\n16 Q.     Right.\n17 A.     Two doctors were in agreement, that it was\n18 a -- that it was cancer.\n19 Q.     Okay.\n20 A.     Okay?  Now, the first doctor who did the CT\n21 scan, he wrote down that I had suspected carcinoma;\n22 you know, hepatic carcinoma.  And that's when I go\n23 down to get the biopsy.  So I go to Altoona, and I\n24 see a Dr. James, and he reviewed my CT scans and\n25 ultrasounds.  He comes back into the room, he says,\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 17 of 22\nPage 43\n1 we're not going to do the biopsy.  He says, because\n2 I don't believe it's -- I don't believe it's\n3 cancer.  I said, awe, man, I was so happy.  Here,\n4 the whole time I'm thinking I've got cancer and\n5 they wanted to do this so they could find out the\n6 best treatment for me.\n7        That's all it was about.  Boy, I was so\n8 upset with Dr. Frommer, man, telling me that I had\n9 cancer.  You don't know how many -- how many weeks\n10 I suffered, man, thinking about this.  Literally\n11 crying like a baby in my cell.  Someone came by my\n12 cell, said, you all right?  They told my sergeant\n13 on the block to check on me --\n14 Q.     Uh-huh.\n15 A.     -- after I got the news because I was like\n16 livid by the news, you know?\n17        So Dr. James comes in and tells me that day\n18 it was a hemangioma --\n19 Q.     Right.\n20 A.     -- which is a gathering of blood vessels --\n21 Q.     And you might bleed, right?\n22 A.     Yeah.  And so he recommended that I have red\n23 blood tags, a flagged red blood cell, like a\n24 nuclear test --\n25 Q.     Right.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 18 of 22\nPage 44\n1 A.     So it can weed-out the hemangioma.  So I had\n2 that done about four weeks later.  I had that done\n3 approximately four weeks later.\n4 Q.     Right.\n5 A.     And it came back negative for hemangioma.\n6 Q.     Uh-huh.\n7 A.     Now, the next doctor who I saw, he went\n8 for -- for that I got the red blood cell, I\n9 think --\n10 Q.     Uh-huh.\n11 A.     He -- he wrote that he thinks I had cancer.\n12 Q.     Right.\n13 A.     I forget his name.  I think it was Kuzukele,\n14 Kuzukel, something like that.\n15 Q.     It doesn't matter.  As long as we get --\n16 what you remember and the sequence.\n17 A.     Right.  And he recommended another MRI -- or\n18 a CT scan it was, to get to -- to delineate the --\n19 what it actually is.\n20 Q.     Right.\n21 A.     What this mass actually is, to delineate --\n22 I don't know if I'm saying it right.\n23 Q.     Delineate, I think, is what you're --\n24 A.     Delineate.\n25 Q.     Yeah.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 19 of 22\nPage 45\n1 A.     Delineate is what it was.  And so I go back,\n2 again, to get another biopsy.  He recommended a\n3 biopsy --  he recommended a biopsy, so I go back\n4 and I get another biopsy.  And this Dr. Shivers\n5 comes out and says, I'm not doing the biopsy\n6 because he thinks it's a hepatic -- no, an arterial\n7 venous -- arteriovenous fistula.\n8 Q.     Right.\n9 A.     And he told me that if he stuck that with a\n10 needle, it would be like hitting a major artery.\n11 Q.     Right.\n12 A.     I would definitely bleed out.  And he said\n13 the location of the -- of the mass is right next to\n14 the lung because they also hit the lung, and my\n15 lung will collapse during the procedure.  I'm not\n16 doing it.  So that's -- and then I forget who came\n17 next.\n18        So he sends me out for another CT, and it\n19 wasn't an arterial fistula.  I think at that\n20 point -- I wish I had -- I can refer to notes or --\n21 Q.     Let's just go from what you remember, but I\n22 understand.\n23 A.     All right.  And Dr. Shivers, he said that he\n24 recommends against the biopsy.  So now I have all\n25 these different diagnoses.  This doctor that it was\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 20 of 22\nPage 46\n1 cancer, this other doctor thought it was a cancer,\n2 now this doctor thinks it's a fistula.  So I said,\n3 look, he had this.  I had a meeting with Dr.\n4 Frommer and I made sure all these other doctors\n5 were in the room.  Even the doctor, psychiatrist\n6 was in the room, and we discussed my current\n7 condition in this room, this conference room.  And\n8 I said, well, look, man, I says, it only makes\n9 sense that I should be sent to a hepatologist.  Let\n10 them decide what this mass is, you know.\n11        So doctor -- and everybody in the room, I\n12 believe -- I think Mr. Hartman was in the room as\n13 well.  Even Mr. Hartman was in agreement with my\n14 requests to see the hepatologist at UPMC because\n15 they have a contract -- UPMC has a contract with\n16 the prison, you know.  And I've heard a lot of good\n17 things about their hepatology because that's where\n18 I saw my last doctor with the other lawsuit,\n19 doctor -- what was his name?\n20        Dr. Abenar -- A-B, Abenar.  He was appointed\n21 to Judge Bananski (phonetic).  He was his appointed\n22 specialist, and he's the one that recommended that\n23 I should get studies of my -- pictures of my liver\n24 every six months and that I should be evaluated if\n25 my MELD score goes up to 11, and I'm qualified to\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 21 of 22\nPage 47\n1 be evaluated.  He has this all in his report which\n2 is in the other lawsuit.  You still have his\n3 recommendations to the judge.  This is the judge's\n4 specialist, not mine.  So I said to him, I said --\n5 I told him, I said, why can't I be sent to UPMC and\n6 let me be evaluated by their hepatologist and to\n7 get a recommendation for -- to be treated with\n8 Harvoni?  So he puts in a recommendation, doctor --\n9 he says, I'll e-mail Mr. -- Dr. Noel or Dr. Shaw, I\n10 believe.  It was one of them two.\n11 Q.     And who said that, Frommer?\n12 A.     Frommer.  He said, I'm going to e-mail him\n13 and tell him to send you to Pittsburgh to be\n14 evaluated by a hepatologist.  He was in agreement\n15 to what I was saying because I got all these -- he\n16 was so, like, adamant about me getting this biopsy,\n17 and it could have killed me, you know what I mean?\n18 And he wrote -- he didn't write a referral.  He\n19 wrote my request.  Mr. Chimenti's requesting.  I\n20 said, I thought you were going to write me a\n21 recommendation for me to the central office, and he\n22 didn't do that.  I was kind of ticked off.\n23 Two weeks later, he calls me down and Ms. -- I\n24 believe Ms. -- who is it -- Ms. Cutshaw, okay.\n25 Debbie Cutshaw was in there, and they both sat me\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-21   Filed 11/02/17   Page 22 of 22\nPage 48\n1 down and they said, listen, I e-mailed your request\n2 to be sent to Pittsburgh.  Your request was denied.\n3 Q.     By who; do you know?\n4 A.     By Dr. Noel or Dr. Cowan.  I don't know, I\n5 think it's Noel.  I think it was Noel.  He told me,\n6 and I said, what, so now what?  You know, he says,\n7 I don't know.  I said, what about -- and they never\n8 even mentioned the Harvoni.  They didn't even bring\n9 that up, Harvoni.  And I was so upset, I forgot to\n10 ask him what about Harvoni because I had such a\n11 distaste in my mouth.\n12 Q.     Well, it wasn't very much long after that,\n13 though, that you didn't go to the UPMC people;\n14 isn't that right?\n15 A.     I think this meeting took place sometime, I\n16 believe, maybe like --\n17 Q.     I mean, it was months?\n18 A.     Yeah, months, several months.\n19 Q.     Okay.\n20 A.     You know, I saw a doctor.  Well, during the\n21 visit -- this was March, April, June, July -- July,\n22 maybe like five months later.\n23 Q.     Do you know how it was that that -- I mean,\n24 you were told you can't go see the UPMC\n25 hepatologist, and then just a few months later, you\n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-22   Filed 11/02/17   Page 1 of 12\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT S \n \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 101-22   Filed 11/02/17   Page 2 of 12\nChimenti v.

The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC), by policy and practice, \nsystemically denies necessary medical care for inmates diagnosed with Hepatitis C viral \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 2 of 21\ninfections, thereby placing them at substantial and unnecessary risk for severe illness, injury and \ndeath.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated \nplaintiffs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state laws against the DOC, prison officials, and \nmedical providers for depriving them of their rights guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution and Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n2.  Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, Daniel Leyva, and David Maldonado are \nincarcerated in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections with serious health complications \nstemming from their Hepatitis C viral infection.  The DOC and other Defendants have refused to \nprovide medical treatment to Plaintiffs and others incarcerated in the DOC with Hepatitis C \ninfections that is consistent with current and prevailing medical standards, as reflected in \nrecommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public and \nprivate medical providers including the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  As a result, the DOC \nand other Defendants have denied Plaintiffs and others similarly situated access to necessary and \nproper medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment and state law. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Eighth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.

At all relevant time, Defendant \nLehman has acted and will act under the color of state law. \nFACTS \nThe Hepatitis C Epidemic \n22.  Hepatitis C is a viral infection, primarily spread through contact with infected \nblood that attacks the liver and causes hepatitis, or liver inflammation, which can significantly \nimpair the liver’s ability to assist the body in digesting essential nutrients, filter toxins from the \nblood, and prevent disease. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 7 of 21\n23.  Hepatitis C infections are of multiple genotypes and can be of an acute or chronic \nnature.  An acute infection, a short-term illness, occurs within the first six (6) months of \nexposure to the virus and, for many people, it leads to chronic Hepatitis C infection.  \n24.  Chronic Hepatitis C infections are serious, long-term illnesses that can last \nthroughout a person’s life. Hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of \nliver tissue) and liver cancer and is the most common cause of liver transplants. Chronic \nHepatitis C infection can also cause serious chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis (scarring of liver \ntissue), and death. \n25.  Cirrhosis of the liver can cause symptoms such as swelling, increased likelihood \nof bruising, jaundice, itching, nausea, and problems with concentration and memory. \n26.  Hepatitis C infections occur upon transmission of blood from a person infected \nwith Hepatitis C to another person. The major means of transmission are the sharing of \nequipment for injecting drugs; tattooing or piercing; through needle-stick injuries; being born to \na mother with Hepatitis C; transfusion with infected blood or blood products; and by sexual \ncontact with a person infected with Hepatitis C.  \n27.  Each day without treatment increases the likelihood of cirrhosis, fibrosis, liver \ncancer, the need for a liver transplant, complications from the disease, death from liver failure \ndue to chronic Hepatitis C infection, and the risk of transmitting Hepatitis C to others.  \n28.   Liver transplants are painful, carry a risk of significant complications, and are \nnearly impossible for prisoners to obtain.  Transplants result in lower recovery rates than \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs, and transplants are very costly.  \n29.  By not providing necessary medical care, Defendants’ action threaten Plaintiffs \nand those similarly situated with death and other irreparable harm stemming from their Hepatitis \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 8 of 21\nC infections. Plaintifsf and members of the proposed class have suffered and will continue to \nsuffer grave and irreparable harm unless the Court orders Defendants to provide the safe and \neffective treatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs as described below.  \n30.  On information and belief, about 20 percent of inmates under the supervision of \nthe DOC are currently infected with Hepatitis C.   \n31.  The CDC recommends that persons with an increased risk for Hepatitis C \ninfection be tested. This includes, but is not limited to, persons born from 1945-1965; persons \nwho have injected illegal drugs; persons who received blood, blood products, or transplants \nbefore 1992; persons with an HIV infection; persons born to a positive mother infected with \nhepatitis C; and any persons with known exposure to the virus.  \nStandard of Care for Hepatitis C Infections \n32.  For many years, finding and establishing an effective and safe treatment for \nHepatitis C infections was a highly elusive goal.  The standard treatment, which included the use \nof interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure large numbers of patients and was \nassociated with painful and other adverse side-effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune \ndisorders, flulike symptoms, and gastrointestinal distress.  \n33.  Over the past three years, the approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) \nof new direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAD) has greatly improved the treatment module for \nHepatitis C infections. \n34.  In 2011, the FDA approved the use of protease inhibitors called boceprevir (under \nbrand name Vicrtrelis) and telaprevir (under brand name Incivek), and the standard of care \ndeveloped into a “triple therapy” to include the combination of either boceprevir or telaprevir, \nplus ribavirin and interferon.  The triple therapy improved results for many patients, but \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 9 of 21\ncontinued to produce painful and adverse side effects, and the treatment duration could take 48 \nweeks to complete. \n35.  In 2013, the FDA approved DAAD medications called simeprevir (under brand \nname Olysio) and sofosbuvir (under brand names Sovaldi). At this time, the recommended \ntreatment was DAAD such as Solvadi combined with ribavirin, or with interferon, depending on \nthe patient’s other symptoms and medical diagnoses. \n36.  In late 2014, the FDA approved the use of Sovaldi in combination with Olsyio for \nthe treatment of Hepatitis C. \n37.  On October 10, 2014, the FDA specifically approved Harvoni, a pill that is taken \nonce a day and combines sofosbuvir and ledipasvir.  \n38.  Harvoni eliminates the need for the patient to take interferon and/or ribavirin, \nwhich were largely responsible for the adverse and difficult side-effects of treating Hepatitis C.  \n39.  Solvaldi (sofosbuvir), Olysio (simeprevir), and Harvoni have few side effects, \ngreater efficacy, can reduce treatment durations by 75 percent, and are administered orally rather \nthan by injections. \n40.  The new treatment modules utilizing these newest DAAD have very high cure \nrates (over 90% of patients treated for Solvaldi and over 95% for Harvoni), have fewer and far \nless serious side-effects than the previous treatment modules, and involve a far shorter treatment \ntime (12-24 weeks). \n41.  The standard of care in the community for Hepatitis C infections—the use of the \nlatest DAAD—is now well-established.  The CDC has recommended these new treatment \nmodules and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), in 2014, adopted new Clinical Practice \nGuidelines that incorporate these new DAAD treatment modules.  Under the CDC and the BOP \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 10 of 21\nguidelines, the recommended treatment depends further upon the particularized genotype, the \nacute or chronic status of the disease, and prior attempts to treat the patient’s Hepatitis C \ninfection.    \n42.  On information and belief, correctional systems in California, Illinois, \nWashington, Wisconsin, Oregon, and New York have also developed procedures to provide \nDAADs to individuals that fall within their guidelines, and have started prescribing these \nlifesaving medications to certain prisoners. \nPennsylvania DOC Policy for Hepatitis C Infections \n43.  Defendants have not implemented treatment policies or provided medical \ntreatment for Hepatitis C infections consistent with current medical and community standards \nand specifically have not authorized treatment with the effective direct-acting antiviral drugs.   \n44.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have ceased providing any treatment to \ninmates with Hepatitis C infections, including the combination therapy of interferon and \nribavirin, or the triple therapy of boceprevir/telaprevir with interferon and ribavirin. \n45.  Contrary to the proper and necessary medical procedures and the community \nstandard of care, Defendants have denied requests by Plaintiffs Chimenti, Levya, Maldonado, \nand by other members of the class for the appropriate and medically necessary direct-acting \nantiviral treatment for their Hepatitis C infections. \n46.  The DOC subcontracts its medical care to private medical care companies, but \nalso employs medical care professionals, including correctional health care administrators, at \neach institution. \n47.  Upon information and belief, the Bureau of Health Care Services (BHCS) is a \nbureau within the DOC that provides oversight of medical care services to DOC inmates. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 11 of 21\n48.  Individuals seeking medical treatment for their Hepatitis C infections have merely \nbeen informed that the “DOC/BHCS is revaluating [their] treatment protocol for Hepatitis C \ngiven the new guidance issued by the American Association of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the \nInfectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA).” \n49.  In the meanwhile, Plaintiffs and all class members have not received the \nnecessary medical treatment for Hepatitis C, including the latest DAAD such as Solvaldi \n(sofosbuvir), Olysio (simeprevir) or Harvoni (sofosbuvir with ledipasvir). \n50.  As a consequence of this policy, Plaintiffs and all class members with Hepatitis C \ninfections have a substantially increased risk of continued Hepatitis C infection, liver disease, \nliver cancer, cirrhosis, and death. \n51.  There is no medical justification for a treatment module for Hepatitis C infection \nthat does not utilize the direct-acting antiviral drugs such as simeprevir (Olysio) and sofosbuvir \n(Solvaldi) or sofosbuvir with ledipasvir (combined as Harvoni).  To the extent that the direct-\nacting antiviral treatment has not been instituted because of financial considerations, such \nconcerns are unconstitutional and are otherwise in violation of the United States Constitution, the \nPennsylvania Constitution, and Pennsylvania state law as they deny necessary and appropriate \nmedical care to Plaintiff and members of the class. \n \nPlaintiff Salvatore Chimenti \n52.  Mr. Chimenti entered the DOC in 1983, and is currently incarcerated at SCI \nSmithfield. \n53.  In 1991, while Mr. Chimenti was housed at SCI Huntingdon, the medical staff \ninformed Mr. Chimenti that he had tested positive for Hepatitis C.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 12 of 21\n54.  Mr. Chimenti received interferon treatments from December 1, 1997 to March 18, \n1998, but these treatments did not provide a cure for the disease.  \n55.  In May 1998, a gastrointestinal specialist, Michael F. Gaugler, D.O., \nrecommended consideration of  a treatment module for Mr. Chimenti of interferon in \ncombination with ribavirin, and that treatment module was approved by the FDA in or about \nJune 1998. \n56.  The DOC took 18 months to develop a protocol from 1998 to 2000, and therefore, \nMr. Chimenti did not begin the combination treatment with interferon and ribavirin (combined \ntogether and branded as Rebetron) until June 2000, but once again his condition did not improve \nwith this six-month treatment.  \n57.  During this time while waiting for the Rebetron treatment for Hepatitis C, Mr. \nChimenti’s condition deteriorated from Stage 3 to Stage 4 cirrhosis, thus reducing his chance of \nresponding positively to that treatment by 50 percent. \n58.  In 2011, after FDA approved a triple therapy treatment using boceprevir or \ntelaprevir in combination with interferon and ribavirin, Mr. Chimenti again sought to have his \nHepatitis C treated. \n59.  After waiting 10 months, Mr. Chimenti was treated with triple therapy at SCI \nForest from June 2012 through May 2013.  He initially responded positively to the triple therapy, \nbut relapsed six months later in November 2013. \n60.  Mr. Chimenti now suffers from Stage 4 compensated cirrhosis with chronic liver \nfailure.  His Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (“MELD”) score is 12.  The MELD score is a \nmeasure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and is used as a disease severity \nindex to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 13 of 21\n61.  In 2009, Dr. Abhinav Humar, Chief Liver Transplant Specialist from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center was appointed by U.S. District Court Judge Vanaskie to \nprovide a report on Mr. Chimenti’s medical condition.  Dr. Humar recommended that Mr. \nChimenti be assessed with ultrasounds and CT scans of his liver every six months, and that if \nMr. Chimenti’s “MELD” score went above 10, that he be evaluated by a hepatologist for the \npossibility of a liver transplant. \n62.  Since November 2013, Defendants, including Dr. Kephart, have denied the \nnecessary treatment to track and halt the deleterious effects of Hepatitis C, including regular \nultrasounds and CT scans, which are medically necessary for individuals with Stage 4 cirrhosis. \n63.  Defendants, including Defendants Dancha, Dreibelbis, Kephart, Correct Care \nSolutions, Wexford Health Source, and Lehman, failed with deliberate indifference to have Mr. \nChimenti seen or evaluated by a hepatologist or  a gastroenterologist for proper treatment of his \nliver condition. \n64.  In late 2013, Mr. Chimenti began requesting treatment of his Hepatitis C infection \nwith direct-acting antiviral drugs, but he has been denied this treatment by Defendants, even \nthough the standard of community care at that time required that Mr. Chimenti be prescribed \nSolvadi with ribavirin, which has an over 90% cure rate. \n65.  In November 2014, CHCA Dreibelbis informed Mr. Chimenti that the “PA DOC \nhas not approved the use of [Harvoni] at this time.  Thus it is not offered at this facility.” \n66.  Despite Mr. Chimenti having stage 4 cirrhosis, the most advanced stage, he has \nyet to be referred to a hepatologist for a full evaluation since he has been returned to SCI \nSmithfield. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 14 of 21\n67.  Mr. Chimenti has fully grieved the denial of his request for this form of medical \ntreatment, as well as the lack of any treatment for his Hepatitis C or cirrhosis. \n68.  As a result of Defendants’ denial of the necessary medical treatment, Mr. \nChimenti continues to suffer from chronic Hepatitis C infection and the related risks of liver \nfailure and death, and physical and emotional pain and suffering. \n69.  Due to Mr. Chimenti’s advanced cirrhosis and the deterioration of his liver, \nmedical treatment for his Hepatitis C is urgently needed. Once Mr. Chimenti’s liver \ndecompensates, the only treatment for him would be a liver transplant. \n70.  The refusal, with deliberate indifference, of Defendants to provide Mr. Chimenti \nand other class members with Hepatitis C infections with access to the necessary and appropriate \nDAAD and other medical services for the treatment of their Hepatitis C infections constitutes a \nviolation of the Eight Amendment, the Pennsylvania Constitution, and Pennsylvania state law. \nPlaintiff Daniel Leyva \n71.  Plaintiff Daniel Leyva is currently incarcerated at SCI Retreat. \n72.  Mr. Leyva was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2001 or 2002 while he was \nincarcerated at SCI Albion. \n73.  Previously he had been treated with interferon and ribavirin, but it was \nunsuccessful in treating his Hepatitis C infection. \n74.  Mr. Leyva has Hepatitis genotype 1 and recent lab results show that he has \nelevated or high levels of the Hepatitis C virus. \n75.  Mr. Leyva requested to be provided the latest direct-acting antiviral drug \ntreatment, but the doctor informed him that it cost too much. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 15 of 21\n76.  Mr. Leyva filed a grievance requesting to be provided with the latest direct-acting \nantiviral drug treatment and fully exhausted his administrative remedies. \n77.  In the DOC response, Joseph Mataloni, Corrections Health Care Administrator at \nSCI Retreat, wrote, “The DOC is re-evaluating our treatment protocol for Hepatitis C given the \nnew guidance issued by the American Association of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the \nInfectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).” \n78.  Mr. Leyva also received a response from Christopher H. Oppman, Director, \nBureau of Health Care Services, who also informed him that the DOC and BCHS are re-\nevaluating their treatment protocol. \n79.  Mr. Leyva currently experiences symptoms of Hepatitis C, including pain, \nfatigue, and his eyes are jaundiced and requires immediate treatment to prevent any further liver \ndamage. \nPlaintiff David Maldonado \n80.  Plaintiff David Maldonado has been incarcerated in the DOC since 1980, and has \nbeen incarcerated at SCI Graterford since 1995. \n81.  Mr. Maldonado was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1997. \n82.  Mr. Maldonado was treated with interferon and ribavirin in 2001, but the \ntreatment was unsuccessful. \n83.  After undergoing a liver biopsy which revealed that Mr. Maldonado was between \nStage 1 and Stage 2 liver fibrosis, Mr. Maldonado was transferred to SCI Forest in June 2013 to \nreceive the triple therapy of interferon and ribavirin with boceprevir.  While there was some \ninitial success in reducing Mr. Maldonado’s viral load, the treatment failed after six months in \nDecember 2013. Mr. Maldonado returned to SCI Graterford in February 2014. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 16 of 21\n84.  Mr. Maldonado has requested the direct-acting antiviral drug treatment from the \nmedical staff and Medical Director Weiner, but was informed by the Bureau of Health Care \nServices that a new protocol was being developed. \n85.  Defendant Korszniak, CHCA at SCI Graterford, responded to Mr. Maldonado’s \ngrievance that, “The drug [Harvoni] that you mention has not yet been approved for use by the \nDOC, BHCS.  When the protols [sic] are extablished [sic] and the drug is approved there will be \nan assessment done to determine who will qualify for the treatment.” \n86.  In response to Mr. Maldonado’s appeal of his grievance to the Central Office, he \nwas informed, “The DOC/BHCS is re-evaluating our treatment protocol for Hepatitis C given the \nnew guidance issued by the American Association of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases \nSociety of America.” \n87.  Mr. Maldonado’s fibrosis requires immediate treatment to prevent any further \nliver damage or liver failure. \n88.  Mr. Maldonado filed grievances requesting to be provided proper medical \ntreatment for Hepatitis C, including the latest direct-acting antiviral drug treatment, and has fully \nexhausted his administrative remedies. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n89.  Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action on behalf of himself and all others \nsimilarly situated (the “Class”) pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n90.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class on claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief: \nAll persons who are currently incarcerated in a Pennsylvania Department of \nCorrections facility who have at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to \nserve on their sentences and are either currently diagnosed with Hepatitis C \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 17 of 21\ninfection and/or are determined to have Hepatitis C infection after a blood test \nadministered by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. \n \n91.  As a result of Defendants’ deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of \nthe Class, members of the Class are or will be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and \ndeprived of their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ illegal and unconstitutional actions, policies, and \npractices. \n92.  The requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) are satisfied by this class action. \n93.  The information as to the size of the Class and the identity of the inmates who are \nin the Class is in the exclusive control of Defendants. On information and belief, the class \nencompasses thousands of inmates in the Pennsylvania DOC, who are geographically dispersed \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The number of persons who are members of the \nClass described above are so numerous that joinder of all members in one action is \nimpracticable. \n94.  Questions of law and fact that are common to the entire Class predominate over \nindividual questions because the actions of Defendants complained of herein were generally \napplicable to the entire class. These legal and factual questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  Whether the treatment regimens utilizing the direct acting antiviral drugs \nare the proper, necessary and standard course of treatment in the medical \ncommunity; \nb.  Whether denial of treatment regimens utilizing the direct-acting antiviral \ndrugs to the Class will cause injury to the Class members, including \nunnecessary pain and suffering, chronic illness, and death; \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 18 of 21\nc.  Whether Defendants’ Hepatitis C current treatment policy, which denies \nnecessary pharmaceutical treatment for inmates with Hepatitis C \ninfections by following outdated and ineffective treatment regimens or not \nproviding any treatment regimens at all, violates the Eighth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution and Article I § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n95.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the Class because Plaintiffs and \nall Class Members were injured by the same wrongful policy and practices of Defendants as \ndescribed in this Complaint. Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same practices and course of \nconduct that give rise to the claims of the Class members, and are based on the same legal \ntheories. \n96.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the Class they seek to represent. \nPlaintiffs are represented by competent and skilled counsel whose interests are fully aligned with \nthe interests of the Class. \n97.  Relief concerning Plaintiffs’ rights under the laws herein alleged and with respect \nto the Class would be proper. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with regard to Class Members as a whole and certification of the Class under \nRule 23(b)(2) proper. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nDeprivation of Eighth Amendment Right to Medical Care \n \n(against Defendants DOC, Wetzel, Noel, Oppman, Kephart, Dreibelbis, Weiner, Korszniak, \nCorrect Care Solutions, Scharff, Dancha, and Hochberg). \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 1   Filed 06/12/15   Page 19 of 21\n98.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \nSALVATORE CHIMENTI, ET AL.  :    CIVIL ACTION \n  :   \nv.  :   \n  :   \nPENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT  :   \nOF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.  :    NO.  15-3333 \n \nMEMORANDUM \nPadova, J.  March 21, 2016 \n  Plaintiffs have brought this class action lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Department of \nCorrections (the “DOC”), two companies that have contracted to provide medical services for the \nDOC, and officials and employees of both the DOC and the two companies, asserting claims \narising from the medical care provided to DOC inmates who have been diagnosed with Hepatitis \nC.  Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss brought by the DOC and officials and employees \nthereof (the “DOC Defendants”) and a Motion to Dismiss or Sever brought by the medical care \nproviders and their officials and employees (the “Medical Defendants”).  For the following \nreasons, each Motion is granted in part and denied in part.  \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  The Complaint alleges the following facts.  Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, Daniel Leyva, \nand David Maldonado are all incarcerated in the DOC and all suffer from Hepatitis C viral \ninfections.  (Compl. ¶ 2.)  Chimenti is incarcerated at the Pennsylvania State Correctional \nInstitution at Smithfield (“SCI Smithfield”).  (Id. ¶ 5.)  Leyva is incarcerated at the Pennsylvania \nState Correctional Institution at Retreat (“SCI Retreat”).  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Maldonado is incarcerated at \nthe Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution at Graterford (“SCI Graterford”).  (Id. ¶ 7.)  \nDefendant Correct Care Solutions began providing health care services for DOC facilities on \n\nSeptember 1, 2014 and is the current health care provider for all DOC facilities.  (Id. ¶ 16.)  \nDefendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc. was the health care provider for all DOC facilities prior \nto September 1, 2014.  (Id. ¶ 20.) \n  Hepatitis C is primarily spread through the transmission of blood from a person infected \nwith the disease to another person.  (Id. 26.)  Hepatitis C attacks the liver and causes hepatitis \n(inflammation of the liver), “which can significantly impair the liver’s ability to assist the body \nin digesting essential nutrients, filter toxins from the blood, and prevent disease.”  (Id. ¶ 22.)  \nHepatitis C can be acute or chronic. (Id. ¶ 23.)  Acute Hepatitis C is a short-term illness that \noccurs within the first six months of exposure to the virus and can lead to chronic Hepatitis C.  \n(Id.)  Chronic Hepatitis C is a “long-term illness[] that can last throughout a person’s life” and is \n“the leading cause of cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of liver tissue) and liver cancer and is the \nmost common cause of liver transplants.”  (Id. ¶ 24.)  Chronic Hepatitis C can also lead to \nchronic liver disease, liver fibrosis, and death.  (Id.)  Approximately twenty percent of the \n“inmates under the supervision of the DOC are currently infected with Hepatitis C.”  (Id. ¶ 30.)   \n  In the past, the standard treatment for Hepatitis C infections, “which included the use of \ninterferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure large numbers of patients and was associated \nwith painful and other adverse side-effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune disorders, \nflulike symptoms, and gastrointestinal distress.”  (Id. ¶ 32.)  Over the past few years, the Federal \nDrug Administration (“FDA”) has approved new direct-acting antiviral drugs (“DAAD”) to treat \nHepatitis C infections.  (Id. ¶ 33.)  “In 2011, the FDA approved the use of protease inhibitors \ncalled boceprevir . . . and telaprevir . . . and the standard of care developed into a ‘triple therapy’ \nto include the combination of either boceprevir or telaprevir, plus ribavirin and interferon”  (Id. ¶ \n34.)  This new triple therapy improved results for many patients, but still led to “painful and \n2 \n \n\nadverse side effects,” and the treatment could last for as many as 48 weeks.  (Id.)  In 2013, the \nFDA  approved  two  new  DAAD  medications  called  simeprevir  (brand  name  Olysio)  and \nsofosbuvir  (brand  name  Sovaldi).    (Id.  ¶  35.)    The  recommended  treatment  became  a \ncombination of a “DAAD such as Sovaldi combined with ribavirin, or with interferon, depending \non the patient’s other symptoms and medical diagnoses.”  (Id.)  “In late 2014, the FDA approved \nthe use of Sovaldi in combination with Olysio for the treatment of Hepatitis C.”  (Id. ¶ 36.)  “On \nOctober 10, 2014, the FDA . . . approved Harvoni, a pill that is taken once a day and combines \nsofosbuvir and ledipasvir.”  (Id. ¶ 37.)  A patient who takes Harvoni does not need to take \ninterferon and/or ribavirin, the drugs “largely responsible for the adverse and difficult side-\neffects of treating Hepatitis C.”  (Id. ¶ 38.)  The new drugs, i.e., Solvaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, \nhave few side effects, have greater efficacy than older treatments for Hepatitis C, and can be \ntaken for significantly less time (75% less) than prior Hepatitis C treatments.  (Id. ¶ 39.)  Use of \nthe latest DAAD medications is now the standard of care in the community for the treatment of \nHepatitis C infections.  (Id. ¶ 41.)  “The CDC has recommended these new treatment modules \nand the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), in 2014, adopted new Clinical Practice Guidelines that \nincorporate these new DAAD treatment modules.”  (Id.)   \n  Defendants have not implemented these new treatment modules for the treatment of \nHepatitis C infections within the DOC.  (Id. ¶ 43.)  Rather, Defendants have “ceased providing \nany treatment to inmates with Hepatitis C infections, including the combination therapy of \ninterferon  and  ribavirin,  or  the  triple  therapy  of  boceprevir/telaprevir  with  interferon  and \nribavirin.”  (Id. ¶ 44.)  Defendants have denied requests by the Plaintiffs and others for DAAD \nmedications to treat their Hepatitis C infections.  (Id. ¶ 45.)   Inmates who seek medical treatment \nfor their Hepatitis C infections have been informed that the “DOC/BHCS is revaluating [their] \n3 \n \n\ntreatment protocol for Hepatitis C given the new guidance issued by the American Association of \nLiver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of American [sic] (IDSA).”1  (Id. ¶ \n48 (first alteration in original).)  Consequently, Plaintiffs and others “have not received the \nnecessary medical treatment for Hepatitis C, including the latest DAAD such as Solvaldi . . . , \nOlysio . . . , or Harvoni . . .” and “have a substantially increased risk of continued Hepatitis C \ninfection, liver disease, liver cancer, cirrhosis, and death.”  (Id. ¶¶ 49-50.)  \n  Chimenti was first diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1991.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  He has received \ndifferent treatments from the DOC since that time, but has not been cured and currently suffers \nfrom “Stage 4 compensated cirrhosis with chronic liver failure.”  (Id. ¶¶ 54-60.)  Most recently, \nChimenti was treated with the triple therapy at SCI Forest from June 2012 through May 2013.  \n(Id. ¶ 59.)  While he initially responded positively to the triple therapy, he relapsed after six \nmonths, in November 2013.  (Id.)  In late 2013, he began requesting treatment with DAAD \nmedications, but Defendants have denied that treatment, even though treatment of Hepatitis C \nwith Solvadi and ribavirin has an over 90% cure rate.  (Id. ¶ 64.)  Chimenti has also asked to be \ntreated with Harvoni, but, in November 2014, Defendant William Dreibelbis, a Correctional \nHealth Care Administrator (“CHCA”) at SCI Smithfield, informed Chimenti that “‘PA DOC has \nnot approved the use of [Harvoni] at this time.  Thus it is not offered at this facility.’”  (Id. ¶¶ 13, \n65 (alteration in original).)   \n  Leyva was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2001 or 2002, while he was incarcerated at SCI \nAlbion.  (Id. ¶ 72.)  He has been treated with interferon and ribavirin, but those drugs did not \ncure his infection.  (Id. ¶ 73.)  He has asked to be treated with the latest DAAD treatment, but \nwas informed by his doctor that the treatment is too costly.  (Id. ¶ 75.)  Joseph Mataloni, the \n                                                 \n  1 The Bureau of Health Care Services (“BHCS”), a bureau within the DOC, oversees the \nprovision of medical care to DOC inmates.  (Id. ¶ 47.)   \n4 \n \n\nCHCA at SCI Retreat, informed Leyva that “‘[t]he DOC is re-evaluating our treatment protocol \nfor Hepatitis C given the new guidance issued by the American Association of Liver Diseases \n(AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).’”  (Id. ¶ 77.)  He was also \ninformed by Christopher H. Oppman, Director of BHCS, that “DOC and BCHS are re-evaluating \ntheir treatment protocol.”  (Id. ¶ 78.) \n  Maldonado was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1997.  (Id. ¶ 81.)  He was unsuccessfully \ntreated with interferon and ribavirin in 2001.  (Id. ¶ 82.)  In June 2013, he was treated with the \ntriple therapy of interferon, ribavirin and boceprevir.  (Id. ¶ 83.)  This treatment was initially \nsuccessful, but failed after six months in December 2013.  (Id.)  He has asked to be treated with \nthe latest DAAD treatment, but was informed by BHCS that a new protocol is being developed.  \n(Id. ¶ 84.)  Defendant Joseph C. Korszniak, the CHCA at SCI Graterford, informed Maldonado \nthat Harvoni “‘has not yet been approved for use by the DOC, BHCS.  When the protols [sic] are \nextablished [sic] and the drug is approved there will be an assessment done to determine who \nwill qualify for the treatment.’”  (Id. ¶ 85 (alterations in original).)   \n  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all persons currently incarcerated in a DOC facility \nwho have at least twelve weeks remaining in their sentences and are currently diagnosed with \nHepatitis C.  (Id. ¶ 90.)  They assert four claims for relief.  Count One asserts a claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the DOC Defendants, Correct Care Solutions, and employees of \nCorrect Care Solutions for deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners \ninfected  with  Hepatitis  C  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution.  Count Two asserts a claim against the DOC Defendants, Correct Care Solutions, \nand employees of Correct Care Solutions for deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs \nof prisoners infected with Hepatitis C in violation of Article I, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania \n5 \n \n\nConstitution.  Count III asserts a claim against all Defendants for medical malpractice under \nPennsylvania law.  Count IV asserts a claim against Wexford Health and Correct Care Solutions \nfor medical malpractice and vicarious liability under Pennsylvania law. \nII.  THE DOC DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \nThe DOC Defendants seek dismissal of Count I of the Complaint as against four of the \nDOC Defendants named in that Count for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  They also seek dismissal of \nCounts II and III in their entireties pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  In addition, the DOC Defendants \nask us to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety for improper venue pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(3). \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nWhen considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we “consider only the \ncomplaint,  exhibits  attached  to  the  complaint,  [and]  matters  of  public  record,  as  well  as \nundisputedly authentic documents if the complainant’s claims are based upon these documents.” \nMayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. \nWhite Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)).  We take the factual allegations \nof the complaint as true and “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” \nDelRio-Mocci v. Connolly Props., Inc., 672 F.3d 241, 245 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Warren Gen. \nHosp. v. Amgen, Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011)).  Legal conclusions, however, receive no \ndeference, as the court is “‘not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \nallegation.’”  Wood v. Moss, 134 S. Ct. 2056, 2065 n.5 (2014) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009)). \n6 \n \n\nA plaintiff’s pleading obligation is to set forth “a short and plain statement of the claim,” \nwhich gives “‘the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it \nrests.’”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (alteration in original) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  The complaint must \ncontain “‘sufficient factual matter to show that the claim is facially plausible,’ thus enabling ‘the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for [the] misconduct alleged.’”  \nWarren Gen. Hosp., 643 F.3d at 84 (quoting Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d \nCir. 2009)).  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for \nmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 \n(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). ).  “A complaint that pleads facts ‘merely consistent with a \ndefendant’s liability . . . stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement \nto relief.’”  Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 786-87 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Iqbal, \n556 U.S. at 678).  “The plausibility determination is ‘a context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.’”  Id. at 786 (quoting \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 679).  In the end, we will grant a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) if the factual allegations in the complaint are not sufficient “‘to raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level.’”  W. Run Student Hous. Assocs., LLC v. Huntington Nat’l Bank, \n712 F.3d 165, 169 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). \nB.  Count I \nCount I asserts an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 against twelve of the Defendants, including all six of the DOC Defendants:  the DOC; \nJohn  Wetzel,  the  Secretary  of  the  DOC;  Paul  Noel,  Chief  Medical  Director  of  the  DOC; \nOppman; Dreibelbis; and Korszniak.  The DOC Defendants have moved to dismiss this Count as \n7 \n \n\nagainst Wetzel, Noel, Dreibelbis, and Korszniak pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that the \nComplaint  does  not  allege  that  these  Defendants  were  personally  involved  in  the  alleged \nviolation of Plaintiffs’ rights. \n  Section 1983 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe  subjected,  any  citizen  of  the  United  States  or  other  person  within  the \njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “Section 1983 provides remedies for deprivations of rights established in the \nConstitution or federal laws.  It does not, by its own terms, create substantive rights.”  Kaucher v. \nCty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted) (citing Baker v. McCollan, \n443 U.S. 137, 145 n.3 (1979)).  Consequently, in order to state a claim for relief pursuant to § \n1983, “a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived him \nor her of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.” Id. (citing Am. \nMfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49–50 (1999), and Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 \nF.3d 1137, 1141 (3d Cir. 1995)). \n  Count I alleges that the twelve named Defendants’ “acts and omissions in failing to \nprovide adequate medical care constitute a deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of \nprisoners infected with Hepatitis C, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  \n(Compl. ¶ 99.)  The Eighth Amendment’s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, \nwhich applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 101-\n02 (citation omitted), “imposes duties on [prison] officials, who must . . . ensure that inmates \nreceive adequate . . . medical care, and must ‘take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of \nthe inmates.’”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 \n8 \n \n\nU.S. 517, 526–27 (1984)).  To state a claim under the Eighth Amendment for denial of medical \ncare, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant showed “deliberate indifference to serious \nmedical needs of [a] prisoner[ ].”  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104.  Courts have consistently held that \n“mere allegations of malpractice” are not sufficient to allege “deliberate indifference.”  Id. at 106 \nn.14. \n“Deliberate indifference can be shown by a prison official ‘intentionally denying or \ndelaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.’” \nRhines v. Bledsoe, 388 F. App’x 225, 227 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05). \n“A medical need is serious if it ‘has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one \nthat  is  so  obvious  that  a  lay  person  would  easily  recognize  the  necessity  for  a  doctor’s \nattention.’”  Id. (quoting Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d \nCir. 1987)).  Moreover, the medical need must be such that “‘a failure to treat can be expected to \nlead to substantial and unnecessary suffering, injury, or death.’”  Tsakonas v. Cicchi, 308 F. \nApp’x 628, 632 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 2023 (3d \nCir. 1991)).   \nA prison official acts with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need “when he \nknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.”  Brown v. Thomas, 172 F. \nApp'x 446, 450 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  “The official must be aware of \nthe facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, \nand he must also draw the inference.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Given these prerequisites to a valid \nconstitutional claim based on deliberate indifference,  factual allegations suggesting only an \n“‘ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner’s interests or safety’” will not suffice to meet the \n9 \n \n\npleading requirements for deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer, 511 \nU.S. at 835 (quoting Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986)). \nThe DOC Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to plead a cognizable § 1983 claim \nagainst Wetzel, Noel, Dreibelbis and Korszniak because it does not allege any facts that, if true, \nwould establish that these Defendants were personally involved in denying medical treatment for \nthe Plaintiffs’ Hepatitis C infections.  “‘A[n individual government] defendant in a civil rights \naction must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongdoing; liability cannot be predicated \nsolely on the operation of respondeat superior. Personal involvement can be shown through \nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.”  Evancho v. Fisher, \n423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d \n1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)); see also Argueta v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 643 F.3d 60, \n72 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Rode, 845 F.2d at 1207) (same).  Thus, a conclusory allegation that \ndefendants were “directly involved” in the violations of the plaintiff’s rights is not sufficient to \nallege personal involvement.  Bush v. Dep’t of Human Servs., 614 F. App’x 616, 620 (3d Cir. \n2015) (affirming dismissal of § 1983 complaint against city officials where the only allegation of \npersonal involvement was the conclusory allegation that officials “were all ‘directly involved’” \nin the deprivation of plaintiff’s rights).  See also Wright v. Warden, Forest SCI, 582 F. App’x \n136, 137 (3d Cir. 2014) (affirming dismissal of § 1983 claim against prison officials where the \nallegations that those officials “had a ‘statutory duty to enforce policies’ and govern the ‘conduct \nof their subordinates’” failed to suggest the requisite personal involvement); Gorrell v. Yost, 509 \nF. App’x 114, 118 (3d Cir. 2013) (determining that allegation that mailroom officers were \n“responsible for the daily operations of the mail room” was “insufficient to establish personal \nliability” with respect to plaintiff’s claim regarding interference with his legal mail).   \n10 \n \n\nThe DOC Defendants argue that Count I must be dismissed as against Wetzel and Noel \nbecause  the  Complaint  does  not  allege  that  either  of  these  Defendants  had  any  personal \ninvolvement in treating Plaintiffs, denying Plaintiffs treatment for Hepatitis C,  or developing the \nDOC’s policies for treating Plaintiffs with Hepatitis C.  However, the Complaint specifically \nalleges that Wetzel, as the Secretary of the DOC, “is responsible for all the oversight, operation, \nand administration of the Commonwealth’s correctional system, including providing appropriate \nmedical treatment and the formulation of policies that ensure the provision of that treatment to \nPlaintiffs.”  (Compl. ¶ 9.)  We conclude that this allegation is sufficient to raise a reasonable \ninference of Wetzel’s personal involvement in the DOC’s policy of ceasing the provision of \nmedical treatment to inmates with Hepatitis C and denying their requests for treatment with \nDAADs (id. ¶¶ 43-51), and we further conclude that the Complaint states a cognizable § 1983 \nclaim against Wetzel for deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment.  See Barros v. Wetzel, Civ. A. No. 14-1746, 2015 WL 5785746, at \n*2, *4 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 29, 2015) (denying motion to dismiss § 1983 claim against Wetzel for \nviolation of plaintiff’s First Amendment free exercise of religion rights where the complaint \nalleged that Wetzel’s policy directive caused the infringement); Cook v. Corbett, Civ. A. No. 14–\n5895, 2015 WL  4111692, at *13 (E.D. Pa. July 8, 2015) (denying motion to dismiss § 1983 \nclaim  against  Wetzel  based  on  allegation  that  Wetzel  maintained  a  policy  that  resulted  in \nviolation of plaintiff’s First Amendment right to free exercise of religion); Stokes v. Riskus, Civ. \nA. No. 14-60, 2015 WL 1326200, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 24, 2015) (denying motion to dismiss § \n1983  claim  against  Wetzel  for  violation  of  the  plaintiff’s  Eighth  Amendment  right  to  be \nprotected  from assault  by other inmates where the complaint alleged  that Wetzel failed to \ndevelop  a  policy  that  would  “protect  inmates  from  assault  while  on  protective  custody”); \n11 \n \n\nHampton v. Wetzel, Civ. A. No. 12-434, 2014 WL 1312013, at *14 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2014) \n(denying  motion  for  summary  judgment  as  to  plaintiff’s  §  1983  claim  against  Wetzel  for \nviolation  of  plaintiff’s  Fourteenth  Amendment  right  to  equal  protection  where  the  record \ncontained evidence that Wetzel “had a role in establishing and maintaining the policy or practice \nwhich allegedly resulted in differential treatment of [plaintiff]”).  We therefore deny the DOC \nDefendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  as  to  the  claim  asserted  against  Wetzel  in  Count  I  of  the \nComplaint. \nIn  contrast  to  the  Complaints’  allegations  regarding  Wetzel,  the  only  allegations \nconcerning Noel state that he is “the Chief Medical Director of the DOC” and, as such, “has \nresponsibility in overseeing the delivery of medical services in the DOC.”  (Id. ¶ 10.)   The \nComplaint contains no other allegations suggesting that Noel was personally involved in the \ndenial of medical care to Plaintiffs or was involved in the development of the DOC’s policy with \nrespect to medical treatment for Hepatitis C.  We therefore conclude that the Complaint does not \nsufficiently allege that Noel had personal involvement in the alleged violation of Plaintiffs’ \nEighth  Amendment  rights  to  plausibly  state  a  §  1983  claim  against  him  for  deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  We thus \ngrant the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to the claim asserted against Noel in Count I of \nthe Complaint. \nThe DOC Defendants also argue that Count I should be dismissed as against Dreibelbis \nand Korszniak because they are not physicians, do not develop medical policies, and do not \npersonally deliver medical care.  Defendants further argue that Dreibelbis’s and Korszniak’s \nalleged denial of grievances with respect to medical issues does not raise an inference that they \nwere deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s medical needs.  Defendants rely on Fantone v. \n12 \n \n\nHerbik, 528 F. App’x 123 (3d Cir. 2013), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the \nThird  Circuit  concluded  that  a  prison  administrator’s  denial  of  an  inmate’s  grievance  with \nrespect to his medical care does not amount to deliberate indifference to his serious medical \nneeds where there is no evidence that the administrator “had a reason to believe that the prison \ndoctors were either mistreating or not treating [plaintiff], or that they inappropriately handled his \ngrievances.”  Id. at 128.   \nThe Complaint alleges that Dreibelbis, as a CHCA, “is responsible for the oversight of \nhealth care at SCI Smithfield,” that he personally failed “to have Mr. Chimenti seen or evaluated \nby a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for proper treatment of his liver condition,” and that he \npersonally informed Mr. Chimenti that the “‘PA DOC has not approved the use of [Harvoni] at \nthis time.  Thus it is not offered at this facility.’”  (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 63, 65 (alteration in original).)  \nThe Complaint thus specifically alleges that Dreibelbis personally failed to have Mr. Chimenti \ntreated by the appropriate medical specialist and that he informed Chimenti that he would not \nreceive the medical care he sought, i.e., treatment with a DAAD, even though Dreibelbis knew \nthat Chimenti was not being treated by an appropriate medical specialist.  Such allegations \nsupport a reasonable inference that Dreibelbis denied Chimenti’s requests for medical care even \nthough he “had a reason to believe that the prison doctors were . . . not treating [Chimenti].”  \nFantone, 528 F. App’x at 128.  We conclude, accordingly, that the Complaint sufficiently alleges \nthat Dreibelbis was personally involved in the denial of medical treatment to Chimenti and was \ndeliberately indifferent to Chimenti’s serious medical needs to plausibly state a § 1983 claim \nagainst him for violation of the Eighth Amendment.  We therefore deny the DOC Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss as to the claim asserted against Dreibelbis in Count I of the Complaint. \n13 \n \n\nThe Complaint alleges that Korszniak, as a CHCA, “is responsible for the oversight of \nhealth  care  at  SCI  Graterford”  and  that  he  personally  rejected  Mr.  Maldonado’s  grievance \nregarding the denial of his request to be treated with Harvoni, stating that the “‘drug [Harvoni] \nthat you mention has not yet been approved for use by the DOC, BHCS.  When the protols [sic] \nare extablished [sic] and the drug is approved there will be an assessment done to determine who \nwill qualify for the treatment.’”  (Id. ¶¶ 15, 85 (alterations in original).)  We conclude that these \nallegations support a reasonable inference that Korszniak denied Maldonado medical care even \nthough he “had a reason to believe that the prison doctors were . . . not treating [Maldonado].” \nFantone, 528 F. App’x at 128.  We conclude, accordingly, that the Complaint sufficiently alleges \nthat Korszniak was personally involved in the denial of medical treatment to Maldonado and was \ndeliberately indifferent to Maldonado’s serious medical needs to state a plausible § 1983 claim \nagainst  him  for  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.    We  consequently  deny  the  DOC \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to the claim asserted against Korszniak in Count I of the \nComplaint. \nIn summary, the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted in part and denied in \npart with respect to Count I of the Complaint.  The Motion is granted as to Noel and denied as to \nWetzel, Dreibelbis and Korszniak. \nC.  Count II \nCount II of the Complaint asserts a claim against twelve Defendants, including all six of \nthe DOC Defendants, for violation of Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which \nprovides that “[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel \npunishments inflicted.”  Pa. Const. Art. 1, § 13.  “This language parallels the Eighth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution.  Thus, the Pennsylvania prohibition is coextensive with the \n14 \n \n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.”  Tejada v. Corr. Officer \nDale,  Civ.  A.  No.  14-5604,  2015  WL  5729273,  at  *4  (E.D.  Pa.  Sept.  30,  2015)  (citing \nCommonwealth v. Cottam, 616 A.2d 988, 1003 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992)).  Consequently, the same \nlegal standard “‘applies to claims brought under Article 1, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania \nConstitution’” as applies to claims brought pursuant to the Eighth Amendment.  Id. (citing \nEliason v. Cty. of Lehigh, Civ. A. No. 08-5755, 2009 WL 2526199, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, \n2009)). \nThe DOC Defendants argue that Count II should be dismissed to the extent that Plaintiffs \nseek  monetary  damages  for  any  violation  of  the  Pennsylvania  Constitution.    Indeed,  “[n]o \nPennsylvania statute establishes, and no Pennsylvania court has recognized, a private cause of \naction for damages under the Pennsylvania Constitution.”  Pocono Mountain Charter Sch. v. \nPocono Mountain Sch. Dist., 442 F. App’x 681, 687 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Jones v. City of \nPhila., 890 A.2d 1188, 1208 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2006)).  However, Plaintiffs have unequivocally \nstated  that  they  “only  seek  injunctive  relief  under  the  Pennsylvania  Constitution.”    (Pls.’ \nConsolidated Response at 18.)  Accordingly, we deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \ninsofar as it seeks dismissal of the damages claim in Count II of the Complaint because Plaintiffs \ndo not seek damages in connection with Count II. \nD.  Count III \nCount III of the Complaint asserts a claim against twelve Defendants, including five of \nthe DOC Defendants (the DOC, Wetzel, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis), for medical malpractice \nunder Pennsylvania law.  Count III alleges that the DOC Defendants “had a duty to act in \naccordance with the standard of care required of medical professionals,” that “they breached that \nduty in failing to provide the standard of care necessary for individuals infected with Hepatitis C, \n15 \n \n\nand  [that]  Plaintiffs’  injuries  were  the  direct,  legal  and  proximate  result  of  Defendants[’] \nnegligence.”  (Compl. ¶ 103.)  The DOC Defendants seek the dismissal of Count III as against \nDefendant Wetzel on the ground that he has sovereign immunity as to this claim.  The DOC \nDefendants also ask us to dismiss this Count as to the four other named DOC Defendants on the \nground that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a claim for negligence under \nPennsylvania law. \n1.  Sovereign immunity \n“The  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity,  codified  at  1  Pa.C.S.  §  2310,  protects  the \nCommonwealth and its employees from . . . a suit for monetary damages unless the cause of \naction falls within one of several statutory exceptions . . . .”  Johnson v. Townsend, 314 F. App’x \n436, 439 (3d Cir. 2008); see also 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 2310 (“[I]t is hereby declared to be the \nintent of the General Assembly that the Commonwealth, and its officials and employees acting \nwithin  the  scope  of  their  duties,  shall  continue  to  enjoy  sovereign  immunity  and  official \nimmunity and remain immune from suit except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive \nthe immunity.”).  The General Assembly has waived sovereign immunity and consented to suit \nonly with respect to claims for damages arising from: (1) “[v]ehicle liability;” (2) “[m]edical-\nprofessional liability;” (3) “[c]are, custody or control of personal property;” (4) “Commonwealth \nreal  estate,  highways  and  sidewalks;”  (5)  “[p]otholes  and  other  dangerous  conditions;”  (6) \n“[c]are, custody or control of animals;” (7) “[l]iquor store sales;” (8) “National Guard activities;” \nand (9) “[t]oxoids and  vaccines.” 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8522(b).  These  exceptions to \nsovereign immunity are “strictly construed and narrowly interpreted.”  Brown v. Blaine, 833 \nA.2d 1166, 1173 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2003) (citing Bufford v. Pa. Dep’t of Transp., 670 A.2d 751 \n(Pa. Commw. Ct. 1996)).  The DOC Defendants maintain that, while the General Assembly has \n16 \n \n\nwaived sovereign immunity as to suits for “medical-professional liability,” that exception does \nnot apply to Wetzel because he is not a medical professional.   \nSection 8522 specifies that the “medical-professional liability” exception to sovereign \nimmunity  applies  to  “[a]cts  of  health  care  employees  of  Commonwealth  agency  medical \nfacilities or institutions or by a Commonwealth party who is a doctor, dentist, nurse or related \nhealth care personnel.”  42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8522(b)(2).  The Complaint does not allege \nthat Wetzel is a “health care employee[] of [a] Commonwealth agency medical facilit[y] or \ninstitution[].”  Id.  The Complaint also contains no allegations that Wetzel is “a doctor, dentist, \nnurse or related health care personnel.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that Wetzel should nonetheless be \ntreated as a healthcare employee of the BOP because he “directly established the impermissibly \nrestricted medical policy.”  (Pls.’ Consolidated Response at 17.)  However, Plaintiffs have cited \nno  authority  for  the  proposition  that  a  Commonwealth  official  who  is  not  a  “healthcare \nemployee[] of [a] Commonwealth agency medical facilit[y] or institution[]” and is not “a doctor, \ndentist, nurse or related health care personnel” should be treated as a healthcare employee simply \nbecause he participated in the establishment of a medical policy.  Indeed, “it is well-settled that \nimmunity  is  waived  only  for  claims  asserted  against  health  care  employees,  and  not  to \nindividuals who are not medical professionals.”   Green v. Fisher, Civ. A. No. 12-982, 2014 WL \n65763, at *11 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 8, 2014) (dismissing medical care negligence claim against the \nwarden, deputy warden, safety manager, maintenance manager, and food service manager of SCI \nSmithfield on sovereign immunity grounds because none of those defendants were health care \nemployees (citing McCool v. Dep’t of Corr., 984 A.2d 565, 570 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2009))); see \nalso Robus v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civ. A. No. 04-2175, 2006 WL 2060615, at *4 (E.D. Pa. July \n20, 2006) (dismissing state law negligence claim for inadequate medical care asserted against the \n17 \n \n\nsuperintendent of SCI Graterford on sovereign immunity grounds  since the superintendent of the \nprison was not a health care employee). \nWe conclude that the Pennsylvania state law medical malpractice claim asserted against \nWetzel in Count III is barred by sovereign immunity because Wetzel is an employee of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and no exceptions to sovereign immunity apply.  See 1 Pa. \nCons. Stat. Ann. § 2310; 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8522.  Consequently, we grant the DOC \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to the claim asserted against Wetzel in Count III of the \nComplaint. \n2.  Medical Malpractice \nThe Pennsylvania courts define medical malpractice “‘as the unwarranted departure from \ngenerally accepted standards of medical practice resulting in injury to a patient, including all \nliability-producing  conduct  arising  from  the  rendition  of  professional  medical  services.’”  \nPomroy v. Hosp. of Univ. of Pa., 105 A.3d 740, 744-45 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014) (quoting Toogood \nv. Owen J. Rogal, D.D.S., P.C., 824 A.2d 1140, 1145 (Pa. 2003)), appeal denied, 117 A.3d 298 \n(Pa. 2015).  “[T]o state a prima facie cause of action [for medical malpractice], a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate the elements of negligence:  a duty owed by the physician to the patient, a breach of \nthat duty by the physician, that the breach was the proximate cause of the harm suffered, and the \ndamages suffered were a direct result of [the] harm.”  Stimmler v. Chestnut Hill Hosp., 981 A.2d \n145, 154 (Pa. 2009) (quoting Quinby v. Plumsteadville Family Practice, 907 A.2d 1061, 1070-\n71) (Pa. 2006)).  The DOC Defendants argue that Count III should be dismissed as against the \nDOC, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis because the Complaint does not allege the manner in which \nthe actions or omissions of each of these Defendants were substantial causes of any injury to the \n18 \n \n\nPlaintiffs.  Specifically, they argue that the Complaint does not allege that Plaintiffs’ inability to \nobtain the new DAAD treatments for their Hepatitis C has caused a specific, identifiable injury.   \n  The Complaint alleges that Chimenti has “Stage 4 compensated cirrhosis with chronic \nliver failure” and “his Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (‘MELD’) score is 12.”2  (Compl. ¶ \n60.)    The  Complaint  further  alleges  that,  in  2009,  Dr.  Abhinav  Humar,  the  Chief  Liver \nTransplant Specialist from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, “recommended that Mr. \nChimenti be assessed with ultrasounds and CT scans of his liver every six months, and that if \n[his] ‘MELD’ score went above 10, that he be evaluated by a hepatologist for the possibility of a \nliver transplant.”  (Id. ¶ 61.)  However, since November 2013, the Defendants3 have denied \nChimenti the treatment he needs to track and stop the effects of his Hepatitis C, including the \nregular ultrasounds and CT scans recommended by Dr. Humar.  (Id. ¶ 62.)  Moreover, Dreibelbis \nhas failed to have Chimenti seen or evaluated by a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for \ntreatment of his liver condition.  (Id. ¶ 63.)  The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of \nDefendants’ failure to provide Chimenti with access to DAADs and other medical services for \ntreatment of his Hepatitis C, he “continues to suffer from chronic Hepatitis C infection and the \nrelated risks of liver failure and death, and physical and emotional pain and suffering.”  (Id. ¶ \n68.)  Furthermore, as a result of Chimenti’s advanced cirrhosis, he urgently needs medical \ntreatment, because once his liver decompensates, the only possible treatment will be a liver \n                                                 \n  2“The MELD score is a measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease \nand is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant.”  \n(Compl. ¶ 60.)  \n \n  3Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, we infer that the Complaint’s general \nallegations as to the actions of “Defendants” constitute an allegation that the referenced action or \nomission was taken by the DOC; by Noel who, as the Chief Medical Director of the DOC, is \nalleged to be responsible for overseeing the delivery of medical services in the DOC; and by \nOppman who, as the Director of BHCS, is responsible for supervising and monitoring medical \nservices in the DOC.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.) \n19 \n \n\ntransplant.  (Id. ¶ 69.)  Given these allegations, we conclude that the Complaint sufficiently \nalleges that the failure of the DOC, Noel, Oppman and Dreibelbis to provide Chimenti with the \nappropriate medical care for his Hepatitis C has injured him, as it alleges that because these \nDefendants denied Chimenti necessary medical care, he continues to suffer from Hepatitis C \ninfection, risks liver failure and death, and may have to undergo a liver transplant. \n  The Complaint alleges that Leyva has high levels of the Hepatitis C virus, for which he \nhas not been provided treatment with DAADs in spite of his specific requests for such treatment.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 75-78.)  The Complaint further alleges that Oppman personally denied Leyva’s request \nfor such treatment.  (Id. ¶ 78.)  The Complaint also alleges that Leyva “currently experiences \nsymptoms of Hepatitis C, including pain, fatigue,” and jaundice and that he “requires immediate \ntreatment to prevent any further liver damage.”  (Id. ¶ 79.)  We conclude that the Complaint \nsufficiently alleges that Oppman’s failure to provide Leyva with the appropriate medical care for \nhis Hepatitis C has injured him, in that it alleges that because Oppman denied Leyva necessary \nmedical care, he continues to suffer from symptoms of Hepatitis C, including pain, fatigue, and \njaundice. \n  The Complaint alleges that Maldonado had a liver biopsy in 2013, which showed that he \nhad liver fibrosis between stage 1 and stage 2.  (Id. ¶ 83.)  He has not received treatment for his \nHepatitis C since December 2013, even though he has requested treatment with DAADs.  (Id. ¶¶ \n83-86.)  The Complaint specifically alleges that Maldonado’s request for DAAD treatment was \ndenied because of a decision by the DOC and BHCS.  The Complaint further alleges that \nMaldonado needs immediate treatment to prevent any further liver damage or liver failure as a \nresult of his Hepatitis C.  (Id. ¶ 87.)  We conclude that the Complaint sufficiently alleges that the \nDOC and Oppman, the Director of the BHCS, have failed to provide Maldonado with the \n20 \n \n\nappropriate medical care for his Hepatitis C and that such failure has injured Maldonado, in that \nit alleges that because  the DOC and BHCS denied Maldonado necessary medical care, he \nrequires immediate treatment of his Hepatitis C to prevent further liver damage or liver failure.   \n  We conclude that the Complaint alleges sufficient facts regarding the harm that all three \nPlaintiffs have suffered as a result of the actions of the DOC, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis in \ndenying Plaintiffs DAAD treatment to state a facially plausible claim for medical malpractice \nunder Pennsylvania law.  We accordingly deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to \nthe medical malpractice claim asserted against the DOC, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis in Count \nIII of the Complaint. \nIn summary, the DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted in part and denied in \npart with respect to Count III of the Complaint.  The Motion is granted as to Wetzel and denied \nas to the DOC, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis. \nE.  Improper Venue \nThe DOC Defendants argue that the Complaint should be dismissed for improper venue \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1406.4  “A defendant \nseeking  to  dismiss  a  case  for  improper  venue  under  Rule  12(b)(3)  bears  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating that venue is improper.”  Cont’l Materials, Inc. v. Robotex, Inc., Civ. A. No. 14-\n6941, 2015 WL 1782053, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 17, 2015) (citing Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate, Inc. \nv. Abco Labs., Inc., Civ. A. No. 13–6004, 2014 WL 4795028, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 26, 2014)).  \n                                                 \n  4Although the DOC Defendants do not specifically rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1406, the Third \nCircuit  has made it clear that § 1406 governs the venue issue raised in their Motion to Dismiss.  \nSee Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 878 (3d Cir. 1995) (“In federal court, venue \nquestions are governed either by 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) or 28 U.S.C. § 1406.  Section 1404(a) \nprovides for the transfer of a case where both the original and the requested venue are proper. \nSection 1406, on the other hand, applies where the original venue is improper and provides for \neither transfer or dismissal of the case.”). \n \n21 \n \n\nWhen we decide a motion to dismiss for improper venue, we accept the allegations of the \nComplaint as true, “‘although the parties may submit affidavits in support of their positions,’ and \n[we] must ‘draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all factual conflicts in the plaintiff[’]s \nfavor.’”  Id. (second alteration in original) (quoting Giuliano v. CDSI I Holding Co., Civ. A. No. \n13–2776, 2014 WL 1032704, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 17, 2014)). \nPlaintiffs  maintain  that  venue  is  proper  in  this  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § \n1391(b)(2).5  We “undertake a two-part inquiry” of the DOC Defendants’ challenge to venue \nunder § 1391(b)(2).  Lannett Co. v. Asherman, Civ. A. No. 13-2006, 2014 WL 716699, at *3 \n(E.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2014).  “First, we ‘identify the nature of the claims and the acts or omissions \nthat the plaintiff alleges give rise to those claims.’”  Id. (quoting  Chester v. Beard, Civ. A. No. \n07–4742, 2008 WL 2310946, at *7 (E.D. Pa. June 2, 2008)).  “‘The test for determining venue is \nnot the defendant’s contacts with a particular district, but rather the location of those events or \nomissions  giving  rise  to  the  claim  .  .  .  .’”    Id.  (alteration  in  original)  (quoting  Cottman \nTransmissions Sys. v. Martino, 36 F.3d 291, 294 (3d Cir. 1994)).  “Second, we ‘determine \nwhether a substantial part of those acts or omissions . . . material to [those] claims . . . have \noccurred in the district in question.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Chester, 2008 WL \n2310946, at *7). \nSection 1391(b) provides that “[a] civil action may be brought in -- . . . (2) a judicial \ndistrict in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred . . . \n                                                 \n  5The Complaint alleges that venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(g), which clearly does not apply in this case. Plaintiffs argue, in their Response to the \nMotion to Dismiss, that venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).   \nWe assume, accordingly, that the reference to § 1391(g) in the Complaint was a typographical \nerror  and  that  Plaintiffs  intended  to  allege  venue  pursuant  to  §  1391(b)(2).    The  DOC \nDefendants, in their Memorandum, address the propriety of venue in this district solely with \nrespect to § 1391(b)(2). \n22 \n \n\n.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  The Complaint alleges that venue is appropriate in this district because \n“substantial events at issue in this litigation occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.”  \n(Compl. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the medical care given to the Plaintiffs and the \nDefendants’ failure to approve the Plaintiffs’ requests for treatment with DAAD medications.  \nPlaintiffs maintain that a substantial part of the events giving rise to their claims occurred in this \ndistrict because one Plaintiff, Maldonado, resides in this district and was denied medical care in \nthis district.  The Complaint alleges that Maldonado is incarcerated in this district and that \ndecisions regarding the medical care for his Hepatitis C infection, including the decision to deny \ntreatment with DAAD medications, were made by individuals employed by the DOC who are \nalso located in this district.  (Id. ¶¶ 7, 14, 15, 84-85.)  Defendants have submitted no evidence \nregarding the location of Maldonado’s medical care or where decisions were made regarding \nMaldonado’s medical care.  Drawing all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, we therefore \nconclude that a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims thus \noccurred in this district. \nThe DOC Defendants argue that venue is, however, improper in this district because the \nformulation of the DOC’s policy relating to the treatment of Hepatitis C occurred at the Central \nOffice of the BOP, which is located in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Defendants rely on \nour decision in Chester, in which we stated that, in cases “where plaintiffs challenge state-wide \npolicies, and not merely the actions of state officials in a single county, venue is proper pursuant \nto Section 1391(b)(2) in the district where those policies are developed.”  Chester, 2008 WL \n2310946, at *8 (citing Stanton-Negley Drug Co. v. Pa. Dep’t of Public Welfare, Civ. A. No. 07-\n1309, 2008 WL 1881894, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 24, 2008); Perkins v. Snyder, Civ. A. No. 94-\n4785, 1994 WL 530045, at *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 2, 1994); Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 \n23 \n \n\nU.S. 173, 185-86 (1979)).  We further concluded in Chester that, under the circumstances \npresented in that case, the district in which the policy was developed was the only proper venue.  \nId.  Chester, unlike the instant case, involved the constitutionality of the DOC’s lethal injection \nprotocol.  Id. at *1-3.  The Chester defendants argued that venue was improper in the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania because that protocol was developed solely in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania and they submitted evidence (the declaration of the then-Secretary of the DOC) \nthat all of “Pennsylvania’s [d]epartmental procedures and policies related to execution by lethal \ninjection are formulated and promulgated solely at DOC headquarters in Camp Hill, Cumberland \nCounty, Pennsylvania and [t]he only institution at which those procedures are utilized is SCI-\nRockview[,] located in Bellefonte, Centre County, Pennsylvania.”  Id. at *7 (internal quotation \nomitted).  Both Camp Hill and Bellefonte are located in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Id.  \nThe Chester plaintiffs did not assert that the DOC’s lethal injection policies or protocols were \ndeveloped or carried out in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  They asserted only that they \nwere incarcerated and had sought habeas relief in the Eastern District.  Id.  Because the record in \nthat case contained no allegations or evidence that the DOC’s lethal injection protocols were \ndeveloped or carried out in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, we determined that the Eastern \nDistrict was “not ‘a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claim occurred.’”  Id. at *8 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)). \nThe Complaint in this case, unlike the Complaint in Chester, alleges that decisions \npursuant to the policy in question were made and carried out in this district, and the Defendants \nhave submitted no evidence to the contrary.  Indeed, the DOC Defendants have supplied no \nevidence whatsoever in support of their position that their policy regarding the treatment of \nHepatitis C was formulated in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  We thus conclude that the \n24 \n \n\nDOC Defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that venue is improper in \nthis district.  Drawing all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, we further conclude that venue is \nappropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).  We therefore deny the DOC \nDefendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  to  the  extent  that  it  seeks  dismissal  of  the  Complaint  for \nimproper venue pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1406. \nF.  Request to Transfer \nThe DOC Defendants ask, in the alternative, that we transfer this action to the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404.  Section 1404 provides that “[f]or the \nconvenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any \ncivil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or \ndivision to which all parties have consented.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  “The district court has broad \ndiscretion in deciding a motion for transfer of venue.”  Synthes, Inc. v. Knapp, 978 F. Supp. 2d \n450, 458 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (citing Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29 (1988)).  \n“‘The burden of establishing the need for transfer [under § 1404(a)] . . . rests with the movant.’”  \nThompson v. Glob. Mktg. Research Servs., Inc., Civ. A. No. 15-3576, 2016 WL 233702, at *3 \n(E.D. Pa. Jan. 20, 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d \n873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995)).  “[T]he Third Circuit has explicitly stated that defendants have the \nburden of proof to support their motion to transfer with any affidavits, depositions, stipulations, \nor other documents containing facts that would tend to establish the necessary elements for a \ntransfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).”  Argro v. Marriott Int’l, Inc., Civ. A. No. 13-5507, 2014 \nWL 2572804, at *2 (E.D. Pa. June 6, 2014) (referring to Plum Tree, Inc. v. Stockment, 488 F.2d \n754,  756-57  (3d  Cir.  1973)  (quotation  omitted));  see  also  Plum  Tree,  488  F.2d  at  756-57 \n(determining that defendants failed to satisfy their burden of proof with respect to their motion to \n25 \n \n\ntransfer  because  they  failed  to  support  their  motion  “with  any  affidavits,  depositions, \nstipulations, or other documents containing facts that would tend to establish the necessary \nelements for a transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)”). \nOur first obligation under § 1404 is to determine whether this action could have been \nbrought in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the proposed transferee district.  See 28 U.S.C. § \n1404(a).  None of the parties argues that venue would not be appropriate in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania and we therefore accept as undisputed that this action could have been brought in \nthat district.  “Once it is determined that a case could have been brought in the proposed \ntransferee district, a court must weigh a variety of private and public factors to determine \nwhether the matter should be transferred under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).”  Swill Beverages, LLC v. \nU.S. Distilled Prods. Co., Civ. A. No. 15-5181, 2015 WL 9191470, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 17, \n2015). \nThe private [factors] include:  “plaintiff’s forum preference as manifested in the \noriginal choice; the defendant’s preference; whether the claim arose elsewhere; \nthe convenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and financial \ncondition; the convenience of the witnesses -- but only to the extent that the \nwitnesses may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and the location \nof books and records (similarly limited to the extent that the files could not be \nproduced in the alternative forum).”  \n \nThe public [factors] include:  “[T]he enforceability of the judgment; practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; the \nrelative administrative difficulty in the two fora resulting from court congestion; \nthe local interest in deciding local controversies at home; the public policies of the \nfora; and the familiarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law in diversity \ncases.”  \n \nThompson, 2016 WL 233702, at *3 (third alteration in original) (quoting Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879-\n80).   \n  We first address the private factors.  The record before us shows that Plaintiffs’ forum \npreference is the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the DOC Defendants’ preference is the \n26 \n \n\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania.  The Third Circuit has instructed that, when we rule on a \nmotion brought pursuant to § 1404, “‘the plaintiff’s choice of venue should not be lightly \ndisturbed.’”  Buckeye Pennsauken Terminal LLC v. Dominique Trading Corp., -- F. Supp. 3d --, \n2015 WL 9267386, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 21, 2015) (quoting Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879).  “While not \ndispositive, Plaintiff’s choice of forum is entitled to significant weight.”  AT&T Corp. v. PA, \nInc., 935 F. Supp. 584, 593 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (citing Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879).  Therefore, we \nconclude that the first two private factors, i.e., the parties’ preferences, when considered together \nweigh against transferring this action to the Middle District of Pennsylvania. \n  The DOC Defendants argue that the next two factors support transfer because Plaintiffs’ \nclaims arose in the Middle District of Pennsylvania and trial of this action would be more \nconvenient  for  the  parties  in  the  Middle  District.    Specifically,  Defendants  argue  that  the \nformulation of the DOC policy relating to the treatment of Hepatitis C took place in the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania and that several Defendants  and two Plaintiffs are located in that \ndistrict.  Defendants also contend, in their Brief, that the fifth and final private factor – the \nlocation of records – weighs in favor of transfer because records with respect to the formulation \nof the DOC’s policy are located in the Middle District.  Defendants make no argument with \nrespect to the fourth private factor, the location of witnesses.   \n  Defendants, however, have submitted no “affidavits, depositions, stipulations, or other \ndocuments containing facts that would tend to establish the necessary elements for a transfer \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).”  Argro, 2014 WL 2572804, at *2 (quotation omitted).  In the \nabsence of such evidence, we base our analysis of where Plaintiffs’ claims arose and the location \nof the parties, witnesses and records on the allegations of the Complaint.  As we discussed, \nsupra, the Complaint alleges that Maldonado is incarcerated in this District and that decisions \n27 \n \n\nwere made about his treatment for Hepatitis C by Defendants who are also located in this \nDistrict.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 14, 15, 84-85.) The Complaint also alleges that Maldonado has \nreceived treatment for his Hepatitis C in the Western District of Pennsylvania and that his appeal \nof his grievance with respect to his medical treatment was denied in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.  (Id. ¶¶ 83, 86.)  The Complaint alleges that Chimenti is incarcerated in the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, that individuals located in the Middle District of Pennsylvania have \nmade decisions about his medical care, and that he has been treated for his Hepatitis C in the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania.  (Id. ¶¶ 52, 59, 61, 63.)  The Complaint further alleges that \nLeyva is incarcerated in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, that he was first diagnosed with \nHepatitis C while he was incarcerated in the Western District of Pennsylvania, and that decisions \nregarding his medical care have been made in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  (Id. ¶¶ 71-72. \n77-78.)   \n  We find, based on these allegations, that Plaintiffs’ claims arose in both the Eastern and \nMiddle Districts of Pennsylvania.  We conclude that this private factor thus does not favor or \ndisfavor transferring this action to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  We further find, based \non the allegations of the Complaint, that there are witnesses who may know of facts relevant to \nPlaintiffs’ claims who are located in the Eastern, Middle and Western Districts of Pennsylvania.  \nThis private factor is thus neutral, not only because witnesses are located in all three districts in \nthis state, but also because the DOC Defendants do not assert that the witnesses who are located \noutside of this district would be unavailable for trial here.  We also infer from the allegations of \nthe Complaint that there are records of Plaintiffs’ medical treatment that are relevant to their \nclaims that are located in all three districts, and Defendants do not argue that any of the records \nrelevant to Plaintiffs’ claims, including those relating to the formation of the DOC’s policy, \n28 \n \n\ncannot be produced in this district.  We thus conclude that this private factor also does not weigh \nin favor of transferring this action to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  We conclude, based \nupon Defendants’ assertions, the allegations of the Complaint, and the inferences we may draw \nfrom those allegations, and in the absence of any evidence submitted by Defendants in support of \ntheir request for transfer, that the private factors as a whole do not support transfer of this action \nto the Middle District of Pennsylvania.   \nThe DOC Defendants make no argument regarding the public factors.  We nonetheless \nobserve any judgment of this Court should be equally enforceable in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania, that we have significant local interest in deciding the controversy since one of the \nPlaintiffs is located in this District, and that we are also aware of no practical considerations that \nwould make trial in this district less easy, expeditious, or inexpensive than trial in the Middle \nDistrict.  Moreover, because the DOC Defendants request an intra-state transfer, both the original \nand  transferee  courts  are  equally  familiar  with  the  applicable  state  law  and  there  are  no  \napplicable differences in public policy.  Accordingly, we conclude that the public factors also do \nnot weigh in favor of transferring this action to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  We further \nconclude that the DOC Defendants have not satisfied their burden of establishing the need to \ntransfer this action under § 1404(a).  See Thompson, 2016 WL 233702, at *3.  We thus deny the \nDOC Defendants’ request that we transfer this action to the Middle District of Pennsylvania \npursuant to § 1404(a).  \nIII.  THE MEDICAL DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS AND SEVER \n  Defendants Correct Care Solutions, Dr. Kephart, Dr. Weiner, Andrew Dancha, Dr. John \nHochberg, Dr. Nicholas Scharff, Wexford Health Sources, Inc., and Dr. Thomas Lehman, i.e., \nthe Medical Defendants, seek dismissal of all of the claims asserted against them pursuant to \n29 \n \n\nRule 12(b)(6) on the ground that the Complaint does not satisfy the pleading standard applicable \nto civil rights claims.  They also move to dismiss the claims against them on the ground that the \nComplaint does not allege facts that would establish that any of them had personal involvement \nin the violations of Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights. The Medical Defendants further move \nfor severance of the Plaintiffs’ claims on the ground that their claims cannot be joined in the \nsame action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20.  \nA.  The Motion to Dismiss6 \n1.  The appropriate pleading standard \n  The Medical Defendants argue that the Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety \nbecause it fails to plead Plaintiffs’ claims against them with the requisite factual specificity.  The \nMedical Defendants contend that civil rights complaints must be pled with “a higher degree of \nspecificity.”  Agresta v. City of Philadelphia, 694 F. Supp. 117, 119-20 (E.D. Pa. 1988) (citing \nHall v. Pennsylvania State Police, 570 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir. 1978)).  The Medical Defendants are, \nhowever, incorrect.  There are no special pleading standards for civil rights complaints.  See \nEvancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 351-52 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating that the heightened pleading \nstandard for civil rights complaints, which was required prior to 1993, no longer applies because, \nin 1993, the Supreme Court “held that a federal court may not” require a “‘heightened pleading \nstandard -- more stringent than the usual pleading requirement of Rule 8(a) . . . in civil rights \ncases . . . .’” (quoting Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, \n507 U.S. 163, 164 (1993))).  We therefore deny the Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to \n                                                 \n  6The Medical Defendants Motion to Dismiss purports to seek dismissal of the entire \nComplaint, but only includes arguments and legal authority concerning § 1983.  As Count I is the \nonly Count asserting a claim pursuant to § 1983, we construe the Motion as seeking only \ndismissal of Count I.   \n \n30 \n \n\ntheir argument that the Complaint should be dismissed because it fails to satisfy a heightened \npleading standard. \n2.  Vicarious liability as to the individual Medical Defendants \n  The Medical Defendants have also moved to dismiss Count I of the Complaint as against \nKephart, Weiner, Dancha, Hochberg, Scharff and Lehman, on the ground that the Complaint \nalleges only that they were vicariously liable for the violations of Plaintiffs’ rights and does not \nallege that they each had personal involvement in any such violations.  The Medical Defendants \nare correct that “[b]ecause vicarious liability is inapplicable to . . . § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must \nplead that each Government-official defendant, through the official’s own individual actions, has \nviolated  the  Constitution.”7    Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  676.    However,  Iqbal  did  not  “abolish[] \nsupervisory liability in its entirety.”  Barkes v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 319 (3d Cir. \n2014), overruled on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. Barkes, -- U.S. --, 135 S. Ct. 2042 (2015).  \nSupervisors “may be liable for unconstitutional acts undertaken by subordinates” in two ways.  \nId. at 316.  “First, liability may attach if they, ‘with deliberate indifference to the consequences, \nestablished and maintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused [the] constitutional \nharm.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting A.M. ex rel. J.M.K. v. Luzerne Cty. Juvenile Det. \nCtr., 374 F.3d 572, 586 (3d Cir. 2004)).  “Second, ‘a supervisor may be personally liable under § \n1983 if he or she participated in violating the plaintiff’s rights, directed others to violate them, or, \nas the person in charge, had knowledge of and acquiesced in the subordinate’s unconstitutional \nconduct.’”  Id. (quoting A.M., 372 F.3d at 586).  The Third Circuit has further explained that, in \nthe first situation, “a state official, by virtue of his or her own deliberate indifference to known \ndeficiencies in a government policy or procedure, has allowed to develop an environment in \n                                                 \n  7The Medical Defendants do not deny that Kephart, Weiner, Dancha, Hochberg, Scharff, \nand Lehman are all state actors for purposes of § 1983 liability. \n31 \n \n\nwhich there is an unreasonable risk that a constitutional injury will occur, and that such an injury \ndoes occur.”   Id. at 320.  “Liability in such a situation is, as Iqbal requires, imposed not \nvicariously  but  based  on  the  supervisor’s  own  misconduct,  because  to  exhibit  deliberate \nindifference to such a situation is a culpable mental state under the Eighth Amendment.” Id. \n(citing Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011)). \nAs we discussed supra, violation of the Eighth Amendment by deliberate indifference to a \nprisoner’s  serious  medical  needs  “can  be  shown  by  [defendant]  ‘intentionally  denying  or \ndelaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.’” \nRhines, 388 F. App’x at 227 (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05).  “A medical need is serious if \nit ‘has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay \nperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.’”  Id. (quoting Lanzaro, 834 \nF.2d at 347).  Moreover, the medical need must be such that “a failure to treat can be expected to \nlead to substantial and unnecessary suffering, injury, or death.”  Tsakonas, 308 F. App’x at 632.   \nThe Complaint alleges that Kephart “is the Medical Director at SCI Smithfield and is \nresponsible for providing health care to inmates there.”  (Compl. ¶ 12.)  The Complaint further \nalleges that, even though Dr. Humar recommended that Chimenti “be assessed with ultrasounds \nand CT scans of his liver every six months,” Kephart denied Chimenti “the necessary treatment \nto track and halt the deleterious effects of Hepatitis C, including regular ultrasounds and CT \nscans, which are medically necessary for individuals with Stage 4 cirrhosis.”  (Id. ¶¶ 61-62.)  The \nComplaint also alleges that, even though Chimenti has a MELD score of 12, and Dr. Humar \nrecommended that he be evaluated by a hepatologist regarding the need for a liver transplant if \nhis MELD score exceeded 10, Kephart has failed “to have Mr. Chimenti seen or evaluated by a \nhepatologist . . . for proper treatment of his liver condition.”  (Id. ¶¶ 60-61, 63.)  In light of these \n32 \n \n\nallegations, we conclude that the Complaint plausibly alleges that Kephart personally denied \nChimenti access to medical care for his serious medical needs.  Accordingly, we further conclude \nthat the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim that Kephart personally participated in \nviolating  Chimenti’s  Eighth  Amendment  rights  by  acting  with  deliberate  indifference  to \nChimenti’s serious medical needs.  We thus deny the Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nCount I of the Complaint as to Kephart. \nThe Complaint alleges that “Weiner is the Medical Director at SCI Graterford and is \nresponsible for providing health care to inmates there.”  (Id. ¶ 14.)  The Complaint further \nalleges that Maldonado, who has been diagnosed with liver fibrosis between Stage 1 and Stage 2, \nand who requires immediate treatment of that condition to prevent further liver damage or liver \nfailure, asked Weiner for DAAD treatment and his request was denied.  (Id. ¶¶ 83-84, 87.)  \nConstruing  these  allegations  in  the  light  most  favorable  Plaintiffs,  we  conclude  that  the \nComplaint  alleges  that  Weiner  personally  denied  Maldonado  access  to  necessary  medical \ntreatment for his serious medical needs.  Accordingly, we further conclude that the Complaint \nalleges  sufficient  facts  to  state  a  claim  that  Weiner  personally  participated  in  violating \nMaldonado’s Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to Maldonado’s \nserious medical needs.  We accordingly deny the Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count \nI of the Complaint as to Weiner. \nThe Complaint alleges that Dancha “is the Regional Medical Director for Correct Care \nSolutions, and is responsible for overseeing the delivery of medical services in DOC through \nCorrect Care Solution’s Central Region, including SCI Smithfield.”  (Id. ¶ 18.)  The Complaint \nalleges that Lehman “was the Medical Director of Wexford Health Source[,]” which was the \nmedical provider for the DOC prior to Correct Care Solutions.  (Id. ¶¶ 20-21.)  The Complaint \n33 \n \n\nfurther alleges that both Dancha and Lehman “failed with deliberate indifference to have Mr. \nChimenti seen or evaluated by a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for proper treatment of his \nliver condition.”  (Id. ¶ 63.)  However, the Complaint does not allege that either Dancha or \nLehman had any personal role in the delivery of medical care at SCI Smithfield, were personally \naware  of  Chimenti’s  medical  condition,  or  that  either  Dancha  or  Lehman    “‘intentionally \nden[ied] or delay[ed] [Chimenti’s] access to medical care or intentionally interfer[ed] with the \ntreatment once prescribed.’” Rhines, 338 F. App’x at 227 (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05).  \nWe conclude that the Complaint does not allege that either Dancha or Lehman “participated in \nviolating [Chimenti’s] rights, directed others to violate them, or, as the person in charge, had \nknowledge of and acquiesced’ in [a] subordinate’s unconstitutional conduct.’” Barkes, 766 F.3d \nat 319 (quoting A.M., 372 F.3d at 586); see also Lopez v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 499 F. App’x \n142, 146 (3d Cir. 2012) (stating that “we have found deliberate indifference to a prisoner’s \nserious medical needs only where a prison official knows of a prisoner’s need for medical \ntreatment but intentionally refuses to provide it, delays necessary medical treatment for a non-\nmedical reason, or prevents a prisoner from receiving needed medical treatment” (citing Rouse v. \nPlantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999))).  The Complaint also does not allege that either \nDancha or Lehman had any involvement in establishing or maintaining any policies, practices, or \ncustoms regarding the treatment of Hepatitis C in the DOC inmate population.  Consequently, we \nconclude that the Complaint does not allege that Dancha and Lehman were personally involved \nin “‘establish[ing] and maintain[ing] a policy, practice or custom which directly caused [the] \nconstitutional harm.’”  Barkes, 766 F.3d at 319 (third alteration in original) (quoting A.M., 372 \nF.3d at 586).  We further conclude, accordingly, that the Complaint does not allege sufficient \nfacts to plausibly state § 1983 claims against Dancha and Lehman for violating Chimenti’s \n34 \n \n\nEighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to Chimenti’s serious medical \nneeds.  We thus grant the Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Complaint as to \nDancha and Lehman. \nThe Complaint alleges that Hochberg “is the Assistant Medical Director for Correct Care \nSolutions’ Regional Office, and is responsible for overseeing the delivery of medical services in \nDOC through Correct Care Solution’s Central Region.”  (Compl. ¶ 19.)  The Complaint alleges \nthat Scharff “is the Medical Director for Correct Care Solutions in Pennsylvania, and in that \ncapacity is responsible for providing adequate medical care of Plaintiffs and those similarly \nsituated.”  (Id. ¶ 17.)  The Complaint does not allege that either Hochberg or Scharff were \npersonally aware of the medical conditions of any of the Plaintiffs or that either of them had any \npersonal involvement in the medical treatment of, or denial of treatment to, any of the Plaintiffs.  \nThe Complaint also does not allege that either Hochberg or Scharff had any involvement in \nestablishing  or  maintaining  any  policies,  practices,  or  customs  regarding  the  treatment  of \nHepatitis C in the DOC inmate population.  We conclude, accordingly, that the Complaint does \nnot allege sufficient facts to state a plausible § 1983 claim against either Hochberg or Scharff for \nviolating  the  Eighth  Amendment  rights  of  any  of  the  Plaintiffs  by  acting  with  deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of any of the Plaintiffs.   See Lopez, 499 F. App’x at \n146 (citing Rouse, 182 F.3d at 197); see also Barkes, 766 F.3d at 319 (quoting A.M., 372 F.3d at \n586).  We consequently  grant the Medical  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count  I of the \nComplaint as to Hochberg and Scharff. \n3.  Vicarious  Liability  as  to  Correct  Care  Solutions  and  Wexford  Health \nSources, Inc._________________________________________________ \n \n  The Medical Defendants have also moved to dismiss Count I of the Complaint as against \nthe corporate Medical Defendants, Correct Care Solutions and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., on \n35 \n \n\nthe ground that the Complaint alleges only that they were vicariously liable for the violation of \nPlaintiffs’ rights and does not allege that these corporations maintained policies that directly \ncaused  Plaintiffs’  injuries.    However,  contrary  to  the  Medical  Defendants  apparent \nunderstanding, Wexford Health Sources, Inc. is not named as a Defendant in Count I of the \nComplaint.8  As we cannot dismiss a claim that does not exist, we deny the Motion to Dismiss \nCount I of the Complaint as to Wexford Health Sources, Inc., and we analyze the Medical \nDefendants’ argument only as to Correct Care Solutions. \n  It is well settled that a municipal entity cannot be sued under § 1983 for the constitutional \ntorts of its employees. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  This rule \nhas been extended to private corporations operating under a contract with the state.  See Natale v. \nCamden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 583-84 (3d Cir. 2003).  Indeed, the Third Circuit has \nmade it clear that a private company that provides medical services to inmates at state facilities \n“‘cannot be held responsible for the acts of its employees under a theory of respondeat superior \nor vicarious liability.’”  Sims v. Wexford Health Sources, -- F. App’x --, 2015 WL 9267942, at \n*2 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Natale, 318 F.3d at 583).  Therefore, in order to state a § 1983 claim \nagainst Correct Care Solutions, the Complaint must allege “facts to state a claim that [Correct \nCare Solutions] had a policy, custom, or practice, and that the policy, custom, or practice caused \nthe  constitutional  violation  at  issue.”    Id.  (citing  Natale,  318  F.3d  at  583-84).    See  also \nStankowski v. Farley, 251 F. App’x 743, 748 (3d Cir. 2007) (stating that a private corporation \nproviding medical care inside a prison may not be held liable for the “constitutional violations \ncommitted by its employees, unless [it] has adopted a policy, practice or custom that caused the \nconstitutional violations alleged.” (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 690; Woodward v. Corr. Med. \n                                                 \n  8Wexford Health Sources, Inc. is named as a Defendant only as to Count IV of the \nComplaint, which alleges a claim against it for medical malpractice.   \n36 \n \n\nServs., 368 F.3d 917, 927 (7th Cir. 2004))); and see Ozoroski v. Maue, 460 F. App’x 94, 97-98 \n(3d Cir. 2012) (“To establish Eighth Amendment liability against a private employer . . . the \nprisoner must ‘provide evidence that there was a relevant [corporate] policy or custom . . . that . . \n. caused the constitutional violation [he] allege[s]’” (second through fifth alterations in original) \n(quoting  Natale 318 F.3d at 584)).  \n  The Complaint does not allege that Correct Care Solutions established a corporate policy \nor had a corporate practice or custom with respect to the provision of DAADs to inmates with \nHepatitis C.  The Complaint also does not allege that any such policy, custom, or practice of \nCorrect  Care  Solutions  caused  the  violations  of  Plaintiffs’  Eighth  Amendment  rights.    We \ntherefore conclude that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible § 1983 \nclaim against Correct Care Solutions for deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ serious medical \nneeds in violation of the Eighth Amendment and we grant the Medical Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Count I of the Complaint as against Correct Care Solutions on this basis. \n  In  summary,  we  deny  the  Medical  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  Count  I  of  the \nComplaint as to Kephart, Weiner, and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., and grant it as to Dancha, \nHochberg, Scharff, Lehman and Correct Care Solutions.  Count I is thus dismissed as against \nDancha, Hochberg, Scharff, Lehman and Correct Care Solutions.9  To the extent that the Medical \nDefendants may have intended to move to dismiss Counts II through IV of the Complaint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) because those counts allege only vicarious liability on the part of the \nMedical  Defendants,  we  deny  the  Motion  because  the  Medical  Defendants  have  cited  no \nauthority to support the proposition that they cannot be held vicariously liable for violations of \nArticle 1, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution or for medical malpractice. \n                                                 \n  9We need not dismiss Count I as to Wexford Health Sources because, as explained supra, \nWexford Health Sources is not named as a Defendant in that Count.  \n37 \n \n\nB.  Motion to Sever \n  The Medical Defendants also contend that we should sever Plaintiffs’ claims from one \nanother because they do not satisfy the requirements for permissive joinder pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 20.  Rule 20 provides that “[p]ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs \nif:  (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or \narising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) \nany question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n20(a)(1).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 provides that, if parties have been misjoined, we \n“may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 21.  The Medical \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims must be severed because none of the elements required \nby Rule 20(a)(1) are present in this case since the three Plaintiffs have very different medical \nconditions, have been treated by different medical personnel, and do not claim that they were \nharmed as a result of their own participation in a joint enterprise.   \n  “‘A district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to sever a party pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.’” Cooper v. Fitzgerald, 266 F.R.D. 86, 88 (E.D. Pa. 2010) \n(quoting Boyer v. Johnson Matthey, Inc., Civ. A. No. 02–8382, 2004 WL 835082, at *1 (E.D. \nPa. Apr. 16, 2004)).  “For courts applying Rule 20 and related rules, ‘the impulse is toward \nentertaining the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder \nof claims, parties and remedies is strongly encouraged.’”   Hagan v. Rogers, 570 F.3d 146, 153 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (quoting United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 724 (1966)).  “Rule 20 \npermits ‘the joinder of a person who has some interest in an action . . ., even when that interest is \nnot so strong as to require his joinder’ under Rule 19.”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Field \nv. Volkswagenwerk AG, 626 F.2d 293, 299 (3d Cir. 1980)).  \n38 \n \n\n  “The first element of Rule 20(a), the ‘same transaction’ or transactional relatedness \nprong, refers to the similarity in the factual background of the relevant claims.”  Cooper, 266 \nF.R.D. at 88 (citing Coughlin v. Rogers, 130 F.3d 1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1997)).  “‘Courts \ngenerally apply a case-by-case approach when considering whether the facts of several claims \nconstitute a single transaction or occurrence, or a series of transactions or occurrences.’”  Id. \n(quoting Lopez v. City of Irvington, Civ. A. No. 05-5323, 2008 WL 565776, at *2 (D.N.J. Feb. \n28, 2008)).  “Significantly, ‘[t]ransaction is a word of flexible meaning, which may comprehend \na  series  of  many  occurrences,  depending  not  so  much  upon  the  immediateness  of  their \nconnection, as upon their logical relationship.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Al Daraji v. \nMonica,  Civ.  A.  No.  07-1749,  2007  WL  2994608,  at  *8  (E.D.  Pa.  Oct.  21,  2007)).    “In \ndetermining whether a logical relationship exists between claims, the Third Circuit has stated \nthat courts must engage in ‘a detailed analysis . . . to determine whether the claims involve: (1) \nmany of the same factual issues; (2) the same factual and legal issues; or (3) offshoots of the \nsame basic controversy between the parties.’” Russell v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., 305 \nF.R.D. 78, 81 (M.D. Pa. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting Xerox Corp. v. SCM Corp., 576 \nF.2d 1057, 1059 (3d Cir. 1978)).   \n  The Plaintiffs’ claims in this case all involve the same alleged DOC policy and practice \nto “den[y] necessary medical  care for inmates diagnosed with  Hepatitis C viral infections, \nthereby placing them at substantial and unnecessary risk for severe illness, injury and death.”  \n(Compl. ¶ 1.)  The Complaint alleges that all three of the Plaintiffs, who are inmates in State \nCorrectional Institutions run by the DOC, have Hepatitis C and suffer from “serious health \ncomplications” arising from their Hepatitis C infections.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  The Complaint further alleges \nthat  Correct  Care  Solutions  is  the  current  health  care  provider  for  all  State  Correctional \n39 \n \n\nInstitutions run by the DOC and that Wexford Health Sources, Inc. was the previous health care \nprovider for those institutions.  (Id. ¶¶ 16, 20.)  The Complaint also alleges that, notwithstanding \nPlaintiffs’ serious medical conditions, “the DOC and other Defendants have refused to provide \nmedical treatment to Plaintiffs and others incarcerated in the DOC with Hepatitis C infections \nthat is consistent with current and prevailing medical standards.”  (Id. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiffs have \nbrought claims arising from the Defendants’ alleged denial of the appropriate medical treatment \nfor their serious medical conditions for violation of their rights under the Eighth Amendment and \nthe Pennsylvania Constitution and for medical malpractice.  We conclude that all three Plaintiffs’  \nclaims will involve many of the same factual and legal issues regarding the existence of the \nDOC’s policy to deny medical care, whether said policy actually resulted in the denial of medical \ncare to Plaintiffs and, if so, whether that denial of medical care amounted to medical malpractice \nand/or a violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Eighth Amendment.  Consequently, a logical \nrelationship exists between the claims raised by all three Plaintiffs such that the first prong of \nRule 20(a)(1) is satisfied.  This relationship also satisfies the second prong of Rule 20(a)(1).  See \nGarcia v. Brock-Weinstein, Civ. A. No. 13-7487, 2014 WL 2957487, at *2 (E.D. Pa. July 1, \n2014) (“‘The thing which makes the relationship logical is some nucleus of operative facts or \nlaw -- the second prong of the 20(a) test.’”  (quoting Hanley v. First Investors Corp., 151 F.R.D. \n76, 79 (E.D. Tex. 1993))).  We conclude, accordingly, that the Plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the \nrequirements for permissive joinder pursuant to Rule 20 and thus have not been misjoined in this \nlawsuit.  Consequently, we deny the Medical Defendants’ Motion to Sever their claims. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Motions to Dismiss are granted in part and denied in part \nas follows.  The DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count I of the Complaint is granted \n40 \n \n\nas to Noel and the § 1983 claim asserted in that Count is dismissed as to Noel.  The DOC \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count I of the Complaint is denied as to Wetzel, Dreibelbis, \nand Korszniak.  The DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count II of the Complaint is \ndenied.  The DOC Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count III of the Complaint is granted as \nto Wetzel and denied as to the DOC, Noel, Oppman, and Dreibelbis.  The DOC Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss is also denied as to their argument that venue is improper in this district and \nwe further deny their request that we transfer this case to the Middle District of Pennsylvania. \n  The Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Count I of the Complaint is granted as \nto Dancha, Hochberg, Scharff, Lehman and Correct Care Solutions and is denied as to Kephart, \nWeiner, and Wexford Health Source, Inc.  The Medical Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and \nSever is denied in all other respects.  \n  An appropriate order follows. \n \n              BY THE COURT: \n \n \n              /s/John R.

July 12, 2018 \n  Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, Daniel Leyva, and David Maldonado have brought this \nlawsuit on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals against John Wetzel, the Secretary of \nthe Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (the “DOC”), and Paul Noel, the Chief Medical \nDirector of the DOC (collectively the “DOC Defendants”), as well as two companies that have \ncontracted  to  provide  medical  services  for  the  DOC  and  officials  and  employees  of  those \ncompanies (collectively the “Medical Defendants”1), asserting claims regarding the medical care \nprovided to DOC inmates who have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C viral infections (“HCV”).  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs contend that the DOC Defendants have violated their rights under the \nEighth Amendment and the Pennsylvania Constitution by adopting a policy for the treatment of \ninmates with chronic HCV that fails to provide them with appropriate medical care.  Plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief requiring the DOC Defendants to formulate and implement a Hepatitis C treatment \npolicy that (1) meets community standards of care for patients with chronic HCV; (2) ensures that \ninmates with chronic HCV are treated with medically necessary and appropriate direct-acting \nantiviral drugs (“DAAs”); and (3) provides ongoing monitoring and medical care in accordance \nwith the standard of care for such patients’ liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.  In addition, Chimenti has \n                                                 \n  1 The Medical Defendants are Wexford Health Sources, Inc., Correct Care Solutions, LLC, \nDr. Jay Cowan, Dr. John Kephart, and Dr. James Frommer. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 2 of 28\nalso brought personal claims for medical malpractice against all Defendants for which he seeks \nmonetary damages.  Before the Court is the DOC Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nFor the reasons that follow, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part. \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  Plaintiffs Chimenti, Leyva, and Maldonado all suffer from chronic HCV and were, at the \ntime of the filing of this action, incarcerated in correctional institutions that are part of the DOC.  \n(See Compl. (Docket No. 1)   1-2; DOC Defs.’ Ans. to Compl. (Docket No. 30)   1-2.) \nBeginning in 2011, the United S¶t¶ates Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved D¶A¶As for \nthe treatment of Hepatitis C.  (Trooskin Rpt., Pls.’ Ex. A, at 2.)  These drugs, which include \nSovaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, are capable of achieving a “sustained virologic response,” which \nmeans “the elimination of the virus[,] for more than 90% of patients . . . .”  (Id. at 2-3.)  Prior to \nthe development of DAAs, the standard of care “was a three-drug treatment containing boceprevir \nor  telaprevir,  interferon  and  ribavirin”  that  “provided,  at  best,  a  70%  cure  rate,  and  was \naccompanied by significant adverse side effects such as anemia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, \nnausea, bone pain, muscle [pain], liver failure, joint pain, memory loss, and death.”  (Id. at 2.)  \nPlaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Stacey Trooskin, has opined that the use of DAAs is now “the standard of \nmedical care for the treatment of all HCV individuals . . . .”  (Id. at 3.) \n  When  Chimenti,  Leyva,  and  Maldonado  first  asked  to  be  treated  with  DAAs,  their \napplications were rejected by the DOC.  Chimenti began requesting treatment with DAAs in late \n2013, but Defendants denied his requests.  (Pls.’ Counterstatement of Add’l Facts (“PCSAF”)   \n225-30; DOC Defs.’ Resp. to PCSAF (“DRPCAF”)  225-30.)  Chimenti filed grievances aski¶n¶g \nfor treatment with DAAs in early 2014, but his grie¶va¶n ces were denied because the DOC did not \nhave a Hepatitis C protocol and had put all Hepatitis C treatment on hold.  (PCSAF   226-28; \n¶¶\n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 3 of 28\nDRPCAF   226-28.)  Chimenti has suffered from Stage 4 cirrhosis since at least 2000.  (Pls.’ Ex. \nU at 5.)  In¶ ¶October 2015, Chimenti was found to have a liver mass that was possibly cancerous.  \n(Chimenti Dep., Pls.’ Ex. R, at 37-39.)  He was pressured to have a biopsy of the mass, even though \na biopsy was not the standard of care and a radiologist refused to do the biopsy.  (Id.)  The lesion \nis not considered to be cancerous at this time.  (Id. at 40; Pls.’ Ex. Q at 1.)  Chimenti was treated \nwith DAAs beginning in October 2016.  (PCSAF   236; DRPCAF   236.)  Notwithstanding this \ntreatment, he currently suffers from diabetes that th¶at may be related¶ to his HCV, as well as severe \nfatigue and memory problems related to hepatic encephalopathy.  (Pls.’ Ex. Q at 1.) \nLeyva filed a grievance with the DOC on January 13, 2015, asking to be treated with the \nnew Hepatitis C drugs.  (Pls.’ Ex. V at 2.) The DOC upheld his grievance, but told him that it was \nevaluating its treatment options and developing a new treatment protocol and, in the meantime, \nwould only monitor patients with HCV.  (Id. at 3.)  On March 4, 2015, Leyva sent a letter to the \nDOC expressing his concern about having to wait for treatment while the DOC developed a new \ntreatment protocol for Hepatitis C.  (See id. at 4.)  The DOC responded that it was continuing to \nmonitor inmates with HCV while it evaluated treatment options.  (Id.)  On April 17, 2015, Leyva \nfiled a new grievance, asking to be treated with Harvoni.  (Id. at 5.)  That grievance was denied \nand the Secretary’s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals denied Leyva’s third level appeal of \nthat decision on September 8, 2015.  (Id. at 7-19.)  Leyva still has not received treatment with \nDAAs.  (lst Am. Class Action Compl. (“1st Am. Compl.”) (Docket No. 50)   68; DOC Defs.’ Ans. \nto lst Am. Compl. (Docket No. 93)   13.)    ¶\n  Maldonado also filed a griev¶ance asking to be treated with the latest DAAs.  (DOC Defs.’ \nEx. B; Pls.’ Ex. F.)  The DOC rejected his grievance and has not treated Maldonado with DAAs.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 4 of 28\n(DOC Defs.’ Ans. to 1st Am. Compl.   16.)  Maldonado was paroled on May 15, 2017 and is not \ncurrently incarcerated by the DOC.  (D¶OC Defs.’ Ex. H at 2.) \nThe DOC issued an Interim Hepatitis C Protocol in November 2015 and began treating \nsome inmates with DAAs.  (DOC Defs.’ Statement of Material Facts (“SMF”)   53; Pls.’ Resp. to \nSMF (“PRSMF”)   53.)  The DOC issued a new protocol for the treatment of H¶CV on November \n7, 2016, the “Hep¶atitis C Protocol.”  (SMF  40; PRSMF   40.)  Pursuant to the Hepatitis C \nProtocol, the DOC screens all inmates for HC V¶ with an antibo¶dy test and confirms HCV diagnosis \nwith additional testing.  (DOC Defs.’ Ex. J §§ B.1, B.2.)  The DOC also advises inmates who have \nHCV regarding the Hepatitis C Protocol, and keeps track of inmates who have HCV.  (Id. §§ B.4., \nand C.)  The DOC enters all inmates with chronic HCV into its Liver Disease Chronic Care Clinic.  \n(Id. § G.1.)   \n  Pursuant  to  the  Hepatitis  C  Protocol, the  DOC  uses  an  infected  inmates’  Aspartate \nAminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (“APRI”) score to estimate hepatic fibrosis, predict the \npresence of cirrhosis, and prioritize treatment for HCV.  (Id. §§ D.1.b, H.4.)  Fibrosis is designated \nby Metavir score, which ranges from F0 to F4:  F0 shows no fibrosis, F1 shows periportal \ninflammation with minimal fibrosis, F2 shows periportal fibrosis with mild bridging, F3 shows \nperiportal fibrosis with moderate bridging, and F4 represents a cirrhotic liver.  (Cowan Dep., DOC \nDefs.’ Ex. L, at 49.)  APRI scores are indirect markers of fibrosis.2  (Id. at 43.)  “An APRI score \ngreater than 2.0 suggests a fibrosis score of F3 or F4. . . .  An APRI score between 1.0 and 2.0 \nsuggests a fibrosis score of F2. . . .  An APRI score less than 1.0 suggests a fibrosis score of F0 or \nF1.”  (Noel Decl., DOC Defs.’ Ex. N,   19-22.)  As Dr. Noel has explained, “APRI scores are \n¶¶\n                                                 \n  2 Both liver biopsy and shearwave elastograpy are more accurate tests for determining a \npatient’s fibrosis level.  (See Cowan Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex. L, at 43-44; Noel Dep., DOC Defs.’ \nEx. K, at 110; Kendig Dep., Pls.’ Ex. K, at 55-56.) \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 5 of 28\nmore accurate at the end ranges, i.e. greater than 2.0 and less than 1.0 (F3, F4 and F0, F1.)”  (Id.  \n 23.)  APRI scores at the 1.5 to 2 level only have “a sensitivity accuracy of about 48 percent” and \n¶an APRI score of 1 would miss approximately 23% of patients with cirrhosis.  (Cowan Dep., DOC \nDefs.’ Ex. L, at 42.)   \n  The Hepatitis C Protocol requires follow-up appointments at the Chronic Care Clinic for \ninmates who are diagnosed with Metavir scores of F0 to F2 every six months, for those with \nMetavir scores of F3 every three months, and for those with Metavir scores of F4 every month.  \n(DOC Defs.’ Ex. J § G.3.d.)  While all patients diagnosed with chronic HCV are followed at the \nChronic Care Clinic, they are not all treated with DAAs to cure their HCV.  Instead, the Hepatitis \nC Protocol requires the DOC to treat the sickest inmates first, and it bases treatment decisions on \nan inmate’s Metavir scores, as estimated by APRI scores.  (SMF   45, 53; PRSMF   45, 53; \nDOC Defs.’ Ex. J § H.4.)  According to the Hepatitis C Protocol, inm¶a¶tes with cirrhosis a¶r¶e Priority \nLevel 1 – the highest priority for treatment with DAAs.  (DOC Defs.’ Ex. J § H.4.a.)  Inmates with \nAPRI scores greater than 2, or who have shown to have Metavir scores of F3 on a liver biopsy, as \nwell as inmates who are coinfected with Hepatitis B or HIV, are Priority Level 2.  (Id. § H.4.b.)  \nInmates shown to have Metavir scores of F2 on liver biopsy, APRI scores of at least 1.5 and less \nthan 2.0, or who have diabetes, are Priority Level 3.  (Id. § H.4.c.)  Inmates with Metavir scores of \nF0 to F1 on liver biopsy are Priority Level 4, as are all other inmates with HCV infections who \nmeet the DOC’s criteria for treatment.  (Id. § H.4.d.) \n  Fewer than 10% of DOC inmates with chronic HCV have been treated with DAAs under \nthe Hepatitis C Protocol.  (PCSAF   178; DRPCAF   178.)  As of September 20, 2017, the DOC \nheld 7,521 inmates who have been ¶infected with Hep¶atitis C, 5,265 of whom have chronic HCV.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 6 of 28\n(Wenhold Decl., DOC Defs.’ Ex. F,   15-16.)  The DOC has treated 297 of its inmates who have \nchronic HCV with DAAs.  (Id.   17.¶) ¶\n  The First Amended Com¶plaint states four claims for relief on behalf of the following class: \nall  persons  who  are  currently  incarcerated  in  a  Pennsylvania  Department  of \nCorrections facility with a diagnosed condition of Chronic Hepatitis C, and who \nhave at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their sentences, and \nwho have a life expectancy of over one year.  \n \n(5/24/18 Order, Docket No. 108.)  Count I asserts a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the \nDOC Defendants and two of the Medical Defendants3 on behalf of the three named Plaintiffs and \nthe Class for deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners infected with HCV \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  (1st Am. Compl.   90.)  \nCount II asserts a claim for injunctive relief against Wetzel on behalf of the three named Pla¶intiffs \nand the Class for violation of Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.  (Id.   92.)  Count \nIII asserts a claim against Dr. Noel and the Medical Defendants for medical malpract¶ice on behalf \nof Chimenti.  (Id.   94.)  Count IV asserts a claim against Correct Care Solutions, LLC and \nWexford Health Sou¶rces, Inc. (two of the Medical Defendants) for medical malpractice on behalf \nof Chimenti.  (Id.   96.)  Plaintiffs seek an injunction on behalf of themselves and the Class \nordering the DOC to¶: \n(a)  formulate  and  implement  a  Hepatitis  C  treatment  policy  that  meets  the \ncommunity standards of care for patients with Hepatitis C, (b) that members of the \nClass be treated with medically necessary and the appropriate direct-acting antiviral \ndrugs based on individual medical testing and medical evaluation regarding each \nindividual’s Hepatitis C status, and (c) that members of the [C]lass receive ongoing \nmonitoring and medical care per the standard of care for their individual level of \nliver fibrosis and cirrhosis, including but not limited to appropriate access to and \n                                                 \n  3 Count I asserts a claim for both injunctive relief and monetary damages.  Plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief in Count I on behalf of themselves and the Class against the DOC Defendants \nonly.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages in Count I only on behalf of Chimenti and they seek to \nobtain damages from Dr. Kephart and Dr. Frommer as well as the DOC Defendants.    \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 7 of 28\nevaluation by a hepatologist and assessment regarding their need for partial or full \nliver transplant. \n \n(Id.   98.)  Plaintiffs also seek compensatory and punitive damages for Chimenti, reasonable \nattor¶ney’s fees and costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  (Id.   99-\n102.)  ¶¶\nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  An issue is “genuine” if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A factual \ndispute is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Id. \n“[A] party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing \nthe district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it \nbelieves demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on a particular \nissue at trial, the movant’s initial Celotex burden can be met simply by “pointing out to the district \ncourt” that “there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.”  Id. at 325.  \nAfter the moving party has met its initial burden, the adverse party’s response “must support the \nassertion [that a fact is genuinely disputed] by:  (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the \nrecord . . . ; or (B) showing that the materials [that the moving party has] cited do not establish the \nabsence . . . of a genuine dispute.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).  Summary judgment is appropriate if \nthe nonmoving party fails to respond with a factual showing “sufficient to establish the existence \nof an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof \nat trial.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  In ruling on a summary judgment motion, we consider “the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 8 of 28\nfacts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to . . . the party who oppose[s] \nsummary judgment.”  Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 179 n.1 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Scott \nv. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007)). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Count I \n  The DOC Defendants move to dismiss Count I on the grounds of mootness, failure to \nexhaust administrative remedies, lack of standing, and because the record does not support \nPlaintiffs’ claims that they were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.  We address these arguments in turn. \n1.  Mootness \n  The DOC Defendants argue that we should dismiss Maldonado’s request for injunctive \nrelief as to Count I because it is moot.  As we mentioned above, Maldonado was paroled on May \n15, 2017 and is not currently incarcerated by the DOC.  (DOC Defs.’ Ex. H at 2.)  “Generally, \ncourts have held that an inmate’s release from a correctional institution makes his or her claims \nfor injunctive relief moot.”   Sutton v. City of Phila., 21 F. Supp. 3d 474, 480-81 (E.D. Pa. 2014) \n(citations omitted).  “The mootness doctrine requires that an actual controversy exist at all stages \nof review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.”  Doe v. Delie, 257 F.3d 309, 313 (3d Cir. \n2001) (citing New Jersey Turnpike Auth. v. Jersey Cent. Power & Light, 772 F.2d 25, 31 (3d Cir. \n1985)).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has explained that “‘mootness \nhas two aspects: (1) the issues presented are no longer “live” or (2) the parties lack a cognizable \ninterest in the outcome.’”  Id. (quoting New Jersey Turnpike Auth., 772 F.2d at 31).  Since \nMaldonado has been released, he is no longer in the custody of the DOC and any injunctive relief \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 9 of 28\nregarding medical treatment provided by the DOC “would have no impact on him, and therefore \nhis equitable claims are moot.”  Id.   \n  Plaintiffs contend that Maldonado’s claims fall under the “inherently transitory” exception \nto the mootness doctrine.  However, the cases upon which they rely concern whether a putative \nclass representative plaintiff can continue to seek class certification after his individual claim has \nbecome moot.  See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975); United States Parole Comm’n \nv. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980); Richardson v. Bledsoe, 829 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir. 2016).  \nPlaintiffs have pointed to no authority for the proposition that an individual can continue to seek \nrelief as to his own personal claim once that claim has become moot. \n  The DOC Defendants concede that Maldonado has “standing to bring and maintain this \naction on behalf of the class members regardless of [his] own individual claims being moot.”  \n(DOC Defs.’ Reply at 18.)  They argue only that his individual claim should be dismissed as moot \nbecause he is no longer incarcerated by the DOC.  We agree.  Accordingly, we grant the DOC \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to their argument that Maldonado’s individual \nclaim for injunctive relief in Count I of the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed as moot. \n  The DOC Defendants also argue that we should dismiss Chimenti’s claim for injunctive \nrelief in Count I as moot because he has already received the requested relief.  See Hollihan v. Pa. \nDep’t of Corr., 159 F. Supp. 3d 502, 509 (M.D. Pa. 2016) (dismissing claim for injunctive relief \nseeking an order requiring the DOC to provide plaintiff with cataract surgery after plaintiff \nreceived the cataract surgery).  As we discussed above, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that will \nrequire Defendants to implement a Hepatitis C treatment policy that meets community standards \nof care; treat members of the Class with medically necessary and appropriate DAAs and provide \nongoing monitoring and medical care to class members that is appropriate for their individual level \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 10 of 28\nof liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, including evaluation by a hepatologist and assessment regarding \ntheir need for partial or full liver transplant.  (1st Am. Compl.   98.)  Chimenti has already received \ntreatment with DAAs and, accordingly, no longer personally¶ needs the second of the three items \nin the requested injunction.  (PCSAF   236; DRPCAF   236.)  However, there is no basis on the \nrecord before us upon which we coul¶d determine that ¶Chimenti has no interest in requiring the \nDOC Defendants to formulate and implement a policy for the treatment of Hepatitis C that meets \ncommunity standards of care or that he no longer needs monitoring and medical care for cirrhosis \nor liver fibrosis and access to treatment by a hepatologist.  Indeed, Chimenti’s medical expert, Dr. \nBennet Cecil, has opined that Chimenti still has a liver lesion and suffers from diabetes, severe \nfatigue, and memory problems relating to hepatic encephalopathy.  (Pls.’ Ex. Q at 1.)  We conclude \nthat Chimenti’s claim for injunctive relief is not moot and we deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment as to this issue. \n2.  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n  The DOC Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Leyva’s claim \nfor injunctive relief in Count I because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to \nfiling this lawsuit.    The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides that “[n]o action shall \nbe brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal \nlaw,  by  a  prisoner  confined  in  any  jail,  prison,  or  other  correctional  facility  until  such \nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  Specifically, the \nDOC Defendants argue that Leyva did not exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit \nbecause the DOC’s Secretary’s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals did not issue a decision \nat the third and final level with respect to Leyva’s second grievance until September 8, 2015, nearly \nthree months after this action was initiated on June 12, 2015.  “If exhaustion is incomplete when \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 11 of 28\nan inmate files suit, dismissal is mandatory.”   Turner v. Sec’y Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 683 F. App’x \n180, 182 n.1 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002); and Nyhuis v. Reno, \n204 F.3d 65, 77 n.12 (3d Cir. 2000)).  Moreover, “[a]n inmate cannot cure non-compliance with \n[the PLRA] by exhausting remedies after filing his complaint.”  Id. (citation omitted). \n  However,  we  concluded  in  our  May  24,  2018  Memorandum  and  Opinion  granting \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification that the doctrine of vicarious exhaustion applies in this \ncase.  See Chimenti v. Wetzel, Civ. A. No. 15-3333, 2018 WL 2388665, at *5 (E.D. Pa. May 24, \n2018).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has explained that, pursuant \nto this doctrine, “a class of prisoner-plaintiffs certified under Rule 23(b)(2) satisfies the PLRA’s \nadministrative exhaustion requirement through ‘vicarious exhaustion,’ i.e., when ‘one or more \nclass members ha[s] exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to each claim raised by \nthe class.’”  Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 2004) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Jones ‘El v. Berge, 172 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1133 (W.D. Wis. 2001); and citing Hattie v. \nHallock, 8 F. Supp. 2d 685, 689 (N.D. Ohio 1998)).  Vicarious exhaustion “advances the purpose \nof administrative exhaustion, which . . . ‘is to put the [administrative authority] on notice of all \nissues in contention and to allow the [authority] an opportunity to investigate those issues.’” Id. \n(alterations in original) (quoting Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1531 (11th Cir. 1985)).  Since \nDefendants do not dispute that both Chimenti and Maldonado exhausted their administrative \nremedies prior to filing suit pursuant to the PLRA, we conclude Leyva’s PLRA exhaustion \nrequirement is satisfied through vicarious exhaustion.  We thus deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment as to their argument that Leyva’s claim for injunctive relief in Count I \nshould be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 12 of 28\n  Defendants also argue that we should dismiss the claims brought in Count I as to all but \nseven of the members of the Class, because only seven members of the Class properly exhausted \ntheir administrative remedies pursuant to the PLRA before this action was filed.  As we discussed \nabove, we have concluded that vicarious exhaustion applies in this case.  Since there is no dispute \nthat both Chimenti and Maldonado exhausted their administrative remedies pursuant to the PLRA \nprior to filing suit, we conclude that the PLRA exhaustion requirement is satisfied through \nvicarious exhaustion as to all of the members of the class who did not personally exhaust their \nadministrative remedies with respect to the claims asserted in Count I of the First Amended \nComplaint.  We thus deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to their \nargument that the claims asserted in Count I should be dismissed as to all but seven members of \nthe Class for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. \n3.  Standing \n  Defendants argue that future inmates of the DOC lack standing to assert claims in this case \nand should be dismissed as plaintiffs in this action.  Specifically, Defendants contend that the \ndefinition of the class includes individuals who are not yet inmates in the custody of the DOC and \nthat the named Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims on behalf of those individuals.  However, \nthe definition of the class includes only “all persons who are currently incarcerated in a \nPennsylvania Department of Corrections facility with a diagnosed condition of chronic Hepatitis \nC.”  (5/24/18 Order, Docket No. 108 (emphasis added).)  Since the class does not include any \nindividuals who are not “currently incarcerated” in a DOC facility, we deny the DOC Defendants’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment as to this argument. \n   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 13 of 28\n4.  Deliberate indifference \n  The DOC Defendants also argue that they are entitled to the entry of summary judgment \nin their favor as to Count I because the factual record does not support Plaintiffs’ claim that the \nDOC Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs.  Count I asserts \na  claim  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  for  violation  of  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment based on the denial of medical care for their chronic HCV.  Section 1983 provides, \nin pertinent part, as follows: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction \nthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in \nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “Section 1983 provides remedies for deprivations of rights established in the \nConstitution or federal laws. It does not, by its own terms, create substantive rights.”  Kaucher v. \nCty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted) (citing Baker v. McCollan, 443 \nU.S. 137, 145 n.3 (1979)).  Consequently, in order to obtain relief pursuant to § 1983, “a plaintiff \nmust demonstrate [that] the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived him or her of a \nright secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.” Id. (citing Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. \nCo. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49-50 (1999), and Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1141 \n(3d Cir. 1995)). \n  Count I alleges that the Defendants’ “acts and omissions in failing to provide adequate \nmedical care constitute a deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners infected \nwith Hepatitis C, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.”  (1st. Am. Compl. ¶ 90.)  The Eighth Amendment’s right to be free from cruel and \nunusual punishment, which applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, Robinson v. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 14 of 28\nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660, 675 (1962), “imposes duties on [prison] officials, who must . . . ensure \nthat inmates receive . . . medical care, and must ‘take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety \nof the inmates.’”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 \nU.S. 517, 526-27 (1984) (additional citations omitted)).  To succeed on a claim under the Eighth \nAmendment for denial of medical care, a plaintiff must establish that a defendant showed “[1] \ndeliberate indifference to [2] serious medical needs of [a] prisoner[ ].”  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 104 (1976).  Courts have consistently held that “mere allegations of malpractice” are not \nsufficient to allege “deliberate indifference.”  Id. at 106 n.14. \n  “Deliberate indifference can be shown by a prison official ‘intentionally denying or \ndelaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.’” \nRhines v. Bledsoe, 388 F. App’x 225, 227 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05). \n“A medical need is serious if it ‘has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one \nthat is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.’”  \nId. (quoting Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)).  \nMoreover, the medical need must be such that “‘a failure to treat can be expected to lead to \nsubstantial and unnecessary suffering, injury, or death.’”  Tsakonas v. Cicchi, 308 F. App’x 628, \n632 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 1023 (3d Cir. 1991)).   \n  A prison official acts with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need “when he \nknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.”  Brown v. Thomas, 172 F. \nApp’x 446, 450 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  “The official must be aware of \nthe facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and \nhe must also draw the inference.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has instructed that \nwe should distinguish “‘deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners,’” from \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 15 of 28\n“‘negligen[ce] in diagnosing or treating a medical condition,’” because “only the former violates \nthe [Cruel and Unusual Punishments] Clause.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835 (first alteration in original) \n(quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106).   Therefore “Eighth Amendment liability requires ‘more than \nordinary lack of due care for the prisoner’s interests or safety,’” id. (quoting Whitley v. Albers, \n475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986)), and “[a]llegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish \na Constitutional violation.”  Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004).  The Third Circuit \nhas “‘found “deliberate indifference” in a variety of circumstances, including where the prison \nofficial (1) knows of a prisoner’s need for medical treatment but intentionally refuses to provide \nit; (2) delays necessary medical treatment based on a non-medical reason; or (3) prevents a prisoner \nfrom receiving needed or recommended medical treatment.’”  Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, \n337 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999)).  The DOC \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish that they have been deliberately indifferent to \ninmates’ serious medical needs because the DOC has a Hepatitis C Policy and it has treated, or is \nin the process of treating, all inmates with chronic HCV who have serious medical needs. \na.  The Hepatitis C Protocol \n  The DOC Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Count I of \nthe First Amended Complaint because the DOC has adopted a Hepatitis C Protocol that provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nfor treatment with DAAs for some inmates with chronic HCV and thus, they are not deliberately \nindifferent to inmates’ serious medical needs.  As we described above, after first denying treatment \nwith DAAs to all inmates with chronic HCV, the DOC adopted the Interim Hepatitis C Protocol \nin November 2015, pursuant to which some, but not all, inmates with cirrhosis were prioritized for \ntreatment with DAAs.  (SMF   53; PRSMF   53; Pls.’ Ex. P § F.)  A year later, on November 7, \n2016, the DOC adopted the He¶patitis C Proto¶col, which prioritizes DAA treatment of inmates with \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 16 of 28\nchronic HCV.  (SMF   40; PRSMF   40; DOC Defs.’ Ex. J § H..)  Pursuant to these Protocols, \nthe DOC has treated in¶mates with Me¶tavir scores of F3 and F4.  (Noel Decl., DOC Defs.’ Ex. N., \n 14.)  The DOC intends to continue treating inmates with Metavir scores of F3 and F4 and expects \n¶to treat inmates with Metavir scores of F2 in 2018.  (Id.   14-15.)   \n  Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants are not entitle¶d¶ to summary judgment as to Count I of \nthe First Amended Complaint just because the DOC has adopted the Hepatitis C Protocol.  \nPlaintiffs contend both that the DOC Defendants can always change the Protocol once this case is \nover, and that the adoption of the Protocol itself was deliberately indifferent to the serious medical \nneeds of inmates with chronic HCV.  Plaintiffs rely on Knox v. Service Employees Int’l Union, \nLocal 1000, 567 U.S. 298 (2012), in which the Supreme Court explained that “[t]he voluntary \ncessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for \nmootness would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is dismissed.”  \nId. at 307 (citing City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)); see also \nAlready, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (“[A] defendant cannot automatically moot a \ncase simply by ending its unlawful conduct once sued. Otherwise, a defendant could engage in \nunlawful conduct, stop when sued to have the case declared moot, then pick up where he left off, \nrepeating this cycle until he achieves all his unlawful ends.” (citing City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at \n289)).  Consequently, “‘a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the \nformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not \nreasonably be expected to recur.’”  Sourovelis v. City of Phila., 103 F. Supp. 3d 694, 701 (E.D. \nPa. 2015) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n190, (2000)).   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 17 of 28\n  Plaintiffs argue that the Hepatitis C Protocol is an administrative protocol that has no force \nof law and can be changed, amended, or terminated at any time and, thus, there is nothing to \nprevent the DOC from stopping treatment of inmates with DAAs in the future.  The DOC \nDefendants have put forth no evidence that shows that “the allegedly wrongful behavior could not \nreasonably be expected to recur.”  Sourovelis, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 701 (quotation omitted). \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the record shows that the DOC Defendants adopted the current \nprotocol because it limits the number of inmates who will be treated with DAAs for reasons other \nthan medical need.  There is record evidence that the DOC chose not to treat any inmates with \nDAAs in 2014 because of the cost.  (Noel Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex. K, at 80-81.)  There is also \nevidence that the DOC’s restriction of treatment with DAAs to inmates with Metavir scores of F3 \nand  F4  under  the  Hepatitis  C  Protocol  was  based  on  the  cost  of  treatment,  not  medical \nrecommendations or the treatment protocols used by other prisons.  Indeed, Dr. Noel rejected \nadvice that he received from Dr. Scharff, then the DOC Chief of Clinical Services, Bureau of \nHealth Care Services, and Eugene Ginchereau, Assistant State Medical Director, that patients with \nan APRI score of 1.0 or greater should be treated with DAAs, informing Dr. Scharff and Mr. \nGincherau that:  “[o]ut of 6,000 DOC inmates who were Hep C, 700 had an APRI score of greater \nthan 1.0.  For purposes of establishing the magnitude of treating them all, it would be 700 x \n$100,000 or $70 million . . . .  Somehow, I’m going to have to further prioritize this number.”  (Id. \nat 81-82; Pls.’ Ex. L.)  Dr. Noel confirmed during his deposition that the only prioritization factor \nthat he was considering at that time was cost.  (Noel Dep. at 82.)  So, in Dr. Noel’s opinion, even \nthough an APRI score of 1.0 might qualify an inmate for DAA treatment in other prison systems, \nthe DOC would have to “find a higher APRI score.”  (Id.)  An email that Dr. Noel sent to Dr. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 18 of 28\nCowan, Rich Wenhold, Christopher Oppman,4 and others on February 18, 2016, shows that Noel \nwas guided by the desire to limit the number of inmates who would be eligible for treatment with \nDAAs when he helped to develop the Hepatitis C Protocol:   \nCarl, Thanks for sharing your recommendations on how to update our Hepatitis C \nProtocol.  I do not doubt the elastograhy science or the improvements in defending \nthe Protocol, but I need to operationalize this within our current fiscal realities.  It \ndoes not help us if the use of elastography provides us a bucket of potential patients \nwhich is too large to treat in a timely fashion.5 \n \n(Pls.’ Ex. L.)   \n  We conclude that there is evidence on the record that the DOC’s prioritization of its \ntreatment of inmates with DAAs pursuant to the Hepatitis C Protocol is influenced by the cost of \nthat treatment rather than solely by the medical needs of inmates with chronic HCV and, thus, that \nthe DOC has delayed necessary medical treatment for a non-medical reason.  See Parkell, 833 F.3d \nat 337 (citation omitted). 6   Moreover, there is no record evidence that there is anything to prevent \n                                                 \n  4 Dr. Jay Cowan is the statewide Medical Director for Correct Care Solutions, LLC.  (1st \nAm. Compl.   13; Medical Defs.’ Ans. to 1st Am. Compl.   13.)  Rich Wenhold is the Infection \nControl Coordinator at the DOC.  (Wenhold Decl., Pls.’ Ex. I, ¶ 2.)  Christopher H.

(Id.; Noel Dep. at \n110-11.)  Elastography shows the stiffness or elasticity of the liver and gives a reading that can be \nequated to a fibrosis score of F0 to F4.  (Cowan Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex. L, at 43-44.)  Dr. Cowan is \nof the opinion that elastography is “becoming the kind of a new gold standard . . . in . . . determining \nthe F score.”  (Id. at 44.)  The DOC has purchased an elastography machine, which is located at \nSCI Benner, and which the DOC can use to test up to 15 patients per month.  (Noel Dep. at 113.)  \nThe DOC has no plans to purchase additional elastography machines.  (Id.) \n \n  6 The DOC Defendants argue that reliance on non-medical factors in treatment decisions, \nsuch as cost and administrative convenience, does not equate to deliberate indifference to serious \nmedical needs.  However, “while ‘administrative convenience and cost may be, in appropriate \ncircumstances, permissible factors for correctional systems to consider in making treatment \ndecisions, the Constitution is violated when they are considered to the exclusion of reasonable \nmedical judgment about inmate health.’”  Allah v. Thomas, 679 F. App’x 216, 220 (3d Cir. 2017) \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 19 of 28\nthe DOC from changing the Hepatitis C Protocol after the conclusion of this litigation.  Under \nthese circumstances, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether \nDOC Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of inmates with chronic \nHCV notwithstanding their adoption of the Hepatitis C Protocol.  Accordingly, we decline to grant \nsummary judgment to the DOC Defendants with respect to Count I because the DOC has adopted \nthe Hepatitis C Protocol. \n    b.  Inmates with F0 to F1 fibrosis scores \n  The DOC Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Count I \nbecause those inmates who do not qualify for treatment with DAAs under the Hepatitis C Protocol \ndo not currently have serious medical needs.  The DOC Defendants rely on the report of their \nexpert, Dr. Kendig, who opined that patients with Metavir scores of F0 to F2 “are at low risk for \nrapid progression to severe liver disease, [and] therefore they are not at imminent risk of physical \ninjury without immediate treatment with DAA therapies.”  (Kendig Rpt., DOC Defs.’ Ex. Q, at 5.)  \nDr. Kendig has further opined that prioritizing treatment of DAAs to first treat only inmates with \nMetavir scores of F3-F4 is appropriate: \nThis prioritization approach is warranted in the correctional setting due to the \nenormous number of inmates who have chronic HCV infection; the associated \nlogistical and security challenges for immediately treating all inmates with HCV; \nthe questionable cost effectiveness of immediately treating persons with HCV who \nhave no or minimal liver disease; [and] the very high treatment costs for DAA \ntherapies . . . .   \n \n                                                 \n(quoting Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843, 863 (7th Cir. 2011)).  Since the record contains evidence that \nDr. Noel considered cost to the exclusion of other factors in formulating the Hepatitis C Protocol \n(see Noel Dep. at 82), we conclude that there is record evidence that the DOC Defendants were \ndeliberately indifferent to the medical needs of inmates with HCV in their formulation of the \nHepatitis C Protocol. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 20 of 28\n(Id.)  Dr. Kendig concluded that “the Pennsylvnaia DOC hepatitis C protocol is medically \nappropriate and is consistent with the correctional standard of health care as of July 2017” and that \nthe Hepatitis C Protocol “does not place inmates with chronic HCV infection at a substantial and \nunnecessary risk for severe illness and death.”  (Id.)   \n  The DOC Defendants also contend that their prioritization of inmates for treatment with \nDAAs is not inconsistent with the medical treatment given to individuals infected with HCV \noutside of the correctional setting.  The DOC Defendants rely on evidence that some insurance \ncompanies restrict treatment with DAAs based on “disease severity as measured by Metavir \nScore.”    (Trooskin  Dep.,  DOC  Defs.’  Ex.  T,  at  27.)    In  addition,  prior  to  July  1,  2017, \nPennsylvania’s Medicaid program did not pay for treatment with DAAs for persons infected with \nHCV who had Metavir scores of F1 or F0.  (Id.)   \n  Plaintiffs argue that there is evidence of record that inmates with chronic HCV who have \nMetavir scores of F0 to F2 do have serious medical needs and should be treated with DAAs.  The \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), “recommend[s] treatment for \nall patients with chronic HCV infection, except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be \nremediated by HCV treatment, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy.”  (Pls.’ Ex. C at \n1.)  According to the AASLD, “[p]atients who are cured of their HCV infection experience \nnumerous health benefits, including a decrease in liver inflammation . . . and a reduction in the \nrate of liver fibrosis progression.”  (Id. at 2 (citation omitted).)  In addition, studies reviewed by \nthe AASLD showed that curing HCV, referred to as sustained virologic response (“SVR”), resulted \nin the resolution of cirrhosis in 49% of cases reported, a “70% reduction in the risk of liver cancer,” \nand a “90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality and liver transplantation.”  (Id. (citations \nomitted).)  The AASLD also reported that studies show clear benefits from treating patients at the \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 21 of 28\nearly stages of fibrosis, specifically patients with Metavir scores less than F2.  According to the \nAASLD, “a long-term follow-up study” showed that patients at Metavir stage F0 or F1 fibrosis \nwho achieved SVR and who were followed for up to twenty years had better 15-year survival rates \nthan patients at Metavir stage F0 or F1 who were not treated.  (Id.)  The AASLD has also \nrecognized that “[t]reatment delay may decrease the benefit of SVR.”  (Id.) \n  Dr. Trooskin has opined that patients with Metavir scores below F2 are at risk for serious \nmedical problems if they remain untreated: \nA significant number of persons with chronic HCV who have no or mild fibrosis \n(commonly  described  as  F0-F1)  will  progress  to  cirrhosis  in  the  absence  of \ntreatment.  Currently, there is no way to predict who in this cohort will develop \nadvanced  liver  disease.    Delaying  treatment  for  patients  until  they  develop \nadvanced liver disease leads to significant suffering, increased risk of cancer, need \nfor liver transplants, and death.  Patients who are unable to obtain curative treatment \nare at high risk for anxiety, illness uncertainty (the inability to determine the \nmeaning of illness-related events), and depression, regardless of fibrosis stage.  \nPatients who are cured of HCV report a significant improvement in their mental \nwell-being.  As the disease progresses, so does the risk of a host of medical \nproblems, including HCV-associated heart disease, lymphatic cancers, particularly \nnon-Hodgkin  Lymphoma,  kidney  damage  and  immune  related  rheumatoid \n[arthritis].  Studies show that HCV infection increases the risk of insulin resistance \nand diabetes by almost four times.  Diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer in \npeople living with HCV. . . .  \n \nIndividuals who meet the standards set forth by the AASLD and IDSA, but who \nare excluded from receiving care, are put at a significant risk of many medical \ncomplications  of  HCV.    HCV  is  known  to  have  extrahepatic  manifestations, \ndescribed  as  effects  on  organ  systems  outside  the  liver.    Without  treatment, \nindividuals may be needlessly exposed to depression, fatigue, sore mucles, joint \npain, kidney injury, diabetes or glucose intolerance, certain types of rashes or \nautoimmune diseases.  Without treatment, individuals with HCV are at increased \nrisk of developing cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure requiring transplant.  \nFurthermore, once individuals develop advanced liver disease they must undergo \ncancer screening at regular intervals for the rest of their life even after they are \ncured of their HCV. \n \n(Trooskin Rpt., Pls.’ Ex. A, at 5.)  Dr. Trooskin has also opined that delaying treatment of \nindividuals who have chronic HCV may result in “adverse effects including increasing the risk of \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 22 of 28\ndeath, causing irreversible liver damage, and needlessly prolonging suffering associated with the \ndisease.”  (Id. at 6.)  Delaying treatment with DAAs “can cause damage to other vital organs” and \n“cause heart attacks, fatigue, joint pain, depression, sore muscles, arthritis, and, at times, premature \ndeath.”  (Id. (citation omitted).) \n  Dr. Cowan testified at his deposition that the symptoms exhibited by individuals with \nchronic HCV may not be correlated to their Metavir scores.   (Cowan Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex. L, at \n49-50.)  Individuals with chronic HCV may suffer from extrahepatic and nonhepatic conditions \nsuch as mixed cryoglobulinemia, skin rash, kidney disease, and fatigue.  (Id. at 50-51.)  Moreover, \nindividuals with Metavir scores of F1 may suffer from serious fatigue, anorexia, loss of appetite, \nheadache, jaundice, and ascites (fluid in the abdomen).  (Id. at 52-53.)  Dr. Noel also testified that \nsevere fatigue could be a symptom of HCV at any stage, including F1 and F2.  (Noel Dep., DOC \nDefs.’ Ex. K, at 125, 142.)  Dr. Kendig has also testified that “fatigue has been associated with \nHepatitis C at all stages” and that patients can suffer from extrahepatic manifestations of chronic \nHCV when their Metavir scores are F0 and F1.  (Kendig Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex. R, at 39-40.)   \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the DOC is deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs \nof inmates with chronic HCV because it is prioritizing patients based on imprecise tests that may \nmiss patients who may otherwise be entitled to treatment with DAAs under the Hepatitis C \nProtocol.   As we discussed earlier, both Dr. Noel and Dr. Cowan acknowledge that APRI scores \nare only indirect markers of fibrosis and APRI scores at the 1.5 to 2 level only have “a sensitivity \naccuracy of about 48 percent.”  (Cowan Dep. at 42; see also Noel Decl., DOC Defs.’ Ex. N,   23.)  \nConsequently, using APRI scores could mean missing cirrhosis in half of inmates with ¶APRI \nscores at the 1.5 to 2 level.  (Cowan Dep. at 42.)  In addition, an APRI score of 1 would miss \napproximately 23% of patients with cirrhosis.  (Cowan Dep. at 42-43.)   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 23 of 28\n  We conclude that the record contains evidence that patients who have chronic HCV and \nwhose Metavir scores are less than F2 have serious medical needs, as they may suffer from fatigue \nand other nonhepatic symptoms of their infections and, if not treated with DAAs before their \ndisease progresses, may suffer from liver inflammation, liver fibrosis, liver cancer and liver-related \nmortality that they would not suffer if they were treated with DAAs while their Metavir scores are \nin the F0 to F1 range.  See Tsakonas, 308 F. App’x at 632.  There is also evidence that the DOC’s \nreliance on an inaccurate method of testing for fibrosis could result in the DOC’s failing to treat \nmany individuals who suffer from advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.  Based on all of the above, we \nfurther conclude that there is record evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding \nwhether inmates who have chronic HCV but whose APRI scores do not yet correlate to Metavir \nscores of F3 and F4 have serious medical needs that the DOC Defendants are deliberately refusing \nto treat for non-medical reasons, such as cost.  Accordingly, we deny the DOC Defendants’ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment insofar as they argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Count \nI because inmates who have been categorized as having Metavir scores of F0 to F1 do not have \nserious medical needs.   \nB.  Count II \n  The DOC Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Count II, in \nwhich Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief for alleged violations of Article I, Section 13 of the \nPennsylvania Constitution, because the Commonwealth has not waived its immunity as to this \nclaim.7  The DOC Defendants rely on Pennsylvania’s sovereign immunity statute, which provides \nas follows: \n                                                 \n  7 Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that “Excessive bail shall not be \nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel punishments inflicted.”  Pa.

We conclude that Pennsylvania has not waived its \nsovereign immunity with respect to Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief for violation of Article I, \nSection 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and we grant the Motion for Summary Judgment as \nto Count II of the First Amended Complaint. \n   \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 25 of 28\nC.  Count III \n  The DOC Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Chimenti’s \nmedical malpractice claim in Count III of the First Amended Complaint because the evidence of \nrecord is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between their alleged failure to conform \nto the appropriate standard of care and injury to Chimenti.  To succeed on a medical malpractice \nclaim, a plaintiff “is required to establish ‘that 1) the medical practitioner owed a duty to [him]; 2) \nthe practitioner breached that duty; 3) the breach was the proximate cause of, or a substantial factor \nin, bringing about the harm [that he suffered]; and 4) the damages suffered were the direct result \nof the harm.’”   Osborne v.

The Pennsylvania \nSuperior Court has explained that “‘an expert fails this standard of certainty if he testifies that the \nalleged cause possibly, or could have[,] led to the result, that it could very properly account for the \nresult, or even that it was very highly probable that it caused the result.’”  Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting Kravinsky v. Glover, 396 A.2d 1349, 1356 (Pa. Super.

(Pls.’ Ex. Q.)  Dr. Cecil \nhas expressed the following opinions with “a reasonable degree of medical certainty.”  (Id.)   \nMr. Chimenti was treated with triple therapy but relapsed necessitating retreatment.  \nA new treatment was available in October 2013 with Sovaldi but Mr. Chimenti was \nnot  allowed  to  have  this  new  treatment.    He  should  have  taken  Sovaldi, \npeginterferon and ribavirin at that time.  Sovaldi plus Olysio combination therapy \nwere also available but this was also denied.  The Department of Corrections should \nhave referred him to a hepatologist then but did not.  They also refused to send him \nto a gastroenterologist.  His medical practitioners were not qualified to treat him \nand his case reflects their errors.  \n \nHarvoni was FDA approved in October 2014 and again Mr. Chimenti was denied \ntreatment.  He had life threatening cirrhosis and denial of Harvoni represents \ndeliberate indifference to his life.  Lack of treatment injured him and increased his \nrisk of death, liver cancer, worseing [sic] of liver failure and increased the need for \na liver transplant in the future. \n \nIn 2015 a liver mass suspicious for liver cancer was found on a scan.  The standard \nof care required referral to a liver cancer specialist and not a general oncologist.  He \nwas pressured into agreeing to a liver biopsy.  No biopsy meant no treatment.  This \nviolated his human rights.  The radiologist refused to do the biopsy.  The liver lesion \nhas not enlarged and is not considered a liver cancer at this time.  There was no \nmedical reason to delay Harvoni while waiting for a liver biopsy.  That is not the \nstandard of medical care. \n \nHarvoni cured his HCV two years late and the delay irreparately [sic] worsened Mr. \nChimenti.  He has diabetes now likely related to his HCV.  He has severe fatigue, \nmemory problems related to hepatic encephalopathy. \n \nThe department of corrections ignored the clear national standards published by the \nAmerican  Association  for  the  Study  of  Liver  Diseases.    They  improperly \nmismanaged his life threatening medical condition instead of making a timely \nreferrral [sic] to a hepatologist.   \n \n(Id.)  We conclude that Dr. Cecil’s opinion satisfies the standard of certainty except with respect \nto his statement that Chimenti’s diabetes is “likely related to his HCV” (id.), as this statement fails \nto comply with the requisite standard of certainty for causation.  See McLeod, 2014 WL 4634962, \nat *4 (quotation omitted). \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 27 of 28\n  The  DOC  Defendants  also  argue  that  they  are  entitled  to  summary  judgment  as  to \nChimenti’s medical malpractice claim because Dr. Cecil’s report does not specify what actions Dr. \nNoel took with respect to Chimenti’s medical care.  The DOC Defendants, however, cite no \nauthority for the proposition that a medical malpractice plaintiff must establish duty and breach of \nthat duty solely through expert testimony and we are aware of none.  Plaintiffs have submitted \nevidence that Dr. Noel was involved in the development of the DOC’s interim and final Hepatitis \nC Protocols and the decision of the DOC to cease all treatment for HCV before it developed a \ntreatment protocol.  (Noel Dep., DOC Defs.’ Ex K, at 31, 65-66, 68-70; Noel Decl., DOC Defs.’ \nEx. N,   4-5.)  There is also record evidence that Dr. Noel had the final authority to determine \nwhether¶ ¶a particular inmate received DAA treatment, that medical staff consulted him regarding \nwhether to provide DAA treatment to Chimenti, and that he was involved in the decision not to \nprovide DAA treatment to Chimenti.  (Noel Dep. at 154-56, 173, 176-78, 183-84, 187.)  We \nconclude, accordingly, that there is sufficient evidence on the record to raise a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact regarding whether Dr. Noel owed a duty to Chimenti; whether Dr. Noel breached that \nduty through his involvement in the decision to delay Chimenti’s treatment with DAAs; and \nwhether that breach was a substantial factor in causing Chimenti to suffer severe fatigue, memory \nproblems and increased risk of death, liver cancer, worsening of liver failure and an increased need \nfor a liver transplant in the future.  See Osborne, 59 A.3d at 1114-15 (quotation omitted).  We \ntherefore grant the DOC Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count III of the First \nAmended Complaint with respect to Dr. Cecil’s opinion that the DOC’s failure to treat Chimenti \nwith DAAs in 2013 and 2014 was likely to have caused his diabetes and we deny the DOC’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment as to Count III of the First Amended Complaint in all other \nrespects. \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 109   Filed 07/12/18   Page 28 of 28\nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated  above, we  grant the DOC Defendants’ Motion for  Summary \nJudgment as to the following:  (1) Maldonado’s personal claim for injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 in Count I of the First Amended Complaint; (2) Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief \nfor violation of Article I, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution in Count II of the First \nAmended Complaint; and (3) that portion of Chimenti’s claim for medical malpractice in Count \nIII of the First Amended Complaint that pertains to Dr. Cecil’s opinion that Chimenti’s diabetes is \nlikely related to his HCV.  The Motion for Summary Judgment is denied in all other respects.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs may proceed with respect to their claims against the DOC Defendants for \ninjunctive relief on behalf of Chimenti, Leyva, and the Class in Count I; Chimenti’s claim for \nmonetary damages in Count I; and the remainder of Chimenti’s claim for medical malpractice in \nCount III.

The DOC does not admit to any violation of law and does not admit to any \nwrongdoing that was or could have been alleged by the Plaintiffs.  No part of this Agreement, \nincluding its statements and commitments, shall constitute evidence of any liability, fault, or \nwrongdoing by the DOC or the DOC defendants. \nWHEREAS, this Agreement is made without trial or adjudication of any issue of \nfact or law or finding of wrongdoing or liability of any kind.  It is the intent of the parties that \nthis Agreement shall not create a private cause of action or confer any right to any third party for \nviolation of any federal or state statute. \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the parties, as follows: \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 4 of 29\nDEFINITIONS \nAs used in this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings: \n1.  The “Hepatitis C Protocol” refers to the current 2018 DOC Hepatitis C Protocol, \nand any superseding Protocol(s) promulgated by the DOC.  See Exhibit A. \n2.  The “Preliminary Approval Date” is the date on which the U.S. District Court \ngives preliminary approval to this Agreement. \n3.  The “Effective Date” means the date upon which the District Court gives final                \napproval to this Settlement Agreement. \n4.         “Class members” refers to all current and future inmates in the DOC with Chronic \nHepatitis C, but only for the duration of the Agreement. \n5.  “DAA” refers to the class of medications known as FDA-approved Direct-Acting \nAntivirals used to treat Hepatitis C. \n6.        “Eligible Inmates” shall include all inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C who do not \naffirmatively reject DAA treatment, have at least one year’s life expectancy, have \na release date from the DOC at least twenty (20) weeks in the future, and for \nwhom DAA treatment is not contraindicated under the terms of the Hepatitis C \nProtocol.  \nAGREEMENT \nIn consideration of the mutual terms, covenants, conditions and releases of this \nSettlement Agreement, the parties agree as follows:  \n1.  Replacement of the Hepatitis C Protocol \nNo later than sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, the DOC shall replace the current \nHepatitis C Protocol with a new Hepatitis C Protocol that incorporates and reflects the terms of \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 5 of 29\nthis Settlement Agreement.  The DOC shall be responsible for informing its staff, correctional \nhealth care providers, and outside medical providers of the new Hepatitis C Protocol.   \n2.  Medical Evaluation and Treatment for Identified Affected Inmates \nPursuant to this Settlement Agreement and the Hepatitis C Protocol, the DOC shall \nprovide DAA to inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C on the following schedule: \na.  Upon the Preliminary Approval of this Agreement, all eligible inmates with a \nMetavir Fibrosis Score of F-2, F-3, or F-4, as determined by the testing standards \nset forth in the Hepatitis C Protocol, including consideration of APRI scores and \nFibrosure tests, and named Plaintiff Daniel Leyva, shall be treated with DAA no \nlater than six months following the DOC determination of their F-2, F-3 or F-4 \nFibrosis Score, as more fully defined, para. 3, infra.   \n \nb.  Starting July 1, 2019, and for each of the following two years to June 30, 2021, \nthe DOC shall treat no fewer than 1500 eligible inmates each year with DAA, \nbased on the priority provisions of the DOC Hepatitis C Protocol.  For the year, \nJuly 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the DOC shall treat 2000 eligible inmates with \nDAA, based on the priority provisions of the DOC Hepatitis C Protocol.  These \nrequirements shall be suspended if and when the DAA treatments exhaust the \nentire pool of eligible inmates. \n \nc.  The DOC shall implement the priority treatment provisions of this Agreement and \nthe DOC Hepatitis C Protocol based on the APRI and Fibrosure scores set forth in \nsection 3, infra, and absent exigent circumstances, shall treat eligible inmates with \nthe higher scores first, without regard to their release dates. \n \nd.  In the period from May 1 to July 1, 2022, the parties shall confer on a schedule \nfor treating the eligible inmates not yet provided with DAA treatment, and to \ndiscuss termination of this Agreement.  The parties agree that if the number of \neligible inmates as of January 1, 2022 does not exceed 500, that none of these \ninmates have a Metavir Fibrosis Score of more than F-0, as defined in this \nAgreement, and that none of the eligible inmates have been awaiting DAA \ntreatment for more than six months following documentation of their Chronic \nHepatitis C status under the DOC Protocol, the Agreement shall be terminated as \nof June 30, 2022. \n \ne.  If these conditions are not satisfied, the parties shall negotiate a continuing \ntreatment schedule and termination date.  If the parties are unable to reach an \nAgreement, the Court, after hearing, may intervene to determine the schedule for \nDAA treatments going forward, and shall determine the termination date for the \nAgreement and for the Court’s jurisdiction over this case.   \n  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 6 of 29\n3.   Hepatitis C Metavir Fibrosis Score Testing \n \n The DOC shall determine the Metavir Fibrosis Score referenced in this Settlement \nAgreement and the Hepatitis C Protocol using the following tests: \na.  Initially, the Fibrosis Score shall be determined by the APRI test score, with the \nfollowing designations: APRI score of 2.0 or above, F-4; APRI score of more than \n1.5-2.0, F-3; APRI score of more than 0.7-1.5, F-2; APRI score of more than 0.5-0.7, \nF-1; APRI score of less than 0.5, F-0; all subject to the provisions of 3(c) and (d). \n \nb.  Where Fibrosure is used to determine the Metavir Fibrosis Score (“Score”), the \nfollowing designations shall be made:  Less than 0.21, Score of F-0; 0.21-0.27, Score, \nF-0-F-1; 0.27-0.31, Score, F-1; 0.31-0.48, Score F-1-F-2; 0.48-0.58, Score F-2; 0.58-\n0.72, Score F-3; 0.72-0.74, Score F-3-F-4; greater than 0.74, Score F-4. \n \nc.  If the APRI and Fibrosure tests result in different Metavir Fibrosis Scores, the \nFibrosure Score shall control. \n \nd.  Fibrosis Score evaluations of class members at F-0 to F-2 shall be made every six \nmonths, as set forth in the Hepatitis C Protocol. \n \n4.  Preventive Health and Patient Education \nThe class members shall be evaluated to assess the need for preventive health \ninterventions such as vaccines and screenings for other conditions, as well as counseled with \ninformation on Hepatitis C infection.  All inmates who are positive for the Hepatitis C virus shall \nbe evaluated to assess the need for the preventive health interventions in accordance with DOC \npolicies on preventive health visits, including: \n●  Hepatitis B vaccine:  Indicated for susceptible class members with \nChronic Hepatitis C infection.  The DOC shall consider blood test \nprescreening for Hepatitis B immunity prior to vaccination. \n \n●  Class members with evidence of liver disease shall be priority candidates \nfor a Hepatitis B vaccination. \n \n●  Hepatitis A vaccine:  Indicated for susceptible class members with \nChronic Hepatitis C infection.  The DOC shall consider blood test \nprescreening for Hepatitis A immunity prior to vaccination. \n \n●  Influenza vaccine:  Offer to all class members annually. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 7 of 29\n \n●  Class members with cirrhosis shall be high priority for an influenza \nvaccine. \n \nClass members shall be counseled by a health care provider regarding the natural history \nof the infection, potential treatment options, and specific measures to prevent transmitting \nHepatitis C infection to others (both during incarceration and upon release), consistent with DOC \npolicies on preventive health visits and other policies.  Class members have the right to refuse \nDAA treatment, but they shall be counseled by a health care provider regarding the risks of \nrefusing treatment and the benefits of DAA treatment.  These class members shall continue to be \nmonitored under the terms of the Hepatitis C Protocol and may request DAA treatment at any \ntime during the course or their incarceration.  Upon such a request, the class member shall be \nprovided DAA treatment under the terms of paras. 2 and 3, supra.  \nThe DOC shall provide all class members who do not receive DAA treatment, before \ntheir release from custody, with pertinent information about their Hepatitis C condition and \naccess to DAA treatment upon release through Medicaid or other state or local programs, \nincluding information provided by counsel for the Plaintiff Class.   \n5.          Class Definition \nThe definition of the class that was certified by the Court on May 24, 2018 shall be \namended to include inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C who enter the DOC after the date of class \ncertification.  The class shall be defined as follows: \nAll persons who are currently incarcerated in a Pennsylvania Department of Corrections \n(“DOC”) facility, or who are incarcerated in the DOC in the future, with a diagnosis of  \nChronic Hepatitis C, who have a release date from the DOC that is at least twenty (20) \nweeks in the future, who have a life expectancy of over one year, and for whom DAA \ntreatment is not contraindicated under the terms of the Hepatitis C Protocol.   \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 8 of 29\nThe class shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement only for the duration of the \nAgreement. \n6.  Notice to Inmates \nThe DOC shall provide notice to all class members of this Settlement Agreement \nby: \n  Making regular audio and video announcements at each DOC facility \nequipped with a CCTV system and/or prison-wide intercom system for a \nfourteen (14) day period beginning within thirty (30) days of the Effective \nDate;  \n  If a DOC facility has neither a prison-wide intercom nor a CCTV system, \nDOC shall provide each class member with a written version of the \nannouncement; \n  Posting a copy of this Agreement in each medical facility accessible to \ninmates for a period of at least two (2) years; \n  Posting a copy of this Agreement in each library accessible to class \nmembers for the period of this Agreement; and \n  Providing class members with a letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel explaining \nthe Agreement and access to DAA treatment. \n7.  Monitoring Period \nFor a period that begins with the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending with the \ntermination of the Agreement, the DOC shall on a quarterly basis provide Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwith reports to permit monitoring of the implementation of the Agreement.  These reports shall \ninclude the data currently maintained on the DOC Hepatitis C Spreadsheets regarding testing, \ndiagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of all class members diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis C in \nthe DOC, and the class members’ Metavir Fibrosis Scores by date determined, and scheduled \ndates for DAA treatment.  The Spreadsheets, or other documentation, shall also include (a) \ninformation regarding all inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C who, because of any exclusionary \npolicy or reason, is not being provided DAA; (b) the specific reason(s) for non-treatment with \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 9 of 29\nDAA; and (c) the dates of entry into and release from the DOC of eligible inmates not provided \nwith DAA treatment during their incarceration. \n8.  Notice and Comment to Future Changes to the Hepatitis C Protocol \nDuring the period of this agreement (pre-termination), the DOC shall provide Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel with a copy of any proposed revisions or changes to the Hepatitis C Protocol.  Such \nproposed revisions or changes shall not be placed into effect without Plaintiffs’ counsel being \ngiven an opportunity to provide comments on the changes and, if invoked, until the conclusion of \nthe Dispute Resolution procedure identified below. \n9.  Dispute Resolution \nIf Plaintiffs’ counsel believe that the DOC has improperly denied a class member \nmedically necessary DAA, failed to comply with the terms of this Settlement Agreement, or \nproposed revisions or changes to the Hepatitis C Protocol that are inconsistent with the \nSettlement Agreement, Plaintiffs’ counsel will provide the DOC with a notice of potential non-\ncompliance.  This notice will identify, with particularity, the basis of the claim that the DOC is \nnot in compliance and the specific material provision of the Settlement Agreement or Hepatitis C \nProtocol that is implicated. \nWithin thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification, the DOC shall provide a good-faith \nwritten response to the Plaintiffs’ notification with a full factual explanation as to why the DOC \nbelieves it is in compliance with the specified material provisions, or an explanation of the \nDOC’s plans to achieve full compliance with the specified material provisions.   \nIt is understood between the parties that certain unforeseeable events or conditions, for \nexample, long-term lockdowns in the DOC, changes adopted by the AASLD/IDSA regarding \nmedical treatment for persons with Chronic Hepatitis C, or changes in FDA regulations, may \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 125-2   Filed 11/19/18   Page 10 of 29\nprevent compliance with this Agreement.  If so, the DOC shall notify Plaintiffs’ counsel of the \nevent or condition and the parties shall enter into good-faith discussions to resolve the issues. \nIf the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of DOC’s response, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel may seek intervention from the Court by filing a motion for specific \nperformance of the material provision identified through the aforementioned Dispute Resolution \nprocedure.  The Court may order specific performance of the material provision upon a showing \nthat the DOC is in substantial non-compliance with the material provision specified in the notice. \nThe Court may not entertain a motion for contempt and the Court may not grant any remedial \nrelief in the nature of a contempt of court finding against the Department.  However, if the \nDepartment does not comply with an order for specific performance, the Court may order \nadditional equitable relief, including extending the term of this Agreement in one (1) year \nincrements.  In no event, may the Court extend the term of this Agreement beyond five (5) years \nfrom the Effective Date of this Agreement.  \n10.  Preliminary Approval \nAs soon as practicable following execution of this Agreement, the parties shall apply to \nthe Court for a preliminary order: \na.  Granting Preliminary Approval of this Agreement for purposes of disseminating \nnotice to current DOC prisoners who are Class Members; \n \nb.  Approving the form, contents, and dissemination of the Notice of this Agreement \nto current DOC prisoners who are Class Members; and \n \nc.

Dismissal \nThe parties understand and agree that the Court will maintain jurisdiction of this civil \naction throughout the duration of the Agreement to enforce the provisions of the Agreement and \nthat the Plaintiffs may seek to enforce the Agreement, pursuant to paragraph 9, supra.

P. 4l (a), thereby ending the Court’s \njurisdiction over this case. \n13.  No Admission of Liability \nNeither this Settlement Agreement nor anything in this Settlement Agreement shall be \ndeemed an admission or concession of liability or evidence respecting any liability on the part of \nthe DOC Defendants or an admission that any of Plaintiffs’ claims lack merit. \nNeither this Agreement nor any policies or procedures referenced herein shall define any \nstate or federal constitutional rights. \n14.

The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC), by policy and practice, \nsystemically denies necessary medical care for inmates diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis C viral \ninfections, thereby placing them at substantial and unnecessary risk for severe illness and death.  \nSince 2014, with the approval by the Federal Drug Administration of  Direct \nActing Anti- D  is available for persons with Hepatitis C, with no \nadverse side-effects.  Major medical associations, Medicare, the Veterans Administration, and \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 2 of 21\nprivate health insurance companies provide DAAD to all persons with chronic Hepatitis C.  Yet, \nthe DOC rations these drugs in an arbitrary manner, and refuses to provide DAAD treatment to \nover 98% of inmates with chronic Hepatitis C in the DOC.  The denial of these drugs is based \nsolely on their costs, and without any medical justification.    \n2.  Plaintiffs Salvatore Chimenti, Daniel Leyva, and David Maldonado are \nincarcerated in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections with serious health complications \nstemming from their Hepatitis C viral infections.  The Defendants have refused to provide \nnecessary medical treatment to Plaintiffs and others incarcerated in the DOC with Hepatitis C \ninfections that is mandated by prevailing community medical standards and the Constitutions and \nlaws of the United States and Pennsylvania.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves \nand a class of similarly-situated plaintiffs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state laws against \nthe DOC, prison officials, and medical providers for depriving them of their rights guaranteed by \nthe Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania \nConstitution, and Pennsylvania Law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Eighth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  The Court has \nsupplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C 1367(a) to adjudicate the Pennsylvania state law and \nconstitutional claims.   \n4.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(g) since \nsubstantial events at issue in this litigation occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 3 of 21\n \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff Salvatore Chimenti is an adult individual currently incarcerated at the \nPennsylvania State Correctional Institution at Smithfield (SCI Smithfield).  Mr. Chimenti sues \nfor injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of plaintiffs \nwho are currently or will in the future be subject to Defendant DOC s discriminatory and \nunconstitutional policy for treating Hepatitis C infections.  Mr. Chimenti also seeks money \ndamages for the longstanding violations of his right to medical care. \n6.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection, primarily spread through contact with infected \nblood that attacks the liver and causes hepatitis, or liver inflammation, which can significantly \nimpair  in digesting essential nutrients, filter toxins from the \nblood, and prevent disease. \n18.  Hepatitis C infections are of multiple genotypes and can be of an acute or chronic \nnature.  An acute infection, a short-term illness, occurs within the first six months of exposure to \nthe virus and, for most persons exposed to the virus, leads to chronic Hepatitis C infection.  \n19.  Chronic Hepatitis C infections are serious, long-term illnesses that can last \nHepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 6 of 21\nliver tissue) and liver cancer and is the most common cause of liver transplants. Chronic \nHepatitis C infection can cause serious chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis (scarring of liver \ntissue), and death, as well as extrahepatic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, fatigue, \ndepression, muscle and nerve damage, nausea, and problems with concentration and memory.  \nFor persons with chronic Hepatitis C, each day without treatment increases the likelihood of \nthese conditions. \n20.  Hepatitis C is the leading infectious disease killer in the United States, killing \nnearly 20,000 persons annually of the more than five million persons with Hepatitis C (a death \nrate greater than the next sixty infectious diseases combined). \n21.  Liver transplants are painful, carry a risk of significant complications, are nearly \nimpossible for prisoners to obtain, and result in lower recovery rates than treatment with direct-\nacting antiviral drugs.  \n22.  By not providing necessary medical care,  cause immediate and \nsubstantial risks to Plaintiffs and those similarly situated with death and other irreparable harm \nstemming from their chronic Hepatitis C infections. Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \nclass, which number more than 5,400 inmates, have suffered and will continue to suffer grave \nand irreparable harm unless the Court orders Defendants to provide the safe and effective \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs as described below.  \nStandard of Care for Hepatitis C Infections \n23.  For many years, finding and establishing an effective and safe treatment for \nHepatitis C infections was a highly elusive goal.  The standard treatment, which included the use \nof interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure large numbers of patients and was \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 7 of 21\nassociated with painful and other adverse side-effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune \ndisorders, flulike symptoms, and gastrointestinal distress.  \n24.  Over the past three years, the approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) \nof new  DAAD, including Sovaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, has revolutionized the \ntreatment module for Hepatitis C infections. \n25.  Sovaldi, Olysio, and Harvoni, properly administered, have no adverse side-effects \nand are highly effective in creating a sustained viral response and a full cure of Hepatitis C \ninfection. \n26.  The DAAD treatment modules have very high cure rates (over 90% of patients \ntreated for Sovaldi and over 95% for Harvoni) and require a short treatment period of 8-12 \nweeks. \n27.  The standard of care in the community for Hepatitis C infections the use of the \nDAAD is now well-established.  These new treatment modules have been recommended for \ntreatment of all persons with Chronic Hepatitis C by the American Association for the Study of \n, \nDisease Control, Medicare, many medical systems, the Veterans Administration, and most \nprivate medical insurers.  No other treatments are recommended or in use for persons with \nChronic Hepatitis C.  \nPennsylvania DOC Policy for Hepatitis C Infections \n28.  From 2013, when the FDA first approved the use of DAAD to the current date, \nDefendants failed to promulgate and implement treatment policies or provide medical treatment \nfor all inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C infections consistent with medical and community \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 8 of 21\nstandards, and specifically the Defendants failed to authorize treatment with the effective DAAD \nfor the vast majority of inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C. \n29.  The DOC has formulated a Hepatitis C medical care and treatment process \npursuant to the DOC  .  The Protocol \nestablishes final policy and practices for Hepatitis C treatment for inmates, and creates a \nrationing system for treatment of inmates with DAAD. \n30.  As formulated and implemented, the Protocol arbitrarily denies necessary, \nappropriate, and constitutionally mandated DAAD treatment to over 98% of inmates with \nChronic Hepatitis C, in direct conflict with community health standards.  Plaintiffs and members \nof plaintiff class are thus denied drugs that would effectuate a full cure of their disease. \n31.  Chronic Hepatitis C is diagnosed on a fibrosis level scale of F-0 to F-4, with \nlevels F-0 and F-1 including persons with early stage chronic Hepatitis C, of whom over 70%, if \nnot treated with DAAD, will progress to serious fibrosis and, of that group, 30% will develop \ncirrhosis of the liver.  All persons with Chronic Hepatitis C risk liver cancer, liver failure, \ndiabetes, heart failure, kidney disease, and serious physical and mental pain and suffering. \n32.  As a consequence, Plaintiffs and all class members with Hepatitis C infections \nhave a substantially increased risk of continued Hepatitis C infection, liver disease, liver cancer, \ncirrhosis, extra-hepatic diseases and conditions, and death.  Defenda D \nforces Plaintiffs and the plaintiff class to endure chronic inflammatory disease, pain, fatigue, \nincreased risks of cancer, liver failure, heart attacks, and death, before any DAAD treatment is \nprovided. \n33.  There is no medical justification for a treatment module for Hepatitis C infection \nthat does not provide DAAD to all inmates with chronic Hepatitis C, except for those with very \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 9 of 21\nshort life expectancy or release dates less than three months from the start of DAAD treatment.  \nTo the extent that DAAD treatment is not provided because of financial considerations, the \npractice is unconstitutional and otherwise in violation of the United States Constitution, the \nPennsylvania Constitution, and Pennsylvania state law as they deny necessary and appropriate \nmedical care to Plaintiff and members of the class. \n34.  In Mumia Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 3:16-CV-2000, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 368 (M.D. \nPa. January 3, 2017), the court ruled that the Protocol in unconstitutional as written and applied, \nand stated: \nThe Hepatitis C Protocol, in both how it is written and how it is implemented, \nbars those without vast fibrosis or cirrhosis from being approved for treatment \nwith DAA medications.  As such, the Hepatitis C Protocol presents a conscious \ndisregard of a known risk that inmates with fibrosis, like Plaintiff, will suffer from \nhepatitis C related complications, continued liver scarring and damage \nprogressing into cirrhosis, and from cirrhosis related complications such as \nascites, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and esophageal varicies. \n \nThe Hepatitis C Protocol deliberately delays treatment for Hepatitis C through the \nadministration of DAA drugs such as Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Viekira Pak despite \nthe knowledge of Defendants that sit on the Hepatitis C Treatment Committee:  \n(1) that the aforesaid DAA medications will effect a cure of Hepatitis C in 90 to \n95 percent of the cases that disease; and (2) that the substantial delay in treatment \nthat is inherent in the current protocol is likely to reduce the efficacy of these \nmedications and thereby prolong the suffering of those who have been diagnosed \nwith chronic Hepatitis C and allow the progression of the disease to accelerate so \nthat it presents a greater threat of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death of \nthe inmate with such disease.   \n \nId. at *30-31 (internal numbering omitted) \n \nPlaintiff Salvatore Chimenti \n35.  Mr. Chimenti entered the DOC in 1983, and is currently incarcerated at SCI \nSmithfield. \n36.  In 1991, while Mr. Chimenti was housed at SCI Huntingdon, the medical staff \ninformed Mr. Chimenti that he had tested positive for Hepatitis C.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 10 of 21\n37.  Mr. Chimenti received interferon treatments from December 1, 1997 to March 18, \n1998, but these treatments did not provide a cure for the disease.  \n38.  In May 1998, a gastrointestinal specialist, Michael F. Gaugler, D.O., \nrecommended consideration of a treatment module for Mr. Chimenti of interferon in \ncombination with ribavirin, and that treatment module was approved by the FDA in or about \nJune 1998. \n39.  The DOC took 18 months to develop a protocol from 1998 to 2000, and therefore, \nMr. Chimenti did not begin the combination treatment with interferon and ribavirin (combined \ntogether and branded as Rebetron) until June 2000, but once again his condition did not improve \nwith this six-month treatment.  \n40.  During this time while waiting for the Rebetron treatment for Hepatitis C, Mr. \nthus reducing his chance of \nresponding positively to that treatment by 50 percent. \n41.  In 2011, after FDA approved a triple therapy treatment using boceprevir or \ntelaprevir in combination with interferon and ribavirin, Mr. Chimenti again sought to have his \nHepatitis C treated. \n42.  After waiting 10 months, Mr. Chimenti was treated with triple therapy at SCI \nForest from June 2012 through May 2013.  He initially responded positively to the triple therapy, \nbut relapsed six months later in November 2013. \n43.  Mr. Chimenti now suffers from Stage 4 compensated cirrhosis with chronic liver \nfailure.  His Model for End-Stage Liver Disease ( ) score is 12.  The MELD score is a \nmeasure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and is used as a disease severity \nindex to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 11 of 21\n44.  In 2009, Dr. Abhinav Humar, Chief Liver Transplant Specialist from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center was appointed by U.S. District Court Judge Vanaskie to \nHumar recommended that Mr. \nChimenti be assessed with ultrasounds and CT scans of his liver every six months, and that if \ntologist for the \npossibility of a liver transplant. \n45.  Since November 2013, Defendants, including Dr. Kephart, Dr. Frommer, and Dr. \nNoel, continually denied and delayed the necessary treatment to track and halt the deleterious \neffects of Hepatitis C, including regular ultrasounds and CT scans, which are medically \nnecessary for individuals with Stage 4 cirrhosis, and the provision of DAAD. \n46.  Defendants, including Kephart, Frommer, Noel, Correct Care Solutions, and \nWexford Health Source, failed with deliberate indifference to have Mr. Chimenti seen or \nevaluated by a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for proper treatment of his liver condition. \n47.  In late 2013, Mr. Chimenti began requesting treatment of his Hepatitis C infection \nwith direct-acting antiviral drugs, but he has been denied and delayed this treatment by \nDefendants, even though the standard of community care at that time required that Mr. Chimenti \nbe prescribed Sovadi with ribavirin, which has an over 90% cure rate. \n48.  In November 2014, CHCA Dreibelbis informe\n \n49.  In late 2014 and early 2015, emails were exchanged between Dr. Noel, Dr. Dean \nRieger (Deputy Chief Clinical Officer of CCS), and Dr. Kephart (with others sometimes copied \non the email, including Dr. Hochberg, Mr. Dreibelbis, and Mr. Oppman), discussing Mr. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 12 of 21\nChimenti s medical treatment, and deciding that Mr. Chimenti should merely be monitored and \nthat there was no urgency in providing the latest DAAD medication treatment. \n50.  In Dr. Kephart s role as the former Medical Director and in Dr. Frommer s \ncurrent role as the Medical Director at SCI Smithfield, they each review(ed) and approve(d) all \nrequests for referrals to outside providers and outside medical treatment for Mr. Chimenti, and \nreceive(d) and/or review(ed) many or all reports from those outside medical providers, including \nthose related to Mr. Chimenti s Hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and related conditions. \n51.  In the fall of  Defendants, and in \nparticular Defendant Dr. Frommer, insisted that Mr. Chimenti undergo a liver biopsy before \nproviding any further treatment or referring Mr. Chimenti to a hepatologist (and/or a transplant \nhepatologist), even though a biopsy is no longer recommended as part of the standard of care due \nto the risk of bleeding and seeding.  While Mr. Chimenti initially declined the biopsy due to the \nnoted risks of such biopsy, he ultimately consented to a liver biopsy.  However, subsequently \ntwo separate radiologists on two occasions, in fact, determined that a liver biopsy would be too \ndangerous for Mr. Chimenti, due to the location of the mass.  The standard of care provides that \na patient can and should be evaluated for both DAAD and the possibility of liver cancer at the \nsame time.   \n52.  In approximately March 2016, Mr. Chimenti had a meeting with numerous \nmedical staff, including Dr. Frommer, Mr. Dreibelbis, Dr. Dolphin, J. Hartman (RNS), and Mega \nPfiel (PAC), regarding his Hepatitis C and related medical conditions.  At that time, the medical \npersonnel agreed to recommend DAAD treatment and referral to a hepatologist (specifically a \ntransplant hepatologist), and upon information and belief, this recommendation and request was \nsent to Central Office but denied. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 13 of 21\n53.  As Defendants delayed and denied providing DAAD to Mr. Chimenti, he suffered \nfrom symptoms of chronic Hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and a failing liver, including but not limited to \nhypertension, jaundice, confusion, bad odor, and poor laboratory test results measuring bilirubin, \nenzyme, and platelet levels. \n54.  Despite Mr. Chimenti having stage 4 cirrhosis, the most advanced stage, it was \nnot until in or around July 2016 that he was referred to a hepatologist for an evaluation since he \nhad been returned to SCI Smithfield from SCI Forest in 2013, and it was not until October 2016 \nthat he finally received the DAAD treatment. \n55.  Mr. Chimenti has fully grieved the denial of his request for this form of medical \ntreatment, as well as the lack of any treatment for his Hepatitis C or cirrhosis. \n56.  As a result of Defendant  denial and continual delay of the necessary medical \ntreatment, Mr. Chimenti continued to suffer from chronic Hepatitis C infection, advanced \ncirrhosis, and the related risks of liver failure and death, and physical and emotional pain and \nsuffering. \n57.  Furthermore, his liver continued to deteriorate and a mass developed in his liver \nduring the time period of the denial and delay of necessary medical treatment for his Hepatitis C, \nand is still at risk for needing a liver transplant. \n58.  The refusal, with deliberate indifference, of Defendants to provide Mr. Chimenti \nand other class members with Hepatitis C infections with access to the necessary and appropriate \nDAAD and other medical services for the treatment of their Hepatitis C infections constitutes a \nviolation of the Eight Amendment, the Pennsylvania Constitution, and Pennsylvania state law. \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 14 of 21\nPlaintiff Daniel Leyva \n59.  Plaintiff Daniel Leyva is currently incarcerated at SCI Retreat. \n60.  Mr. Leyva was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2001 or 2002 while he was \nincarcerated at SCI Albion. \n61.  Previously he had been treated with interferon and ribavirin, but it was \nunsuccessful in treating his Hepatitis C infection. \n62.  Mr. Leyva has Hepatitis genotype 1 and recent lab results show that he has \nelevated or high levels of the Hepatitis C virus. \n63.  Mr. Leyva requested to be provided the latest direct-acting antiviral drug \ntreatment, but the doctor informed him that it cost too much. \n64.  Mr. Leyva filed a grievance requesting to be provided with the latest direct-acting \nantiviral drug treatment and fully exhausted his administrative remedies. \n65.

Mr. Leyva still has not received DAAD or proper medical treatment for his \nchronic Hepatitis C. \nPlaintiff David Maldonado \n69.  Plaintiff David Maldonado has been incarcerated in the DOC since 1980, and has \nbeen incarcerated at SCI Graterford since 1995. \n70.  Mr. Maldonado was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1997. \n71.  Mr. Maldonado was treated with interferon and ribavirin in 2001, but the \ntreatment was unsuccessful. \n72.  After undergoing a liver biopsy which revealed that Mr. Maldonado was between \nStage 1 and Stage 2 liver fibrosis, Mr. Maldonado was transferred to SCI Forest in June 2013 to \nreceive the triple therapy of interferon and ribavirin with boceprevir.  While there was some \ninitial success in reducing Mr.   viral load, the treatment failed after six months in \nDecember 2013. Mr. Maldonado returned to SCI Graterford in February 2014. \n73.  Mr. Maldonado requested the direct-acting antiviral drug treatment from the \nmedical staff and Medical Director Weiner, but was informed by the Bureau of Health Care \nServices that a new protocol was being developed. \n74.

Mr. Maldonado fibrosis requires immediate treatment to prevent any further \nliver damage or liver failure. \n78.  Mr. Maldonado filed grievances requesting to be provided proper medical \ntreatment for Hepatitis C, including the latest direct-acting antiviral drug treatment, and has fully \nexhausted his administrative remedies. \n79.  Mr. Leyva still has not received DAAD or proper medical treatment for his \nchronic Hepatitis C. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n80.  Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action on behalf of himself and all others \n \n81.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class on claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief: \nAll persons who are currently incarcerated in a Pennsylvania Department of \nCorrections facility with a diagnosed condition of Chronic Hepatitis C, and who \nhave at least twelve (12) weeks or more remaining to serve on their sentences, and \nwho have a life expectancy of over one year.  \n \n82.  As a result of D\nthe Class, members of the Class are or will be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and \ndeprived of their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief to remedy D  illegal and unconstitutional actions, policies, and \npractices. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 17 of 21\n83.  The requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) are satisfied by this class action. \n84.  The class includes no fewer than 5,400 inmates in the Pennsylvania DOC, who \nare geographically dispersed throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The number of \npersons who are members of the Class described above are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers in one action is impracticable. \n85.  Questions of law and fact that are common to the entire Class predominate over \nindividual questions because the actions of Defendants complained of herein were generally \napplicable to the entire class. These legal and factual questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  Whether the treatment regimens utilizing DAAD are the proper, necessary \nand standard course of treatment in the medical community; \nb.  Whether denial of treatment regimens utilizing DAAD drugs to the Class \nwill cause injury to the Class members, including unnecessary pain and \nsuffering, chronic illness, and death; and \nc.  Whether D  Hepatitis C current treatment policy, which denies \nnecessary DAAD treatment for many inmates with Chronic Hepatitis C \ninfections violates the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and \nArticle I § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n86.  Plaintiffs  claims are typical of the members of the Class because Plaintiffs and \nall Class Members were injured by the same wrongful policy and practices of Defendants as \ndescribed in this Complaint. Plaintiffs  claims arise from the same practices and course of \nconduct that give rise to the claims of the Class members, and are based on the same legal \ntheories. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-03333-JP   Document 50   Filed 02/03/17   Page 18 of 21\n87.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the Class they seek to represent. \nPlaintiffs are represented by competent and skilled counsel whose interests are fully aligned with \nthe interests of the Class. \n88.  Relief concerning Plaintiffs  rights under the laws herein alleged and with respect \nto the Class would be proper. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with regard to Class Members as a whole and certification of the Class under \nRule 23(b)(2) proper. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nDeprivation of Eighth Amendment Right to Medical Care \n \n89.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 88 of this Complaint as if fully set \nforth herein. \n90.  Defendants  acts and omissions in failing to provide adequate medical care \nconstitute a deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners infected with \nHepatitis C, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \nCOUNT II \nDeprivation of Right Not to Undergo Cruel and Unusual Punishment Under the \nPennsylvania Constitution \n \n91.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 88 of this Complaint as if fully set \nforth herein. \n92.
