    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit is part of an ongoing legal battle, across several cases, over allowing transgender individuals access to public facilities matching their gender identities. With eleven states joining together to challenge the DOJ, DOE, EEOC, and DOL over their interpretations of antidiscrimination statutes, it represents the broadest challenge to date of the Obama administration&rsquo;s position that transgender individuals should have access to bathrooms, changing rooms, and other public facilities and services that are in accordance with their gender identities.</p>\r\n<p>The eleven states filed this suit in response to the heightened debate over transgender rights that began after the North Carolina passed House Bill 2 (HB2), on March 23, 2016. The law prohibited municipalities from enacting antidiscrimination policies, curtailed private right of action to enforce antidiscrimination statutes in state courts, required that in restroom and changing facility access in government buildings be restricted based on biological sex, and formally changed the definition of sex in the state's antidiscrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,&rdquo; which prevents discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. The law sparked widespread condemnation from progressives, and a <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/15261/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> from the ACLU, in North Carolina. It also prompted the DOJ to send a letter to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory on May 4, 2016, informing him that they believe the law violates federal law and requesting that the governor not enforce it. After McCrory responded to their letter with a <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/15316/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> against the DOJ on May 9, the DOJ brought its own <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> against North Carolina in the Middle District of North Carolina, arguing that HB2 violated Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Violence Against Women Re-Authorization Act (VAWA).</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit that the DOJ brought against North Carolina threatens the state with a potential loss of millions of dollars in federal aid if the state is found to be non-compliant with the statutes cited. The eleven states that are plaintiffs in this case feared similar action by the DOJ against themselves, and so on May 25, 2016, they filed this lawsuit against the DOJ and against all other agency rules and guidance stating that antidiscrimination statutes require states to provide transgender individual access to public accommodations consonant with their gender identities. They filed their lawsuit in the Northern District Court of Texas, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2201 (Declaratory Judgement Act), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706 (Administrative Procedure Act), and 5 U.S.C. &sect; 611 (Regulatory Flexibility Act). Specifically, they asked the court to find that the agencies have violated federal law and the Constitution and to issue an injunction preventing the agencies rules, regulations, and guidance on the subject from having legal force.</p>\r\n<p>The judge issued an order granting the preliminary injunction on August 21, 2016. 201 F. Supp. 3d 810. The order found that the action was reviewable and plaintiffs had standing. The judge also held that the Department of Education was not entitled to deference because Title IX was not ambiguous and referred to biological sex. The district court further clarified the preliminary injunction on October 18, 2016, ruling that the injunction did apply nationwide. 2016 WL 7852331. The preliminary injunction and clarification were appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 21, 2016 (Docket No. 16-1534).</p>\r\n<p>The district court denied a stay on the injunction on November 20, 2016, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on appeal and suffered no irreparable harm. 2016 WL 7852330.</p>\r\n<p>After the change in presidential administrations, the DOJ and DOE issued new guidance that withdrew the previous guidance on transgender access to public facilities. That guidance can be found below. On March 2, 2017, the government filed an unopposed motion to withdraw the appeal, which was granted. The case was dismissed in the district court without prejudice on March 3, 2017.</p>",

Defendants’  rewriting  of  Title  VII  and  Title  IX  is  wholly \nincompatible with Congressional text. Absent action in Congress, the States, or local \ncommunities, Defendants cannot foist these radical changes on the nation. \nI.  PARTIES \n \n1.    Plaintiff  State  of  Texas  is  subject  to  Title  VII  as  the  employer  of \nhundreds of thousands through its constituent agencies. The State of Texas also \noversees and controls several agencies that receive federal funding subject to Title \nIX. For example, the School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (“SBVI”) and School \nfor the Deaf (“SD”) are statutorily created, independent state agencies. Tex. Educ. \nCode § 30.001 et seq. Both are governed by nine-member boards, appointed by the \ngovernor and confirmed by the senate, and both have superintendents appointed by \nthe boards and “carry out the functions and purposes of [each] school according to any \ngeneral  policy  the  board[s]  prescribe[].”  Id.  §§  30.023(e)  (SBVI);  30.053(e)  (SD). \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 3 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 4 of 32   PageID 4\n \nCurrently, SBVI has a total budget of $24,522,116, of which $4,789,974 is identified \nas federal funds, and SD has a total budget of $28,699,653, of which $1,957,075 is \nidentified  as  federal  funds.  As  another  example,  the  Texas  Juvenile  Justice \nDepartment (TJJD) is a state agency subject to Title VII and Title IX.

In this capacity, he is responsible for assuring safe and healthful working \nconditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by \nproviding training, outreach, education and assistance. He is sued in his official \ncapacity.   \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  17.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this suit concerns the ultra vires revision of the term “sex” under multiple \nprovisions of the United States Code. This Court also has jurisdiction to compel an \nofficer of the United States or any federal agency to perform his or her duty pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 6 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 7 of 32   PageID 7\n \n  18.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391 because the United States, several of its agencies, and several of its officers in \ntheir official capacity are Defendants; a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District; and Plaintiff Harrold ISD \n(TX) is both an employer subject to Title VII, and a recipient of federal monies subject \nto Title IX restrictions in Harrold, Texas. \n19.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory relief under \nthe  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”),  5  U.S.C.  § 706,  and  the  Declaratory \nJudgment Act (“DJA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. The Court is authorized to order \ncorrective action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), 5 U.S.C. § 611.  \nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n \nA. Congressional History. \n \n20.  In 1964, Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, making it \nillegal for employers to invidiously discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.  \n21.   Eight  years  later,  Congress  passed  Title  IX  of  the  Education \nAmendments of 1972, proscribing invidious discrimination on the basis of “sex” in \nfederally funded education programs and activities. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Title IX \npermits  institutions to  differentiate  intimate  facilities  by  sex.  20 U.S.C.  § 1686 \n(“Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  chapter,  nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving \nfunds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 7 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 8 of 32   PageID 8\n \nsexes.”). Section 1686 was added to address concerns that Title IX would force a \ncollege to allow women in dormitories designated for only men, and vice versa. When \nSenator Birch Bayh first introduced the legislation, Senator Dominick asked about \nthe scope of the law: \n Mr. DOMINICK. The provisions on page 1, under section 601, refer to \nthe fact that no one shall be denied the benefits of any program or \nactivity conducted, et cetera. The words “any program or activity,” in \nwhat way is the Senator thinking here? Is he thinking in terms of \ndormitory  facilities,  is  he  thinking  in  terms  of  athletic  facilities  or \nequipment, or in what terms are we dealing here? Or are we dealing with \njust educational requirements? \n  \nI think it is important, for example, because we have institutions of \nlearning which, because of circumstances such as I have pointed out, \nmay feel they do not have dormitory facilities which are adequate, or \nthey may feel, as some institutions are already saying, that you cannot \nsegregate  dormitories  anyway.  But  suppose  they  want  to  [sexually] \nsegregate the dormitories; can they do it? \n  \nMr. BAYH. The rulemaking powers referred to earlier, I think, give the \nSecretary discretion to take care of this particular policy problem. I do \nnot read this as requiring integration of dormitories between the sexes, \nnor do I feel it mandates the [sexual] desegregation of football fields. \n  \nWhat we are trying to do is provide equal access for women and men \nstudents to the educational process and the extracurricular activities in \na school, where there is not a unique facet such as football involved. We \nare not requiring that intercollegiate football be desegregated, nor that \nthe men’s locker room be [sexually] desegregated. \n  \n117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971) (emphasis added). \n22.  The following year, when Title IX was passed, Senator Bayh again \nreiterated that this was not meant to force men and women to share intimate facilities \nwhere their privacy rights would be compromised: \nUnder this amendment, each Federal agency which extends Federal \nfinancial  assistance  is  empowered  to  issue  implementing  rules  and \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 8 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 9 of 32   PageID 9\n \nregulations effective after approval of the President. These regulations \nwould allow enforcing agencies to permit differential treatment by sex \nonly—very unusual cases where such treatment is absolutely necessary \nto the success of the program—such as in classes for pregnant girls or \nemotionally disturbed students, in sports facilities or other instances \nwhere personal privacy must be preserved. \n  \n118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972) (emphasis added). \n23.  The same concerns were raised when Title IX was debated in the House. \nRepresentative  Thompson,  concerned  about  men  and  women  using  the  same \nfacilities, offered an amendment: \nI have been disturbed however, about the statements that if there is to be \nno discrimination based on sex then there can be no separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes. I have talked with the gentlewoman from \nOregon  (Mrs.  Green)  and  discussed  with  the  gentlewoman  an \namendment which she says she would accept. The amendment simply \nwould state that nothing contained herein shall preclude any educational \ninstitution from maintaining separate living facilities because of sex. So, \nwith  that  understanding  I  feel  that  the  amendment  [exempting \nundergraduate programs from Title IX] now under consideration should \nbe opposed and I will offer the “living quarters” amendment at the \nproper time. \n  \n117 Cong. Rec. 39260 (1971) (emphasis added). This amendment was eventually \nintroduced and passed. 117 Cong. Rec. 39263 (1971). \n  B. Aftermath of Title IX.  \n  24.  Following the enactment of Title IX, there was broad support behind the \npolicy of maintaining separate intimate facilities for female and male students. The \ninitial  rules  that  the  federal  government  promulgated  to  implement  Title  IX \npermitted schools receiving federal funds to separate restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex. 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. Furthermore, legal scholars \ndefended separate sex intimate facilities as necessary to preserve individual privacy \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 9 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 10 of 32   PageID 10\n \nrights. In a 1975 Washington Post editorial, then Columbia Law School Professor \nRuth Bader Ginsburg wrote that “[s]eparate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal \nbodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual \nprivacy.” Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights Amendment, WASH. POST, Apr. 7, \n1975, at A21. And in a 1977 report, the United States Commission on Civil Rights \nconcluded  the  “the  personal  privacy  principle  permits  maintenance  of  separate \nsleeping and bathroom facilities” for women and men. United States Commission on \nCivil Rights, SEX BIAS IN THE U.S. CODE 216 (1977).  \n25.  Meanwhile,  Congress  repeatedly  construed  its  prohibitions  against \ninvidious “sex” discrimination narrowly. In 1974, Representatives Bella Abzug and \nEdward Koch proposed to amend the Civil Rights Act to add the category of “sexual \norientation.” H.R. 14752, 93rd Cong. (1974). Congress considered other similar bills \nduring the 1970s. See H.R. 166, 94th Cong. (1975); H.R. 2074, 96th Cong. (1979); S. \n2081,  96th  Cong.  (1979).  In  1994,  lawmakers  introduced  the  Employment  Non-\nDiscrimination  Act  (“ENDA”),  which,  like  Abzug  and  Koch’s  earlier  effort,  was \npremised on the understanding that Title VII’s protections against invidious “sex” \ndiscrimination related only to one’s biological sex as male or female. H.R. 4636, 103rd \nCong. (1994). In 2007, 2009, and 2011, lawmakers proposed a broader version of \nEDNA to codify the definition of “sex” that Defendants now embrace. H.R. 3685, \n110th Cong. (2007); H.R. 2981, 111th Cong. (2009); S. 811, 112th Cong. (2011). In \naddition, in 2013 and 2015, proposals were made to add to Title IX the category of \n“gender  identity.”  H.R.  1652,  113th  Cong.  (2013);  S.439,  114th  Cong.  (2015). \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 10 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 11 of 32   PageID 11\n \nNotwithstanding  the  success  or  failure  of  the  aforementioned  Congressional \nproposals, they all affirmed Congress’s enduring understanding that “sex,” as a \nprotected class, refers only to one’s biological sex, as male or female, and not the \nradical re-authoring of the term now being foisted upon Americans by the collective \nefforts of Defendants.  \n26.  Moreover,  Congress  did  overtly  choose  to  extended  protections  for \n“gender identity” in other areas of federal law. In 2010, President Obama signed into \nlaw hate crimes legislation, 18 U.S.C. § 249, which applies to, inter alia, “gender \nidentity.” 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2). And in 2013, President Obama signed the Violence \nagainst Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA), prohibiting recipients of certain federal \ngrants from discriminating on the basis of “sex” and “gender identity.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 13925(b)(13)(A).   \n27.  According to influential legal treatises, “gender identity” is not within \nthe ambit of Title VII. See, e.g., 1 Barbara Lindemann & Paul Grossman, Employment \nDiscrimination Law 551—52 (4th ed. 2007); 1 Barbara Lindemann & Paul Grossman, \nEmployment Discrimination Law 475—76 (3d ed. 1996).  \n28.  Yet  the  Obama  Administration  began  to  rewrite  statutes  to  cover \n“gender identity” as though they had actually been amended. For example:  \n  In  a  2010  Dear  Colleague  Letter,  the  DOE’s  Office  of  Civil  Rights \n(“OCR”) asserted that “Title IX does protect all students, including . . . \ntransgender  (LGBT)  students,  from  sex  discrimination.”  OCR,  Dear \nColleague Letter: Harassment and Bullying 8 (Oct. 26, 2010) (Exhibit A).  \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 11 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 12 of 32   PageID 12\n \n  In  2014,  OCR stated  that  “Title  IX’s sex  discrimination prohibition \nextends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure \nto conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity.” OCR, \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence B-2 (Apr. 29, \n2014) (Exhibit B).  \n  Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo in 2014 concluding that \nTitle  VII’s  prohibition  of  sexual  discrimination  “encompasses \ndiscrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status.” \nDOJ,  Memorandum  from  the  Attorney  General,  Treatment  of \nTransgender Employment Discrimination Claims Under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 2 (Dec. 15, 2014) (Exhibit C).  \n  And in 2015, OSHA announced that it had published “guidance” for \nemployers regarding restroom access for individuals who identify with \nthe sex opposite their own. Press Release, OSHA, OSHA publishes guide \nto restroom access for transgender workers (June 1, 2015), available at \nhttps://www.osha.gov/newsrelease/trade-20150601.html.  OSHA’s  so-called \nguidance concluded that “all employees should be permitted to use the \nfacilities that correspond with their gender identity,” which is “internal” \nand could be “different from the sex they were assigned at birth.” OSHA, \nA guide to Restroom Access for Transgender Workers (2015) (Exhibit D)  \nFinally, in 2016, the Obama Administration’s disregard for federal law as written—\nand the ability to maintain separate sex intimate facilities—reached its nadir in the \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 12 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 13 of 32   PageID 13\n \nwake of events in North Carolina.  \nC. North Carolina. \n \n  29.   On February 22, 2016, the City Council of Charlotte, North Carolina, \namended the city’s Non-Discrimination Ordinance (Exhibit E), requiring that every \ngovernment and business bathroom and shower be simultaneously open to both \nsexes. In other words, Charlotte outlawed the right to maintain separate sex intimate \nfacilities throughout the city. The North Carolina General Assembly then passed the \nPublic Facilities Privacy and Security Act (“the Act”) (Exhibit F), preempting the \nCharlotte ordinance and providing that public employees and public school students \nuse bathrooms and showers correlating with their biological sex, defined as the sex \nnoted  on  their  birth  certificate.  The  Act  does  not  establish  a  policy  for  private \nbusinesses and permits accommodations based on special circumstances.  \n30.   After signing the Act, North Carolina Governor Patrick L. McCrory \nissued Executive Order 93 to Protect Privacy and Equality (“EO 93”) (Exhibit G). EO \n93  expanded  non-discrimination  protections  to  state  employees  on  the  basis  of \n“gender  identity,”  while  simultaneously  affirming  that  cabinet  agencies  should \nrequire multiple occupancy intimate facilities, like bathrooms, to be designated for \nuse only by persons based on their biological sex. EO 93 directed agencies to make \nreasonable accommodations when practicable. \n31.  Nevertheless, on May 3, 2016, the EEOC released a document titled \n“Fact Sheet: Bathroom Access Rights for Transgender Employees Under Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964” (“Fact Sheet”) (Exhibit H). The Fact Sheet states that \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 13 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 14 of 32   PageID 14\n \nTitle VII’s prohibition of invidious discrimination on the basis of “sex” also now \nextends to “gender identity.” It further provides that employers that do not allow \nemployees to use the bathroom and other intimate facilities of their choosing are \nliable for unlawful discrimination on the basis of “sex.” \n32.  Then, on May 4, 2016, DOJ sent Governor McCrory a letter (Exhibit I), \ndeclaring that the Act and EO 93 violate both Title VII and Title IX. DOJ threatened \nto “apply to [an] appropriate court for an order that will ensure compliance with” its \nultra vires rewriting of the law.  \n33.  On May 9, 2016, DOJ sued North Carolina, asserting that both the Act \nand EO 93 are impermissible under federal law. \nD. The DOJ / DOE Dear Colleague Letter. \n  34.   On May 13, 2016, DOJ and DOE issued a joint “Dear Colleague Letter” \n(“the Letter”) (Exhibit J), officially foisting its new version of federal law on the more \nthan 100,000 elementary and secondary schools that receive federal funding.  \n35.   The  Letter  contends  that  Title  IX’s  prohibition  of  invidious  “sex” \ndiscrimination also somehow encompasses discrimination based on “gender identity.” \nFurther, it advises that schools taking a different view of Title IX face legal action \nand the loss of federal funds. The Letter concerns “Title IX obligations regarding \ntransgender students” and provides insight as to the manner in which DOE and DOJ \nwill evaluate how schools “are complying with their legal obligations” (emphasis \nadded). It  refers to  an accompanying  document  collecting  examples from  school \npolicies  and  recommends  that  school  officials  comb  through  the  document  “for \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 14 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 15 of 32   PageID 15\n \npractical ways to meet Title IX’s requirements” (same). Indeed, the Letter amounts to \n“significant guidance” (emphasis in original). \n36.   According to the Letter, schools must treat a student’s “gender identity” \nas the student’s “sex” for purposes of Title IX compliance, with one notable exception. \n“Gender identity,” the Letter explains, refers to a person’s “internal sense of gender,” \nwithout regard for biological sex. It can be the same as a person’s biological sex, or \ndifferent. The Letter provides that no medical diagnosis or treatment requirement is \na prerequisite to selecting one’s “gender identity,” nor is there any form of temporal \nrequirement. In other words, a student can choose one “gender identity” on one \nparticular day or hour, and then another one the next. And students of any age may \nestablish a “gender identity” different from their biological sex simply by notifying \nthe school administration—the involvement of a parent or guardian is not necessary. \n37.  In the case of athletics, however, the Letter does not require schools to \ntreat a student’s “gender identity” as the student’s sex for the purpose of Title IX \ncompliance.  Instead, the Letter basically leaves intact Title IX regulations allowing \nschools to restrict athletic teams to members of one biological sex. The only change \nthat the Letter makes to athletic programs is that schools may not “rely on overly \nbroad  generalizations  or  stereotypes”  about  students.  Otherwise,  differentiating \nsports teams on the basis of sex—not “gender identity”—is consistent with the Letter. \nThe Letter’s disparate treatment of bathrooms and showers, on the one hand, and \nathletics, on the other, demonstrates that DOE/DOJ is not simply demanding that \nschools abide by Title IX (as reinterpreted to substitute “gender identity” for “sex”). \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 15 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 16 of 32   PageID 16\n \nRather, the Letter tries to rewrite Title IX by executive fiat, mandating all bathrooms \nand  showers  open  to  both  sexes,  while  simultaneously  permitting  different  sex \nathletics subject to limited exceptions. The new policy has no basis in law.   \n38.  Adapting to the new circumstances put forth by DOE and DOJ requires \nseismic changes in the operations of the nation’s school districts. Schools subject to \nTitle  IX  must  allow  students  to  choose  the  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  other \nintimate facilities that match their chosen “gender identity” on any given day. Single-\nsex classes, schools, and dormitories must also be open to students based on their \nchosen “gender identity.”  \n39.  On May 16, 2016, the Attorneys General of Oklahoma, Texas, and West \nVirginia sent DOJ and DOE a letter (Exhibit K) requesting clarification on the effect \nof the letter on agencies within these States. DOJ and DOE did not respond.   \nE. Harrold Independent School District (TX). \n \n40.       On May 23, 2016, school board members of the Harrold ISD (“the \nBoard”) convened a regular session. At the session, the Board adopted a policy (“the \nPolicy”) (Exhibit L) consistent with its current practice. The Policy, which applies to \nstudents and employees of the Harrold ISD, limits multiple occupancy bathrooms and \nlocker rooms to usage by persons based on their biological sex. The Policy also allows \nfor accommodations. \n41.       After adopting the Policy, the Board requested representation (Exhibit \nM) from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) of Texas, under Texas Education \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 16 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 17 of 32   PageID 17\n \nCode § 11.151(e), to determine whether the Policy is in conflict with federal law and, \nif so, whether the Policy is enforceable. The OAG agreed to represent the Board.    \n42.   Harrold ISD is subject to Title VII and receives federal funding subject \nto Title IX. In 2015–16, Harrold ISD operated on a total annual budget exceeding $1.4 \nmillion, with the federal portion amounting to approximately $117,000.  \n43.       The Defendants’ “significant guidance” Letter of May 13, 2016, (Exhibit \nJ) reiterates that Title IX and its implementing regulations apply to “educational \nprograms and activities operated by recipients of Federal financial assistance” and \nthat schools agree to same “as a condition of receiving federal assistance.”  \n44.       Thus, the federal government would be legally entitled to deny federal \nfunds that comprise a substantial portion of Harrold ISD’s budget if Harrold ISD \nchooses to  follow its  Policy instead  of the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations of Defendants. \nF. Arizona Plaintiffs.   \n45.   Plaintiffs  Arizona  Department  of  Education,  by  and  through \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas, and Heber-Overgaard Unified \nSchool District (collectively, the “Arizona Plaintiffs”) have requested that Arizona \nAttorney General Mark Brnovich represent them in the present litigation.  Arizona \nAttorney  General  Mark  Brnovich  deems  it  necessary  to  represent  the  Arizona \nPlaintiffs. Arizona Department of Education Guideline and Procedure Doc. No. HR-\n20 (Exhibit N), which applies to all Arizona Plaintiffs, provides that “It is not . . . \ndiscriminatory  for  a  school  to  offer  separate  housing,  toilet,  athletic  and  other \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 17 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 18 of 32   PageID 18\n \nfacilities  on  the  basis  of  sex,  so  long  as  the  facilities  provided  to  each  sex  are \ncomparable.” \nG. Federal Education Funding.  \n46.  The threatened loss of all federal funding for state and local education \nprograms would have a major effect on State education budgets. All fifty States \nreceives  a  share  of  the  $69,867,660,640  in  annual  funding  that  the  Federal \nGovernment directs to state and local education.  DOE, Funds for State Formula-\nAllocated and Selected Student Aid Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Funding at 120  \navailable  at  http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/statetables/index.html \n(charts listing the amount of federal education funding by program nationally and by \nstate). DOE estimates that the federal government will spend over $36 billion in State \nand local elementary and secondary education, and over $30 billion in State and local \npostsecondary education programs in 2016.  \n47.   Not counting funds paid directly to state education agencies, or funds \npaid for non-elementary and secondary programs, the national amount of direct \nfederal  funding  to  public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  alone  exceeds \n$55,862,552,000 on average annually—which amounts to 9.3 percent of the average \nState’s total revenue for public elementary and secondary schools, or $1,128 per pupil.  \nTexas’s public elementary and secondary schools, for example, receive an average of \n$5,872,123,000 annually, or $1,156 per pupil, which amounts to about 11.7 percent of \nthe State’s revenue for public elementary and secondary schools.  \n48.

The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein also violate separation of powers principles by purporting to expand federal \ncourt jurisdiction to cover whether persons of both sexes have a right to use previously \nseparate sex intimate facilities, an issue on which Congress has not intended to \nlegislate.

New York v. \nUnited States, 505 U.S. 144, 162 (1992) (“While Congress has substantial powers to \ngovern the Nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the States, the \nConstitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require \nthe States to govern according to Congress’ instructions.”). \n  66.  The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein unlawfully attempt to preempt State law regarding rights of privacy because \nhistoric powers reserved to the States, such as civil privacy protections, cannot be \nsuperseded  by  federal  act,  “unless  that  was  the  clear  and  manifest  purpose  of \nCongress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947); see also Wyeth \nv. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460–70 (1991). \nAs explained herein, not only is there no evidence that Congress intended to regulate \ncivil privacy circumstances within the States, but legislative history demonstrates \nthat Congress expressed its clear intent to not encroach upon the traditional State \nrole in safeguarding privacy expectations in the workplace, public accommodations, \nand educational settings. \n67.  Because the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations are \nnot in accordance with the law as articulated above, they are unlawful, violate 5 \nU.S.C. § 706, and should be set aside. \n \n \n \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 23 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 24 of 32   PageID 24\n \nCOUNT FOUR \nRelief Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that the new Rules, Regulations, \nGuidance, and Interpretations at Issue Are Unlawful by Violating the \nFourteenth Amendment \n \n68.   The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 67 are reincorporated herein. \n  69.  The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action \nfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n70.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees “equal protection of the laws.” \nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. The new rules, regulations, and interpretations violate \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment  because  they  treat  similarly  situated  students  and \nemployees different. \n71.   The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein violate the Fourteenth Amendment because they treat similarly situated \nstudents  and  employees  differently.  The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations described herein provide access to all restrooms and showers for \nindividuals who self-identify as the opposite sex. But if the right or ability to use the \nintimate facilities of one’s choosing extends only to those who self-identify as the \nopposite sex then the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations treat \nunequally students and employees that require access to intimate areas. \n  72.  Due  to  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations \ndescribed herein, Defendants are selectively enforcing new principles differently as \nto similarly situated students and employees, which violates the principle of equal \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 24 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 25 of 32   PageID 25\n \nprotection contained within the Fourteenth Amendment \n73.  Because the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations are \nnot in accordance with the law articulated above, they are unlawful, violate 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706, and should be set aside. \nCOUNT FIVE \nRelief Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that the \nnew Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations at Issue Unlawfully \nAttempt to Abrogate State Sovereign Immunity. \n \n74.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 73 are reincorporated herein. \n75.  The new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations improperly \nabrogate the States’ sovereign immunity without supporting Congressional findings. \n76.  The Supreme Court has acknowledged Congress’s abrogation of the \nStates’ sovereign immunity in the employment context, but only on the basis of \nCongressional findings and concerns about State workplace discrimination regarding \nunequal treatment between men and women, and not an employee’s decision on \nwhether they choose to define themselves as a man or woman. See, e.g., Nev. Dep’t of \nHuman Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 728 and n.2 (2003) (observing that the FMLA \naims to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men). \n77.  In adopting their new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations, \nthe Defendants point to no Congressional findings about invidious discrimination by \nthe States (or any other employer) based on “gender identity.” Indeed, the Defendants \ndid  not  even  consider  whether  Congress  intended  the  term  “sex”  to  include  an \nindividual’s right to choose their sex, or properly refers to “sex” as an immutable, \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 25 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 26 of 32   PageID 26\n \nbiological fact established at one’s birth. The Defendants cannot expand abrogation \nof the State’s sovereign immunity by rewriting the  definition of “sex” as it was \noriginally adopted by Congress. \nCOUNT SIX \nRelief Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that new Rules, Regulations, Guidance \nand Interpretations at Issue Are Arbitrary and Capricious \n \n78.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 77 are reincorporated herein. \n79.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n80.  Defendants’  actions—rewriting  federal  law  to  suit  their  own  policy \npreferences—are arbitrary and capricious and not otherwise in accordance with the \nlaw. Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious because they interfere with \nlocal schools by unilaterally redefining the statutory term “sex”—long and widely \naccepted to be a biological category—to include “gender identity.” Title IX and Title \nVII do not refer to “gender identity.” Nor does 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which expressly \nauthorizes separate restrooms and locker rooms “on the basis of sex.” The federal \nlaws at issue prohibit disparate treatment “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33, a term long understood unambiguously to be a biological category \nbased principally on male or female reproductive anatomy, and not one that includes \nself-proclaimed “gender identity.” \n \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 26 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 27 of 32   PageID 27\n \nCOUNT SEVEN \nRelief Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that new Rules, Regulations, Guidance \nand Interpretations at Issue Are Arbitrary and Capricious \n \n81.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 80 are reincorporated herein. \n82.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n83.  Under PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act), 42 U.S.C. § 15601 et seq., \nthose that identify as the sex opposite their biological sex have the option to shower \nseparately. 28 C.F.R. § 115.42(f). Coupling this element in PREA with the new rules, \nregulations, guidance and interpretations at issue (where everyone may identify as \nthe opposite sex, if they choose to do so) means that every inmate has the right to take \na  separate  shower,  which  is  an  untenable  position  (and,  thus,  arbitrary  and \ncapricious), especially within a correctional circumstance. \nCOUNT EIGHT \nRelief Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that the \nnew Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations at Issue Are \nUnlawful and Violate Constitutional Standards of Clear Notice \n \n84.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 83 are reincorporated herein. \n85.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n86.  When  Congress  exercises  its  Spending  Clause  power,  principles  of \nfederalism require that conditions on Congressional funds must enable the recipient \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 27 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 28 of 32   PageID 28\n \n“clearly understand,” from the language of the law itself, the conditions to which they \nare agreeing to when accepting the federal funds. Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ. \nv. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006). Further, the ex-post interpretation in the new \nrules is not in accord with the interpretation that existed when the States opted into \nthe spending program. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985) (providing \nthat a state’s obligation under cooperative federalism program ‘‘generally should be \ndetermined by reference to the law in effect when the grants were made’’).   \n87.  The text employed by Congress does not support the term “sex” as \nanything other than one’s immutable, biological sex as determined at birth. Rather, \nCongress expressed its intent to cover “gender identity,” as a protected class, in other \npieces of legislation. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2)(A); 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A). In \nthose pieces of legislation, Congress includes “gender identity” along with “sex,” thus \nevidencing  its  intent  for  “sex”  to  retain  its  original  and  only  meaning—one’s \nimmutable, biological sex as determined at birth. \nCOUNT NINE \nDeclaratory Judgment Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (APA) that the new Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations \nat Issue Are Unlawful and Unconstitutionally Coercive \n \n88.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 87 are reincorporated herein. \n89.  By placing in jeopardy a substantial percentage of Plaintiffs’ budgets if \nthey refuse to comply with the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations \nof Defendants, Defendants have left Plaintiffs no real choice but to acquiesce in such \npolicy. See NFIB v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2605 (2012) (“The threatened loss of \nPlaintiffs’ Original Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 28 \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1   Filed 05/25/16    Page 29 of 32   PageID 29\n \nover 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that \nleaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce . . . .”). \n90.  “The legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power ‘thus rests \non  whether  the  [entity]  voluntarily  and  knowingly  accepts  the  terms  of  the \n‘contract.’” NFIB,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2602  (quoting  Pennhurst  State  Sch.  &  Hosp.  v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). “Congress may use its spending power to create \nincentives for [entities] to act in accordance with federal policies. But when ‘pressure \nturns  into  compulsion,’  the  legislation  runs  contrary  to  our  system  of \nfederalism.” Id. (quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)). \n“That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly \ncoerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.” Id. \n91.  “[T]he financial ‘inducement’ [Defendants have] chosen is much more \nthan ‘relatively mild encouragement’ – it is a gun to the head.” Id. at 2604. When \nconditions  on the  receipt  of funds “take  the  form  of threats  to  terminate  other \nsignificant independent grants, the conditions are properly viewed as a means of \npressuring the states to accept policy changes.” Id.; cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n203, 211 (1987). \n92.  Furthermore,  the  Spending  Clause  requires  that  the  entities \n“voluntarily and knowingly accept[]” the conditions for the receipt of federal funds. \nNFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2602 (quoting Halderman, 451 U.S. at 17). \n93.

The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 93 are reincorporated herein. \n95.  Before  issuing  any  of  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations at issue, Defendants failed to prepare and make available for public \ncomment an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis as required by the RFA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 603(a). An agency can avoid performing a flexibility analysis if the agency’s \ntop official certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities. Id. § 605(b). The certification must include a \nstatement providing the factual basis for the agency’s determination that the rule \nwill not significantly impact small entities. Id.  \n96.  None of the Defendants even attempted such a certification. Thus, the \nCourt  should  declare  Defendants’  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations unlawful and set them aside.  \n \nV.

As part of its bid or proposal, the bidder or proposer shall provide to the city a list of \nall  instances within the past  ten  years where  a  complaint  was filed or pending \nagainst  bidder  or  proposer  in  a  legal  or  administrative  proceeding alleging that \nbidder or proposer discriminated against its subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, or \ncommercial  customers,  and  a  description  of  the  status  or  resolution  of  that \ncomplaint, including any remedial action taken. \n \n6.  As a condition of submitting a bid or proposal to the city the bidder or proposer \nagrees to comply with the city's commercial non-discrimination policy as described \nin section 2, article V of the city code, and consents to be bound by the award of \nany arbitration conducted thereunder.” \n \nSection 2.

SCOTT PRUITT  PATRICK MORRISEY \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF \nOKLAHOMA  WEST VIRGINIA\nMay 17, 2016 \nCatherine E. Lhamon \nAssistant Secretary for Civil Rights \nU.S. Department of Education \n400 Maryland Avenue, SW  \nWashington, D.C. 20202 \nVanita Gupta, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \nU.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General, Main  \nWashington, D.C. 20530-0001 \nRe: Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students \nDear Assistant Secretary Lhamon and Assistant Attorney General Gupta, \nOn May 13, 2016, you sent a “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students” to recipients of \nfederal funding subject to Title IX’s requirements. We have reviewed the letter. As chief law officers \nof our respective states, it is imperative that we be able to advise our state agencies with a proper \nunderstanding of the effect you intend this letter to have. We thus write to you seeking clarification \non several points.  \nFirst, you describe the letter as “significant guidance.” We understand this designation to mean that \nyou reasonably anticipate that your letter will:  \n(i) Lead to an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely \naffect  in  a  material  way  the  economy,  a  sector  of  the  economy,  productivity, \ncompetition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \nEXHIBIT K\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1-12   Filed 05/25/16    Page 2 of 4   PageID 132\ngovernments or communities; or (ii) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise \ninterfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; or (iii) Materially alter \nthe budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the \nrights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (iv) Raise novel legal or policy issues \narising out of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 12866, as further amended.1  \n \nThat definition of “significant guidance,” taken together with your statement that the purpose of the \nletter is to “inform recipients about how the Departments evaluate whether covered entities are \ncomplying with their legal obligations,” leads us and others to understand that your Departments \nwill consider any entity not adhering to this “significant guidance” as out of compliance with Title \nIX, and thus subject to loss of federal funding. In order to clarify this understanding, please answer \nthe following questions: In your view, must an entity receiving federal funding follow this \n“significant  guidance”  in  order  to  be  in  compliance  with  Title  IX  and/or  entitled  to \ncontinued receipt of federal funding? Do circumstances exist in which you would consider a \nschool still in compliance with Title IX despite non compliance with these guidelines? If so, \nplease describe those circumstances and whether you would take steps to recoup or end \nfederal funding. \n \nSecond, in the “Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices,” the Office of Management and \nBudget stated that “given their legally nonbinding nature, significant guidance documents should not \ninclude mandatory language such as ‘‘shall,’’ ‘‘must,’’ ‘‘required’’ or ‘‘requirement[.]”2 By our count, \nyour letter uses the word “must” 15 times, and the words “required” and “requirement” 10 times. \nBecause of the mandatory language used in your letter, it is our understanding that you intend the \nletter to bind recipients of federal funding to compliance. In order to clarify this understanding, \nplease  answer  the  following  question:  Must  recipients  of  federal  funding  satisfy  the \nrequirements described in the letter, including the requirement that recipients of federal \nfunding “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and \nits implementing regulations”?  \n \nThird, you state that your letter “does not add requirements to applicable law.” However, we are \naware of no provision of Title IX, nor any decision of any court that would be binding in our states,3 \nthat mandates that schools “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of \nTitle IX and its implementing regulations.” In other words, if your letter imposes on its recipients \nthe obligation to “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and \nits implementing regulations,” then we are at a loss as to how your letter does not in fact “add \nrequirements to applicable law.” In order to clarify any confusion, please answer the following \nquestion: What existing statute, regulation, or binding court decision mandates that schools \nreceiving federal funding must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for \npurposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations”? \n                                                \n1 Office of Management and Budget, Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices, 72 Fed. Reg. 3432 \n(Jan. 25, 2007), www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/2007/012507_good_guidance.pdf.  \n2 Id.  \n3 The recent decision by two judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in G.G. v. Gloucester \nCounty School Board did not address the legality of a federal edict as sweeping as the letter. Moreover, that \ndecision is still subject to challenge; indeed, nine States filed a brief last week supporting further review by all \nfifteen judges on that court. \n2 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 1-12   Filed 05/25/16    Page 3 of 4   PageID 133\n \nFourth, your letter defines “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of gender” (emphasis \nadded). Your letter also explains that “[t]he Departments interpret Title IX to require that when a \nstudent or the student’s parent or guardian, as appropriate, notifies the school administration that \nthe student will assert a gender identity that differs from previous representations or records, the \nschool will begin treating the student consistent with the student’s gender identity.” We understand \nthis to mean that in your view, schools are bound by each student’s subjective statement of their \n“gender identity” with respect to defining that student’s “sex.” And once a student notifies the \nschool that their “internal sense of gender” has changed, the school must immediately change the \nway it administers its programs with respect to that student. As your letter indicates, this would \nrequire the school to immediately require all staff to refer to the student as “he” instead of “she” (or \nvice versa), and to allow the student to use the bathroom and locker room for the sex opposite of \nthat which they previously “identified,” and even to let the student play sports for a team of the sex \nopposite of that which they previously “identified” (unless, apparently, there is “sound, current, and \nresearch-based  medical  knowledge  about  the  impact  of  the  students’  participation  on  the \ncompetitive fairness or physical safety of the sport.”). In order to clarify any confusion, please \nanswer the following question: Is it now a requirement of Title IX that schools administer their \nprograms according to each student’s subjective “internal sense of gender,” and that Title \nIX bars schools from requiring any sort of objective verification of a student’s sex? \n \nFifth, most schools understandably require that boys use the boy’s restroom/locker room and that \ngirls use the girl’s restroom/locker room. Your letter states that once a student’s “internal sense of \ngender” changes, that student must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing. It would be \nan odd result if this requirement meant that a transgender student could use either the boy’s or the \ngirl’s restroom/locker room, whereas other students would remain bound to use one or the other. \nIndeed, it would conflict with your statement that “a school must not treat a transgender student \ndifferently  from  the  way  it  treats  other  students  of  the  same  gender  identity,”  since  non-\ntransgendered students would have less access to fewer restrooms/locker rooms than transgendered \nstudents. We assume, therefore, that a school could require the student to use only the bathroom for \nthe gender with which the student at that moment in time identify. In order to clarify any confusion, \nplease  answer  the  following  question:  May  a  school  require  that  a  student  use only  the \nbathroom/locker room for the gender with which that student identifies?  \n \nWe seek responses to these important clarifying questions by no later than close of business on May \n24, 2016. \n                 \nSincerely, \n \nE.

In the present \nmotion, Defendants ask the Court to reconsider the nationwide scope of its injunction by requesting \na partial stay, pending appeal, of the injunction’s application to non-plaintiff states and entities.  \nDefs.’ Mot. 7, ECF No. 95.  Defendants reassert several arguments the Court previously addressed \nat length and the Court will not repeat its analysis on those issues. \nII.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  Defendants are Unlikely to Succeed on Appeal and Suffer No Irreparable Injury  \n  A party seeking stay of an injunction bears the burden of demonstrating (1) likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) likelihood the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) that \nissuance of a stay will not substantially injure the other parties; and (4) that the stay is in the public \ninterest.  See Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 746–47 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009)).  The first two factors “are the most critical.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n  “A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result,” and the \npropriety  of  issuing  a  stay  depends  on  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case.    Planned \nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 427).  The decision to grant or deny a stay is committed to the trial \ncourt’s sound discretion.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 433. \n  The Court remains convinced that Plaintiffs, not Defendants, have shown a great likelihood \nof success on the merits of their claims; and incorporates herein the analysis developed in its \nAugust 21, 2016 Order issuing the preliminary injunction.  Aug. 21, 2016 Order 2, ECF No. 58 \n(finding “Defendants failed to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act by: (1) foregoing \n2 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 100   Filed 11/20/16    Page 3 of 6   PageID 1794\nthe Administrative Procedures Act’s notice and comment requirements; and (2) issuing directives \nwhich contradict the existing legislative and regulatory texts.”).   \n  Additionally, Defendants fail to show they will suffer irreparable injury absent a stay.  The \nfirst part of the enjoined Guidelines1 was issued in 2010 and the most recent component on May \n13,  2016,  just  days  after  the  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”)  seemingly  began  nationwide \nenforcement, suing North Carolina for upholding the right to sex-designated intimate facilities.2  \nAug. 21, 2016 Order 3, ECF No. 58.  The federal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis \nof “sex”—the scope and meaning of which Defendants claim now includes gender identity—were \npromulgated more than forty years ago.3  See id.  The federal government did not articulate, much \nless enforce, the Guidelines’ interpretation of sex as including gender identity for nearly fifty years \nafter Title VII was passed in 1964 and the Court views this delay as strong evidence that \nDefendants will suffer no irreparable injury if a stay is denied and enforcement of the Guidelines \ndelayed until their legality is established.   \n  In requesting the Court remove non-plaintiff states from the injunction’s reach, Defendants \nclaim that “[non-plaintiff states] are in a better position than Plaintiffs or this Court to assess their \nown interests and injuries.”  Defs.’ Mot. 16, ECF No. 95.  But the injunction only restricts \nDefendants from enforcing or relying on the Guidelines; and leaves non-plaintiff states free to \n                                                           \n1 The Guidelines refer to the documents attached to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint: (1) Ex. A (DOE \nBullying Memo 2010), ECF No. 6-1; (2) Ex. B (DOE Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence Memo) (“DOE Q&A Memo), ECF No. 6-2; (3) Ex. C (“Holder Memo 2014”), ECF No. 6-3, (4) \nEx. D (OSHA Best Practice Guide), ECF No. 6-4; (5) Ex. H (EEOC Fact Sheet), ECF No. 6-8; and (6) Ex. \nJ (DOJ/DOE Dear Colleague Letter), ECF No. 6-10. \n2 United States v. North Carolina, No. 1:16-cv-425 (M.D.N.C.) (filed May 9, 2016). \n3 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(“Title VII”). \n3 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 100   Filed 11/20/16    Page 4 of 6   PageID 1795\nexercise their judgment in crafting and enforcing legislation with respect to intimate facilities.4  \nDefendants also claim the injunction burdens non-plaintiff states by “denying them the benefit of \nfederal antidiscrimination enforcement.”  Defs.’ Mot. 16, ECF No. 95.  But non-plaintiff states \ncontinue to enjoy the benefit of all federal antidiscrimination enforcement that falls outside the \ninjunction—combatting “discrimination based on race, national origin, or disability.” Aug. 21, \n2016 Order 5, ECF No. 86.  Further, the injunction “does not affect a school’s obligation to \ninvestigate and remedy student complaints of sexual harassment, sex stereotyping, and bullying.”  \nOct. 18, 2016 Order 5, ECF No. 86.  Defendants grossly misstate the injunction’s scope in claiming \nit prohibits states from receiving “federal enforcement of the civil rights laws.”  Defs.’ Mot. 16, \nECF No. 95.  The Court emphasized in its clarification order and reiterates here that the injunction \ndoes not prevent Defendants from continuing their core mission of enforcing the federal civil rights \nlaws enacted by Congress.     \nB.  Breadth of Injunction \n  As previously emphasized, this Court possesses the power to issue a nationwide injunction \nand finds such relief appropriate in the present case.  “[T]he Constitution vests the District Court \nwith ‘the judicial power of the United States.’  That power is not limited to the district wherein the \ncourt sits but extends across the country.  It is not beyond the power of a court, in appropriate \ncircumstances, to issue a nationwide injunction.”  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 (5th \nCir. 2015) (quoting U.S. Const. art. III, §1).  “The scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the \n                                                           \n4 “As the separate facilities provision in [34 C.F.R.] § 106.33 is permissive, states that authorize schools to \ndefine sex to include gender identity for purposes of providing separate restroom, locker room, showers, \nand other intimate facilities will not be impacted by [the preliminary injunction].”  Aug. 21, 2016 Order \n36–37, ECF No. 58. \n4 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 100   Filed 11/20/16    Page 5 of 6   PageID 1796\nextent of the violation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.”  Califano \nv. Yamaski, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). \n  A nationwide injunction is appropriate in this case because Plaintiffs have presented a \nstrong facial challenge to the Guidelines, arguing they violate the Administrative Procedures Act \n(“APA”) by skirting the notice and comment process and contradicting existing law.  Where a \nparty brings a facial challenge alleging that agency action violated APA procedures, a nationwide \ninjunction is appropriate.  See, e.g., Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d \n1399, 1407–08 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (invalidating an agency rule and affirming the nationwide \ninjunction); Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“When a reviewing \ncourt determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are \nvacated—not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.”).   \n  Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit regularly enjoin enforcement of new federal regulations \nchallenged as unlawful.  See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 743 (5th Cir. 2015) \n(enjoining executive order inconsistent with immigration statutes); Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nPerez, No. 5:16-cv-00066 (N.D. Tex. June 27, 2016), appeal pending (5th Cir.) (permanently \nenjoining  Department  of  Labor  persuader  rule  inconsistent  with  labor  statutes);  Associated \nBuilders & Contractors of Se. Tex. v. Rung, No. 1:16-cv-00425 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2016) \n(enjoining executive order and agency guidance inconsistent with labor statutes).  This injunction, \nand the justification for its nationwide scope, centers on agency regulations that Plaintiffs allege \nare invalid on their face.  But none of the authorities relied on by Defendants in their request for a \npartial stay center on agency regulations challenged as facially invalid.  See generally Defs.’ Mot., \nECF No. 95.  The Court finds the Guidelines’ alleged facial defects warrant broad injunctive relief. \n5 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 100   Filed 11/20/16    Page 6 of 6   PageID 1797\n  The Court also finds Defendants’ appeal to the importance of circuit splits unpersuasive \ngiven the Supreme Court’s recent grant of certiorari in G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. \nBd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016), recalling mandate & issuing stay, 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016), cert. \ngranted, 2016 WL 4565643 (U.S. Oct. 28, 2016) (No. 16-273).  The Supreme Court’s upcoming \nreview of G.G. diminishes the usual importance of a circuit split and may determine the legality \nof the Guidelines at issue here, abbreviating any alleged harm suffered by Defendants.  See Defs.’ \nMot. 12–14, ECF No. 95; see also Pls.’ Resp. 7–8, ECF No. 99.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  finds  that  Defendants  failed  to  demonstrate  a \nlikelihood  of  success  or  irreparable  harm  sufficient  to  justify  a  partial  stay  of  the  Court’s \npreliminary injunction.  Accordingly, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants’ Motion for a Partial \nStay of the Court’s August 21, 2016 Preliminary Injunction Order (ECF No. 95). \nSO ORDERED on this 20th day of November, 2016. \n6 \n ",

Defendants’  rewriting  of  Title  VII  and  Title  IX  is  wholly \nincompatible with Congressional text. Defendants cannot foist these radical changes \non the nation. \nI.  PARTIES \n \n1.  Plaintiff  State  of  Texas  is  subject  to  Title  VII  as  the  employer  of \nhundreds of thousands through its constituent agencies. The State of Texas also \noversees and controls several agencies that receive federal funding subject to Title \nIX. For example, the School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (“SBVI”) and School \nfor the Deaf (“SD”) are statutorily created, independent state agencies. Tex. Educ. \nCode § 30.001 et seq. Both are governed by nine-member boards, appointed by the \ngovernor and confirmed by the senate, and both have superintendents appointed by \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 3 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 4 of 42   PageID 245\n \nthe boards and “carry out the functions and purposes of [each] school according to any \ngeneral  policy  the  board[s]  prescribe[].”  Id.  §§  30.023(e)  (SBVI);  30.053(e)  (SD). \nCurrently, SBVI has a total budget of $24,522,116, of which $4,789,974 is identified \nas federal funds, and SD has a total budget of $28,699,653, of which $1,957,075 is \nidentified  as  federal  funds.  As  another  example,  the  Texas  Juvenile  Justice \nDepartment (“TJJD”) is a state agency, subject to Title VII and Title IX, responsible \nfor overseeing youth correction facilities in the State of Texas. TJJD’s current budget \nis $314,856,698, which includes $9,594,137 in federal funding.  \n2.  Plaintiff  Harrold  Independent  School  District  (“Harrold  ISD”)  is an \nindependent  public  school  district  based  in  Harrold,  Wilbarger  County,  Texas. \nAdditional information about Harrold ISD can be found infra.  \n3.

He is sued in his official \ncapacity.   \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this suit concerns the ultra vires revision of the term “sex” under multiple \nprovisions of the United States Code. This Court also has jurisdiction to compel an \nofficer of the United States or any federal agency to perform his or her duty pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 7 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 8 of 42   PageID 249\n \n20.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391 because the United States, several of its agencies, and several of its officers in \ntheir official capacity are Defendants; a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District; and Plaintiff Harrold ISD \n(TX) is both an employer subject to Title VII, and a recipient of federal monies subject \nto Title IX restrictions in Harrold, Wilbarger County, Texas. \n21.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory relief under \nthe  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”),  5  U.S.C.  § 706,  and  the  Declaratory \nJudgment Act (“DJA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. The Court is authorized to order \ncorrective action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), 5 U.S.C. § 611.  \nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n \nA.  Congressional History. \n \n22.  In 1964, Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, making it \nillegal for employers to invidiously discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.  \n23.  Eight  years  later,  Congress  passed  Title  IX  of  the  Education \nAmendments of 1972, proscribing invidious discrimination on the basis of “sex” in \nfederally funded education programs and activities. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Title IX \npermits  institutions to  differentiate  intimate  facilities  by  sex.  20 U.S.C.  § 1686 \n(“Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  chapter,  nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving \nfunds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 8 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 9 of 42   PageID 250\n \nsexes.”). Section 1686 was added to address concerns that Title IX would force a school \nto allow women in facilities designated for men only, and vice versa. When Senator \nBirch Bayh first introduced the legislation, Senator Dominick asked about the scope \nof the law: \nMr. DOMINICK. The provisions on page 1, under section 601, refer to \nthe fact that no one shall be denied the benefits of any program or \nactivity conducted, et cetera. The words “any program or activity,” in \nwhat way is the Senator thinking here? Is he thinking in terms of \ndormitory  facilities,  is  he  thinking  in  terms  of  athletic  facilities  or \nequipment, or in what terms are we dealing here? Or are we dealing with \njust educational requirements? \n  \nI think it is important, for example, because we have institutions of \nlearning which, because of circumstances such as I have pointed out, \nmay feel they do not have dormitory facilities which are adequate, or \nthey may feel, as some institutions are already saying, that you cannot \n[sexually]  segregate  dormitories  anyway.  But  suppose  they  want  to \n[sexually] segregate the dormitories; can they do it? \n  \nMr. BAYH. The rulemaking powers referred to earlier, I think, give the \nSecretary discretion to take care of this particular policy problem. I do \nnot read this as requiring integration of dormitories between the sexes, \nnor do I feel it mandates the [sexual] desegregation of football fields. \n  \nWhat we are trying to do is provide equal access for women and men \nstudents to the educational process and the extracurricular activities in \na school, where there is not a unique facet such as football involved. We \nare not requiring that intercollegiate football be desegregated, nor that \nthe men’s locker room be [sexually] desegregated. \n  \n117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971) (emphasis added). \n24.  The following year, when Title IX was passed, Senator Bayh again \nreiterated that this was not meant to force men and women to share intimate facilities \nwhere their privacy rights would be compromised: \nUnder this amendment, each Federal agency which extends Federal \nfinancial  assistance  is  empowered  to  issue  implementing  rules  and \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 9 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 10 of 42   PageID 251\n \nregulations effective after approval of the President. These regulations \nwould allow enforcing agencies to permit differential treatment by sex \nonly—very unusual cases where such treatment is absolutely necessary \nto the success of the program—such as in classes for pregnant girls or \nemotionally disturbed students, in sports facilities or other instances \nwhere personal privacy must be preserved. \n  \n118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972) (emphasis added). \n25.  Privacy  was  raised  when  Title  IX  was  debated  in  the  House. \nRepresentative Thompson, concerned about men and women using the same intimate \nfacilities, offered an amendment: \nI have been disturbed however, about the statements that if there is to be \nno discrimination based on sex then there can be no separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes. I have talked with the gentlewoman from \nOregon  (Mrs.  Green)  and  discussed  with  the  gentlewoman  an \namendment which she says she would accept. The amendment simply \nwould state that nothing contained herein shall preclude any educational \ninstitution from maintaining separate living facilities because of sex. So, \nwith  that  understanding  I  feel  that  the  amendment  [exempting \nundergraduate programs from Title IX] now under consideration should \nbe opposed and I will offer the “living quarters” amendment at the \nproper time. \n  \n117 Cong. Rec. 39260 (1971) (emphasis added). This amendment was eventually \nintroduced and passed. 117 Cong. Rec. 39263 (1971). \nB.  Aftermath of Title IX.  \n26.  At the time that Title IX was enacted, there was broad support behind \nthe policy of maintaining separate intimate facilities for female and male students. \nScholars defended the practice. See, e.g., Barbara A. Brown, Thomas I. Emerson, Gail \nFalk & Ann E. Freedman, The Equal Rights Amendment: A Constitutional Basis for \nEqual Rights for Women, 80 YALE L.J. 871, 901 (1971) (discussing the “separation of \nthe sexes in public rest rooms”). A 1971 article in the Harvard Law Review candidly \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 10 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 11 of 42   PageID 252\n \nremarked: “[T]here has never been any indication that men have wished to avoid \nintimate contact with women on a daily basis.” Note, Sex Discrimination and Equal \nProtection: Do We Need A Constitutional Amendment?, 84 HARV. L. REV. 1499, 1514 \n(1971). And a 1972 article in the Texas Law Review characterized restrictions on \naccessing bathrooms and changing areas as a commonsense “response to our society’s \nconcern for privacy and modesty.” Brian E. Berwick & Carol Oppenheimer, Marriage, \nPregnancy, and the Right to Go to School, 50 TEX. L. REV. 1196, 1228 n.116 (1972). \n27.  Following the enactment of Title IX, there continued to be significant \nbacking for the longstanding arrangement of maintaining sex-separated intimate \nfacilities. The initial rules promulgated to implement Title IX permitted separate \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of sex. 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nAnd legal scholars continued to defend sex-separated intimate facilities as necessary \nto preserve individual privacy rights. In a 1975 Washington Post editorial, then \nColumbia Law School Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that “[s]eparate places \nto disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations \nrequired, by regard for individual privacy.” Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights \nAmendment, WASH. POST, Apr. 7, 1975, at A21 (emphasis added). And in a 1977 \nreport, the United States Commission on Civil Rights concluded the “the personal \nprivacy principle permits maintenance of separate sleeping and bathroom facilities” \nfor women and men. United States Commission on Civil Rights, Sex Bias in the U.S. \nCode 216 (1977). Courts have recognized this privacy concern as well. In 1996, the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court  determined  that  in  admitting  female  students,  a \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 11 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 12 of 42   PageID 253\n \npreviously all-male military institute must “afford members of each sex privacy from \nthe other sex.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996).  \n28.  Congress  construes  its  prohibitions  against  invidious  “sex” \ndiscrimination narrowly. In 1974, Representatives Bella Abzug and Edward Koch \nproposed  to  amend  the  Civil  Rights  Act  to  add  the  new  category  of  “sexual \norientation.” H.R. 14752, 93rd Cong. (1974). Congress considered other similar bills \nduring the 1970s. See H.R. 166, 94th Cong. (1975); H.R. 2074, 96th Cong. (1979); \nS. 2081, 96th Cong. (1979). In 1994, lawmakers introduced the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act (“ENDA”) which, like Rep. Abzug and Koch’s earlier effort, was \npremised on the understanding that Title VII’s protections against invidious “sex” \ndiscrimination related only to one’s biological sex as male or female. H.R. 4636, 103rd \nCong. (1994). In 2007, 2009, and 2011, lawmakers proposed a broader version of \nEDNA to codify protections for “gender identity” in the employment context. H.R. \n2015, 110th Cong. (2007); H.R. 2981, 111th Cong. (2009); S. 811, 112th Cong. (2011). \nIn addition, in 2013 and 2015, proposals were made to add to Title IX the new \ncategory of “gender identity.” H.R. 1652, 113th Cong. (2013); S.439, 114th Cong. \n(2015). Notwithstanding the success or failure of the aforementioned Congressional \nproposals, they all affirmed Congress’s enduring understanding that “sex,” as a \nprotected class, refers only to one’s biological sex, as male or female, and not the \nradical re-authoring of the term now being foisted upon Americans by the collective \nefforts of Defendants.  \n29.  And when Congress actually did, in one instance, redefine the term “sex” \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 12 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 13 of 42   PageID 254\n \nfor the purposes of its prohibitions against invidious “sex” discrimination, the new \ndefinition did not encompass “gender identity.” Rather, in 1978, Congress broadened \nthe  statutory  term  “sex”  to  include  discrimination  “on  the  basis  of  pregnancy, \nchildbirth, or related conditions.” Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. \n95-555, § (k), 92 Stat. 2076, 2076 (1978). In amending the law in this way, Congress \nindicated that invidious “sex” discrimination occurs when females and males are not \nafforded the same avenues for advancement, i.e., when pregnant women may be \nlegally fired or not hired. Thus, this amendment affirmed Congress’s long-held view \nthat “sex” refers to biological sex, and not to an individual’s self-perception of his or \nher “gender identity.” \nC.  Secondary Sources.   \n30.  According to standard legal treatises, “gender identity” is not within the \nambit of Title VII. See, e.g., Margaret C. Jasper, Employment Discrimination Law \nUnder  Title  VII  45  (2d  ed.  2008)  (stating  that  Title  VII  makes  it  unlawful  “to \ndiscriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of his or her \nsex”); Mack A. Player, Employment Discrimination Law 239 (1988) (providing that \nthe  term  “sex”  for  the  purposes  of  Title  VII  generally  refers  to  the  division  of \norganisms into biological sexes); Charles A. Sullivan et al, Federal Statutory Law of \nEmployment  Discrimination  161  (1980)  (same).  Indeed,  “gender  identity”  was  a \nvirtually unrecognized construct among legal academics when Title VII and Title IX \nbecame law. It was not even mentioned in a law review article on the subject of Title \nVII or Title IX until the 1980s.  \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 13 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 14 of 42   PageID 255\n \n31.  “Gender identity” is a relatively recent addition to the social science \nlexicon. The 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey did not ask about men or \nwomen that identify as the opposite sex, nor did the first four waves of data collection \nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (begun in 1994 and last \nfielded in 2008). And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has so \nfar passed on doing so. Brian W. Ward et al, Sexual Orientation and Health Among \nU.S.  Adults:  National  Health  Interview  Survey,  2013,  77  NATIONAL  HEALTH \nSTATISTICS REPORTS 2 (2014). \n32.  Among the general public, “gender identity” also became a familiar \nconcept only of late. Law Professor Gail Heriot, a member of the United States \nCommission on Civil Rights, noted in her recent Congressional testimony that the \n1991 Compact Oxford English Dictionary does not define “transgender.” The Federal \nGovernment on Autopilot: Delegation of Regulatory Authority to an Unaccountable \nBureaucracy: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 114th Cong. 13 (2016) \n(statement  of  Gail  Heriot,  Member,  U.S.  Comm’n  on  Civil  Rights).  Likewise, \nnewspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times did not use the \nterm throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Id.  \n33.  While not a widely used term at the time President Nixon signed Title \nIX into law, “gender identity” was first used in 1963 at the 23rd International Psycho-\nAnalytical Congress in Stockholm. David Haig, The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the \nDecline of Sex: Social Change in Academic Titles, 1945–2001, ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL \nBEHAVIOR, Apr. 2004, at 93. Notably, early users of “gender” and “gender identity” \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 14 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 15 of 42   PageID 256\n \nunderstood these terms to mean something different than “sex.”  \n34.  In the 1950s, John Money, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University, \nintroduced “gender”—previously a grammatical term only—into scientific discourse.  \nJoanne Meyerowitz, A History of “Gender,” 113 THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW \n1346,  1353  (2008).  Money  believed  that  an  individual’s  “gender  role”  was  not \ndetermined at birth but was acquired early in a child’s development much in the same \nfashion  that  a  child  learns  a  language.  John  Money  et  al,  Imprinting  and  the \nEstablishment of Gender Role, 77 A.M.A. ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY \n333–36 (1957). Robert Stoller, the UCLA psychoanalyst who first used the term \n“gender identity,” was another early adopter of the terminology of “gender.” He wrote \nin  1968  that  gender  had  “psychological  or  cultural  rather  than  biological \nconnotations.” Robert J. Stoller, Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity \nand Femininity 9 (1968).  To him, “sex was biological but gender was social.” Haig, \nsupra, at 93.   \n35.  In  1969,  Virginia  Prince,  who  is  credited  with  coining  the  term \n“transgender,” echoed the view that “sex” and “gender” are distinct: “I, at least, know \nthe difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter \nand not the former. . . . I should be termed ‘trasngenderal.’” The Federal Government \non Autopilot, 114th Cong. 13 (Heriot statement) (quoting Virginia Prince, Change of \nSex or Gender, 10 TRANSVESTIA 53, 60 (1969)). And in the 1970s, feminist scholars \njoined the chorus differentiating “biological sex” from “socially assigned gender.” \nHaig, supra, at 93 (quoting Ethel Tobach, 41 Some Evolutionary Aspects of Human \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 15 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 16 of 42   PageID 257\n \nGender, AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY 710 (1971)).   \n36.  The  meaning  of  the  term  “sex”  has  remained  unchanged  since  the \nenactment of Title VII and Title IX. Around the time that these laws passed, nearly \nevery dictionary definition of “sex” referred to physiological distinctions between \nfemales and males, particularly with respect to their reproductive functions. See, e.g., \nAMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 1187 (1976) (“The property or quality by which \norganisms are classified according to their reproductive functions”); WEBSTER’S THIRD \nNEW  INTERNATIONAL  DICTIONARY  2081  (1971)  (“the  sum  of  the  morphological, \nphysiological, and behavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserves biparental \nreproduction  with  its  concomitant  genetic  segregation  and  recombination  which \nunderlie most evolutionary change . . .”); 9 OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 578 (1961) \n(“The sum of those differences in the structure and function of the reproductive \norgans on the ground of which beings are distinguished as male and female, and of \nthe other physiological differences consequent on these.”). Even today, “sex” continues \nto refer to biological differences between females and males. See, e.g., WEBSTER’S NEW \nWORLD COLLEGE DICTIONARY 1331 (5th ed. 2014) (“either of the two divisions, male \nor female, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their \nreproductive functions”); Sari L. Reisner et al, “Counting” Transgender and Gender-\nNonconforming Adults in Health Research, TRANSGENDER STUDIES QUARTERLY, Feb. \n2015, at 37 (“Sex refers to biological differences among females and males, such as \ngenetics, hormones, secondary sex characteristics, and anatomy.”).   \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 16 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 17 of 42   PageID 258\n \n37.  The meaning of “gender” has also remained essentially the same since \nthe term was introduced as a means of drawing a distinction between biological “sex” \nand social “gender.” See, e.g., Reisner et al, supra, at 37 (“Gender typically refers to \ncultural meanings ascribed to or associated with patterns of behavior, experience, \nand personality that are labeled as feminine or masculine.”). This usage of “gender” \nis  also  more  commonplace  now.  For  example,  the  2010  New  Oxford  American \nDictionary distinguishes between “sex,” defined in biological terms, and “gender,” \ndefined in social and cultural terms. NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 721–22, \n1600 (3d ed. 2010).  \nD.  Defendants’ Revisions of the Law.    \n38.  Current federal law reflects the emergence of “gender” and “gender \nidentity”  as  concepts  distinct  from  “sex.”  Congress  chose  recently  to  extend \nprotections for “gender identity” in certain areas of federal law. In 2010, President \nObama signed into law hate crimes legislation, 18 U.S.C. § 249, which applies to, inter \nalia, “gender identity.” Id. § 249(a)(2). The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst  Women  Act  (VAWA)  prohibits  recipients  of  certain  federal  grants  from \ndiscriminating  on  the  basis  of  both  “sex”  and  “gender  identity.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 13925(b)(13)(A).   \n39.  While Congress has added “gender identity” next to “sex” in other areas \nof federal law, it has not changed the terms of Title VII and Title IX. These laws \ncontinue  to  prohibit  unlawful  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  “sex.”  Since  2010, \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 17 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 18 of 42   PageID 259\n \nhowever, Defendants have pretended that these statutes were actually amended to \ncover the distinct concept of “gender identity.” For example:  \n  In a 2010 Dear Colleague Letter, the DOE’s Office for Civil Rights \n(“OCR”) asserted that “Title IX does protect all students, including . . . \ntransgender  (LGBT)  students,  from  sex  discrimination.”  OCR,  Dear \nColleague Letter: Harassment and Bullying, at 8 (Oct. 26, 2010) (Exhibit \nA).  \n  In April 2014, OCR stated that “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition \nextends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure \nto conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity.” OCR, \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence, at B-2 (Apr. 29, \n2014) (Exhibit B).  \n  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  issued  a  memo  in  December  2014 \nconcluding  that  Title  VII’s  reference  to  “sex”  “encompasses \ndiscrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status.” \nDOJ,  Memorandum  from  the  Attorney  General,  Treatment  of \nTransgender Employment Discrimination Claims Under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, at 2 (Dec. 15, 2014) (Exhibit C).  \n  And  in  2015,  OSHA  published  a  “guide”  for  employers  regarding \nrestroom access for employees who identify as the opposite sex. Press \nRelease,  OSHA,  OSHA  publishes  guide  to  restroom  access  for \ntransgender workers (June 1, 2015).

On February 22, 2016, the City Council of Charlotte, North Carolina, \namended the city’s Non-Discrimination Ordinance (Exhibit E), requiring that every \ngovernment  and  business  bathroom  and  shower,  however  designated,  be \nsimultaneously open to both sexes. In other words, Charlotte outlawed the right to \nmaintain separate sex intimate facilities throughout the city. The North Carolina \nGeneral Assembly then passed the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (“the \nAct”) (Exhibit F), preempting the Charlotte ordinance and providing that public \nemployees and public school students use bathrooms and showers correlating with \ntheir biological sex, defined as the sex noted on their birth certificate. The Act does \nnot establish a policy for private businesses and permits accommodations based on \nspecial circumstances.  \n41.  After  signing  the  Act,  on  April  12,  2016,  North  Carolina  Governor \nPatrick L. McCrory issued Executive Order No. 93 to Protect Privacy and Equality \n(“EO  93”)  (Exhibit  G). EO  93  expanded  non-discrimination  protections  to  state \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 19 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 20 of 42   PageID 261\n \nemployees on the basis of “gender identity,” while simultaneously affirming that \ncabinet  agencies  should  require  multiple  occupancy  intimate  facilities,  like \nbathrooms, to be designated for use only by persons based on their biological sex. EO \n93 directed cabinet agencies to make reasonable accommodations when practicable. \n42.  Nevertheless, on May 3, 2016, the EEOC released a document titled \n“Fact Sheet: Bathroom Access Rights for Transgender Employees Under Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964” (“Fact Sheet”) (Exhibit H). The Fact Sheet states that \nTitle VII’s prohibition of invidious discrimination on the basis of “sex” also now \nextends to “gender identity.” It further provides that employers that do not allow \nemployees to use the bathroom and other intimate facilities of their choosing are \nliable for unlawful discrimination on the basis of “sex.” \n43.  Then, on May 4, 2016, DOJ sent Governor McCrory a letter (Exhibit I), \ndeclaring that the Act and EO 93 violate both Title VII and Title IX. DOJ threatened \nto “apply to [an] appropriate court for an order that will ensure compliance with” its \nultra vires rewriting of the law.  \n44.  On May 9, 2016, DOJ sued North Carolina, asserting that both the Act \nand EO 93 are impermissible under federal law. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 20 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 21 of 42   PageID 262\n \nF.  The DOJ / DOE Joint Letter. \n45.   On May 13, 2016, DOJ and DOE issued a joint letter (“the Joint Letter”) \n(Exhibit J), officially foisting its new version of federal law on the more than 100,000 \nelementary and secondary schools that receive federal funding.  \n46.  The Joint Letter contends that Title IX’s prohibition of invidious “sex” \ndiscrimination also somehow encompasses discrimination based on “gender identity.” \nFurther, it advises that schools taking a different view of Title IX face legal action \nand the loss of federal funds. The Joint Letter concerns “Title IX obligations regarding \ntransgender students” and provides insight as to the manner in which DOJ and DOE \nwill evaluate how schools “are complying with their legal obligations” (emphasis \nadded). It  refers to  an accompanying  document  collecting  examples from  school \npolicies  and  recommends  that  school  officials  comb  through  the  document  “for \npractical ways to meet Title IX’s requirements” (same). Indeed, the Joint Letter \namounts to “significant guidance” (emphasis in original). \n47.  According to the Joint Letter, schools must treat a student’s “gender \nidentity” as the student’s “sex” for purposes of Title IX compliance, with one notable \nexception. “Gender identity,” the Joint Letter explains, refers to a person’s “internal \nsense of gender,” without regard to one’s biological sex. One’s “gender identity” can \nbe the same as a person’s biological sex, or different. The Joint Letter provides that \nno medical diagnosis or treatment requirement is a prerequisite to selecting one’s \n“gender identity,” nor is there any form of temporal requirement. In other words, a \nstudent can choose one “gender identity” on one particular day or hour, and then the \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 21 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 22 of 42   PageID 263\n \nopposite one the next. And students of any age may establish a “gender identity” \ndifferent from their biological sex simply by notifying the school administration—the \ninvolvement of a parent or guardian is not necessary. \n48.  In the case of athletics, however, the Joint Letter does not require \nschools to treat a student’s “gender identity” as the student’s “sex” for the purpose of \nTitle  IX  compliance.  Instead,  the  Joint  Letter  basically  leaves  intact  Title  IX \nregulations allowing schools to restrict athletic teams to members of one biological \nsex. The only change that the Joint Letter makes to athletic programs is that schools \nmay  not  “rely  on  overly  broad  generalizations  or  stereotypes”  about  students. \nOtherwise, differentiating sports teams on the basis of “sex”—not “gender identity”—\nis  consistent  with  the  Joint  Letter.  The  Joint  Letter’s  disparate  treatment  of \nbathrooms  and  showers,  on  the  one  hand,  and  athletic  teams,  on  the  other, \ndemonstrates that DOJ/DOE is not simply demanding that schools abide by Title IX \n(as misinterpreted to somehow include “gender identity”). Rather, the Joint Letter \ntries to rewrite Title IX by executive fiat, mandating all bathrooms and showers to be \nsimultaneously  open  to  both  sexes,  while  concurrently  permitting  different  sex \nathletics subject to limited exceptions. The new policy has no basis in law.   \n49.  Adapting to the new demands of DOJ and DOE requires significant \nchanges in the operations of the nation’s school districts. Schools subject to Title IX \nmust  allow  students  to  choose  the  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  other  intimate \nfacilities that match their chosen “gender identity” at any given time.

On May 17, 2016, the Attorneys General of Oklahoma, Texas, and West \nVirginia sent DOJ and DOE a letter (Exhibit K) requesting clarification on the effect \nof the Joint Letter on agencies within these States. DOJ and DOE did not respond.   \nG.  Harrold Independent School District (TX). \n \n51.  On  May  23,  2016,  school  board  members  of  the  Harrold  ISD  (“the \nBoard”) convened a regular session. At the session, the Board adopted a policy (“the \nPolicy”) (Exhibit L) consistent with its current practice. The Policy, which applies to \nstudents and employees of the Harrold ISD, limits multiple occupancy bathrooms and \nlocker rooms to usage by persons based on their biological sex. The Policy also allows \nfor accommodations. \n52.  After adopting the Policy, the Board requested representation (Exhibit \nM) from the Office of the Attorney General (“OAG”) of Texas, under Texas Education \nCode § 11.151(e), to determine whether the Policy is in conflict with federal law and, \nif so, whether the Policy is enforceable. The OAG agreed to represent the Board.    \n53.  Harrold ISD is subject to Title VII and receives federal funding subject \nto Title IX. In 2015–16, Harrold ISD operated on a total annual budget exceeding $1.4 \nmillion, with the federal portion amounting to approximately $117,000.  \n54.  Defendants have indicated they will enforce their revision of federal law \nagainst entities, such as Harrold ISD, that do not obey the new obligations unlawfully \nimposed on them. The Joint Letter of May 13, 2016, (Exhibit J) states that Title IX \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 23 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 24 of 42   PageID 265\n \nand  its  implementing  regulations  apply  to  “educational  programs  and  activities \noperated by recipients of Federal financial assistance” and that schools agree to same \n“as  a  condition  of  receiving  federal  assistance.” According  to  its  website,  DOE \n“vigorously enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial \nassistance  from  [DOE]  comply  with  the  law.”    DOE, \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html.  And  federal  regulations \nprovide for mandatory investigations into recipients of Title IX-linked funds who \ndiscriminate on the basis of “sex.” 34 C.F.R. §§ 100.7(a), 100.8, 106.71 (incorporating \nTitle VI procedures).   \n55.  Thus, the federal government possesses the ability to deny federal funds \nthat comprise a substantial portion of Harrold ISD’s budget if Harrold ISD chooses \nto follow its Policy instead of the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations \nof Defendants. As a result, Harrold ISD must budget and reallocate resources now in \norder to prepare for the prospective loss of federal funding. \nH.  Arizona Plaintiffs.   \n56.

Federal Education Funding.  \n57.  The loss of all federal funding for state and local education programs \nwill have a major effect on State and local education budgets. The $69,867,660,640 in \nannual funding makes its way to all 50 states. DOE, Funds for State Formula-\nAllocated and Selected Student Aid Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Funding, at 120, \navailable  at  http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/statetables/index.html \n(charts listing the amount of federal education funding by program nationally and by \nstate). DOE estimates that the federal government will spend over $36 billion in State \nand local elementary and secondary education, and over $30 billion in State and local \npostsecondary education programs in 2016.  \n58.  Not counting funds paid directly to state education agencies, or funds \npaid for non-elementary and secondary programs, the national amount of direct \nfederal  funding  to  public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  alone  exceeds \n$55,862,552,000 on average annually—which amounts to 9.3 percent of the average \nState’s total revenue for public elementary and secondary schools, or $1,128 per pupil.  \nTexas’s public elementary and secondary schools, for example, receive an average of \n$5,872,123,000 in federal funds annually, or $1,156 per pupil, which amounts to \nabout 11.7 percent of the State’s revenue for public elementary and secondary schools.  \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 25 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 26 of 42   PageID 267\n \n59.  Alabama’s  public  elementary  and  secondary  schools,  for  example, \nreceive an average of $850,523,000 in federal funds annually, or $1,142 per pupil, \nwhich amounts to about 11.8 percent of the State’s revenue for public elementary and \nsecondary  schools. West  Virginia’s public elementary  and  secondary  schools, for \nexample, receive an average of $380,192,000 in federal funds annually, or $1,343 per \npupil,  which  amounts  to  about  10.7  percent  of  the  State’s  revenue  for  public \nelementary and secondary schools. Wisconsin’s public elementary and secondary \nschools, for example, receive an average of $850,329,000 in federal funds annually, or \n$975 per pupil, which amounts to about 7.9 percent of the State’s revenue for public \nelementary and secondary schools.

Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \n67.

The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein go so far beyond any reasonable reading of the relevant Congressional text \nsuch  that  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  functionally \nexercise lawmaking power reserved only to Congress. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 1 (“All \nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in . . . Congress”) (emphasis added); \nThe Federalist No. 48, at 256 (James Madison) (Carey and McClellan eds. 1990) \n(noting that “[i]t is not unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies \nwhether the operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond the \nlegislative sphere,” but that “the executive power [is] restrained within a narrower \ncompass and . . . more simple in its nature”).    \n69.  The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein also violate separation of powers principles by purporting to expand federal \ncourt jurisdiction to cover whether persons of both sexes have a right to use previously \nseparate sex intimate facilities, an issue on which Congress has not intended to \nlegislate.

The  federal  government  is  one  of  limited,  enumerated  powers;  all \nothers—including a general police power—are reserved to the States. See United \nStates v.

The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  because  they  effectively  commandeer  the \nStates’ historic and well-established regulation of civil privacy law.

The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  described \nherein unlawfully attempt to preempt State law regarding rights of privacy because \nhistoric powers reserved to the States, such as civil privacy protections, cannot be \nsuperseded  by  federal  act,  “unless  that  was  the  clear  and  manifest  purpose  of \nCongress.” Rice v.

The new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations violate the \nconstitutional  right  to  the  equal  protection  of  law  because  they  treat  similarly \nsituated individuals differently. For example, under Defendants’ new rules, a female \nwho proclaims a male “gender identity” can use either the men’s or women’s restroom, \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 31 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 32 of 42   PageID 273\n \nbut a female who proclaims a female “gender identity” may use only the women’s \nrestroom. Thus, not all men or women are treated the same.  \n83.  Because the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations are \nnot in accordance with the law articulated above, they are unlawful, violate 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706, and should be set aside. \nCOUNT FIVE \nRelief Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that the \nnew Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations at Issue Unlawfully \nAttempt to Abrogate State Sovereign Immunity \n \n84.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 83 are reincorporated herein. \n85.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \n86.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)–(C). \n87.  The new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations improperly \nabrogate the States’ sovereign immunity without supporting Congressional findings. \n88.  The Supreme Court acknowledges Congress’s abrogation of the States’ \nsovereign  immunity  in  the  employment  context,  but  only  on  the  basis  of \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 32 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 33 of 42   PageID 274\n \nCongressional findings and concerns about unequal treatment between men and \nwomen, and not an employee’s decision on whether they declare themselves male or \nfemale. See, e.g., Nev. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 728 and n.2 (2003) \n(observing that the FMLA aims to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity \nfor women and men). \n89.  In adopting their new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations, \nthe Defendants point to no Congressional findings about invidious discrimination \nbased on “gender identity.” Indeed, the Defendants ignore the complete lack of any \nCongressional intent that the term “sex” include an individual’s right to choose his or \nher sex. The Defendants cannot expand abrogation of the State’s sovereign immunity \nby rewriting the meaning of “sex” employed by Congress.   \nCOUNT SIX \nRelief Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that new Rules, Regulations, Guidance \nand Interpretations at Issue Are Arbitrary and Capricious in that they \nInterfere with Local Schools   \n \n90.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 89 are reincorporated herein. \n91.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 33 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 34 of 42   PageID 275\n \n92.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n93.  Defendants’  actions—rewriting  federal  law  to  suit  their  own  policy \npreferences—are arbitrary and capricious and not otherwise in accordance with the \nlaw. Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious because they interfere with \nlocal schools by unilaterally changing the statutory term “sex”—long and widely \naccepted to be a biological category—to include “gender identity.” Title IX and Title \nVII do not refer to “gender identity.” Nor does 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which expressly \nauthorizes separate restrooms and locker rooms “on the basis of sex.” The federal \nlaws at issue prohibit disparate treatment “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33, a term long understood unambiguously to be a biological category \nbased principally on male or female reproductive anatomy, and not one that includes \nself-proclaimed “gender identity.” \nCOUNT SEVEN \nRelief Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that new Rules, Regulations, Guidance \nand Interpretations at Issue Are Arbitrary and Capricious in that they \nConflict with Federal Law \n \n94.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 93 are reincorporated herein. \n95.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 34 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 35 of 42   PageID 276\n \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \n96.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n97.  Under PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act), 42 U.S.C. § 15601 et seq., \nthose that identify as the opposite sex have the option to shower separately. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 115.42(f). Coupling this element in PREA with the new rules, regulations, guidance \nand interpretations at issue (where everyone may identify as the opposite sex, if they \nchoose to do so) means that every inmate can exercise a right to take a separate \nshower,  which  is  an  untenable  position  (and,  thus,  arbitrary  and  capricious), \nespecially within a correctional circumstance. \nCOUNT EIGHT \nRelief Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA) that the \nnew Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations at Issue Are \nUnlawful and Violate Constitutional Standards of Clear Notice \n \n98.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 97 are reincorporated herein. \n99.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 35 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 36 of 42   PageID 277\n \n100.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)–(C). \n101.  When  Congress  exercises  its  Spending  Clause  power,  conditions  on \nCongressional funds must enable the recipient to “clearly understand,” from the \nlanguage of the law itself, the conditions to which they are agreeing to when accepting \nthe federal funds. Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 \n(2006). Defendants’ ex-post rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described \nherein are not in accord with the understanding that existed when the States opted \ninto the programs. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985) (providing that a \nstate’s  obligation  under  cooperative  federalism  program  ‘‘generally  should  be \ndetermined by reference to the law in effect when the grants were made’’).   \n102.  The text employed by Congress does not support understanding the \nterm “sex” in the manner put forth by Defendants. Congress expressed its intent to \ncover “gender identity,” as a protected class, in other pieces of legislation, see, e.g., 18 \nU.S.C.  §  249(a)(2)(A);  42  U.S.C.  §  13925(b)(13)(A),  but  not  Title  IX.  In  other \nlegislation, Congress included “gender identity” along with “sex,” thus evidencing its \nintent for “sex” in Title IX to retain its original and only meaning—one’s immutable, \nbiological sex as acknowledged at or before birth. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 36 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 37 of 42   PageID 278\n \nCOUNT NINE \nDeclaratory Judgment Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (APA) that the new Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations \nat Issue Are Unlawful and Unconstitutionally Coercive \n \n103.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 102 are reincorporated herein. \n104.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations described herein are “rules” \nunder the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by \nstatute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \n105.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \naction that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)–(C). \n106.  By placing in jeopardy a substantial percentage of Plaintiffs’ budgets if \nthey refuse to comply with the new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations \nof Defendants, Defendants have left Plaintiffs no real choice but to acquiesce in such \npolicy. See NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2605 (“The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a \nState’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States with \nno real option but to acquiesce . . . .”). \n107.  “The legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power ‘thus rests \non  whether  the  [entity]  voluntarily  and  knowingly  accepts  the  terms  of  the \n‘contract.’’” NFIB,  132  S.  Ct. at 2602  (quoting  Pennhurst State  Sch.  & Hosp.  v. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 37 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 38 of 42   PageID 279\n \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). “Congress may use its spending power to create \nincentives for [entities] to act in accordance with federal policies. But when ‘pressure \nturns  into  compulsion,’  the  legislation  runs  contrary  to  our  system  of \nfederalism.” Id. (quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)). \n“That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly \ncoerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.” Id. \n108.  “[T]he financial ‘inducement’ [Defendants have] chosen is much more \nthan ‘relatively mild encouragement’ – it is a gun to the head.” Id. at 2604. When \nconditions  on the  receipt  of funds “take  the  form  of threats  to  terminate  other \nsignificant independent grants, the conditions are properly viewed as a means of \npressuring the states to accept policy changes.” Id.; cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n203, 211 (1987). \n109.  Furthermore, the Spending Clause requires that entities “voluntarily \nand knowingly accept[]” the conditions for the receipt of federal funds. NFIB, 132 S. \nCt. at 2602 (quoting Halderman, 451 U.S. at 17). \n110.  Because  Defendants’  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations  change  the  conditions  for  the  receipt  of  federal  funds  after  the \nacceptance of Congress’s original conditions, the Court should declare that the new \nrules, regulations, guidance and interpretations are unconstitutional because they \nviolate the Spending Clause. \n \n \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 38 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 39 of 42   PageID 280\n \nCOUNT TEN \nDeclaratory Judgment Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (DJA) and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 611 (RFA) that the new Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations \nWere Issued Without a Proper Regulatory Flexibility Analysis \n \n111.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 through 110 are reincorporated herein. \n112.  Before  issuing  any  of  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations at issue, Defendants failed to prepare and make available for public \ncomment an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis as required by the RFA. \n5 U.S.C. § 603(a). An agency can avoid performing a flexibility analysis if the agency’s \ntop official certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities. Id. § 605(b). The certification must include a \nstatement providing the factual basis for the agency’s determination that the rule \nwill not significantly impact small entities. Id.  \n113.  The  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and  interpretations  impact  a \nsubstantial number of small entities because they require public schools receiving \nTitle IX-linked funds either to comply or lose a significant portion of their budgets. \nNone of the Defendants even attempted such a certification. Thus, the Court should \ndeclare Defendants’ new rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations unlawful \nand set them aside.  \nV.  DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief from the Court: \nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   Page 39 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 6   Filed 06/15/16    Page 40 of 42   PageID 281\n \n114.

A  declaration  that  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations are substantively unlawful under the APA; \n116.  A  declaration  that  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations are arbitrary and capricious under the APA; \n117.  A  declaration  that  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations are invalid because they abrogate Plaintiffs’ sovereign immunity; \n118.  A  declaration  that  the  new  rules,  regulations,  guidance  and \ninterpretations  are  invalid  because  Defendants  failed  to  conduct  the  proper \nregulatory flexibility analysis required by the RFA. \n119.  A vacatur, as a consequence of each or any of the declarations aforesaid, \nas  to  the  Defendants’  promulgation,  implementation,  and  determination  of \napplicability of the Joint Letter, and its terms and conditions, along with all related \nrules, regulations, guidance and interpretations, as issued and applied to Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated parties throughout the United States, within the jurisdiction \nof this Court.   \n120.

(“Plaintiffs”) \nhereby move for a 30-day extension of time to file their appellees’ brief.   \n1.  As confirmed by the Clerk’s Office, Plaintiffs’ appellees’ brief is currently \ndue February 6, 2017.1  Plaintiffs seek a 30-day extension of time, until March 8, \n2017, to file their appellees’ brief.  This is Plaintiffs’ first request for an extension of \ntime in this appeal. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with Jeffrey Sandberg, counsel for Defendants, \nwho stated that Defendants are unopposed to a 30-day extension of time. Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel also conferred with Ezra Young, counsel for Dr. Tudor, who stated that Dr. \nTudor will oppose the requested extension.2 \n3.  The  requested  extension  is  necessary  because  Plaintiffs’  counsel  has \nnumerous other appellate deadlines falling on or close to the existing February 6 \nbriefing deadline: \n•  Sterling v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court No. 16-814 (certiorari-stage \namicus curiae brief due January 27, 2017); \n                                                \n1. Movant-Appellant Dr. Rachel Tudor filed her opening brief on January 3, 2017, and Defendants-\nAppellants the United States et al. (“Defendants”) filed their brief on January 6. The Clerk’s \nOffice confirmed that, when two appellants’ briefs are filed, the deadline for a single appellee’s \nbrief addressing both appellants’ briefs is 30 days after the filing date of the later-filed appellant’s \nbrief. Here, because the thirtieth day after January 6 is Sunday, February 5, the deadline is Monday, \nFebruary 6. See Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C). \n2. Because Dr. Tudor has not been permitted to intervene in the district court and has not \nchallenged in this Court the district court’s failure to rule on her intervention motion, Plaintiffs do \nnot believe that she is a party for purposes of Fifth Circuit Rule 27.4. Plaintiffs have conferred with \nher counsel in an abundance of caution to ensure compliance with Rule 27.4. \n2 \n\n•  Young v. Davis, U.S. Supreme Court No. 16-7032 (brief in opposition to \ncertiorari in a capital case due January 30, 2017); \n•  TC Heartland, LLC v. Kraft Food Group Brands LLC, U.S. Supreme \nCourt No. 16-341 (merits-stage amicus curiae brief due February 6, 2017);  \n•  King  Street  Patriots  v.

Davis, U.S. Supreme Court No. 16-6795 (brief in opposition to \ncertiorari in a capital case due February 8, 2017).  \nIn addition to those deadlines, the Court notified the parties yesterday that oral \nargument on Defendants’ Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal will be heard on \nFebruary 14, 2017. The requested extension will give Plaintiffs’ counsel much-\nneeded time to meet these deadlines and will not materially delay the resolution of \nthis appeal. \n4.   The extension of time is sought in the interest of justice, not for delay, and \nno party will be prejudiced if the requested extension is granted. \n5.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \ngrant their motion for a 30-day extension of time to file their Appellees’ brief, up to \nand including March 8, 2017. In the alternative, Plaintiffs request that the Court \ngrant a shorter extension of time. \n \n3 \n \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKen Paxton  /s/ Scott A.

See ECF No. 56.1   \n  This case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students’ rights and \nthat of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate \nfacilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized while attending school.  \nThe sensitivity to this matter is heightened because Defendants’ actions apply to the youngest \nchild attending school and continues for every year throughout each child’s educational career.  \nThe resolution of this difficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this Order.  Instead, the \n                                                           \n1 The Court also considers various amicus briefs filed by interested parties.

If so, then the Court must determine whether Defendants \nfailed to follow the proper legal procedures before issuing the Guidelines in dispute and, if they \nfailed to do so, whether the Guidelines must be suspended until Congress acts or Defendants \nfollow  the  proper  legal  procedure.    For  the  following  reasons,  the  Court  concludes  that \njurisdiction  is  proper  here  and  that  Defendants  failed  to  comply  with  the  Administrative \nProcedures Act by: (1) foregoing the Administrative Procedures Act’s notice and comment \nrequirements; and (2) issuing directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory \ntexts.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be and is hereby GRANTED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  The following factual recitation is taken from Plaintiffs’ Application for Preliminary \nInjunction (ECF No. 11) unless stated otherwise.  Plaintiffs are composed of 13 states and \nagencies represented by various state leaders, as well as Harrold Independent School District of \nTexas and Heber-Overgaard Unified School District of Arizona.2  They have sued the U.S. \nDepartments of Education (“DOE”), Justice (“DOJ”), Labor (“DOL”), the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and various agency officials (collectively “Defendants”), \nchallenging Defendants’ assertions that Title VII and Title IX require that all persons must be \nafforded the opportunity to have access to restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate \n                                                           \n2 Plaintiffs include: (1) the State of Texas; (2) Harrold Independent School District (TX); (3) the State of \nAlabama; (4) the State of Wisconsin; (5) the State of West Virginia; (6) the State of Tennessee; (7) \nArizona Department of Education; (8) Heber-Overgaard Unified School District (Arizona); (9) Paul \nLePage, Governor of the State of Maine; (10) the State of Oklahoma; (11) the State of Louisiana; (12) the \nState of Utah; (13) the state of Georgia; (14) the State of Mississippi, by and through Governor Phil \nBryant; (15) the Commonwealth of Kentucky, by and through Governor Matthew G. Bevin.   \n2 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 3 of 38   PageID 1013\nfacilities which match their gender identity rather than their biological sex.3  Plaintiffs claim that \non May 13, 2016, Defendants wrote to schools across the country in a Dear Colleague Letter on \nTransgender Students (the “DOJ/DOE Letter”) and told them that they must “immediately allow \nstudents to use the bathrooms, locker rooms and showers of the student’s choosing, or risk losing \nTitle IX-linked funding.”  Mot. Injunction 1, ECF No. 11.  Plaintiffs also allege Defendants have \nasserted that employers who “refuse to permit employees to utilize the intimate areas of their \nchoice  face  legal  liability  under  Title  VII.”    Id.    Plaintiffs  complain  that  Defendants’ \ninterpretation  of  the  definition  of  “sex”  in  the  various  written  directives  (collectively  “the \nGuidelines”)4 as applied to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) is unlawful and has placed them in legal \njeopardy.     \n  Plaintiffs contend that when Title IX was signed into law, neither Congress nor agency \nregulators and third parties “believed that the law opened all bathrooms and other intimate \nfacilities to members of both sexes.”  Mot. Injunction. 1, ECF No. 11.  Instead, they argue one of \nTitle IX’s initial implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (“§ 106.33” or “Section 106.33”), \n                                                           \n3 Plaintiffs refer to a person’s “biological sex” when discussing the differences between males and \nfemales, while Defendants refer to a person’s sex based on the sex assigned to them at birth and reflected \non their birth certificate or based on “gender identity” which is “an individual’s internal sense of gender.”  \nSee Am. Compl. 12, ECF No. 6; Mot. Injunction 1, ECF No. 11; Am. Compl. Ex. C (Holder Transgender \nTitle VII Memo) (“Holder Memo 2014”) App. 1 n.1, ECF No. 6-3 (“‘[G]ender identity’ [is defined] as an \nindividual’s internal senses of being male or female.”); Id. at Ex. J. (DOJ/DOE Letter) 2, ECF No. 6-10.  \nWhen referring to a transgendered person, Defendants’ Guidelines state “transgender individuals are \npeople with a gender identity that is different from the sex assigned to them at birth . . . .”  Am. Compl.,  \nEx. C (Holder Memo 2014), App. 1 n.1, ECF No. 6-3.  “For example, a transgender man may have been \nassigned female at birth and raised as a girl, but identify as a man.”  Id. at Ex. D (OSHA Best Practices \nGuide to Restroom Access for Transgender Employees) (“OSHA Best Practice Guide”), App. 1, ECF No. \n6-4.  The Court attempts to use the parties’ descriptions throughout this Order for the sake of clarity.  \n4 The Guidelines refer to the documents attached to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint: (1) Ex. A (DOE \nBullying Memo 2010), ECF No. 6-1; (2) Ex. B (DOE Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence Memo) (“DOE Q&A Memo), ECF No. 6-2; (3) Ex.

J (DOJ/DOE Dear Colleague Letter), ECF No. 6-10.   \n3 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 4 of 38   PageID 1014\nexpressly authorized separate  restrooms on the basis of sex.  Section 106.33 provides: “A \nrecipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but \nsuch facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for \nstudents of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Plaintiffs assert the term sex in the pertinent \nstatutes and regulations means the biological differences between a male and female.  Mot. \nInjunction  2,  ECF  No.  11.    Plaintiffs  state  that  Defendants’  swift  move  to  supplant  the \ntraditional, biological meaning of sex with a definition based on gender identity through the \nGuidelines, coupled with Defendants’ actions to enforce these new agency policies through \ninvestigations and compliance reviews, causes Plaintiffs to suffer irreparable harm for which a \npreliminary injunction is needed.  Id. at 3–8; Pls.’ Reply 3–7, ECF No. 54.   \n  Defendants contend that the Guidelines and recent enforcement actions are designed to \nprohibit  sex  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  gender  identity  and  are  “[c]onsistent  with  the \nnondiscrimination mandate of [Title IX],” and that “these guidance documents . . . are merely \nexpressions of the agencies’ views as to what the law requires.”  Defs.’ Resp. 2–4, ECF No. 40.  \nDefendants also contend that the Guidelines “are not legally binding, and they expose [P]laintiffs \nto no new liability or legal requirements” because DOE “has issued documents of this nature for \ndecades, across multiple administrations, in order to notify schools and other recipients of federal \nfunds about how the agency interprets the law and how it views new and emerging issues.”  Id. at \n4–5.5  Defendants also state that the “[g]uidance documents issued by [DOE] ‘do not create or \nconfer any rights for or on any person and do not impose any requirements beyond those \nrequired under applicable law and regulations’” and these documents expressly state that they do \n                                                           \n5 Defendants cited to U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, Sex Discrimination Policy Guidance, \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/sex.html (last visited August 5, \n2016) (discussing the purpose of guidance documents and providing links to guidance documents).   \n4 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 5 of 38   PageID 1015\nnot carry the force of law.  Id. at 5 (citing Holder Memo 2, ECF No. 6-10, to clarify that “the best \nreading of Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination is that it encompasses discrimination \nbased  on  gender  identity,  including  transgender  status,”  but  the  memo  “is  not  intended  to \notherwise prescribe the course of litigation or defenses that should be raised in any particular \nemployment discrimination case”).  \nA.  TITLE IX  \n  Title IX, enacted in 1972, is the landmark legislation which prohibits discrimination \namong federal fund recipients by providing that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be \nsubjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 USC § 1681.  The legislative history shows Congress hailed Title IX as an \nindelible step forward for women’s rights.  Mot. Injunction at 2–4.  After its passage, the DOE \nand its predecessor implemented a number of regulations which sought to enforce Title IX, chief \namong them, and at issue here, § 106.33.  See G.G. ex rel Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., \n822 F.3d 709, 721 (4th Cir. 2016) (stating that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \n(“HEW”) adopted its Title IX regulations in 1975 pursuant to 40 Fed. Reg. 24,128 (June 4, \n1975), and DOE implemented its regulations in 1980 pursuant to 45 Fed. Reg. 30802, 30955 \n(May 9, 1980)).  Section 106.33, as well as several other related regulations, permit educational \ninstitutions to separate students on the basis of sex, provided the separate accommodations are \ncomparable.  \nII.

Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 61 (2004) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  “Where no \nother statute provides a private right of action, the ‘agency action’ complained of must be final \nagency action.’”  Id. at 61–62 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704).6  In the Fifth Circuit, “final agency \naction”  is  a  jurisdictional  threshold,  not  a  merits  inquiry.    Texas  v.  Equal  Employment \nOpportunity  Comm’n,  No.  14-10949,  2016  WL  3524242  at  *5  (5th  Cir.  June  27,  2016) \n(“EEOC”); see also Peoples Nat’l Bank v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the \nUnited States, 362 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir. 2004) (“If there is no ‘final agency action,’ a federal \ncourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction.” (citing Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Herman, 176 F.3d 283, 287 \n(5th Cir. 1999))).   \nAn administrative action is “final agency action” under the APA if: (1) the agency’s \naction is the “consummation of the agency’s decision making process;” and (2) “the action [is] \none by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences \nwill flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (quoting Chicago & Southern Air \nLines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948); and Port of Boston Marine \nTerminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)).  “In evaluating \nwhether a challenged agency action meets these two conditions, this court is guided by the \nSupreme Court’s interpretation of the APA’s finality requirement as ‘flexible’ and ‘pragmatic.’”  \nEEOC, 2016 WL 3524242, at *5; Qureshi v. Holder, 663 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting \n                                                           \n6 Agency action is defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(13) to include “the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, \nlicense, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”   Norton v. S. Utah \nWilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(13)).  “All of those categories \ninvolve circumscribed, discrete agency actions, as their definitions make clear: ‘an agency statement of . . \n. future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy’ (rule); ‘a final disposition . . . \nin a matter other than rule making’ (order); a ‘permit . . . or other form of permission’ (license); a \n‘prohibition . . . or . . . taking [of] other compulsory or restrictive action’ (sanction); or a ‘grant of money, \nassistance, license, authority,’ etc., or ‘recognition of a claim, right, immunity,’ etc., or ‘taking of other \naction on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a person’ (relief).”  Id. (quoting § 551(4), (6), \n(8), (10), (11)).   \n6 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 7 of 38   PageID 1017\nAbbott  Labs.  v.  Gardner,  387  U.S.  136,  149–50  (1967)).    When  final  agency  actions  are \npresented for judicial review, the APA provides that reviewing courts should hold unlawful and \nset aside agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with the law.  Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 499 U.S. \n144, 150–151 (1991).     \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \nThe Fifth Circuit set out the requirements for a preliminary injunction in Canal Authority \nof State of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974).  To prevail on a preliminary \ninjunction, the movant must show: (1) a substantial likelihood that the movant will ultimately \nprevail on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the \ninjunction is  not  granted;  (3) that the threatened injury to  the movant  outweighs whatever \ndamage  the  proposed  injunction  may  cause  the  opposing  party;  and  (4)  that  granting  the \ninjunction is not adverse to the public interest.  Id.; see also Nichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc., 532 \nF.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir. 2008). \nTo qualify for a preliminary injunction, the movant must clearly carry the burden of \npersuasion  with  respect  to  all  four  requirements.    Karaha  Bodas  Co.  v.  Perusahaan \nPertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 335 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2003).  If the movant \nfails to establish any one of the four prerequisites to injunctive relief, relief will not be granted.  \nWomen’s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Hous. v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 n.15 (5th Cir. 2001).  A movant who \nobtains a preliminary injunction must post a bond to secure the non-movant against any wrongful \ndamages it suffers as a result of the injunction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). \n  The decision to grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief is left to the sound discretion \nof the district court.  Miss. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 760 F.2d 618, 621 \n7 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 8 of 38   PageID 1018\n(5th Cir. 1985) (citing Canal, 489 F.2d at 572).  A preliminary injunction “is an extraordinary \nand drastic remedy, not to be granted routinely, but only when the movant, by a clear showing, \ncarries the burden of persuasion.”  White v. Carlucci, 862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir. 1989) \n(quoting Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir. 1985)).  Even \nwhen a movant satisfies each of the four Canal factors, the decision whether to grant or deny a \npreliminary injunction remains discretionary with the district court.  Miss. Power & Light Co., \n760 F.2d at 621.  The decision to grant a preliminary injunction is to be treated as the exception \nrather than the rule.  Id.  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n  Plaintiffs argue that: (1) Defendants skirted the notice and comment process—a necessity \nfor legislative rules; (2) the new mandates are incompatible with Title VII and Title IX and the \nagencies are not entitled to deference; (3) the mandates violate the clear notice and anti-coercion \nrequirements  which  the  federal  government  may  attach  to  spending  programs;  and  (4) \nnationwide relief is necessary to prevent the irreparable harm Defendants will cause Plaintiffs.  \nMot. Injunction 2–3, ECF No. 11.   \n  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction because: (1) \nPlaintiffs do not have standing to bring their claims; (2) this matter is not ripe for review; (3) \nDefendants’ Guidelines do not violate the APA; (4) Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate irreparable \nharm and they have an alternative remedy; (5) Defendants did not violate the Spending Clause; \n(6) and an injunction would harm Defendants and third parties.  Defs.’ Resp. 1–3, ECF No. 40.  \nDefendants  allege  that  should  an  injunction  be  granted,  it  should  be  implemented  only  to \n8 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 9 of 38   PageID 1019\nPlaintiffs in the Fifth Circuit.  Id.  The Court addresses these issues, beginning with Defendants’ \njurisdictional arguments.7 \nA.  Jurisdiction  \n1.  Standing  \n  Defendants allege that “[P]laintiffs’ suit fails the jurisdictional requirements of standing \nand ripeness . . . because they have not alleged a cognizable concrete or imminent injury.”  \nDefs.’ Resp. 12, ECF No. 40 (citing Lopez v. City of Hous., 617 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. 2015)).  \nDefendants  allege  “a  plaintiff  must  demonstrate  that  it  has  ‘suffered  an  injury  in  fact—an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’”  Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560 (1992)).  Defendants contend that “[t]he agencies have merely set forth their views as to \nwhat the law requires” regarding whether gender identity is included in the definition of sex, and \n“[a]t  this  stage,  [P]laintiffs  have  alleged  no  more  than  an  abstract  disagreement  with  the \nagencies’ interpretation of the law,” since “[n]o concrete situation has emerged that would permit \nthe  Court  to  evaluate  [P]laintiffs’  claims  in  terms  of  specific  facts  rather  than  abstract \nprinciples.”  Id. at 13–14.  \n  Defendants also allege that Plaintiffs “have [not] identified any enforcement action to \nwhich they are or are about to be subject in which a defendant agency is seeking to enforce its \n                                                           \n7 The parties have requested that the Court provide expedited consideration of the preliminary injunction. \nThe briefing on this request was completed on August 3, 2016, and the matter was not ripe until after the \nhearing was completed on August 12, 2016.  Because further legal issues concerning the basis for \nPlaintiffs’ Spending Clause claim were raised at the hearing and require further briefing, the Court will \nnot await that briefing at this time.  See Hr’g Tr. 35, 44, 52–53 (discussing new program requirements and \nwhether a new program is the same as annual grants).  Therefore, the Spending Clause issue is not \naddressed in this Order.  See ECF Nos. 11–12.  Finally, where referenced, Title VII is used to help explain \nthe legislative intent and purpose of Title IX because the two statutes are commonly linked.  N. Haven Bd. \nof Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 546 (1982). \n9 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 10 of 38   PageID 1020\nview of the law. As such, any injury alleged by plaintiffs is entirely speculative, as it depended \non the initiation of some kind of enforcement action . . . which may never occur.”  Defs.’ Resp. \n14, ECF No. 40. \n  Plaintiffs state that Defendants are affirmatively using the Guidelines to force compliance \nas evidenced by various resolution agreements reached in enforcement cases across the country \nand from the litigation against the state of North Carolina, all of which is designed to force \nPlaintiffs to amend their policies to comply or place their federal funding in jeopardy.  Hr’g Tr. \nat 78.  Plaintiffs argue they are clearly the object of the Defendants’ Guidelines, and those \ndirectives run afoul of various state constitutional and statutory codes which permit Plaintiffs to \nexercise control of their education premises and facilities.8  Hr’g Tr. at 77.

Defendants primarily distinguish EEOC from this case \nbased on the EEOC majority’s view that the “guidance [at issue] contained a ‘safe harbor’ \n[provision]” and “the [guidance at issue had] the immediate effect of altering the rights and \nobligations of the ‘regulated community’ . . . by offering them [] detailed and conclusive means \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nfacilities for both sexes.’”); W.

Defendants claim that the \nsame kind of facts are not present here.  Defendants contend further that “the [transgender] \nguidance documents do not provide ‘an exhaustive procedural framework,’ [or] . . . a safe harbor, \nbut merely express[] the agencies’ opinion about the proper interpretation of Title VII and Title \nIX.”  Id.  Thus, they argue, the Court lacks jurisdiction and should decline to enter a preliminary \ninjunction.  Id.10   \n  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing.  “The doctrine of standing asks ‘whether \nthe litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.’”  \nCibolo Waste, Inc. v. City of San Antonio, 718 F.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Elk Grove \nUnified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11 (2004)).  Constitutional standing requires a plaintiff \nto establish that she has suffered an injury in fact traceable to the defendant’s actions that will be \nredressed by a favorable ruling.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61.  The injury in fact must be “concrete \nand particularized” and “actual or imminent,” as opposed to “conjectural” or “hypothetical.”  Id. \nat 560.  When “a plaintiff can establish that it is an ‘object’ of the agency regulation at issue, \n‘there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused [the plaintiff] injury, and \nthat a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.’”  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at \n*2; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62.  The Fifth Circuit provided, “[w]hether someone is in fact an \nobject  of  a  regulation  is  a  flexible  inquiry  rooted  in  common  sense.”    Id.  at  *6  (quoting \nContender Farms LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 265 (5th Cir. 2015)).   \n  In  EEOC,  Texas  sued  the  EEOC  over  employment  guidance  the  EEOC  issued  to \nemployers concerning their Title VII obligations.  In response, the EEOC argued Texas lacked \nstanding because the guidance was advisory only and imposed no affirmative obligation.

Id. at *4.  \n  This case is analogous.  Defendants’ Guidelines are clearly designed to target Plaintiffs’ \nconduct.  At the hearing, Defendants conceded that using the definition in the Guidelines means \nPlaintiffs are not in compliance with their Title VII and Title IX obligations.  Hr’g Tr. 74.  \nDefendants argue that that this does not confer standing because the Guidelines are advisory \nonly.  Defs.’ Resp. 14, ECF No. 40.  But this conflates standing with final agency action and the \nFifth Circuit instructed district courts to address the two concepts separately.  See EEOC, 2016 \nWL 3524242 at *3.  Defendants’ Guidelines direct Plaintiffs to alter their policies concerning \nstudents’ access to single sex toilet, locker room, and shower facilities, forcing them to redefine \nwho may enter apart from traditional biological considerations.11  Plaintiffs’ counsel argued the \nGuidelines will force Plaintiffs to consider ways to build or reconstruct restrooms, and how to \naccommodate students who may seek to use private single person facilities, as other school \ndistricts and employers who have been subjected to Defendants’ enforcement actions have had to \ndo.  Hr’g Tr. 80–81.  That the Guidelines spur this added regulatory compliance analysis satisfies \nthe injury in fact requirement.  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *4 (“[T]he guidance does, at the \nvery least, force Texas to undergo an analysis, agency by agency, regarding whether the certainty \nof EEOC investigations . . . overrides the State’s interest . . . . [T]hese injuries are sufficient to \nconfer  constitutional  standing,  especially  when  considering  Texas’s  unique  position  as  a \nsovereign state . . . .”).  That Plaintiffs have standing is strengthened by the fact that Texas and \n                                                           \n11 For example, Plaintiffs list Wisconsin’s state statutes regarding this matter, which state that school \nboards are required to “[p]rovide and maintain enough suitable and separate toilets and other sanitary \nfacilities for both sexes.”  Mot. Injunction 10 n.9, ECF No. 11 (citing Wis. Stat. s. 120.12(12)).  Plaintiffs \ninterpret this to mean that Wisconsin has the authority to maintain separate intimate facilities that \ncorrespond to a person’s biological sex.  Id.  \n13 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 14 of 38   PageID 1024\nother Plaintiffs have a “stake in protecting [their] quasi-sovereign interests . . .

Given that procedural right and Massachusetts’ stake in protecting its \nquasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude in our standing \nanalysis.”). \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to pursue this lawsuit.   \n2.  Ripeness  \n  Defendants also argue that this case is not ripe for review.  According to Defendants, this \nCourt should avoid premature adjudication to avoid entangling itself in abstract disagreements \nover administrative policies.  Defs.’ Resp. 13, ECF No. 40 (citing Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. \nDep.’t Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807 (2003)).  Defendants argue that more time should be given to \nallow the administrative process to run its course and develop more facts before the Court can \naddress this case.  Id. at 13 (citing Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)); Hr’g Tr. 62.  \nPlaintiffs counter that, taking into account recent events where Defendants have investigated \nother entities that do not comply with the Guidelines, this case is ripe.  Pls.’ Reply 4–7, ECF No. \n52; Hr’g Tr. 79.  \n  “A challenge to administrative regulations is fit for review if (1) the questions presented \nare ‘purely legal one[s],’ (2) the challenged regulations constitute ‘final agency action,’ and (3) \nfurther factual development would not ‘significantly advance [the court’s] ability to deal with the \nlegal issues presented.’”  Texas v. United States, 497 F.3d 491, 498–99 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing \nNat'l Park Hosp.

Here, the parties agree that the \nquestions at issue are purely legal.  Hr’g Tr. 61.  Defendants asserted at the hearing that Plaintiffs \nare not in compliance with their obligations under Title IX given their refusal to change their \npolicies.    Hr’g  Tr.  74.    Furthermore,  for  the  reasons  set  out  below,  the  Court  finds  that \nDefendants’ actions amount to final agency action under the APA.12  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 \nat *11 n.9 (“Having determined that the Guidance is ‘final agency action’ under the APA, it \nfollows naturally that Texas’s APA claim is ripe for review. Texas’s challenge to the EEOC \nGuidance  is  a  purely  legal  one,  and  as  such  it  is  unnecessary  to  wait  for  further  factual \ndevelopment before rendering a decision.”) (Internal citations omitted).   \n  Finally, the facts of this case have sufficiently developed to address the legal impact \nDefendants’ Guidelines have on Plaintiffs’ legal questions in this case.  Texas, 497 F.3d at 498–\n99.  The only other factual development that may occur, given Defendants’ conclusion Plaintiffs \nare not in legal compliance, is whether Defendants actually seek to take action against Plaintiffs.  \nBut it is not clear how waiting for Defendants to actually take action would “significantly \nadvance [the court’s] ability to deal with the legal issues presented.”  Texas, 497 F.3d at 498–99.  \nAs previously stated, Defendants’ Guidelines clash with Plaintiffs’ state laws and policies in \nrelation to public school facilities and Plaintiffs have called into question the legality of those \nGuidelines.  Mot. Injunction 9–12, ECF No. 11.  Therefore, “further factual development would \nnot ‘significantly advance the courts ability to deal with the legal issues presented.’”  Texas, 497 \nF.3d at 498−99.  Accordingly, the Court finds that this case is ripe for review.  \n3.  Final Agency Action under the APA  \n                                                           \n12 The Court further addresses this issue in section III.A.3. \n15 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 16 of 38   PageID 1026\n  The Court now evaluates whether the Guidelines are final agency action meeting the \njurisdictional threshold under the APA.  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5.  Defendants argue that \nthere has been no final agency action as the documents in question are merely “paradigmatic \ninterpretive rules, exempt from the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.”  Defs.’ Resp. \n18, ECF No. 40.  Defendants also allege that the Guidelines are “[v]alid interpretations of the \nstatutory and regulatory authorities on which they are premised” because although Title IX and \n§ 106.33 provide that federal recipients may provide for separate, comparable facilities, the \nregulation and statute “do not address how they apply when a transgender student seeks to use \nthose facilities . . . .”  Id. at 20−21.  \n  Plaintiffs allege that the agencies’ Guidelines are binding nationwide and the Defendants’ \nenforcement patterns in various states clearly demonstrate that legal actions against those that do \nnot comply will follow.  Mot. Injunction 9–12, ECF No. 11; Reply 2–8, ECF No. 52.  Plaintiffs \nidentify a number of similar cases where Defendants have investigated schools that refused to \ncomply with the new Guidelines and where they sued North Carolina over its state law which, in \npart, made it legal to require a person to use the public restroom according to their biological sex.  \nReply 6, ECF No. 52.  \n  An administrative action is “final agency action” under the APA if: (1) the agency’s \naction is the “consummation of the agency’s decision making process;” and (2) “the action [is] \none by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences \nwill flow.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78.  “In evaluating whether a challenged agency action \nmeets these two conditions, the court is guided by the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the \nAPA’s finality requirement as ‘flexible’ and ‘pragmatic.’”  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5 \n(quoting Qureshi v. Holder, 663 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir. 2011)). \n16 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 17 of 38   PageID 1027\n  The Court finds that the Guidelines are final agency action under the APA.  Defendants \ndo not dispute that the Guidelines are a “consummation” of the agencies’ decision-making \nprocess.  Hr’g Tr. 61; Nat’l Pork Producers Council v. E.P.A., 635 F.3d 738, 755–56 (5th Cir. \n2011) (citing Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 912 F.2d 1525, \n1532 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (deciding that EPA guidance letters constitute final agency actions as they \n“serve[d] to confirm a definitive position that has a direct and immediate impact on the parties . . \n. .”)).  \n  The second consideration is also satisfied in this case because legal consequences flow \nfrom  the  Defendants’  actions.    Defendants  argue  no  legal  consequences  flow  to  Plaintiffs \nbecause there has been no enforcement action, or threat of enforcement action.  Hr’g Tr. 71.  The \nFifth Circuit held in EEOC however that “an agency action can create legal consequences even \nwhen the action, in itself, is disassociated with the filing of an enforcement proceeding, and is \nnot authority for the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.”  2016 WL 3524242  at *8.  \nAccording  to  the  Fifth  Circuit,  “‘legal  consequences’  are  created  whenever  the  challenged \nagency action has the effect of committing the agency itself to a view of the law that, in turn, \nforces the plaintiff either to alter its conduct, or expose itself to potential liability.”  Id.

Ct. 1807, 1814–15 (May 31, 2016) (holding \nthat using the pragmatic approach, an agency action asserting that plaintiff’s land was subject to \nthe  Clean  Water  Act’s  permitting  process  was  a  final  agency  action  which  carried  legal \nconsequences).  The Fifth Circuit concluded that “[i]t is also sufficient that the Enforcement \nGuidance [at issue in EEOC] has the immediate effect of altering the rights and obligations of the \n‘regulated community’ (i.e. virtually all state and private employers) by offering them a detailed \nand conclusive means to avoid an adverse EEOC finding . . . .”  2016 WL 3524242 at * 6.   \n17 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 18 of 38   PageID 1028\n  In this case, although the Guidelines provide no safe harbor provision, the DOJ/DOE \nLetter provides not only must Plaintiffs permit individuals to use the restrooms, locker rooms, \nshowers, and housing consistent with their gender identity, but that they find no safe harbor in \nproviding  transgender  students  individual-user  facilities  as  an  alternative  accommodation.  \nIndeed, the Guidelines provide that schools may, consistent with Title IX, make individual-user \nfacilitates available for other students who “voluntarily seek additional privacy.”  See DOJ/DOE \nLetter  3,  ECF  No.  6-10.    Using  a  pragmatic  and  common  sense  approach,  Defendants’ \nGuidelines and actions indicate that Plaintiffs jeopardize their federal education funding by \nchoosing  not  to  comply  with  Defendants’  Guidelines.13    EEOC,  2016  WL  3524242  at  *8 \n(“Instead, ‘legal consequences’ are created whenever the challenged agency action has the effect \nof committing the agency itself to a view of the law that, in turn, forces the plaintiff either to \nalter its conduct, or expose itself to potential liability.”); Resident Council of Allen Parkway Vill. \nv.

E.E.O.C, 27 F.3d 973, 975–\n76 (D.C.

Other guidance from Defendants take \nsimilar actions.  See also DOJ/DOE Letter 4–5, ECF No. 6-10.  \n18 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 19 of 38   PageID 1029\nmanual simply expressed the agency’s view with respect to employers’ actions and compliance \nwith Title VII). \n  Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants’ Guidelines are final agency action such \nthat the jurisdictional threshold is met.  EEOC, 2016 WL 3524242 at *5. \n4.  Alternative Legal Remedy \n  Defendants also contend that district court review is precluded and Plaintiffs should not \nbe allowed to avoid the administrative process by utilizing the APA at this time.  Defs.’ Resp. \n16, ECF No. 40.  Defendants allege that “review by a court of appeals is an ‘adequate remedy’ \nwithin the meaning of the APA,” and “[s]ection 704 of the APA thus prevents plaintiffs from \ncircumventing the administrative and judicial process Congress provided them.”  Id.  Defendants \nargue “Congress has precluded district court jurisdiction over pre-enforcement actions like this.”  \nId. at 17.  Defendants cite several cases, including the Supreme Court’s opinions in Thunder \nBasin v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994) and Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 132 S.Ct. 2126 \n(2012), in support of this argument.14   \n  Defendants’ assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ APA claims fails \nand their reliance on Thunder Basin, Elgin, and the other cited cases is misplaced.  In Thunder \nBasin, the Supreme Court held that the Mine Act’s statutory review scheme precluded the district \n                                                           \n14 Defendants also assert NAACP v. Meese supports this argument but the Court disagrees.  In that case, \nthe plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Attorney General from reopening or agreeing to reopen any consent \ndecree in any civil rights action pending in any other court.  The district court denied this request, holding \nsuch actions would violate principles of separation of powers and comity.  615 F. Supp. 200, 201–02 \n(D.D.C. 1985) (“Plaintiffs’ action must fail (1) under the principle of the separation of powers, and (2) \nbecause this Court lacks authority to interfere with or to seek to guide litigation in other district courts \nthroughout the United States.”).  The Meese court also concluded there was no final agency action to \nenjoin and, by definition, there would be an alternative legal remedy related to those cases where a \nconsent decree existed because those decrees were already subject to a presiding judge.  Id. at 203 n.9.  \nAdditionally, Defendants reliance on Dist. Adult Prob. Dep’t v. Dole, 948 F.2d 953 (5th Cir. 1991) does \nnot apply because there was no final agency action in that case. \n19 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 20 of 38   PageID 1030\ncourt  from  exercising  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  a  pre-enforcement  challenge.    To \ndetermine whether pre-enforcement challenges are prohibited courts look to whether this “intent \nis ‘fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.’”  Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207 (quoting Block v. \nCommunity  Nutrition  Institute,  467  U.S.  340,  351  (1984)).    The  Supreme  Court  held  that \n“[w]hether a statute is intended to preclude initial judicial review is determined from the statute’s \nlanguage, structure, and purpose, its legislative history . . . and whether the claims can be \nafforded meaningful review.”  Id. (internal citation omitted).   \n  Although the Mine Act was silent about pre-enforcement claims, the Supreme Court held \nthat “its comprehensive enforcement structure demonstrate[d] that Congress intended to preclude \nchallenges,” and the Mine Act “expressly authorize[d] district court jurisdiction in only two \nprovisions . . . [which allowed] the Secretary [of Labor] to enjoin [] violations of health and \nsafety standards and to coerce payment of civil penalties.”  Id. at 209.  Thus, plaintiffs had to \n“complain to the Commission and then to the court of appeals.”  Id. (italics omitted).  \n  Elgin reached a similar conclusion, holding that the Civil Service Reform Act (“CSRA”) \nwas  the  exclusive  avenue  to  judicial  review  for  petitioners’  claims  against  the  Treasury \nDepartment.    132 S. Ct.  2126, 2128 (“Just  as the CSRA’s ‘elaborate’ framework  [citation \nomitted] demonstrates Congress’ intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to \nwhom the CSRA denies statutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory review is not \navailable to those employees to whom the CSRA grants administrative and judicial review.”).    \n  No similar elaborate statutory framework exists covering Plaintiffs’ claims.  Neither Title \nVII nor Title IX presents statutory schemes that would preclude Plaintiffs from bringing these \nclaims in federal district court.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that Title IX’s enforcement \nprovisions, codified at Title 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1683, does not provide the exclusive statutory \n20 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 21 of 38   PageID 1031\nremedy for violations.  See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979) (holding that Title \nIX did not preclude a private right of action for damages).  Given Defendants lack of authority to \nthe contrary, the presumption of reviewability for all agency actions applies.  EEOC, 2016 WL \n3524242  at  *11  (citing  Abbott  Labs.,  387  U.S.  at  140)  (“To  wholly  deny  judicial  review, \nhowever, would be to ignore the presumption of reviewability, and to disregard the Supreme \nCourt’s  instruction  that  courts  should  adopt  a  pragmatic  approach  for  the  purposes  of \ndetermining reviewability under the APA.”).   \n  Having concluded that Plaintiffs claims are properly subject to judicial review, the Court \nnext evaluates whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate.   \nB.  Preliminary Injunction  \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  The first consideration is whether Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the \nmerits for their claims.  Plaintiffs aver that they have shown a substantial likelihood that they \nwill prevail on the merits because Defendants have violated the APA by (1) circumventing the \nnotice and comment process and (2) by issuing final agency action that is contrary to law.  Mot. \nInjunction 12–16, ECF No. 11.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ new policies \nare not valid agency interpretations that should be granted deference because “[a]gencies do not \nreceive deference where a new interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation.”  Pls.’ Reply \n11, ECF No. 52 (citing Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 515 (1994)).   \n  Defendants contend that their actions do not violate the APA because the Guidelines are \ninterpretive rules and are therefore exempt from the notice and comment requirements.  Defs.’ \nResp. 12–18, ECF No. 40.  Defendants argue the Guidelines are exempt because they do not \ncarry the force of law, even though “the agencies’ interpretations of the law are entitled to some \n21 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 22 of 38   PageID 1032\ndeference.” Further, they argue because their interpretation is reasonable, this interpretation is \nentitled to deference.15  Defendants also assert they did not act contrary to law because the \nGuidelines are valid interpretations of Title IX as the statute and regulations “do not address how \n[the laws] apply when a transgender student seeks to use those facilities” or “how a school \nshould determine a transgender student’s sex when providing access to sex-segregated facilities.”  \nId.  at  20–21.    Thus,  according  to  Defendants,  this  situation  presents  an  ambiguity  in  the \nregulatory scheme and Defendants are allowed to provide guidelines to federal fund recipients on \nthis matter.  Id. at 21.16   \n  In their Reply, Plaintiffs counter that DOE’s implementing regulation, § 106.33, is not \n“ambiguous[,] [a]s a physiologically-grounded regulation, it covers every human being and \ntherefor all those within the reach of Title IX.”  Reply 8, ECF No. 52.  They contend further, \n“[t]o create legal room to undo what Congress (and preceding regulators) had done, Defendants \n                                                           \n15 Defendants argue the Court should be guided in this decision by the Fourth Circuit’s decision in G.G. \nex rel Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016) (“G.G.”).  Defendants contend the \nFourth Circuit’s majority opinion in G.G. should be followed as it provides the proper analysis.  The \nSupreme Court recalled the Fourth Circuit’s mandate and stayed the preliminary injunction entered by the \ndistrict court in that case.  See Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm, No. 16-A-52, 2016 WL \n4131636 at *1 (Aug. 3, 2016) (Breyer, J. concurring) (“In light of the facts that four Justices have voted to \ngrant the application referred to the Court by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, that we are currently in recess, and \nthat granting a stay will preserve the status quo (as of the time the Court of Appeals made its decision) \nuntil the Court considers the forthcoming petition for certiorari, I vote to grant the application as a \ncourtesy.”).  The Supreme Court takes such actions only on the rarest of occasions.  Bd. of Ed. of City \nSchool Dist. of City of New Rochelle v. Taylor, 82 S.Ct. 10, 10 (1961) (“On such an application, since the \nCourt of Appeals refused the stay ‘* * * this court requires an extraordinary showing, before it will grant \na stay of the decree below pending the application for a certiorari.”); Russo v. Byrne, 409 U.S. 1219, 1221 \n(1972) (“If the application presents frivolous questions it should be denied. If it tenders a ruling out of \nharmony with our prior decisions, or questions of transcending public importance, or issues which would \nlikely induce this Court to grant certiorari, the stay should be granted.”).  Because it is impossible to know \nthe precise issue (s) that prompted the Supreme Court to grant the stay, it is difficult to conclude that G.G. \nwould control the outcome here.  See New Motor Vehicle Bd. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 \n(1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (declaring it is very difficult to predict anticipated Supreme Court \ndecision).  Nevertheless, the Court has reviewed the opinion and considers the well-expressed views of \neach member of the panel in reaching the decision in this case.   \n16 Defendants characterize their Guidelines as, “supply[ing] ‘crisper and more detailed lines’ than the \nstatutes and regulations that they interpret,” without “alter[ing] the legal obligations of regulated entities.”  \nId. at 20 (citing Am. Mining Cong. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1112 (D.C.

Plaintiffs continue, “[i]n enacting Title IX, Congress was concerned that women \nreceive  the  same  opportunities  as  men,  [t]hus,  Congress  utilized  ‘sex’  in  an  exclusively \nbiological context[,] [and] “[t]he two sexes are not fungible.”  Id. at 8–9 (quoting Ballard v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946).  It is the biological differences between men and \nwomen, Plaintiffs allege, that led Congress in 1972 to “permit differential treatment by sex \nonly[,]” provide a basis for DOE “to approve ‘separate toilet, locker rooms, and shower facilities \non the basis of sex” in § 106.33, and led the Supreme Court “to conclude that educational \ninstitutions must ‘afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex.’”  Id. at 9 (quoting 118 \nCong. Rec. 5807 (1972)); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S., 550 n.19 (1996)).   \n  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits because: \n(1) Defendants bypassed the notice and comment process required by the APA; (2) Title IX and \n§ 106.33’s text is not ambiguous; and (3) Defendants are not entitled to agency deference under \nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997).17   \ni.  Notice and Comment under the APA  \nDefendants state that “[t]he APA does not require agencies to follow notice and comment \nprocedures  in  all  situations  [,  and  the  APA]  specifically  excludes  interpretive  rules  and \nstatements  of  agency  policy  from  these  procedures.”    Defs.’  Resp.  17–18,  ECF  No.  40.  \nDefendants allege “[t]he guidance documents are . . . paradigmatic interpretive rules, exempt \nfrom the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.”  Id. at 18.  According to Defendants, \n                                                           \n17 Defendants’ counsel stated at the hearing that Defendants would not be entitled to Chevron deference \nfor the Guidelines.  See Hr’g Tr. 72.  Thus, the Court addresses only Defendants’ claim that they are \nentitled to Auer deference when interpreting § 106.33.  \n23 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 24 of 38   PageID 1034\n“the interpretations themselves do not carry the force of law . . . .”  Id. at 19.  Defendants rely on \nG.G., 822 F.3d 709, 720 (4th Cir. 2016) to support their claim that DOE’s “interpretation of the \nsingle-sex facility regulation implementing Title IX is reasonable, and does not conflict with \nthose regulations in any way.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants’ rules are legislative because: “(1) they grant rights \nwhile  also  imposing  significant  obligations;  (2)  they  amend  prior  legislative  rules  or \nlongstanding agency practice; and (3) bind the agencies and regulated entities,” requiring them to \ngo through the notice and comment process.  Mot. Injunction 12, ECF No. 11.  \nThe APA requires agency rules to be published in the Federal Register and that the public \nbe given an opportunity to comment on them.  5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) −(c).  This is referred to as the \nnotice and comment requirement.  The purpose is to permit the agency to understand and perhaps \nadjust  its  rules  based  on  the  comments  of  affected  individuals.    Prof'ls  and  Patients  for \nCustomized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir.1995).  However, not every action an \nagency takes is required to go through the notice and comment process.  “The APA divides \nagency action, as relevant here, into three boxes: legislative rules, interpretive rules, and general \nstatements of policy.”  Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  \n“Legislative rules  generally  require notice and  comment,  but  interpretive rules and  general \nstatements of policy do not.”  Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553).  “In order for a regulation to have the \n‘force and effect of law,’ it must have certain substantive characteristics and be the product of \ncertain procedural requisites.”  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301–03, (1979).    \nThe APA does not define a legislative or “substantive” rule, but in Morton v. Ruiz, 415 \nU.S. 199, 234 (1974), the Supreme Court held that a substantive rule or “a legislative-type rule,” \nis one that “affect[s] individual rights and obligations.”  Id. at 232.  The Supreme Court also \n24 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 25 of 38   PageID 1035\nheld, “the promulgation of these regulations must conform with any procedural requirements \nimposed by Congress.”  Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. at 303.  Thus, agency discretion is limited not \nonly by substantive, statutory grants of authority, but also by the procedural requirements which \n“assure fairness and mature consideration of rules of general application.”  Id. (quoting NLRB v. \nWyman-Gordon  Co.,  394  U.S.  759  (1969)).    If  a  rule  is  substantive,  notice  and  comment \nrequirements must be adhered to scrupulously.  Prof’ls and Patients for Customized Care, 56 \nF.3d at 595.  \n“[L]egislative rules (and sometimes interpretive rules) may be subject to pre-enforcement \nreview” because they subject a party to a binding obligation which can be the subject of an \nenforcement action.  McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 251. (“An agency action that purports to impose \nlegally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated parties—and that would be the basis for \nan enforcement action for violations of those obligations or requirements—is a legislative rule . . \n. .”).  The APA treats interpretive rules and general statements of policy differently.  Id.  (“As to \ninterpretive rules, an agency action that merely interprets a prior statute or regulation, and does \nnot itself purport to impose new obligations or prohibitions or requirements on regulated parties, \nis an interpretive rule.”).18   \nCourts have focused on several factors to evaluate whether rules are interpretative or \nlegislative.  Courts analyze the agency’s characterization of the guidance and post-guidance \nevents to determine whether the agency has applied the guidance as if it were binding on \nregulated  parties.    McCarthy,  758  F.3d  at  252−53.    However,  “the  most  important  factor \nconcerns the actual legal effect (or lack thereof) of the agency action in question on regulated \n                                                           \n18 Catawba Cty. provides: “An agency action that merely explains how the agency will enforce a statute \nor regulation—in other words,  how it will exercise  its  broad  enforcement discretion or permitting \ndiscretion under some extant statute or rule—is a general statement of policy.”) \n25 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 26 of 38   PageID 1036\nentities.”  McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252 (quoting Catawba Cty. v. EPA, 571 F.3d 20, 33–34; Gen. \nElec. Co. v. EPA, 290 F.3d 377, 382 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).  “A touchstone of a substantive rule is \nthat it establishes a binding norm.”  Prof’ls and Patients for Customized Care, 56 F.3d at 596; \nsee  also  Texas  v.  United  States,  809  F.3d  134,  202  (5th  Cir.  2015)  (King,  J.,  dissenting) \n(declaring that an agency action establishing binding norms which permit no discretion is a \nsubstantive rule requiring notice and comment).  If agency action “draws a ‘line in the sand’ that, \nonce crossed, removes all discretion from the agency” the rule is substantive.  Id. at 601.  \nHere, the Court finds that Defendants rules are legislative and substantive.  Although \nDefendants have characterized the Guidelines as interpretive, post-guidance events and their \nactual legal effect prove that they are “compulsory in nature.”  See Appalachian Power Co. v. \nEPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000);19 see also Prof’ls and Patients for Customized Care, \n56 F.3d at  596 (the label  an agency places on its exercise of administrative power is  not \nconclusive, rather it is what the agency does with that policy that determines the type of action).  \nDefendants confirmed at the hearing that schools not acting in conformity with Defendants’ \nGuidelines are not in compliance with Title IX.  Hr’g Tr. 71.  Further, post-Guidelines events, \nwhere Defendants have moved to enforce the Guidelines as binding, buttress this conclusion.  Id. \nat 7; Mot. Injunction 15–16, ECF No. 11; Reply 4–8, ECF No. 52.  The information before the \nCourt demonstrates Defendants have “drawn a line in the sand” in that they have concluded \nPlaintiffs must abide by the Guidelines, without exception, or they are in breach of their Title IX \nobligations.  Thus, it would follow that the “actual legal effect” of the Guidelines is to force \n                                                           \n19 In Appalachian Power, the D.C. Circuit held that an EPA guidance was a legislative rule despite the \nguidance document’s statement that it was advisory.  The Court analyzed the document as a whole and \nfound that “the entire Guidance, from beginning to end—except the last paragraph—reads like a ukase. It \ncommands, it requires, it orders, it dictates.”  208 F.3d at 1022-23.  Similarly, the DOJ/DOE Letter uses \nthe words “must,” and various forms of the word “require” numerous times throughout the document.  \nAm. Compl. Ex.

McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252; Catawba Cty., \n571 F.3d at 33–34; Gen. Elec. Co., 290 F.3d at 382; see also Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. \nNorton, 415 F.3d 8, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs, therefore, are legally affected in a way they \nwere not before Defendants issued the Guidelines.  The Guidelines are, in practice, legislative \nrules—not  just  interpretations  or  policy  statements  because  they  set  clear  legal  standards.  \nPanhandle Producers and Royalty Owners Ass’n v. Econ. Regulatory Admin, 847 F.2d 1168, \n1174 (5th Cir. 1988) (stating that a substantive rule is one that establishes standards of conduct \nthat carry the force of law).  As such, Defendants should have complied with the APA’s notice \nand comment requirement.  5 U.S.C. § 553; Nat’l Min. Ass’n, 758 F.3d at 251; Chrysler Corp., \n441 U.S. at 301–03.  Permitting the definition of sex to be defined in this way would allow \nDefendants to “create de facto new regulation” by agency action without complying with the \nproper procedures.  Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 586−88 (2000).  This is not \npermitted.   \nAccordingly  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  would  likely  succeed  on  the  merits  that \nDefendants violated the notice and comment requirements of the APA.  \nii.  Agency  Action  Contrary  to  Contrary  to  Law  (5  U.S.C. \n§ 553)  \n  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ Guidelines are contrary to the statutory and regulatory \ntext, Congressional intent, and the plain meaning of the term.  Mot. Injunction 14, ECF No. 11.  \nWhen an agency acts contrary to law, its action must be set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants’ interpretation of the meaning of the term “sex” as set out in the \nGuidelines contradicts its meaning in Title VII, Title IX, and § 106.33.  They assert “the meaning \nof the terms ‘sex,’ on the one hand, and ‘gender identity,’ on the other, both now and at the time \n27 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 28 of 38   PageID 1038\nTitles VII and IX were enacted, forecloses alternate constructions.”  Mot. Injunction 16, ECF \nNo. 11 (citing Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.S. at 512.  They also allege that the ordinary \nmeaning of the term controls.  Id. at 17 (citing Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, \n187 (1995)).   \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs’ arguments for legislative history and intent at the time \nof passage are irrelevant.  Hr’g Tr. 33 (“But it may very well be that Congress did not intend the \nlaw to protect transgender individuals. [But,] . . . as the Supreme Court has made it absolutely \nclear in Oncale, the fact that Congress may have understood the term sex to mean anatomical sex \nat birth is largely irrelevant.”)  Defendants also allege that “Title IX and Title VII should be \nconstrued broadly” to protect any person, including transgendered persons, from discrimination.  \nHr’g Tr. 33–34.   \nThe starting point to analyze this dispute begins with the actual text of the statute or \nregulation, where the words should be given their ordinary meaning.  Desert Palace, Inc. v. \nCosta, 539 U.S. 90, 98 (2003) (quoting Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253–\n54 (1992)).  When the words are unambiguous, the “judicial inquiry is complete.”  Id. (quoting \nRubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981)).  The pertinent statutory text at issue in this \ncase provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1681.  Title IX \nexpressly permits educational institutions to maintain separate living facilities for the different \nsexes.  Id. at § 1686.  The other language at issue comes from one of the DOE regulations \npromulgated to implement Title IX, which states: “A recipient may provide separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of \n28 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 29 of 38   PageID 1039\none sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. \nDefendants  assert  the  Guidelines  simply  provide  clarity  to  an  ambiguity  in  this \nregulation, and that ambiguity is how to define the term sex when dealing with transgendered \nstudents.  Defs.’ Resp. 20, ECF No. 40.  Because they contend the regulation is ambiguous, \nDefendants argue “[f]oundational principles of administrative law instruct [the Court] to give \ncontrolling weight to [their] interpretations of their own ambiguous regulations unless [they are] \nplainly erroneous.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs  contend  the  text  of  both  Title  VII  and  Title  IX  is  not  ambiguous.    Mot. \nInjunction 16–19, ECF No. 11.  They argue when Congress passed both statutes it clearly \nintended sex to be defined based on the biological and anatomical differences between males and \nfemales.  See id. at 17–18 (citing legislative history and common understanding of its meaning at \nthe time of passage).  Plaintiffs likewise assert § 106.33 is unambiguous, for the same reason, as \nit was designed to separate students based on their biological differences because they have a \nprivacy right to avoid exhibiting their “nude or partially nude body, genitalia, and other private \nparts” before members of the opposite sex.  Pls.’ Reply 8–9, ECF No. 52.  Based on this, they \nargue Defendants have manufactured an ambiguity so they can then unilaterally change the law \nto suit their policy preferences.  Id. at 8. \niii.  Auer Deference \nBecause  Defendants  assert  their  regulation  is  ambiguous,  the  Court  must  determine \nwhether their interpretation is entitled to deference.  Defendants contend an agency may interpret \nits  own  regulation  by  issuing  an  opinion  letter  or  other  guidance  which  should  be  given \ncontrolling weight if: (1) the regulation is ambiguous; and (2) the interpretation is not plainly \n29 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 30 of 38   PageID 1040\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.  Defs.’ Resp. 21, ECF No. 40; Christensen, 529 \nU.S.  at  588  (“Auer  deference  is  warranted  only  when  the  language  of  the  regulation  is \nambiguous.”); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (“[An agency’s] interpretation of [its \nregulation] is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with \nthe regulation.’”) (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989)).   \nThis  deference  is  only  warranted  however  when  the  language  of  the  regulation  is \nambiguous.    Moore  v.  Hannon  Food  Services,  Inc.,  317  F.3d  489,  495  (5th  Cir.  2003).  \nLegislation is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one accepted meaning.  Calix v. Lynch, \n784 F.3d 1000, 1005 (5th Cir. 2015).  “Multiple accepted meanings do not exist merely because \na statute’s ‘authors did not have the forethought expressly to contradict any creative contortion \nthat may later be constructed to expand or prune its scope.’”  Id. (citing Moore, 317 F.3d at 497 \nand applying this rule of construction to regulations).   \nIf a regulation is not ambiguous, the agency’s interpretation may be considered but only \naccording to its persuasive power.  Moore, 317 F.3d at 495.  “Thus, a court must determine \nwhether ‘all but one of the meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.’”  Calix, 784 F.3d at \n1005 (quoting Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132–33 (1993)).  When a term is not defined, \ncourts may generally give the words their common and ordinary meaning in accordance with \nlegislative intent.  D.C. Bd. of Elections & Ethics v. D.C., 866 A.2d 788, 798 n.18 (D.C. 2005) \n(“In finding the ordinary meaning, ‘the use of dictionary definitions is appropriate in interpreting \nundefined statutory terms.’”); 1618 Twenty–First St. Tenants Ass’n, Inc. v. Phillips Collection, \n829 A.2d 201, 203 (D.C. 2003) (same).  Furthermore, “an agency is not entitled to deference \nwhen  it  offers  up  an  interpretation  of  [a  regulation]  that  [courts]  have  already  said  to  be \n30 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 31 of 38   PageID 1041\nunambiguously foreclosed by the regulatory text.”  Exelon Wind 1, L.L.C. v. Nelson, 766 F.3d \n380, 399 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Christensen, 529 U.S. at 588).  \nBased on the foregoing authority, the Court concludes § 106.33 is not ambiguous.  It \ncannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106.33 when it was \nenacted by DOE following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences \nbetween male and female students as determined at their birth.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.33; 45 Fed. \nReg.  30955  (May  9,  1980);  Thomas  Jefferson  Univ.,  512  U.S.  at  512  (holding  that  intent \ndetermined at the time the regulations are promulgated).  It appears Defendants at least tacitly \nagree this distinction was the intent of the drafter.  See Holder Memo 1, ECF No. 6-3 (“The \nfederal government’s approach to this issue has also evolved over time.”); see also Hr’g Tr. 33 \n(“[I]t may very well be that Congress did not intend the law to protect transgender individuals.”).   \nAdditionally, it cannot reasonably be disputed that DOE complied with Congressional \nintent when drawing the distinctions in § 106.33 based on the biological differences between \nmale and female students.  Pls.’ Mot. Injunction 17–18, ECF No. 11 (citing legislative history \nand common understanding of its meaning at the time of passage).  As the support identified by \nPlaintiffs shows, this was the common understanding of the term when Title IX was enacted, and \nremained  the  understanding  during  the  regulatory  process  that  led  to  the  promulgation  of \n§ 106.33.  See Pls.’ Am. Compl. ¶¶ 8–13, ECF No. 6; see also G.G., 822 F.3d at 736 (Niemeyer, \nJ.,  dissenting)  (providing  comprehensive  list  of  various  definitions  from  the  1970s  which \ndemonstrated “during that time period, virtually every dictionary definition of ‘sex’ referred to \nthe physiological distinctions between males and females, particularly with  respect  to  their \nreproductive functions.”).  This undoubtedly was permitted because the areas identified by the \nregulations are places where male and female students may have to expose their “nude or \n31 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 32 of 38   PageID 1042\npartially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts,” and separation from members of the \nopposite sex, those whose bodies possessed a different anatomical structure, was needed to \nensure personal privacy.  See G.G., 822 F.3d at 723.   \nThis conclusion is also supported by the text and structure of the regulations.  Section \n106.33 specifically permits educational institutions to provide separate toilets, locker rooms, and \nshowers  based  on  sex,  provided  that  the  separate  facilities  are  comparable.    The  sections \nimmediately  preceding  and  following  §  106.33  likewise  permit  educational  institutions  to \nseparate students on the basis of sex.  For instance, § 106.32 permits educational institutions to \nprovide separate housing for students on the basis of sex, again so long as the separate housing is \ncomparable, and § 106.33 permits separate educational sessions for boys and girls when dealing \nwith instruction concerning human sexuality.  34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32, 106.34.  Without question, \npermitting educational institutions to provide separate housing to male and female students, and \nseparate educational instruction concerning human sexuality, was to protect students’ personal \nprivacy, or discussion of their personal privacy, while in the presence of members of the opposite \nbiological sex.  G.G., 822 F.3d at 723.  Accordingly, this interpretation of § 106.33 is consistent \nwith the structure and purpose of the regulations.   \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes § 106.33 is not ambiguous.  Given this \nregulation is not ambiguous, Defendants’ definition is not entitled to Auer deference, meaning it \ndoes not receive controlling weight.  Auer, 519 U.S. at 461.  Instead, Defendants’ interpretation \nis entitled to respect, but only to the extent it has the power to persuade.  Christensen, 529 U.S. at \n587.  In his dissent in G.G., Judge Niemeyer characterized Defendants’ definition as “illogical \nand unworkable.”  G.G., 822 F.3d at 737.  He outlined a number of scenarios, which need not be \nrepeated here, where the Defendants’ interpretation only causes more confusion for educational \n32 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 33 of 38   PageID 1043\ninstitutions.  Id.  A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive.  Additionally, \nsince this definition alters the definition the agency has used since its enactment, its persuasive \neffect is decreased.  See Morton, 415 U.S. at 237; see also Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham \nCorp., 132 S. Ct. 2156, 2168 (2012) (holding that an agency announcement of an interpretation \npreceded by a very lengthy period with no interpretation indicates agency considered prior \npractice lawful).  Accordingly, the Court concludes Defendants’ interpretation is insufficient to \novercome the regulation’s plain language and for the reasons stated above is contrary to law. \n2.  Threat of Irreparable Harm  \n  The Court next addresses irreparable harm.  Defendants allege that Plaintiffs have not \nidentified any pending or imminent enforcement action, and the Guidelines “expose [P]laintiffs \nto no new liability or legal requirements.”  Defs.’ Resp. 7, ECF No. 40 (citing Google v. Hood, \n822 F.3d 212, 227 (5th Cir. 2016).  Defendants argue that, “[a]lthough [P]laintiffs do identify a \nsmall  number  of  specific  ‘policies  and  practices’  that  they  claim  are  in  conflict  with \n[D]efendants’ interpretation of Title IX, they have identified no enforcement action being taken \nagainst them—now or in the future—as a result of these polices.”  Defs.’ Resp. 8–9, ECF No. 40.  \nThey assert that even if DOE were “to decide to bring an administrative enforcement action \nagainst plaintiffs for noncompliance . . . at some point in the future, [P]laintiffs still would be \nunable to make a showing of irreparable harm because they would have an opportunity to \nchallenge the interpretation in an administrative process prior to any loss of federal funds.”  Id. at \n9 (quoting Morgan v. Fletcher, 518 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1975)).  \n  Plaintiffs counter that “Defendants’ actions cause irreparable harm by forcing policy \nchanges,  imposing  drastic  financial  consequences,  and  usurping  [Plaintiffs’]  legitimate \nauthority.”  Mot. Injunction 21, ECF No. 11.  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants’ actions \n33 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 34 of 38   PageID 1044\npresent “a Hobson’s choice between violating federal rules (labeled as regulations, guidance, and \ninterpretations) on the one hand, and transgressing longstanding policies and practices, on the \nother.”    Id.    Thus,  Plaintiffs  characterize  Defendants’  administrative  letters  and  notices  as \n“mandates” which effectively carry the force of law.  Id.  Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants’ \nrules  are  “irreconcilable  with  countless  polices  regarding  restrooms,  showers,  and  intimate \nfacilities,”  while  threatening  to  override  the  practices  of  “countless  schools,”  which  had \npreviously  been  allowed  to  differentiate  intimate  facilities  on  the  basis  of  biological  sex \nconsistent with Title IX, federal regulations, and laws protecting privacy and dignity.  Id. (citing \nMot. Injunction, Ex. P. (Thweatt Dec.) 5–7, ECF No. 11-2).   \n  Defendants’  appear  to  concede  the  Guidelines  conflict  with  Plaintiffs’  policies  and \npractices, see Defs.’ Resp. 8–9; ECF No. 40 (“[P]laintiffs do identify a small number of specific \n‘policies and practices’ . . . .”); however, they argue that additional threats of enforcement are \nrequired before irreparable harm exists.  Case law does not support this contention.  Instead the \nauthorities hold, “any time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  See Coalition for Econ. \nEquity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 718, 719 (9th Cir. 1997) (stating, whenever an enactment of a state’s \npeople is enjoined, the state suffers irreparable injury); accord Planned Parenthood of Greater \nTex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013) (“When a statute is \nenjoined, the State necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the \nenforcement of its laws.”); Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. 1, 3 (2012) (citing New Motor Vehicle \nBd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) \n(“[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives \nof its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”).   \n34 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 35 of 38   PageID 1045\n  As  Defendants  have  conceded  the  conflict  between  the  Guidelines  and  Plaintiffs’ \npolicies, and Plaintiffs have identified a number of statutes that conflict, the Court concludes \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated a threat of irreparable harm.20 \n3.  Balance of Hardships and Public Interest21 \n  The  Court  next  considers  whether  the  threatened  injury  to  the  Plaintiffs  outweighs \nwhatever damage the proposed injunction may cause Defendants and its impact on the public \ninterest.  Nichols, 532 F.3d at 372.  Plaintiffs risk either running afoul of Defendants’ Guidelines \nor complying and violating various state statutes and, in some cases, their state constitutions.  \nMot. Injunction 21, ECF No. 11.  Plaintiffs also state that they likely risk legal action from \nparents,  students,  and  other  members  of  their  respective  communities  should  they  actually \ncomply  with  Defendants’  Guidelines.    Defendants  argue  these  harms  do  not  outweigh  the \ndamage that granting the injunction will cause because it will impede their ability to eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  the  workplace  and  educational  settings,  prevent  them  from  definitively \nexplaining to the public the rights and obligations under these statutes, and it would have a \ndeleterious effect on the transgendered.   \n  The Court concludes Plaintiffs have established that the failure to grant an injunction will \nplace them in the position of either maintaining their current policies in the face of the federal \ngovernment’s  view  that  they  are  violating  the  law,  or  changing  them  to  comply  with  the \nGuidelines and cede their authority over this issue.  See DOJ/DOE Letter, ECF No. 6-10 (“This \nletter summarizes a school’s Title IX obligations regarding transgender students and explains \n                                                           \n20 Defendants also contend the injunction should be denied because Plaintiffs delayed in seeking this \nrelief.  The DOJ/DOE Letter is dated May 13, 2016.  This case was filed very soon after on May 25, \n2016, and the parties reached an agreement on a briefing schedule to consider this request.  The Court \nconcludes Plaintiffs did not fail to act timely.   \n21 The Parties address the third and fourth Canal factors together, therefore they are treated together in this \nOrder as well. \n35 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 36 of 38   PageID 1046\nhow [DOE and DOJ] evaluate a school’s compliance with these obligations.”).  Plaintiffs’ harms \nin this regard outweigh those identified by Defendants, particularly since the Supreme Court \nstayed the Fourth Circuit’s decision supporting Defendants’ position, and a decision from the \nSupreme Court in the near future may obviate the issues in this lawsuit.  As a result, Plaintiffs \ninterests  outweigh  those  identified  by  Defendants.    Further,  Defendants  have  not  offered \nevidence that Plaintiffs are not accommodating students who request an alternative arrangement.  \nIndeed, the school district at issue in G.G. provided its student an accommodation.   \n  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden and these factors weigh \nin favor of granting the preliminary injunction. \nC.  Scope of the Injunction  \n  Finally, the Court must determine the scope of the injunction.  Plaintiffs seek to apply the \ninjunction nationwide.  Mot. Injunction 3, ECF No. 11; Pls.’ Reply 13, ECF No. 52.  Defendants \ncounter that the injunction should be narrowly tailored to Plaintiffs in the Fifth Circuit.  Defs.’ \nResp. 28, ECF No. 40.   \n  “Absent the clearest command to the contrary from Congress, federal courts retain their \nequitable power to issue injunctions in suits over which they have jurisdiction.”  Califano v. \nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 705 (1979).  “[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent \nof the violation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.”  Id. at 702 \n(permitting a nationwide injunction because the class action was proper and finding that a \nnationwide  injunction  was  not  more  burdensome  than  necessary  to  redress  plaintiffs’ \ncomplaints).   \n  The Court concludes this injunction should apply nationwide.  As the separate facilities \nprovision in § 106.33 is permissive, states that authorize schools to define sex to include gender \n36 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 37 of 38   PageID 1047\nidentity for purposes of providing separate restroom, locker room, showers, and other intimate \nfacilities will not be impacted by it.  Those states who do not want to be covered by this \ninjunction can easily avoid doing so by state law that recognizes the permissive nature § 106.33.  \nIt therefore only applies to those states whose laws direct separation.  However, an injunction \nshould not unnecessarily interfere with litigation currently pending before other federal courts on \nthis subject regardless of the state law.  As such, the parties should file a pleading describing \nthose cases so the Court can appropriately narrow the scope if appropriate.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ application for a preliminary \ninjunction (ECF No. 11) should be and is hereby GRANTED.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  It is \nFURTHER ORDERED that bond is set in the amount of one hundred dollars.22  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(c).  Defendants are enjoined from enforcing the Guidelines against Plaintiffs and their \nrespective schools, school boards, and other public, educationally-based institutions.  Further, \nwhile this injunction remains in place, Defendants are enjoined from initiating, continuing, or \nconcluding  any  investigation  based  on  Defendants’  interpretation  that  the  definition  of  sex \nincludes gender identity in Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex.  \nAdditionally, Defendants are enjoined from using the Guidelines or asserting the Guidelines \ncarry weight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order.  All parties to this cause \nof  action  must  maintain  the  status  quo  as  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  this  Order  and  this \npreliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Court rules on the merits of this claim, or \nuntil further direction from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  This preliminary injunction shall \nbe binding on Defendants and any officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, or other \n                                                           \n22 Neither party addressed the appropriate bond amount should an injunction be entered. \n37 \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 58   Filed 08/21/16    Page 38 of 38   PageID 1048\npersons in active concert or participation with Defendants, as provided in Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure Rule 65(d)(2). \n  SO ORDERED on this 21st day of August, 2016.    \n \n38 ",

In recent years, we have received an increasing number of questions from \nparents, teachers, principals, and school superintendents about civil rights protections for transgender \nstudents. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) and its implementing regulations \nprohibit sex discrimination in educational programs and activities operated by recipients of Federal \nfinancial assistance.1 This prohibition encompasses discrimination based on a student’s gender identity, \nincluding discrimination based on a student’s transgender status. This letter summarizes a school’s Title \nIX obligations regarding transgender students and explains how the U.S. Department of Education (ED) \nand the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) evaluate a school’s compliance with these obligations.  \nED and DOJ (the Departments) have determined that this letter is significant guidance.2 This guidance \ndoes not add requirements to applicable law, but provides information and examples to inform \nrecipients about how the Departments evaluate whether covered entities are complying with their legal \nobligations. If you have questions or are interested in commenting on this guidance, please contact ED \nat ocr@ed.gov or 800-421-3481 (TDD 800-877-8339); or DOJ at education@usdoj.gov or 877-292-3804 \n(TTY: 800-514-0383). \nAccompanying this letter is a separate document from ED’s Office of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation, Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students. The \nexamples in that document are taken from policies that school districts, state education agencies, and \nhigh school athletics associations around the country have adopted to help ensure that transgender \nstudents enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment. Schools are encouraged to \nconsult that document for practical ways to meet Title IX’s requirements.3 \nTerminology  \n  Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of gender. A person’s gender identity may \nbe different from or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth. \n  Sex assigned at birth refers to the sex designation recorded on an infant’s birth certificate \nshould such a record be provided at birth. \n  Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they \nwere assigned at birth. A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned \nthe sex of female at birth; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was \nassigned the sex of male at birth. \n \n\nDear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students    Page 2 of 8 \n  Gender transition refers to the process in which transgender individuals begin asserting the sex \nthat corresponds to their gender identity instead of the sex they were assigned at birth. During \ngender transition, individuals begin to live and identify as the sex consistent with their gender \nidentity and may dress differently, adopt a new name, and use pronouns consistent with their \ngender identity. Transgender individuals may undergo gender transition at any stage of their \nlives, and gender transition can happen swiftly or over a long duration of time.  \nCompliance with Title IX \nAs a condition of receiving Federal funds, a school agrees that it will not exclude, separate, deny benefits \nto, or otherwise treat differently on the basis of sex any person in its educational programs or activities \nunless expressly authorized to do so under Title IX or its implementing regulations.4 The Departments \ntreat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing \nregulations. This means that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it \ntreats other students of the same gender identity. The Departments’ interpretation is consistent with \ncourts’ and other agencies’ interpretations of Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination.5 \nThe Departments interpret Title IX to require that when a student or the student’s parent or guardian, \nas appropriate, notifies the school administration that the student will assert a gender identity that \ndiffers from previous representations or records, the school will begin treating the student consistent \n \nwith the student’s gender identity. Under Title IX, there is no medical diagnosis or treatment \nrequirement that students must meet as a prerequisite to being treated consistent with their gender \nidentity.6 Because transgender students often are unable to obtain identification documents that reflect \ntheir gender identity (e.g., due to restrictions imposed by state or local law in their place of birth or \nresidence),7 requiring students to produce such identification documents in order to treat them \nconsistent with their gender identity may violate Title IX when doing so has the practical effect of \nlimiting or denying students equal access to an educational program or activity.  \nA school’s Title IX obligation to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex requires schools to provide \ntransgender students equal access to educational programs and activities even in circumstances in \nwhich other students, parents, or community members raise objections or concerns. As is consistently \nrecognized in civil rights cases, the desire to accommodate others’ discomfort cannot justify a policy that \nsingles out and disadvantages a particular class of students.8  \n1.  Safe and Nondiscriminatory Environment \nSchools have a responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students, \nincluding transgender students. Harassment that targets a student based on gender identity, \ntransgender status, or gender transition is harassment based on sex, and the Departments enforce Title \nIX accordingly.9 If sex-based harassment creates a hostile environment, the school must take prompt \nand effective steps to end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its \neffects. A school’s failure to treat students consistent with their gender identity may create or \ncontribute to a hostile environment in violation of Title IX. For a more detailed discussion of Title IX \n \n\nDear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students    Page 3 of 8 \nrequirements related to sex-based harassment, see guidance documents from ED’s Office for Civil Rights \n(OCR) that are specific to this topic.10 \n2.  Identification Documents, Names, and Pronouns \nUnder Title IX, a school must treat students consistent with their gender identity even if their education \nrecords or identification documents indicate a different sex. The Departments have resolved Title IX \ninvestigations with agreements committing that school staff and contractors will use pronouns and \nnames consistent with a transgender student’s gender identity.11 \n3.  Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities \nTitle IX’s implementing regulations permit a school to provide sex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms, \nshower facilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well as single-sex classes under certain circumstances.12 \nWhen a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to \nparticipate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity.13 \n  Restrooms and Locker Rooms. A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but \nmust allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity.14 A \nschool may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender \nidentity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school \n \nmay, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek \nadditional privacy.15  \n  Athletics. Title IX regulations permit a school to operate or sponsor sex-segregated athletics teams \nwhen selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or when the activity involved is a \ncontact sport.16 A school may not, however, adopt or adhere to requirements that rely on overly \nbroad generalizations or stereotypes about the differences between transgender students and \nother students of the same sex (i.e., the same gender identity) or others’ discomfort with \ntransgender students.17 Title IX does not prohibit age-appropriate, tailored requirements based on \nsound, current, and research-based medical knowledge about the impact of the students’ \nparticipation on the competitive fairness or physical safety of the sport.18 \n  Single-Sex Classes. Although separating students by sex in classes and activities is generally \nprohibited, nonvocational elementary and secondary schools may offer nonvocational single-sex \nclasses and extracurricular activities under certain circumstances.19 When offering such classes \nand activities, a school must allow transgender students to participate consistent with their \ngender identity. \n  Single-Sex Schools. Title IX does not apply to the admissions policies of certain educational \ninstitutions, including nonvocational elementary and secondary schools, and private \nundergraduate colleges.20 Those schools are therefore permitted under Title IX to set their own \n \n\nDear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students    Page 4 of 8 \nsex-based admissions policies. Nothing in Title IX prohibits a private undergraduate women’s \ncollege from admitting transgender women if it so chooses.  \n  Social Fraternities and Sororities. Title IX does not apply to the membership practices of social \nfraternities and sororities.21 Those organizations are therefore permitted under Title IX to set their \nown policies regarding the sex, including gender identity, of their members. Nothing in Title IX \nprohibits a fraternity from admitting transgender men or a sorority from admitting transgender \nwomen if it so chooses. \n  Housing and Overnight Accommodations. Title IX allows a school to provide separate housing on \nthe basis of sex.22 But a school must allow transgender students to access housing consistent with \ntheir gender identity and may not require transgender students to stay in single-occupancy \naccommodations or to disclose personal information when not required of other students. \nNothing in Title IX prohibits a school from honoring a student’s voluntary request for single-\noccupancy accommodations if it so chooses.23 \n  Other Sex-Specific Activities and Rules. Unless expressly authorized by Title IX or its implementing \nregulations, a school may not segregate or otherwise distinguish students on the basis of their sex, \nincluding gender identity, in any school activities or the application of any school rule. Likewise, a \nschool may not discipline students or exclude them from participating in activities for appearing or \n \nbehaving in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity or that does not conform to \nstereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity (e.g., in yearbook photographs, at school dances, \nor at graduation ceremonies).24 \n4.  Privacy and Education Records \nProtecting transgender students’ privacy is critical to ensuring they are treated consistent with their \ngender identity. The Departments may find a Title IX violation when a school limits students’ educational \nrights or opportunities by failing to take reasonable steps to protect students’ privacy related to their \ntransgender status, including their birth name or sex assigned at birth.25 Nonconsensual disclosure of \npersonally identifiable information (PII), such as a student’s birth name or sex assigned at birth, could be \nharmful to or invade the privacy of transgender students and may also violate the Family Educational \nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA).26 A school may maintain records with this information, but such records \nshould be kept confidential. \n  Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from Education Records. FERPA generally \nprevents the nonconsensual disclosure of PII from a student’s education records; one exception is \nthat records may be disclosed to individual school personnel who have been determined to have a \nlegitimate educational interest in the information.27 Even when a student has disclosed the \nstudent’s transgender status to some members of the school community, schools may not rely on \nthis FERPA exception to disclose PII from education records to other school personnel who do not \nhave a legitimate educational interest in the information. Inappropriately disclosing (or requiring \nstudents or their parents to disclose) PII from education records to the school community may \n \n\nDear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students    Page 5 of 8 \nviolate FERPA and interfere with transgender students’ right under Title IX to be treated \nconsistent with their gender identity. \n  Disclosure of Directory Information. Under FERPA’s implementing regulations, a school may \ndisclose appropriately designated directory information from a student’s education record if \ndisclosure would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy.28 Directory \ninformation may include a student’s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, \nhonors and awards, and dates of attendance.29 School officials may not designate students’ sex, \nincluding transgender status, as directory information because doing so could be harmful or an \ninvasion of privacy.30 A school also must allow eligible students (i.e., students who have reached \n18 years of age or are attending a postsecondary institution) or parents, as appropriate, a \nreasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose a student’s directory \ninformation.31  \n  Amendment or Correction of Education Records. A school may receive requests to correct a \nstudent’s education records to make them consistent with the student’s gender identity. Updating \na transgender student’s education records to reflect the student’s gender identity and new name \nwill help protect privacy and ensure personnel consistently use appropriate names and pronouns. \no  Under FERPA, a school must consider the request of an eligible student or parent to amend \n \ninformation in the student’s education records that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of \nthe student’s privacy rights.32 If the school does not amend the record, it must inform the \nrequestor of its decision and of the right to a hearing. If, after the hearing, the school does not \namend the record, it must inform the requestor of the right to insert a statement in the record \nwith the requestor’s comments on the contested information, a statement that the requestor \ndisagrees with the hearing decision, or both. That statement must be disclosed whenever the \nrecord to which the statement relates is disclosed.33   \no  Under Title IX, a school must respond to a request to amend information related to a student’s \ntransgender status consistent with its general practices for amending other students’ records.34 \nIf a student or parent complains about the school’s handling of such a request, the school must \npromptly and equitably resolve the complaint under the school’s Title IX grievance procedures.35  \n* * * \nWe appreciate the work that many schools, state agencies, and other organizations have undertaken to \nmake educational programs and activities welcoming, safe, and inclusive for all students. \nSincerely, \n/s/  /s/ \nCatherine E.

Nothing in Title IX prohibits schools from offering coeducational athletic opportunities. \n17 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(b), (c). An interscholastic athletic association is subject to Title IX if (1) the association receives \nFederal financial assistance or (2) its members are recipients of Federal financial assistance and have ceded \ncontrolling authority over portions of their athletic program to the association. Where an athletic association is \ncovered by Title IX, a school’s obligations regarding transgender athletes apply with equal force to the association. \n18 The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), for example, reported that in developing its policy for \nparticipation by transgender students in college athletics, it consulted with medical experts, athletics officials, \naffected students, and a consensus report entitled On the Team: Equal Opportunity for Transgender Student \nAthletes (2010) by Dr. Pat Griffin & Helen J. Carroll (On the Team), \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/NCLR_TransStudentAthlete%2B(2).pdf.

The On the \nTeam report noted that policies that may be appropriate at the college level may “be unfair and too complicated \nfor [the high school] level of competition.” On the Team at 26. After engaging in similar processes, some state \ninterscholastic athletics associations have adopted policies for participation by transgender students in high school \nathletics that they determined were age-appropriate. \n19 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(a), (b).

It has come to ED’s attention that many transgender students \n(i.e., students whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth) \nreport feeling unsafe and experiencing verbal and physical harassment or assault in school, and \nthat these students may perform worse academically when they are harassed.  School \nadministrators, educators, students, and parents are asking questions about how to support \ntransgender students and have requested clarity from ED.  In response, ED developed two \ndocuments: \n  ED’s Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division \njointly issued a Dear Colleague Letter (“DCL”) about transgender students’ rights and \nschools’ legal obligations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.1  Any \nschool that has questions related to transgender students or wants to be prepared to \naddress such issues if they arise should review the DCL.  \n  ED’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education compiled the attached examples of \npolicies2 and emerging practices3 that some schools are already using to support \ntransgender students.  We share some common questions on topics such as school \nrecords, privacy, and terminology, and then explain how some state and school district \npolicies have answered these questions.  We present this information to illustrate how \nstates and school districts are supporting transgender students.  We also provide \ninformation about and links to those policies at the end of the document, along with \nother resources that may be helpful as educators develop policies and practices for their \nown schools.   \n                                                           \n1 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688; Dear Colleague Letter: Transgender Students (May 13, 2016), \nwww.ed.gov/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf. \n2 In this document, the term policy or policies refers generally to policies, guidance, guidelines, procedures, \nregulations, and resource guides issued by schools, school districts, and state educational agencies. \n3 ED considers emerging practices to be operational activities or initiatives that contribute to successful outcomes \nor enhance agency performance capabilities.  Emerging practices are those that have been successfully \nimplemented and demonstrate the potential for replication by other agencies.  Emerging practices typically have \nnot been rigorously evaluated, but still offer ideas that work in specific situations. \ni \n\nEach person is unique, so the needs of individual transgender students vary.  But a school policy \nsetting forth general principles for supporting transgender students can help set clear \nexpectations for students and staff and avoid unnecessary confusion, invasions of privacy, and \nother harms.  The education community continues to develop and revise policies and practices \nto address the rights of transgender students and reflect our evolving understanding and the \nindividualized nature of transgender students’ needs.   \nThis document contains information from some schools, school districts, and state and federal \nagencies.

How do schools find out that a student will transition? \nTypically, the student or the student’s parent or guardian will tell the school and ask that the \nschool start treating the student in a manner consistent with the student’s gender identity.  \nSome students transition over a school break, such as summer break.  Other students may \nundergo a gender transition during the school year, and may ask (or their parents may ask on \ntheir behalf) teachers and other school employees to respect their identity as they begin \nexpressing their gender identity, which may include changes to their dress and appearance.  \nSome school district or state policies address how a student or parent might provide the \nrelevant notice to the school.  \n  Alaska’s Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District issued guidelines (“Mat-Su \nBorough Guidelines”) advising  that transgender students or their parents or \nguardians should contact the building administrator or the student’s guidance \ncounselor to schedule a meeting to develop a plan to address the student’s \nparticular circumstances and needs. \n \n  The guidelines issued by Washington’s Superintendent of Public Instruction \n(“Washington State Guidelines”) offer an example of a student who first attended \nschool as a boy and, about midway through a school year, she and her family \ndecided that she would transition and begin presenting as a girl.  She prefers to \ndress in stereotypically feminine attire such as dresses and skirts.  Although she is \ngrowing her hair out and consistently presents as female at school, her hair is still in \na rather short, typically boyish haircut.  The student, her parents, and school \nadministrators asked her friends and teachers to use female pronouns to address \nher.   \n \n2.  How do schools confirm a student’s gender identity? \nSchools generally rely on students’ (or in the case of younger students, their parents’ or \nguardians’) expression of their gender identity.  Although schools sometimes request some \nform of confirmation, they generally accept the student’s asserted gender identity.  Some \nschools offer additional guidance on this issue.  \n  Los Angeles Unified School District issued a policy (“LAUSD Policy”) noting that \n“[t]here is no medical or mental health diagnosis or treatment threshold that \n1 \n\nstudents must meet in order to have their gender identity recognized and \nrespected” and that evidence may include an expressed desire to be consistently \nrecognized by their gender identity. \n \n  The New York State Education Department issued guidance (“NYSED Guidance”) \nrecommending that “schools accept a student’s assertion of his/her/their own \ngender identity” and provides examples of ways to confirm the assertion, such as a \nstatement from the student or a letter from an adult familiar with the student’s \nsituation.  The same guidance also offers the following example:  “In one middle \nschool, a student explained to her guidance counselor that she was a transgender \ngirl who had heretofore only been able to express her female gender identity while \nat home.  The stress associated with having to hide her female gender identity by \npresenting as male at school was having a negative impact on her mental health, as \nwell as on her academic performance.  The student and her parents asked if it would \nbe okay if she expressed her female gender identity at school.  The guidance \ncounselor responded favorably to the request.  The fact that the student presented \nno documentation to support her gender identity was not a concern since the school \nhad no reason to believe the request was based on anything other than a sincerely \nheld belief that she had a female gender identity.”  \n \n  Alaska’s Anchorage School District developed administrative guidelines (“Anchorage \nAdministrative Guidelines”) noting that being transgender “involves more than a \ncasual declaration of gender identity or expression but does not require proof of a \nformal evaluation and diagnosis.  Since individual circumstances, needs, programs, \nfacilities and resources may differ; administrators and school staff are expected to \nconsider the needs of the individual on a case-by-case basis.” \n \n3.  How do schools communicate with the parents of younger students compared to \nolder transgender students? \nParents are often the first to initiate a conversation with the school when their child is \ntransgender, particularly when younger children are involved.  Parents may play less of a role in \nan older student’s transition.  Some school policies recommend, with regard to an older \nstudent, that school staff consult with the student before reaching out to the student’s parents. \n  The District of Columbia Public Schools issued guidance (“DCPS Guidance”) noting \nthat “students may choose to have their parents participate in the transition \nprocess, but parental participation is not required.”  The guidance further \n2 \n\nrecommends different developmentally appropriate protocols depending on grade \nlevel.  The DCPS Guidance suggests that the school work with a young student’s \nfamily to identify appropriate steps to support the student, but recommends \nworking closely with older students prior to notification of family.  The guidance also \nprovides a model planning document with key issues to discuss with the student or \nthe student’s family. \n \n  Similarly, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education \nissued guidance (“Massachusetts Guidance”) that notes:  “Some transgender and \ngender nonconforming students are not openly so at home for reasons such as \nsafety concerns or lack of acceptance.  School personnel should speak with the \nstudent first before discussing a student’s gender nonconformity or transgender \nstatus with the student’s parent or guardian.  For the same reasons, school \npersonnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer to the \nstudent, e.g., appropriate pronoun use, in written communication to the student’s \nparent or guardian.” \n \n  Chicago Public Schools’ guidelines (“Chicago Guidelines”) provide:  “When speaking \nwith other staff members, parents, guardians, or third parties, school staff should \nnot disclose a student’s preferred name, pronoun, or other confidential information \npertaining to the student’s transgender or gender nonconforming status without the \nstudent’s permission, unless authorized to do so by the Law Department.” \n \n  Oregon’s Department of Education issued guidance stating, “In a case where a \nstudent is not yet able to self-advocate, the request to respect and affirm a student’s \nidentity will likely come from the student’s parent. However, in other cases, \ntransgender students may not want their parents to know about their transgender \nidentity. These situations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis and school \ndistricts should balance the goal of supporting the student with the requirement \nthat parents be kept informed about their children. The paramount consideration in \nsuch situations should be the health and safety of the student, while also making \nsure that the student’s gender identity is affirmed in a manner that maintains \nprivacy and confidentiality.”   \n   \n3 \n\nPrivacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records \n4.  How do schools protect a transgender student’s privacy regarding the student’s \ntransgender status? \nThere are a number of ways schools protect transgender students’ interests in keeping their \ntransgender status private, including taking steps to prepare staff to consistently use the \nappropriate name and pronouns.  Using transgender students’ birth names or pronouns that do \nnot match their gender identity risks disclosing a student’s transgender status.  Some state and \nschool district policies also address how federal and state privacy laws apply to transgender \nstudents and how to keep information about a student’s transgender status confidential.   \n  California’s El Rancho Unified School District issued a regulation (“El Rancho \nRegulation”) that provides that students have the right to openly discuss and express \ntheir gender identity, but also reminds school personnel to be “mindful of the \nconfidentiality and privacy rights of [transgender] students when contacting \nparents/legal guardians so as not to reveal, imply, or refer to a student’s actual or \nperceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.” \n \n  The Chicago Guidelines provide that the school should convene an administrative \nsupport team to work with transgender students and/or their parents or guardians \nto address each student’s individual needs and supports.  To protect the student’s \nprivacy, this team is limited to “the school principal, the student, individuals the \nstudent identifies as trusted adults, and individuals the principal determines may \nhave a legitimate interest in the safety and healthy development of the student.” \n \n  The Mat-Su Borough Guidelines state:  “In some cases, a student may want school \nstaff and students to know, and in other cases the student may not want this \ninformation to be widely known.  School staff should take care to follow the \nstudent’s plan and not to inadvertently disclose information that is intended to be \nkept private or that is protected from disclosure (such as confidential medical \ninformation).” \n \n  The Massachusetts Guidance advises schools “to collect or maintain information \nabout students’ gender only when necessary” and offers an example:  “One school \nreviewed the documentation requests it sent out to families and noticed that field \ntrip permission forms included a line to fill in indicating the student’s gender.  Upon \nconsideration, the school determined that the requested information was irrelevant \nto the field trip activities and deleted the line with the gender marker request.” \n \n4 \n\n5.  How do schools ensure that a transgender student is called by the appropriate name \nand pronouns? \nOne of the first issues that school officials may address when a student notifies them of a \ngender transition is determining which name and pronouns the student prefers.  Some schools \nhave adopted policies to prepare all school staff and students to use a student’s newly adopted \nname, if any, and pronouns that are consistent with a student’s gender identity.  \n  A regulation issued by Nevada’s Washoe County School District (“Washoe County \nRegulation”) provides that: “Students have the right to be addressed by the names \nand pronouns that correspond to their gender identity.  Using the student’s \npreferred name and pronoun promotes the safety and wellbeing of the student.  \nWhen possible, the requested name shall be included in the District’s electronic \ndatabase in addition to the student’s legal name, in order to inform faculty and staff \nof the name and pronoun to use when addressing the student.”  \n \n  A procedure issued by Kansas City Public Schools in Missouri (“Kansas City \nProcedure”) notes that:  “The intentional or persistent refusal to respect the gender \nidentity of an employee or student after notification of the preferred pronoun/name \nused by the employee or student is a violation of this procedure.” \n \n  The NYSED Guidance provides:  “As with most other issues involved with creating a \nsafe and supportive environment for transgender students, the best course is to \nengage the student, and possibly the parent, with respect to name and pronoun use, \nand agree on a plan to reflect the individual needs of each student to initiate that \nname and pronoun use within the school.  The plan also could include when and \nhow this is communicated to students and their parents.” \n \n  The DCPS Guidance includes a school planning guide for principals to review with \ntransgender students as they plan how to ensure the school environment is safe and \nsupportive.  The school planning guide allows the student to identify the student’s \ngender identity and preferred name, key contacts at home and at school, as well as \ndevelop plans for access to restrooms, locker rooms, and other school activities. \n \n   \n5 \n\n6.  How do schools handle requests to change the name or sex designation on a student’s \nrecords? \nSome transgender students may legally change their names.  However, transgender students \noften are unable to obtain identification documents that reflect their gender identity (e.g., due \nto financial limitations or legal restrictions imposed by state or local law).  Some school district \npolicies specify that they will use the name a student identifies as consistent with the student’s \ngender identity regardless of whether the student has completed a legal name change. \n  The NYSED Guidance provides that school records, including attendance records, \ntranscripts, and Individualized Education Programs, be updated with the student’s \nchosen name and offers an example:  “One school administrator dealt with \ninformation in the student’s file by starting a new file with the student’s chosen \nname, entered previous academic records under the student’s chosen name, and \ncreated a separate, confidential folder that contained the student’s past information \nand birth name.” \n \n  The DCPS Guidance notes:  “A court-ordered name or gender change is not required, \nand the student does not need to change their official records.  If a student wishes \nto go by another name, the school’s registrar can enter that name into the \n‘Preferred First’ name field of [the school’s] database.” \n \n  The Kansas City Procedure recognizes that there are certain situations where school \nstaff or administrators may need to report a transgender student’s legal name or \ngender.  The procedure notes that in these situations, “school staff and \nadministrators shall adopt practices to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of such \nconfidential information.” \n \n  The Chicago Guidelines state: “Students are not required to obtain a court order \nand/or gender change or to change their official records as a prerequisite to being \naddressed by the name and pronoun that corresponds to their gender identity.” \n \n  The Massachusetts Guidance also addresses requests to amend records after \ngraduation:  “Transgender students who transition after having completed high \nschool may ask their previous schools to amend school records or a diploma or \ntranscript that include the student’s birth name and gender.  When requested, and \nwhen satisfied with the gender identity information provided, schools should amend \nthe student’s record.” \n6 \n\nSex-Segregated Activities and Facilities \n7.  How do schools ensure transgender students have access to facilities consistent with \ntheir gender identity? \nSchools often segregate restrooms and locker rooms by sex, but some schools have policies \nthat students must be permitted to access facilities consistent with their gender identity and \nnot be required to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or alternative facilities.  \n  The Washington State Guidelines provide:  “School districts should allow students to \nuse the restroom that is consistent with their gender identity consistently asserted \nat school.”  In addition, no student “should be required to use an alternative \nrestroom because they are transgender or gender nonconforming.” \n \n  The Washoe County Regulation provides:  “Students shall have access to use \nfacilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and \nasserted at school, irrespective of the gender listed on the student’s records, \nincluding but not limited to locker rooms.” \n \n  The Anchorage Administrative Guidelines emphasize the following provision:  \n“However, staff should not require a transgender or gender nonconforming \nstudent/employee to use a separate, nonintegrated space unless requested by the \nindividual student/employee.” \n \n8.  How do schools protect the privacy rights of all students in restrooms or locker \nrooms? \nMany students seek additional privacy in school restrooms and locker rooms.  Some schools \nhave provided students increased privacy by making adjustments to sex-segregated facilities or \nproviding all students with access to alternative facilities.   \n  The Washington State Guidelines provide that any student who wants increased \nprivacy should be provided access to an alternative restroom or changing area.  The \nguidelines explain:  “This allows students who may feel uncomfortable sharing the \nfacility with the transgender student(s) the option to make use of a separate \nrestroom and have their concerns addressed without stigmatizing any individual \nstudent.” \n \n7 \n\n  The NYSED Guidance gives an example of accommodating all students’ interest in \nprivacy:  “In one high school, a transgender female student was given access to the \nfemale changing facility, but the student was uncomfortable using the female \nchanging facility with other female students because there were no private changing \nareas within the facility.  The principal examined the changing facility and \ndetermined that curtains could easily be put up along one side of a row of benches \nnear the group lockers, providing private changing areas for any students who \nwished to use them.  After the school put up the curtains, the student was \ncomfortable using the changing facility.” \n \n  Atherton High School, in Jefferson County, Kentucky, issued a policy that offers \nexamples of accommodations to address any student’s request for increased \nprivacy:  “use of a private area within the public area of the locker room facility (e.g. \nnearby restroom stall with a door or an area separated by a curtain); use of a nearby \nprivate area (e.g. nearby restroom); or a separate changing schedule.” \n \n  The DCPS Guidance recommends talking to students to come up with an acceptable \nsolution:  “Ultimately, if a student expresses discomfort to any member of the \nschool staff, that staff member should review these options with the student and \nask the student permission to engage the school LGBTQ liaison or another \ndesignated ally in the building.” \n \n9.  How do schools ensure transgender students have the opportunity to participate in \nphysical education and athletics consistent with their gender identity? \n \nSome school policies explain the procedures for establishing transgender students’ eligibility to \nparticipate in athletics consistent with their gender identity.  Many of those policies refer to \nprocedures established by state athletics leagues or associations.   \n  The NYSED Guidance explains that “physical education is a required part of the \ncurriculum and an important part of many students’ lives.  Most physical education \nclasses in New York’s schools are coed, so the gender identity of students should not \nbe an issue with respect to these classes.  Where there are sex-segregated classes, \nstudents should be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender \nidentity.” \n \n  The LAUSD Policy provides that “participation in competitive athletics, intramural \nsports, athletic teams, competitions, and contact sports shall be facilitated in a \n8 \n\nmanner consistent with the student’s gender identity asserted at school and in \naccordance with the California Interscholastic Federation bylaws.”  The California \nInterscholastic Federation establishes a panel of professionals, including at least one \nperson with training or expertise in gender identity health care or advocacy, to make \neligibility decisions. \n \n  The Rhode Island Interscholastic League’s policy states that all students should have \nthe opportunity to participate in athletics consistent with their gender identity, \nregardless of the gender listed on school records.  The policy provides that the \nleague will base its eligibility determination on the student’s current transcript and \nschool registration information, documentation of the student’s consistent gender \nidentification (e.g., affirmed written statements from student, parent/guardian, or \nhealth care provider), and any other pertinent information. \n \n10. How do schools treat transgender students when they participate in field trips and \nathletic trips that require overnight accommodations? \n \nSchools often separate students by sex when providing overnight accommodations.  Some \nschool policies provide that students must be treated consistent with their gender identity in \nmaking such assignments. \n  Colorado’s Boulder Valley School District issued guidelines (“Boulder Valley \nGuidelines”) providing that when a school plans overnight accommodations for a \ntransgender student, it should consider “the goals of maximizing the student’s \nsocial integration and equal opportunity to participate in overnight activity and \nathletic trips, ensuring the [transgender] student’s safety and comfort, and \nminimizing stigmatization of the student.” \n \n  The Chicago Guidelines remind school staff:  “In no case should a transgender \nstudent be denied the right to participate in an overnight field trip because of \nthe student’s transgender status.” \n   \n9 \n\nAdditional Practices to Support Transgender Students \n11. What can schools do to make transgender students comfortable in the classroom?  \nClassroom practices that do not distinguish or differentiate students based on their gender are \nthe most inclusive for all students, including transgender students.   \n  The DCPS Guidance suggests that “[w]herever arbitrary gender dividers can be \navoided, they should be eliminated.” \n \n  The Massachusetts Guidance states that “[a]s a general matter, schools should \nevaluate all gender-based policies, rules, and practices and maintain only those that \nhave a clear and sound pedagogical purpose.” \n \n  Minneapolis Public Schools issued a policy providing that students generally should \nnot be grouped on the basis of sex for the purpose of instruction or study, but rather \non bases such as student proficiency in the area of study, student interests, or \neducational needs for acceleration or enrichment. \n \n  The Maryland State Department of Education issued guidelines that include an \nexample of eliminating gender-based sorting of students: “Old Practice: boys line up \nover here.” New Practice: birthdays between January and June; everybody who is \nwearing something green, etc.” \n \n12. How do school dress codes apply to transgender students? \nDress codes that apply the same requirements regardless of gender are the most inclusive for \nall students and avoid unnecessarily reinforcing sex stereotypes.  To the extent a school has a \ndress code that applies different standards to male and female students, some schools have \npolicies that allow transgender students to dress consistent with their gender identity. \n  Wisconsin’s Shorewood School District issued guidelines (“Shorewood Guidelines”) \nthat allow students to dress in accordance with their gender identity and remind \nschool personnel that they must not enforce a dress code more strictly against \ntransgender and gender nonconforming students than other students. \n \n  The Washington State Guidelines encourage school districts to adopt gender-neutral \ndress codes that do not restrict a student’s clothing choices on the basis of gender:  \n“Dress codes should be based on educationally relevant considerations, apply \n10 \n\nconsistently to all students, include consistent discipline for violations, and make \nreasonable accommodations when the situation requires an exception.” \n \n13. How do schools address bullying and harassment of transgender students? \nUnfortunately, bullying and harassment continue to be a problem facing many students, and \ntransgender students are no exception.  Some schools make clear in their nondiscrimination \nstatements that prohibited sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity \nand expression.  Their policies also address this issue.   \n \n  The NYSED Guidance stresses the importance of protecting students from bullying \nand harassment because “[the] high rates experienced by transgender students \ncorrespond to adverse health and educational consequences,” including higher rates \nof absenteeism, lower academic achievement, and stunted educational aspirations. \n \n  The Shorewood Guidelines specify that harassment based on a student’s actual or \nperceived transgender status or gender nonconformity is prohibited and notes that \nthese complaints are to be handled in the same manner as other discrimination, \nharassment, and bullying complaints. \n \n  The DCPS Guidance provides examples of prohibited harassment that transgender \nstudents sometimes experience, including misusing an individual’s preferred name \nor pronouns on purpose, asking personal questions about a person’s body or gender \ntransition, and disclosing private information. \n \n14. How do school psychologists, school counselors, school nurses, and school social \nworkers support transgender students? \nSchool counselors can help transgender students who may experience mental health disorders \nsuch as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress.  Mental health staff may also consult \nwith school administrators to create inclusive policies, programs, and practices that prevent \nbullying and harassment and ensure classrooms and schools are safe, healthy, and supportive \nplaces where all students, including transgender students, are respected and can express \nthemselves. Schools will be in a better position to support transgender students if they \ncommunicate to all students that resources are available, and that they are competent to \nprovide support and services to any student who has questions related to gender identity.   \n11 \n\n  The NYSED Guidance suggests that counselors can serve as a point of contact for \ntransgender students who seek to take initial steps to assert their gender identity in \nschool. \n \n  The Chicago Guidelines convene a student administrative support team to \ndetermine the appropriate supports for transgender students.  The team consists of \nthe school principal, the student, adults that the student trusts, and individuals the \nprincipal determines may have a legitimate interest in the safety and healthy \ndevelopment of the student. \n \n15. How do schools foster respect for transgender students among members of the \nbroader school community? \nDeveloping a clear policy explaining how to support transgender students can help \ncommunicate the importance the school places on creating a safe, healthy, and \nnondiscriminatory school climate for all students.  Schools can do this by providing educational \nprograms aimed at staff, students, families, and other community members.   \n  The Massachusetts Guidance informs superintendents and principals that they \n“need to review existing policies, handbooks, and other written materials to ensure \nthey are updated to reflect the inclusion of gender identity in the student \nantidiscrimination law, and may wish to inform all members of the school \ncommunity, including school personnel, students, and families of the recent change \nto state law and its implications for school policy and practice.  This could take the \nform of a letter that states the school’s commitment to being a supportive, inclusive \nenvironment for all students.” \n \n  The NYSED Guidance states that “school districts are encouraged to provide this \nguidance document and other resources, such as trainings and information sessions, \nto the school community including, but not limited to, parents, students, staff and \nresidents.” \n \n16. What topics do schools address when training staff on issues related to transgender \nstudents?  \nSchools can reinforce commitments to providing safe, healthy, and nondiscriminatory school \nclimates by training all school personnel about appropriate and respectful treatment of all \nstudents, including transgender students. \n12 \n\n  The Massachusetts Guidance suggests including the following topics in faculty and \nstaff training “key terms related to gender identity and expression; the development \nof gender identity; the experiences of transgender and other gender nonconforming \nstudents; risks and resilience data regarding transgender and gender nonconforming \nstudents; ways to support transgender students and to improve school climate for \ngender nonconforming students; [and] gender-neutral language and practices.” \n \n  The El Rancho Regulation states that the superintendent or designee “shall provide \nto employees, volunteers, and parents/guardians training and information regarding \nthe district’s nondiscrimination policy; what constitutes prohibited discrimination, \nharassment, intimidation, or bullying; how and to whom a report of an incident \nshould be made; and how to guard against segregating or stereotyping students \nwhen providing instruction, guidance, supervision, or other services to them. Such \ntraining and information shall include guidelines for addressing issues related to \ntransgender and gender-nonconforming students.” \n \n17. How do schools respond to complaints about the way transgender students are \ntreated? \nSchool policies often provide that complaints from transgender students be handled under the \nsame policy used to resolve other complaints of discrimination or harassment. \n  The Boulder Valley Guidelines provide that “complaints alleging discrimination or \nharassment based on a person’s actual or perceived transgender status or gender \nnonconformity are to be handled in the same manner as other discrimination or \nharassment complaints.” \n \n  The Anchorage Administrative Guidelines provide that “students may also use the \nStudent Grievance Process to address any civil rights issue, including transgender \nissues at school.” \n   \n13 \n\nTerminology \n18. What terms are defined in current school policies on transgender students? \nUnderstanding the needs of transgender students includes understanding relevant terminology.  \nMost school policies define commonly used terms to assist schools in understanding key \nconcepts relevant to transgender students.  The list below is not exhaustive, and only includes \nexamples of some of the most common terms that school policies define.   \n  Gender identity refers to a person’s deeply felt internal sense of being male or \nfemale, regardless of their sex assigned at birth.  (Washington State Guidelines) \n \n  Sex assigned at birth refers to the sex designation, usually “male” or “female,” \nassigned to a person when they are born.  (NYSED Guidance)   \n \n  Gender expression refers to the manner in which a person represents or expresses \ngender to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, activities, voice or \nmannerisms.  (Washoe County Regulation) \n  Transgender or trans describes a person whose gender identity does not correspond \nto their assigned sex at birth.  (Massachusetts Guidance) \n  Gender transition refers to the process in which a person goes from living and \nidentifying as one gender to living and identifying as another.  (Washoe County \nRegulation) \n  Cisgender describes a person whose gender identity corresponds to their assigned \nsex at birth.  (NYSED Guidance) \n \n  Gender nonconforming describes people whose gender expression differs from \nstereotypic expectations.  The terms gender variant or gender atypical are also used. \nGender nonconforming individuals may identify as male, female, some combination \nof both, or neither.  (NYSED Guidance) \n \n  Intersex describes individuals born with chromosomes, hormones, genitalia and/or \nother sex characteristics that are not exclusively male or female as defined by the \nmedical establishment in our society.  (DCPS Guidance) \n \n  LGBTQ is an acronym that stands for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and \nqueer/questioning.”  (LAUSD Policy) \n14 \n\n \n  Sexual orientation refers to a person’s emotional and sexual attraction to another \nperson based on the gender of the other person.  Common terms used to describe \nsexual orientation include, but are not limited to, heterosexual, lesbian, gay, and \nbisexual.  Sexual orientation and gender identity are different.  (LAUSD Policy) \n \n19. How do schools account for individual preferences and the diverse ways that students \ndescribe and express their gender? \nSome students may use different terms to identify themselves or describe their situations.  For \nexample, a transgender male student may identify simply as male, consistent with his gender \nidentity.  The same principles apply even if students use different terms.  Some school policies \ndirectly address this question and provide additional guidance. \n  The Washington State Guidelines recognize how “terminology can differ based on \nreligion, language, race, ethnicity, age, culture and many other factors.” \n  Washington’s Federal Way School District issued a resource guide that states:  “Keep \nin mind that the meaning of gender conformity can vary from culture to culture, so \nthese may not translate exactly to Western ideas of what it means to be \ntransgender. Some of these identities include Hijra (South Asia), Fa’afafine (Samoa), \nKathoey (Thailand), Travesti (South America), and Two-Spirit (Native American/First \nNations).” \n  The Washoe County Regulation, responding to cultural diversity within the state, \noffers examples of “ways in which transgender and gender nonconforming youth \ndescribe their lives and gendered experiences:  trans, transsexual, transgender, \nmale-to-female (MTF), female-to-male (FTM), bi-gender, two-spirit, trans man, and \ntrans woman.” \n  The DCPS Guidance provides this advice to staff:  “If you are unsure about a \nstudent’s preferred name or pronouns, it is appropriate to privately and tactfully ask \nthe student what they prefer to be called.  Additionally, when speaking about a \nstudent it is rarely necessary to label them as being transgender, as they should be \ntreated the same as the rest of their peers.” \n \n   \n15 \n\nCited

Also \nbefore the Court are Defendants’ Motion for Clarification (ECF No. 65), filed September 12, 2016; \nPlaintiffs’ Response (ECF No. 73), filed September 19, 2016, and Defendants’ Reply (ECF No. \n74), filed September 23, 2016.  The Court held a hearing on September 30, 2016 to address the \nissues raised in these pleadings.  See ECF No. 76.  Defendants seek to clarify the Court’s \npreliminary injunction in this case.   \n  The parties have agreed in their briefing that the injunction is directed at the issue of access \nto intimate facilities.  Pls.’ Resp. Mot. Clarify 3–5, ECF No. 73; Defs.’ Reply Mot. Clarify 1–2 \nn.1–2, ECF No. 74.  At oral argument Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed that Defendants may offer textual \nanalyses of Title IX and Title VII in cases where the Government and its agencies are defendants, \nand if the United States Supreme Court or any Circuit Court requests that Defendants file amicus \n1 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 2 of 7   PageID 1509\ncuriae briefs, they may do so.  Tr’g 26–28; 32–33.  Thus, the remaining issues related to the request \nfor clarification appear to be (1) whether Defendants’ Guidelines are enjoined in total or whether \nthe principle of severability applies to them; (2) whether the injunction applies to Title VII \ninvestigations, particularly as it applies to workplaces where school teachers or school staff may \nor must use the same intimate facilities as students; (3) whether the injunction applies to OSHA or \nDOL activity; (4) whether the injunction prevents Government agencies from carrying out their \nstatutory duties, which traditionally fall within their core missions to prevent various forms of \ndiscrimination; and (5) the geographic scope of the injuction.  Mot. Clarify 6–11, 16–21, ECF No. \n65. \n  Having considered the parties’ submissions and applicable law, the Court finds that the \nparties must provide additional briefing on whether the Defendants’ Guidelines are enjoined in \ntotal or whether the principal of severability applies to them, whether Title VII is implicated by \nthis injunction, and whether the injunction applies to OSHA or DOL activity.  Plaintiffs must \nsubmit a response addressing these issues on or before October 24, 2016.  Defendants must submit \na reply on or before October 28, 2016.   \n  Furthermore, the Court offers the following clarifications to its August 21, 2016 Order \ngranting the preliminary injunction (ECF No. 58): \nI.  NATIONWIDE INJUNCTION  \n  The Court’s August 21, 2016 Order granted a nationwide injunction.  ECF No. 58.  \nDefendants argue that “the geographic scope of the Preliminary Injunction [] could be read to \nexceed the proper scope of relief available to the [P]laintiffs in this case” and they contend that \nthis “would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s admonition that ‘injunctive relief should be no more \n2 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 3 of 7   PageID 1510\nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.’”  Mot. \nClarify 2, 16, ECF No. 65 (citing Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)); Defs.’ Reply \n2–4, ECF No. 74; Tr’g at 6–7.  According to Defendants, they have a right to rely on the Guidelines \nin litigation before other courts that have agreed with their interpretation of sex in Title VII and \nIX to mean gender identity.  Tr’g at 7.   \n  Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants are federal administrators and agencies, with footings in \nevery state and territory” and they are “collectively and systematically engaged in enforcing a \npervasive and unlawful rule across the country . . . .”  Resp. Mot. Clarify 9–10, ECF No. 73.  “An \ninjunction that precludes Defendants from acting everywhere[,]” Plaintiffs contend, “is quite \nclear.”  Id.; Tr’g at 17–19 (arguing that the geographic extent of the harm Plaintiffs suffer is \nnationwide).  The Court agrees that the scope of this injunction should be and is nationwide. \n  As stated in one of the most recent Texas v. United States Fifth Circuit opinions, “the \nConstitution vests the District Court with ‘the judicial Power of the United States[,]’” and “[t]hat \npower is not limited to the district wherein the court sits but extends across the country. It is not \nbeyond the power of a court, in appropriate circumstances, to issue a nationwide injunction.”  \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting U.S. Const. art. III, §1), aff’d \nby equally divided Supreme Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (June 23, 2016) (finding that a nationwide \ninjunction was warranted because “partial implementation of DAPA would ‘detract from the \nintegrated scheme of regulation created by Congress,’” and create a “substantial likelihood that a \ngeographically-limited injunction would be ineffective . . . .”); see also Chevron Chem. Co. v. \nVoluntary Purchasing Grps., 659 F.2d 695, 705–06 (5th Cir. 1981) (directing the district court to \nissue broad injunction on remand in a trade dress case); Califano, 442 U.S. at 702 (finding that the \n3 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 4 of 7   PageID 1511\nscope of an injunction is dictated by the extent of the violation, not the geographical extent of the \nplaintiff class, thus a nationwide injunction was consistent with the principles of equity); Brennan \nv.

Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 455 F.2d 818, 826 (5th Cir. \n1972) (“[C]ourts should not be loath to issue injunctions of general applicability . . . . The \ninjunctive processes are a means of effecting general compliance with national policy as expressed \nby Congress, a[s] public policy judges too must carry out—actuated by the spirit of the law and \nnot begrudgingly as if it were a newly imposed fiat of a presidium.”); Wirtz v. Ocala Gas Co., 336 \nF.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1964) (describing certain FLSA injunctions as “sufficiently broad and \ngeneral to enjoin any practices which would constitute violations of the Act’s provisions”). \n  It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this Court has the power to \nissue a nationwide injunction where appropriate.  Both Title IX and Title VII rely on the consistent, \nuniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy.  A nationwide \ninjunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide.  Defendants are a group \nof  agencies  and  administrators  capable  of  enforcing  their  Guidelines  nationwide,  affecting \nnumerous state and school district facilities across the country.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88.  Should \nthe Court only limit the injunction to the plaintiff states who are a party to this cause of action, the \nCourt risks a “substantial likelihood that a geographically-limited injunction would be ineffective.” \nId.1   \n                                                           \n1 As noted previously, “Those states who do not want to be covered by this injunction can easily avoid \ndoing so by state law that recognizes the permissive nature § 106.33.  It therefore only applies to those \nstates whose laws direct separation.  However, [this] injunction should not unnecessarily interfere with \nlitigation currently pending before other federal courts on this subject regardless of the state law.”  Order \n37, ECF No. 58. \n4 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 5 of 7   PageID 1512\n  Accordingly, Defendants Motion to Clarify is DENIED as they request that the Court limit \nthe injunction to plaintiff states.  \nII.  INJUNCTION DOES NOT AFFECT DEFENDANTS’ CORE MISSIONS  \nDefendants argue that the Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order (ECF No. 58) should \nclarify that it does not enjoin the EEOC from fulfilling statutory duties necessary to protect the \nrights of individuals alleging discrimination and that it does not affect programs which combat \ndiscrimination based on race, national origin, or disability and other  activities, or limit the \nenforcement of anti-discrimination statues outside the plaintiff states.  See Mot. Clarify 6–11, 16–\n21, ECF No. 65 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b), (e)(1), (f)(1); E.E.O.C. v. Bass Pro Outdoors \nWorld, L.L.C., No 15-20078, 2016 WL 3397696, at *8 (5th Cir. June 17, 2016); 29 C.F.R § 1614).  \nThe Court CLARIFIES that these duties are not affected by the Preliminary Injunction Order \n(ECF No. 58).   \nIndeed, the Court’s Order did not purport to alter any statute or statutory duties Defendants \nmay exercise in pursuit of their governmental duties under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the American with Disabilities Act \nof 1990.  This injunction also does not affect a school’s obligation to investigate and remedy \nstudent complaints of sexual harassment, sex stereotyping, and bullying.  \nDefendants are simply prevented from using the Guidelines to argue that the definition of \n“sex” as it relates to intimate facilities includes gender identity.  Order 36–37, ECF No. 58.  The \nCourt’s preliminary injunction neither affects EEOC’s fulfillment of its statutory duties, nor \nDefendants’ ability to enforce anti-discrimination statutes nationwide.  The injunction does not \naffect those programs addressing discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, or disability.  \n5 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 6 of 7   PageID 1513\nDefendants are simply “enjoined from using the Guidelines or asserting the Guidelines carry \nweight in any litigation initiated following the date of [its August 21, 2016] Order.”2  Order 37, \nECF No. 58.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  Accordingly, the Court clarifies that: (1) the preliminary injunction applies nationwide; and \n(2)  Defendants’  core  missions  to  combat  discrimination  based  on  race,  national  origin,  or \ndisability, and the EEOC’s statutory duties are not otherwise affected by the preliminary injunction \n(ECF No. 58).   \n  The injunction is limited to the issue of access to intimate facilities.  Defendants are \nenjoined from relying on the Guidelines, but may offer textual analyses of Title IX and Title VII \nin cases where the Government and its agencies are defendants or where the United States Supreme \n                                                           \n2 Plaintiffs have also listed numerous cases that they believe are not enjoined by the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction in their Notice of Pending Litigation.  See Not. Pending Lit. 10–13, ECF No. 64.  The Court \nagrees and clarifies that these cases are not included in the injunction.  At oral argument, Defendants asked \nthe Court to restrict the injunction to litigation in which the plaintiff states are involved.  Tr’g at 7–8.  The \nCourt clarifies that the preliminary injunction attaches to Defendant’s conduct in litigation not substantially \ndeveloped before the August 21, 2016 Order (ECF No. 58), regardless of whether plaintiff states are \ninvolved.  The Court seeks to avoid unnecessarily interfering with litigation concerning access to intimate \nfacilities that was substantially developed before the Court’s Order granting the preliminary injunction.  In \npending litigation concerning access to intimate facilities, if no responsive pleadings were filed and no \nsubstantive rulings issued before August 21, 2016, the preliminary injunction applies and Defendants are \nenjoined from relying on the Guidelines.  The injunction applies in part to United States v. Southeastern \nOkla. Univ., a case filed by the DOJ against a public university in Oklahoma (a plaintiff state here) more \nthan a year before the Court’s August 21, 2016 injunction.  No. 5:15-cv-324 (W.D. Okla.).  Although the \nDOJ did not make the issue at the heart of this injunction (access to intimate facilities) a central feature of \nthe complaint, the aggrieved private party has now intervened and introduced new claims that involve \naccess to intimate facilities.  No. 15:15-cv-324, ECF No. 23.  Because litigation in Southeastern was \nsubstantially underway before the issuance of this injunction, DOJ’s legal arguments in the case fall outside \nthe scope of this injunction.  However, Defendants (including DOJ) are still “enjoined from enforcing the \nGuidelines against Plaintiffs and their respective schools, school boards, and other public, educationally-\nbased institutions” (including Southeastern Oklahoma State University) and “enjoined from initiating, \ncontinuing, or concluding any investigation based on Defendants’ interpretation that the definition of sex \nincludes gender identity in Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex”.  ECF No. 58 \nat 37.  \n6 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 7:16-cv-00054-O   Document 86   Filed 10/18/16    Page 7 of 7   PageID 1514\nCourt or any Circuit Court request that Defendants file amicus curiae briefing on this issue.  The \nparties are ORDERED to brief the remaining issues of whether the Defendants’ Guidelines are \nenjoined in total or whether the principal of severability applies to them, whether the injunction \nimplicates Title VII in any manner (and specifically where school employees and staff may share \nintimate facilities with students), and whether OSHA or DOL activity is implicated by the \ninjunction.  Plaintiffs must respond on or before October 24, 2016, and Defendants must reply on \nor before October 28, 2016.   \nSO ORDERED on this 19th day of October, 2016. \n7 \n ",

The United \nStates Appellants do not oppose the motion to dismiss. We grant the motion. \nI \n  The  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  sued  Southeastern \nOklahoma State University and its governing board  in the Western District of \nOklahoma (the Southeastern Litigation), asserting a Title VII claim for alleged \ndiscrimination  and  retaliation  against  Dr.  Tudor,  a  professor  who  is \ntransgender.  Dr. Tudor subsequently intervened.  Oklahoma moved to dismiss \non the ground that Dr. Tudor was not a member of a protected class for Title \nVII purposes.  The District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied \nthe motion, reasoning that Dr. Tudor fell within a protected class because the \ndefendants’ actions “were based upon their dislike of her gender.” \n  Over a year later, the District Court for the Northern District of Texas \nissued the preliminary injunction that is currently  at issue in the appeal \npending before this court.  In its order clarifying the preliminary injunction, \nthe District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted that because the \n                                         \n* Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not \nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH \nCIR. R. 47.5.4. \n2 \n\n      Case: 16-11534      Document: 00513870234     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/09/2017\nNo. 16-11534 \nSoutheastern Litigation “was substantially underway before the issuance of \nthis injunction, DOJ’s legal arguments in the case fall outside the scope of this \ninjunction.”  However, the clarification stated that the preliminary injunction \n“still ‘enjoin[s] [the United States] from enforcing the Guidelines against [the \nStates]  and  their  respective  schools,  school  boards,  and  other  public, \neducationally-based  institutions’  (including  Southeastern  Oklahoma  State \nUniversity) and ‘enjoin[s] [the United States] from initiating, continuing, or \nconcluding any investigation based on [the United States’] interpretation that \nthe definition of sex includes gender identity in Title IX’s prohibition against \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.’”  Thereafter, the district court for the \nWestern District of Oklahoma stayed the Southeastern Litigation. \n  Dr.  Tudor  then  moved  pursuant  to  Rule  24(b)  to  intervene  in  the \nNorthern District of Texas case.1   She sought a declaratory judgment in that \ncourt that the order issued by the district court in the Southeastern Litigation \n“finally decided the question of whether Dr. Tudor is a member of a protected \nclass under Title VII.”  Both the States and the United States opposed Dr. \nTudor’s motion to intervene in the district court.  Although the District Court \nfor the Northern District of Texas has not ruled on the motion to intervene,2 \nDr.  Tudor  has  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  seeking  review  of  the  preliminary \ninjunction.  The States moved in this court to dismiss her appeal, and the \nUnited States does not oppose that motion. \n \n \n                                         \n1 FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b). \n2 When a motion to intervene is denied, the movant may appeal that ruling.  Edwards \nv. City of Houston, 78 F.3d 983, 992 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).  If a district court unreasonably \ndelays in ruling on a motion, mandamus relief requiring a prompt ruling may be available.  \nSee In re Scott, 163 F.3d 282, 283-84 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam); In re Sch. Asbestos Litig., \n977 F.2d 764, 792 (3d Cir. 1992). \n3 \n\n      Case: 16-11534      Document: 00513870234     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/09/2017\nNo. 16-11534 \n \nII \nA \n  “It is well-settled that one who is not a party to a lawsuit, or has not \nproperly become a party, has no right to appeal a judgment entered in that \nsuit.”3  Dr. Tudor is not a party: she is neither “[o]ne by or against whom a \nlawsuit is brought” nor a successful intervenor.4  Nevertheless, she argues that \n“[w]here a non-party is injured or directly aggrieved by an appealable order \nissued by the district court, the nonparty may appeal it without formally \nmoving to intervene.”  To support this proposition, she relies on this court’s \nunpublished decision in In re Taxable Municipal Bond Securities Litigation.5  \nBut in that case, not only did we expressly “decline to rule on the dictum of this \ncourt . . . that ‘[i]f an injunction extends to non-parties, they may appeal from \nit,’” we also granted the motion to dismiss the nonparty’s appeal because “the \nappellants clearly ha[d] an effective means of obtaining review,” which was to \nseek intervention.6   \nWe have recognized an exception to this well-settled rule that allows \nnonparties  to  “rely  on  a  vague  balancing  test  to  overcome  the  general \npresumption against non-party appeals.”7  If the court were to apply this test, \nit  would  assess  “whether  ‘the  non-parties  actually  participated  in  the \nproceedings below, the equities weigh in favor of hearing the appeal, and the \n                                         \n3 Edwards v. City of Houston, 78 F.3d 983, 993 (5th Cir. 1996). \n4 See United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928, 933 (2009) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1154 (8th ed. 2004)); \nsee id. (noting that the Supreme Court has “indicated that intervention is the requisite \nmethod for a nonparty to become a party to a lawsuit”).   \n5 979 F.2d 1535, 1535 (5th Cir. 1992) (unpublished) (quoting United States v. Chagra, \n701 F.2d 354, 359 (5th Cir. 1983)). \n6 Id. \n7 In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., 570 F.3d 244, 249 (5th Cir. 2009). \n4 \n\n      Case: 16-11534      Document: 00513870234     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/09/2017\nNo. 16-11534 \nnon-parties have a personal stake in the outcome.’”8  Dr. Tudor, however, has \nnot referenced this test in her brief, and as a result, she has forfeited its \napplication.9  Even absent forfeiture, Dr. Tudor has not cited any authority, \nand we have found none (outside of those involving collateral orders10), in \nwhich this court has allowed a nonparty to appeal without intervening and \nwithout having actually participated in the proceedings below.  \nB \nAlternatively, Dr. Tudor requests that we treat her appellate brief as a \nmotion to intervene because it serves the “purpose” of such a motion in that it \n“timely  apprise[s]  the  parties  and  court  of  the  nonparty’s  interest  in  the \nappeal.”  Although timely notice of a nonparty’s interest might be a purpose of \na motion to intervene, it is not the principal purpose; it does not establish that \na nonparty can intervene, that is, that the nonparty “has a claim or defense \nthat shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”11  Dr. \nTudor’s appellate brief is not the equivalent of a motion to intervene.  \nIII \n  Dr. Tudor also argues that the States’ motion to dismiss should be denied \nbecause it is untimely.  She acknowledges that neither the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure nor this court’s rules “prescribe a deadline for filing a \nmotion to dismiss an appeal.”  Instead, she asserts that we should deny the \nmotion to dismiss because “it is in the interests of justice and doing so will \navoid prolonging litigation for no good reason.”  Dr. Tudor has provided no case \n                                         \n8 Searcy v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., 117 F.3d 154, 157 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting \nEEOC v. La. Office of Cmty. Servs., 47 F.3d 1438, 1442 (5th Cir. 1995)).  \n9 Miller v. Metrocare Servs., 809 F.3d 827, 832 n.5 (5th Cir. 2016). \n10 See Chagra, 701 F.2d at 358–59 (5th Cir. 1983); see also Devlin v. Scardeletti, 536 \nU.S. 1, 16–17 (2002) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (explaining that non-parties have been “allowed \nto appeal from the collateral orders to which they were parties”). \n11 FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b)(1)(B). \n5 \n\n      Case: 16-11534      Document: 00513870234     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/09/2017\nNo. 16-11534 \nin which a court has dismissed a motion to dismiss an appeal as untimely, and \nwe are not convinced that it would be in the interest of justice to allow a \nnonparty to pursue an appeal.  It is also unclear how granting the motion to \ndismiss will prolong the litigation, a point which Dr. Tudor’s brief does not \nelucidate. \n*          *          * \n  For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the States’ motion to dismiss. \n6 ",
