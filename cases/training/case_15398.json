    "summary": "<p>On May 28, 2014, a private plaintiff with mental disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiff sued the Louisiana Department of Safety and Corrections and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals under the American Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the defendants violated his rights under those statutes and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff, represented by the Advocacy Center of Louisiana and the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center, sought compensatory and punitive damages, permanent injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and declaratory relief that defendant's policies, procedures, and practices, as well as Louisiana Criminal Code articles 658(B) and 899 were unconstitutional.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that, in 2008, he was charged with possession of a firearm as a felon based upon two prior convictions. Before standing trial, he was found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI), and was ordered to be conditionally released for five years provided he receive adequate treatment and monitoring. He was ordered to reside in a group home, living with other male individuals with mental disabilities. In July 2013, about six months before the five-year term was complete, the plaintiff was hospitalized and deprived of needed medicine for his mental illness; and as a consequence yelled threatening outbursts to other individuals in the group home when he returned. He was then arrested for violating his conditional release, where he spent a month in prison, only being released after his attorney filed a habeas corpus petition. There were never any criminal charges filed, and he was not informed of his rights.</p><p>The plaintiff filed this complaint in 2014 for the above actions in 2013. In December 2013, however, the forensic coordinator at the Department of Health and Hospitals recommended the plaintiff's conditional release be extended an additional year. During this extension, he was involuntarily committed to a mental health hospital. On July 1, 2014, while hospitalized, hospital staff determined his probation should be revoked, and he was again arrested and incarcerated without any criminal charges filed. Both times he was incarcerated, he was deprived of his needed medication and neither given opportunity to post bail nor informed of his rights. While incarcerated, he was placed in lockdown for mental reasons. These lockdowns limited his use of the canteen and gave him no exercise time. The plaintiff was released on August 25, 2014, again after his attorney filed for habeas corpus relief. </p><p>After his second incarceration, the plaintiff filed amended complaints to include the new allegations and to add defendant Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals to the suit.</p><p>During the pretrial phase, both the plaintiff and the defendants filed separate motions for summary judgement, both of which were denied by U.S. Judge John W. deGravelles. On June 24, 2016, the defendants appealed the district court's denial of motion for summary judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The defendants moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal on June 26; the Fifth Circuit granted the defendants' motion July 8, 2016.</p><p>From June 27 to 29, 2016, the district court held a jury trial as to the Americans with Disabilities Act claims. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, finding neither of them to had violated the ADA. At the judge's request, both parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. </p><p>In July 2017, Judge deGravelles set dates for oral argument for the remaining claims and the plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law. Oral arguments took place on September 20. The court published an opinion on September 29 entering judgment in favor of the defendants. </p><p>Applying the <i>Youngberg</i> balancing test and substantive due process analysis, the court held the statutory scheme was facially constitutional. The arrests were reasonably related to a legitimate government objective, and the two instances of the plaintiff's arrest were insufficient to establish a policy, procedure, or practice. The court held that a reasonable jury could have found that the care the plaintiff received was not discriminatory and a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances. Judge deGravelles dismissed all the plaintiff's claims with prejudice, and the case is now closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiff Trussell George (“Plaintiff” or “George”) brings this action by and through his \nguardian ad litem Letetica Walker. (Mot. to Appoint a Guardian Ad Litem, Doc. 58 at 1; \nand Order, Doc. 63 at 1.) George is a person with a mental illness, who, on September 25, \n2008, was found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (“NGRI”) of possession of a firearm by \na known felon. (Order, Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000001.)  On December 15, 2008, he was \ngranted a Judgment of Supervised Probation and was conditionally released. (Id. See also \nPl.’s Trial Exs. 4 at TG000005, 6 at TG000007, 24 at 1, ¶ 2.) \n2.  While on conditional release, George was arrested and placed in the East Baton Rouge \nParish Prison (“EBRPP”) on two separate occasions, July 29, 2013 and July 1, 2014. \n3.  Plaintiff’s  claims  against  various  defendants  (“Defendants”)  are  for  declaratory  and \nprospective injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, 29 U.S.C. Section 794(a) and \n42 U.S.C. Section 12132 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65. (Pl.’s Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 42 at 18–23.) He claims that the \narrests and detentions were wrongful and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the above statutes. (Pl.’s Request for \nFinding of Fact and Rulings of Law, Doc. 151 at 1–2, 32–33.)  \n4.  For the reasons which follow, the requested relief is denied. \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 5 of 78\nB.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n5.  By way of a complaint (Complaint, Doc. 1) and two amended complaints (Pl.’s First \nAmended Complaint, Doc. 24 and Doc. 42),1 Plaintiff sued two agencies of the State of \nLouisiana, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (“LDPSC”) and the \nLouisiana Department of Health (“LDH”),2 along with seven individuals in their official \ncapacities:  James  M.  LeBlanc  (“LeBlanc”),  Rebekah  E.  Gee  (“Gee”),  Whalen  Gibbs \n(“Gibbs”), Gerald Starks (“Starks”), Scott Tubbs (“Tubbs”), Eric Brady (“Brady”) and \nCharles Vosburg (“Vosburg”), (collectively, “Defendants”).3   \n6.  The suit originally asked for compensatory and punitive damages as well as declaratory and \ninjunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983; 29 U.S.C. Section 794(a), Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504” or the “RA”); and 42 U.S.C. Section 12132, \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). However, Plaintiff’s \nclaims against Gibbs, Starks, Vosburg, Brady and Tubbs in their individual capacities were \ndismissed on June 25, 2016, (Mot. to Voluntarily Dismiss Claims for Damages Against \nDefs.’ [sic] Whalen Gibbs, Geral [sic] Starks, Charles Vosburg, Eric Brady, and Scott Tubbs \nin their Individual Capacities, Docs. 129 at 1; Minute Entry, Doc. 138 at 2), leaving only \nthe official capacity claims against all Defendants. (Trial Tr. vol. 1, Doc. 148 at 26:17–\n27:19.) \n                                                 \n1 Because an amended complaint supplants and replaces prior complaints, Eubanks v. Parker Cty. Commr’s Court, \n1995 WL 10513, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 3, 1995); Hall v. Louisiana, 983 F. Supp. 2d 820, 832 (M.D. La. 2013), the Court \nconsiders Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 42, in globo) to be the operative pleading in this action. \n2 Since the filing of these complaints, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals has been re-designated the \nLouisiana Department of Health. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 36:251. \n3 Where appropriate, a public official’s successor is automatically substituted as a party consistent with Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 25(d). \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 6 of 78\n7.  Motions for summary judgment were filed by both Plaintiff (Pls.’ Mot. For Partial Summ. \nJ., Doc. 76 at 3.) and Defendants (Defs.’ Mot. For Summ. J., Doc. 74 at 4,) and both were \ndenied. (Order, Doc. 112 at 1; Order and Ruling on Mots. For Summ. J., Doc. 124 at 30.) \nAs a part of the rulings, the Court found that two of the involved statutes, La. Code Crim. \nProc. arts. 658 and 899, were facially constitutional but that there were fact questions \nprecluding summary judgment. (Doc. 124 at 3, 22–26.) \n8.  The Court also found there were questions of fact which needed to be resolved in order to \ndetermine George’s claims arising under the ADA and Section 504. (Id. at 28-30.)  \n9.   On June 27 through June 29, 2016, the case was tried simultaneously to a jury and the \nCourt. (Minute Entry, Doc. 138–139, in globo; Minute Entry, Doc. 145, in globo; Trial Tr. \nvol. 1, Doc. 148, in globo; Trial Tr. vol. 2, Doc. 149, in globo; and Trial Tr. vol. 3, Doc. \n150,  in globo.) At the conclusion of the trial, that portion of the case tried to the jury was \nsubmitted to it for decision. The jury rendered a verdict for LDPSC and LDH on the claims \narising under Section 504 and the ADA.  (Jury Verdict Form, Doc. 144 at 2–3.)  Specifically, \nthe jury found that these defendants had not discriminated against Plaintiff under Section \n504 and the ADA and had not failed to make reasonable accommodations to Plaintiff’s \ndisabilities under either statute.  (Id.) \n10. As to that portion of the case tried to the Court, the Court took the matter under advisement \nand the parties were ordered to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law within \n30 days of the filing of the trial transcript. (Doc. 150 at 192:22-193:1).  The parties’ \nproposed findings and conclusions were filed as Docs. 151 and 152, respectively. (Pl.’s \nRequest for Finding of Fact and Rulings of Law, Doc. 151 at 51; Defs.’ Proposed Findings \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 7 of 78\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law, Doc. 152 at 13.) The Court then requested the parties’ \nresponses to certain specific questions. (Doc. 159.) They responded in Docs. 160 (Plaintiff’s \nMemorandum of Law (“P Mem.”)) and 161 (Defendants’ Answers to Questions Raised (“D \nMem.”).)  Plaintiff’s response also asked the Court to “consider his renewed motion for \njudgment as a matter of law” with respect to his Section 504 and ADA claims. (Doc. 160 at \n23.)  The Court heard oral argument on September 20, 2017.  (Doc. 164).  Following oral \nargument, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental Memorandum discussing whether a settlement \nagreement in another case moots or bars his claims4 (Doc. 167), and Defendants filed a \nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of \nLaw (Doc. 168). \nC.    SUMMARY OF CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES \n11. Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ “policies, practices and procedures . . . caused him to be \narrested and incarcerated on two separate occasions . . . [in] violat[ion] of his rights under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \nand  subjected  him  to  intentional  discrimination  in  violation  of  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 . . . and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” \n(Doc. 42 at 2, ¶ 1.) \n12. The “policies, practices and procedures” about which Plaintiff specifically complains are \nthose “which cause persons who have been found NGRI and are able to be released on \nspecified conditions without danger to themselves or others to be confined in correctional \n                                                 \n4 Because the Court denies George’s claims on the merits, see infra, it does not discuss this issue. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 8 of 78\nfacilities for the sole reason that they are alleged to have violated a condition of their release \n. . . .” (Doc. 42 at 19, ¶ 91; 20–21, ¶ 97; 21, ¶ 101; 22, ¶ 106; and 23, ¶ 109.) \n13. In addition, Plaintiff claims “Defendants’ actions . . . which caused Plaintiff to be confined \nin a correctional facility for the sole reason that he is alleged to have violated a condition of \nhis  release,  violate  his  rights  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  to  the  United  States \nConstitution.” (Doc. 42 at 19, ¶ 93.) \n14. In his post-trial briefing, Plaintiff broadens this contention. There, Plaintiff contends that \n“Defendants, acting under color of state law and pursuant to state policies and practices, \ndeprived [Plaintiff] of his liberty by intentionally incarcerating him in the East Baton Rouge \nParish prison twice, once in 2013 and again in 2014 (1) for allegedly violating a term of his \nconditional release, even though there was no allegation, nor probable cause to believe, that \nhe had violated any criminal statute; (2) for behavior [] that was a clear manifestation of his \nmental illness; and (3) despite the fact that he clearly needed treatment in a state or private \nmental health institution.” (Doc. 151 at 1.) \n15. In his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asks for both declaratory and injunctive relief. \nAs to the former, he asks the Court to declare “that Defendants’ policies, practices and \nprocedures of arresting and incarcerating individuals in state correctional facilities who have \nbeen placed on conditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are \nalleged to have violated a condition of their discharge, violate Plaintiff’s rights under the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the American with Disabilities Act of \n1990.” (Doc. 42 at 23-24; see also Doc. 151 at 1–2.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 9 of 78\n16. In addition, Plaintiff asks for an injunction “prohibiting Defendants from arresting and \nincarcerating individuals in state correctional facilities who have been placed on conditional \ndischarge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to have violated a \ncondition of their discharge.” (Doc. 42 at 23, ¶ B.) \n17. The Court notes that the relief requested in Plaintiff’s post-trial briefing is in some respects \nbroader and in others more specific than in his Second Amended Complaint, namely \nrequesting an injunction requiring: \na.  “So long as Mr. George remains on conditional discharge, Defendants are prohibited \nfrom arresting and incarcerating him in any correctional facility because there is an \nallegation that he violated a condition of his discharge in the absence of a reasonable \nbelief that he has committed a criminal offense.” (Doc. 151 at 50, ¶ 193.) \nb.  “[T]he Defendants [are barred] from arresting and incarcerating [Plaintiff] solely \nbecause he has violated a term of his conditional release.” (Id. at 2.) \nc.  “If Mr. George is alleged to have violated a condition of his discharge, but he is not \ncharged with a new criminal offense, Defendants’ sole recourse is to have him \nvoluntarily admitted to ELMHS or another a suitable mental health treatment facility \npursuant to La. R.S. 28:52, or by emergency certificate to such a facility pursuant to \nLa.  R.S.  28:53,  with  subsequent  notice  to  the  court.  La.  Code  Crim.  P.  art. \n658(B)(4).” (Id. at 50, ¶ 194.) \nd.  “Defendants  shall,  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  promulgate  and \nimplement written policies and procedures that prohibit its agents, employees, \ncontractors,  or  assigns  from  arresting  and  incarcerating  any  individuals  in \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 10 of 78\ncorrectional facilities who have been placed on conditional discharge following a \nfinding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to have violated a condition of their \ndischarge. Such policies and procedures shall also provide that if an individual who \nhas been placed on conditional discharge following a finding of NGRI is alleged to \nhave violated a condition of his discharge, but that individual has not been charged \nwith a new criminal offense, Defendants’ sole recourse is to have him voluntarily \nadmitted to ELMHS or another [] suitable mental health treatment facility pursuant \nto La. R.S. 28:52, or by emergency certificate to such a facility pursuant to La. R.S. \n28:53, with subsequent notice to the court. La. Code Crim. P. art 658(B)(4).” (Id. at \n50-51, ¶ 195.) \n18. In Plaintiffs’ briefing, Plaintiff also seems to raise complaints broader than that needed to \nsupport the relief he requests, namely the length of time George was incarcerated, the quality \nof care he received while in jail, and the issue of George’s lengthy incarcerations without a \nhearing. (See, e.g. Doc. 151 at 15-18, ¶¶ 59-68; 37, ¶ 151.) In response to the Court’s inquiry \non this issue, counsel for Plaintiff reassured the Court that the constitutional issue in this \ncase is limited to the issue of whether the arrest and incarceration of George solely for \nviolations of conditions of release in the absence of a criminal arrest violated George’s \nsubstantive due process rights, and do not include the issues of length of incarceration before \nrelease, length of incarceration without or before a hearing, and adequacy of medical care \nand other issues. (Doc. 163 at 1.)  \n19. The Court notes that although the Second Amended Complaint also asks the Court to declare \nLa. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 658(B) and 899 facially unconstitutional (Doc. 42 at 24), the \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 11 of 78\nCourt previously denied that challenge. (Doc. 124 at 18-19, 22-24.) Plaintiff’s demand for \ncompensatory and punitive damages was voluntarily dismissed. (Docs. 129 at 1; 138 at 2; \n148 at 26:19–27:4.) \n20. Defendants, on the other hand, contend that, at all times, they acted reasonably and within \nthe bounds of the law and that Defendants’ conduct as well as their policies, procedures and \npractices did not violate the Constitution, Section 504, or the ADA. (Doc. 152 at 10–12, \n¶ 89, ¶ 97–99, ¶ 105–106.) \n21. According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s arrests and incarcerations were provoked by Plaintiff’s \naggressive, assaultive and dangerous behavior and were supported by probable cause that \nhe was violating or about to violate the terms and conditions of his release. (Id. at 5, 10-12.) \n22. In addition, Defendants contend that George’s arrests and incarcerations until he could have \na hearing and be placed in a suitable psychiatric facility were made because he was a danger \nto himself and others and thus were justified under both Louisiana’s statutory scheme and \nthe Constitution. (Id. at 10–12.) \n23. Defendants urge the Court to find, as the jury did, that there was no discrimination against \nPlaintiff under either the ADA or Section 504. (Id. at 12, ¶¶ 104–105.) \n24. Finally, Defendants claim that  the facts adduced at trial justify neither a declaratory \njudgment nor injunction under any law and therefore ask this Court to reject all of Plaintiff’s \nremaining claims against Defendants. \nD.    ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT \n25. In order to resolve this dispute, the Court must resolve the following issues: \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 12 of 78\na.  Did Defendants have in place policies, practices, or procedures causing or allowing \nNGRI acquittees to be arrested and incarcerated at a correctional facility solely for \na violation (or anticipated violation) of the conditions of the acquittee’s release, even \nwhen no crime had been committed? \nb.  Were George’s arrests or incarcerations made pursuant to this policy? \nc.  Even if there were no such policies, procedures or practices, under the specific facts \nof this case, did George’s arrests and subsequent incarcerations at a correctional \nfacility, solely because of a violation of his conditions of release, in the absence of \na criminal arrest, violate his substantive due process rights under the United States \nConstitution and/or his statutory rights under Section 504 and the ADA? \nE.    BACKGROUND AND PARTIES’ FACTUAL ARGUMENTS \n26. Plaintiff is a person with mental illness who, on September 25, 2008, was found NGRI of a \ncriminal offense, specifically the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (Trial \nStipulations, Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 2, Trial Stipulation No. 5; see also Pl.’s Trial Ex. 4 at \nTG000005; & Pl.’s Trial Ex. 6 at TG000007.) \n27. On December 15, 2008, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge, \nLouisiana, the court with jurisdiction over his criminal charges, ordered that George be \nconditionally released from inpatient hospitalization and into the community pursuant to \nLa. Code Crim. Proc. art. 657.1, for a period of five years. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000001; \nPl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 1, No. 2.) \n28. In issuing the 2008 conditional release order, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court found \nthat George was not in need of further inpatient treatment, provided that he receive adequate \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 13 of 78\noutpatient treatment, supervision, and monitoring. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000001; Pl.’s Trial \nEx. 24 at 1, No. 3.) \n29. However, this release was conditioned on Plaintiff following certain requirements. The most \nimportant of these, for purposes of the issues in this case, states, in pertinent part: \nAny physically assaultive/aggressive behaviors shall be reported to \nthe  District  Forensic  Coordinator  or  State  Probation  Officer. \nViolations of this condition may result in immediate return to custody \nor intensified treatment if recommended by the District Forensic \nCoordinator or Probation Officer.  \n \n(Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000002, ¶ K; see also Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 1, No. 3.)  \n \n30. The following additional condition was imposed by law:  \n \nIt shall be a condition of every such probation that the person released \nshall be recommitted if he becomes dangerous to others or to himself \nfor reasons of his mental illness, substance abuse, or intellectual \ndisability.  \n \nLa. Code. Crim. Proc. art. 658(A) (2014). \n \n31. From December 2008 to May 2014, as required under the terms of his conditional release, \nGeorge resided in group homes operated by Progressive Health Care Providers (PHP), \nlocated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 2, No. 4; Martinez Test., Doc. 148 \nat 30:18–31:2, 35:13–36:22, 45:5–15; Hope Test., Doc. 149 at 175:3–11.) \n32. “While living in group homes, George was under the joint supervision of the [Division of \nProbation  and  Parole  (“DPP”)]  of  the  [LDPSC]  and  [Community  Forensic  Services \n(“CFS”)] of the [LDH] . . . ” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 2, No. 5.) The details of the respective \nduties of these two state agencies towards George and other NGRI acquittees is discussed \nin more detail infra.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 14 of 78\n33. Although the location of the group home changed after 2008, George resided in a group \nhome setting as required by his conditional release order until May 2014. (Id. at 2, No. 4; \nMartinez Test., Doc. 148 at 30:18–31:2, 35:13–36:22, 45:5–15; Hope Test., Doc. 149 at \n175:3–11.) \n34. The group homes in which George was placed were Intermediate Care Facilities for People \nwith Developmental Disabilities (“ICF-DD”). (Martinez Test., Doc. 148 at 29:24–30:13.) \n35. Intermediate Care Facilities for People with Developmental Disabilities (“ICFs-DD”) are \nfunded through the Medicaid program and operated by the Defendant LDH. (Hope Test., \nDoc. 149 at 201:14–24.) \n36. Medicaid is a federally mandated program that provides federal financial assistance to \nstates, including Louisiana, so that that they can provide medical care to poor and disabled \nindividuals. See 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(a), 1396d(b); see generally Curtis v. Taylor, 625 \nF.2d 645 (5th Cir. 1980). \n37. ICFs-DD are one of a number of residential services options operated under the auspices of \nthe LDH. (See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28:451.1–455.2 (2005)). They provide various services \nfor those who reside there. \n38. Due to his mental illness, George would occasionally engage in verbal aggression, non-\ncompliance and threatening behavior at the group home and at the day program he attended \nduring the week. His Behavioral Support Plan noted these outbursts, and the threatening \nepisodes would usually occur when his medication was not correct. (Hope Test., Doc. 149 \nat 188:1–189:21; Pl.’s Ex. 17, TG000151–53.)  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 15 of 78\n39. Therefore, medication management was a critical service for George. As Ms. Martinez \nstated: \nA.  Trussell  is  very  different  off  medication.  When  he’s  not \ntaking  medication,  he’s  very  delusional,  very  nervous, \nagitated,  untrustworthy,  very  disheveled,  not  –  not  the \nTrussell that I've known for -- for the years that I’ve known \nhim. \n \nQ.  When you say, ‘delusional,’ can you give me an example of \nhow that would manifest itself? \n \nA.   Trussell would talk a lot about god and the devil and Bob \nand – \n \nQ.   Bob? \n \nA.   Bob.  When  --  when  Trussell  --  the  times  that  I've  seen \nTrussell in what I say is a delusional manner, he talks about \nBob. And Bob is a person that is in his life that fights Satan \nand fights the devil and steals money and tries to kill people. \n \n(Martinez Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 34:14–35:3.) \n40. Prior to July 2013, Mr. George occasionally–two or three times a year–would be voluntarily \nadmitted (sometimes at his request) to a hospital to have his medication adjusted. (See \nMartinez Test., Doc. 148 at 35:4–25.)  \n41. As  previously  mentioned,  while  living  in  group  homes,  George  was  under  the  joint \nsupervision of the DPP of the LDPSC and of the CFS of LDH. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 2, No. \n5; see also La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B) (2014).)  \n42. Defendants LDPSC and LDH received federal financial assistance and are public entities as \ndefined by 42 U.S.C. Section 12131(1)(B). (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 16.)  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 16 of 78\nF.    DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS’ OVERSIGHT \nRESPONSIBILITIES FOR PERSONS ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE \n \n43. Defendant LDPSC is the state agency responsible for monitoring and providing services to \npersons placed on conditional release or probation pursuant to La. Code. Crim. Proc. art. \n657. DPP is the division within LDPSC that carries out this duty and which supervised \nGeorge’s conditional release. (Id. at 2, No. 6.) \n44. Specifically, it is the responsibility of the DPP to ensure that the general and special \nconditions of the ordered supervision are followed for each acquittee (also sometimes \nreferred to as “supervisee”). Its employees make personal contact with the supervisees \npursuant to DPP’s policies and when otherwise necessary. The agency is responsible for \nmonitoring supervisees for compliance with conditions, addressing any issues required by \nthe courts, consulting with the forensic coordinator, drug testing supervisees, and arresting \nsupervisees. (Id. at 2, No. 7.) \n45. At the time of trial, Defendant LeBlanc was Secretary of LDPSC. Pursuant to La. R.S. \n36:403, he was responsible for the administration, control, and operation of the functions, \nprograms, and affairs of the LDPSC. (Id. at 3, No. 8.)  \n46. Defendant Gibbs was the Assistant Secretary of LDPSC and, as such, he directed the \noperations of DPP. Pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.11(A), DPP provides for the investigation \nand supervision of adjudicated adult offenders. Also, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. art. \n658(B)(1), the DPP is charged with supervising individuals who have been placed on \nconditional release following a finding of NGRI. (Id. at 3, No. 9.) \n47. Defendant Starks was the Director of the DPP. As such, he assisted in the administration, \ndevelopment, and implementation of policies of the DPP. (Id. at 3, No. 10.) \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 17 of 78\n48. Defendant Tubbs was a Probation and Parole Officer of DPP. (Id. at 3, No. 11; see also Doc. \n148 at 64:14–19.) \n49. Tubbs specialized in supervising mentally ill people for about seven years at the time of \ntrial, including those acquitted as NGRI. (Doc. 148 at 64:20–65:14.) \n50. Tubbs had the responsibility to monitor the conditional release of George. (Id. at 65:13–17.) \nG.    LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH’S OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES \nFOR PERSONS ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE \n \n51. Defendant LDH is a state agency that operates the CFS program and Eastern Louisiana \nMental Health System (“ELMHS”) in Jackson, Louisiana. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 13.) \n52. Defendant LDH receives federal financial assistance. (Id. at 4, No. 16.) \n53. Defendant Gee was the Secretary of the LDH.  Pursuant to La. R.S. 36:254, the Secretary \nof the LDH was responsible for the oversight, supervision and control of LDH and its \ndivisions and was ultimately responsible for ensuring that LDH’s services for people with \ndisabilities were provided in conformance with federal law. (Id. at 3, No. 12.) \n54. Defendant Brady was employed by LDH as a District Forensic Coordinator (“DFC”) within \nthe CFS program. (Id. at 4, No. 14; see also Doc. 151 at 9, ¶ 33 & Doc. 152 at 3, ¶ 15.) As \nsuch, Brady worked under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of the LDH. (Pl.’s \nTrial Ex. 24 at 3, No. 12.) \n55. Brady had responsibility for monitoring individuals who were found NGRI and placed on \nconditional discharge and for implementing certain policies and procedures of LDH with \nrespect to such persons. (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 92:8–11, 99:12–101:15.) \n56. One of Brady’s functions as a DFC was to facilitate inpatient hospitalization when other \navenues for treatment failed. (Brady Test., Doc. 148, 102:10–104:15.) \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 18 of 78\n57. Brady visited George to perform “six-month evaluations” and provided reports regarding \nGeorge’s compliance with the terms of his conditional release and recommending whether \nGeorge should continue on conditional release. (See Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 107–108, in \nglobo.)  \n58. Defendant Vosburg was a clinical psychologist and a consultant for CFS and LDH. (Pl.’s \nTrial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 15; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 8, in globo.)  \n59. Vosburg  had  responsibility  for  evaluating  and  providing  mental  health  services,  in \naccordance with the policies and procedures of LDH, to individuals placed on conditional \ndischarge  and  persons  found  NGRI  who  had  been  placed  at  ELMHS.  He  provided \nrecommendations as to placement, graduation/termination, revocation, and treatment.  (See \nPl.’s Trial Exs. 4 at TG000005, ¶ 2; 5 at TG000006; 6 at TG000007; 8 at TG000010; 9 at \nTG000011; 13 at TG000017; and 14 at TG000019.) \n60. Vosburg  had  evaluation  and  oversight  responsibilities  regarding  George’s  conditional \nrelease since 2009 and over the course of that time had evaluated George on at least eight \noccasions. (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 107:20–108:5; Pl.’s Trial Exs. 4 at TG000005; 5 at \nTG000006; 6 at TG000007; 8 at TG000010; 9 at TG000011; 13 at TG000011; and 14 at \nTG000019; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 8, in globo.) \nH.   TRUSSELL GEORGE’S ARREST AND INCARCERATION IN JULY 2013 \n61. On May 24, 2013, Brady submitted an episode report to the state district court indicating \nthat staff at Progressive Health Care had reported to him that George “had two episodes of \nverbal aggression and verbal threats within the last two (2) weeks to have one of his family \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 19 of 78\nmembers attack one of their direct care staff members.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 8 at TG000010; see \nalso Defs.’ Trial Ex. 3 at 0001.) \n62. In this report, Brady also noted that, although George had been recently hospitalized for \napproximately two weeks at Beacon Behavioral Hospital in Lutcher, Louisiana, and had \nreceived a medication adjustment, “his behavior seemingly has escalated towards direct care \npersonnel.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 8 at TG000010; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 3 at 0001.).  \n63. This report also stated that Brady “spoke to his probation officer [Defendant Tubbs] on \n5/23/13 who [would] be petitioning this honorable court for a status review to discuss these \nrecent events and plan of action to address these concerns.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 8 at TG000010; \nDefs.’ Trial Ex. 3 at 0001.) \n64. On June 10, 2013, Tubbs sent a letter to the state district court advising “that in the last 4 \nweeks [George] has been verbally aggressive with staff over food” and requested that a \nreview hearing be scheduled to address George’s violations of the group home’s rules. (Pl.’s \nTrial Ex. 9 at TG000011; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 4 at 0001; Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 74:23–75:5.) \n65. For reasons not explained in the evidence, the State District Court did not respond to that \nrequest for a hearing.  \nQ.   And you don’t know if a court ever set a date for a hearing on \nthese issues, did it? \nA.   I don’t believe they did on that letter. \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 75:24–76:1.) \n66. In addition, staff personnel at the group home advised Tubbs that they did not want George \nat their group home because he kept causing problems. (Id. at 82:8-10). \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 20 of 78\n67. “On or about 7-15-13, [George] got aggressive with a staff member at his day program and \nthey had to send him to the mental hospital due to his attitude. He was released from the \nhospital on 7-25-13.” (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5 at 1–2.) According to Tubbs’ testimony at trial, he \nwas told that George had assaulted or physically harmed a staff member. (Tubbs Test., Doc. \n148 at 78:2–79:25.)  \n68. On July 25, 2013, the day of George’s release from the mental hospital, Tubbs met with \nGeorge and felt something “wasn’t right” and that “the medicine that they adjusted wasn’t \nworking for him.” (Id. at 80:7–9.) \n69. “On [July 27, 2013], [George] told staff that he was going to do something to them if they \ndid not bring him to get his hair cut. Then [he] told another client that he was going to kill \nthem.” (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5 at 1–2.)5 \n70. At this point, Tubbs conferred with Brady, who in turn consulted with Vosburg.  (Tubbs \nTest., Doc. 148 at 84:2–5; 124:17–23.) Tubbs told Brady that George was being “very \naggressive.” (Id. at 124:24–125:23.)  \n71. At this point Brady inquired whether there were any beds available at ELMHS and was told \nthere were none. He informed Tubbs of this fact. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 84:6–10. See \nalso Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 122:4-18; 124:22-23; 126:3-13). \n72. Tubbs also consulted with his supervisor regarding the decision of whether to arrest George. \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 84:2–24.)  \n73. Brady, Tubbs and Vosburg jointly decided to have George arrested and placed in the \nEBRPP. (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 124:12–125:23.)  \n                                                 \n5 In his trial testimony, Tubbs testified that this incident occurred on July 25, 2017.  (Doc. 148 at 80:10–13.) This \ndiscrepancy is not important to the Court’s analysis. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 21 of 78\nQ.   So the decision to arrest Mr. George in July 2013 was made \ncollectively by [Brady], Dr. Vosburg and Mr. Tubbs; is that \ncorrect? \n \nA.   Yes, Ma’m [sic]. \n \n(Id. at 125:20–23.) \n74. On July 29, 2013, Tubbs wrote a letter to Progressive stating that “[George] has broken his \nconditions of probation for the 3rd time by being aggressive with staff.” (Pl.’s Ex. 10 at \nTG000012.). Employees of George’s day program drove George to Tubbs’ office, where \nTubbs decided to arrest him and have him incarcerated in EBRPP. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 \nat 81:20–82:24.) \n75. Tubbs’ “Detainer Notification, Affidavit of Probable Cause, and Motion for Hearing” to \nRevoke Probation6 sets forth the basis for Plaintiff’s arrest on July 29, 2013: \nAround June 1st 2013, he was aggressive with staff because he could \nnot get a hamburger for dinner one night. Staff gave him a sandwich \nand he got in the face of a staff member and started yelling “you \nbetter get me a hamburger”. \n \nOn or about 7-15-13, he got aggressive with a staff member at his \nday program and they had to send him to the mental hospital due to \nhis attitude. He was released from the hospital on 7-25-13. \n \nOn 7-27-13, the subject told staff that he was going to do something \nto them if they did not bring him to get his hair cut. Then told another \nclient that he was going to kill them. \n \n(Pl.’s Trial Ex. 11 at TG000014; Defs.’s Trial Ex. 5 at 1–2.) \n \n76. Tubbs testified that he did not decide to arrest George because he suspected George of \nhaving committed a crime;7 indeed, no criminal charges were ever filed against George for \n                                                 \n6 As is discussed, infra, this affidavit and motion were not executed and filed until August 12, 2013. \n7 Nonetheless, in Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000206–207, Tubbs classified George’s conduct as a “Level 3 violation – \nMisdemeanor activity (serious violent).” Tubbs continued, “[George] threatened staff and other clients with violence \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 22 of 78\nany of the activities that gave rise to his arrest. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 82:14–17.) Tubbs \ntestified that the decision to arrest George was in accordance with LDPSC policy. (Id. at \n84:17–20.) \n77. Rather, the decision to arrest George was made because of the consensus reached among \nTubbs, Brady and Vosburg that George was “a danger to himself or others.” (Brady Test., \nDoc. 148 at 124:24–125:23.) Brady considered the behaviors that George was exhibiting at \nthe time of his arrest to be a violation of his conditional release. (Id. at 121:24–122:1.) \n78. According to Brady, George was “transported to the EBR Parish Jail on 7/29/13 secondary \nto aggressive and verbally threatening behaviors towards his peers.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 15 at \nTG000039.) He states that Vosburg, George’s “forensic consultant[,] recommended that he \nbe brought to [ELMHS] for long-term treatment and evaluation services.” (Id.) \n79. On July 29, 2013, the date of George’s arrest, Tubbs also “[c]alled Judge Moore[’s] section \nand they got my letter but no court date has been set as of today.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at \nTG000206.) The letter Tubbs is referring to is presumably the June 10, 2013 letter sent to \nJudge Moore asking the Court to “set a review hearing to address his expiration date and \nviolations.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 9 at 1.) For whatever reason, this information was not elicited \nfrom Tubbs during his testimony. As mentioned above, Tubbs’ June 10 request for a hearing \nwas never responded to and Tubbs waited until August 12, 2013 to file a written motion to \nrevoke George’s probation. \n                                                 \nfor the 3d [sic] time. The group home wanted him out due to his behavior.” Tubbs classified his response to George’s \nconduct as “Level 3 Action – Arrest/Detain with Custodial Treatment… Warrant/Motion and Order to Revoke.” \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 23 of 78\n80. Plaintiff  contends  that  his  behavior  at  the  time  of  his  July  29,  2013  arrest  was  not \nsubstantially different than what he had displayed in the past and did not give probable cause \nfor his arrest and confinement.  \n81. Defendants counter that his conduct, beginning in May 2013 and escalating up until the time \nof his arrest on July 29, 2013, was substantially worse and had not been resolved by the \nMay and July hospitalizations. Thus, argue Defendants, George’s conduct gave Tubbs \nprobable cause for his arrest.  \n82. Another main point of contention in the case revolves around why George was taken to \nEBRPP rather than ELMHS or, alternatively, to a private psychiatric facility as had been \ndone many times in the past, including from July 15 to July 25, 2013.  \n83. Plaintiff argues that Tubbs and Brady were well aware that George had received treatment \nat a number of mental health facilities in the community over the years, including at \nGreenwell  Springs,  Cypress  Hospital,  Our  Lady  of  the  Lake  Hospital,  and  Beacon \nBehavioral Health. (Doc. 151 at 15, ¶ 56) (citing Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 78–80, in globo.)  \n84. Further, argues Plaintiff, Tubbs and Brady were well aware of Mr. George’s need for \npsychiatric medication. (Doc. 151 at 14, ¶ 53.) As Tubbs testified:  \nQ.   And you knew that the symptoms of Mr. George’s illness, like \nhis hallucinations and aggressive behaviors, became worse \nwhen he missed his medication; isn’t that right? \nA.   Yes. \n \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 89:21–24; see also Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 100:20–101:25.) \n85. Tubbs and Brady were also well aware that these hospitalizations were used to manage his \nbehaviors and adjust his medication. (Doc. 151 at 14, ¶ 54.) Tubbs testified: \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 24 of 78\nQ.   And the purpose of those hospital stays was also to control Mr. \nGeorge’s hallucinations; is that right? \nA.   Yes. \nQ.   And in your experience, if Mr. George missed even one or two doses \nof his medication, you believe that he wasn’t able to control the \nvoices in his head? \nA.   It was pretty obvious, yes, when he got off his medicines. \n \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 69:20–70:2; Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 17:16–25.) \n86. Plaintiff stresses that, at the time of George’s arrest, Tubbs and Brady were well aware that \nthere was a direct relationship between the medication George was taking for his mental \nillness and the behavior that led to his arrest. (Doc. 151 at 14-15, ¶ 55) (citing Tubbs Test., \nDoc. 148 at 80–81, in globo, 89–90, in globo.)  \n87. Defendants reply that they tried to place George at ELMHS but there were simply no beds \navailable at that time. (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 122:4–18.) \n88. Brady testified that, following his incarceration at EBRPP and up until his release on August \n23, 2013, they continued to check on the availability of beds at ELMHS and “there [were] \nno beds available, otherwise we would have had him in the hospital.” (Brady Test., Doc. \n148 at 127:21–22.)8  \n89. Neither Tubbs nor Brady checked to see if beds were available at another facility. (Tubbs \nTest., Doc. 148 at 86:13–24, 89:4–12; Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 123:6–11.) \n90. Defendants offer several reasons for this.  First, in response to direct questioning of the \nCourt outside the presence of the jury, both Tubbs and Brady testified that when a NGRI \nacquittee threatens violence, they believed they had only two choices: to admit him to \n                                                 \n8 While the questioning refers to George being released on August 21, 2013, the actual date of release was, according \nto the stipulation of the parties, August 23, 2013. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 17.)  This discrepancy plays no role in \nthe Court’s analysis. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 25 of 78\nELMHS, if a bed was available, or place him in jail until a bed could be found there. (Tubbs \nTest., Doc. 149 at 208:18–211:5; Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 214:10–14.)  \nQ.  So by your way of thinking, there were two choices: first \nELMHS, if there was a bed available, but if not, your only \nother choice was the parish prison? \n \n \nA.  Correct. Until we could go in front of the judge and the judge \ncould make a decision on what to do with him. \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 at 211:1–5.) \n91. Furthermore, said Tubbs, “At that time when he’s threatening violence towards staff . . . \nJackson Hospital would be - - in my opinion, would be the only place that could handle him \nat that point.” (Id. at 208:22–24.) Tubbs believed that George’s behavior was such that he \nneeded more than a medication adjustment at this time. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 89:8–12.) \n92. In addition, Tubbs testified that he didn’t consider another hospital for George because that \nhospital wouldn’t be able to transfer George to court “to address the violation of his \nconditions of probation.” (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 87:5–88:18.)  \n93. Defendants also argue that, even if Tubbs or Brady had tried to get George admitted to a \nprivate hospital, it is unlikely they would have been successful “since nobody wants \nELMHS’s patients, particularly those having forensic involvement, because they worry \nabout their ability to manage them from a security standpoint.” (Doc. 152 at 7, ¶ 62) (citing \nKelly Test., Doc. 149 at 75:3–8.)  \n94. As for transferring Mr. George to Central State Hospital, another state facility, Defendants \ncontend it usually has a long waiting list since they have other referring facilities besides \nELMHS and it takes a long time to get someone admitted there. (Id. at 7, ¶ 61) (citing Kelly \nTest., Doc. 149 at 74:18–24.)  \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 26 of 78\n95. Finally, Tubbs testified that, on arresting George, he contacted Lisa Burns, the social worker \nat EBRPP, and informed her that George was being arrested. Based on this discussion, it \nwas his understanding that Burns would follow up and provide him with mental health \ntreatment and medication management. (Id. at 4, ¶ 25) (citing Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at \n83:14–17.) This was also Brady’s belief. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 218:12–17.) \n96. Plaintiff faults Tubbs and Brady for not checking on Plaintiff while in EBRPP. (Doc. 151 \nat 15, ¶ 60.) Defendants respond that Tubbs was not required to check on George after \nplacing him in jail. (Doc. 152 at 4, ¶ 29) (citing Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 89:8–12.) Brady \ntestified by the time he went to check on him, George had already been discharged. (Brady \nTest., Doc. 149 at 14:12–15:16.) \n97. For reasons not explained in the record, Tubbs waited until August 12, 2013, 15 days after \nGeorge had been incarcerated at EBRPP, before moving for revocation and requesting a \nhearing. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 11; Defs.’s Trial Ex. 5; Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 77:24–78:8.)  \n98. It appears from the record that George was released after a hearing before Judge Moore on \nAugust 23, 2013, not in response to Tubbs’ motion but “only after the [George’s lawyer] \nfiled a petition for habeas corpus on his behalf in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of \nEast Baton Rouge.” (Doc. 42 at 14, ¶ 57.) Defendants admit that, “[a]s a result of the [habeas \ncorpus] hearing, Judge Chip Moore lifted the probation hold and ordered Mr. George to \ncontinue mental health treatment.” (Doc. 161 at 6.) \nI.    EVENTS FOLLOWING AUGUST 23, 2013 RELEASE FROM EBRPP \n99. After his release of August 23, 2013, George was taken directly to Baton Rouge General \nHospital and involuntarily committed. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 16:11–14.) \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 27 of 78\n100. At that time, he was grossly psychotic and off his medication. (Id. at 16:5–6.) \n101. Plaintiff alleges that by the time George was released from the EBRPP on August 23, 2013, \nhe had suffered a significant decline in his mental health and never fully recovered to his \npre incarceration condition. (Martinez Test., Doc. 148 at 43:1–4, 44:1–18; Hope Test., Doc. \n149 at 192:7–19; Smith Test., Doc. 149 at 37:11–17.) \n102.  Between the time of his discharge on August 23, 2013, and the events of July 1, 2014, the \nsecond incident sued upon, George was hospitalized on four occasions, three at private \nhospitals and finally back at ELMHS. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 16:11–18, 17:16–19, 18:1–\n23.)  \nJ.    TRUSSELL GEORGE’S DECEMBER 2013 TO DECEMBER 2014 CONDITIONAL \nRELEASE \n \n103. In December 2013, prior to the expiration of Mr. George’s five-year conditional release \nperiod, LDH’s District Forensic Coordinator, Brady, requested that George’s conditional \nrelease be extended an additional year. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 12 at TG000015-16.) \n104. On April 25, 2014, Vosburg did a comprehensive examination and review of prior records \nfor purposes of a risk assessment. (Defs.’s Trial Ex. 8 at 0002.)  In it, he concluded that \n“there is a high probability of non-compliance with treatment and remediation attempts \nwithout continuation of supervision under probationary requirements.” (Id. at 0010.) \n105. On May 14, 2014, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court extended Mr. George’s conditional \nrelease to December 14, 2014. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 18.)  \n \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 28 of 78\nK.    TRUSSELL GEORGE’S ARREST AND INCARCERATION IN 2014 \n \n106. Within a week after the May 14, 2014 hearing, Brady arranged for Mr. George to be \ninvoluntarily hospitalized at ELMHS. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 18:1–21; Pl.’s Trial Ex. 13 \nat TG000017.)  \n107. According to Dr. Brad McConville, one of George’s treating psychiatrists at ELMHS, \nELMHS has approximately 20 psychiatrists, five of whom are full-time. They also have \npsychologists,  full-time  nursing  staff,  dieticians,  occupational  therapists,  recreational \ntherapists and social workers. (McConville Test., Doc. 149 at 155:1–16.) \n108. During the summer of 2014, George was at the East Acute Unit (EAU) at ELMHS. At this \ntime, psychiatrist Dr. Clay Kelly oversaw George’s care at ELMHS while George’s regular \npsychiatrist, Dr. Ahmad, was on vacation. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 68:1–25.) \n109. On June 3, 2014, Kelly issued an order to transfer George to the Cedarview unit, an \n“intermediate treatment unit in the civil division.” (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 68:20–69:3; \nDefs.’s Trial Ex. 9 at 1604.)  \n110. Cedarview was a “slightly less restrictive unit than East Acute Unit,” and Kelly thought that \nthe transfer to the Cedarview unit was a reasonable step for George. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 \nat 70:1–6.)  According to Kelly, the whole nature of acute treatment is that, once patients \nare reasonably stabilized, they are moved to a less restrictive environment. (Kelly Test., \nDoc. 149 at 72:11–14.) \n111. Dr. Ahmad had wanted to transfer rather than release George because he did not believe that \nGeorge was ready to be returned to a group home. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 69:22–24.) \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 29 of 78\n112. But when Dr. Kelly proposed this move to George on July 1, 2014, George refused to go. \n(Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 69:4–72:18–24.)   \n113. Kelly asked Vosburg to come to the July 1, 2014, meeting with George to discuss moving \nhim to the Cedarview unit and to help explain the plan to gradually step him down out of \nthe acute unit to a less restrictive environment. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 77:10–16.)   \n114. At the July 1, 2014 meeting, Vosburg informed George that he had the option of moving to \na different unit within the ELMHS system but, if he refused the transfer, they could not \nforce him to go the suggested unit.  In that event, Vosburg told George, the next logical step \nwould be to place him at the Forensics Unit at ELMHS. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 13; Kelly Test., \nDoc. 149 at 79:2-20.) \n115. Vosburg further informed George that, if he refused transfer to a different unit, there might \nnot be a bed available at the Forensics unit.  In that case, Mr. George would have to wait in \njail until a bed became available. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 13 at TG000017.) \n116. George immediately resisted the proposed transfer. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 79:13–17.) He \nbecame “very angry” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 13 at TG000017), and even asked to be sent to jail \nbecause he did not want to go to the Cedarview unit.  (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 78:13–15.) \nGeorge started yelling at Drs. Kelly and Vosburg, using threatening language toward them. \n(Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 79:21–24.)   \n117.  Security guards were called to restrain George in the hallway while Vosburg was escorted \noff of the unit for his own protection. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 80:1–6.)  \n118. Kelly contacted the probation officer assigned to George and asked him to remove George \nfrom the unit, although Kelly did not instruct the probation officer to take George to jail. \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 30 of 78\n(Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 80:13–21.) Vosburg did recommend that George be incarcerated \nat EBRPP. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 14.) \n119. As a consequence of this confrontation, George was arrested and transported to EBRPP by \na representative of the DPP for violating the terms of his conditional discharge.  (Pl.’s Trial \nEx. 13, 14.) \n120. Brady was not present during the evaluation of George on July 1, 2014, and found out about \nthe arrest from Vosburg after it had occurred. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 18:22-19:7.) \n121. According to the Narrative Report created by Bobby Castello dated July 1, 2014, Castello \n“[r]eceived a call from Dr. Vosburg at the Feliciana Forensic Facility who told me subject… \nhas been violent and disruptive and has not been taking his medicine. Dr. Vosburg wanted \nsubject removed from the facility and brought before Judge Moore for revocation. Myself \nand Agent Hooge proceeded to ELMHS, arrested subject and transported him to the EBRPP \nwithout incident. Eric Brady, DFC, called and told me he would get a court date and let me \nknow when it would be.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000204.) That court date did not occur \nuntil August 22, 2014. (See id. at TG000203.)  \n122.  According to Brady’s Conditional Release Monthly Review Report of July 1, 2014, Brady \nstated he would “submit [an] episode report and set [a] motion order to court as well as \ncontact  probation  officer  to  assist  with  transportation  to  jail.”  (Pl.’s  Trial  Ex.  15  at \nTG000027.) \n123. Kelly’s decision concerning George on July 1, 2014, was made in light of his history of \ncharges of violence, his previous threatening behavior, and the difficulty George had \nmanaging his impulses and rage over the years. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 86:18–22.)   \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 31 of 78\n124. Dr. Kelly was also concerned for the safety of the other patients should Mr. George remain \non the unit. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 87:7–15.)  \n125. McConville, another psychiatrist who had treated George, testified that George’s violent \nconduct on July 1, 2014, was not unique. “Other times, he was very influenced by his \ndelusions, would attack staff members. He even got into an altercation, fell and broke his \njaw, which had to be surgically repaired. He had incidents like that a lot.”  (McConville \nTest., Doc. 149 at 164:22–25.)   \n126. At this point the Cedarview unit would not have accepted George because of his level of \nanger and rage. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 81:5–7.)  \n127. Kelly testified he did not try to give George any acute treatment such as an injection because \nhe felt George was choosing not to comply with his recommended treatment. (Kelly Test., \nDoc. 149 at 81:22–82:11.)  \n128. The decision to remove George from ELMHS on July 1, 2014, was made by Vosburg and \nKelly, although Brady did not disagree with that decision. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 19:22–\n20:6.) \n129.  According to Brady’s Episode Report, “I consulted with Dr. Vosburg on 7/1/14 after his \nevaluation with George. He recommended revoking his probation and having probation \nofficer remove him from EAU and placing him in [EBRPP] where he remains at this time. \nOur office is requesting a revocation hearing to have his probation revoked and then \ntransfer[]  Mr.  George  back  to  the  Forensic  Hospital  for  longer-term  treatment  and \nhospitalization.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 14.) \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 32 of 78\n130.  On August 22, 2014, 52 days after he was incarcerated, George was taken to state court. At \nthe conclusion of the hearing, “Judge Moore remanded subject back to the Forensic Facility \nand said he wanted a report from the doctors in a couple weeks and if subject was doing \nwell he could be transferred back to the group home. If subject was not doing well he would \ncontinue to reside at the Forensic Facility for further treatment.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at \nTG000203.) \n131.  Three days later, on August 25, 2014, George was released from EBRPP and placed back \nat ELMHS. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 19.)  \n132. George was not charged with any crime immediately prior to or during the 55 days he was \nincarcerated between July 1 and August 25, 2014. (Id. at 4, No. 20.)  \n133. At a hearing before state court Judge Richard “Chip” Moore on September 23, 2014, \n“[s]everal Doctors testified and patient was returned back to the hospital for treatment.” \n(Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000024.) Judge Moore ordered George to remain at ELMHS and his \nplacement reviewed at a hearing scheduled for December 11, 2014. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 5, \nNo. 21.)  \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n134.  In making its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court has considered the record \nas a whole. The Court has observed the demeanor of witnesses and has carefully weighed \ntheir testimony and credibility in determining the facts of this case and drawing conclusions \nfrom those facts. All findings of fact contained in this ruling that are more appropriately \nconsidered conclusions of law are to be so deemed. Likewise, any conclusions of law more \nappropriately considered a finding of fact shall be so classified. \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 33 of 78\n135.  It is important at the outset of these findings to emphasize that the only relevant factual \nquestions are those which inform the issues in this case:   \na.  Did Defendants have in place policies, practices, or procedures causing or allowing \nNGRI acquittees to be arrested and incarcerated at a correctional facility solely for \na violation (or anticipated violation) of the conditions of the acquittee’s release, even \nwhen no crime had been committed? \nb.  Were George’s arrests or incarcerations made pursuant to this policy? \nc.  Even if there were no such policies, procedures or practices, under the specific facts \nof this case, did George’s arrests and subsequent incarcerations at a correctional \nfacility, solely because of a violation of his conditions of release, in the absence of \na criminal arrest, violate his substantive due process rights under the United States \nConstitution and/or his statutory rights under Section 504 and the ADA? \n136.  Thus, while the Court has considered and comments on other issues presented at trial, its \nconclusions and ruling are based only on those facts relevant to these issues. \nA.    JULY 29, 2013 ARREST AND INCARCERATION \n137.  At the time of the events sued upon, George was a person with a mental illness who had \nbeen found NGRI and was on conditional release subject to his abiding by the conditions \nset forth in a conditional release order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of the State \nof Louisiana. (Order, Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000001.) \n138.  From the time of his conditional release in 2009 until May 2014, George resided primarily \nin  group  homes  (known  more  technically  as  Intermediate  Care  Facilities  for  the \nDevelopmentally Disabled) but was occasionally admitted to private hospitals when his \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 34 of 78\nbehavior and need for medication adjustment warranted. (Trial Stipulations, Pl.’s Trial Ex. \n24, Trial Stipulation 4; Martinez Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, Doc. 148 at 35:4–21.) \n139.  Despite  being  hospitalized  in  May  2013,  George’s  aggressive  conduct  escalated  in \nfrequency and severity during May and June. On May 24, 2013, Brady submitted an episode \nreport to the state district court indicating that staff at Progressive Health Care had reported \nto him that George “had two episodes of verbal aggression and verbal threats within the last \ntwo (2) weeks to have one of his family members attack one of their direct care staff \nmembers.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 8 at 1; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 3 at 1.) \n140.  In this report, Brady also noted that, although George had been recently hospitalized for \napproximately two weeks at Beacon Behavioral Hospital in Lutcher, Louisiana, and had \nreceived a medication adjustment, “his behavior seemingly has escalated towards direct care \npersonnel.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 8 at 1; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 3 at 1.) \n141.  Because of George’s escalating behavior, Tubbs wrote Judge Richard “Chip” Moore on \nJune 10, 2013, to report his behavior and ask the court to “set a review hearing to address \nhis expiration date and violations.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 9 at TG000011; Defs.’ Trial Ex. 4 at \n0001; Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 75:1–9.) The Court never responded to this request. (Tubbs \nTest., Doc. 148 at 75:24–76:1.)  \n142.  Because of continued aggressive behavior in July, George was hospitalized from July 15 \nuntil July 25, 2013. (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5 at 1.) But despite this hospitalization, Brady felt \nGeorge’s medication was not working and felt something “wasn’t right” and that “the \nmedicine they adjusted wasn’t working for him.” (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 80:4–9.) \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 35 of 78\n143.  This concern was vindicated when “[o]n July 27, 2013, [George] told staff that he was going \nto do something to them if they did not bring him to get his hair cut. Then [he] told another \nclient he was going to kill them.” (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5 at 1.) Tubbs was told by staff at the \ngroup home that George assaulted or physically harmed a staff member. (Tubbs Test., Doc. \n148 at 79:2-14.) Although not noted in his records, the Court accepts this testimony as \ncredible. \n144.  While Tubbs testified that he arrested George even though George had committed no crime, \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 82), the evidence shows that George’s behavior was arguably \ncriminal. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 14:33, 35, 36, 38.  Indeed, Tubbs himself classified \nGeorge’s conduct as a “Level 3 violation – Misdemeanor activity (serious violent).” Tubbs \ncontinued, “[George] threatened staff and other clients with violence for the 3d [sic] time. \nThe group home wanted him out due to his behavior.” Tubbs classified his response to \nGeorge’s  conduct  as  “Level  3  Action  –  Arrest/Detain  with  Custodial  Treatment… \nWarrant/Motion and Order to Revoke.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000206–207.) \n145.  George’s conduct during these months reasonably led Defendants Tubbs, Brady, and \nVosburg to believe they had probable cause to arrest George for the violation or imminent \nviolation of his terms of conditional release, specifically, these two terms:  \na.  Any physically assaultive/aggressive behaviors shall be reported to \nthe  District  Forensic  Coordinator  or  State  Probation  Officer. \nViolations of this condition may result in immediate return to custody \nor intensified treatment if recommended by the District Forensic \nCoordinator or Probation Officer. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000002, \n¶ K; see also Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 1, No. 3.)  \n \nb.  It shall be a condition of every such probation that the person released \nshall be recommitted if he becomes dangerous to others or to himself \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 36 of 78\nfor reasons of his mental illness, substance abuse, or intellectual \ndisability. La. Code. Crim. Proc. art. 658(A). \n \n146.  In accordance with the policies, practices and procedures of both LADPSC and LDH (Tubbs \nTest., Doc. 148 at 84:17-20), after consultation with Vosburg and Brady (Brady Test. Doc. \n148 at 125:20-23), because they believed George had violated conditions of his release, \n(Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 121:24-122:1), and because they believed George presented a \ndanger to himself and others, (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 124:17-23), Tubbs effected George’s \narrest on July 29, 2013. \n147.  However, despite the requirement of La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B)(6) that the arrest of \nan acquittee be preceded by a motion of the court or District Attorney or probation officer, \nno such motion was filed, and no request was made to revoke George’s conditional release \nuntil August 12, 2013, 14 days after his arrest and incarceration, when Tubbs filed his \n“Detainer Notification, Affidavit of Probable Cause and Motion for Hearing to Revoke \nProbation.” (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5 at 1-2; Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000206.) \n148.   Despite the requirement of La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B)(6) that a hearing take place \n“immediately” following the arrest to “consider the violations listed . . . ,” there is no \nevidence in the record that such a hearing ever took place following George’s July 29, 2013, \narrest.  The hearing which occurred on August 23, 2013 was a response, not to a motion or \nrequest by state actors, but to Plaintiff’s petition for habeas corpus. \n149.  And although a warrantless arrest is authorized by La. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 658(B)(1) and \n899(B), there is no evidence in the record that the procedure required by these statutes was \nfollowed, i.e., that “a written report showing in what manner the defendant violated, or was \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 37 of 78\nabout to violate, a condition of his probation” was “immediately” submitted. Rather, that \nreport was not submitted until August 12, 2013. (Defs.’ Trial Ex. 5.) \n150.  The only evidence in the record regarding any contact with the court about George’s arrest \non the day of his arrest shows that Tubbs “[c]alled Judge Moore[’s] section and they got my \nletter [presumably, his letter of June 10, 2013] but no court date has been set as of today.” \n(Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000206.) \n151.   While not found in record evidence, Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint alleges it was \nhis counsel’s petition for habeas corpus that effected George’s August 23, 2013, release. \n(Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 42 at 14, ¶ 57.) Defendants agree George’s attorney \nfiled a petition for habeas corpus “which appears to have been filed the same day as the \nhearing. As a result of the hearing, Judge Chip Moore lifted the probation hold and ordered \nMr. George to continue mental health treatment.” (Doc. 161 at 6.) \n152.  Hope’s testimony shows that there was a court hearing on that day where she talked to the \njudge, “I guess off-the-record . . . .” (Hope Test., Doc. 149 at 192-93.) \n153.  Initially, Vosburg, Brady and Tubbs intended that, following his arrest, George be admitted \nto ELMHS. However, after inquiring, Brady was told that there was no bed available there. \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 86:13–24; Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 122:4–127:23.)  Brady also \ntestified, and the Court accepts this testimony as true, that during the entire period of \nGeorge’s 2013 incarceration, Brady continued to inquire as to the availability of a bed at \nELMHS but was told each time that there was none. (Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 127:1-22.)  \n154.  Tubbs testified that he did not attempt to get George admitted to a private hospital because \nhe felt he could not do so without an order of the Court. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 at 208:2–\n37 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 38 of 78\n211:5.) Unexplained in the record is how he was able to admit George to private hospitals, \nseemingly without a court order, on numerous previous occasions, including in May and \nJune  2013  and  on  August  23,  2013,  when  George  was  released  from  EBRPP  and \nimmediately admitted to Baton Rouge General Hospital. \n155.  Tubbs also said that he did not try to get George into a private hospital because, given the \nlevel of George’s aggressive conduct, ELMHS was the only facility that could handle \nPlaintiff at that time. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 at 208:2–24.)  However, this seems to be belied \nby Brady’s Episode Report of March 2010 to Judge Moore that, following similar conduct \nin May–July 2013,9 George was not placed in ELMHS nor was he arrested and incarcerated. \nRather, “[t]hey were able to transport him to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital for emergency \nevaluation. He was later transferred to Cypress Hospital for inpatient acute psychiatric \nhospitalization where he remains at this time.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 5.) Furthermore, Brady and \nTubbs were able to have George admitted to private hospitals in both May and July 2015, \nand, indeed on August 23, 2013, although his conduct during that time was similar to that \nwhich provoked his arrest and incarceration. \n156.  Tubbs stated in his deposition that he didn’t try to get George into a private hospital because \nsuch a hospital could not transport him to court “to address the violations of his conditions \nof probation.” (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 87:19–88:14.)  This assertion seems disingenuous \nat best since there is no evidence to suggest that LDPSC could not have arranged for such \ntransportation (Id. at 88:15–18) and, furthermore, Tubbs waited 14 days before moving the \ncourt for a hearing. \n                                                 \n9 George “shoved male staff[,] not causing physical harm;” threatened “homicidal ideations” [sic] towards staff \nmembers and “accused a male staff member of trying to poison him.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 5 at TG000006.) \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 39 of 78\n157.  In view of the many occasions in which Brady and Tubbs had been able to place George in \na private facility, Tubbs’ statement that such a facility would not likely have taken George \nbecause of concerns about their “ability to manage [him] from… a security standpoint” \n(Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 75:6–8; see also Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 at 208:2–24) is likewise \nsuspect. \n158.  On the other hand, Plaintiff offered no direct evidence that if Tubbs and Brady had tried to \nplace George in a private or other state hospital on July 29, 2013, they would have been \nsuccessful.  \nB.    ADEQUACY OF MEDICAL CARE AT EBRPP \n159.  The Court finds that while EBRPP provided some medical and psychiatric care for George \n(See, e.g. Burns Test., Doc. 149 at 106:13–25), this care was not comparable with the care \nhe would have received at ELMHS or a private hospital. \n160.  Indeed, there are important differences between the care available there and that available \nat ELMHS. \n161.   When George entered EBRPP, he was not allowed to bring his medicines with him and \nnew medicines needed to be ordered. This resulted in George being without his medicines \nfrom around July 31 until August 10, 2013. (Burns Test., Doc. 149 at 112:8–115:16, 119:1–\n18.) 10 \n162.   Furthermore, jails cannot force inmates to take medications. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at \n15:20–24.)  By  contrast,  ELMHS  is  “a  psychiatric  hospital  with  the  ability  to  force \nmedications on its patients.” (Id. at 19:8–10.)  \n                                                 \n10 In George’s case, the staff at Progressive attempted to bring him his medications on the date of his July 2013 arrest, \nbut “staff were turned around.” (Hope Test., Doc. 149 at 194:16.) \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 40 of 78\n163.   This resulted, for instance, in George receiving only a percentage of his medications while \nin EBRPP. Specifically, George received his Zantac only 46% of the time in the morning \nand 88% at night (Burns Test., Doc. 149 at 115:4–16); Depakote (a mood stabilizer) 8% in \nthe morning and 76% at night (Id. at 124:7–13); Cogentin (to treat side effects of anti-\npsychotic  drugs),  8%  in  the  morning  and  67%  at  night  (Id.  at  124:16–125:1);  and \nClonazepam (an anti-anxiety drug) 4% in the morning and 29 % at night. (Id. at 125:2–7.) \n164.  Furthermore, there were many services available at ELMHS not available at EBRPP. Kelly \ntestified that these services included, for instance, treatment track groups (probably a focus \ntrack) led by social workers. (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 103:1–21.) \n165.  While in EBRPP, George was relegated to solitary confinement for his own safety. (Brady \nTest., Doc. 149 at 14:5–11, 20:21–21:1–7.) ELMHS staff, on the other hand, would have \ngiven George “as much freedom as possible,” and he would have been allowed to interact \nwith the 20 other patients on the unit. (McConville Test., Doc. 149 at 163:11–164:13.) \n166.  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s condition worsened during his stay at EBRPP. While there \nwas some evidence that his condition was made permanently worse, the Court finds it \nunnecessary to decide this issue since Plaintiff’s claims for damages were dismissed.  \n167.  As to Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and Section 504, the jury found that Defendants had \nnot discriminated against George based on his disabilities or failed to provide him with a \nreasonable modification appropriate for his disabilities. (Doc. 144 at 1-2.) As is discussed \nin the Conclusions of Law section, under the standard the Court is bound to apply in \nevaluating these jury findings, the Court concludes that there was no error in either finding. \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 41 of 78\nC.    JULY 2014 ARREST AND INCARCERATION \n168.  At the time of George’s July 1, 2014, arrest, he was in the Acute Unit ward at ELMHS.  \n169.  Ironically, the dispute arose as George’s psychiatrist (Kelly) and psychologist (Vosburg) \nwere attempting to convince George to allow him to be transferred to a less restrictive unit.  \n170.  The Court finds that Kelly and Vosburg, both trained, knowledgeable and experienced with \npsychiatric patients generally, and with George specifically, reasonably felt physically \nthreatened by George. Kelly described the situation as follows: \nThey had to restrain him in the hallway and because of the threats he \nwas yelling at Dr. Vosburg in particular, we - - we - - I talked to one \nof the CGTS to escort Dr. Vosburg off the unit for his own protection. \nAnd at that point, I didn’t feel it was safe to leave Mr. George on our \nunit because I wasn’t just concerned about Dr. Vosburg, I was \nconcerned about my other civil patients on the unit that could be \nendangered by his, you know, behavior.  \n \n    (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 80:2-11.) \n171.  George’s probation officer was called and, although it was that officer’s decision to take \nhim to jail, Dr. Kelly stated that he could be moved into the Forensic Division if he had had \na bed but he told the officer “I doubted [] if they did.” (Kelly Test., Doc. 149 at 80:23-24.) \n172.  It appears that the probation officers who made this arrest were agents Bobby Castello and \n“Hooge,” not Defendants Tubbs or Brady. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000204; Brady Test., \nDoc. 149 at 18:22-19:7.) Plaintiff has not challenged the conduct of Castello and Hooge.   \n173.  The Court finds that there was reasonable and probable cause to believe that an emergency \nexisted such that awaiting a court order to arrest George would have created an undue risk \nto Kelly, Vosburg and other ELMHS staff and patients and to George himself. \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 42 of 78\n174.  Under  the  circumstances,  transfer  of  George  to  a  private  hospital  was  unnecessary, \nimpractical and unwise. \n175.  However, for reasons unclear in the record, no one notified the court about George’s arrest \nand incarceration or filed a written report or sought a hearing before the court to assess \nGeorge’s status until August 19, 2014. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000203.) \n176.  It wasn’t until August 22, 2014, that a hearing was held and on August 25, 2014, that George \nwas finally released back to ELMHS, 55 days after his arrest. (Id.) While Kelly testified he \n“doubted” there were any beds in the Forensic Unit on the date George was arrested (Kelly \nTest., Doc. 149 at 80:23-24), the record is unclear when a bed became available. \nD.    POLICY, PROCEDURE OR PRACTICE, VEL NON \n177.  Plaintiff correctly maintains (Pl.’s Request for Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law, Doc. \n151 at 11, ¶ 43) that the decision to arrest and incarcerate NGRI acquittees is generally made \njointly by employees of Defendants LDPSC and LDH. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 83:22–\n84:20; Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 93:20–94:8.) \n178.  But Plaintiff goes further, insisting that Defendants had a “practice and policy . . . to arrest \nand incarcerate individuals on conditional discharge who have violated a term of their \nconditional release.” (Pl.’s Request for Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law, Doc. 151 at \n10, ¶ 40) (citing Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 84:11 – 84:20.) \n179.   In support of its argument that such arrests are part of a policy, procedure and practice, \nPlaintiff points the Court (Pl.’s Request for Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law, Doc. 151 \nat 10, ¶ 40) to the testimony of Defendant Tubbs, where he states that “over the years, [he] \nmoved to revoke somewhere around 12 to 18 of the Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity folks \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 43 of 78\nthat [he] supervise[s]” and that, of those, most of them were taken to the New Orleans Parish \nPrison. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 84:21 – 85:3 (emphasis added).) \n180.  First, the Court notes that, in these other instances, unlike the two incidents complained of, \nthere was a motion to revoke the probation of the acquittee and, indeed, the conditional \ndischarges had been revoked. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 85:20-25.) \n181.  In  addition,  Plaintiff  offered  no  proof  as  to  the  specifics  of  the  other  arrests  and \nincarcerations, including whether the acquittees had committed a crime and, if not, the \nseriousness of the conduct that provoked the arrest and whether it involved physically \naggressive and assaultive behavior or a danger to the acquittee or others. In these important \nrespects, Plaintiff has failed to prove any policy, practice or procedure.11 \n182.  Plaintiff did establish that George’s July 29, 2013, arrest was “in accordance with [LDPSC] \ndepartmental policy.”  (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 84:17-20.) But the parameters of that policy \nwere not established, and the Court is left to conclude that the policy involved the arrest and \nincarceration not, as Plaintiff contends, of any NGRI acquittee solely because he has \nviolated any condition of release.  \n183.  Rather, if the policy, practice, and procedure mirrors the circumstances of George’s arrest \nand  initial  incarceration,  and  the  Court  so  finds,  then  it  allowed  for  the  arrest  and \nincarceration of an NGRI acquittee who has violated conditions of release prohibiting him \nfrom engaging in physically assaultive and aggressive behavior and presenting a danger to \nhimself and others. \n                                                 \n11 While not relevant to the Court’s decision, the Court also notes that there was no evidence as to how long the \nacquittees, in these other arrests and incarcerations remained incarcerated before a court hearing was held or how long \nthese individuals remained incarcerated before being released to ELMHS or other psychiatric facility. There was no \npolicy, practice or procedure demonstrated in this regard either. \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 44 of 78\n184.  The Court also notes that the arrest and incarceration of July 1, 2014, is, in some respects, \ndifferent than the July 29, 2013, arrest. The former involved aggressive behavior and an \narrest at a group home. The latter occurred at ELMHS. \n185.  As is discussed infra, the Court is troubled by the evidence indicating that, in one instance, \nGeorge was jailed for 25 days until his lawyer got him released pursuant to a habeas corpus \npetition and, in the other, 52 days before a hearing and a total of 55 days before he was \nreleased back to ELMHS.  But Plaintiff has made clear that “issues of length of incarceration \nbefore release [and] length of incarceration without or before a hearing” are not before the \nCourt. (Doc. 163; see also Doc. 42 at 2; 6, ¶¶ 14–17; 9, ¶ 30; and 23–24, ¶¶ 87–94.) But \neven if the length of George’s stay was an issue before the Court, these two instances do \nnot prove a policy, procedure, or practice.   \n186.  The Court is similarly troubled by the medical care George received at EBRPP which was \nincontestably inferior to that he would have received at ELMHS and appears to have done \nserious harm to George’s psychiatric condition. However, for similar reasons, this is not \nbefore the Court and, in any event, was not proven to be part of a policy, practice, or \nprocedure of the Defendants. \nE.   DISCRETE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS TO GEORGE, VEL NON \n187.  In addition to Plaintiff’s complaints about Defendants’ policies, procedures, and practices, \nPlaintiff claims “Defendants’ actions . . . which caused Plaintiff to be confined in a \ncorrectional facility for the sole reason that he is alleged to have violated a condition of his \nrelease, violate his rights under the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution.” \n(Doc. 42 at 19, ¶ 93.) \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 45 of 78\n188.  This substantive due process claim also challenges his arrest and incarceration for the “sole \nreason that he has violated a condition of his release,” (id.) without regard to the length or \ncircumstances of his extended incarceration or the quality of the medical care received there. \n(Doc. 163.) \n189.  In this regard, the Court finds that, on both occasions, George was arrested and removed \nfrom the group home because his aggressive behavior violated the terms of his conditions \nof release in that he was “physically assaultive and aggressive” and posed a danger to others. \nGeorge’s first incarceration at EBRPP was because Brady could not find a bed for him at \nELMHS. His second, by non-Defendant agents, was presumably for a similar reason, i.e., \nthere were no beds in the Forensic Unit where George otherwise would have been placed. \n190.  As with the Court’s previous finding regarding Plaintiff’s charge of an unconditional policy, \npractice or procedure, the Court finds that George’s arrest was not for his violation of “any” \ncondition of his release but, importantly, because his behavior presented a danger to  others. \n191.  The Court finds that Tubbs, Brady and Vosburg had reasonable and probable cause to \nbelieve that, for this reason, George had violated and was likely to continue to violate those \nspecific conditions of his release. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n \nA.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n192.  George is properly represented in this matter by his niece and guardian ad litem, Letetica \nWalker, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 17(b)(1) and 17(c)(2) and the laws of \nLouisiana governing competency. (Memo. in Support of Mot. to Appoint Guardian ad \nLitem, Doc. 58-1, in globo; Order Granting Motion, Doc. 63, in globo.) \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 46 of 78\n193.  Both are residents of Louisiana. Plaintiff is suing Defendants for claims arising under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Section 504, \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a); and Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Defendants are state \nagencies and their officers.  Thus, this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  \n194.  George is seeking declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202 and prospective injunctive \nrelief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n195.  Venue in the Middle District of Louisiana is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2). \n196.  George’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are justiciable under Article III of the \nConstitution since they allege facts which raise the issue of whether the alleged violations \nof George’s due process rights are “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” Catholic \nLeadership Coal.

ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT \n198.  As the Court has stated twice previously, following Plaintiff’s dismissal of his Section 1983 \ndamages claims and the Court’s ruling on Plaintiff’s facial constitutional challenge to La. \nCode Crim. Proc. arts. 658 and 899 (Doc. 124 at 3, 22-26), the constitutional issues in this \naction are narrowly limited to whether George’s arrest and subsequent incarceration for \nviolations of his release, in the absence of a criminal arrest, violated his constitutional right \nto due process. \nD.    STATUTORY RIGHTS OF THOSE FOUND NOT \nGUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY \n \n199.  Louisiana Revised Statute 14:14 states that an individual charged with a criminal offense is \nexempt from criminal responsibility for his behavior, and is thus not guilty by reason of \ninsanity, when “the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease or mental defect \nthe offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the \nconduct in question.”    \n200.  Louisiana Revised Statute 28:2(20) defines a mentally ill person as “any person with a \npsychiatric disorder which has substantial adverse effects on his ability to function and who \nrequires care and treatment.”  \n201.  The statutory structure under which George was twice arrested and detained is found in La. \nCode Crim. Proc. arts. 654-658 and 899. A summary of those articles pertinent to the issues \nbefore the Court follows. \n202.  La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 654 provides that if the defendant is found NGRI in a non-capital \ncase, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a private mental institution approved \nby the court and “promptly hold a contradictory hearing” to determine whether he is a \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 48 of 78\ndanger to himself or others and therefore whether he can be released, with or without \nconditions, or must remain committed in the mental institution. \n203.  Specifically, art. 654 provides, in pertinent part: “If the court determines that the defendant \ncan be discharged or released on probation without danger to others or to himself, the court \nshall either order his discharge, or order his release on probation subject to specified \nconditions for a fixed or an indeterminate period.”  \n204.  Louisiana Revised Statute 28:2(6) defines “dangerous to others” as “the condition of a \nperson whose behavior or significant threats support a reasonable expectation that there is \na substantial risk that he will inflict physical harm upon another person in the near future.” \nLouisiana Revised Statute 28:2(7) defines “dangerous to self” as “the condition of a person \nwhose behavior, significant threats or inaction supports a reasonable expectation that there \nis a substantial risk that he will inflict physical or severe emotional harm upon his own \nperson.”  \n205.  In ordering a conditional release from a mental health facility, the court “shall subject a \nconditionally released insanity acquittee to such orders and conditions it deems will best \nmeet the acquittee’s need for treatment, supervision, and monitoring and will best serve the \ninterests of justice and society.” La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 657.1(B). \n206.  The  acquittee  on  probation  (also  known  as  the  “probationer”)  “shall  be  under  the \nsupervision of the division of probation and parole.” La. Code Crim. Proc. art 658(B)(1).  \n207.  In this case, George was released on specified conditions, which were in place at the time \nof both arrests and detentions in the EBRPP. Especially important in this case is the \nfollowing condition:  \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 49 of 78\nAny  physically  assaultive/aggressive  behaviors  shall  be  reported  to  the \nDistrict Forensic Coordinator or State Probation Officer. Violations of this \ncondition may result in immediate return to custody or intensified treatment \nif recommended by the District Forensic Coordinator and State Probation \nOfficer. \n \n(Pl.’s Trial Ex. 1 at TG000002.) \n \n208.  In addition to whatever specific conditions are placed by the court, “[i]t shall be a condition \nof every such probation that the person released shall be recommitted if he becomes \ndangerous to others or to himself for reasons of mental illness . . . ” La. Code Crim. Proc. \nart. 658(A) (emphasis added). \n209.  Also of importance in this case is the following provision: “When the probationer violates \nor is about to violate the conditions of his probation, he may be arrested and detained in \nconformity with the applicable provisions of Article 899 of this Code.” La. Code Crim. \nProc. art. 658(B)(1).12 \n210.  La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 899(B) states, in pertinent part: “If a probation officer has \nreasonable cause to believe that a [probationer] has violated or is about to violate a condition \nof his probation or that an emergency exists so that awaiting an order of the court would \ncreate an undue risk to the public or the probationer, the probation officer may arrest the \n[probationer] without a warrant . . . . The probation officer shall immediately notify the \nproper court of the arrest and shall submit a written report showing what manner the \n[probationer] violated, or was about to violate, a condition of his probation.”  \n                                                 \n12 This Court has previously held in this matter that neither La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B) nor La. Code Crim. Proc. \nart. 899 are unconstitutional on their face. (See Doc. 124 at 22-24.)  \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 50 of 78\n211.  La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 899(E) provides, in pertinent part: “Within ten days following the \narrest of [a probationer] pursuant to the provisions of this Article, the Court shall determine \nif there is probable cause to detain him pending a final violation hearing . . . ”  \n212.  Presumably designed to work in conjunction with art. 658(B)(1), La. Code Crim. Proc. art. \n658(B)(5) provides:  \nThe division of probation and parole or the Louisiana Department of Health \nthrough the conditional release program coordinator or a designee shall \nimmediately notify the court of any substantive violations or imminent \nviolations of the conditions of the person’s probated release and shall present \nrecommendations to the court regarding whether the court should revoke the \nprobation and recommit the probationer to a state mental institution or other \nrecommendations as may be appropriate. \n \n213.  Upon receiving the report recommending revocation or other disposition, the court may, on \nits own motion or that of the District Attorney or probation officer, “cause the person to be \narrested, if he is not already in custody, and shall immediately hold a hearing to consider \nthe violations listed . . . ” La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B)(6).  \n214.  If the court determines that there has been a violation of a term of the conditional release or \nthat the acquittee was about to violate the conditions of release, it may do any of the \nfollowing:  \n(1)   Reprimand and warn the probationer; \n \n(2)   Order that supervision be intensified; \n \n(3)   Modify or add additional conditions to the probation; \n \n(4)   Revoke the probation and recommit the probationer to a state mental \ninstitution,  subject  to  consideration  for  discharge  or  release  on \nprobation only after one year has elapsed from the date of revocation \nand in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Articles 655 \nthrough 657 for a first application and hearing.  \n \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 51 of 78\nLa. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(C).  \n \n215.  Although art. 658(C) does not list as one of its options the arrest and incarceration of the \nacquittee,  art.  658(B)(1)  specifically  authorizes  the  arrest  and  detention  of  the \nprobationer/acquittee in conformity with art. 899 “[w]hen the probationer violates or is \nabout to violate the conditions of his probation.” Art. 899, as mentioned above, authorizes \nthe arrest of a probationer without a warrant if the probation officer “has reasonable cause \nto believe that a [probationer] has violated or is about to violate a condition of his \nprobation.” \n216.  Louisiana’s statutory scheme  also envisions a situation where  (without  mention  of  a \nviolation or imminent violation of conditions of release), the probationer/acquittee “is in \nneed of acute, i.e. short term, hospitalization and is not charged with a new criminal offense \n. . .” La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B)(4). In such a circumstance, he “may be voluntarily \nadmitted pursuant to R.S. 28:52 or admitted by emergency certificate pursuant to R.S. 28:53 \nto the Feleciana Forensic Facility or to another suitable treatment facility, with subsequent \nnotice to the court.”   \n217.  While  Plaintiff  argues  that  this  provision  could  have  been  utilized  where  the \nprobationer/acquittee violated or was about to violate his terms of supervised released (P \nBrief, Doc. 151, ¶ 128), the provision does not explicitly state this. \nE.    SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF NGRI ACQUITTEES \nAND STANDARD FOR APPLYING THEM \n \n218.  In  addition  to  its  procedural  protections,  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  “contains  a  substantive  component  that  bars  certain  arbitrary,  wrongful \ngovernment actions” that deprive a person of life, liberty, or property “‘regardless of the \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 52 of 78\nfairness of the procedures used to implement them.’” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 \n(1992) (quoting Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990)). \n219.  Among the liberty interests protected by this substantive portion of the Due Process Clause \nare certain fundamental rights such as the freedom from confinement or bodily restraint, \nwhich “has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from \narbitrary action.”  Id. \n220.  A finding of NGRI means that the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the defendant was insane at the time the acts were committed and thus cannot be \npunished for such acts.  Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 369 (1983).   \n221.  On the other hand, this does not mean that the NGRI acquittee is free to resume his life \nunfettered by any restrictions. Society has an interest in insuring that an insanity acquittee \nposes no danger to himself or the public.  Id. at 368. \n222.  “[T]he governing legal principle derived from Foucha and Jones is that a state may continue \nto confine an insanity acquittee only as long as the acquittee is both mentally ill and \ndangerous.” Poree v. Collins, 866 F.3d 235, 248 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Jones, 463 U.S. at \n368-70; Foucha, 504 U.S. at 77-78).  \n223.  Stated another way, “[t]ogether, Jones and Foucha establish that the state must prove two \nconditions to justify continued confinement of an NGRI acquittee: mental illness and \ndangerousness.” Id. \n224.  Regardless of the purpose of confinement, however, the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nrecognized that “commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty \nthat requires due process protection.” Jones, 463 U.S. at 361. See also Addington v. Texas, \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 53 of 78\n441 U.S. 418 (1979); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972); Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. \n504 (1972); Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605 (1967). \n225.  In the case of an NGRI acquittee, constitutionally permissible purposes for confinement \ninclude treating the mental illness and protecting the acquittee and society from his potential \ndangerousness. Jones, 463 U.S. at 368 (emphasis added). \n226.  While “the Supreme Court has not provided any yardstick for determining what probability \nof danger is sufficient [to satisfy the substantive due process standard for confinement] and \nthat which falls short[,]” Poree, 866 F.3d at 249, the Fifth Circuit has approved of a \nLouisiana state court’s continued confinement of an NGRI acquittee based on his “potential \nfor both danger to himself and others,” coupled with a finding of his mental illness, holding \nsuch confinement was not contrary to clearly established federal law.  Id. at 249-251.13 \n227.  In delineating the boundaries of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process protections for \nNGRI acquittees, courts have often looked to the protections given to individuals who have \nbeen civilly committed or to pretrial detainees.  See e.g., Poree, 866 F.3d at 244-245 & n.31.  \n(also observing that Louisiana’s statutory scheme “likens conditional release [of an NGRI \nacquittee] to probation.”). And there is reason for this favorable comparison since an NGRI \nacquittee, like a pretrial detainee or one civilly committed, has not been found legally \nresponsible for the commission of a crime. \n228.  But there are important differences too. As stated by the District Court’s decision in Poree: \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  also  recognized  that  different  considerations \nunderlie  the  commitment  of  insanity  acquittees,  holding  that  “insanity \n                                                 \n13 While not determinative in this case, the Fifth Circuit in Poree felt “compelled to note” that Louisiana’s statutory \nrequirement that confinement is justified only when there is a “reasonable expectation that there is a substantial risk” \nthat the acquittee will cause harm, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 28:2(3) and (4), is a more demanding standard than that \napplied by the state court and approved of by the Fifth Circuit. 866 F.3d at 249-50. \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 54 of 78\nacquittees constitute a special class that should be treated differently from \nother candidates for commitment.” Jones, 463 U.S. [at] 370. For example, \n“the fact that a person has been found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have \ncommitted a criminal act certainly indicates dangerousness.” Id. at 364 \n(citing Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 714 (1962) (that the accused was \nfound to have committed a criminal act is “strong evidence that his continued \nliberty could imperil ‘the preservation of the peace’ ”). The Court has also \nindicated that concrete evidence that an individual committed a crime is “at \nleast as persuasive as any predictions about dangerousness that might be \nmade in a civil-commitment proceeding.” Jones, 463 U.S. at 364–65. \n \nAdditionally, the U.S. Fifth Circuit has indicated that, although insanity \nacquittees  are  entitled  to  substantially  the  same  procedural  protections \nafforded civil committees, insanity acquittees can be viewed differently \nwhen being considered for release since the “prior antisocial conduct of an \ninsanity acquittee justifies treating such a person differently ...” Powell v. \nFlorida, 579 F.2d 324, 333 (5th Cir. 1978). See also, Warren v. Harvey, 632 \nF.2d 925, 931 (2nd Cir. 1980) (that insanity acquittees have been found, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act indicates they \nhave “proved themselves a danger to society at one time”). \n \nPoree v. Kollins, 2014 WL 346081 at *8 (E.D. La. Jan. 29, 2014), aff’d. 866 F.3d 235 (5th \nCir. 2017). \n229.  On the issue of the legal standard by which to measure the alleged due process breach in \nthis case, Plaintiff argues that “[t]he closest analogue to the liberty interests of NGRI \nacquittees arises in the civil commitment context.” (Doc. 151,  ¶ 133) (citing Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982) (finding a liberty interest in adequate medical care and \ntreatment for the intellectually disabled); Savidge v. Fincannon, 836 F.2d 898 (5th Cir. \n1988) (tracing the constitutional right to treatment); Welsch v. Likins, 373 F. Supp. 487, \n491–500 (D. Minn. 1974), supplemented, 68 F.R.D. 589 (D. Minn. 1975), aff’d, 525 F.2d \n987 (8th Cir. 1975)).  \n230.  As such, argues Plaintiff, the standard of review for violations of the substantive due process \nrights of NGRI acquittees is distinct from the “deliberate indifference” standard that the \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 55 of 78\nSupreme Court has applied to certain government actions.  (P Brief, Doc. 151, ¶ 145.) \nRather, the proper test involves balancing the individual’s liberty interests against the \nlegitimate interests of the state.  (Doc. 151, ¶¶ 147, 149) (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324; \nJones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918 (9th Cir. 2004)).   \n231.  Plaintiff contends that, to properly apply the Youngberg balancing test, this Court should \nuse a “least-restrictive-means analysis” as was used by the Eleventh Circuit in Lynch v. \nBaxley, 744 F.2d 1452 (11th Cir. 1984), which ruled that, while state and local governments \nhad a compelling interest in safety of the individual and society, they must confine those \nawaiting civil commitments in the least restrictive setting, i.e., in a public or private hospital \ninstead of county jails. (Doc. 151, ¶¶ 132, 148) (citing Lynch, 744 F.2d at 1457-61). \n232.  Plaintiff points to the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Jones v. Blanas for the proposition that \n“[w]ith respect to an individual confined awaiting adjudication under civil process, a \npresumption of punitive conditions arises where the individual is detained under conditions \nidentical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those under which pretrial criminal detainees \nare held, or where the individual is detained under conditions more restrictive than those he \nor she would face upon commitment.” (P Brief, Doc. 151, ¶ 150) (citing Jones, 393 F.3d at \n934). \n233.  Plaintiff also urges the Court to look to similar due process considerations which arise in \nthe criminal context during incompetency proceedings, citing Or. Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, \n322 F.3d 1101, 1121–22 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[h]olding incapacitated criminal defendants in \njail for weeks or months violates their due process rights because the nature and duration of \ntheir incarceration bears no reasonable relation to the evaluative and restorative purposes \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 56 of 78\nfor which courts commit those individuals”); Trueblood v. Wash. State Dep’t of Social and \nHealth Svcs., 101 F. Supp. 3d 1010 (W.D. Wash. 2015), rev’d on other grounds, 2016 WL \n2610233 (9th Cir. 2016); and Terry ex rel. Terry v. Hill, 232 F. Supp. 2d 934 (E.D. Ark. \n2002). In these cases, argues Plaintiff, pretrial detainees awaiting competency restoration \nservices have a liberty interest in proper mental health treatment to restore their competency. \n(P Brief, Doc. 151, ¶ 135.)  \n234.  In these cases, courts have held state actors to a higher standard than a mere general \n“deliberate  indifference”  standard,  instead  conducting  a  balancing  test  between  an \nincompetent detainee’s liberty interests in freedom and restorative treatment versus the \ninterests of the state. See Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738 (balancing nature and duration of \nconfinement with care and treatment); Mink, 322 F.3d at 1121 n.11 (declining to rely solely \non a deliberate indifference standard and instead balancing incompetent detainees’ liberty \ninterests in freedom and restorative treatment against state interests because “substantive \ndue process may demand more than a lack of deliberate indifference”); Terry, 232 F. Supp. \n2d at 943–44 (balancing state interests against incompetent pretrial detainees’ interests in \ntreatment and freedom and noting, in the alternative, that the failure to provide restorative \ntreatment was deliberate indifference by the state agency). \n235.  But even if this Court should use the deliberate indifference standard, Plaintiff urges the \nCourt in the alternative to apply an objective standard in doing so, citing Kingsley v. \nHendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 (2015). And while Kingsley did not hold this objective \nstandard  applicable  to  all  substantive  due  process  claims,  Plaintiff  asks  this  Court \nalternatively to adopt the Kingsley standard in this case, citing the Ninth Circuit’s decision \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 57 of 78\nin Castro v. County of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc), which \nexpanded the Kingsley standard to include failure-to-provide-medical-care  claims  and \nsuggested  that  the  standard  should  also  be  applied  to  other  substantive  due  process \nconfinement claims. (Doc. 151, ¶ 158.) \n236.  Defendants  have  not  provided  the  Court  with  their  position  regarding  the  applicable \nstandard by which to measure a due process violation, arguing only that there is limited due \nprocess protection for a probationer in the revocation process. (D Brief, Doc. 152, ¶ 93) \n(citing Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 \n(1973); Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U.S. 357 (1998)).  \n237.  In  this  regard,  Defendants  point  the  Court  to  the  following  excerpt  from  Griffin  v. \nWisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 874 (1987): “[I]t is always true of probationers (as we have said \nit to be true of parolees) that they do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is \nentitled, but only . . .  conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special \n[probation] restrictions.” (internal quotation marks omitted). (Doc. 152, ¶ 95.)  \n238.  Rather, Defendants focus their argument on George’s arrest, contending it was statutorily \npermitted and constitutional. (Doc. 152, ¶¶ 96-100.) Defendants do not address the broader \nissue of the legal basis justifying their failure to place (and replace) George in ELMHS or \nhis prolonged stays in EBRPP without a hearing.14 \n239.  In deciding the proper standard to apply, the Court starts with the foundational proposition \nthat the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process guarantee protects citizens from \n                                                 \n14 Defendants suggest they haven’t done so because Plaintiff’s claim tried to the Court was limited to the sole issue of \nwhether declaratory and injunctive is justified based on the alleged unconstitutional policies, practices and procedures \nof Defendants in arresting and incarcerating NGRI acquittees for violations of conditions of release alone, when no \ncrime has been committed. (Doc. 161 at 1-2, 9-10.) This contention was repeated in oral argument. \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 58 of 78\narbitrary, abusive, or oppressive use of governmental power. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. \n327, 332 (1986). \n240.  In assessing whether a confinement violates the specific substantive due process rights of \nNGRI acquittees, the Supreme Court has held that “[d]ue process requires that the nature of \nthe commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is \ncommitted.” Foucha, 504 U.S. at 79 (citing Jones, 463 U.S. at 715; Jackson, 406 U.S. at \n738). \n241.  This test is essentially identical to the substantive due process standard previously set by \nthe Supreme Court in Youngberg for mentally retarded persons involuntarily committed: \n“In determining whether a substantive right protected by the Due Process Clause has been \nviolated, it is necessary to balance ‘the liberty of the individual’ and ‘the demands of an \norganized society.’” Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320 (quoting Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S 497, 542 \n(1961) (Harlan, J. dissenting)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit has likened the substantive due \nprocess rights of one mentally ill who has been civilly committed to those of an NGRI \nacquittee.  See Poree, 866 F.3d at 244-245. \n242.  As discussed in Youngberg and numerous subsequent cases, a court generally evaluates \nsubstantive due process challenges by pretrial detainees as follows:  \n[I]f a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably \nrelated to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, \namount to ‘punishment.’ Conversely, if a restriction or condition is not \nreasonably related to a legitimate goal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a \ncourt permissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is \npunishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua \ndetainees.   \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 59 of 78\nSee, e.g., Estate of Henson v. Wichita Cty., 795 F.3d 456, 467 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 539 (1979)). \n243.  The Court therefore believes Youngberg and its progeny are particularly instructive in \nevaluating the substantive due process issues in this case. \n244.  Youngberg held that “adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care” are “essentials of \nthe care that the State must provide.” 457 U.S. at 324, see also id. at 315. \n245.  However, as later cases observe, “this is by no means the same as requiring the State to \nprovide the best care possible or the optimum location to improve the client’s physical, \nmental and emotional conditions.” Lelsz v. Kavanaugh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1251 (5th Cir. \n1987), rehg. denied, 815 F.2d 1034, cert. dismissed, 483 U.S. 1057 (1987). \n246.  But Youngberg tells us that “[mentally ill] [p]ersons who have been involuntarily committed \nare entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals \nwhose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.” 457 U.S. at 322. \n247.  In  Youngberg,  the  Court  rejected  the  state’s  argument  that  the  Eighth  Amendment \nsubjective deliberate indifference or criminal recklessness standard should govern the due \nprocess rights of those who were civilly, as opposed to criminally, committed.  Id. at 321-\n22, 325. \n248.  However, Youngberg also observed that the balancing of liberty and state interests required \nshould not be left to the “unguided discretion” of a judge or jury.  Id. at 321. \n249.  The Youngberg court decided that an official violates the substantive due process rights of \na mentally ill civilly committed individual when his decision injures the individual’s liberty \ninterests and constitutes a “substantial departure from accepted professional judgment.”  Id. \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 60 of 78\nat 323-24.  Indeed, the Court ruled that “[l]iability may be imposed only when the decision \nby the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, \npractice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the \ndecision on such a judgment.”  Id. at 323.  Therefore, in weighing a committed individual’s \nliberty  interests  against  unreasonable  restraints,  a  court  must  show  deference  to  the \njudgment exercised by a qualified professional, which is entitled to a presumption of \ncorrectness.  Id. at 322, 324.  \n250.  Youngberg also noted that, “[i]n an action for damages against a professional in his \nindividual capacity, . . . the professional will not be liable if he was unable to satisfy his \nnormal professional standards because of budgetary constraints; in such a situation, good \nfaith immunity would bar liability.”  Id. at 323. \n251.  This principle does not necessarily bar the grant of prospective injunctive or declaratory \nrelief to remedy unconstitutional conditions or policies.  See Thomas S. By Brooks v. \nMorrow, 601 F. Supp. 1055, 1059-60 (W.D.N.C. 1984) (“Lack of funding or of established \nalternatives  is  not  a  factor  which  may  be  considered  in  determining  the  scope  of \n[constitutional  rights  analyzed  in  Youngberg].  Of  course,  that  factor  is  critical  in \ndetermining whether damages may be recovered by one who was denied his right to \nappropriate treatment . . . . Nor are budgetary constraints restrictive of a court’s equitable \nauthority  and  power  in  fashioning  prospective  relief  after  determining  that  this \nconstitutional right has been violated.” (emphasis in original)).  See also Udey v. Kastner, \n805 F.2d 1218, 1220 (5th Cir. 1986) (“[I]nadequate resources can never be an adequate \njustification  for  depriving  any  person  of  his  constitutional  rights.”  (quoting  Smith  v. \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 61 of 78\nSullivan, 553 F.2d 373, 378 (5th Cir. 1977)); Scott v. Plante, 691 F.2d 632, 637 (3rd Cir. \n1982) (“Obviously the problem of hindsight interference with decisions made by hard-\npressed professional staff members of state mental institutions is a more serious one than \nthat of assisting them in directing prospective injunctive relief against appropriate state \nofficials.”); Birrell v. Brown, 867 F.2d 956, 959 (6th Cir. 1989) (“In Youngberg, however, \nthe Court indicated that budgetary constraints could cloak an individual with good-faith \nimmunity. . . . Such immunity based on budgetary constraints does not, of course, excuse \nthe constitutional violations themselves, or prevent court orders that require the government \nto correct deficiencies.”). \n252.  Youngberg defined a “professional” as someone “competent, whether by education, training \nor  experience  to  make  the  particular  decision  at  issue.”  457  U.S.  at  323  n.30.    It \ndistinguished “employees without formal training but who are subject to the supervision of \nqualified persons,” and who would make “day-to-day decisions regarding care.”  Id.; see \nalso Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir. 2000) (defendant “direct care” \nworkers were nonprofessionals whose primary responsibility was carrying out the directions \nof officials who determine patient care; conversely, in Youngberg defendant directors \nexercised “varying degrees of supervisory authority over the treatment provided to the \npatient”);  cf. Patten v. Nichols, 274 F.3d 829, 840 (4th Cir. 2001) (“Youngberg clearly \nestablishes that a hospital’s obligation to protect the safety of its patients is measured by the \nprofessional judgment standard, and there is no reason to think that the hospital generally \nwill attend to its obligation to provide medical care under circumstances substantially \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 62 of 78\ndifferent from those under which the hospital attends to its obligation to protect the patient’s \nsafety.”). \n253.  Sixteen years after Youngberg, the Supreme Court decided County of Sacramento v. Lewis, \n523 U.S. 833 (1998). Unlike Youngberg, Lewis involved the alleged reckless conduct of a \ndeputy sheriff who instigated a high speed chase that led to a death.  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 836-\n37.  The decedent’s estate sued the county, sheriff’s department, and deputy, alleging \ndeprivation of the decedent’s substantive due process right to life.  Id. at 837. \n254.  In determining what standard to apply, the Court emphasized that a cognizable substantive \ndue process claim must allege official conduct that “shocks the conscience.”  Id. at 846.  \nThe Court also observed that negligent conduct would not give rise to a due process claim, \nwhile conduct “intended to injure” and unjustified by any government interest would.  Id. \nat 848-49. \n255.  The  Court  observed  that,  for  conduct  falling  between  those  extremes,  “deliberate \nindifference” would satisfy the fault requirement for due process claims, whether brought \nby convicted prisoners or someone jailed and awaiting trial.  Id. at 849-50.   \n256.  The Court noted, however, that “[d]eliberate indifference that shocks in one environment \nmay not be so patently egregious in another,” and that the term “deliberate indifference” \nimplies a standard “sensibly employed only when actual deliberation is practical.”  Id. at \n850-51.  Emphasizing the need for “fast action” and the balancing of multiple conflicting \nduties, id. at 853, the Court held that, absent a “purpose to cause harm,” officer actions \nduring a high-speed chase do not give rise to a due process violation.  Id. at 854.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 63 of 78\n257.  In reaching its holding, the Court distinguished “the custodial situation of a prison,” where \ndeliberation was not only “practical” and “feasible” but also “obligatory under a regime that \nincapacitates a prisoner to exercise ordinary responsibility for his own welfare.”  Id. at 851.  \nThe Court observed that the situation in Youngberg could be categorized on “much the same \nterms,”  as  “[t]he  combination  of  a  patient’s  involuntary  commitment  and  his  total \ndependence on his custodians obliges the government to take thought and make reasonable \nprovision for the patient’s welfare.”  Id. at 852 n.12. \n258.  More recently, the Fifth Circuit has stated that a pretrial detainee’s Section 1983 action \nbased on “episodic acts or omissions” in violation of Fourteenth Amendment rights must \nshow subjective deliberate indifference, i.e., that an official “knew of and disregarded a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm.”  Alderson v. Concordia Par. Corr. Facility, 848 F.3d 415, \n419-20 (5th Cir. 2017).  Official conduct must be “wanton” or “reckless” to meet this \nstandard; “inept, erroneous, ineffective, or negligent” conduct does not suffice.  Id. at 420. \n259.  Several district courts have also applied Youngberg, Foucha, Jones, and related cases in \ncircumstances similar to those presented here.  In Ward v. Hellerstedt, 2017 WL 1611761 \n(W.D. Tex., April 28, 2017), the Western District of Texas considered claims that NGRI \nacquittees were “languish[ing] in a jail setting for months on end with no treatment or \nevaluation,” violating their interests in “freedom from incarceration” and “the receipt of \nrestorative treatment.”  Id. at *2.  The court observed that, with respect to NGRI acquittees, \nJones and Foucha state that the purpose of an insanity acquittee’s commitment is dual: \n“treatment and protection of society.”  Id. at *4.  The court also noted that “continued \ndetention based on dangerousness and mental illness is only constitutional when there has \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 64 of 78\nbeen a sufficiently prompt full adversarial hearing where the State has proven by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the individual is demonstrably dangerous to the community.”  Id. \n260.  In Luna v. Van Zandt, 554 F. Supp. 68 (S.D. Tex. 1982), the Southern District of Texas \nconsidered the constitutionality of a protective custody statute which, according to the \nplaintiff, permitted “involuntary detention without a probable cause hearing” and without \n“provid[ing] notice of the grounds and authority authorizing protective custody.”  Id. at 71.  \n261.  The court ruled that individuals may be detained absent prior notice and opportunity for a \nhearing in “extraordinary situations;” the statute at issue was constitutional in this respect \nbecause it permitted the detention of individuals “who allegedly pose an immediate threat \nof harm to self, others, or society.”  Id. at 72.   \n262.  However, the court determined that the statutory scheme requiring detainees to wait 14 days \nor longer for a preliminary “probable cause hearing” was unconstitutional.  Id. at 72-73, 75-\n76.   \n263.  According to the court, “[t]he threat of immediate harm to self or others clearly justifies the \ninitial detention. Once the proposed patient is rendered secure and is placed under custody, \nhowever, this immediate threat of harm dissipates. His continued confinement can no longer \nbe justified on that basis.”  Id. at 72-73.  In other words, after the individual had been \n“secured,” a hearing was necessary in order to ensure that the nature of the commitment \ncontinued to bear some reasonable relationship to the purpose for which the individual \nremained committed.  See id. \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 65 of 78\n264.  In Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (D. Colo. 2002), the District of Colorado \nattempted to reconcile Youngberg’s balancing and professional judgment standard with the \ngeneral standards discussed in Lewis and its progeny.  Id. at 1149-51.   \n265.  The court observed that a person’s substantive due process rights are violated by the \n“arbitrary, abusive, or oppressive use of governmental power,” i.e., “egregious” conduct \nthat “shocks the conscience.”  Id. at 1149 (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846).  \n266.  According to Neiberger, when a plaintiff alleges conduct that is worse than negligent but \nnot intentional, Lewis “directs the inquiry to the official’s opportunity for deliberation.”  Id. \n(citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850-55).   \n267.  In cases involving individuals not committed for punishment, Neiberger also rejects the \ngeneral Eighth Amendment “deliberate indifference” standard in favor of the Youngberg \nstandard.  Id. at 1149.  As Neiberger observes, the individuals in Youngberg merited \n“greater constitutional vigilance from their caretakers than . . . ordinary prisoners,” but \nYoungberg was also wary “of placing too onerous a burden on these officials.”  Id. at 1150 \n(citing Shaw by Strain v. Strackhouse, 920 F.2d 1135, 1144-45 (3d Cir. 1990)). \n268.  In  Neiberger’s  view,  Youngberg’s  “professional  judgment”  standard  constituted  a \n“middle[]ground” between a very deferential “deliberate indifference” standard and more \nsearching “compelling” or “substantial necessity” tests.  See id. (citing Shaw, 920 F.2d at \n1145). \n269.  Youngberg and its progeny remain good law.  Moreover, as discussed above, these cases \naccount for numerous factors that are unique or particularly relevant to decisions made \nabout the care and detention of NGRI individuals, namely (1) their placement in state \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 66 of 78\ncustody and resulting inability to provide for their own wellbeing; (2) the fact that they have \nnot been found legally responsible for criminal conduct and have a greater liberty interest \nthan an individual convicted of a crime; (3) their typical placement with individuals who \nreceive  training  and  exercise  informed,  professional  judgment  about  their  care;  and \n(4) officials’ general ability to make deliberate, unhurried decisions about their care. \n270.  The Court is therefore persuaded, at least as an initial matter, to use Youngberg’s balancing \nand professional judgment standards to determine whether Defendants’ conduct “shocks the \nconscience,” as is required to give rise to a due process claim. \n271.  Because  there  is  a  reasonable  argument,  however,  that  one  of  the  aforementioned \n“deliberate indifference” standards applies, the court will also consider the application of \nthese standards in the alternative.  See, e.g., Terry, 232 F. Supp. 2d at 943-44 (balancing \nstate interests against incompetent pretrial detainees’ interests in treatment and freedom and \nnoting, in the alternative, that the failure to provide restorative treatment was deliberate \nindifference by the state agency). \n           F.    APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS OF CASE \n272.  The Court will address each issue separately. \nG.    EXISTENCE AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ALLEGED \nPOLICY, PRACTICE, AND PROCEDURE \n \n273.  Plaintiff’s  central  argument  is  that  Defendants  maintained  a  “policy,  practice  and \nprocedure” of arresting and incarcerating NGRI acquittees for violating their conditions of \nrelease when no crime had been committed. (Doc. 42, ¶¶ 1, 77, 78, 80, 86, 91, 93-94.) He \nargues that a policy has been proven primarily by two facts: first, the two incidents in which \nGeorge himself was arrested and incarcerated; and second, the testimony of Tubbs that there \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 67 of 78\nwere some 12 to 18 other incidents in which Tubbs arrested and incarcerated NGRI \nacquittees. He also attempts to support his argument by maintaining that Defendants \n“haven’t claimed that Mr. George’s experiences were unique” (Doc. 160 at 18), and that \n“[t]here is no evidence before this Court that by incarcerating Mr. George for 25 and 55 \ndays that defendants were following a practice unique to Mr. George.” (Id. at 13.)  \n274.  In support of his argument that he has factually proved a policy, practice or procedure, \nPlaintiff cites a record in another case dealing with persons found incompetent to stand trial, \nAdvocacy Center for Elderly and Disabled v. Louisiana Dep’t of Health and Hospitals, 731 \nF. Supp. 2d 603, 627 (E.D. La. 2010).  (Doc. 160 at 13).  Plaintiff also points the Court to a \ndecision of this Court denying a motion to dismiss. See generally Cooper, 2014 WL \n7334911. Yet neither of these cases provides the factual support for the argument made \nhere.  \n275.  While the Court certainly has concerns with the extended incarcerations of George without \na hearing, it is Plaintiff’s burden to prove his allegations, including the allegation that there \nwas a “policy, procedure and practice.” It is not the Defendants’ burden to show these two \nincidents were unique.  \n276.  As noted above, the Court finds that two arrests do not establish a “policy, practice or \nprocedure.” While the two share the common fact that George was arrested and incarcerated \nfor violating a condition of his release (being physically assaultive and aggressive and \npresenting a danger to others), the two incidents are also significantly different. The first \ninvolved his conduct while on release in a group home and at his day program while the \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 68 of 78\nsecond occurred at ELMHS. More importantly, however, even if identical, the number of \nincidents is insufficient to establish a policy, procedure or practice. \n277.  Tubbs’ testimony that “over the years, [he] moved to revoke somewhere around 12 to 18 of \nthe Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity folks that [he] supervised,” (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at \n84:17-86:12), likewise does not establish the policy or procedure Plaintiff claims.  First, \nTubbs testified that he moved to revoke these NGRI acquittees and did not, as Plaintiff’s \nclaimed practice would require, simply arrest and incarcerate them on his own. Rather, the \ntestimony suggests that Tubbs invoked the authority of the court. Second, his testimony \ngives no information as to the circumstances surrounding the conduct that gave rise to the \narrest, including whether or not the acquittees had committed a crime. \n278.  However, even if Plaintiff had proved a policy, procedure, or practice of arresting an NGRI \nacquittee for violations of conditions of release when no crime had been committed, the \nCourt finds that this policy alone does not violate the Constitution for the reasons given \nbelow.  \nH.    ARREST AND INCARCERATION FOR VIOLATIONS OF CONDITIONS OF \nRELEASE WHEN NO CRIME WAS COMMITTED \n \n279.  Plaintiff argues that, while the state may detain pretrial criminal defendants who are a \ndanger to others or to the community, the Supreme Court has explicitly approved of this \npractice only in narrow circumstances to prevent “the most serious of crimes” and only \nwhere a court makes an initial determination of probable cause for the detention followed \nby a “prompt” detention hearing to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no other \nless restrictive condition could ensure the safety of the community. (Doc. 151, ¶ 141) (citing \nFoucha, 504 U.S. at 81–82; United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987)).  \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 69 of 78\n280.  Plaintiff argues that, even without a policy, practice or procedure, he has proven that his \narrest and incarceration on two occasions violated his substantive due process rights. \n281.  Indeed, says Plaintiff, even where it is appropriate to revoke probation and return him to \nconfinement, the law requires the detention to be in a public or private mental hospital, not \na jail.  (Doc. 151, ¶ 152) (citing La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 654.) \n282.  Plaintiff claims that Defendants chose to have George arrested and placed in East Baton \nRouge  Parish  Prison  on  two  separate  occasions,  despite  the  fact  that  less  restrictive \nalternatives were available.  Such alternatives included treating George at a private mental \nhospital.  According to Plaintiff, a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would have \nappreciated the risk of placing a severely ill man in a parish prison setting not intended to \nprovide the level of mental health treatment necessary.  (Doc. 151, ¶ 162.) \n283.  In post-trial briefing, Plaintiff characterized his claims as whether it was constitutional to \nconfine him in a parish prison for six weeks.  (Doc. 151, ¶¶ 151, 153 (emphasis added).)  \nHowever, as noted previously, Plaintiff has since acknowledged that his constitutional \nclaims are “limited to the issue of whether the arrest and incarceration of George solely for \nviolation of conditions of his release in the absence of a criminal arrest violated George’s \nsubstantive due process rights.” (Doc. 163 at 1.)  Plaintiff’s constitutional claims do not \ninclude “issues of length of incarceration before release, length of incarceration without or \nbefore a hearing, adequacy of medical care, and other issues.”  (Id.) \n284.  Defendants, on the other hand, argue that “when an arrest is made by state officers acting \npursuant to state authority, ‘the requisite standard of probable cause for a lawful arrest is \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 70 of 78\ndetermined by state law, provided such law meets federal constitutional standards.’” (Doc. \n152, ¶ 96) (citing United States v. Ullrich, 580 F.2d 765, 769 (5th Cir. 1978)).   \n285.  Defendants insist that La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B) specifically authorizes the arrest \nand detention of an NGRI acquittee in conformity with the applicable provisions of La. \nCode Crim. Proc. art. 899, and La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 899(B) provides that a probation \nofficer may arrest a defendant without a warrant if the officer “has reasonable cause to \nbelieve that a defendant violated or is about to violate a condition of his probation” and \ntherefore such an arrest does not violate the Fourth Amendment. (Doc. 152, ¶ 97.) \n286.  The term “reasonable cause” is also cited in La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 213, which sets forth \ngenerally the instances in which a peace officer may lawfully arrest someone without a \nwarrant. “In interpreting the meaning of ‘reasonable cause’ in . . .  Code of Criminal \nProcedure Art. 213, reasonable cause has been equated with probable cause.” (Doc. 152, \n¶ 98) (citing Lawrence v. Henderson, 344 F. Supp. 1287, 1292 n.15 (E.D. La. 1972) aff’d, \n478 F.2d 705 (5th Cir. 1973)).   \n287.  Defendants  maintain  that  reasonable  cause  under  Louisiana  law  has  been  “judicially \nrecognized as equivalent to probable cause.” (Doc. 152, ¶ 99) (citing, inter alia, Haith v. \nCity of Shreveport, 2005 WL 2140583, at *4 (W.D. La. Sept. 1, 2005); Sebald v. City of \nNew Orleans, 2005 WL 1400428, at *4 (E.D. La. June 6, 2005)). \n288.  Because Defendants had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for violating the conditions of his \nconditional release order for exhibiting violent and threatening behavior at the time of both \narrests, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s arrest and incarceration were both consistent \nwith Louisiana and constitutional law. (D Brief, Doc. 152, ¶ 100.)  \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 71 of 78\n289.  First, the Court previously held that the two key provisions of Louisiana’s challenged \nstatutory scheme, La. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 658 and 899, are facially constitutional.  (Doc. \n124 at 3, 22-26.)  As the Court observed, “court after court has refused to declare as \nunconstitutional statutes that authorize the arrest of a person found NGRI upon his or her \nviolations of the conditions of his or her release, assuming any such recommission is \nultimately reviewable by a court of law.”  (Id. at 23-24) (citing Archuleta v. Hedrick, 365 \nF.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 2004); Phelps v. United States, 831 F.2d 897, 898 (9th Cir. 1987); \nCochran v. Dysart, 965 F.2d 649, 649 (8th Cir. 1992); Grass v. Reitz, 643 F.3d 579 (8th \nCir. 2011)); see also Ward, 2017 WL 1611761 at *4 (“A determination that an insanity \nacquittee is dangerous, without more, would therefore be insufficient to make constitutional \nan  insanity  acquittee’s  indefinite  incarceration  in  a  county  jail.  Moreover,  continued \ndetention based on dangerousness and mental illness is only constitutional when there has \nbeen a sufficiently prompt full adversarial hearing . . .” (emphasis added, spelling altered)); \ncf. Lynch v. Baxley, 386 F. Supp. 378, 387 (M.D. Ala. 1974) (three-judge panel) (Alabama \nstatutes providing for emergency detention in county jail or state mental hospitals were \nfacially unconstitutional because they authorized “ex parte and summary deprivation of \nliberty without any of the rudimentary protections long recognized as required by the due \nprocess of law;” emergency detention absent a hearing was constitutional “only for the \nlength of time required to arrange a probable cause hearing,” and in no event for more than \nseven days). \n290.  While Plaintiff’s current constitutional challenge is not styled as such, it is in a very real \nway a continuing facial challenge since it claims principally that any arrest and incarceration \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 72 of 78\nof an NGRI acquittee for violating his conditions of release when the acquittee has not been \naccused of committing a crime is unconstitutional, regardless of the circumstances. (Pl.’s \nSecond Amd. Compl., Doc. 42 at 18-19; Doc. 160 at 1-4; Doc. 163 at 1). Counsel for \nPlaintiff conceded as much at oral argument. \n291.  As previously discussed, however, even though George was not legally responsible for the \nacts he committed, the Supreme Court has emphasized that an NGRI acquittee is not free to \nresume his life unfettered by any restrictions. Society has an interest in insuring that an \ninsanity acquittee poses no danger to himself or the public.  Jones, 463 U.S. at 368.  This \ninterest is typically stronger in the case of an NGRI than other persons subject to non-\npunitive commitment, as an NGRI has been found beyond a reasonable doubt to have \ncommitted a criminal act.  Id. at 364. \n292.  Moreover, the Fifth Circuit has reaffirmed the state’s interest in taking reasonable steps to \nprotect society and the acquittee himself from the acquittee’s “potential dangerousness.” \nPoree, 866 F.3d at 248 (“[T]he governing legal principle derived from Foucha and Jones is \nthat a state may continue to confine an insanity acquittee only so long as the acquittee is \nboth mentally ill and dangerous. . . . [I]n Jones the Court indicated that the dangerousness \nfinding is predictive in nature and that the government is permitted to protect against the \n‘potential dangerousness’ of [NGRI] acquittees.”). \n293.  In light of these authorities, the Court reiterates that Louisiana’s statutory scheme, which \nallows for the arrest and short-term detention of an NGRI acquittee in jail for violation of \nconditions of release, with no or less-than-optimal medical care, is facially constitutional. \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 73 of 78\n294.  Such  a  detention,  as  in  this  case,  can  easily  be  “reasonably  related  to  a  legitimate \ngovernmental objective,” Estate of Henson, 795 F.3d at 467 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 539), \ni.e., protection against the real or potential dangerousness of the individual towards himself \nor others.  Poree, 866 F.3d at 248. \n295.  And while the Court agrees that “continued detention based on dangerousness and mental \nillness is only constitutional when there has been a sufficiently prompt and full adversarial \nhearing where the State has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is \ndemonstrably dangerous to the community,” Ward, 2017 WL 1611761 at *4, Louisiana’s \nstatutory scheme provides for such a hearing. La. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 658(B)(6) and \n899(B), (E). \n296.  For the same reason, George’s as-applied claim that his due process rights were violated by \nhis arrest and detention, solely based on his violation of his conditions of release and in the \nabsence of a criminal charge, is also denied.    \n297.  The Court has found as a matter of fact that, at the time of both arrests, George presented \nboth a real and potential danger to those around him.  \n298.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s placement in jail on both occasions was constitutional, as it bore a \nreasonable relationship to the state’s legitimate interest in protecting others from George’s \ndangerousness.  See Foucha, 504 U.S. at 79; see also Luna, 554 F. Supp. at 72 (“The threat \nof immediate harm to self or others clearly justifies the initial detention.”).15  \n                                                 \n15 The Court emphasizes its concern regarding George’s lengthy stays in EBRPP without a hearing or earlier placement \nin a mental hospital. The Court believes that “continued detention based on dangerousness and mental illness is only \nconstitutional when there has been a sufficiently prompt and full adversarial hearing where the State has proved by \nclear and convincing evidence that the individual is demonstrably dangerous to the community.” Ward, 2017 WL \n1611761 at *4 (emphasis added); see also Luna, 554 F. Supp. at 71-76.  There is the additional issue of whether such \nprolonged incarceration in the absence of adequate psychiatric care is punishment. But, as counsel for Defendants \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 74 of 78\n299.  As the Court also discussed above, at the times when Defendants were considering whether \nto jail George, there were reasons to believe that alternative placement was unavailable. \nWhile  the  Court  questions  whether  Brady  and  Tubbs  could  have  done  more,  mere \nnegligence does not give rise to a constitutional violation.  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848-49 (“[T]he \nConstitution  does  not  guarantee  due  care  on  the  part  of  state  officials;  liability  for \nnegligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due \nprocess.”); Neiberger, 239 F. Supp. 2d at 1149 (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848-49)).  \n300.  Furthermore, under the Youngberg standard, the professional judgment of Tubbs, Brady and \nVosburg,16 based upon reasonable evaluation of the threat George posed and the alternatives \navailable, is presumptively valid.  Plaintiff has not overcome this presumption, nor does it \nappear that he could do so in light of the facts previously found by the Court based upon the \nevidence and testimony at trial.  As Youngberg observes, “the Constitution only requires \nthat the courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not \nappropriate for the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable choices \nshould have been made.”  457 U.S. at 321-22.   \n301.  Although Plaintiff encourages the Court to graft a “least restrictive setting” component onto \nthe Youngberg standard, the Fifth Circuit has rejected this approach in a similar factual \nsetting, Lelsz, 807 F.2d at 1249 & n.8 (rejecting reading of Youngberg that “attempt[ed] to \ntransform the state right of a least restrictive environment into a federal right”), and the \nCourt therefore declines to adopt it. \n                                                 \nunderstandably pointed out at oral argument, because the length of George’s incarcerations and quality of medical care \nwere not (and are not) issues before the Court, Defendants did not fully address these issues at trial or in briefing. \n16 The Court finds that all three were “professionals” as defined by Youngberg: someone “competent, whether by \neducation, training or experience, to make the particular decision at issue.” 457 U.S. at 323, n. 30. \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 75 of 78\n302.  In the alternative, for substantially the same reasons, the Court cannot conclude that \nDefendants’ decision to jail George was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances \nor that the Defendants were actually aware of and disregarded a substantial risk of serious \nharm.  Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2470; Alderson, 848 F.3d at 419-20.  This is especially true \nsince George received some level of care, albeit far from ideal, at EBRPP. Instead, \nDefendants exercised reasonable judgment under the circumstances, evaluating both the \nthreat  that  George  posed  and  the  alternatives  available,  and  came  to  the  objectively \nreasonable conclusion that short-term placement of George in the EBRPP was warranted. \n303.  For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated legal \njustification for the issuance of the requested declaratory judgment and injunction as it \npertains to his constitutional claims.  \nI.    PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS SEEKING DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF UNDER THE ADA AND SECTION 504 \n \n304.  In its verdict, the jury found that Defendants DHH and LDPSC had “not discriminate[d] \nagainst Plaintiff because of his disabilities” either under the ADA or Section 504. (Doc. 144 \nat 1-2.) They further found that these same Defendants had not “fail[ed] to provide Plaintiff \nwith a reasonable modification appropriate for his disabilities.” (Id.) \n305.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, practices, and \nprocedures of arresting and incarcerating individuals in correctional facilities who have \nbeen placed on conditional discharge following a finding of NGRI based on a violation of \na condition of their discharge violates Plaintiff’s rights under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”). (See \nDoc. 42.) \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 76 of 78\n306. Following initial post-trial briefing, the Court asked the parties to answer certain specific \nquestions, including the following: “With respect to Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and \nRA, what effect or weight must/should the Court give to the jury’s findings?” (Doc. 159 at \n5.) \n307. In response, Plaintiff “admits that, as long as the jury’s findings stand, this Court is obliged \nto apply [the] law to the facts as the jury found them.” (Doc. 160 at 160.)  Defendants agree. \n(Doc. 161 at 11.) \n308.  However, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), Plaintiff renews its motion for \njudgment as a matter of law (“JMOL”) made at the close of the evidence. (Doc. 160 at 23-\n24; Trial Tr., Doc. 150 at 62:21-63:20.) The motion was denied by the Court because of \nquestions of fact on critical questions ultimately answered by the jury in its verdict. (Id. at \n63:18-20.)  Defendants oppose the motion, arguing principally that there was sufficient \nevidence to support the jury’s verdict.  (Doc. 168 at 4-9.) \n309.  Plaintiff correctly sets forth the standard the Court must follow in considering Plaintiff’s \nrenewed motion. (Doc. 160 at 23-24). A motion for JMOL raises only a question of law: \n“[w]hether there is any evidence which, if believed, would authorize a verdict against \nmovant.” Marsh v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 175 F.2d 498, 500 (5th Cir. 1949). “A judgment as \na  matter  of  law  is  appropriate  if  the  facts  and  inferences  point  so  strongly  and \noverwhelmingly in favor of one party that reasonable people could not arrive at a verdict to \nthe contrary.” Buchanan v. City of San Antonio, 85 F.3d 196, 198 (5th Cir. 1996). In \nconsidering a motion for JMOL, the court is not to re-weigh the evidence or assess the \ncredibility of witnesses. See Lytle v. Household Mgf., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 554 (1990).  \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 77 of 78\nRather, the court must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the non-\nmovant and draw all inferences in the non-movant’s favor. Becker v. PaineWebber, Inc., \n962 F.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir. 1992). \n310.  At trial, there was an abundance of evidence showing that first, George was arrested because \nhe posed a potential danger to others. (See, e.g., Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 124:24–125:23; \nKelly Test., Doc. 149 at 79:21–24, 80:1-6; Pl.’s Trial Ex. 11 at TG000014; Defs.’s Trial Ex. \n5 at 1–2.)  Second, the uncontradicted testimony at trial was that George was placed at \nEBRPP because there were no beds available at ELMHS.  (See, e.g., Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 \nat 84:6–10; see also Brady Test., Doc. 148 at 122:4–18, 124:22-23, 126:3–13, 127:21–22). \nFinally, there was evidence presented to the jury that, while not identical to the care he \nwould have received at ELMHS, nonetheless, he received the care of a psychiatrist and a \nsocial worker and received at least some of his psychiatric medicines while at EBRPP. (See, \ne.g., Burns Test., Doc. 149 at 106:13–110:17, 145:4-9). \n311.  Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Defendants, a reasonable jury \ncould conclude, as this one did, that George was not arrested and incarcerated (the alleged \nbasis for Plaintiff’s charge of discrimination) based on his disability, but rather, based on \nthe potential danger he posed to others and himself. Further, a reasonable jury could \nconclude that the care he received at EBRPP, while not optimal, was not discriminatory and \nwas a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances. \n312.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is denied. \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 169    09/29/17   Page 78 of 78\n313.  Given the jury’s findings, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated legal \njustification for the issuance of the requested declaratory judgment and injunction as it \npertains to his ADA and Section 504 claims. \nCONCLUSION \nIn  light  of  the  foregoing  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law,  IT  IS  HEREBY \nORDERED THAT Plaintiff’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is DENIED and \nPlaintiff’s claims are DENIED in all respects.  Judgment shall be entered in favor of Defendants \nand against Plaintiff by separate document in conformity with Rule 58. \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 29, 2017. \n \n \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \n78 \n ",

As will be discussed in the following sections, \nDefendants were acting in a manner permitted by the statutes’ substantive provisions when they \narrested, or had Mr. George arrested, in 2013 and 2014. However, Defendants failed completely \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 2 of 29\nto comply with the statutes’ procedural requirements. It is Mr. George’s position that since \nArticles 658(B)(1) and 899(B) authorized his arrest and incarceration even though at the time he \nwas not being charged with, and had not been convicted of any crime relevant to his arrest, they \nare unconstitutional, and that even if Defendants had complied with the statutes’ procedural \ncomponents, the constitutional defect would not have been cured. \n  DEFENDANTS COMPLIED WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS \nOF LOUISIANA CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARTICLES \n658(B)(1) AND 899(B). \n \nGiven the broad sweep of the statutes, Mr. George contends that his arrest was authorized \nby Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Articles 658(B)(1) and 899(B), which, on their face, \npermit the arrest and incarceration in a parish jail of a person found Not Guilty by Reason of \nInsanity (NGRI) who is living in the community on conditional discharge. Under Louisiana’s \nNGRI statute, an individual charged with a criminal offense is exempt from criminal \nresponsibility for his behavior when “the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease \nor mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with \nreference to the conduct in question.” La. R.S. 14:14. The exemption from criminal \nresponsibility contemplated by La. R.S. 14:14 is contradicted by the plain language of Articles \n658(B)(1) and 899(B), which permit a person acquitted by NGRI (“NGRI Acquittee”) to be \narrested and incarcerated merely on a probation officer’s “reasonable cause to believe that a \ndefendant has violated or is about to violate a condition of his probation….”  Articles 658(B)(1) \nand 899(B) afford the probation officer broad, unchecked authority to arrest an NGRI Acquittee: \nthey do not require the NGRI Aquittee to have committed, nor be charged with, a crime; do not \nrequire a determination of whether the NGRI Acquittee is a danger to himself or others; do not \nrequire the arresting officer to weigh the nature and significance of the condition of release in \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 3 of 29\ndetermining whether arrest is warranted; and do not factor in whether the violation is directly the \nresult of the NGRI Acquittee’s mental illness.1 La. Code Crim. P. art. 899(B).  \nUnder our Constitution, “[d]ue process requires that the nature and duration of \ncommitment bear some reasonable relationship to the purpose for which the individual is \ncommitted.” Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972). In this context, the breadth of the \nstatutes which authorized Mr. George’s arrest and incarceration are constitutionally problematic \nfor two reasons, even though the statutes also require notice to the court and an opportunity for a \nhearing. First, Mr. George’s conditional release, upon which his arrests and incarcerations were \npredicated, was not the result of a criminal conviction and his arrests and incarcerations were not \nthe result of having been charged with criminal behavior; rather it was the result of a \ndetermination by a state court judge that Mr. George needed monitoring and treatment for his \nmental illness and developmental disabilities.2 Second, unlike probation or parole following a \ncriminal conviction (and often some jail time), Mr. George’s conditional release was not an \nextension of the penalties imposed for having been convicted of a crime; rather Mr. George had \nbeen found “Not Guilty,” albeit “by reason of Insanity.”3  \n                                                      \n1   Other than a “cause to believe” that Mr. George “has violated or is about to violate a condition of his \nprobation,” the statute sets no limits on the authority of a probation officer to arrest and incarcerate an NGRI \nAcquittee on conditional release. Thus, the breadth of these statutes clearly pose a substantial risk that Mr. George \ncould be arrested and incarcerated in a parish jail for a host of minor infractions, including the failure to follow the \ntreatment recommendations prescribed by his treating physician, the failure to “comply and cooperate with sessions \nof counseling and/or treatment, oral and/or injectable medications as ordered by the attending physician”; the failure \nto report to the local probation office within twenty-four (24) hours of release from jail, excluding non-business \ndays; the failure to sign all consents for release of information forms; and the failure to “refrain from the \nconsumption of alcohol.” Trial Stipulation ¶ 3, Pl.’s Ex. 1, TG000001–02.  \n \n2   In ordering a conditional release, the court “shall subject a conditionally released insanity acquittee to such \norders and conditions it deems will best meet the acquittee's need for treatment, supervision, and monitoring and \nwill best serve the interests of justice and society.” La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1(B). \n \n3   It is not Mr. George’s position that La. Code Crim. P. Art. 899 is unconstitutional as to convicted criminals \non probation. In that situation, the individual has been found guilty of a crime, and probation is simply an extension-\n- a less restrictive extension-- of his sentence. It is, however, Mr. George’s position that to the extent that they \nauthorize the release and incarceration for violations of conditional release, the combined provisions of La. Code \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 4 of 29\nIn authorizing the arrest and incarceration of individuals on conditional release for merely \nviolating terms of their release, Articles 658(B)(1) and 899 create a substantial risk that Mr. \nGeorge and other individuals with mental illness and developmental disabilities will be \nincarcerated for behavior which should be addressed in a treatment setting that is designed \nespecially to cater to the needs of individuals like Mr. George.4  For example, Progressive Health \nCare Providers (PHP) the group homes where Mr. George resided in 2013 Intermediate Care \nFacilities for People with Developmental Disabilities (“ICF-DDs”),  overseen by Louisiana’s \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals’ Developmental Disabilities Services System to provide an \narray of services to individuals who have developmental disabilities and mental illness. Martinez \nTest., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. 30-36.  Such services include mental health services, a day activities \nprogram, and a Behavioral Support Plan to address behaviors that are a manifestation of \nindividuals’ disabilities. Martinez Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. 30-36 June 26, 2016; Hope Test., \nTrial Tr. vol. 2, p. 181-82 June 27, 2016.  \nSignificantly, these programs are specifically designed to address the very issues that led \nto Mr. George’s arrest. According to his Behavioral Support Plan, Mr. George’s mental illness \ncaused him on some occasions to engage in verbal aggression and non-compliance within the \ngroup home and the day program he attended during the week. Martinez Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. \n33; Hope Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, p. 181-182. His Behavioral Support Plan notes that when his \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nCrim. P. arts. 658 (B) and Art. 899 are unconstitutional as to NGRI Acquittees on conditional release. In such cases, \nthere is no punishment nor sentence. To the extent such individuals are subject to confinement, it must be solely for \nthe purpose of treatment. \n \n4   Mr. Tubbs testified that he has moved to arrest and incarcerate 12-18 persons for violating terms of their \nconditional releases. Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 84, 6/27/16. This is true despite the fact that there are options \nunder Louisiana law other than arrest and incarceration where an acquittee violates the terms of conditional release. \nIf a person on conditional release or otherwise probated under the aforementioned code provisions is in need of \nacute, i.e. short-term, hospitalization and is not charged with a new criminal offense, he may be voluntarily admitted \npursuant to La. R.S. 28:52 or admitted by emergency certificate pursuant to La. R.S. 28:53 to the Feliciana Forensic \nFacility or to another suitable treatment facility, with subsequent notice to the court. La. Code Crim. P. art. \n658(B)(4). \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 5 of 29\nmedication is incorrect, he may engage in outbursts and so-called “threatening” episodes. \nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 17, TG000151–153. At no point does his Behavioral Support Plan call for him \nto be punished in any way for the behaviors caused by his disabilities. Id.   \nThe evidence at trial overwhelming shows that the kinds of behaviors exhibited by Mr. \nGeorge are not in the least unusual in the ICF-DD group home environment, where six to eight \nmen with mental illness and developmental disabilities are living and interacting in very close \nquarters with one another in order to receive services appropriate to their disabilities. Hope Test., \nTrial Tr. vol. 2, p. 182. According to Ms. Martinez: \nQ    So let me draw your attention to -- well, going, again, to July 2013 and \nbefore, did you ever observe Trussell being aggressive with staff; and if so, could \nyou describe what that means? \n \nA   I wouldn't use the word \"aggressive.\" Physically aggressive, no. I have \nobserved Trussell fussing, yelling at staff, yelling happens at my house regularly, \nso I – it wasn't to the point of -- six to eight people living in the same home \ntogether, if you want to do something and the staff's not paying attention: oh, \nyou're not listening to me. It's – I never saw him in an aggressive manner, though, \nno. Argumentative, absolutely. He's a grown man, though, living with other \ngrown men, who might all be arguing. That is absolutely nothing unusual in a \ngroup home. \n \nQ   What about -- what about threatening, did you ever see him be threatening \nto anybody? \n \nA   Yes. I can – I can think of one time and I believe that all four of the \nresidents were threatening each other to take this, do that. Again, it was not -- it's \nnothing unusual in a group home for those type of things to happen. And then ten \nminutes later, they're all drinking a coke together. \n \nUnfortunately, Articles 658(B)(1) and 899 give license to state officials to use the \ncriminal justice system as a substitute for the provision of mental health care in difficult cases.  \nUnder the plain language of these statutes, state officials have the power to arrest an NGRI \nAcquittee, like Mr. George, even when he has not committed or been charged with a criminal \nact. Prior to the 2013 arrest, the Defendants were well aware of Mr. George’s mental health \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 6 of 29\nneeds and recognized that the more appropriate setting for a person exhibiting his symptoms \nwould have been a hospital.  However, other than briefly and unsuccessfully attempting to place \nMr. George at ELMHS, they did nothing to ensure that he was placed in a facility where he could \nreceive the mental health treatment he needs. Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, pgs. 84, 86-87.  \nIt is clear, however, that there were other options besides parish jail available to the \nDefendants. Instead of incarcerating Mr. George, Defendants could have voluntarily admitted \nhim to Feliciana Forensic Facility pursuant to La. R.S. § 28:52 or admitted him by emergency \ncertificate pursuant to La. R.S. § 28:53., If Feliciana was unavailable, Defendants had the option \nto admit Mr. George to another suitable treatment facility, with subsequent notice to the court. \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(4). In the alternative, they could have sought a court order \npursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(C) to intensify Mr. George’s supervision, to modify or \nadd additional conditions to the probation, including enhanced mental treatment. As a last resort, \nDefendants could have moved to revoke Mr. George’s probation and recommit him to a state \nmental institution.  Any of these alternatives, all of which were available to Defendants, would \nhave been less restrictive than incarcerating Mr. George.   \nSimilarly, in 2014, even though Mr. George was already at ELMHS, and there was \nclearly available space, including the placement he was already occupying, Defendants opted to \nhave him arrested.  The testimony establishes that this decision was made largely because \nDefendants viewed it as an appropriate punishment for refusing the placement option they had \nproposed. See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 13 (“This staffing was to inform Mr. George that he would \neither have to accept placement in the Civil Division or we would pursue revocation, and he \nwould probably have to go to jail first. [He] became very angry and ultimately we had to call his \nprobation officer, and he was taken back to the jail.”). The primary reason for incarcerating Mr. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 7 of 29\nGeorge was not therapeutic but punitive.  It is also a reflection of the limited placement options \navailable at ELMHS. As Dr. Kelly admitted: \nQ   You have. And in the conditions of release anywhere, is there a reference \nto if Mr. George doesn't comply he gets sent to jail? \n \nA   I don't think it's quite stated in those terms, but, I mean, it's -- it's -- if they \ndon't comply, they may be revoked and sent back to the forensic hospital. \n \nQ   Oh, so he could be sent back to a hospital? \n \nA   Yes. \n \nQ   And that's referenced in the conditional release; isn't that right? \n \nA   Yes. \n \nQ   But jail's not mentioned, is it? \n \nA   Well, if you're not guilty by reason of insanity and you're in a group home \nand you're out in the community and you-- you know, the forensic coordinator is \ncalled because the patient is acting out, they often end up in jail because there's no \nbed in the forensic division. I mean, that's why we're here today. \n \nKelly Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, pgs. 103-04. \n \n  DEFENDANTS VIOLATED THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF \nLOUISIANA CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARTICLES 658(B)(1) \nAND 899(B). \nAs this Court noted in its August 23, 2017, order, in the event that a probation officer \nintends to arrest or cause the arrest of a NGRI Acquittee, Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure \nArticle 658(B)(5) requires the division of probation and parole, or the Louisiana Department of \nHealth through the conditional release program coordinator, “to immediately notify the court of \nany substantive violations or imminent violations of the conditions of a person’s probated release \nand present recommendations to the court regarding whether the court should revoke the \nprobation and recommit the probationer to a state mental institution or other recommendations as \nmay be appropriate.” Article 658(B)(6) further requires the court, upon receiving a report \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 8 of 29\nrecommending revocation or other disposition from the conditional release program coordinator, \nto “immediately hold a hearing to consider the violations listed or transfer the case to the parish \nof commitment, if different from that of the arrest, at which place the hearing should be held as \nsoon as possible.” \nArticle 899(B) dictates that, following an arrest of an NGRI Acquittee for an alleged \nviolation of a condition of release, the probation officer “shall immediately notify the proper \ncourt of the arrest and shall submit a written report showing in what manner the defendant \nviolated, or was about to violate a condition of his probation.”  \nIt is Mr. George’s position that these procedural requirements were not complied with in \nconnection with either the July 2013 or July 2014 incidents at issue in this case. It also Mr. \nGeorge’s position that even if these procedures were followed his rights under the constitution \nwere violated, since Articles 658(B)(1) and 899(B) permit his arrest and incarceration even when \nno criminal charges are involved. \n1.  The July 2013 arrest. \nEven assuming there was reasonable cause to believe in 2013 that  Mr. George had \nviolated or was about to violate a condition of his “probation” or that an emergency existed, \nDefendant Tubbs did not comply with the procedural requirements of La. Code Crim. P. art. \n658(B). Under that statute, a probation officer is required to “immediately notify the proper \ncourt” of an arrest and submit a “written report showing in what manner the defendant violated, \nor was about to violate, a condition of his probation.”  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B). Defendant \nTubbs did not submit the “written report” to request a court hearing until August 12, 2013, two \nweeks after Mr. George’s July 2013 arrest. Plaintiff’s Exh. 11; Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. \n22.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 9 of 29\nOn August 22, 2013, twenty-five (25) days after his arrest, Mr. George finally had a \nhearing in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge, after which he was ordered to \nbe released from jail and provided with mental health treatment. Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, p. \n22. \n2.  The July 2014 arrest. \nMr. George’s 2014 arrest was also procedurally deficient. While the East Baton Rouge \nSheriff’s Office was given a written notice that Mr. George was to be incarcerated in the East \nBaton Rouge Parish Prison in July 2014, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 20, there is no evidence that any \nnotice was provided to the presiding state court. In 2014, Mr. George remained in jail for 55 \ndays, until August 25, 2014. Trial Stipulations, Plaintiff’s Exh. 24 at ¶¶ 19-20. \nQUESTION 2: WHAT WERE THE REASONS FOR AND CIRCUMSTANCES \nSURROUNDING PLAINTIFF’S RELEASE FROM THE EAST BATON ROUGE \nPARISH PRISON ON AUGUST 23, 2013? \n \n  This Court asked to be pointed to evidence produced at trial that explains why and how \nMr. George was released from jail in 2013.  Except for the testimony of Stephanie Hope, the trial \nrecord does not fully reflect the circumstances surrounding Mr. George’s release.5  The record \nshows that, on August 22, 2013, there was “a probation revocation hearing in front of the Judge” \nand the judge ordered Mr. George’s release from jail. Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 21. As Ms. \nHope testified: \nQ   What happened at the court hearing? \n                                                      \n5   The documents filed with this court in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment show that this \nhearing was held and the order was issued after Mr. George filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging his \nincarceration. The Writ was filed on August 20, 2013. Pl.’s Ex. 3 at 162:13–25, 163:1–22, 178:17–25, 179:1–25, \n180:1–13; Pl.’s Ex. 10.  \n \nThe Summary Judgment documents also show that in on July 14, 2014, Mr. George, through counsel, filed a motion \nrequesting the state district court to schedule a hearing on Mr. George’s arrest. Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Exh. \n12. When the court did not respond to that request, Mr. George again filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. Id. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 10 of 29\n \nA   I talked to the judge. I'm not sure what they call it, but we were able to come up to \nwhere the judge sits to have a conversation off the -- I guess off-the-record, I don't know \nthat any notes were taken, and I just told him I was Director of Operations of the group \nhome where Trussell lived. I believed that Trussell had been incarcerated because my \nstaff were incompetent, they had called the probation officer when there really wasn't a \nneed to call the probation officer. Those were Trussell's normal behaviors, and he was \nincarcerated and that Trussell was mentally ill and he needed treatment and, in my \nopinion, jail wasn't where he needed to be. \n \nQ   And was he released that day? \n \nA   The judge released him that day. \n \nHope Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, p. 192-93. \nQUESTION 3: A) WERE THERE REQUESTS FOR STATE COURT HEARINGS, AND \nB) WERE STATE COURT HEARINGS HELD IN CONNECTION WITH MR. \nGEORGE’S CASE, AND IF SO, WHAT WERE THE DATES OF EACH, THE \nCIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING OR LEADING UP TO THE HEARINGS, THE \nSUBSTANCE OF THE HEARINGS, AND THE OUTCOME OF THOSE HEARINGS? \n \nDuring the course of the proceedings in this case, there were a number of hearings held \nconcerning Mr. George’s conditional release. The evidence shows that, on June 10, 2013, one \nand a half months prior to Mr. George’s arrest, Defendant Tubbs sent a letter to the state district \ncourt advising “that in the last 4 weeks [Mr. George] has been verbally aggressive with staff over \nfood” and requesting a review hearing to address Mr. George’s conditional release expiration \ndate and alleged violations of the group home’s rules. Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9; Defendants’ Exhibit \n4. The letter did not provide any recommendations to the court, as required by Louisiana Code of \nCriminal Procedure Article 658(B)(5), regarding whether the court should revoke Mr. George’s \ndischarge. Nevertheless, Defendant Tubbs testified that, at the time, he planned to move Mr. \nGeorge “to a new group home to solve the problem.” Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. 75-76, line \n1. There is no evidence that Mr. George was served with a copy of this letter. In any case, \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 11 of 29\nDefendant Tubbs testified that he does not believe that the state district court held a hearing in \nresponse to his June 10, 2013 letter. Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. 76, line 1. \n  On August 12, 2013, two weeks after Mr. George’s July 2013 arrest, Defendant Tubbs \nfor the first time notified the court in writing that Mr. George had been arrested, requested a \nhearing, and recommended that the court revoke Mr. George’s probation. Plaintiff’s Ex. 11; \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, p. 78, line 1.6  On August 22, 2013, a hearing was held and the \njudge ordered Mr. George’s release from jail. Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 21. \nThe stipulations between the parties state that “[a]fter Plaintiff Trussell George’s arrest, \nhe was incarcerated from July 29, 2013 to August 23, 2013, at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison.”  \nOn December 5, 2013, prior to the expiration of Mr. George’s five-year conditional \nrelease period, Defendant Brady filed a status review with the court requesting a hearing and \nrecommending that Mr. George’s conditional discharge be extended for another year. Plaintiff’s \nEx. 12.  On May 14, 2014, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish \nextended Mr. George’s conditional release to December 14, 2014. Trial Stipulation ¶ 18. \nMr. George was incarcerated again on July 1, 2014 for allegedly violating a condition of \nhis release. Plaintiff’s Ex. 13. While the East Baton Rouge’s Sheriff’s Office was given a written \nnotice that Mr. George was to be incarcerated in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison in July \n2014, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 20, there is no evidence that any notice was provided to presiding state \ncourt until August 22, 2014, when Defendant Brady filed an “Episode Report” advising the state \n                                                      \n6   As noted above, the record on Summary Judgment also shows that a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed by \ncounsel for Mr. George on August 22, 2013. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 12 of 29\ncourt of Mr. George’s arrest and requesting a revocation hearing. Plaintiff’s Ex. 14. Mr. George \nremained in jail until August 25, 2014.7 Trial Stipulations at ¶19-20. \nQUESTION 4: EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANTS’ POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND \nPROCEDURES. \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures cause NGRI Acquittees to be \narrested for non-criminal violations or perceived violations of the terms of \ntheir conditional release. \nDefendants have never disputed that it is a practice and policy of the Department of \nPublic  Safety  and  Corrections  to  arrest  and  incarcerate  NGRI  Acquittees  on  conditional \ndischarge who have violated a term of their conditional release.  Indeed, Defendant Tubbs, who \none of the Probation and Parole Officers employed by the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections, testified that he alone has “moved to revoke the conditional release of somewhere \naround 12 to  18 of the Not Guilty by Reason of  Insanity folk…” who were  arrested and \nincarcerated in the East Baton or Orleans Parish prisons. Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 84-85 \n6/27/16.  He further testified that he was following Department policy when he arrested Mr. \nGeorge: \nQ   And you responded, \"well, we should probably arrest him [Mr. George]”; is that \nright? \n \nA   Probably correct, yes. \n \nQ   And you consulted your supervisor regarding this decision? \n \nA   I did. \n \nQ   And it was your understanding that the department's policy is that Mr. George’s \narrest was in accordance with departmental policy? \n \nA   Yes. \n                                                      \n7   As noted above, the Summary Judgment record shows that, on July 14, 2014, Mr. George, through counsel, \nfiled a motion requesting the state district court to schedule a hearing on Mr. George’s arrest and a Petition for Writ \nof Habeas Corpus on August 5, 2015. Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Ex. 12. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 13 of 29\n \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 84, 6/27/16. Moreover, as the testimony indicates, Defendants \nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections and the Louisiana Department of Health act in \nconcert in making decisions regarding, and executing, the arrest and incarceration of individuals \non conditional discharge. Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 83–84, 6/27/16; Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. \n2, 93–94, 6/28/16.   \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures cause NGRI Acquittees to be \nincarcerated for more than one day. \nThere is no evidence before this Court that by incarcerating Mr. George for 25 and 55 \ndays that Defendants were following a practice unique to Mr. George. Indeed, Louisiana has a \nlong history of confining mentally ill individuals in parish jails for extended periods of time, \neven when a court orders that they be transferred to a mental health facility. For example, in \nAdvocacy Center for Elderly & Disabled v. Louisiana Dep’t of Health & Hospitals, 731 F. Supp. \n2d 603, 627 (E.D. La. 2010), the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their \nclaim that the lengthy incarceration of persons found individuals found incompetent to stand trial \nviolated  due  process;  the  court  ordered  the  state  to  take  physical  custody  of  them  these \nindividuals and provide appropriate mental health care within twenty-one (21) days.8  \nFinally, the fact that individuals needing mental health treatment were languishing in and \nhabitually  warehoused  in  parish  jails  per  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and  procedure  is \nsupported by the testimony of Eric Defendant Brady: \nQ   So the decision to arrest Mr. George in July 2013 was made collectively \nby you, Dr. Vosburg and Mr. Tubbs; is that correct? \n                                                      \n8   More recently, in Cooper v. Kliebert, Civil Action No. 14–507–SDD–SCR, 2014 WL 7334911 (M.D. LA \nDec. 19, 2014), this Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims that their incarceration in \nLouisiana correctional facilities for months while awaiting bed space at ELMHS violated their rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act (“RA”). The parties in the Cooper eventually entered into a Settlement Agreement. Cooper v. \nKliebert, Civil Action No. 14–507–SDD–SCR (Doc. Rec. 197-1). \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 14 of 29\n \nA   Yes, Ma’am. \n \nQ   Is it your understanding that a person can be involuntarily committed to a \npsychiatric facility if they're a danger to themselves or to other people? \n \nA   Yes, Ma’am. \n \nQ   And it's also your testimony that there was not a bed available in any -- in \na psychiatric facility the weekend Mr. George was arrested? \n \nA   We give special considerations for people under the legal status of not \nguilty by reason of insanity and at the time, we didn't have any beds available. \n \nQ   At ELMHS? \n \nA   Yes, Ma’am. \n \nBrady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 127, 6/27/16.  \nMoreover, it is clear from Mr. Brady’s testimony regarding the 2013 arrest and Dr. \nKelly’s testimony regarding the 2014 arrest that the lack of available mental health beds was \nmuch more than a fleeting occurrence restricted to a particular weekend. \nQ   Mr. Brady, I hate to interrupt you, but I just want to make sure that I get \nthe answer to this question. So did you, from the time Mr. George was arrested, \nJuly 29th of 2013, to the time he was released in August 21st of 2013, determine \nif there was a bed available for him at the hospital in ELMHS? \n \nA   Yes, we did check on that and there were no beds available. \n \nQ   During that entire period? \n \nA   To my understanding, there was no beds available, otherwise, we would \nhave had him in the hospital. \n \nQ   Thank you.9 \n                                                      \n9   The testimony of Defendant Tubbs also supports Mr. George’s position that because of the lack of bed \nspace at ELMHS, NGRI individuals needing mental health treatment were likely to end up, and languish, in parish \njails. As he stated in response to questioning from this court: \n \nQ   …[T]then with respect to your decision and that of Mr. Brady that his aggressive \nbehavior warranted arrest – let me ask you this, there were no beds, is that why he did not go to \nELMHS? \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 15 of 29\n \nBrady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 128, 6/27/16. See also Kelly Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, pgs. 103-104. \nMr. George’s arrest and incarceration in 2013 and 2014 had far less to do with his \nbehavior than it did with DHH’s LDH’s shortage of beds at ELMHS, and Defendants’ failure \nand refusal to ensure that he was provided appropriate mental health services at ELMHS or some \nother appropriate mental facility as required by state law. \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures cause NGRI Acquittees to \nreceive no or substandard mental health care in jail. \nFirst, NGRI Acquittees in jail nearly by definition receive worse mental health care than \nthose  in  treatment  facilities  like  ELMHS.    According  to  Dr.  McConville,  ELMHS  has \napproximately 20 psychiatrists, five of which are employed full time. ELMHS also employs \npsychologists, a full-time nursing staff, dieticians, occupational therapists, recreational therapists \nand social workers. Furthermore, as in every Joint Commission accredited hospital, each resident \nat ELMHS has an individualized treatment plan and receives active therapy in order to ensure \nthat  its  residents  are  progressing  towards  the  goals  of  hospitalization.  When  appropriate, \nresidents  have  a  drug  treatment  program  available  to  them.  Some  residents  also  receive \nindividual psychotherapy. McConville Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 154-56, 6/28/16. \nELMHS has a number of units that, depending on treatment needs, residents can move \nbetween and into: the ASSA, a forensic unit; the Crossroad Recovery Unit (CRU); the \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nA   That's correct. \n \nQ   So by your way of thinking, there were two choices: first ELMHSs, if there was a bed \navailable, but if not, your only other choice, the way you saw it, was the parish prison? \n \nA   Correct. Until we could go in front of the judge and the judge could make a decision on \nwhat to do with him. \n \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 211, 6/27/16. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 16 of 29\nIntermediate Treatment Unit (ITU); Cedarview, which is another intermediate unit; the East \nAcute Unit; and the Oakcrest unit, which is an admission unit. McConville Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, \n156-57, 6/28/16; Kelly Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 71-73, 6/28/16. \nSecond, even aside from the comparison to ELMHS, it is clear that mental health \ntreatment at EBRPP, as applied to NGRI Acquittees arrested for nothing more than violating a \nterm of their release, is constitutionally substandard.  During trial, in order to highlight the \nindignities to which he was subjected, Mr. George presented ample evidence regarding mental \nhealth treatment at East Baton Rouge Parish Jail (EBRPP),10 where a significant number of \nNGRI Acquittees who are arrested for violating conditions of their release are incarcerated. \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 85-86 6/27/16.  \nThe evidence shows that such individuals are unlikely to receive necessary mental health \ntreatment and that Defendants are well aware of this fact. NGRI Acquittees, such as Mr. George, \nwho are incarcerated are likely be put in an isolation cell and, at most, provided with some \nmedication. The evidence also shows that Defendants, as a matter of course do not contact \nmental health staff at the jail to ensure that NGRI Acquittees are provided with appropriate \nmental health treatment. As Defendant Tubbs testified, \nQ   At the time Mr. George was arrested, it was your understanding that at East Baton \nRouge Parish Prison, the treatment offered to individuals like Mr. George who are not \nguilty by reason of insanity, would include providing medication and the use of isolation \ncells if they were unstable; is that right? \n \nA   Yes. \n \n                                                      \n10   As indicated above, it is Mr. George’s position that regardless of the conditions in EBRPP where he was \nincarcerated, the fact that he was incarcerated in jail at all for violating his conditional release, in and of itself, \nviolated Plaintiff’s due process rights. However, the lack of mental health treatment in the EBRPP makes it clear \nthat the purpose of Plaintiff’s conditional release the provision of mental health treatment--did not bear any \nreasonable relationship to his incarcerations in EBRPP. \n. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 17 of 29\nQ   And when someone is in an isolation cell, it was your understanding that they \nwere locked in there all day except for an hour for recreation and eating meals; is that \nright? \n \nA   That's my understanding. \n \nQ   You also understood that when eating meals a person in isolation would be \nbrought to a cafeteria fully shackled and in, quote, \"a black box;\" is that right? \n \nA   I don't know how they're brought to eat. \n \nQ   And once you had arrested Mr. George, you didn't visit him in jail, did you? \n \nA   No. \n \nQ   And you didn't speak with him and confirm that he was receiving his mental \nhealth medications? \n \nA   I called Lisa Burns and told her about him being arrested and being placed at East \nBaton Rouge Parish Prison, and then she follows up with providing him mental health \ntreatment, medication management, that kind of stuff. \n \nQ   And did you confirm with her that he was receiving his medications? \n \nA   No, I didn't confirm with her after the initial contact. \n \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 82-83 6/27/16; Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 14, 6/28/16. \nIn all, the testimony at trial demonstrates that jail environments are particularly stressful \nfor people with mental illness and antithetical to the treatment purposes underlying the condition \nrelease program.11 As Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Delaney Smith testified, people who suffer from \n                                                      \n11   The evidence in the record is also clear regarding the dire consequences that can result and has resulted \nfrom inadequate treatment. As Ms. Martinez testified regarding Mr. George’s experience, \n \nA   I -- I met him at the jail the day that he was released. He was released -- he was told to be released \nearlier that day in court. I went to the jail, so did two other staff members from PHP, and we waited outside \n-- we were actually going to go in and get him because they didn't know really where he was. Evidently he \nhad checked out but hadn't made it to the gate yet. So just as they were going to let us back in through the \ngate, here -- he's walking out. And Trussell gave me a hug, and the staff from PHP, they took him to the \nhospital for observation. \n \nQ   How did Trussell look at that time? \n \nA   Worse than he did before I saw him. He absolutely smelled like he had not bathed. He was very \nscruffy, dirty. His skin was very flakey and ashy looking. He was still – he wasn't dragging his feet as much \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 18 of 29\nmental illness are “very susceptible to the impact of the social isolation of being in a jail. For \nPlaintiff, he was on a 23-plus hour lockdown, which is very difficult for anyone to deal with. \nBut, again someone who’s already paranoid, is suffering voices in their head, has difficulty \ndistinguishing reality, to put them alone in a room just further exacerbates their mental health \ncondition.” Smith Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 40, 6/28/16.  \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures cause NGRI Acquittees not to \nreceive a hearing immediately or within ten days of arrest.  \nThe record is silent on how long the 12 to18 individuals arrested while on conditional \nrelease were confined in parish jails before they were given a hearing. However, the fact that \nDefendants have not claimed that Mr. George’s experiences were unique, the history of long \nincarcerations for persons who have been found NGRI or incompetent to stand trial as \nexemplified in Advocacy Center for Elderly & Disabled v. Louisiana Dep’t of Health & \nHospitals and Cooper v. Kliebert, as well as the role that the lack of available bed space played \nin causing Mr. George’s incarceration in the first place, all strongly indicate that it is much more \nlikely than not that persons on conditional discharge who are alleged to have violated a term of \ntheir conditional release spend considerable time in jail following their arrest and incarceration. \nQUESTION 5: IS PLAINTIFF ENTITLED TO THE RELIEF REQUESTED IN HIS \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT (DOC. 42) WITHOUT ESTABLISHING THAT \n“POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES” VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION \nAND/OR ADA OR RA?  \n \nAs detailed above, Mr. George maintains that his arrests and periods of incarceration in \nquestion  were  the  result  of  Defendants  following  their  established  policies,  practices,  and \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nand shuffling, but he wasn't in shackles either. But he was -- he was definitely not walking in the manner \nthat he -- he was a few months prior. He was very disoriented. \n \nMartinez Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 43-44, 6/27/16. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 19 of 29\nprocedures.  The  existence  of  such  policies,  practices,  and  procedures,  however,  is  not  a \nnecessary element of his obtaining either damages or prospective relief for injury to his rights \nunder federal law.  \n  Constitutional Claims \nThe equitable relief requested by Mr. George for violations of his Due Process rights is \nnot dependent upon proof of the existence of policies, practices, or procedures as would be \nrequired for municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Instead, since he seeks prospective relief \nagainst state actors under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), Mr. George need show only \nthat: (1) Defendants violated his Constitutional rights; and (2) Defendants were either explicitly \ncharged with completing the unlawful action or were sufficiently connected to the unlawful \naction. See Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. 2001). \nMr. George prevails on his Due Process claim if he proves that Defendants deprived him \nof his liberty interest in freedom from detention or in mental health treatment. (See Pls.’ Pretrial \nBrief, Doc. No. 117-1 at 4–14.) Having satisfied the elements of those claims, the next question \nis whether Mr. George has met the standard for prospective relief under Ex parte Young. Since \nMr. George has sought relief against state actors, he need not prove the existence of a policy, \npractice or custom that was the moving force behind the deprivation of his rights under federal \nlaw. When a litigant seeks injunctive relief against a municipality, he must demonstrate the \nexistence of a “policy or custom” on behalf of the municipality. Los Angeles Cty. v. Humphries, \n562 U.S. 29, 36–37 (2010). In Humphries, the Court applied to injunctive relief the standard \npreviously used only for damages claims against municipalities, as laid out in Monell v. Dep’t of \nSocial Svcs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978). See also Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578 \n(5th Cir. 2001) (holding that Monell liability requires demonstration of municipal policymaker, \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 20 of 29\nexistence of a policy, and prof that policy was the “moving force” behind Plaintiff’s injury). \nThus, in the wake of Humphries, injunctive relief against a municipality under § 1983 can be had \nonly where the municipality has adopted a custom, policy, or practice that caused the Plaintiff’s \ninjury. 562 U.S. at 39. But the Humphries court limited its opinion to Monell claims against \nmunicipalities. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Courts of Appeal have ever required such a \nshowing for injunctive relief against a state official under Ex parte Young, the vehicle through \nwhich Mr. George seeks relief for the violations of his Constitutional rights.  \nIn Viet Anh Vo v. Gee, the Eastern District of Louisiana recently enjoined Louisiana \nclerks of court—who the court had determined were functioning as state actors for the purposes \nof that suit—from enforcing a state law that required applicants for a marriage license to first \nproduce a birth certificate. Civil Action No. 16-15639, 2017 WL 1091261 (E.D. La. Mar. 23, \n2017). Judge Ivan J. Lemelle rejected the clerks of courts’ claim that they could be liable for \ninjunctive relief only under a Monell theory: “the Monell requirements that defendants reference \napply where a municipal official acts in a local capacity, not where the official performs as a \nstate actor. . . . The appropriate standard that should be used in the instant matter is the one found \nin Ex parte Young.” Id. at *4. \nIn the Fifth Circuit, a claim under Ex parte Young is present where a state official acts, \nthreatens to act, or “at least ha[s] the ability to act to enforce an unconstitutional act.” Sonnier v. \nCrain, 649 F. Supp. 2d 484, 493 (E.D. La. 2009) (citing Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 421 \n(5th Cir. 2001)). The state official must also have “some connection” to the unlawful act. Ex \nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157 (1908). To gauge whether a sufficient connection between the \nstate official and the challenged conduct exists, courts look to “(1) the ability of the official to \nenforce the statute at issue under his statutory or constitutional powers; and (2) the demonstrated \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 21 of 29\nwillingness of the official to enforce the statute.” Sonnier, 649 F. Supp. 2d at 493. In Okpalobi, \nthe Fifth Circuit found Ex parte Young inapplicable where the defendant governor and attorney \ngeneral were incapable of enforcement of a challenged statute that expanded tort liability for \ndoctors who perform abortions. 244 F.3d at 427 (“The governor and attorney general have no \npower to redress the asserted injuries. In fact, under Act 825, no state official has any duty or \nability to do anything.”)  \nIn the case at bar, Defendants Tubbs, Brady, and Vosburg all directly participated in the \ndecisions to place Mr. George in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison instead of ELMHS, a \nhospital,  or  another  community  placement.  Defendants  LeBlanc,  Gibbs,  and  Starks  had \nsupervisory roles over Defendant Tubbs and were charged by law with monitoring individuals \nlike  Mr.  George  who  were  on  conditional  release  after  being  acquitted  as  NGRI.  Trial \nStipulations  ¶¶  8–11,  Pl.’s  Trial  Ex.  24.  Defendant  Gee  had  supervisory  authority  over \nDefendants  Brady  and  Vosburg.  As  agency  head  of  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Health \n(formerly “Department of Health and Hospitals” at the time of filing), Defendant Gee heads an \nagency charged with the monitoring and care of Mr. George. Id. ¶¶ 12–13 Not only did the \nDefendants thus have the power and ability to incarcerate Mr. George, but they also proved \nthemselves willing to take such an enforcement action on two separate occasions. Thus, all \nDefendants had a sufficient connection to the deprivation of Mr. George’s Due Process rights. \nRegardless of whether Defendants acted according to a formal policy, practice, or procedure, the \nDefendants either took direct action or were sufficiently connected to such action to violate Mr. \nGeorge’s Constitutional rights on two separate occasions.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 22 of 29\n  ADA / Section 504 \nTo obtain relief for violations of his rights under the Title II of the ADA and Sec. 504, \nMr. George need not demonstrate the existence of established policies, practices, and procedures \nthat were the cause of his injury. Delano-Pyle v. Victoria Cty., Tex., 302 F.3d 567, 575 (5th Cir. \n2002) (holding “neither a policymaker, nor an official policy must be identified for claims \nasserted under the ADA or the RA”). Defendants LDH and LDPSC waived sovereign immunity \nfor claims under the ADA and Sec. 504 through their receipt of federal funds. See Pl.’s Trial. Ex. \n24 (parties’ stipulation to Defendants LDH and LDPSC’s receipt of federal funding); Bennet-\nNelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that sovereign immunity for \nclaims under § 504 is waived via receipt of federal funds). Thus, Mr. George has a direct action \nagainst the Defendants through the enforcement provisions of Title II and Sec. 504. 42 U.S.C. § \n12133; 29 U.S.C. § 794a.  Therefore, he must prove only that he was discriminated against \nwithin the definition of those statutes and that declaratory judgment and permanent injunction \nare the proper remedies. Given the waiver of sovereign immunity, an analysis under Ex parte \nYoung is inapplicable to Mr. George’s ADA / Sec. 504 claims.   \nMr. George need not even make any showing as to the Defendants’ intent to justify \nequitable relief. See Midgett v. Tri-Cty. Metro. Transp. Dist. of Oregon, 254 F.3d 846, 851 (9th \nCir.  2001)  (“[E]quitable  remedies  for  violations  of  the  ADA  are  available  regardless  of  a \ndefendant's intent.) While proof of an existing, policy, practice, or procedure is unnecessary to \ngrant relief under the ADA or Sec. 504 for Mr. George to obtain equitable relief, he must \ndemonstrate  intentional  discrimination  to  justify  the  award  of  compensatory  damages.  See \nDelano-Pyle, 302 F.3d at 575.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 23 of 29\nQUESTION 6: WITH RESPECT TO PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS UNDER THE ADA AND \nSECTION 504, WHAT EFFECT OR WEIGHT SHOULD THE COURT GIVE TO THE \nJURY’S FINDINGS? \n \nThis Court asked for briefing on what weight the Court should place on the jury’s finding \nthat Defendants LDH and LDPSC did not discriminate against Mr. George on the basis of his \ndisability.  Mr. George admits that, as long as the jury’s finding stands, this Court is obliged to \napply to law to the facts as the jury found them.  Therefore, Mr. George respectfully moves this \nCourt to consider his renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) on the grounds \nthat no reasonable jury could have found that Mr. George was not discriminated against on the \nbasis of his mental illness. \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 allows this Court to consider renewed \nmotions for JMOL until 29 days after entry of judgment. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 governs a party’s motion for JMOL.  A movant may \nmove for JMOL at any time before the case is submitted to a jury.12  The court may grant a \nmotion for JMOL if a party has been fully heard on issue and the court finds that a reasonable \njury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.  If the \ncourt does not grant the motion for JMOL, the court is considered to have submitted the issue to \nthe jury, subject to the court’s later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion.  Where a \njury has issued a verdict, a movant may renew his motion for JMOL “no later than 28 days after \nentry of judgment.”  Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 50(b). \n  Standard for JMOL. \nA motion for JMOL raises only a question of law: “[w]hether there is any evidence \nwhich, if believed, would authorize a verdict against movant.”  Marsh v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n                                                      \n12 Mr. George moved for judgment as a matter of law before the case was submitted to the jury.  Trial Tr. vol. 3, 63, \n6/29/16. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 24 of 29\n175 F.2d 498, 500 (5th Cir. 1949).    “A judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if the facts \nand inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that reasonable people \ncould not arrive at a verdict to the contrary.”  Buchanan v. City of San Antonio, 85 F.3d 196, 198 \n(5th Cir. 1996).   In considering a motion for JMOL, the court is not to reweigh the evidence or \nassess the credibility of witnesses.  See Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 554 (U.S. \n1990).  Rather, the court must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the non-\nmovant and draw all inferences in the non-movant's favor.  Becker v. PaineWebber, Inc., 962 \nF.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir. 1992).  \n  Mr. George is entitled to a JMOL because Defendants did not present the \njury with a single shred of evidence to explain why Mr. George was \nincarcerated in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison in 2013 and \n2014 except because of his mental illness.  Therefore, no reasonable jury \ncould have found that there was any other cause for his incarceration or that \nhe was not discriminated against because of his mental illness. \nDefendants claim that they arrested and incarcerated Mr. George because his mental \nillness caused him to have “behaviors.” Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 210, 6/28/16; Brady Test., \nTrial Tr. vol. 1, 121-22, 6/27/16; Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, \nDoc. Rec. 81 at 14-15; Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Doc. \nRec. 152 at ¶¶ 38, 100.  Yet Defendants did not arrest and incarcerate Mr. George because those \n“behaviors” constituted a crime, or because they intended to get Mr. George treatment; in other \nwords, Mr. George’s “behaviors” alone do not justify Defendants’ actions.  Defendants arrested \nMr. George because of his “behaviors” paired with the fact that his disability is mental illness \nand it once caused him to be acquitted of criminal liability  \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 25 of 29\n1.  Defendants did not provide the jury with any evidence for a legal \nbasis for Mr. George’s arrest and incarceration. \nOne of the most basic, foundational tenants of our democracy is that the government \ncannot arrest or incarcerate an individual without a legal basis.  It is undisputed that Defendants \narrested and incarcerated Mr. George, an NGRI Acquittee not subject to pending criminal \nprosecution, in 2013 and 2014.  So while Mr. George bears the burden of proving by a \npreponderance that Defendants discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, upon \nproof of arrest and incarceration, Defendants logically must give the jury evidence of a legal \n(i.e., non-discriminatory) basis for that arrest and incarceration.  In this case, Defendants did not \npresent the jury with a shred of any such evidence. \nNotably, the only witness Defendants called to present evidence to the jury was an expert, \nDr. Harold Ginzburg, who testified solely on the issue of damages.  Dr. Ginzburg’s sole \ntestimony was that Mr. George’s mental and physical decline was a result of his previous drug \nuse, rather than the failure of Defendants to provide adequate mental health treatment while Mr. \nGeorge was in EBRPP.  Tr. Trans. Pgs. 26-27.  Dr. Ginzburg did not, and could not, present the \njury with any legal basis for why Mr. George was incarcerated in EBRPP in the first place. \nDefendants’ only attempts at providing a legal basis for arresting and incarcerating Mr. \nGeorge are a smattering of excuses that, upon even cursory inspection, fail to provide a non-\ndiscriminatory basis for arresting and incarcerating Mr. George.  Defendants’ focus on Mr. \nGeorge’s “behaviors” are a red herring.  While “behaviors” alone may sometimes be a basis for \narrest, Defendants cannot claim either of those legal bases in this case.  Mr. George’s \n“behaviors” were merely a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for Defendants arresting and \nincarcerating Mr. George.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 26 of 29\nFirst, at times Defendants claim they arrested and incarcerated Mr. George for his \n“behaviors,” some of which could have constituted crimes.  However, no reasonable jury could \nhave found that this was Defendant’s reason for arresting and incarcerating Mr. George.  If an \nindividual has “behaviors” that constitute a crime, the individual may be arrested and charged \nwith the crime, after which he would enjoy the due process protections afforded to an arrestee. \nDefendants admit they did not arrest and incarcerate Mr. George because his “behaviors” \nconstituted a crime; indeed, he was never charged with a crime for any events relevant to this \ncase.  Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 82, 6/27/16.   \nSecond, Defendants claim they arrested and incarcerated Mr. George to protect him and \nget him treatment.  However, when Defendants arrested Mr. George in 2013, they knew there \nwere no beds available at ELMHS, Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 84, 6/27/16; Brady Test., Trial \nTr. vol. 1, 124-25, 6/27/16, and they did not even attempt to find another psychiatric treatment \nfacility, Tubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 86, 6/27/16; Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 123, 6/27/16.  \nAfter incarcerating Mr. George in jail for the ostensible purpose of getting him treatment, \nDefendants did not follow up to see whether Mr. George was actually receiving treatment.  \nTubbs Test., Trial Tr. vol. 1, 83, 90, 6/27/16.   Even worse, when Defendants arrested Mr. \nGeorge again in 2014, they arrested him while he was receiving mental health care at ELMHS, \nand took him away from that treatment.  Brady Test., Trial Tr. vol. 2, 19-20, 6/28/16. Whether \nMr. George ever received treatment for the mental illness that was causing his “behaviors” was \nclearly of marginal concern, if of any concern, to Defendants. \nFinally, Defendants sometimes claim that they arrested and incarcerated Mr. George \nbecause there were no beds were available at ELMHS.  This last excuse is the most spurious of \nall.  First, it assumes that Defendants had the legal authority to detain Mr. George, which is of \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 27 of 29\ncourse the very question at issue.  Second, it misleads the fact-finder by suggesting that the \nnumber and availability of beds is not under Defendants’ control.  As evidenced by Advocacy \nCenter for Elderly & Disabled v. Louisiana Dep’t of Health & Hospitals, 731 F. Supp. 2d 603, \n627 (E.D. La. 2010) and Cooper v. Kliebert, 2014 WL 7334911 (M.D. LA 2014), the number, \navailability, and provision of beds at ELMHS is squarely under Defendant LDH’s authority.  The \nlack of beds at ELMHS is not a legal basis to arrest and incarcerate Mr. George when Defendants \nare the ones responsible for the lack of beds. \n2.  Defendants arrested and incarcerated Mr. George because he is a \nperson with mental illness whose mental illness has, in the past, \ncaused him to be found not guilty by reason of insanity. \nMr. George’s “behaviors” alone did not cause Defendants to arrest and incarcerate him.  \nThe crux of Mr. George’s ADA claim lies with the other condition necessary to his arrest and \nincarceration, which was that Mr. George is a member of a small class of individuals with \ndisabilities whose disability has caused them to break the law and whose disability happens to be \nmental illness.  Had Mr. George not had mental illness, or had he been acquitted of a crime based \non any other disability besides mental illness, he would not have been arrested and incarcerated. \nFirst, had Mr. George never been found NGRI, Defendants would not have arrested and \nincarcerated him, even if he had “behaviors.”   That is because if Mr. George’s mental illness \ncaused him to commit a crime he would be arrested by the police (not Defendants), and if it \ncaused him to be a danger to himself or others, Defendants would have moved to have him \ncivilly committed.   \nSecond, had Mr. George been acquitted on the basis of a disability other than mental \nillness, Defendants also would not have arrested and incarcerated him.  For example, if a diabetic \nwent into hypoglycemic shock and caused an automobile accident, the diabetic would be \nacquitted of reckless driving because she would not have been criminally responsible for her \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 160    09/06/17   Page 28 of 29\ndriving.  If, five years later, the diabetic had another hypoglycemic incident and fell against a \npasserby, Defendants would not then have arrested and incarcerated her for “behaviors” caused \nby her disability.  Even more, she would not be arrested and incarcerated for the purported \npurpose of receiving “treatment,” only to be deprived of insulin. \nYet, persons with both characteristics – those whose mental illness has caused them to be \nacquitted on that basis – are treated differently.  Even though the mentally ill arrestee and an \nNGRI Acquittee both may have “behaviors” caused by their mental illness, only an NGRI \nAcquittee is deprived of the due process protections of both an arrestee and a civil committee.  \nAnd even though the diabetic in the hypothetical above and an NGRI Acquittee are both found \nnot to be culpable for their actions on account of their disability, only the NGRI Acquittee can \nlater be arrested for “behaviors,” and only the NGRI Acquittee is incarcerated ostensibly to \nreceive “treatment” and then functionally deprived of the very treatment he needs.   \n  Mr. George presented the jury with evidence that Defendants discriminated against him \nby arresting and incarcerating him solely on the basis that he had mental illness (and the \nattendant “behaviors”) and had once been acquitted based on that mental illness.  Defendants, in \nturn, did not present a single shred of evidence to show that there was any legal basis for Mr. \nGeorge’s arrest and incarceration.  Therefore, no reasonable jury could have found that \nDefendants did not discriminate against Mr. George on the basis of his disability, mental illness. \nRespectfully submitted this 6th day of September, 2017. \n/s/ Ronald K.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nTRUSSELL GEORGE \n                       CIVIL  ACTION \nVERSUS         \n                NO. 14-338-JWD-SCR \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT \nOF PUBLIC SAFETY AND  \nCORRECTIONS, et al.     \nRULING AND ORDER \nThis matter is before the Court on the Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 34) filed by Defendant, \nCharles Vosburg, Ph.D. (“Dr. Vosburg” or “Defendant”), seeking to dismiss all claims against \nhim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Plaintiff, Trussell George, opposes the \nmotion  (Doc.  36),  and  Defendant  has  filed  a  reply  (Doc.  40).  After  careful  review  of  the \nsubmissions of the parties, the Second Amended Complaint, and the relevant law, the Court \ndenies the Defendant’s motion. \nI.  Relevant Factual Allegations and Background \nPlaintiff, a current inpatient at the Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (“ELMHS”), \nfiled a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  Title  II  of  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section \n504”) on May 28, 2014. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on September 24, \n2014. (Doc. 24). Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint was filed on December 23, 2014. (Doc. \n42). For purposes of this motion, the allegations in Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint will \nbe taken as true. \nPlaintiff has a history of mental illness, which includes diagnoses of Schizophrenia, \nBipolar  Disorder,  and  Psychosis  NOS.  (Doc.  42,  ¶4).  In  December  of  2008,  Plaintiff  was \n1 \n \n\nadjudged Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (“NGRI”) relative to a criminal offense (specifically, \nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm). (Id. at ¶46). By state court order and pursuant to state \nlaw,  Plaintiff  was  conditionally  released  for  a  term  of  five  years.1  (Id.).  The  court  order \nestablished numerous conditions on his release including requiring Plaintiff to reside in a group \nhome and receive adequate outpatient treatment and medications. (Id. at ¶47).   \nDuring his conditional release, Plaintiff resided in a group home under the supervision of \nthe  Division  of  Probation  and  Parole  of  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Public  Safety  and \nCorrections and the Community Forensic Services of the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals. (Id. at ¶4). On two separate occasions during his conditional release, Plaintiff was \narrested and placed in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. 2 (Id. at ¶¶55, 67). The basis for the \narrests was “violating the terms of his conditional discharge.” (Id.). Plaintiff asserts that no \ncriminal charges were filed against him pertaining to either incarceration. (Id. at ¶¶58, 72). \n Plaintiff alleges that “[o]nly persons with mental illness in Louisiana are intentionally \nsubjected to punishment by incarceration in correctional facilities in the absence of pending \ncriminal charges or a conviction of a criminal offense.” (Id. at ¶80).  This treatment of “persons \nfound NGRI on the basis of their mental illness” allegedly subjects them to punishment in \nviolation  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  and  constitutes  alleged  intentional  discrimination  in \nviolation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA. (Id. at ¶¶83, 91, 97, \n106). \nIn his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff names, among others, Charles P. Vosburg, \nPh.D., as a defendant. (Id. at ¶13). Dr. Vosburg is a consulting psychologist for the Community \nForensic Services (“CFS”) of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. (Id.). Plaintiff \n                                                            \n1 This term was later extended by one year which was to end on December 14, 2014. (Doc. 42, ¶61). \n2 The first instance occurred from July 29, 2013, through August 23, 2013. The second ran from July 1, 2014, \nthrough August 25, 2014.  \n2 \n \n\nasserts that Dr. Vosburg was a “key decision-maker in the arrest and incarceration of Plaintiff in \n2014.” (Id.).  \nPlaintiff alleges that the defendants, including Dr. Vosburg, “intentionally discriminate \nagainst persons found NGRI on the basis of their mental illness.” (Id. at ¶83).  Plaintiff further \nalleges  that  the  defendants,  including  Dr.  Vosburg,  “knowingly  and  intentionally  violated \nPlaintiffs’ [sic] constitutional and federal statutory rights.”(Id. at ¶84).    \nIn his Motion to Dismiss, Defendant Vosburg asserts that he is a “state health care \nprovider” and that all of Plaintiff’s claims against him fall within the confines of the Louisiana \nMedical Malpractice Act (“LMMA”), La. Rev. Stat. 40:1299.41, et seq. (Doc. 34-1, p. 1). Claims \nfalling under the LMMA must first be presented to a medical review panel. (Id.). Defendant, \ntherefore, contends that because Plaintiff’s claims against him have not been submitted to a \nmedical review panel, they must be dismissed as premature. (Id.). \nII.  Discussion \nA.  Relevant Standard \nWhen considering a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, the court must evaluate whether \nthe complaint meets the legal standard for pleading found in Rule 8, which requires “a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. Rule Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).  The  federal  pleading  rules  do  not  require  dismissal  of  a  complaint  containing  an \n“imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.” Johnson v. City of \nShelby, Mississippi, 574 U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 346, 346 (2014). \nInterpreting Rule 8(a) and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the Fifth Circuit explained: \n \nThe complaint (1) on its face (2) must contain enough factual matter (taken as \ntrue) (3) to raise a reasonable hope or expectation (4) that discovery will reveal \nrelevant  evidence  of  each  element  of  a  claim.  “Asking  for  [such]  plausible \ngrounds  to  infer  [the  element  of  a  claim]  does  not  impose  a  probability \n3 \n \n\nrequirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough facts to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal [that the elements of the claim \nexisted].” \n \nLormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 257 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007) (emphasis added)). \nAnalyzing this standard, our brother in the Western District stated: \nTherefore, while the court is not to give the “assumption of truth” to conclusions, \nfactual  allegations  remain  so  entitled.  Once  those  factual  allegations  are \nidentified, drawing on the court's judicial experience and common sense, the \nanalysis is whether those facts, which need not be detailed or specific, allow “the \ncourt  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  the \nmisconduct alleged.” Ashcroft, 129 S.Ct. at 1949, Twombly, 555 U.S. at 556, 127 \nS.Ct. at 1965. This analysis is not substantively different from that set forth in \nLormand, supra, nor does this jurisprudence foreclose the option that discovery \nmust be undertaken in order to raise relevant information to support an element of \nthe claim. The standard, under the specific language of Fed. Rule Civ. P. 8(a)(2), \nremains that the defendant be given adequate notice of the claim and the grounds \nupon which it is based. This standard is met by the “reasonable inference” the \ncourt must make that, with or without discovery, the facts set forth a plausible \nclaim for relief under a particular theory of law provided there is a “reasonable \nexpectation” that “discovery will reveal relevant evidence of each element of the \nclaim.” Lormand, 565 F.3d at 257, Twombly, 555 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. \n \nDiamond Services Corp. v. Oceanografia, S.A. De C.V., No. 10–177, 2011 WL 938785, at *3 \n(W.D.La. Feb.9, 2011) (citation omitted). \nIn Thompson v. City of Waco, Texas, 764 F.3d 500 (5th Cir. 2014), the Fifth Circuit \nrecently summarized the Rule 12(b)(6) standard as thus: \nWe accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view all facts in the light most \nfavorable  to  the  plaintiff.  We  need  not,  however,  accept  the  plaintiff's  legal \nconclusions as true. To survive dismissal, a plaintiff must plead enough facts to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility \nwhen  the  plaintiff  pleads  factual  content  that  allows  the  court  to  draw  the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Our \ntask, then, is to determine whether the plaintiff stated a legally cognizable claim \nthat is plausible, not to evaluate the plaintiff's likelihood of success. \n \nId. at 502–03 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n \n4 \n \n\nB.  Analysis \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff’s complaint sets forth negligence claims against him \nbecause Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “knew or should have known” of Plaintiff’s disabilities \nand need for mental health treatment. (Doc. 34-1, p. 5; see also Doc. 40, p. 1). Plaintiff asserts \nthat he is “not claiming negligence,” but rather is alleging that Defendant “intentionally deprived \nhim of his constitutional and federal statutory rights.” (Doc. 36, p. 3). \nIn Louisiana, two separate statutory schemes govern medical malpractice. Spradlin v. \nAcadia-St. Landry Med. Found., 758 So. 2d 116, 120 n.5 (La. 2000). The first is the Medical \nLiability for State Services Act (“MLSSA”), La. Rev. Stat. 40:1299.39, et seq., which governs \nmedical  malpractice  actions  against  state  health  care  providers.  The  second,  the  Louisiana \nMedical Malpractice Act (“LMMA”), La. Rev. Stat. 40:1299.41, et seq., governs actions against \nnon-state health care providers. Both statutory schemes require the plaintiff to submit his or her \nmedical malpractice claim to a medical review panel prior to instituting an action in state or \nfederal  court.  La.  Rev.  Stat.  40:1299.39.1;  La.  Rev.  Stat.  40.1299.47.  The  definition  of \n“malpractice” under both the MLSSA and the LMMA encompasses only those claims which \nsound in negligence; intentional torts are not considered “malpractice” under either scheme.3 \nThe Court recognizes that if Plaintiff had indeed asserted a state law claim of medical \nmalpractice, then, pursuant to Louisiana state law, that claim would be premature. However, \nPlaintiff’s claims against Defendant are based on alleged violations of his Constitutional and \nfederal statutory rights. (Doc. 42, p. 18-23). Indeed, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not assert a \nsingle state law claim. (Doc. 42). \n                                                            \n3 The MLSSA defines “malpractice” as “the failure to exercise the reasonable standard of care…in the provision of \nhealth care.” La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40:1299.39A(4) (West 2015). The LMMA defines “malpractice” as “any \nunintentional tort…based on health care or professional services rendered…by a health care provider.” La. Rev. \nStat. 40:1299.41A(13) (West 2015). \n5 \n \n\nThis  Court  has  recently  explained  that  the  Louisiana  Medical  Malpractice  Act  is \ninapplicable to a claim for the violation of constitutional civil rights because such a claim \n“involves intentional wrongdoing on the part of a state official.” Bailey v. E.B.R. Parish Prison, \n2015 WL 545706, at *3 (M.D.La. Feb. 9, 2015) (emphasis added). Other Louisiana district \ncourts have also so held. See Thomas v. James, 809 F.Supp. 448 (W.D.La. 1993) (plaintiff was \nnot required to submit his claim for intentional mistreatment to a medical review panel); Adams \nv. Foti, 2004 WL 241859, at *4 (E.D.La. 2004) (plaintiff’s claim of an intentional violation of \nhis civil rights was not required to be presented to a Louisiana medical review panel). Inasmuch \nas Plaintiff’s Title II and Section 504 claims allege intentional discrimination on the part of the \nDefendants, the Court finds that the LMMA and MLSSA are inapplicable to them as well. \nAccordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss is denied. \nPlaintiff has not asserted any claims sounding in negligence against Defendant. Indeed, \nPlaintiff has specifically stated that he “is not claiming negligence.” (Doc. 36, p. 3). However, if \nPlaintiff were to urge a claim based in negligence against Defendant Vosburg in the future, said \nclaim would clearly fall under the ambit of Louisiana’s medical malpractice statutes. And, as \nsuch, Plaintiff would be required to follow the procedures found in the MLSSA as to that claim.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 34) filed by Defendant Charles P. \nVosburg, Ph.D., is DENIED. \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on April 29, 2015. \nS\n   \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n  6 \n ",

Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures, which caused him \nto be arrested and incarcerated for almost a month, violated his rights under the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and subjected him to \nintentional discrimination in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section \n504”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”).  \nII.  JURISDICTION \n2.    This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, in \nthat this is an action arising under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nthe ADA, and Section 504.   \n3.    Venue is appropriate in this court under 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2) since the \nDefendants reside in this district. \nIII.  PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff  TRUSSELL  GEORGE  is  a  36-year-old  man  diagnosed  with  mental \nillness  and  a  significant  intellectual  and  developmental  disability.    He  resides  at  the  Stern \nCommunity Group Home located at 15626 Confederate Ave., Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He has \nreceived treatment for mental illness since the age of 12.  Mr. George’s mental health diagnoses \ninclude Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Psychosis NOS. He is currently on conditional \nrelease  under  the  supervision  of  the  Division  of  Probation  and  Parole  of  the  Louisiana \nDepartment  of  Safety  and  Corrections  and  the  Community  Forensic  Coordinators  of  the \nLouisiana  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals,  having  been  found  NGRI  to  a  charge  of \npossession of a weapon by a felon. \n5.  LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS is \nthe state agency responsible for monitoring and providing services to persons placed on \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 3 of 18\nconditional release or probation. The Division of Probation and Parole, which supervises Mr. \nGeorge’s conditional release, is located within the Department. The Department receives federal \nfinancial assistance and is a public entity as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) (B). \n6.  Defendant JAMES M. LEBLANC is Secretary of the Louisiana Department of \nPublic Safety and Corrections. Pursuant to La. R.S. 36:403, he is responsible for the \nadministration, control, and operation of the functions, programs, and affairs of the Department. \nHe is also responsible for, among other things, operating a probation and parole system, in \naccordance with the law. La. R.S. 36:401(B)(3). He is being sued in his official capacity only. \n7.   Defendant WHALEN GIBBS is the Assistant Secretary of the Louisiana \nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections. As such, he directs the operations of the Louisiana \nDivision of Probation and Parole. Pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.11(A), the Division of Probation \nand Parole provides for the investigation and supervision of adjudicated adult offenders. Also, \npursuant to La. Code Crim. P. 658(B)(1), the division is charged with supervising individuals \nwho have been placed on conditional release following a finding of NGRI. Whalen Gibbs is \nbeing sued in his official and individual capacities. \n8.   Defendant GERALD STARKS is the Director of the Louisiana Division of \nProbation and Parole. As such, he assists in the administration, development, and implementation \nof policies of the Division of Probation and Parole. Gerald Starks is being sued in his official and \nindividual capacities. \n9.  Defendant SCOTT TUBBS is an employee of the Louisiana Division of Probation \nand Parole, acting under the direction and supervision of Defendants Leblanc, Gibbs, and Starks. \nMr. Tubbs has responsibility for monitoring individuals placed on conditional discharge and \nimplementing the policies and procedures of the Division of Probation and Parole. On \ninformation and belief, he is a decision-maker regarding whether conditionally discharged \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 4 of 18\nindividuals whom he supervises are arrested and incarcerated. Scott Tubbs is being sued in his \nofficial and individual capacities. \nIV.  STATUTORY SCHEME \n10.  La. R.S. 14:14 states that an individual charged with a criminal offense is exempt \nfrom criminal responsibility for his behavior when “the circumstances indicate that because of a \nmental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and \nwrong with reference to the conduct in question.” \n11.  La. R.S. 28:2(20) defines a mentally ill person as “any person with a psychiatric \ndisorder which has substantial adverse effects on his ability to function and who requires care \nand treatment.” \n12.  When the defendant enters a plea of not guilty and NGRI, the court may appoint a \nSanity Commission, as provided in La. Code Crim. P. art. 644, to examine the defendant to \ndetermine whether he or she was “insane” at the time of the offense. La. Code Crim. P. arts. 650–\n652.  \n13.  A finding of NGRI means that the defendant has committed the acts that \nconstitute the crime; however, the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe defendant was insane at the time the acts were committed and thus cannot be held legally \nresponsible. La. Code Crim. P. art. 651. \n14.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 provides that if the defendant is found NGRI in a non-\ncapital case, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a private mental institution \napproved by the court and promptly hold a hearing to determine whether her or she can be \nreleased. When a verdict of NGRI is returned in a capital case, the court shall commit the \ndefendant to a state or private mental institution for care, custody, and treatment. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 5 of 18\n15.  Under the United States Constitution, an acquittee’s liberty may be curtailed only \nupon a finding that he is both dangerous and mentally ill.  However, implicit in the NGRI \nacquittal is a finding that the defendant is mentally ill. Therefore, at the initial hearing following \na NGRI finding, the only issue before the court in determining whether the acquittee should be \nreleased or committed, is whether the acquittee is dangerous.  \n16.  Under Louisiana’s statutory scheme, after a contradictory hearing, and considering \nthe Sanity Commission’s findings, the court may order the individual’s release or may place him \non conditional release. To place the insanity acquittee on conditional release, the court must find \nthat: \n (1)   Based on the factors which the court shall consider pursuant to \nArticle 657, he does not need inpatient hospitalization but needs outpatient \ntreatment, supervision, and monitoring to prevent his condition from \ndeteriorating to a degree that he would likely become dangerous to self and \nothers. \n \n(2)   Appropriate outpatient treatment, supervision, and monitoring are \nreasonably available. \n \n(3)   There is significant reason to believe that the insanity acquittee, if \nconditionally released, would comply with the conditions specified. \n \n(4)   Conditional release will not present an undue risk of danger to \nothers or self, as defined in R.S. 28:2(3) and (4). \n \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1. \n17.  If the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to \nothers or to himself, the court shall order him committed to a proper state mental institution or to \na private mental institution approved by the court for custody, care, and treatment. La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 654. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 6 of 18\n18.  Even if a defendant has been committed under La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 as a \nresult of having been found dangerous and presumed mentally ill based on the finding of NGRI, \nthe acquittee may later apply for discharge or conditional release.  \n19.  The insanity acquittee or the superintendent of the facility in which the he is being \nheld may petition the review panel for discharge. If the review panel determines that the acquittee \nis not a danger to himself or others, it can recommend to the court that he be discharged \nconditionally or unconditionally or placed on probation.  \n20.  Upon this recommendation or upon an acquittee’s petition, the court may hold a \ncontradictory hearing, La. Code Crim. P. art. 655(A), and order that the acquittee be \nconditionally released for a “fixed or an indeterminate period.” La. Code Crim. P. art. 657. \n  21.   In ordering a conditional release, the court “shall subject a conditionally released \ninsanity acquittee to such orders and conditions it deems will best meet the acquittee's need for \ntreatment, supervision, and monitoring and will best serve the interests of justice and society.” \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1(B). \n  22.  Typically, the conditional release orders impose restrictions and requirements, \nsuch as compliance with treatment, signing release of information forms, or refraining from the \nuse of alcohol, that do not in and of themselves constitute criminal conduct, even if violated. \n23.  When ordered, a conditional release must extend at least one year but not more \nthan five, although it can be extended after five years in one-year increments for good cause \nshown at a yearly contradictory hearing. La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.2. \n24.  The insanity acquittee on conditional release is supervised by the Division of \nProbation and Parole of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections.  \n25.  In addition, the Community Forensic Services (CFS) program of the Department \nof Health and Human Services, through its District Forensic Coordinators (also known as \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 7 of 18\n“conditional release program coordinators”), is responsible for the community treatment and \nmonitoring of individuals placed in the community on conditional release after being found \nNGRI. See La. Code Crim. P. 658(B). \n26.  Pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(1), if the division of probation and \nparole alleges that the acquittee violated or is about to violate a condition of his conditional \nrelease, he may be arrested and detained in a correctional facility under the provisions of La. \nCode Crim. P. art. 899, which applies to those who have been convicted of a crime and placed on \nprobation. \n27.  The court must be notified of violations and receive a recommendation from the \nconditional release program coordinator as to whether the conditional discharge should be \nrevoked or the insanity acquittee recommitted. La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(5). \n28.  Pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(6), a court, on its own motion or that of \nthe district attorney or probation officer, can order the acquittee arrested and incarcerated in order \nto determine whether the acquittee violated a term of his conditional discharge.  \n29.  Upon receiving a report and recommendation pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. \n658(B)(5), the court must “immediately” hold a hearing or transfer the case to the parish of \ncommitment, if different from that of the arrest, at which place the hearing should be held “as \nsoon as possible.”  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(6). \n30.  If the court determines that there has been a violation of a term of the conditional \nrelease or that the acquittee was about to violate the conditions of release, it may do any of the \nfollowing: \n(a)   Reprimand and warn the probationer. \n \n(b)   Order that supervision be intensified. \n \n(c)   Modify or add additional conditions to the probation. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 8 of 18\n \n(d)   Revoke the probation and recommit the probationer to a state \nmental institution, subject to consideration for discharge or release on \nprobation only after one year has elapsed from the date of revocation and \nin accordance with the procedure prescribed in Articles 655 through 657 \nfor a first application and hearing.  \n \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 658(C). \n \n31.  If an acquittee violates the terms of conditional release, there are options under \nLouisiana law other than arrest and incarceration. If a person on conditional release or otherwise \nprobated under the aforementioned code provisions is in need of acute, i.e. short-term, \nhospitalization and is not charged with a new criminal offense, he may be voluntarily admitted \npursuant to La. R.S. 28:52 or admitted by emergency certificate pursuant to La. R.S. 28:53 to the \nFeliciana Forensic Facility or to another suitable treatment facility, with subsequent notice to the \ncourt. La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(4). \n32.  The court can completely discharge an acquittee from conditional release “after \nthe expiration of one year in a supervised conditional release program only on recommendation \nof the director of the division of probation and parole or the administrator of the conditional \nrelease program or on other proper evidence of expected outpatient compliance with any \ncontinued treatment recommendations, and after a contradictory hearing with the district \nattorney.” La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(D). The court may also grant an application for discharge \nwith no probation period. La. Code Crim. P. art. 654. \nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n33.  In 1997 and 1999, respectively, Mr. George was allowed to plead guilty, despite \nhis  mental  illness  and significant  cognitive disabilities, to  charges of criminal  trespass and \npossession of a schedule II substance.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 9 of 18\n            34.       In 2008, based upon his prior convictions of criminal trespass and possession of a \nschedule II substance, Mr. George was charged with possession of a firearm by a felon.  \n35.  Following  his  arraignment,  the  court  initially  referred  his  case  to  a  Sanity \nCommission to determine whether he was competent to stand trial.  \n36.   The Sanity Commission found that Mr. George was not competent to stand trial. \n37.  The recommendation of the Sanity Commission was not adopted by the court. \nInstead, his case was again referred to the Sanity Commission, this time to determine whether he \nwas NGRI. \n38.  In response, the Sanity Commission recommended that Mr. George was NGRI.  \n39.  On December 15, 2008, following a finding that Mr. George was NGRI to a \ncharge of possession of a firearm by a felon, the court ordered that he be conditionally released \npursuant to La. C. Crim. P. art. 657.1, for a period of five years, provided he receive adequate \noutpatient treatment, supervision, and monitoring. \n40.   In ordering Mr. George’s conditional release, the court established, among other \nthings, the following conditions: \na)   That he reside at Progressive Group Home, 1334 Frances Harriet \nDrive, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  \n \nb)   That he attend the local mental health clinic in Baton Rouge, \nLouisiana, and follow the treatment recommendations prescribed by his \ntreating physician, as well as comply and cooperate with sessions of \ncounseling and/or treatment, oral and/or injectable medications as ordered \nby the attending physician.  \n \nc)   That he report to the local probation office within twenty-four (24) \nhours of release from jail, excluding non-business days. \n \nd)   That he be subject to the outpatient tracking/monitoring services to \nbe provided by the Community Forensic Services Program of the \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 10 of 18\ne)   That he sign all consent for release of information forms and \nagencies involved in the medical/psychiatric care of the defendant shall \nreport on a regular basis to the District Forensic Coordinator or State \nProbation Officer, who were authorized to have access to progress notes, \nattendance sheets, medication order sheets, and pertinent medical, \npsychiatric, psychological, and neurological consultations. \n \nf)   That he refrain from the consumption of alcohol and all illicit \ndrugs and from frequenting places where alcohol/illicit drug sales and \nconsumption occur. \n \ng)   That the Aftercare Provider notify the District Forensic \nCoordinator and/or State Probation Officer of any positive drug screens or \nproblems related to treatment and/or behavior problems. \n \n41.  Although the location of the group home has changed since 2008, Mr. George has \ncontinuously resided in a group home setting as required by his conditional release order.  \n42.  The group homes he has resided in are operated by Progressive Health Care \nProviders (PHP) and are Intermediate Care Facilities for People with Developmental Disabilities \n(“ICF-DD”). ICF-DD is one of a number of residential services options operated under the \nauspices of Louisiana’s Department of Health and Hospitals’ Developmental Disabilities \nServices System. See La. R.S. 28:451.1 et seq.  As is typical of many group homes, \napproximately five other individuals, all of whom have a developmental disability and many of \nwhom have mental illnesses, reside in the PHP facilities with Mr. George. The daily operations \nof these group homes are run by paid staff and all of its residents must be in active treatment. \n43.  During  the  five  years  that  Mr. George resided in  the PHP  Group Home, he \nreceived an array of mental health services, including a day activities program and a Behavioral \nSupport  Plan  to  address  behaviors  that  are  a  manifestation  of  his  disability.  Mr.  George’s \nmedication regimen has consisted of Risperdal injections every two weeks, Klonopin, Risperdal, \nDepakote, Trazodone, and Cogentin.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 11 of 18\n44.  According to his Behavioral Support Plan, due to his mental illness, Mr. George \non some occasions engages in verbal aggression and non-compliance within the Group Home \nand the day program he attends during the week. His Behavioral Support Plan notes that on \noccasion, he may engage in outbursts and “threatening” episodes when his medication is not \ncorrect. \n45.  The behaviors that Mr. George manifests are typical of behaviors exhibited by \nmany other men with mental illness and developmental disabilities residing in the close quarters \nof a group home. \n            46.      Six months prior to the end of his conditional discharge term, Mr. George was \nhospitalized and deprived of his needed medication regimen.  \n47.  As a consequence of not having his medication, Mr. George allegedly engaged in \nverbal outbursts and threatening behavior, which included yelling at a staff member that he “had \nbetter get me a hamburger” and telling another resident at the Group Home that he was going to \nkill him. These statements were reported to Scott Tubbs, the Probation and Parole Officer, who \nmonitors Mr. George’s conditional discharge.  \n  48.   At the request of Mr. Tubbs, employees of Mr. George’s Day Program drove him \nto the Probation Officer’s office, where he was arrested.   \n49.  Mr. George was consequently incarcerated from July 29, 2013 to August 23, 2013 \nat the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on the basis of the alleged violation of his conditional \ndischarge.  \n            50.      No criminal charges were ever filed against Mr. George for any behavior that \noccurred on or before July 29, 2013. \n51.  Mr. Tubbs knew, or should have known, of Mr. George’s disabilities and his \nmedication regimen.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 12 of 18\n            52.     While incarcerated, Mr. George was deprived of his medication and, as a result, \nbecame very nervous and paranoid.  \n53.  Mr. George was not provided with an opportunity to post bail, to have an attorney \nappointed for him, or to be read his rights. At no time during his incarceration was Mr. George \nnotified of the charges against him or how long he would be held. Mr. George was able to have \nvisitors, but he was unaware of this fact until just before he was released. \n            54.     During most of his incarceration, Mr. George was isolated and placed in lockdown \nfor “mental reasons,” which meant that he only had 15 minutes to leave his cell to take a shower, \nhad no exercise time, and was restricted in his use of the canteen and in his ability to receive \nreading material. \n  55.  Mr. George remains on conditional release and continues to exhibit behaviors \nrelated to his mental illness. Therefore, he is at substantial risk of future incarceration for \nbreaching conditions of his release. \n56.    The primary purpose for incarcerating individuals in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities is punishment. Such facilities do not have the capacity to provide the mental health \ntreatment to individuals found NGRI. \n57.  The Department of Public Safety and Corrections Defendants, as a matter of \npolicy, practice, and procedure, arrest and incarcerate individuals placed on conditional release \nfollowing a NGRI determination for merely violating a condition of their release. \n58.  Only persons with mental illness in Louisiana are intentionally subjected to \npunishment by incarceration in correctional facilities in the absence of pending criminal charges \nor a conviction of a criminal offense. \n59.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, acted under color of state law. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 13 of 18\n60.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, have acted and continue to act \nwith deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s liberty interests.  \n61.  Defendants intentionally discriminate against persons found NGRI on the basis of \ntheir mental illness by confining them, or causing them to be confined, in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities where they are subjected to punishment and unable to access appropriate mental health \nservices. \n62.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, knowingly and intentionally \nviolated Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights. \n63.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been deprived of \nhis liberty by incarceration in a Louisiana correctional facility and has suffered significant \nirreparable damage to his mental health.   \n64.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ policies, practices, and \nprocedures, Plaintiff, who is still on conditional release, is in significant jeopardy of again being \nsubjected to irreparable harm by being incarcerated in a correctional facility and deprived of his \nmental health treatment and services. \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n  A.  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS  \n65.    Under the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution, only individuals \nwho have been properly charged with or convicted of a crime may be punished by incarceration \nin prison or jail. Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 369 (1983).  \n66.  “[D]ue process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson v. Indiana, \n406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).  \n67.     For insanity acquittees, the purpose of commitment is to provide treatment of \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 14 of 18\ntheir mental illness in a manner that is not punitive, and to protect society from dangerous \nbehavior that may result from that mental illness.  \n68.  For insanity acquittees, when either dangerousness or mental illness ceases to \nexist, the State has no legitimate interest in commitment.  \n69.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which cause individuals with \nmental illness who have been found NGRI and able to be released on specified conditions \nwithout danger to themselves or others, to be confined in correctional facilities for the sole \nreason that they are alleged to have violated a condition of their release, violates their rights \nunder the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution. \n70.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658 (B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899 are unconstitutional \non their face to the extent that they authorize state officials to arrest and incarcerate persons \nfound NGRI and placed on conditional release merely because they are alleged to have violated a \ncondition of their release. \n71.  As set forth in this Complaint, Defendants’ actions have violated, and in the \nabsence of injunctive relief are again likely to violate, Plaintiff’s rights under the Due Process \nClause to the United States Constitution.  \nB.  VIOLATIONS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n72.  As a qualified person with disabilities, Plaintiff is entitled to the protections and \nbenefits of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which provides that \"no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n73.  Regulations implementing the ADA prohibit a public entity from providing any \naid, benefit, or service, directly or through contractual licensing, or other arrangements that (i) \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 15 of 18\nDeny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the \naid, benefit, or service;  (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;  \n(iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as \neffective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to \nreach the same level of achievement as that provided to others; and (iv) Provide different or \nseparate aids, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals \nwith disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified \nindividuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided \nto others. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i-iv). \n74.  The ADA's implementing regulations further provide that \"a public entity may \nnot, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of \nadministration: (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability….” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n75.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658 (B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899, on their face, \nviolate the ADA and are contrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution to \nthe extent that they authorize state officials to arrest and incarcerate persons found NGRI and \nplaced on conditional release merely because they are alleged to have violated a condition of \ntheir release. \n76.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which have caused, and in the \nabsence of injunctive relief are likely to cause, Plaintiff to be confined in a correctional facility \nfor the sole reason that he allegedly violated a condition of his conditional release, violate Title II \nof the ADA.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 16 of 18\nC.  VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n  77.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that \"[n]o otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving federal financial assistance . . ..\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n78.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which cause individuals with \nmental illness who have been found NGRI to be confined in state correctional facilities following \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility or solely because they are alleged to have violated a \ncondition of their discharge, denies them the opportunity to effectively participate in or benefit \nfrom mental health services and subjects them to punishment on the basis of their disability. \n79.  Section 504's regulations also prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance \nfrom \"utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration ... (i) [t]hat have the effect of subjecting \nqualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap ….\" 45 C.F.R. § \n84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(I). \n80.  Defendants are utilizing criteria and methods of administration that subject \npersons with mental illness, such as Plaintiff, to discrimination on the basis of disability, by \narresting and incarcerating individuals in state correctional facilities who have been placed on \nconditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to have \nviolated a condition of their discharge. \n81.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899, on their face, \nviolate Section 504 and are contrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States to the extent \nthat they authorize state officials to arrest and incarcerate persons found NGRI and placed on \nconditional release merely because they are alleged to have violated a condition of their release. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 17 of 18\n82.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which have caused, and in the \nabsence of injunctive relief are likely to cause, Plaintiff to be confined in a correctional facility \nfor the sole reason that he allegedly violated a condition of his conditional release, violate \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nVII.  PRAYERS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against the Defendants as follows: \nA.  Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be shown at trial. \nB.  Issue an order granting Plaintiff permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \nDefendants from arresting and incarcerating individuals in correctional facilities who have been \nplaced on conditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to \nhave violated a condition of their discharge; \n  C.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures \nof arresting and incarcerating individuals in state correctional facilities who have been placed on \nconditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to have \nviolated a condition of their discharge violates Plaintiff’s rights under the Due Process Clause of \nthe United States Constitution, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990; \nD.  Issue a declaratory judgment that La. Code Crim. P. art. 658 (B) and La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 899 are, on their face, unconstitutional under the Due Process and Supremacy \nClauses of the United States constitution to the extent that they authorize state officials to arrest \nand incarcerate persons found NGRI and placed on conditional release merely because they are \nalleged to have violated a condition of their release. \nE.  Award Plaintiff his reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; \nF.  Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 1    05/28/14   Page 18 of 18\n  Respectfully submitted this 28th day of May 2014. \n \nTRUSSELL GEORGE  \n \nBy and through his attorneys \n \n            /s/ Ronald K.

(Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 78:2–79:25.) \nOn or about 7–15–13, he got aggressive with a staff \n  \n68.

At this point, Tubbs conferred with Brady, who in \n  \nturn consulted with Vosburg. (Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at \n76. Tubbs testified that he did not decide to arrest George \n84:2–5; 124:17–23.)

Plaintiff stresses that, at the time of George’s arrest, \n   Tubbs and Brady were well aware that there was a direct \n81. Defendants counter that his conduct, beginning in  relationship between the medication George was taking \nMay 2013 and escalating up until the time of his arrest on  for his mental illness and the behavior that led to his \nJuly 29, 2013, was substantially worse and had not been  arrest.

First, in \n\nresponse to direct questioning of the Court outside the    \npresence of the jury, both Tubbs and Brady testified that  96. Plaintiff faults Tubbs and Brady for not checking on \nwhen a NGRI acquittee threatens violence, they believed  Plaintiff  while  in  EBRPP.

So by  your way  of thinking, there were two    \nchoices: first ELMHS, if there was a bed available,  97. For reasons not explained in the record, Tubbs waited \nbut if not, your only other choice was the parish  until August 12, 2013, 15 days after George had been \nprison?  incarcerated at EBRPP, before moving for revocation and \nrequesting a hearing.

Until we could go in front of the judge  5; Tubbs Test., Doc. 148 at 77:24–78:8.) \nand the judge could make a decision on what to do    \nwith him. \n98. It appears from the record that George was released \nafter a hearing before Judge Moore on August 23, 2013, \n(Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 at 211:1–5.) \nnot in response to  Tubbs’ motion but “only after the \n  \n[George’s lawyer] filed a petition for habeas corpus on his \n91. Furthermore, said Tubbs, “At that time when he’s \nbehalf in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of East \nthreatening  violence towards staff ...

Defendants admit \nwould be—in my opinion, would be the only place that \nthat, “[a]s a result of the [habeas corpus] hearing, Judge \ncould handle him at that point.” (Id. at 208:22–24.)

In addition, Tubbs testified that he didn’t consider \nanother  hospital  for  George  because  that  hospital \nwouldn’t be able to transfer George to court “to address  I.

After his release of August 23, 2013, George was \n93. Defendants also argue that, even if Tubbs or Brady  taken  directly  to  Baton  Rouge  General  Hospital  and \nhad tried to get George admitted to a private hospital, it is  involuntarily committed. (Brady Test., Doc. 149 at 16:11–\nunlikely they would have been successful “since nobody  14.) \nwants  ELMHS’s  patients,  particularly  those  having    \nforensic  involvement,  because  they  worry  about  their  100.

(Tubbs Test., Doc. 149 \n149. And although a warrantless arrest is authorized by  at  208:2–24.)  However,  this  seems  to  be  belied  by \nLa. Code Crim.

The  only  evidence  in  the  record  regarding  any  Brady and Tubbs were able to have George admitted to \ncontact with the court about George’s arrest on the day of  private hospitals in both May and July 2015, and, indeed \nhis arrest shows that Tubbs “[c]alled Judge Moore[’s]  on August 23, 2013, although his conduct during that time \n\nwas  similar  to  that  which  provoked  his  arrest  and  149 at 115:4–16); Depakote (a mood stabilizer) 8% in the \nincarceration.  morning and 76% at night (Id. at 124:7–13); Cogentin (to \n   treat  side  effects  of  anti-psychotic  drugs),  8%  in  the \n156.

But Plaintiff has made clear  191. The Court finds that Tubbs, Brady and Vosburg had \nthat “issues of length of incarceration before release [and]  reasonable and probable cause to believe that, for this \nlength of incarceration without or before a hearing” are  reason, George had violated and was likely to continue to \nnot before the Court.

But even if the    \nlength of George’s stay was an issue before the Court,   \nthese two instances do not prove a policy, procedure, or \npractice. \n   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n186.

Id.  at  1149.  As  Neiberger \n273.  Plaintiff’s  central  argument  is  that  Defendants \nobserves, the individuals in Youngberg merited “greater \nmaintained a “policy, practice and procedure” of arresting \nconstitutional  vigilance  from  their  caretakers  than  ... \nand  incarcerating  NGRI  acquittees  for  violating  their \nordinary prisoners,” but Youngberg was also wary “of \nconditions of release when no crime had been committed. \nplacing too onerous a burden on these officials.” Id. at \n(Doc. 42, ¶¶ 1, 77, 78, 80, 86, 91, 93–94.) He argues that \n1150 (citing Shaw by Strain v. Strackhouse, 920 F.2d \na policy has been proven primarily by two facts: first, the \n1135, 1144–45 (3d Cir. 1990)). \ntwo incidents in which George himself was arrested and \n  \nincarcerated; and second, the testimony  of  Tubbs that \n268.

He  also \nbetween  a  very  deferential  “deliberate  indifference” \nattempts  to  support  his  argument  by  maintaining  that \nstandard and more searching “compelling” or “substantial \nDefendants  “haven’t  claimed  that  Mr.  George’s \nnecessity” tests.

In support of his argument that he has factually \nand resulting inability to provide for their own wellbeing; \nproved a policy, practice or procedure, Plaintiff cites a \n(2)  the  fact  that  they  have  not  been  found  legally \nrecord  in  another  case  dealing  with  persons  found \nresponsible for criminal conduct and have a greater liberty \nincompetent to stand trial, Advocacy Center for Elderly \ninterest than an individual convicted of a crime; (3) their \nand Disabled v.

Plaintiff also points the Court to a decision of this \ncare; and (4) officials’ general ability to make deliberate, \nCourt denying a motion to dismiss. See generally Cooper, \nunhurried decisions about their care. \n2014 WL 7334911. Yet neither of these cases provides \n  \nthe factual support for the argument made here. \n270. The Court is therefore persuaded, at least as an initial \n  \nmatter, to use  Youngberg’s balancing and professional \n275. While the Court certainly has concerns with the \njudgment  standards  to  determine  whether  Defendants’ \nextended incarcerations of George without a hearing, it is \nconduct “shocks the conscience,” as is required to give \nPlaintiff’s burden to prove his allegations, including the \nrise to a due process claim. \nallegation  that  there  was  a  “policy,  procedure  and \n  \npractice.” It is not the Defendants’ burden to show these \n271. Because there is a reasonable argument, however, \ntwo incidents were unique. \nthat one of the aforementioned “deliberate indifference” \n  \nstandards  applies,  the  court  will  also  consider  the \n[10]276. As noted above, the Court finds that two arrests \napplication of these standards in the alternative. See, e.g., \ndo not establish a “policy, practice or procedure.” While \nTerry, 232 F.Supp.2d at 943–44 (balancing state interests \nthe two share the common fact that George was arrested \nagainst  incompetent  pretrial  detainees’  interests  in \nand incarcerated for violating a condition of his release \ntreatment and freedom and noting, in the alternative, that \n(being physically assaultive and aggressive and presenting \nthe failure to provide restorative treatment was deliberate \na danger to others), the two incidents are also significantly \nindifference by the state agency). \ndifferent. The first involved his conduct while on release \n  \nin a group home and at his day program while the second \n \noccurred at ELMHS. More importantly, however, even if \n\nidentical,  the  number  of  incidents  is  insufficient  to  George arrested and placed in East Baton Rouge Parish \nestablish a policy, procedure or practice.

Defendants, on the other hand, argue that “when an \narrest is made by state officers acting pursuant to state \nauthority, ‘the requisite standard of probable cause for a \nH.

At  trial,  there  was  an  abundance  of  evidence \nshowing that first, George was arrested because he posed \na potential danger to others. (See, e.g., Brady Test., Doc.

Second, the uncontradicted testimony at trial \nrenewed  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  is \nwas that George was placed at EBRPP because there were \nDENIED  and  Plaintiff’s  claims  are  DENIED  in  all \nno beds available at ELMHS. (See, e.g., Tubbs Test., Doc. \nrespects.

Finally, there was \nconformity with Rule 58. \nevidence presented to the jury that, while not identical to \n  \nthe care he would have received at ELMHS, nonetheless, \nhe received the care of a psychiatrist and a social worker \nand received at least some of his psychiatric medicines \nAll Citations \nwhile at EBRPP. (See, e.g., Burns Test., Doc. 149 at \n106:13–110:17, 145:4–9).  272 F.Supp.3d 855 \n  \n \n311. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable \nto the Defendants, a reasonable jury could conclude, as \nFootnotes \n \n1  Because an amended complaint supplants and replaces prior complaints, Eubanks v. Parker Cty. Commr’s Court, 1995 WL 10513, \nat *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 3, 1995); Hall v. Louisiana, 983 F.Supp.2d 820, 832 (M.D. La. 2013), the Court considers Plaintiff’s Second \n \nAmended Complaint (Doc. 42, in globo ) to be the operative pleading in this action. \n \n2  Since the filing of these complaints, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals has been re-designated the Louisiana \nDepartment of Health. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 36:251. \n \n \n3  Where appropriate, a public official’s successor is automatically substituted as a party consistent with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 25(d). \n \n \n4  Because the Court denies George’s claims on the merits, see infra, it does not discuss this issue. \n \n \n5  In his trial testimony, Tubbs testified that this incident occurred on July 25, 2017. (Doc. 148 at 80:10–13.) This discrepancy is not \nimportant to the Court’s analysis. \n \n \n\n6  As is discussed, infra, this affidavit and motion were not executed and filed until August 12, 2013. \n \n \n7  Nonetheless, in Pl.’s Trial Ex. 19 at TG000206–207, Tubbs classified George’s conduct as a “Level 3 violation—Misdemeanor \nactivity (serious violent).” Tubbs continued, “[George] threatened staff and other clients with violence for the 3d [sic] time. The \n \ngroup home wanted him out due to his behavior.” Tubbs classified his response to George’s conduct as “Level 3 Action—\nArrest/Detain with Custodial Treatment... Warrant/Motion and Order to Revoke.” \n \n8  While the questioning refers to George being released on August 21, 2013, the actual date of release was, according to the \nstipulation of the parties, August 23, 2013. (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 24 at 4, No. 17.) This discrepancy plays no role in the Court’s analysis. \n \n \n9  George “shoved male staff[,] not causing physical harm;” threatened “homicidal ideations” [sic] towards staff members and \n“accused a male staff member of trying to poison him.” (Pl.’s Trial Ex. 5 at TG000006.) \n \n \n10  In George’s case, the staff at Progressive attempted to bring him his medications on the date of his July 2013 arrest, but “staff \nwere turned around.” (Hope Test., Doc. 149 at 194:16.) \n \n \n11  While not relevant to the Court’s decision, the Court also notes that there was no evidence as to how long the acquittees, in \nthese other arrests and incarcerations remained incarcerated before a court hearing was held or how long these individuals \n \nremained incarcerated before being released to ELMHS or other psychiatric facility. There was no policy, practice or procedure \ndemonstrated in this regard either. \n \n12  This Court has previously held in this matter that neither La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B) nor La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 899 are \nunconstitutional on their face. (See Doc. 124 at 22–24.) \n \n \n13  While not determinative in this case, the Fifth Circuit in Poree felt “compelled to note” that Louisiana’s statutory requirement \nthat confinement is justified only when there is a “reasonable expectation that there is a substantial risk” that the acquittee will \n \ncause harm, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 28:2(3) and (4), is a more demanding standard than that applied by the state court and \napproved of by the Fifth Circuit. 866 F.3d at 249–50. \n \n14  Defendants suggest they haven’t done so because Plaintiff’s claim tried to the Court was limited to the sole issue of whether \ndeclaratory and injunctive is justified based on the alleged unconstitutional policies, practices and procedures of Defendants in \n \narresting and incarcerating NGRI acquittees for violations of conditions of release alone, when no crime has been committed. \n(Doc. 161 at 1–2, 9–10.) This contention was repeated in oral argument. \n \n15  The Court emphasizes its concern regarding George’s lengthy stays in EBRPP without a hearing or earlier placement in a mental \nhospital. The Court believes that “continued detention based on dangerousness and mental illness is only constitutional when \n \nthere has been a sufficiently prompt and full adversarial hearing where the State has proved by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the individual is demonstrably dangerous to the community.” Ward, 2017 WL 1611761 at *4 (emphasis added); see also \nLuna, 554 F.Supp. at 71–76. There is the additional issue of whether such prolonged incarceration in the absence of adequate \npsychiatric care is punishment. But, as counsel for Defendants understandably pointed out at oral argument, because the length \nof George’s incarcerations and quality of medical care were not (and are not) issues before the Court, Defendants did not fully \naddress these issues at trial or in briefing. \n \n16  The Court finds that all three were “professionals” as defined by Youngberg: someone “competent, whether by education, \ntraining or experience, to make the particular decision at issue.” 457 U.S. at 323, n. 30, 102 S.Ct. 2452. \n \n \n \n ",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \nTRUSSELL GEORGE  CIVIL ACTION \nNO. 3:14-00338-JWD-EWD \nVERSUS \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF \nPUBLIC SAFETY AND \nCORRECTIONS, ET AL \nORDER ON MOTION IN LIMINE \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nBefore the Court is the the Defendants' Motion in Limine to Exclude Plaintiffs Expert \nWitness Delany M. Smith, M.D (\"Motion\"), (Doc. 10 7), filed by Defendants, and opposed by \nMr. Trussell George (\"George\" or \"Plaintiff'), (Doc. 116). In the Motion and the Opposition \n(\"collectively, \"Motions\"), Defendants and Plaintiff (collectively, \"Parties\") contest a single \nissue: whether Plaintiffs expert should be permitted to testify pursuant to Federal Rules of \nEvidence 403 and 703.1 Having considered the Parties' arguments, for the reasons more fully \nexplained below, this Court denies the Motion. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  STANDARD \nPursuant to Rule 702, \"a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, \nexperience, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" if its preconditions \n1 In this order, any and all references to \"Rule\" or \"Rules\" are to the Federal Rules of Evidence \nunless otherwise noted. \n\nare met. FED. R. Evm. 702. Rule 702, however, does not render all expert testimony admissible. \nUnited States v Scavo, 593 F.2d 837, 844 (8th Cir. 1979). Rather, beyond being subject to the \nRule's helpfulness requirement, expert testimony can still be excluded per Rule 403. FED. R. \nEvro. 403; United States v Green, 548 F.2d 1261, 1270 (6th Cir. 1977). Entirely discretionary, \nRule 403 allows a court to \"exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially \noutweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, \nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" \nThis is a Daubert challenge based on the expert's alleged failure to use an accepted \nmethodology and her opinion's alleged lack of an adequate factual foundation, (Doc. 107-1 at 2). \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 \n(1993). When Daubert is invoked, a district court may, but is not required, to hold a hearing at \nwhich the proffered opinion may be challenged. Carlson v. Bioremedi Therapeutic Sys., Inc., No. \n14-20691,2016 WL 2865256, at *7, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 8951, at *11 (5th Cir., May 16, \n2016). However, when no hearing is held, \"a district court must still perform its gatekeeping \nfunction by performing some type of Daubert inquiry.\" Id. \"At a minimum, a district court must \ncreate a record of its Daubert inquiry and 'articulate its basis for admitting expert testimony.\"' \nId.  (quoting Rodriquez v. Riddell Sports, Inc., 242 F.3d 567, 581 (5th Cir. 2001)). \nThe role of the trial court is to serve as the gatekeeper for expert testimony by making the \ndetermination of whether the expert opinion is reliable. As the Fifth Circuit has held: \n[W]hen expert testimony  is offered, the trial judge must perform a  screening \nfunction to ensure that the expert's opinion is reliable and relevant to the facts at \nissue in the case . . .. Daubert went on to make \"general observations\" intended to \nguide a district court's evaluation of scientific evidence. The nonexclusive list \nincludes \"whether [a theory or technique] can be (and has been) tested,\" whether it \n\"has been subjected to peer review and publication,\" the \"known or potential rate \nof error,\"  and  the  \"existence  and  maintenance  of standards  controlling  the \ntechnique's operation,\" as well as \"general acceptance.\" ... The Court summarized: \n2 \n\nThe inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 is, we emphasize, a flexible one. Its \noverarching  subject  is  the  scientific  validity  and  thus  the  evidentiary \nrelevance  and  reliability-of  the  principles  that  underlie  a  proposed \nsubmission.  The  focus,  of course,  must  be  solely  on  principles  and \nmethodology, not on the conclusions that they generate. \nWatkins v. Telsmith, Inc., 121 F.3d 984,988-89 (5th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted). \nThe cases following Daubert have expanded the factors and explained the listing is neither \nall-encompassing nor is every factor required in every case. See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 \nU.S. 136, 143 (1997); Guy v. Crown Equip. Corp., 394 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir. 2004). Indeed, \ncourts may look to other factors. Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146. \nThis Court has explained: \nThe admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702 \nand Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., .. . which provide that the court \nserves as a gatekeeper, ensuring all scientific testimony is relevant and reliable. \nThis gatekeeping role extends to all expert testimony, whether scientific or not. . . \n.  Under  Rule  702,  the  court  must  consider  three  primary  requirements  in \ndetermining the admissibility of expert testimony:  1) qualifications of the expert \nwitness;  2) relevance of the testimony; and 3) reliability of the principles and \nmethodology upon which the testimony is based. \nFayard v.  Tire Kingdom, Inc., No. 09-171, 2010 WL 3999011, at *1, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n108845, at *2-3 (M.D. La. Oct. 12, 2010) (internal citation omitted) (citing to Kumho Tire Co., \nLtd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999)). \nThis Court has broad discretion in deciding whether to admit expert opinion testimony. \nSee, e.g., Joiner, 522 U.S. at 138-39 (holding that appellate courts review a trial court's decision \nto  admit or exclude expert testimony under Daubert under the abuse of discretion standard); \nWatkins v. Telsmith, Inc., 121 F.3d 984, 988 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding \"[d]istrict courts enjoy wide \nlatitude in determining the admissibility of expert testimony\"); Hidden Oaks Ltd. v. City ofA  ustin, \n3 \n\n138 F.3d 1036, 1050 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"Trial courts have 'wide discretion' in deciding whether or \nnot a particular witness qualifies as an expert under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\"). \n\"Notwithstanding Daubert, the  Court remains  cognizant that  'the  rejection  of expert \ntestimony is the exception and not the rule.'\" Johnson v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., 277 F.R.D. \n161,  165  (E.D.  La.  2011)  (citing  Fed.  R.  Evid.  702  Advisory  Committee  Notes  to  2000 \nAmendments). Further, as explained in Scordill v.  Louisville Ladder Grp., L.L.C., No. 02-2565, \n2003 WL 22427981,2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19052 (E.D. La. Oct. 24, 2003) (Vance, J.): \nThe Court notes  that its  role  as  a  gatekeeper does not replace the traditional \nadversary system and the place of the jury within the system .... As the Daubert \nCourt noted, \"[v  ]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and \ncareful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means \nof attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\" . .. The Fifth Circuit has added that, \nin determining the admissibility of expert testimony, a district court must defer to \n\" 'the jury's role as the proper arbiter of disputes between conflicting opinions. As \na general rule, questions relating to the bases and sources of an expert's opinion \naffect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility and should \nbe left for the jury's consideration.\"' \n!d. at *3 (internal citations omitted) (relying on, among others, Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 61, \n107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987), and United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, More or Less \nSit. In Leflore County, Miss., 80 F.3d 1074, 1077 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting Viterbo v. Dow Chemical \nCo., 826 F.2d 420,422 (5th Cir. 1987))). \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that not all expert opinion testimony can be measured \nby the same exact standard. Rather, the Daubert analysis is a \"flexible\" one, and \"the factors \nidentified in Daubert may or may not be pertinent in assessing reliability, depending on the nature \nof the issue, the expert's particular expertise and the subject ofhis testimony.\" Kumho, 526 U.S. at \n150, cited with approval in, e.g., Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002). \nIn that vein, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that \"soft sciences,\" like psychology, involve \n\"necessarily diminished methodological precision\" when compared to other scientific disciplines \n4 \n\nlike mathematics and engineering. United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 1115, 1123 (5th Cir. 2006) \n(citing and quoting Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., 130 F.3d 1287 (8th Cir. 1997)). \nIn  such  instances,  other  indicia  of reliability  are  considered  under  Daubert, \nincluding professional experience, education, training, and observations. See e.g., \nBecause there are areas of expertise, such as the \"social sciences in which the \nresearch  theories  and  opinions  cannot  have  the  exactness  of hard  science \nmethodologies\", .. . trial judges are given broad discretion to determine \"whether \nDaubert's specific factors are, or are not, reasonable measures of reliability in a \nparticular case.\" \n!d. (internal citations omitted) (relying on Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 247 (5th Cir. \n2002); Jenson, 130 F.3d at 1297; and Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 153). \nB.  APPLICATION \nDr. Smith is Board Certified in general and forensic psychiatry. (Doc. 116-1 at 1.) \nDefendants do not challenge Dr. Smith's credentials. Rather, they attack the reliability of her \nconclusions based on first, a charge that she \"ignored\" the plaintiffs medical records and, \nsecond, that she did no testing. Defendants' contention that this witness \"ignored\" the Plaintiffs \nmedical records is belied by Dr. Smith's report, (Doc. 116-1), and her deposition, (Doc 116-2). \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff that this charge is \"plainly and factually incorrect,\" (Doc. 116 at \n2), to put it more mildly then perhaps it should be. \nDefendants' second charge is that Dr. Smith did no testing. But, as Dr. Smith explained: \n\"there is no test that you can perform to determine whether or not an incarceration in 2013 and \nanother one in 2014, as in this case, caused any irreparable-significant irreparable damage to Mr. \nGeorge's mental health.\" (Doc. 116-2 at 16-17.) As explained above, this does not automatically \ndisqualify the opinion. \"In such instances, other indicia of reliability are considered under \nDaubert, including professional experience, education, training and observations.\" Simmons, 470 \nF.3d at 1123 (citations omitted). Such is the case here. \n5 \n\nWhen one looks carefully at Defendants' allegations, it is clear that they simply disagree \nwith the conclusions of this expert, not on Daubert-worthy grounds but rather, for reasons that \nare most appropriately tested by the traditional means of cross examination and ultimately left to \nthe sound judgment of the jury. As the Daubert court itself noted, \" [v ] igorous cross-examination, \npresentation of contrary evidence and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the \ntraditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\" Daubert, 509 \nU.S. at 596. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and subject to the exceptions stated therein, this Court DENIES \nthe Defendants' Motion in Limine to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert Witness Delany M. Smith, M.D. \n(Doc. 107). \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on June 20,2016. \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n6 ",

Plaintiff also seeks a declaratory judgment, \nand injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures, executed under \ncolor of state law, that caused him, and are likely to cause him in the future, to be incarcerated in \na correctional facility in Louisiana solely because he was alleged to have violated a term of his \nconditional release.  \nPlaintiff contends that Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures, which caused him \nto be arrested and incarcerated on two separate occasions following the finding that he was \nNGRI to all criminal charges, violate his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, and subjected him to intentional discrimination in \nviolation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) and Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”).  \nII.  JURISDICTION \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 3 of 25\n2.    This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, in \nthat this is an action arising under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nthe ADA, and Section 504.   \n3.    Venue  is  appropriate  in  this  court  under  28  U.S.C.  §1391(b)(2)  since  the \nDefendants reside in this district. \nIII.  PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff TRUSSELL GEORGE, JR. is a 36-year-old man diagnosed with mental \nillness and a significant intellectual and developmental disability.  He is currently confined on an \ninpatient basis at the Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (ELMHS) in Jackson, Louisiana. \nUntil May of this year, he resided at the Stern Community Group Home located at 15626 \nConfederate Ave., Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While living in the group home he was under the \nsupervision of the Division of Probation and Parole of the Louisiana Department of Safety and \nCorrections and Community Forensic Services (CFS) of the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals, having been found NGRI to a charge of possession of a weapon by a felon. He has \nreceived treatment for mental illness since the age of 12.  Mr. George’s mental health diagnoses \ninclude Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Psychosis NOS.  \n5.  LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS is \nthe  state  agency  responsible  for  monitoring  and  providing  services  to  persons  placed  on \nconditional release or probation. The Division of Probation and Parole, which supervises Mr. \nGeorge’s conditional release, is located within the Department. The Department receives federal \nfinancial assistance and is a public entity as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) (B). \n6.  Defendant JAMES M. LEBLANC is Secretary of the Louisiana Department of \nPublic  Safety  and  Corrections.  Pursuant  to  La.  R.S.  36:403,  he  is  responsible  for  the \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 4 of 25\nadministration, control, and operation of the functions, programs, and affairs of the Department. \nHe is also responsible for, among other things, operating a probation and parole system, in \naccordance with the law.

On \ninformation  and  belief,  he  is  a  decision-maker  regarding  whether  conditionally  discharged \nindividuals whom he supervises are arrested and incarcerated. Scott Tubbs is being sued in his \nofficial and individual capacities. \n10.  Defendant KATHY KLIEBERT is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals (“DHH”).  Pursuant to La. R.S. 36:254, she is responsible for the oversight, \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 5 of 25\nsupervision and control of DHH and its divisions and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that \nDHH’s services for people with disabilities are provided in conformance with federal law. She is \nbeing sued in her official capacity only. \n11.   Defendant,  LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND  HOSPITALS \n(DHH) is a state agency, which in conjunction with the DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY \nAND CORRECTIONS, is responsible for monitoring and providing services to persons who \nhave been found NGRI and who have been either placed on conditional release or committed to a \nstate or private mental health facility. DHH operates the CFS program and ELMHS. District \nForensic Coordinators (also known as “conditional release program coordinators”) monitor Mr. \nGeorge while he is on conditional release and is responsible for providing him with appropriate \nmental health services while he is in the community. The Department receives federal financial \nassistance and is a public entity as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) (B). \n12.  Defendant ERIC BRADY is  employed as a District Forensic Coordinator by \nDHH and, as such, works under the direction and supervision of Defendant Kliebert. Mr. Brady \nhas  responsibility  for  monitoring  individuals  who  have  been  found  NGRI  and  placed  on \nconditional discharge and for and implementing the policies and procedures of DHH with respect \nto such persons.

VOSBURG, Ph.D. is a consulting psychologist with \nCFS. Dr. Vosburg has responsibility for evaluating and providing mental health services, in \naccordance with  the policies and procedures of DHH, to individuals placed on conditional \ndischarge and persons found NGRI who have been placed at ELMHS. Dr, Vosburg was a key \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 6 of 25\ndecision-maker in the arrest and incarceration of Plaintiff in 2014. Dr. Vosburg is being sued in \nhis official and individual capacities. \nIV.  STATUTORY SCHEME \n14.  La. R.S. 14:14 states that an individual charged with a criminal offense is exempt \nfrom criminal responsibility for his behavior when “the circumstances indicate that because of a \nmental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and \nwrong with reference to the conduct in question.” \n15.  La. R.S. 28:2(20) defines a mentally ill person as “any person with a psychiatric \ndisorder which has substantial adverse effects on his ability to function and who requires care \nand treatment.” \n16.  When the defendant enters a plea of not guilty and NGRI, the court may appoint a \nSanity Commission, as provided in La. Code Crim. P. art. 644, to examine the defendant to \ndetermine whether he or she was “insane” at the time of the offense. La. Code Crim. P. arts. \n650–652.  \n17.  A  finding  of  NGRI  means  that  the  defendant  has  committed  the  acts  that \nconstitute the crime; however, the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe defendant was insane at the time the acts were committed and thus cannot be held legally \nresponsible. La. Code Crim. P. art. 651. \n18.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 provides that if the defendant is found NGRI in a non-\ncapital case, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a private mental institution \napproved by the court and promptly hold a hearing to determine whether he or she can be \nreleased. When a verdict of NGRI is returned in a capital case, the code article requires the court \nto  commit the defendant to a state or private mental institution for care, custody, and treatment. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 7 of 25\n19.  Under the United States Constitution, an acquittee’s liberty may be curtailed only \nupon a finding that he is both dangerous and mentally ill.  However, implicit in the NGRI \nacquittal is a finding that the defendant is mentally ill. Therefore, at the initial contradictory \nhearing following a NGRI finding, the only issue before the court in determining whether the \nacquittee should be released or committed, is whether the acquittee is dangerous. See La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 654. \n20.  Under  Louisiana’s  statutory  scheme,  after  a  contradictory  hearing,  and \nconsidering the Sanity Commission’s findings, the court may order the individual’s release or \nmay place him on conditional release. To place the insanity acquittee on conditional release, the \ncourt must find that: \n (1)   Based on the factors which the court shall consider pursuant to \nArticle 657, he does not need inpatient hospitalization but needs outpatient \ntreatment,  supervision,  and  monitoring  to  prevent  his  condition  from \ndeteriorating to a degree that he would likely become dangerous to self \nand others. \n \n(2)   Appropriate outpatient treatment, supervision, and monitoring are \nreasonably available. \n \n(3)   There is significant reason to believe that the insanity acquittee, if \nconditionally released, would comply with the conditions specified. \n \n(4)   Conditional release will not present an undue risk of danger to \nothers or self, as defined in R.S. 28:2(3) and (4). \n \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1. \n21.  If the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to \nothers or to himself, the court shall order him committed to a proper state mental institution or to \na private mental institution approved by the court for custody, care, and treatment. La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 654. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 8 of 25\n22.  Even if a defendant has been committed under La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 as a \nresult of having been found dangerous and presumed mentally ill based on the finding of NGRI, \nthe acquittee may later apply for discharge or conditional release. La. Code Crim. P. art. 655. \n23.  The insanity acquittee or the superintendent of the facility in which he is being \nheld may petition a review panel  for discharge. The review panel is comprised of comprised of \nthe  person's  treating  physician,  the  clinical  director  of  the  facility  to  which  the  person  is \ncommitted,  and  a  physician  or  psychologist  who  served  on  the  sanity  commission  which \nrecommended commitment of the person. If the review panel determines that the acquittee is not \na danger to himself or others, it can recommend to the court that he be discharged conditionally \nor unconditionally or placed on probation. La. Code Crim. P. art. 655(A). \n24.  Upon this recommendation or upon an acquittee’s petition, the court may hold a \ncontradictory  hearing,  La.  Code  Crim.  P.  art.  655(A),  and  order  that  the  acquittee  be \nconditionally released for a “fixed or an indeterminate period.” La. Code Crim. P. art. 657. \n  25.   In ordering a conditional release, the court “shall subject a conditionally released \ninsanity acquittee to such orders and conditions it deems will best meet the acquittee's need for \ntreatment, supervision, and monitoring and will best serve the interests of justice and society.” \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1(B). \n  26.  Typically, the conditional release orders impose restrictions and requirements, \nsuch as compliance with treatment, signing release of information forms, or refraining from the \nuse of alcohol, that do not in and of themselves constitute criminal conduct, even if violated. \n27.  When ordered, a conditional release must extend at least one year but not more \nthan five, although it can be extended after five years in one-year increments for good cause \nshown at a yearly contradictory hearing. La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.2. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 9 of 25\n28.  The insanity acquittee on conditional release is supervised by the Division of \nProbation and Parole of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections.  \n29.  In  addition,  District  Forensic  Coordinators  of  CFS  are  responsible  for  the \ncommunity treatment and monitoring of individuals placed in the community on conditional \nrelease after being found NGRI.  See La. Code Crim. P. 658(B). \n30.  Pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(1), if the division of probation and \nparole alleges that the acquittee violated or is about to violate a condition of his conditional \nrelease, he may be arrested and detained in a correctional facility under the provisions of La. \nCode Crim. P. art. 899, which applies to those who have been convicted of a crime and placed on \nprobation. \n31.  The court must be notified of violations and receive a recommendation from the \nconditional  release  program  coordinator  as  to  whether  the  conditional  discharge  should  be \nrevoked or the insanity acquittee recommitted. La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(5). \n32.  Pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(6), a court, on its own motion or that of \nthe district attorney or probation officer, can order the acquittee arrested and incarcerated in \norder to determine whether the acquittee violated a term of his conditional discharge.  \n33.  Upon receiving a report and recommendation from a review panel pursuant to La. \nCode Crim. P. art. 658(B)(5), the court must “immediately” hold a hearing or transfer the case to \nthe parish of commitment, if different from the parish of arrest, at which place the hearing should \nbe held “as soon as possible.”  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(B)(6). \n34.  If the court determines that there has been a violation of a term of the conditional \nrelease or that the acquittee was about to violate the conditions of release, it may do any of the \nfollowing: \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 10 of 25\n(a)   Reprimand and warn the probationer; \n \n(b)   Order that supervision be intensified; \n \n(c)   Modify or add additional conditions to the probation; \n \n(d)   Revoke  the  probation  and  recommit  the  probationer  to  a  state \nmental institution, subject to consideration for discharge or release on \nprobation only after one year has elapsed from the date of revocation and \nin accordance with the procedure prescribed in Articles 655 through 657 \nfor a first application and hearing.  \n \nLa. Code Crim. P. art. 658(C). \n \n35.  If an acquittee violates the terms of conditional release, there are options under \nLouisiana law other than arrest and incarceration. If a person on conditional release or otherwise \non probation under the aforementioned code provisions is in need of acute, i.e. short-term, \nhospitalization and is not charged with a new criminal offense, he may be voluntarily admitted \npursuant to La. R.S. 28:52 or admitted by emergency certificate pursuant to La. R.S. 28:53 to the \nELMHS or to another suitable treatment facility, with subsequent notice to the court. La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 658(B)(4). \n36.  If the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to \nhimself or others, the court shall order him committed to a proper state mental institution or to a \nprivate mental institution approved by the court for custody, care, and treatment. La. Code Crim. \nP. art. 654. \n37.  Even if a defendant has been committed under La. Code Crim. P. art. 654, as a \nresult of having been found dangerous and presumed mentally ill based on the finding of NGRI, \nthe acquittee may later apply for discharge or conditional release. La. Code Crim. P. art. 654(B). \n38.  In addition, the superintendent of the facility in which the acquittee is being held \nmay petition the review panel for discharge, which can recommend to the court that the person \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 11 of 25\nbe discharged conditionally or unconditionally or placed on conditional release, after finding that \nthe acquittee is not a danger to himself or others or is no longer mentally ill.  \n39.  The court can completely discharge an acquittee from conditional release “after \nthe expiration of one year in a supervised conditional release program only on recommendation \nof the director of the division of probation and parole or the administrator of the conditional \nrelease  program  or  on  other  proper  evidence  of  expected  outpatient  compliance  with  any \ncontinued  treatment  recommendations,  and  after  a  contradictory  hearing  with  the  district \nattorney.” La. Code Crim. P. art. 658(D). The court may also grant an application for discharge \nwith no probation period. La. Code Crim. P. art. 654. \nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n40.  In 1997 and 1999, respectively, Mr. George was allowed to plead guilty, despite \nhis  mental  illness and significant  cognitive disabilities, to  charges of criminal  trespass and \npossession of a schedule II substance.  \n            41.       In 2008, based upon his prior convictions of criminal trespass and possession of a \nschedule II substance, Mr. George was charged with possession of a firearm by a felon.  \n42.  Following his arraignment, the court initially referred Mr. George’s case to a \nSanity Commission to determine whether he was competent to stand trial.  \n43.   The Sanity Commission found that Mr. George was not competent to stand trial. \n44.  The recommendation of the Sanity Commission was not adopted by the court. \nInstead, his case was again referred to the Sanity Commission, this time to determine whether he \nwas NGRI. \n45.  The Sanity Commission recommended that Mr. George was NGRI.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 12 of 25\n46.  On December 15, 2008, following a finding that Mr. George was NGRI to a \ncharge of possession of a firearm by a felon, the court ordered that he be conditionally released \npursuant to La. C. Crim. P. art. 657.1, for a period of five years, provided he receive adequate \noutpatient treatment, supervision, and monitoring. \n47.   In ordering Mr. George’s conditional release, the court established, among other \nthings, the following conditions: \na)   That he reside at Progressive Group Home, 1334 Frances Harriet \nDrive, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  \n \nb)   That  he  attend  the  local  mental  health  clinic  in  Baton  Rouge, \nLouisiana, and follow the treatment recommendations prescribed by his \ntreating  physician,  as  well  as  comply  and  cooperate  with  sessions  of \ncounseling and/or treatment, oral and/or injectable medications as ordered \nby the attending physician.  \n \nc)   That he report to the local probation office within twenty-four (24) \nhours of release from jail, excluding non-business days. \n \nd)   That he be subject to the outpatient tracking/monitoring services to \nbe  provided  by  the  Community  Forensic  Services  Program  of  the \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals. \n \ne)   That  he  sign  all  consent  for  release  of  information  forms  and \nagencies involved in the medical/psychiatric care of the defendant shall \nreport on a regular basis to the District Forensic Coordinator or State \nProbation Officer, who were authorized to have access to progress notes, \nattendance  sheets,  medication  order  sheets,  and  pertinent  medical, \npsychiatric, psychological, and neurological consultations. \n \nf)   That he refrain from the consumption of alcohol and all illicit \ndrugs and from frequenting places where alcohol/illicit drug sales and \nconsumption occur. \n \ng)   That  the  Aftercare  Provider  notify  the  District  Forensic \nCoordinator and/or State Probation Officer of any positive drug screens or \nproblems related to treatment and/or behavior problems. \n \n48.  Although the location of the group home has changed since 2008, Mr. George \ncontinuously resided in a group home setting as required by his conditional release order until \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 13 of 25\nMay of 2014, except for a period of approximately one month, described below, when he was \nincarcerated.  \n49.  The group homes Mr. George resided in are operated by Progressive Health Care \nProviders (PHP) and are Intermediate Care Facilities for People with Developmental Disabilities \n(“ICF-DD”). ICF-DD is one of a number of residential services options operated under the \nauspices  of  DHH.  See  La.  R.S.  28:451.1  et  seq.    As  is  typical  of  many  group  homes, \napproximately five other individuals, all of whom have a developmental disability and many of \nwhom have mental illnesses, resided in the PHP facilities with Mr. George. The daily operations \nof these group homes are handled by paid staff. All group home residents must be in active \ntreatment. \n50.  During the five  years that Mr. George resided in  the PHP  Group Home, he \nreceived an array of mental health services, including a day activities program and a Behavioral \nSupport  Plan  to  address  behaviors  that  are  a  manifestation  of  his  disability.  Mr.  George’s \nmedication regimen has consisted of Risperdal injections every two weeks, Klonopin, Depakote, \nTrazodone, and Cogentin.  \n51.  According to his Behavioral Support Plan, due to his mental illness, Mr. George \non some occasions engaged in verbal aggression and non-compliance within the group home and \nthe day program  he  attended during the week.  His Behavioral  Support  Plan noted that on \noccasion, he may engage in outbursts and “threatening” episodes when his medication is not \ncorrect. \n52.  The behaviors that Mr. George manifests are typical of behaviors exhibited by \nmany other men with mental illness and developmental disabilities residing in the close quarters \nof a group home. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 14 of 25\n            53.      Six months prior to the end of his conditional discharge term, Mr. George was \nhospitalized and deprived of his needed medication regimen.  \n54.  As a consequence of not having his medication, Mr. George allegedly engaged in \nverbal outbursts and threatening behavior, which included yelling at a staff member that he “had \nbetter get me a hamburger” and telling another resident at the group home that he was going to \nkill him. These statements were reported to Scott Tubbs, the Probation and Parole Officer, who \nmonitors Mr. George’s conditional discharge.  \n  55.   At the request of Mr. Tubbs, employees of Mr. George’s day program drove Mr. \nGeorge to the Probation Officer’s office, where he was arrested.   \n56.  At the time of Mr. George’s arrest in July 2013, Mr. Tubbs knew, or should have \nknown, of Mr. George’s disabilities and his need for appropriate mental health treatment. \n57.  Mr. George was consequently incarcerated from July 29, 2013 to August 23, 2013 \nat the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on the basis of the alleged violation of his conditional \ndischarge. He was released only after the undersigned counsel filed a petition for habeas corpus \non his behalf in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish. \n            58.      No criminal charges were ever filed against Mr. George for any behavior that \noccurred on or before July 29, 2013 that pertained to his incarceration in the East Baton Rouge \nPrison between July 29, 2013 and August 23, 2013. \n  59.  After his release from East Baton Rouge  Parish Prison in August 2013, Mr. \nGeorge returned to live in his PHP group home. \n60.  In December 2013, prior to the expiration of Mr. George’s five-year conditional \nrelease period, DHH’s forensic coordinator, Defendant Eric Brady, requested that Mr. George’s \nconditional release be extended an additional year.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 15 of 25\n61.  On May 14, 2014, after several continuances, the court granted the Department’s \nrequest and extended Mr. George’s conditional release to December 14, 2014. \n62.  Within a week after the May 14, 2014 hearing, Defendant Brady arranged for Mr. \nGeorge to be involuntarily hospitalized at the ELMHS.  \n63.   Upon information and belief, DHH did not afford Mr. George the procedural \nprotections set forth in La. R. S. 28:53-56 while he was confined at ELMHS. Mr. George did not \nagree to a voluntary admission and Defendant Brady did not secure an emergency certificate \npursuant to R.S. 28:53.  \n64.  Even  if  the  legal  basis  for  Mr.  George’s  commitment  at  ELMHS  was  an \nemergency certificate, by July 1, 2014 such a certificate had long expired.1  \n65.  DHH did not apply for a judicial commitment under La. R. S. 28:54. Instead, Mr. \nGeorge remained in ELMHS without written notice of allegations on which his commitment was \nbased, or an opportunity for a hearing, until July 1, 2014.  \n66.  On July 1, 2014, while still hospitalized at ELMHS, Defendants Eric Brady, Mr. \nGeorge’s Forensic Coordinator, and Dr. Charles P. Vosburg, a psychologist with CFS, consulted \nand decided that Mr. George’s “probation” should be revoked and that his probation officer \nshould remove him from ELMHS and cause him to be incarcerated in the East Baton Rouge \nParish Prison.  \n                                                 \n1   La. Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 658(B)(4) provides: “If a person on conditional release or \notherwise probated under this Chapter is in need of acute, i.e. short-term, hospitalization and is not \ncharged with a new criminal offense, he may be voluntarily admitted pursuant to R.S. 28:52 or admitted \nby emergency certificate pursuant to R.S. 28:53 to the Feliciana Forensic Facility or to another suitable \ntreatment facility, with subsequent notice to the court.” Under La. R.S. 28:53(A)(1), a person can only be \ndetained 15 days pursuant to an emergency certificate.  In order to detain an individual in a treatment \nfacility past the 15 days, 28:53(H) requires that a petition for judicial commitment under La.R.S. 28:54 be \nfiled. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 16 of 25\n67.  As  a  consequence,  on  July  1,  2014,  Mr.  George  was  again  arrested  and \nincarcerated in East Baton Rouge Prison by a representative of the Division of Probation and \nParole for violating the terms of his conditional discharge.  \n68.  At the time they caused him to be arrested and incarcerated, Defendants Eric \nBrady and Charles P. Vosburg knew, or should have known, of Mr. George’s disabilities and his \nneed for appropriate mental health treatment. \n69.  Again, Mr. George was forced to apply to the Nineteenth Judicial District Court \nin East Baton Rouge for relief.   \n70.  On August 22, 2014, the district court, acting on Plaintiff’s Motion for Release, \nordered  him  released  from  the  East  Baton  Rouge  Parish  Prison  and  temporarily  placed  at \nELMHS.  \n71.  Despite the district court’s order that Plaintiff be immediately released, Plaintiff \nwas not released from the East Baton Parish Rouge Prison and placed at ELMHS until August \n25, 2014. \n72.      No criminal charges were ever filed against Mr. George for any behavior that \noccurred on or before July 1, 2014 that pertain to his incarceration in the East Baton Rouge \nParish Prison between July 1, 2014 and August 25, 2014. \n            73.     While incarcerated in 2013 and 2014, Mr. George was deprived of appropriate \nmental health treatment and, as a result, became very nervous and paranoid.  \n74.  While incarcerated in 2013 and 2014, Mr. George was not provided with an \nopportunity to post bail, to have an attorney appointed for him, or to be read his rights. At no \ntime during his incarceration was Mr. George notified of the charges against him or how long he \nwould be held. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 17 of 25\n            75.     While incarcerated in 2013 and 2014, Mr. George was isolated and placed in \nlockdown for “mental reasons,” which meant that he only had 15 minutes to leave his cell to take \na shower, had no exercise time, and was restricted in his use of the canteen and in his ability to \nreceive reading material. \n  76.  At a hearing on September 23, 2014, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in East \nBaton Rouge, Judge Richard Moore presiding, ordered that Mr. George remain at ELMHS and \nthat his placement be reviewed at a hearing scheduled for December 11, 2014.  \n77.  The Defendants, Department of Public Safety and Corrections and Department of \nHealth and Hospitals, as a matter of policy, practice, and procedure, arrest and incarcerate, or \nsecure the arrest and incarceration, of individuals placed on conditional release following a \nNGRI determination for the sole reason that they are alleged to have violated a condition of their \nrelease. \n78.  Due to Defendants’ policies and practices, Mr. George is at substantial risk of \nfuture incarceration for breaching conditions of his release and his status as a person who has \nbeen found NGRI and compelled to receive mental health services from Defendants. \n79.    The  primary  purpose  for  incarcerating  individuals  in  Louisiana  correctional \nfacilities is punishment. Such facilities do not have the capacity to provide the mental health \ntreatment to individuals found NGRI. \n80.  Only  persons  with  mental  illness  in  Louisiana  are  intentionally  subjected  to \npunishment by incarceration in correctional facilities in the absence of pending criminal charges \nor a conviction of a criminal offense. \n81.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, acted under color of state law. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 18 of 25\n82.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, have acted and continue to act \nwith deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s liberty interests.  \n83.  Defendants intentionally discriminate against persons found NGRI on the basis of \ntheir mental illness by confining them, or causing them to be confined, in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities where they are subjected to punishment and unable to access appropriate mental health \nservices. \n84.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this complaint, knowingly and intentionally \nviolated Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights. \n85.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been deprived of \nhis  liberty by incarceration  in  a Louisiana correctional  facility and has suffered significant \nirreparable damage to his mental health.   \n86.   As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and \nprocedures, Plaintiff, who is still on conditional release, is in significant jeopardy of again being \nsubjected to irreparable harm by being incarcerated in a correctional facility and deprived of his \nmental health treatment and services. \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n  A.  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS  \n87.    Under the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution, only individuals \nwho have been properly charged with or convicted of a crime may be punished by incarceration \nin prison or jail. Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 369 (1983).    \n88.  “[D]ue process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson v. Indiana, \n406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 19 of 25\n89.     For insanity acquittees, the purpose of commitment is to provide treatment of \ntheir mental illness in a manner that is not punitive, and to protect society from dangerous \nbehavior that may result from that mental illness.  \n90.  For insanity acquittees, when either dangerousness or mental illness ceases to \nexist, the State has no legitimate interest in commitment.  \n91.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which cause persons  who have \nbeen  found  NGRI  and  are  able  to  be  released  on  specified  conditions  without  danger  to \nthemselves or others to be confined in correctional facilities for the sole reason that they are \nalleged to have violated a condition of their release, violate those persons’ rights under the Due \nProcess Clause to the United States Constitution. \n92.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 658 (B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899 are unconstitutional \non their face to the extent that they authorize state officials to arrest and incarcerate Plaintiff and \nother persons found NGRI merely because they are alleged to have violated a condition of their \nrelease. \n93.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth in this complaint, which caused Plaintiff to be \nconfined in a correctional facility for the sole reason that he is alleged to have violated a \ncondition of his release, violate his rights under the Due Process Clause to the United States \nConstitution. \n94.   In the absence of injunctive and declaratory relief, Defendants’ policies, practices \nand procedures, as described in this Complaint, are likely in the future to violate Plaintiff’s rights \nunder the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution.  \n   \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 20 of 25\nB.  VIOLATIONS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n95.  As a qualified person with disabilities, Plaintiff is entitled to the protections and \nbenefits of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which provides that \"no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded from participation \nin or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \nsubjected to discrimination by such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n96.  Regulations implementing the ADA prohibit a public entity from providing any \naid, benefit, or service, directly or through contractual licensing, or other arrangements that (i) \nDeny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the \naid, benefit, or service;  (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;  \n(iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as \neffective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to \nreach the same level of achievement as that provided to others; and (iv) Provide different or \nseparate aids, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals \nwith disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified \nindividuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided \nto others. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i-iv). \n97.  Defendants’  policies,  practices  and  procedures,  which  cause  individuals  with \nmental illness who have been found NGRI to be confined in state correctional facilities following \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility solely because they are alleged to have violated a \ncondition of their discharge, deny persons with mental illness who have been found NGRI the \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 21 of 25\nopportunity to effectively participate in or benefit from mental health services and subject them \nto punishment on the basis of their disability in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n98.  The ADA's implementing regulations further provide that \"a public entity may \nnot, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of \nadministration: (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability….” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n99.  Defendants’ criteria and methods of administration, which single out for arrest \nand incarceration persons with mental illness who have been found NGRI solely because it is \nalleged  that  those  persons  violated  a  condition  of  their  discharge,  subject  such  persons  to \ndiscrimination on the basis of their disability and violate Title II of the ADA.  \n100.    Defendants’ criteria and methods of administration found in La. Code \nCrim. P. art. 658 (B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899, on their face, violate the ADA and are \ncontrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution in that they authorize state \nofficials  to  arrest  and  incarcerate  persons  with  mental  illness  found  NGRI  and  placed  on \nconditional release for the sole reason that they are alleged to have violated a condition of their \nrelease. \n101.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth in this complaint, which caused Plaintiff to be \nconfined in a correctional facility for the sole reason that he is alleged to have violated a \ncondition of his release, discriminate against Plaintiff on the basis of his disability and violate \nTitle II of the ADA.  \n102.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which have caused, and in the \nabsence of injunctive relief are likely to cause, persons with mental illness, such as Plaintiff, to \nbe confined in a correctional facility for the sole reason that he allegedly violated a condition of \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 22 of 25\nhis conditional release, discriminate against Plaintiff on the basis of his disability and violate \nTitle II of the ADA. \nC.  VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n  103.  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  states  that  \"[n]o  otherwise  qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving federal financial assistance . . ..\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n104.  Section 504's regulations also prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \n\"utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration ... (i) [t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified \nhandicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap ….\" 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4); 28 \nC.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(I). \n105.  Defendants’ criteria and methods of administration, which single out for arrest \nand incarceration persons with mental illness who have been found NGRI solely because it is \nalleged  that  they  have  violated  a  condition  of  their  discharge,  subject  such  persons  to \ndiscrimination on the basis of their disability and violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   \n106.  Defendants’  policies,  practices  and  procedures,  which  cause  individuals  with \nmental illness who have been found NGRI to be confined in state correctional facilities following \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility solely because they are alleged to have violated a \ncondition of their discharge, denies them the opportunity to effectively participate in or benefit \nfrom mental health services and subjects them to punishment on the basis of their disability in \nviolation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n107.  Defendants’ criteria and methods of administration found in La. Code Crim. P. \nart. 658 (B) and La. Code Crim. P. art. 899, on their face, violate the Section 504 of the \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 23 of 25\nRehabilitation Act and are contrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution in \nthat they authorize state officials to arrest and incarcerate persons with mental illness found \nNGRI and placed on conditional release for the sole reason that they are alleged to have violated \na condition of their release. \n108.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth in this complaint, which caused Plaintiff to be \nconfined in a correctional facility for the sole reason that he is alleged to have violated a \ncondition of his release, discriminate against Plaintiff on the basis of his disability and violate \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n109.  Defendants’ policies, practices and procedures, which have caused, and in the \nabsence of injunctive relief are likely to cause, persons with mental illness, such as Plaintiff, to \nbe confined in a correctional facility for the sole reason that he allegedly violated a condition of \nhis conditional release, discriminate against Plaintiff solely on the basis of his disability  and \nviolate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nVII.  PRAYERS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against the Defendants as follows: \nA.  Award Plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be shown at \ntrial. \nB.  Issue  an  order  granting  Plaintiff  permanent  injunctive  relief  prohibiting \nDefendants from arresting and incarcerating individuals in correctional facilities who have been \nplaced on conditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to \nhave violated a condition of their discharge; \n  C.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures \nof arresting and incarcerating individuals in state correctional facilities who have been placed on \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00338-JWD-RLB   Document 42    12/23/14   Page 24 of 25\nconditional discharge following a finding of NGRI, solely because they are alleged to have \nviolated a condition of their discharge, violate Plaintiff’s rights under the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; \nD.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \nTRUSSELL GEORGE, JR. \nCIVIL ACTION \nVERSUS  No. 3:14-00338-JWD-EWD \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF \nPUBLIC SAFETY AND \nCORRECTIONS, ET AL \nORDER AND RULING ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nBefore the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendants' MSJ\"), (Doc. 74), \nfiled by nine legal persons- the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections \n(\"DPSC\"); Mr. James LeBlanc (\"LeBlanc\"), in his capacity as Secretary for DPSC; Mr. Whalen \nGibbs (\"Gibbs\"), Assistant Secretary for DPSC; Mr. Gerald Starks (\"Starks\"), Director of the \nDPSC's Division of Probation and Parole (\"Probation and Parole\"); Mr. Scott Tubbs (\"Tubbs\"), \nan agent with Probation and Parole; Ms. Kathy Kliebert (\"Kliebert\"), in her capacity as Secretary \nfor the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (\"DHH\"); 1 DHH; Mr. Eric Brady \n(\"Brady\"), a District Forensic Coordinator (\"DFC\") for DHH; and Dr. Charles P. Vosburg \n(\"Vosburg\"), a consulting psychologist for DHH (collectively, \"Defendants\"}-and the \nPlaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiffs MSJ\"), (Doc. 76), filed by Mr. \nTrussell George, Jr. (\"George\" or \"Plaintiff') by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Ms. \nLetitica Walker (\"Walker\"). Defendants' MSJ is supported by a separately docketed \n1 Officially, Kliebert has since been replaced as head ofDHH by Ms. Rebekah M. Gee (\"Gee\"). \nNo motion has been filed to formally substitute Kliebert with Gee, though Defendants have made \nthe switch in their latest filings. (See Doc. 98 at 1.) \n1 of30 \n\nmemorandum (\"Defendants' Memorandum\"), (Doc. 81); Plaintiffhas done the same with his \nown memo (\"Plaintiff's Memorandum\"), (Doc. 82). Defendants have countered Plaintiff's MSJ \nwith Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment (\"Defendants' Opposition\"), (Doc. 89), and Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's \nStatement of Undisputed Facts (\"Defendants' Response\"), (Doc. 94). To these two motions, \nPlaintiff has replied with the Plaintiff's Reply to Defendants' Opposition to Summary Judgment \n(\"Plaintiff's Reply\"). (Doc. 96.) Plaintiffhas addressed Defendants' MSJ with the Plaintiff's \nOpposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiff's Opposition\"), (Doc. 91), \nto which Defendants have replied with the Reply Brief in Support of Defendants' Motion for \nSummary Judgment (\"Defendants; Reply\"), (Doc. 98). \nIn this suit, the reach of one federal constitutional provision-the Due Process Clause of \nthe United States Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment- and two related federal statutes- the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), as later amended, and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 19732-are at issue. In his dispositive filing, Plaintiff has asked this Court \nto declare that two related state laws- Articles 658 and 899 ofthe Louisiana Code of Criminal \nProcedure3-pursuant to which he was incarcerated are unconstitutional as applied to persons \nsimilarly situated. In their motion, Defendants maintain no reasonable doubt can be raised about \nthe applicability of their every defense to and the legal weakness of Plaintiff's three discrete \nclaims. In essence, Defendants ask for a dispositive ruling as to every fact-specific defense \nasserted in their multiple filings, and Plaintiff demands that a state law and a state practice, \n2 In this ruling and order, any and all references to \"Section 504\" or\"§ 504\" are to this particular \ndivision ofthis federal statute. \n3 In this ruling and order, any and all references to \"Article\" or \"Articles\" are to these particular \nsubdivisions ofLouisiana's Code of Criminal Procedure. \n2 of30 \n\nsimilar to many, be deemed unconstitutional. For the Defendants and Plaintiff(collectively, \n\"Parties\"), the law and the facts appear crystal clear. \nHaving weighed the Parties' arguments, this Court disagrees. As the Parties' lengthy \nfilings suggest, a highly fact-specific analysis is required for every one of Defendants' asserted \nshields. Moreover, no uncontested principle of law firmly establishes or clearly forbids liability \nbased on this case's particular facts. For purposes ofFe deral Rule of Civil Procedure 56,4 this \nCourt must determine whether material issues of fact are in dispute; when it does so in this case, \ntoo many questions remain unanswered for any one of Defendants' defenses to be adjudicated at \nthis juncture. As courts have observed, the reasonableness of a certain course of conduct and the \ninadequacy of a proposed accommodation, so pivotal to one party's case and another's defense, \nrequire determinations for which a jury is empaneled and which only it can definitively answer. \nMeanwhile, akin in language and structure to other state laws and a federal statute \ndeclared constitutional by a multitude of courts, Articles 658 and 899 cannot be found to be \nfacially unconstitutional. It is possible that Plaintiff was subjected to an unconstitutional \napplication of these articles. However, on their face, their constitutionality cannot be questioned \nbased on precedent's overwhelming weight. For these reasons, as more fully explained below, \nthe Plaintiffs MSJ and the Defendants' MSJ (collectively, \"Dispositive Motions\") must fail.5 \n4 In this ruling and order, any reference to \"Rule\" or \"Rules\" is to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure unless otherwise noted. \n5 Technically, by denying Plaintiffs MSJ, this Court does accept Defendants' contention that \nArticles 658 and 699 are facially constitutional. To wit, this ruling can be construed as \neffectively granting in part Defendants' MSJ. \n3 of30 \n\nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nA.  RELEVANT FACTS \nDiagnosed with \"schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Psychosis NOS, and significant \nintellectual and development disability,\" (Doc. 42 at 3, 11), Plaintiff was found Not Guilty by \nReason of Insanity (\"NGRI\") to a charge of possession of a weapon by a felon. (Doc. 103 ,-r 1 at \n4; Doc. 103-2 ,-r 1 at 1; Doc. 76-21 at 2; Doc. 42 at 11.) Treated for these disabilities since the age \nof twelve, he had previously been convicted of criminal trespass and possession of a schedule II \nsubstance. (Doc. 1 at 9; Doc. 42 at 11.) Upon his conviction, as required by law, on December \n15, 2008, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, placed him on \nconditional release for a period of five years. (Doc. 103 ,-r 2 at 4; Doc. 103-2 ,-r 3 at 1-2; Doc. 74-\n3 at 1; Doc. 76-21 at 2-3; Doc. 42 at 12.) The conditions totaled eight: (1) residence at \nProgressive Group Home (\"PGH\") in Baton Rouge; (2) attendance at a mental health clinic in \nBaton Rouge and compliance with treatment recommendations; (3) reporting to the local \nprobation office within twenty-four hours of release from jail; (4) subjection to monitoring \nservices provided by DHH's Community Forensic Services Program (\"CFS\"); (5) consent for \nrelease of information from medical providers to agencies to report on a regular basis to the \nDistrict Forensic Coordinator or State Probation Officer; (6) refraining from consumption of \nalcohol or illicit drugs and from frequenting places where consumption commonly occurs; (7) \nthat providers notify the District Forensic Coordinator (\"DFC\") and/or State Probation Officer of \nany positive drug screens; and (8) refrain from possession of any weapons. (Doc. 103-2 ,-r 4 at 2; \nDoc. 74-3 at 1-2; Doc. 42 at 12.) Commonly authorized for persons adjudicated NGRI, these \nconditions were not unusually harsh or particularly unique. (See, e.g., Doc. 103 ,-r 7 at 5; Doc. \n103-2 ,-r 13 at 4.) \n4 of30 \n\nFollowing the verdict ofNGRI, Plaintiff was placed under the supervision of Probation \nand Parole and CFS. (Doc. 103 ~ 5 at 4; Doc. 103-2 ~ 10 at 3-4; Doc. 76-21 at 3; Doc. 1 at 9.) \nFrom December 2008 to May 2014, with certain notable exceptions at the heart of this case, \nPlaintiff resided in PGH. (Doc. 103 ~ 4 at 4, 103-2 ~ 6 at 3.) These supervising agencies \ncontacted and worked with supervisees. (Doc. 103 ~ 7 at 5; Doc. 103-2 ~ 13 at 4.) Tubbs was \nassigned as Plaintiffs probation officer and monitored his conditional release. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 18 \nat 5; Doc. 74-3 at 2; Doc. 76-21 at 3.) Brady is one ofDHH's DFCs and had been assigned to \nassist Plaintiff and Tubbs. (Doc. 103 ~ 14 at 6; Doc. 103-2 ~ 24 at 6.) Vosburg is a consultant to \nCFS, (Doc. 103 ~ 16 at 6; Doc. 103-2 ~ 29 at 7), and was responsible for providing mental health \nservices of DHH to individuals on conditional release and at the Eastern Louisiana Mental \nHealth System (\"ELMHS\") in Jackson, Louisiana, and to provide recommendations as to \nplacement and treatment, (Doc. 103-2 ~ 30 at 7), Starks served as the Director of Probation and \nParole; Gibbs served as his immediate superior. (Doc. 42 at 3-4.) As such, by virtue of this \nstate's statutory scheme, see, e.g., LA. CODE CRJM. PROC. art. 658, and Plaintiffs multiple \nincarcerations and inpatient treatment at various facilities, (Doc. 42 at 13- 16), every Defendant \nwas involved, whether directly (i.e. Tubbs, Brady, and Vosburg) or indirectly (i.e. LeBlanc, \nKliebert/Gee, and Gibbs), with Plaintiffs case beginning on December 15, 2008. (See, e.g., Doc. \n42 at 3---6.) \nOn June 10,2013, Tubbs allegedly prepared a letter to the state district court about \nPlaintiffs verbally aggressive behavior with staff at PGH and requested the court set a review \ndate to address expiration of the conditional release. (Doc. 74-3 at 3.) For an unknown reason, no \ncourt date was ever set. (!d.) In time, though he was still at PGH, Plaintiffs misbehavior \n5 of30 \n\nescalated.6  (!d.; see also, e.g., Doc. 42 at 13- 14.) About six months prior to the end of his \nconditional discharge term, George was hospitalized and deprived of his needed medication. \n(Doc. 1 at 11; Doc. 42 at 13.) As a consequence of this deprivation, in July of2013, Plaintiff \napparently had an unusually extreme series of outbursts, each of which was reported to Tubbs. \n(Doc. 103-2 ~ 33 at 7-8; Doc. 76-21 at 3; Doc. 1 at 11.) Aware ofthese \"verbal outbursts and \nthreatening behavior,\" (Doc. 1 at 11 ), Tubbs and Brady arrested Plaintiff and confined him in \nEast Baton Rouge Parish Prison (\"EBRP\") on July 29, 2013. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 35 at 8; Doc. 74-3 at \n2; Doc. 76-21 at 3-4.) \nThe Parties' descriptions of subsequent events diverge. Plaintiff alleges that he was not \ncharged with any crime during or after this incarceration and that Tubbs failed to request a court \nhearing for two weeks following incarceration. (Doc. 103-2 ~~ 41-44 at 12; Doc. 1 at 11.) \nConversely, Defendant maintains that Tubbs notified the district court by telephone on the day of \nthe arrest and, on August 12, 2013, wrote a letter to the state district court outlining Plaintiff's \nbehavior, and filed a Detainer Notification, Affidavit of Probable Cause, and a Motion for \nHearing to Revoke Probation. (Doc. 74-3 at 2-3.) \nOn August 23,2013, Plaintiff was released. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 45 at 12; Doc. 74-3 at 3; Doc. \n76-21 at 4.) Between August and December 2013, he once more lived in PGH. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 45 \nat 12; Doc. 74-3 at 3; Doc. 76-21 at 4.) In December of2013, Brady requested the conditional \nrelease period be extended by a year. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 46 at 12; Doc. 74-3 at 3; Doc. 42 at 14.) In \nMay 2014, the state court granted the request and extended the conditional release to December \n6 Notably, per the Behavioral Support Plan produced by PGH, Plaintiff is prone to verbal \naggregation and disobedience, \"on occasion .. . engag[ing] outbursts and 'threatening' episodes \nwhen his medication is not correct.\" (Doc. 1 at 11.) According to Plaintiff, his behaviors \"are \ntypical of behaviors exhibited by many other men with mental illness and developmental \ndisabilities residing in the close quarters of a group home.\" (!d.) \n6 of30 \n\n14, 2015. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 47 at 12; Doc. 74-3 at 3; Doc. 42 at 15.) Within a week, Brady allegedly \narranged for the Plaintiff to be involuntarily hospitalized at ELMHS with no secure emergency \ncertificate and no judicially ordered commitment. (Doc. 103-2 ~~ 48-51 at 13; Doc. 76-21 at 4; \nDoc. 42 at 15.) \nOn July 1, 2014, while Plaintiff was at ELMHS, Brady, Vosburg, and Kelly decided \nconditional release should be revoked and Plaintiff should be incarcerated for refusing to accept \ntransfer to a different unit ofELMHS. (Doc. 103-2 ~~52-56 at 13-14; Doc. 74-3 at 3-4; Doc. \n76-21 at 4; Doc. 42 at 15.) Plaintiff contends that he reacted negatively to this news, acting angry \nand agitated and unleashing a slew ofverbal threats. (Doc. 103-2 ~~57-58 at 14-15; Doc. 76-21 \nat 4.) Even so, Plaintiff emphasizes that he did not strike or attempt to strike anyone, (Doc. 103-2 \n~~57-58 at 14-15; Doc. 76-21 at 4), and had otherwise been compliant during his time at \nELMHS, (Doc. 103-2 ~~ 59-60 at 15; Doc. 76-21 at 4). Naturally, Defendants tell a slightly \ndifferent tale: in July of2014, Kelly contacted Tubbs to transport Plaintiff because he was \nconcerned that Plaintiff might harm staff or other patients and that Plaintiff indicated he wanted \nto go to jail. (Doc. 74-3 at 4.) Regardless of the underlying reason, on August 25, 2014, Plaintiff \nwas released from EBRP and returned to ELMHS, having never been charged with any crime. \n(Doc. 103-2 ~~ 64-65 at 16; Doc. 76-21 at 5.) \nPlaintiffs treatment during these multiple incarcerations is not itself disputed although \nthe adequacy of that treatment certainly is. Plaintiff alleges that during both incarcerations he did \nnot receive appropriate mental health treatment, resulting in the aggravation of his underlying \ndisorder. (Doc. 103-2 ~ 66 at 16; Doc. 76-21 at 5.) As an inmate, he was wholly isolated and \nafforded no exercise time, restricted use of canteen, and limited reading materials. (Doc. 103-2 ~ \n67 at 16; Doc. 76-21 at 5; Doc. 1 at 12.) Throughout his time in jail, Plaintiff claims that he was \n7 of30 \n\nnot properly medicated, resulting in growing nervousness and paranoia. (Doc. 1 at 12; Doc. 42 at \n16 -17.) Stated differently, Plaintiff essentially contends that, during his incarceration, no penal \ninstitution treated him for his qualified disability in spite of a record attesting to his manifold \ndisorders. (See, e.g., Doc. 42 at 13-16.) \nOn August 14, 2014, the state court ordered Plaintiff released from EBRP. (Doc. 42 at \n16.) His release, however, did not take place until August 25, 2014. (!d.) Through December 23, \n2014, Plaintiff was again confined on an inpatient basis at ELMHS in Jackson, Louisiana. (!d. at \n3.) Until May of2014, he resided at the Stem Community Group Home located at 15626 \nConfederate Ave., Baton Rouge, Louisiana. (!d.) In the group home, he was under the \nsupervision ofLDPSC's Probation and Parole and DHH's CFS. (!d.) \nB.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiff filed his first pleading on May 28, 2014, (Doc. 1), an amended complaint on \nSeptember 24, 2014, (Doc. 24), and the second amended complaint (\"Complaint\") on December \n23,2014, (Doc. 42). Defendants' MSJ and Plaintiffs MSJ were tendered on February 1, 2016. \n(Doc. 74, 76.) The supporting memoranda were filed on February 2, 2016. (Docs. 81-82.) On \nFebruary 24, 2016, Defendants docketed their opposition, (Doc. 91); on February 29, 2016, they \nfiled their reply to the Plaintiffs statement of undisputed facts, (Doc. 94). Plaintiffs Reply came \non March 7, 2016. (Doc. 96.) On March 8, 2016, Defendants submitted their reply. (Doc. 98.) On \nJune 6, 2016, for the reasons stated in this ruling, this Court denied the Plaintiffs MSJ and \nDefendants' MSJ. (Doc. 112.) \n8 of30 \n\nC.  PARTIES' ARGUMENTS \n1.  Defendants' MSJ \nBroadly, Defendants argue that summary judgment is appropriate in the present matter \nfor the following reasons: (1) Defendants are entitled to immunity under the Eleventh \nAmendment pursuant to 28 United States Code, Section 1983/ (2) Defendants are entitled to \nqualified immunity; (3) Plaintiff's arrest was constitutional and in compliance with the relevant \narticles ofthe Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure; (4) such articles are facially valid and \nconstitutional; (5) Plaintiffs arrest was based on reasonable cause, the sole statutory \nrequirement; (6) Plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages; and (7) Plaintiff has failed to prove \nany violation ofthe ADA and RA. (Doc. 74 at 1-2.) \na.  Eleventh Amendment \nDefendants assert that the Eleventh Amendment provides immunity for states and state \nofficials from suit brought their own citizens. (Doc. 74-3 at 7 (quoting Tennessee v. Lane, 541 \nU.S. 509, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004)).) Defendants argue that neither states nor \ntheir officials are considered to be \"persons\" under § 1983 and therefore remain entitled to the \nimmunity provided by the Eleventh Amendment. (Doc. 74-3 at 7 (quoting Will v. Michigan \nDep't ofState Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989)).) The one \nrecognizable exception- Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123,28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), \n(Doc. 74-3 at 7)- allows for \"suits against state officials for the purpose of enjoining the \nenforcement of an unconstitutional state statute.\" (!d. at 8 (quoting Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d \n405, 411 (5th Cir. 2001)).) \n7 In this ruling and order, any and all references to \"Section 1983\" or\"§ 1983\" are to this \nparticular federal statute. \n9 of30 \n\nYet, because ofthe nature of Plaintiffs constitutional claim- he is seeking to enjoin the \nenforcement of Articles 658(B) and 899, which allow state officials to arrest and incarcerate \nindividuals on the grounds that they have violated a condition of their conditional discharge, (Id . \nat 8-9)-Defendants assert that this lone exception does not apply here for two reasons. First, \nDefendants argue that only Tubbs, as a probation or peace officer, is authorized to make such \narrest and Plaintiff has provided no support to show that the others ever exercised such power. \n(Jd.  at 8.) In contrast, Gee, Brady, and Vosburg have no ability to arrest and enjoining them from \ndoing so would be meaningless. (Jd. at 9.) Second, LeBlanc, Gibbs, and Stark are purely \nsupervisory officials. (Jd.  at 10.) Not only does \"vicarious liability ... not apply to§ 1983 \nclaims\" but such officials may only be held liable if \"they affirmatively participate in acts that \ncause constitutional deprivations\" and \"implement unconstitutional policies that causally result \nin plaintiffs injuries.\" (!d. (quoting Mouille v. City ofL ive Oak, Tex., 977 F.2D 924, 929 (5th \nCir. 1992)).) \nBy Defendants' reckoning, not one of these defendants falls into this exception for \nsupervisory officials. LeBlanc is responsible for the operation of the system of probation and \nparoles, but he is not authorized to make arrests. (Jd. at 10.) Gibbs is the Assistant Secretary, who \ndirects the operations of the same system. (Jd.) Starks, as Director of Probation and Parole, \nassisted in the administration, development, and implementation ofthis agency's policies. (/d.) It \nis argued that, as to each of these defendants, Plaintiff has failed to show how they were \npersonally involved in George's arrests, an action beyond their rightful powers. (Jd.) For that \nvery reason, again, injunctive relief against them would be meaningless. (!d. at 10 ). \n10 of30 \n\nb.  Qualified Immunity \nAs Defendants rightly note, state officials sued in their individual capacity and for \nmonetary relief may assert the doctrine of qualified immunity as a defense. (!d. at 11.) A state \nofficial may enjoy qualified immunity so long as his or her conduct does not violate \"clearly \nestablished constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" (!d. at 11.) \nThis immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the \nlaw.\" (!d. at 11 (quotingAshcroftv. al-Kidd, 563 U.S 731, 131 S. Ct. 2074,2085, 179 L. Ed. 2d \n1149 (20 11) ). ) To determine whether the actions of a state official are protected by qualified \nimmunity, the court is to consider \"( 1) whether the claims the Plaintiff alleges constitute a \nconstitutional right and (2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the incident.\" \n(!d. at 12) (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 \n(2009)).) \nTo Defendants, their apparent compliance with state law defeats application of either \nprong. Article 658 (B) allows for an individual to be placed on conditional release subject to the \nsupervision of Probation and Parole. (!d.) The article further allows the person to be arrested in \ncompliance with Article 899. (!d. at 13.) By steadfastly adhering to these articles, Defendants \nfollowed governing state law and had no reason to suspect a federal constitutional right was \nbeing infringed. (!d.) Put differently, in following statutes whose constitutional validity should \nbe presumed, Defendants could not possibly have run afoul of \"a clearly established \nconstitutional right\" or acted without this doctrine's requisite objective reasonableness. (Jd.) \n11 of30 \n\nc.  Facial Constitutionality ofA  rticles 658 and 899 \nIn order for a statute to be unconstitutional on its face, there must be no set of \ncircumstances in which the statute would be valid. (!d. at 16.) As Defendants explain, Article \n899 sets forth the process by which any probationer may be arrested or detained as the result of a \nviolation of his or her probation. (!d. at 17.) Here, Plaintiff has asserted that Article 899 is \nunconstitutional as applied to individuals found NGRI and conditionally released. (!d.) By \ndefinition, therefore, other instances exist in which the article could be constitutionally applied, \nand Plaintiffs facial challenge must necessarily fail. (/d.) Further, Defendants contend that the \nPlaintiff fails to take into account circumstances in which a crime has been committed and/or \nfear for public safety would warrant an individual's arrest under Articles 899 and 658B. (!d.) In \nthis case, as Defendants once more emphasize, Plaintiff was arrested because he was presumed \nto be a risk to the broader public, a ground which saves these articles' constitutionality and \ndefeats any possible facial argument. (!d. at 18.) \nd.  Punitive Damages \nIn order to get punitive damages under§ 1983, the Plaintiff must demonstrate that the \nDefendants' conduct was \"motivated by evil motive or intent [or that] it involves reckless or \ncallous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" (!d.  at 19 (citing Smith v. Wade, \n461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S. Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1983)).) For Defendants, no such \nreckless or callous indifference can here be shown, for Plaintiffs arrest was pursuant to Articles \n658(B) and 899, presumptively constitutional enactments, and was triggered by Plaintiffs \nviolations of court-imposed conditions. (!d.) When the danger presented by Plaintiff was so \nobvious and clear, their actions- to confine him in a prison without minimally necessary medical \n12 of30 \n\ncare- and the official policy behind them, cannot be described as indicative of a reckless or \ncallous indifference to Plaintiffs due process rights. \ne.  Applicability ofR  A and ADA \nRightly arguing that the ADA and § 504 encode the same legal standard, Defendants \nadmit that the Plaintiff qualifies as disabled for purposes of both these statutes. (ld) Nonetheless, \nthey deny that Plaintiff was excluded, denied benefits, or discriminated against by reason of his \ndisability. (Id) In so averring, Defendants assume that Plaintiffs argument is that his \nincarceration caused a denial of benefits. (Id at 20.) In making this argument, Defendants stress \nthat there is no authority to support the idea that dependence on services, benefits, and activities \ncould warrant immunity from incarceration, as Plaintiffs argument necessarily implies. (ld.) \n2.  Plaintiff's MSJ \nIn a motion more focused than Defendants', Plaintiff asserts that there are no genuine \nissues of material fact as to two discrete issues. So convinced, Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n(1) grant his motion; (2) enjoin the Defendants from arresting him because of a violation of his \nconditional release; (3) declare unconstitutional the Defendants' policies, practices, and \nprocedures for arresting individuals on conditional release for violating a condition thereof; (4) \ndeclare Articles 658(B) and 899 facially unconstitutional under the Due Process and Supremacy \nClauses of the United States Constitution; and (5) award Plaintiff such other relief as may be \nappropriate. (See, e.g., Doc. 76-21 at 1.) \n13 of30 \n\na.  Constitutional Violations \nThe Fourteenth Amendment protects liberty interests that arise from the Due Process \nClause itself or the laws of the United States. (ld. at 6 (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, \n103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983)).) An individual has a liberty interest in being free from \nincarceration absent a criminal conviction. (ld. at 6 (citing Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 \nS. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1976)).) Plaintiff first contends that, as an individual found not \nguilty by reason of insanity, he is exempt from criminal conviction and therefore cannot be \nsubject to incarceration. (ld.) Any long-term or intermediate commitment based on the \nindividual's incompetence to stand trial, he argues, violates the Constitution. (ld.) \nDescribing Article 658 as a civil commitment statute, Plaintiff alleges that the sole purpose of the \nPlaintiff's incarceration, which spanned several months, was because ofthe lack of beds at \nELMHS. (ld. at 7.) However, \"due process requires that the nature and duration of the \ncommitment bear some reasonable relationship to the purpose for which individual is \ncommitted.\" (ld.) Although civil commitment is permissible when the individual is a risk to the \npublic, the lack of capacity asserted here cannot be a justification for his incarceration. (Id .) \nNext, as Plaintiff had a right to adequate medical treatment, his incarceration violated the \nDue Process Clause because ofthe lack of mental health treatment available in the prison (ld.) \nLastly, Plaintiff maintains that \"commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation \nof liberty that requires Due Process Protection,\" and such commitment will always violate the \nConstitution when no essential \"rehabilitative\" treatment is present or available. (Id . at 9.) Thus, \nindividuals confined due to mental illness are constitutionally entitled to more than the basic \nnecessities provided to the general prison population. (Id . at 12.) Even so, Plaintiff never \nreceived adequate treatment while incarcerated in the EBRP (ld. at 14.) He was not provided \n14of30 \n\nwith a treatment plan, therapy, or consistent administration of his medication, and he was placed \nin clinically destructive lock down. (!d) Crucially, Defendants have seemingly admitted \nawareness of the prison's limited mental health services, services normally provided by a proper \nmental health institution. (Id at 15- 16.) Clearly, Plaintiff argues, as a matter of law, a state's \nlack of resources cannot justify depriving an individual ofthese liberty interests. (Id at 13). Yet, \nas the uncontested facts allegedly show, such deprivation happened here. (Id) \nb.  Applicability of RA and ADA \nThe ADA was enacted to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. \n(Id at 16.) Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally conducted \nprograms and all other operations of public entities that receive federal assistance. (Id at 17.) \nSubstantively similar, these related laws are linked by the ADA's Title II, which extends the \nprotections set forth in Section 504 to all state and local government entities. (Id.) Plaintiff \nargues that by incarcerating individuals on conditional release for violating a condition of that \nrelease, the Defendants discriminated against those with mental illness by (1) denying those \nindividuals the benefit of conditional discharge programs and services and (2) providing them \nwith unequal and separate opportunities to participate in programs and activities, different than \nnon-disabled individuals and others adjudicated NGRI, some of whom receive treatment at state \nor private mental health institutions. (Id at 19.) So as to comply with these federal commands, \nDefendants should have reasonably modified their policies to allow Plaintiff to receive adequate \nmental health treatment. (Id at 23 (citing Rouse v. Plantier, 997 F. Supp. 575, 582 (D. N.J. \n1997) ). ) Instead, Defendants ( 1) used incarceration as a routine technique for managing \ndifficulties concerning those with disabilities, (2) treated Plaintiffs mental illness as a criminal \n15 of30 \n\njustice matter, (3) denied Plaintiff placement in a mental health institution or group home and \nfailed to take his mental illness into account, and (4) made it impossible for him to obtain the \nsame benefits as provided by programs in such institutions. (ld at 24-25.) \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  LEGALSTANDARD \n1.  Rule 56 \nPer Rule 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\" FED. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Wilson v.  Tregre, 787 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Rule \n56( a)). A dispute is \"genuine\" so long as \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return \na verdict for the nonmoving party\"; a fact is \"material\" if it \"might affect the outcome of the suit \nunder the governing law.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, \n2510, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Ray v. United Parcel Serv., 587 F. App'x 182, 186 (5th \nCir. 2014). Axiomatically, a court construes all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to \nthe nonmovant. Haverda v. Hays Cnty., 723 F.3d 586, 591 (5th Cir. 2013). In response to \nanother's motion, the nonmovant cannot rely on \"[c]onclusory allegations, speculation, \nunsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic arguments.\" TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James of Wash., \n276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir. 2002). \nStill, \"[w]hen both parties have submitted evidence of contradictory facts,\" Boudreaux v. \nSwift Transp. Co., Inc., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005), a court is bound to \"draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor ofthe nonmoving party,\" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumping Prods., \n530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097,2110, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. \n16 of30 \n\nat 248 (emphasizing the irrelevance of\"[a]ny proof or evidentiary requirements imposed by the \nsubstantive law,\" materiality \"not a criterion for evaluating the evidentiary underpinning of \n[factual disputes]\"). It thus cannot \"make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" \nReeves, 530 U.S. at 150. This command- that a district court \"eschew making credibility \ndetermination or weighing the evidence,\" Calhoun v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 1259, 1261 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) (citing Lathram v. Snow, 336 F.3d 1085, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2003)); accord, e.g., Flythe v. \nDist. of Columbia, 791 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2015)- applies so long as the record contains \npatches of reasonable ambiguity that have not been artificially manufactured. See, e.g., Tolan v. \nCotton, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2014) (per curium) (\"[C]ourts may not resolve \ngenuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment.\"). \nUnder Rule 56, this Court must \"give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant \nas well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at \nleast to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.\" 9A WRIGHT, supra, § \n2529. To wit, although this Court \"should review the record as a whole, it must disregard all \nevidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.\" Reeves, 530 U.S. \nat 151, cited in Havera, 723 F.3d at 591. Within the narrow domain of Rule 56, summary \njudgment is hence inappropriate (1) ifthere are legitimate, not superficial or frivolous, factual \ndisputes that may affect the outcome of the case under the applicable substantive law, see \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248, and (2) so long as the nonmovant does not exclusively rely on \"some \nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts,\" \"conclusory allegations,\" \"unsubstantiated \nassertions,\" or \"a scintilla of evidence,\" Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. \n1994). Questions of statutory construction are particularly well-suited for resolution by summary \njudgment. See, e.g., Asher v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Inc. (In re Asher), 488 B.R. 58, 64 \n17 of30 \n\n(Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2013); Heublein, Inc. v. United States, 996 F.2d 1455, 1461 (2d Cir. 1993) \n(citing Oklahoma ex rei. Dep't ofH  uman Servs. v.  Weinberger, 741 F.2d 290, 291 (lOth Cir. \n1983)); Stissi v. Interstate & Ocean Transport Co., 765 F.2d 370, 374 (2d Cir. 1985); FEDERAL \nJUDICIAL CENTER, THE ANALYSIS AND DECISION OF SUMMARY JUDGEMENT MOTIONS 15 (1991 ). \n2.  Articles 658 and 899 \nAt the center of this case is Article 658 which creates the system of conditional release, \ndefined as \"[w]hen .. . [a] committed person is released on probation.\"  LA. CODE CRIM. PROC. \nart. 658A; see also LA. R.S. § 28:58-59; Harper v. State, 2014-0110 (La. App. 4 Cir. 09/09/15); \n176 So. 3d 479, 511 n.8. Pursuant to its first paragraph, \"[i]t shall be a condition of every such \nprobation that the person released shall be recommitted if he becomes dangerous to others or to \nhimself for reasons of mental illness, substance abuse, or intellectual disability,\" and \"[t]he \nprobationer\" must \"be required to agree in writing to the conditions of his probation.\" LA. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. art. 658A. Any probationer is placed \"under the supervision of the division of \nprobation and parole.\" !d. art. 658B(l). If\"the probationer violates or is about to violate the \nconditions of his probation, he may be arrested and detained in conformity with the applicable \nprovisions of Article 899.\" !d. Notably, Probation and Parole must \"immediately notify court of \nany substantive violations or imminent violations of the conditions of a person's probated release \nand shall present recommendations to the court regarding whether the court should revoke the \nprobation and recommit the probationer to a state mental institution or other recommendations as \nmay be appropriate.\" !d. art. 658B(5).Thereafter, the court may order the relevant person's arrest \nbut must \"immediately hold a hearing to consider the violations listed or transfer the case to the \nparish of commitment, if different from that of the arrest, at which place the hearing should be \n18 of30 \n\nheld as soon as possible.\" !d. art. 658B(6). No arrest is permitted once an insanity acquitee has \nbeen completely discharged pursuant to Article 658D. State ex rei. Reeves v. State, 00-1798 (La. \n09/14/00); 768 So. 2d 595, 595. \nIncorporated into Article 658, Article 899 sets forth the rules for arrest for a violation of \nconditional probation. LA. CODE CRJM. PROC. art. 899. In general, \"[a]t any time during \nprobation and suspension of sentence the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant \nfor violation of any ofthe conditions of probation, or may issue a summons to appear to answer \nto a charge of violation or threatened violation.\" !d. art. 899 A. \"The warrant of arrest may be \nexecuted by any peace officer [or probation officer] and shall direct that the defendant be \nreturned to the custody of the court or to a designated detention facility\"; it must \"be personally \nserved upon the defendant.\" !d. arts. 899A, 899F. But, \"[i]f a probation officer has reasonable \ncause to believe that a defendant has violated or is about to violate a condition of his probation or \nthat an emergency exists so that awaiting an order of the court would create an undue risk to the \npublic or to the probationer, the probation officer may arrest the defendant without a warrant, or \nmay authorize a peace officer to do so.\" !d. art. 899B. Regardless of whether Article 899A or \n899B has been invoked, \"[w   ]ithin ten days following the arrest of an offender pursuant to the \nprovisions of this Article, the court shall determine if there is probable cause to detain him \npending a final violation hearing and shall consider whether to allow the offender bail pending \nthe final hearing.\" !d. art. 899E. \"The determination of probable cause may be made without a \nformal hearing and may be conducted through the use of affidavits.\" !d. Even if probable cause is \nfound, a final violation hearing must still be promptly held. !d. \n19 of30 \n\n3.  ADAandRA \nUnder well-established precedent, prisoners may bring claims against their jailors for \ndisability discrimination under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. 8 Pa. Dep 't of \nCorrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206,209- 10, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 1954-55, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 \n(1998); see also, e.g., Frame v. City ofA rlington, 657 F.3d 215, 224-25 (5th Cir. 2011). Title II \nprohibits discrimination by \"public entities,\" 42 U.S.C. § 12131 (1 ), and state punitive institutions \nfall squarely within this statutory definition, Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210. Typically, a plaintiff \nproceeding under Title II must \"show that: (1) he or she is a 'qualified individual with a \ndisability'; (2) he or she is being excluded from participation in, or being denied the benefits of \nsome service, program, or activity by reason of his or her disability; and (3) the entity which \nprovides the service, program or activity is a public entity.\" Douglas v. Gusman, 567 F. Supp. 2d \n877, 889 (E.D. La. 2008). \nBeyond these general guiding principles, precedent establishes two other cardinal rules. \nFirst, while the ADA's reasonable accommodation requirement does not apply under Title II, its \n\"reasonable modifications\" requirement-\"A public entity shall make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \n8 Section 504 of the RA protects qualified individuals from discrimination on the basis of \ndisability by entities receiving financial assistance from any federal department or agency. 29 \nU.S.C. § 794 et seq. Passed in 1973, the ADA expanded upon its protections. Naturally, \ntherefore, the same prima facie case be made by a disabled plaintiff under both acts, Zukle v. \nRegents ofUniv. ofCal., 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 (9th Cir. 1999), and courts readily \"examine cases \nconstruing claims under the ADA, as well as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because there \nis no significant difference in the analysis of rights and obligations created by the two Acts,\" \nVinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1152 n.7 (9th Cir. 2002). As such, the two law's substantive \napplicability is not affected by the possibility that DPSC receives no federal money. \n20 of30 \n\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity,\" 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(7); 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 682, 121 \nS. Ct. 1879, 1893, 149 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2001)- has been held to apply in the prison context. \nGarrett v. Thaler, 560 F. App'x 375, 382 (5th Cir. 2014). Consequently, while the ADA \"does \nnot require prisons to provide new services or programs for disabled prisoners,\" these same \nentities \"do have an affirmative obligation to make reasonable modifications . . .  so that a \ndisabled prisoner can have meaningful access to existing public services or programs.\" Borum v. \nSwisher Cnty., No. 2:14-CV-127-J, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8628, at *21, 2015 WL 327508, at *9 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2015) (emphasis added). Second, the Fifth Circuit has held that a defendant's \nfailure to make the reasonable modifications necessary to adjust for the unique needs of disabled \npersons can constitute intentional discrimination under the ADA. See, e.g., Melton v. Dall. Area \nRapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 672 (5th Cir. 2004); Garrett v. Thaler, 560 F. App'x 375, 382 (5th \nCir. 2014). A different kind of intent, in other words, governs in ADA cases. See Garrett, 560 F. \nApp'x at 385. \n4.  Qualified Immunity \nQualified immunity is available when a § 1983 suit is brought against a state official in \nhis individual capacity, making him or her personally liable for any damages awarded to a \nplaintiff. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \"In deciding whether a state official is entitled to qualified immunity, \nit must first be determined whether a plaintiff successfully alleged facts showing the violation of \na constitutional right by state officials.\" Cohn v. New Paltz Cent. Sch. Dist., 363 F. Supp. 2d 421, \n431 (N.D.N.Y. 2005). \"If a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties' \nsubmissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\" \n21 of30 \n\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001).9 For the right to \nbe so classified, its \"contours ... must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would \nunderstand that what he [or she] is doing violates that right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. \n635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034,97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987). \"[I]f ... [a] defendant's conduct was \nobjectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the violation,\" however, \neven a right's status as firmly established will not foreclose qualified immunity's invocation. \nDorsett-Felicelli v. Cnty. of Clinton, 371 F. Supp. 2d 183, 193 (N.D.N.Y. 2005). Perhaps \nunsurprisingly, this inquiry regarding whether a defendant's actions were objectively reasonable, \nwhich is commenced only upon proof of a right's positive existence, has been described as \"a \nfact-intensive inquiry\" ill-suited for ultimate resolution via Rule 56. !d.; see also, e.g., Sales v. \nBarizone, No. 03 Civ. 6691RJH, 2004 WL 2781752, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2004). \nB.  APPLICATION \n1.  Plaintiff's MSJ \nBound by the foregoing law, this Court must deny Plaintiffs request for summary \njudgment for two reasons. \nFirst, Articles 658 and 899 cannot be deemed to be constitutionally infirm as a matter of \nundisputed constitutional law. Undeniably, as Plaintiff now asserts, (Doc. 42 at 19), \n\"commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires Due \nProcess Protection.\" Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354,361, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 3048, 77 L. Ed. \n2d 694 (1983); see also Welsch v. Likins, 373 F. Supp. 487,499 (D. Minn. 1974). As such, \n9 Despite the language in Saucier, this two-part analysis need not proceed sequentially, and the order may be readily \nreversed depending on the case's peculiar circumstances. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, \n818, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009); L.A. Cnty. V. Rette/e, 550, U.S. 609,616, 127 S. Ct. 1898, 1994, 167 L. Ed. 2d 974, \n(2007) (per curium). \n22 of30 \n\n\"indefinite commitment of a criminal defendant solely on account of his incompetency to stand \ntrial\" cannot be \"square[ d) with the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process.\" Jackson \nv. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 731,92 S. Ct. 1845, 1855,32 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1972). However, under \nthe Constitution, \"it is always true of probationers (as we have said it to be true of parolees) that \nthey do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... conditional \nliberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions.\" Griffin v. \nWisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 874, 107 S. Ct. 3164,3169,97 L. Ed 709 (1987) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (relying on Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L. \nEd. 2d 484 (1972)). To pass constitutional muster, the conditions of supervised release or \nconditional probation \"must be reasonably related to the history and characteristics of the \ndefendant and must impose no greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary to deter \ncriminal conduct and protect the public.\" United States v. Knight, 86 F. App'x 2, 4 (5th Cir. \n2003). Indeed, rehabilitation is not the sole goal; the public's protection is an equally weighty \nand occasionally overriding one. See, e.g., United States v. Bartels, 962 F.2d 558, 560 (6th Cir. \n1992); accord United States v. Balderas, 358 F. App'x 575, 579 (5th Cir. 2009). In addition, \nwhile the termination of such person's liberty \"calls for some orderly process, however \ninformal,\" only \"some informal procedural guarantees\" are required. Morissey, 408 U.S. at 482. \nIn particular, the Due Process Clause is satisfied when a preliminary hearing takes place near the \ntime of the parolee's arrest and detention so as \"to determine whether there is probable cause or \nreasonable ground to believe that the arrested parolee has committed acts that would constitute a \nviolation of parole conditions.\" Henderson v. Simms, 223 F.3d 267, 274 (4th Cir. 2000). \nAcknowledging this jurisprudence, court after court has refused to declare as \nunconstitutional statutes that authorize the arrest of a person found NGRI upon his or her \n23 of30 \n\nviolations of the conditions of his or her release, assuming any such recommission is ultimately \nreviewable by a court oflaw. See, e.g., Archuleta v. Hedrick, 365 F.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 2004); \nPhelps v. United States, 831 F .2d 897, 898 (9th Cir. 1987). Indeed, the constitutionality of a \nfederal statute so allowing has been repeatedly upheld, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 4243(g), 4246; \nCochran v. Dysart, 965 F.2d 649, 649 (8th Cir. 1992), as have been several states' own \nconditional probation strictures, see, e.g., Grass v. Reitz, 643 F.3d 579 (8th Cir. 2011). Pursuant \nto this extensive jurisprudence, as any arrest under Articles 658 and 899 is subject to judicial \nreview, see supra Part II.A.2, neither provision can be deemed facially unconstitutional. LA. \nCODE CRIM. PRoc. arts. 658, 899E. Like their federal equivalent, these articles systemize a \nprogram for conditional release and contain both a \"statutory procedure\" and \"a substantive \nstandard\" that, in the words of another circuit, \"are clearly constitutional.\" Archuleta, 365 F.3d at \n648; cf Taylor v. San Diego Cnty., 800 F.3d 1164, 1170 (9th Cir. 2015) (affirming the \nconstitutionality of a conditional release statute, the Sexually Violent Predator Act, for it did \"not \ncreate a capricious custody scheme in violation of equal protection tenets\"). \nSecond, several questions of material fact render it impossible to conclude that \nDefendants unquestionably and necessarily violated the ADA. Generally, \"[t]he ADA prohibits \ndiscrimination because of disability, not inadequate treatment for disability.\" Simmons v. Navajo \nCnty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 2010). Thusly interpreted by sundry courts, the ADA \nis not violated by a prison failing to attend to the medical needs of its disabled prisoners. Grzan \nv. Charter Hosp. ofNw. Ind., 104 F.3d 116, 121, 123 (7th Cir. 1997) (as to Section 504); Bryant \nv. Madigan, 84 F.3d 246,249 (7th Cir. 1996) (as to the ADA); see also, e.g., Kiman v. NH \nDep 't ofCorr., 451 F.3d 274, 284 (1st Cir. 2006). Furthermore, under the ADA, a demand for \n\"reasonable accommodations to assure access to an existing program\" is cognizable, but a \n24 of30 \n\ndemand for \"additional or different substantive benefits\" is not. Wright v. Giuliani, 230 F.3d 543, \n548 (2d Cir. 2000). Finally, whether a covered entity has failed to interact in good faith and thus \nfailed to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual is considered an ineradicably factual \nquery, one that can often preclude summary judgment. See Lowe v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 363 \nF. App'x 548, 552 (lOth Cir. 2010) (as to an employer). \nUnfortunately for the success of Plaintiffs MSJ, these principles may yet exempt them \nfrom liability in this proceeding. As the apparent facts alone suggest, Defendants' failure to \nprovide Plaintiff with adequate mental health care related not to his disability but the state's \nlimited resources and his seeming danger to the broader public. (Doc. 103-2 ,-r 35 at 8; Doc. 74-3 \nat 2; Doc. 76-21 at 3-4.) In fact, even Plaintiff concedes his behavior was \"threatening\" and his \n\"outbursts\" frequent. (See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 11.) As such, for a certain reasonable factfinder, \nPlaintiffs confinement could still be viewed as based not on an intentional disregard for his \ndisability but on an increasingly violent pattern of conduct for which the state's existing facilities \nat the time of his outbursts were insufficient or unavailable. If a jury so believes, no \ndiscrimination under the ADA could be proved, Plaintiffs non-accommodation the product of \nsomething besides the ADA's forbidden motive. Cf Emmett v. Kwik Lok Corp., 528 F. App'x \n257, 261 (3d Cir. 2013) (\"[T]he factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus \nmotivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.\"). \nSimilarly, it is presently impossible to conclude that Defendants treated Plaintiff any \ndifferently than others determined to be NGRI and who pose a seeming danger to the public and \nlack the means to obtain private treatment. (See Doc. 94 at 4.) Had such incontrovertible \nevidence been presented, liability may have been inescapable, for Defendants' failure to \naccommodate a deeply sick man would have been predicated purely on their intent to \n25 of30 \n\ndiscriminate against this state's disabled. For now, however, other reasons, including purported \nconcerns for the public's safety, may explain Defendants' actions. Thus, no such liability can be \nfound as a matter of unquestionable law and fact. Accordingly, genuine issues of fact and law \npersist, and summary judgment cannot issue. \nB.  Defendants' MSJ \nWith one ostensible exception,10 Defendants' multipronged MSJ contains similar \nevidentiary issues. \nFirst, Defendants read the doctrine of sovereign immunity too broadly. True, Section \n1983 did not obviate the states' sovereign immunity, as guaranteed by the Eleventh \nAmendment.11 However, as permitted by precedent, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 152; accord \nGuillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-Gomez, 585 F.3d 508, 530 n.24 (1st Cir. 2009), Plaintiff is \nsuing certain Defendants in their official capacities for injunctive relief as to his constitutional \nclaims, (See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 13; Doc. 42 at 19; Doc. 74-3 at 8-9). Other defendants, from Tubbs \nto Vosburg, were directly and personally involved in his confinement; as a matter of law, they \ncan be sued in their individual capacities. See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21,29-30, 112 S. Ct. \n358, 363, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1991); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 1687, \n40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974), overruled on other grounds, Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 104 S. Ct. \n3012, 82 L. Ed. 2d 139 (1984). \n10 By denying the Plaintiff's MSJ, see supra Part liLA, this Court has, in effect, endorsed \nDefendants' argument about the facial constitutionality of Articles 658 and 899. Whether these \nlaws, as applied, violate the Plaintiffs constitutional rights is a separate issue. \n11 No such bar applies to the Plaintiff's ADA claims. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, \n159, 126 S. Ct. 877, 881, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006). This Court notes that this confusion may \nhave been the result of Plaintiffs drafting. (See Doc. 42 at 2.) \n26 of30 \n\nMoreover, as the Complaint intimates, Plaintiff has advanced a theory of liability \npredicated on Monell v. Dep 't ofS ocial Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 \n(1978), a long-recognized exception to various state actor's otherwise broad immunity from suit. \nSee, e.g , Owens v. Bait. City State's Attys. Office, 767 F.3d 379,402-03 (4th Cir. 2014); see \nalso, e.g , Bd. ofCnty. Comm 'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L. Ed. \n2d 626 (1997). He has alleged- and Articles 658 and 899 readily bear this out- that Defendants, \nindividually and collectively, followed a policy in which disabled persons subject to conditional \nrelease were incarcerated without regard for their proven medical needs, (See, e.g , Doc. 1 at 1-\n4; Doc. 42 at 17- 18.) Assuming this allegation can be proven, the Eleventh Amendment would \npose no hurdle to this suit's success. \nSecond, Defendants' qualified immunity cannot, as of yet, be firmly established. \nUnquestionably, this doctrine shields defendants from liability if a constitutional right is not \nclearly established and their actions are objectively reasonable. See supra Part II.A.4. Yet, for \ntwo reasons, Defendants have sought to invoke it too early. First, if the constitutional right is \nclear and it has been violated, no immunity rightly attaches, see, e.g , Beers-Capitol v.  Whetzel, \n256 F .3d 120, 142 n.15 (3d Cir. 2001 ), and invocation of state law will not absolve any official \nof blame for such unconstitutional misconduct, cf Hollihan v. Pa. Dep 't of Corr., No. 3: 15-CV-\n5, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6318, at *21, 2016 WL 235003, at *8 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 20, 2016). Here, \nas precedent declares, \"commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of \nliberty that requires due process protection,\" and \"[t]he Due Process Clause requires that the \nnature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the \nindividual is committed.\" Jones, 463 U.S. at 368. Because violation of this very right girds \n27 of30 \n\nPlaintiffs constitutional arguments, qualified immunity cannot be rightfully claimed at the \nsummary judgment stage. \nSecond, establishing whether a defendant's actions were objectively reasonable is \nuniformly described as \"a fact-intensive inquiry.\" Sales, 2004 WL 2781752, at * 16. As a \nconsequence, courts have therefore been unsurprisingly reluctant to find qualified immunity \napplicable on summary judgment. See, e.g., Dorsett-Felicelli, 371 F. Supp. 2d at 193Y So far, \nhaving assembled much credible evidence, Plaintiff has alleged that Tubbs, Sparks, and others \nfully knew (or should have known) ofthe medical consequences ofhis disability and that \nLeBlanc, Gee, and Gibbs knowingly enforced a system dedicated to imprisonment rather than \ntreatment, thereby ignoring the body of law spawned by Jones. If this reasonably colorable \ncontention is later believed and Defendants' protestations to the contrary are disbelieved, a jury \nmay yet find none of Defendants' actions to be objectively reasonable. As long as that reasonable \npossibility remains, no Defendant may enjoy the privilege of qualified immunity at the summary \njudgment stage . . \nThird, Defendants predicate their motion upon an unduly narrow reading of the ADA. To \n\"win\" his disability case at this stage, Plaintiff needed to show no more than that a reasonable \njury could conclude that his sundry disorders rendered him disabled, that his disability \nsubstantially impaired his ability to perform a wide class of positions, and that Defendants failed \nto provide him with a reasonable accommodation. Chambers ex ref. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of \n12 For this same reason, this Court denies Defendants' request that Plaintiffs claim for punitive \ndamages be dismissed. Quite simply, the evidence presented could allow a reasonable jury to \nfind that Defendants' conduct and/or policy was animated by a callous and reckless indifference \nto the due process rights of a person adjudicated NGRI. According to Plaintiff, he was denied \nmental health care with no legal or factual justification and never afforded the kind of care and \naccommodation to which the law entitles him. It remains reasonably possible that a jury could \nfind this approach to a deeply troubled man for whom Defendants were obliged to provide care, \nresulted from the kind of callousness that punitive damages are intended to punish. \n28 of30 \n\nPhi/a. Bd. ofE  duc., 587 F.3d 176, 189 (3d Cir. 2009). So long as the factual evidence so far \nassembled can support these allegations, Rule 56 compels the denial of the Defendants' MSJ as \nto Plaintiffs ADA claim. \nHere, two facts, attested to by the existing record, show why such denial must follow. \nFirst, Plaintiffs mental state left him unable to live successfully without consistent treatment and \nmedical supervision. Crucially, this need for a particular medical regimen appears in documents \nproduced and accessed by CFS, DHH, Tubbs, and others; indeed, the state court itself made \nextensive and expansive medical treatment an explicit term of Plaintiffs conditional release. See \nsupra Part II.A. Whether ignored in favor of a more punitive policy or pure happenstance, ample \nevidence of Plaintiffs perilous condition and his certain needs lay, ready and clear, in multiple \nfiles of the Defendants. \nSecond, despite this fact, Tubbs and Starks sent Plaintiff to prisons in which he did not \nreceive this essential treatment and did so pursuant to a state statute. Regardless of these persons' \nprecise reason, and despite DHH's responsibility over these matters, LA. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. \n658B(2), Plaintiff was deposited in a prison in which such services were unavailable. Even if \noverwhelmed, other facilities that do provide such services arguably existed. See supra Part II.A. \nCertainly, even if such other entities could not accommodate Plaintiff, the ADA would still have \nbeen violated by such deliberate actions, for it requires \"reasonable accommodations to assure \naccess to an existing programs.\" Wright, 230 F.3d at 548 (emphasis added). \nOne more arguable violation merits emphasis. Pursuant to the ADA, \"[a] public entity \nshall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications \nare necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can \ndemonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, \n29 of30 \n\nprogram, or activity,\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); PGA Tour, Inc., \n532 U.S. at 682. Material issues of fact exist as to whether such reasonable and necessary \nmodifications were available and should have been made. In sum, if a reasonable jury found \nPlaintiffs allegations to be true, Defendants may rightly be found liable under the ADA. \nDefendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue must therefore be denied. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAs the record in this case reveals, with discovery complete and on the eve of trial on the \nmerits, much remains unsettled, and genuine issues of material fact continue to be unresolved. \nIndeed, only one dispute can truly be decided: based on well-settled jurisprudence, Articles 658 \nand 899 must be declared facially constitutional. Accordingly, for these reasons, this Court \nDENIES the Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (Doc. 76), and the Defendants' \nMotion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 74). \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on June 23, 2016. \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAV  ELLES \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n30 of30 ",
