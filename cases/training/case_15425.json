    "summary": "<p>On July 11, 2016, the New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, filed this lawsuit in the New York County Supreme Court on behalf of the people of New York. The plaintiff sued Armor Correctional Health Medical Services (“Armor”) under the New York False Claims Act §§ 189(1)(a) and (b), and also alleging that the defendant committed breach of contract and fraud. The plaintiff sought declaratory relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, a permanent injunction barring the defendant from bidding on future health services contracts in New York or engaging in the allegedly fraudulent actions, and an independent monitor to oversee compliance with the current contract. Judge Arlene Bluth was assigned to the case.</p><p>Armor has contracted to provide health care services to inmates at the Nassau County Correctional Center since June 2011, and at Niagara County’s jail from December 2012 through October 2015. From 2011 through July 2016, fourteen total deaths occurred at these two facilities, multiple of which were found to be due to inadequate health care. The New York State Commission of Correction’s Medical Review Board found egregious lapses in medical care in seven of the fourteen deaths. A later investigation by the New York Attorney General’s office found that Armor had not met its contractual obligations to Nassau County as evidenced by the following: inadequate self-assessments (or “self-audits”) and inadequate continuous quality improvement processes that would ensure quality of healthcare services; deficient sick call procedures; failure to provide access to medications; inadequate diagnostic services; deficient mental health services; inadequate referrals to specialists; failure to maintain (i) its equipment and (ii) accurate and complete medical records; and inadequate staffing. </p><p>On October 4, 2016, the parties proposed a settlement agreement agreement to the court. Armor agreed to no longer seek new contracts in New York for three years and to pay the New York Attorney General’s office $350,000 ($250,000 of which will be distributed to Nassau County as reimbursement for Armor’s contractual obligations). After Judge Bluth approved the settlement agreement, the case was dismissed with prejudice. The case is now closed.</p>",

Media Gallery\nIndividuals in jails, like NCCC, often have complex medical needs and many have not\nnecessarily been connected to any health care.  At NCCC, inmates are entirely reliant on\nPress Releases\nArmor’s ability to provide the medical services required under the contract.  This lawsuit alleges\nthat Armor failed to meet numerous performance standards required under the contract, and\n2016\nyet it repeatedly billed Nassau County in full for the services provided.  It is alleged that this\nconduct constitutes false and fraudulent billing under New York’s False Claim Act, as well as\nJanuary\nillegal and deceptive business practices under Executive Law § 63(12).  It is also alleged that\nArmor’s failure to provide proper medical care can dramatically impact inmates’ medical February\nconditions:  of the twelve inmates who have died at NCCC since Armor started providing\nMarch\nservices, five of those inmates were later found by the NYS Commission on Correction to have\nreceived inadequate medical care. \n2015\nArmor allegedly failed to uphold numerous aspect of its contractual obligations, including:\nJanuary\nFebruary\nNot timely responding to inmates’ request for medical assistance, and at times\nfailing to respond entirely; March\nNot providing required reports regarding assessment of care and improvement April\nplans where audits show failures; May\nFailing to provide timely and continuous access to prescription medications; June\nJuly\nFailing to provide timely and effective diagnostic services, such as laboratory tests;\nAugust\nFailing to reliably provide important mental health services, such as treatment\nSeptember\nplans; \nOctober\nFailing to provide adequate access to off-site medical specialists; and\nNovember\nUnderstaffing key clinical and managerial positions, including leaving some\nDecember\npositions vacant for months at a time.\n2014\nThe lawsuit further alleges that while Armor is required to conduct an array of assessments\non the care it delivers, Armor has not produced records that demonstrate it has done so.  In\nJanuary\nparticular, Armor failed to conduct the required number of self-audits, and even when it did\nidentify areas of inadequate performance, it only rarely developed or implemented February\ncorrective action plans to address the identified problems, as it was obligated to do under March\nthe contract. \nApril\nThe lawsuit seeks to ensure that Armor fully complies with its obligations under the contract May\nand pays damages to the county.

Siegel, N.Y. Practice § 547, 973 (5th ed. 2011) .............................................................23 \n \nv \n \n6 of 47\n\n  The People of the State of New York, by Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General of the \nState of New York (“NYAG”), submit this Memorandum of Law in support of the Verified \nPetition.  \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n  Armor Correctional Health Services, Inc. (“Armor”) has repeatedly submitted false and \nfraudulent claims to Nassau County in connection with Armor’s contract to provide jail health \nservices to inmates at the Nassau County Correctional Center (“NCCC”).  Armor’s false claims \nspan a five-year period from 2011 to the present and include (a) charges for services that Armor \naltogether failed to provide and (b) charges for woefully and dangerously inadequate health \nservices.  In total, Nassau County has paid Armor more than $50 million under the contract.  \nEvery time a government contractor submits a false claim, it is an affront not only to the \ngovernment agency with which it has contracted, but ultimately to the taxpaying public.  Here, \nthe effect of Armor’s false claims is particularly acute: the false claims glossed over a failure to \nprovide key medical services to scores of inmates with a high incidence of physical and mental \nillness.  For some, Armor’s failures were even a matter of life and death. Tragically, twelve \ninmates have died at NCCC since 2011 – including one only days ago – and the New York State \nMedical Review Board expressly found that Armor provided inadequate medical care to five of \nthe eight decedents whose cases it has reviewed.  \n  Armor’s own documents leave no doubt that it sought payment for services that it either \ndid not perform or performed insufficiently:  \n  Amor’s contractually-required self-assessments (or “self-audits”) from 2011 through 2015 \nshow that Armor fell below the thresholds for adequate performance in approximately half \nthe assessments (70 of 137), with failures spanning twenty-seven different subject areas \nconcerning the provision of jail health services;  \n1 \n \n7 of 47\n\n  Armor’s self-audits also show that when it failed to adequately perform it often \ncompounded that failure by also failing to develop contractually-required corrective action \nplans to improve performance;  \n  Amor’s records show repeated failures to respond to inmates’ requests for medical services \nwithin the required timeframe (and, on occasion, failure to respond at all); \n  Armor’s self-audits, decedents’ medical records, and former inmates’ statements show that \ninmates frequently did not receive medication within twenty-four hours of a written \nprescription, as required by the contract for most medications; and \n  Armor’s internal staffing records show that it failed, for long periods of time, to fill an \narray of required staff positions, including key clinical and management positions.    \n  Armor’s false and fraudulent claims for payment also constitute fraudulent business \npractices in violation of Executive Law § 63(12), as do the many misrepresentations in its \nproposal to the county seeking the contract to provide health services at NCCC.   \n  The NYAG brings this summary proceeding seeking, inter alia, critical equitable relief, \nincluding oversight by a monitor and an injunction barring Armor from submitting proposals for \nfuture contracts with Nassau County.  Armor has consistently failed to perform critical services \nas required under the contract, and yet the county has continued to renew its contract (even \nthough the contract does not permit such renewals).  Swift injunctive relief is required to protect \nthe health of inmates at NCCC. \n  The undisputed and highly probative nature of the proof lends itself to a summary \nproceeding, which NYAG brings (1) under Executive Law § 63(12) and New York State False \nClaims Act (State Finance Law §§ 187 et seq.) for injunctive relief, civil penalties, damages, and \ncosts; and (2) in the alternative, under Executive Law §63-c for damages and injunctive relief for \n2 \n \n8 of 47\n\nArmor’s breach of contract.  For the reasons set forth below, as well as in the Verified Petition, \nthe affidavits and other documents annexed thereto, and the Affirmation of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Dorothea Caldwell-Brown, together with the exhibits attached thereto, the NYAG \nrequests that this Court: (a) declare that Armor’s practices and conduct violated State Finance \nLaw §189(1)(a)-(b) and Executive Law § 63(12), or, in the alternative, Executive Law § 63-c; (b) \npermanently enjoin and restrain Armor from engaging in the illegal and fraudulent practices \ndescribed herein, (c) appoint an independent monitor to oversee ongoing compliance with the \ncontract, (d) permanently enjoin Armor from bidding on future jail health services contracts in \nNew York State; (e) direct that Armor, pursuant to Finance Law § 189, pay treble damages and \npenalties of $12,000 for each violation, or, in the alternative, award Petitioner the monies that \nArmor without right obtained as a result of its breach of contract; (f) require an accounting by \nArmor to determine the amount of Nassau County’s damages; and (g) direct Armor to pay costs.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe facts relevant to this proceeding, which are more fully set forth in the Verified \nPetition, the Affirmation of Assistant Attorney General Dorothea Caldwell-Brown (the “DCB \nAff.”), and the exhibits annexed thereto and referred to therein, are summarized below. \nA.  NASSAU COUNTY’S CONTRACT WITH ARMOR FOR JAIL\n  HEALTH SERVICES \n  In 2009, Nassau County solicited bids through a request for proposal (“RFP”) process to \nfind a jail health services company to provide medical services at Nassau County Correctional \nCenter (“NCCC”).  DCB Aff. ¶ 18.1  Armor submitted a proposal in response, asserting its \nability and willingness to perform the services requested in the RFP.  DCB Aff. ¶ 18; Ex. 9. \n                                                 \n1 All references to exhibits in this Memorandum are references to exhibits to the Affirmation of Dorothea Caldwell-\nBrown.   \n3 \n \n9 of 47\n\n  In May 2011, two years after an RFP process that began in 2009, Nassau County entered \ninto a two-year contract with Armor to provide health care services to inmates and detainees \n(collectively referred to as “inmates”) at NCCC, with the contract year running from May to June \nof the following year.  DCB Aff. ¶ 18; Ex. 8. The county renewed the contract twice for two-year \nperiods, in May 2013 and May 2015, even though the contract only permitted two additional \none-year renewals.  DCB Aff. ¶ 18; Ex. 8 at 1, § 1.  The current contract will expire in May \n2017, and Nassau County issued a new RFP for this contract in March 2016.2  DCB Aff. ¶ 18. \n  The contract requires that Armor provide a full range of medical, mental health, and \ndental services, including on-site specialty services (such as physical therapy, dialysis, and \ninfectious disease services).  Id. ¶ 20; Ex. 9 at 1.1; Ex. 8.  Armor is also responsible for \nmaintaining a laboratory and infirmary, as well as discharge planning and a quality improvement \nprogram.  Id.    \n  In exchange for its services, Armor’s base payment started at approximately $10.5 \nmillion in 2011 and steadily increased to reach approximately $11.6 million for the contract year \nstarting in June 2015.  DCB Aff. ¶ 23.  The contract provides for monthly billing, which should \ninclude any adjustments based on Armor’s performance and its expenses from the previous \nmonth.  Ex. 8 at 21, § 6(d).  Armor collects its fee by submitting monthly “claim vouchers” \nstating the amount owed by Nassau County for the services rendered at NCCC.  DCB Aff. ¶ 27.   \n  The contract makes payment contingent on Armor’s submission of a claim voucher “that \n(a) states with reasonable specificity the services provided and the payment requested as \nconsideration for such services, (b) certifies that the services rendered and the payment requested \nare in accordance with [the contract], and (c) is accompanied by documentation satisfactory to the \n                                                 \n2 Notably, the County initiated this RFP process some months after the NYAG commenced its investigation into \nArmor. DCB Aff. ¶ 18, n. 14. \n4 \n \n10 of 47\n\nCounty supporting the amount claimed.”  DCB Aff. ¶ 26; Ex. 8 at 11, § 6(f).  Armor is also \nrequired to submit monthly reports on various indicators relating to its performance under the \ncontract, such as how often Armor timely responds to inmates’ requests for medical assistance \nand how often it provides timely full health assessments upon admission.  DCB Aff. ¶ 31; Ex. 8 \nat 7, § 4.   \n  The contract incorporates by reference several documents that set forth detailed standards \nfor how the covered services should be performed.  DCB Aff. ¶ 19.  Significantly, the contract \nexplicitly incorporates a 2002 settlement agreement between Nassau County and the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice that includes specific actions NCCC must take to provide adequate \nmedical care to its inmates.  Id. ¶ 19; Ex. 8 at 5, § 3(k)(1); Ex. 9 at 1.1.  The contract also \nexplicitly incorporates Armor’s proposal in response to Nassau County’s RFP, in which Armor \nmakes detailed representations concerning how it will perform the services required and meet all \napplicable laws and regulations, as well as satisfy the terms of the DOJ settlement agreement.  \nDCB Aff. ¶ 19; Ex. 8 at 3, § 3(a); Ex. 9.  Further, the contract requires that Armor adhere to the \nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care standards regarding jail health.  DCB Aff. \n¶ 19; Ex. 8 at 5, § 3(k)(1).   \n  The contract also sets forth benchmarks for satisfactorily meeting select requirements \nunder the contract (called “performance indicators”) and financial reductions for failing to meet \nthose benchmarks (for example, the “performance indicator” of seeing inmates within seventy-\ntwo hours of receipt of their requests for medical care has a “benchmark” of 90%, meaning for a \ngiven month Armor must timely respond to such “sick call” calls 90% of the time.  DCB Aff. \n¶ 29; Ex. 8, Attch. 2. Upon failure to meet that benchmark, Armor is subject to a fee reduction of \n$50 per patient not seen within seventy-two hours).  Id.  The contract requires that Armor include \n5 \n \n11 of 47\n\nany such reduction in the subsequent month’s claim voucher so payments to Armor are \nappropriately reduced.  DCB Aff. ¶ 29; Ex. 8 at 10 § (6)(d).   \n  Accordingly, the contract contains specific performance standards and quality measures \nthat delineate what constitutes adequate provision of health services under the contract.  For \nexample, the contract includes specific staffing requirements, timeframes for responding to \ninmates’ requests for medical consultations, requirements for providing and maintaining needed \nmedications, and requirements that Armor routinely perform self-audits to identify any problem \nareas, and, when necessary, that it develop and implement corrective action plans to address any \nidentified problems.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 49, 53-54, 65, 92-94, 190.  Payment is contingent on Armor’s \nperformance of its contractual obligations consistent with these standards and specific \nrequirements governing performance.  See supra, pp. 4-5.  While Nassau County initially had a \nmonitor to oversee compliance with the contract, that position became vacant in 2013 and was \nnever subsequently filled.  DCB Aff. ¶ 32.  \nB.  ARMOR DID NOT MEET NUMEROUS OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED \nUNDER THE CONTRACT  \n1.  Armor Did Not Conduct Continuous Quality Improvement \nAssessments or Create Corrective Action Plans Consistent with its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  Armor is contractually-required to perform numerous monthly, semi-annual, and annual \nassessments as part of its continuous quality improvement program to monitor the quality of care \nprovided to inmates and its compliance with its contractual obligations, and it guaranteed that it \nwould perform such reviews in its proposal.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 40-46; Ex. 8 at 8, §5; Ex. 9 at 1.28-\n1.29.  Through these reviews, Armor could evaluate and improve the quality of its services and \nits compliance with various contractual requirements concerning the provision of health care \nservices.  However, Armor’s documents reflect it did not perform the required reviews, and \n6 \n \n12 of 47\n\nArmor’s Senior Vice President admitted under oath that Armor failed to fully comply with each \nof these continuous quality improvement program requirements.  DCB Aff.  ¶¶ 37-38, 50-51. \n  Specifically, Armor is contractually required to perform at least the following \nassessments, and in most instances did not adhere to the contractual requirements: \n  “Continuous quality improvement” reviews to determine areas in need of improvement.  \nDCB Aff. ¶ 49; Ex. 9 at 1.28.  Armor is required to perform at least four to five such \nreviews (referred to herein as “self-audits”) each month “to ensure continuous monitoring \nof key indicators at a frequency designed to comply with accreditation standards.”  Id.  \nThe subject areas of those self-audits are pre-determined by Armor’s corporate office, \nalthough Armor staff at NCCC must also identify additional areas to be audited based on \nNCCC’s specific needs.3  DCB Aff. ¶ 49.  Armor barely performed half the audits that \nwere required.  Id. ¶ 51.   \n   “[A]t least two process and two outcome/quality improvement studies” each year.  Id. \n¶ 42; Ex. 9 at 1.28.  A process study examines the effectiveness of the health care \ndelivery system by investigating systemic problems, and outcome/quality studies look \nclosely at certain health outcomes among inmates.  DCB Aff.  ¶ 43.  Armor has no record \nof performing these studies.4  Id. ¶ 48.   \n  “[A]n annual review of the [Quality Improvement Program] . . . to evaluate the program’s \n                                                 \n3 Self-audits are characterized by service area (e.g., requests for medical care and outpatient referrals) and consist of \nevaluating various aspects of providing that service in a random sample of approximately ten medical records to \ndetermine if the service was adequately performed.  For example, a mental health audit consists of an evaluation of \nfourteen different aspects of providing mental health services, including timely screenings, timely consultations with \nappropriate staff, development of treatment plans when needed, and proper documentation of that patient’s care.  \nDuring the audit, an Armor employee reviews the randomly-selected medical records to determine if each of the \nelements comprising the audit were properly performed. DCB Aff. ¶ 49, n. 21.   \n4 Executive Law § 63(12) vests the NYAG with authority to “take proof and make a determination of the relevant \nfacts, and to issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil practice law and rules.”  Pursuant to this authority, the \nNYAG issued a subpoena to Armor seeking a wide range of documents in connection with its provision of health \nservices at NCCC.  DCB Aff. ¶ 4, Ex. 1.  For purposes of this Petition, NYAG is making a good-faith assumption \nthat Armor produced all responsive documents.  \n7 \n \n13 of 47\n\neffectiveness.”  Id. ¶ 42; Ex. 9 at 1.28.  Armor has no record of performing these annual \nreviews.  DCB Aff. ¶ 48.   \n  Semi-annual operational reviews of certain substantive areas, including sick calls, mental \nhealth, and specialty care, performed by Armor’s corporate office.  Id. ¶ 45; Ex. 9 at 1.29.  \nArmor has no record of conducting these semi-annual reviews.  DCB Aff. ¶ 48.   \n  Semi-annual “Performance Enhancement Reviews [that] include review and audit of each \nof Armor’s contractual obligations with NCCC.”  Id. ¶ 46; Ex. 9 at 1.58.  Armor has no \nrecord of conducting these reviews.  DCB Aff. ¶ 48. \n  Armor’s failure to perform the monthly self-audits is particularly egregious: its own \nrecords demonstrate that it failed to perform approximately half of the audits required, even \nthough such assessments are critical for continuously monitoring its performance in areas that \nare essential to providing inmates with adequate medical care.  From 2011 through 2015, Armor \nconducted only 137 self-audits instead of the 240-300 required under the contract.  Id. ¶ 51. \n   The contract further requires that Armor create corrective action plans (“CAPs”) to \naddress deficiencies found as a result of the self-audits and semi-annual reviews, but these key \nplans were not developed for over 60% of its self-audit failures.  Id. ¶ 57; Ex. 9 at 1.19.  This \nmeans Armor took no formal action to resolve identified issues concerning its provision of \nmedical care.  CAPs are a key component for improving the quality of health services once a \nproblem has been identified through an audit: they set forth specific steps to resolve the \ndeficiencies, identify the people engaged in the problem-solving tasks, set forth monitoring and \nevaluation processes, and specify dates for delineated tasks to be completed.  DCB Aff. ¶ 54.    \n  From 2011 through 2015, Armor failed 70 of the 137 self-audits (51%) it actually \n8 \n \n14 of 47\n\nperformed, with these failures spanning across 27 of the 33 subject areas evaluated.  Id. ¶ 55.5  \nArmor only developed CAPs to address 26 of those 70 audit failings, leaving forty-four failed \naudits without any CAPs.  Id.  ¶ 57.  In key service areas, Armor never developed corrective \naction plans despite routinely failing most of the self-audits performed in those areas.  For \nexample, Armor only developed two CAPs addressing specialty consultation referrals, but not in \nresponse to the five failed audits in that category.  Id. ¶¶ 57, 158, 160. \nEven when CAPs were developed, they were not consistently implemented.  While \nimplementation should be documented in the Continuous Quality Improvement meeting minutes, \nthese minutes do not reflect that CAPS were regularly implemented and their effectiveness re-\nevaluated, as required under the contract.  Id. ¶¶ 41, 58.  For example, Armor devised a \ncorrective action plan to address its failure in performing diagnostic services (again, despite four \nself-audit failures), but there is no indication in Armor’s records that the plan was implemented \nor its effectiveness evaluated.  Id. \n2.  Armor Did Not Implement a Sick Call System Consistent With Its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  The contract requires that Armor implement and operate a sick call system through which \ninmates can request and obtain health care treatment by submitting request forms.  DCB Aff. \n¶ 65; Ex. 8 at 3-4, §§ 3(a),(f); Ex. 9 at 1.10.  Under the contract, a registered nurse must “triage” \n– i.e., assess and refer for appropriate care – an inmate’s sick call form within twenty-four hours \nof pick up, and a clinician must see the inmate within forty-eight to seventy-two6 hours of receipt \nof the sick call.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 65-66.   \n                                                 \n5 An audit score below 90% constitutes a failure.  DCB Aff. ¶ 52.   \n6 The contract requires that inmates be seen within forty-eight hours of Armor’s receipt of the request (and seventy-\ntwo for weekends), although fee reductions are only imposed after seventy-two hours. DCB Aff. ¶ 71; Ex. 8, Attch. \n2.  Armor’s proposal specifically represents that a licensed nurse will visit the inmate within forty-eight hours of \nreceipt of a sick call request.  Ex. 9 at 1.10.     \n9 \n \n15 of 47\n\n  While Armor only conducted two self-audits on this service over the course of the \ncontract (one of which it failed), NYAG’s analysis of Armor’s January and February 2016 Sick \nLogs reveals there were, respectively, 2,827 and 2,660 sick call requests, and Armor’s clinicians \nonly timely responded to approximately 37% of those requests in January and 28% of these \nrequests in February.  Id. ¶¶ 56, 72; Ex. 15, Attch. 4; Ex. 17.   \n  In some of these cases, inmates filed repeated sick call requests, and Armor delayed \nweeks before arranging for a clinician visit. DCB Aff. ¶ 74; Ex. 17.  Indeed, Armor’s own \nproviders often noted that inmates were not receiving timely follow-up care in the sick logs \nthemselves. DCB Aff. ¶ 75, Exs. 18-20. Incredibly, at one point in 2015, sick call slips were not \npicked up for many days because the collection box key was missing. DCB Aff. ¶ 76; Ex. 21.    \n  Individual inmates’ experiences also reflect Armor’s failure to satisfy this contractual \nobligation.  One former inmate with a medical history significant for psychiatric and medical \nillness filed multiple sick call requests soon after admission to obtain prescribed medications he \nwas already taking.  DCB Aff. ¶ 81; Affidavit of William Hine, dated May 26, 2016 (“Hine \nAff.”) ¶¶ 5-10.  Despite experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, and chills, Armor failed to provide him \nwith any of his psychiatric medications for almost a week after his admission.  Hine Aff. ¶ 11.  \nArmor delayed more than two weeks in assigning medical staff to examine him, and even then \nmost of his medical issues were not attended to.  Id. ¶¶ 15-16.  Another inmate who was detained \nweeks after having heart surgery filed multiple sick calls for medical attention for his cardiac \ncondition and related medical issues, but, despite the seriousness of his medical condition and \nrecent history of major surgery, Armor’s clinicians often responded several weeks later, and \nsometimes not at all.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 164-67; Affidavit of Jeffrey Anlyan, dated June 14, 2016 \n(“Anlyan Aff.”) ¶¶ 7-12.  Yet another inmate was hospitalized for a urinary tract infection after \n10 \n \n16 of 47\n\nArmor ignored – for weeks – his sick call requests in which he indicated that he felt weak, had \nchest pains, and had blood in his urine.  DCB Aff. ¶ 84; Ex. 26.   \n3.  Armor Did Not Provide Access to Medications Consistent with Its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  The contract requires that Armor give medications in a timely, continuous and clinically \nappropriate manner so as to maintain therapeutic treatment levels and avoid adverse \nconsequences to inmates’ health, and all medications must be recorded on inmates’ medical \ncharts.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 93-94; Ex. 9 at 1.22, 1.24; Ex. 13 at J-D02.  To that end, Armor must \nmaintain a stock of approved medications and arrange for a back-up pharmacy so that new \nmedication orders are timely administered to inmates, and inmates must receive formulary \nmedications within 24 hours of the written prescription.  DCB Aff. ¶ 92; Ex. 9 at 1.22 - 1.24; Ex. \n8, Attch. 2. \n  Contrary to its medication obligations, Armor’s self-audits, decedents’ medical records \nand former inmates’ statements reflect that inmates did not receive necessary medications in a \ntimely manner.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 99-126.  Over the course of the contract period, Armor failed \nnearly three-quarters of its self-audits (8 out of 11) conducted on medication administration.  Id. \n¶ 56; Ex. 15, Attch. 3.    \n  This inadequate performance is reflected in inmates’ experiences.  For example, one \ninmate died after Armor failed to provide him with medications prescribed by its own nurse for \nasthma and productive cough (among other conditions) and the State Medical Review Board \nfound that Armor did not perform an adequate admission exam on the decedent and did not \nprovide him with critical medications.  Id. ¶¶ 101-03; Ex. 7 at ¶ 1, 14; Ex. 28.  Another Armor \ninmate was taking two HIV medications at the time she was incarcerated, and yet Armor only \never provided her with one of the two at any given time (in addition to not providing her anti-\n11 \n \n17 of 47\n\npsychotic medications) and twice failed to provide either of the medications for a full week.  \nAffidavit of Shirley Quirk, dated June 8, 2016 (“Quirk Aff.”) ¶¶ 4-5.  By the time she was \nreleased, her HIV viral load was higher, which her treating nurse attributed to her not receiving \none of her needed medications.  Quirk Aff. ¶ 6; Affidavit of Patricia Dellatto, dated June 17, \n2016 (“Delatto Aff.”) ¶ 6.   \n  Another inmate reports being told by an Armor nurse, during his initial intake health \nexam, that he would not be getting all of the medications he was currently taking and “will be \nlucky to get Motrin.” Hine Aff. ¶ 9.  That same inmate was not even given all of his Armor-\napproved medications, including needed pain medications, and he became increasingly weak and \ntired.  He ultimately lost consciousness and fell on the floor, leading to a concussion.  Id. ¶¶ 24-\n25.  He was admitted to the hospital and, upon release, was informed by Armor’s medical \ndirector that he would not receive all the medications on the hospital discharge notes because \n“just because it is written on the hospital discharge doesn’t mean that you will get it.”).  Id. ¶¶ \n31-33.   Other inmates experienced similar delays in accessing needed medications and refusals \nto provide necessary medications.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 104-107, 110-11; Exs. 29, 30, 31; Affirmation of \nMarc Gann, Esq., dated June 1, 2016 (“Gann Aff.”); Dellatto Aff. at ¶ 9. \n4.  Armor Did Not Provide Diagnostic Services Consistent with its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  Under the contract, Armor is required to perform various diagnostic and laboratory \nservices on-site as needed.  Critical findings must be reported to clinicians within three hours and \nnon-critical results are to be reported to clinicians within five days.  All such results are to be \ndocumented in the medical record. DCB Aff. ¶ 95, Ex. 8 at 4, §§ 3(i) and 3(j).   \nArmor’s self-audits, however, demonstrate that it failed to provide laboratory and x-ray \nservices in an effective and timely manner.  For example, Armor’s August 2015 self-audit of \n12 \n \n18 of 47\n\ndiagnostic services showed that, in 67% of the sampled cases, Armor failed to document in the \nmedical record the time and date that a laboratory test or x-ray was obtained, decreasing the \nutility of such testing.  DCB Aff. ¶ 122. Over the past five years, Armor has failed four of the six \nself-audits conducted assessing its provision of diagnostic services.  Id. ¶ 121; Ex. 15, Attch. 1.  \nThis is reflected in inmates’ experiences: one inmate reported being told he could only have one \nx-ray performed of one part of his body, even though he was experiencing chronic pain in \nmultiple areas.  Hine Aff. ¶ 20. \nIn some instances, the tests ordered by an Armor clinician were never performed.  For \nexample, one decedent’s medical record reflects that he had a respiratory ailment and Armor’s \nclinician ordered an x-ray, but the x-ray was never performed.  The State Medical Review Board \nnoted the decedent’s symptomatic underlying respiratory condition in citing Armor’s failure to \nperform a “crucial diagnostic exam [X-ray].  DCB Aff. ¶ 125, Ex. 7 at ¶ 15.  \n  Further, even when documentation shows that the lab tests were performed, Armor’s \nAugust 2015 self-audit report revealed that Armor failed to consistently collect laboratory \nspecimens within seventy-two hours of being ordered.  DCB Aff. ¶ 123-124, Ex.15, Attch. 1  \nSimilarly, audit records revealed that Armor failed to consistently ensure that the laboratory \nand/or x-ray services performed matched those ordered by the clinician. Id.      \n5.  Armor Did Not Provide Mental Health Services Consistent With Its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  Armor is required under the contract to develop mental health treatment plans and \nprovide appropriate follow-up care for inmates identified with mental illness.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 127- \n129.  The contract, through its incorporation of the Department of Justice settlement, specifically \nrequires the development and implementation of treatment plans for inmates with special needs, \nincluding inmates with mental illness.  Id. ¶ 127; Ex. 8 at 5, § 3(k)(1); Ex. 8, Attch. 3.  Armor is \n13 \n \n19 of 47\n\nalso required, for inmates who require continuous supervision related to their mental health, to \nhave “contemporaneous treatment plan(s)” that reflect, inter alia, intervention(s) for the inmate.  \nDCB Aff. ¶ 128; Ex. 8, Attch. 2.  \n  Similarly, in its proposal (which is incorporated into the contract), Armor repeatedly \nrepresented that it would provide mental health treatment planning to guide treatment and care.  \nDCB Aff. ¶ 129; Ex. 9 at 1.34-1.35.  For example, the proposal states that “Armor develops an \ninitial Treatment Plan during the mental health evaluation,” and claims that one of the “key \ncomponents” of its mental health/behavioral service program is “Multidisciplinary Treatment \nPlans.” Id.  \n  However, Armor’s records reflect that it routinely failed to complete mental health \ntreatment plans and provide appropriate follow-up care.  Armor’s self-audits document Armor’s \nfailure to complete mental health treatment plans, and Armor’s clinicians have also noted on \nSick Logs that Armor failed to refer inmates for mental health evaluations.  DCB Aff.  ¶ 130.   \n  Further, the State Medical Review Board’s review of two inmates’ deaths in 2012 and \n2014 found that Armor provided inadequate psychiatric care.  Id. ¶¶ 134- 144.  One case \ninvolved an Iraq war veteran with a history of post-traumatic stress disorder, bi-polar disorder \nand opioid abuse.  Id. ¶ 136; Ex. 32.  Armor’s psychiatrist overlooked or otherwise neglected to \ndocument his mental health histories, and no psychiatric follow-ups were planned.  Id.  The \ninmate committed suicide in his cell, and the State Medical Review Board found that the Armor \npsychiatrist’s assessment was “inadequate in not properly accounting for and addressing” the \ninmate’s PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and need for medications.  Ex. 4 at 3.   \n  Despite Armor’s poor performance in this area and the clear need for assessment and \nimprovement, it failed to perform the contractually-required semi-annual mental health \n14 \n \n20 of 47\n\nassessments and only performed four mental health self-audits since 2011.  Id. ¶ 146.   \n6.  Armor Did Not Refer Inmates for Specialty Care Consistent With Its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  The contract requires that Armor provide certain specialty services onsite and refer \ninmates for off-site specialty care when Armor cannot meet their medical needs onsite. DCB Aff. \n¶¶ 150-51; Ex. 9 at 1.7, 1.51-1.52.  Armor also represented in its proposal that when requests for \noff-site specialty care are “deferred,” the requesting provider will “then outline[] an alternative \nplan of care or submit[] further information,” and the inmate will be reevaluated within thirty \ndays.  Ex. 9 at 1.17.  However, from September 2011 through September 2015, Armor’s self-\naudits reflect a consistent pattern of inappropriate and failed practices relating to off-site \nspecialty referrals, demonstrating non-compliance with the contract: over the course of the \ncontract, Armor has failed all five of its self-audits in this area. DCB Aff. ¶ 153; Ex. 15, Attch. 8. \n  Armor is responsible for deciding whether to deny or approve its clinicians’ requests for \nspecialty referrals, and yet records reflect that it frequently failed to make such decisions at all.  \nDCB Aff. ¶ 154.  Moreover, it wasn’t until December 2015 – after an egregious incident \nwhereby an inmate’s referral to an off-site oral surgery consultation was delayed despite having a \ncomplex jaw fracture – that Armor realized it did not have a process for handling requests that \nwere incomplete or pending information needed to make a determination.  Id. ¶ 159.  \nEven when Armor did deny or approve a request, it often failed to implement alternative \nplans for follow-up care when the requests were denied and failed to ensure that the requested \nspecialty care was timely received when requests were approved.  Id. ¶¶ 155-156.  Armor’s \nrecords show that it did not reliably schedule off-site specialty services within thirty days of the \napproval as required under its own policy, delaying needed care and jeopardizing inmates’ \nhealth.  Id. ¶ 156.    \n15 \n \n21 of 47\n\nOne inmate’s experience particularly reflects Armor’s handling of specialty requests:  A \nformer NCCC inmate reported that his requests for an off-site cardiology evaluation were \ndiscouraged by Armor clinicians, who said the requests would be denied by Armor’s corporate \noffice.  Anlyan Aff. ¶13.  After about sixteen months at NCCC, he sued Armor, alleging that it \nfailed to meet his medical needs.  Id. ¶14; DCB Aff. ¶¶ 83, 166.  Shortly thereafter, Armor \narranged for him to see a cardiologist who, upon examining him, immediately referred him for \ncardiac angioplasty.  Anlyan Aff. ¶16; DCB Aff ¶ 166. \n7.  Armor Did Not Create and Maintain Medical Records Consistent \nwith its Contractual Obligations and Representations \n  Under the contract, Armor is required to properly create and maintain comprehensive \nmedical records for each inmate.  DCB Aff. ¶ 176.   Such medical records must include current \nnotes from all health care providers, including medication administration records and diagnostic \nreports.  Id. ¶ 177.   Armor’s proposal, incorporated into the contract, stated it could install a \n“turnkey” electronic record system that would reduce the probability of error, eliminate legibility \nissues, and have easily-accessible data, in addition to a host of other benefits, and provision of \nthis service is included in the county’s monthly payment.  Id. ¶¶ 20, 178; Ex. 9 at 1.40-1.43.    \n  Despite this requirement for comprehensive medical records, an electronic record system \nhas not yet been implemented and medical records were sometimes not available when needed: \nin just two months (January and February 2016), over 150 charts were not available when \ninmates requested medical consultations, meaning their requests for care were ignored or delayed \nbecause Armor failed to perform one of its most basic, yet critical, functions: making inmates’ \nmedical records available.  Id. ¶ 74.  Even medical records that could be located had other \ninadequacies, including not setting forth the date inmates were examined and illegible clinician \nsignatures.  Id. ¶¶ 183-186.  Notably, the position of medical records director was understaffed, \n16 \n \n22 of 47\n\nand at times vacant, from July 2013 through mid-May 2015.  Id. ¶193, Ex. 40.   \n8.  Armor Did Not Maintain Medical Equipment Consistent with its \nContractual Obligations and Representations \n  Armor is required to, “at a minimum,” have certain equipment available for the \nexamination and treatment of inmates, including automated external defibrillators, and must \nensure that such emergency equipment are available and checked regularly. DCB Aff. ¶ 187; Ex. \n13 at J-D-03.  However, Armor’s September 2015 self-audit of its clinical equipment and \nsupplies revealed that it failed to check its AED defibrillator as recommended by the \nmanufacturer and failed to check the emergency crash cart every shift.  Id. ¶ 188.  Notably, this is \none of only two audits ever conducted by Armor in this crucial service area. Id. \n9.  Armor Did Not Staff NCCC Consistent With Its Contractual \nObligations and Representations \n  The contract sets forth jail staffing requirements, including specific positions that must be \nprovided and the number of full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees that must be staffed in those \npositions, and Armor also staffs positions not identified in the contract.  Ex. 8, Attch. 1; Ex. 10.  \nThe initial contract provided for a staff of 74.5 FTEs, including a Health Services Administrator, \na Director of Nursing, a Medical Director, and a Mental Health Director as managers, and a mix \nof clinical and administrative staff, including a physician, psychiatrist, various levels of nurses \n(charge, registered and licensed practical), and other allied medical and mental health \nprofessionals.  DCB Aff. ¶ 23; Ex. 10.  In May 2013, when the contract was renewed, the \nstaffing was revised to 76.9 FTEs.   DCB Aff. ¶ 24; Ex. 8, Attch. 1.  Armor’s staffing records for \nthe period covering June 2011 to November 2015 show that Armor did not fulfill its staffing \nobligations under the contract, even for clinicians and the most senior management positions.  \nDCB Aff. ¶¶ 191- 193; Ex. 40.   \n  Over the course of the contract, Armor left several key positions vacant and/or \n17 \n \n23 of 47\n\nunderstaffed, thereby failing to meet its contractual staffing obligations, including: \n  Director of Nursing: The contract requires one FTE in this position, which is responsible \nfor guiding and directing the nursing staff, including ensuring that relevant policies and \nprocedures are current and properly followed, yet it was vacant from June 2012 through \npart of February 2013 (7.5 months); \n  Mental Health Clinical Coordinator: The contract requires one FTE in this position, \nwhich is responsible for coordinating mental health services, yet it was vacant from April \n2014 through November 2015 (nineteen months);  \n  Psychiatric Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant (“ARNP/PA”): \nThe contract requires .6 FTEs in this position, which is part of the mental health \ntreatment team, yet it was vacant from June 2013 to November 2014 (sixteen months); \n  Utilization manager: The contract requires at least one FTE for this position, which is \nresponsible for managing patients’ access to off-site and on-site specialty care, yet it was \nvacant from June 2013 through November 2015 (2.5 years); and \n  Continuous Quality Improvement and Nurse Educator: The contract requires at least one \nFTE in this position, which has many responsibilities relating to nurse education and the \ncontinuous quality improvement program, yet it was vacant from November 2014 \nthrough November 2015 (one year). \nDCB Aff. ¶ 192; Ex. 40. \n  Nassau County’s estimated overpayment for these vacancies is $484,795. Id. ¶ 194.  In \naddition to the above-listed vacancies, Armor also understaffed other important positions, \nproviding fewer FTEs than contractually required, including: \n  Masters-level Mental Health Professionals: Armor was contracted to provide 4.8 masters-\n18 \n \n24 of 47\n\nlevel MHPs, but in the 2014-2015 contract year, it understaffed that position every month \nout of the year, staffing this position at 84.64% of the required FTEs for that year; \n  Psychiatric ARNP/PAs: Armor was required to provide .6 psychiatric ARNP/PAs, and \nyet, in addition to leaving the position vacant for over a year, it then understaffed the \nposition from November 2014 through November 2015, with an average percent staffed \nfor the 2014-2015 contract year of 31.31% and an average of 50% for June 2015 through \nNovember 2015; and \n  Medical Records Director:  Armor was required to staff one FTE for the position of \nmedical records director, yet this position was understaffed, and at times vacant, from \nJuly 2013 through mid-May 2015, with an average staffing percentages of just 32.43% \nand 39.11% for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 contract years, respectively. \nDCB Aff. ¶ 193; Ex. 40. \nC.  ARMOR BILLED NASSAU COUNTY THE FULL MONTHLY AMOUNT \nOWED FOR MONTHS IN WHICH ARMOR DID NOT MEET ITS \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  \n  From 2011 to the present, Armor submitted claim vouchers for payment on a monthly \nbasis for one-twelfth of the annual contract price.  DCB Aff. ¶ 27.  The contract requires that \nthese vouchers state the services provided with “reasonable specificity,” be supported by \ndocumentation, and certify that the services were rendered and payment was requested in \naccordance with the contract.  Id. ¶ 26; Ex. 8, § 6(f) at 11.  This information and documentation \nare necessary to ensure Armor properly bills for the services rendered, and yet Armor failed to \nfully satisfy these obligations, and billed the county for months when the services were not \nprovided in full.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 27-28.    \n  Each claims voucher contains a certification stating:  \n19 \n \n25 of 47\n\nI hereby certify that this claim voucher is just, true and correct; that the amount \nclaimed is actually due and owing and has not been previously claimed . . . I \nfurther certify that all items and/or services were delivered or rendered as set forth \nin this claim, and for all items and/or services delivered or rendered in accordance \nwith a purchase order or contract that the prices charged are in accordance with \nthe reference purchase order or contract.  For all claims made as reimbursement \nfor employee expenses, I further certify that the amounts set forth were actually \nand necessarily expended for the benefit of Nassau County . . . \n   \nId. ¶ 26, n. 19; Ex. 11.   \n  To support its claims vouchers, Armor is also required to provide Nassau County with \nmonthly reports containing important information about Armor’s provision of services.7  DCB \nAff. ¶ 31; Ex. 8 at 7-8, § 4.  However, Armor’s monthly reports do not comport with the \ncontract’s requirements.  DCB Aff. ¶ 33.  Approximately half of the twenty-four contractually \nrequired indicators were not listed in the monthly report template, including key information on \nArmor’s provision of health services, such as (a) the number of new admits who receive health \nscreens at intake and the percentage seen within four hours; (b) the percentage of inmates \nreceiving full health assessments within seven days; and (c) the number of inmates who request \naccess to medical or mental health care and the percentage who are then seen within seventy-two \nhours of their request.  Id.    \n  Additionally, the claims vouchers did not specify the services provided as the basis for \nthe monthly payment, but stated only, for most months, that payment was for “medical health \nservices” or “health services.”  Id. ¶ 28.  Further, despite the voucher’s certification, Armor never \nreduced the amount owed to reflect that its services were not performed consistent with its \ncontractual requirements, including never providing the contractually-required financial \n                                                 \n7 While Armor’s Senior Vice President testified that Nassau County Sheriff’s Office employees said Armor did not \nhave to send certain reports or information, and indeed the county has not had a contract monitor since 2013, Armor \nhas never produced any evidence that these contractual requirements were formally amended.  The contract can only \nbe amended with “prior written consent of the County Executive or his or her duly designated deputy.”  The contract \nfurther states: “The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement, including the right to demand \nstrict performance, shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.”  DCB Aff. ¶ 21; Ex. 8 at 15-16, § 13.   \n20 \n \n26 of 47\n\nreductions for not adequately performing its obligations under the contract.  Id. ¶ 30.  Moreover, \nArmor did not disclose, through any monthly reports sent to the county or any other written \ndocumentation, its underperformance or non-performance of the contractually-required services \nfor each and every month in which adjustments to the fee were appropriate.  Id. ¶ 34.     \n  Fee reductions, however, were required due to Armor’s failure to fully perform its \ncontractual obligations.  For example: \n  Armor allocated $78,688 of the contract cost to electronic medical records in the first \nyear of the contract alone, and $81,056 in the second year, yet it has not yet implemented \nthis system – which was already developed – and never reduced the amount owed by the \nCounty for not providing this service.  DCB Aff. ¶ 159; Ex. 9, Attch. 1.   \n  From 2011 through 2015, Armor failed seventy self-audits, each of which required the \ndevelopment of a CAP.  However, instead of developing seventy CAPs, Armor only \ncreated twenty-six.  DCB Aff. ¶ 57.  The contract sets forth a reduction of $100 per day \nfor each CAP not completed within forty-five days from the date of the occurrence.  Id. \n¶ 61.  A conservative cost estimate for Armor’s failure to develop at least forty-four \nCAPs is $528,000.  Id. ¶ 62.   \n  For January and February 2016, there is no record that Armor’s clinicians ever saw \ninmates in approximately 34% and 32%, respectively, of all sick call requests, and, when \nan Armor clinician did respond, 44% and 60% of those visits, respectively, were not \nwithin seventy-two hours of Armor’s receipt of the request, meaning a total of just 37% \nand 28% of requests were timely handled.  Id. ¶ 72.  Fee reductions are triggered if fewer \nthan 90% of inmates are not seen by a clinician within seventy-two hours of Armor’s \nreceipt of the request.  Armor’s performance falls well below that benchmark, triggering \n21 \n \n27 of 47\n\na reduction of $50 per inmate not seen within seventy-two hours of Armor’s receipt of \nthe request.  Nassau County’s fee, however, was not reduced for these months.  Id. ¶ 29.  \nBased on this two-month sample alone, Armor should refund at least $123,450. Id. ¶ 88.8   \n  Armor never reduced its monthly fee to reflect vacancies or understaffing, which for the \nvacancies alone, for the positions identified herein, amounts to approximately $484,795.  \nId. ¶ 194.  \n  Moreover, Armor’s failure of so many self-audits in a wide range of subject areas \nsuggests that further financial reductions should have been applied.  Id. ¶¶ 55-56.  Each of the \nself-audits Armor performed fall under one of the contractual “performance indicators” for \nwhich there is a financial reduction upon failing to meet the benchmark.9   \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR SPECIAL PROCCEDINGS \n  Executive Law § 63(12) empowers the NYAG to bring a special proceeding for \npermanent injunctive relief, restitution, damages, and civil penalties whenever a person or \nbusiness engages in “repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or otherwise demonstrate[s] persistent  \nfraud or illegality in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.”  A special \nproceeding under Executive Law § 63(12) is “plenary as an action, culminating in a judgment, \nbut is brought on with the ease, speed and economy of a mere motion.” David D. Siegel, N.Y. \nPractice § 547, 973 (5th ed. 2011).  The legislative purpose for allowing a special proceeding \n                                                 \n8 This two-month sample illustrates Armor’s serious underperformance in one of the most important areas of its \nwork.  Even though it was contractually required to calculate this sick call data each month, it failed to ever do so \nover the five years of the contract.  While a full audit could be conducted over the five years to fully calculate all \ndamages owed, time is of the essence given the risk of continued inadequate care to inmates.  Upon information and \nbelief, the fee deduction would equal some $3.7 million extrapolating the fee reduction for the recent two-month \nsample to the 60-month course of the Contract.  DCB Aff. ¶ 89. \n   \n9 Under the contract, Armor bears the burden of demonstrating adequate performance on each of these measures, yet \nit has failed to do so.  Therefore, the People are constrained from seeking judgment and damages on these indicators \nat this time and instead seek relief only to the extent Armor’s non-performance and underperformance can be \nquantified based on the available documentation, as set forth in the Affirmation and Petition. \n22 \n \n28 of 47\n\nunder Executive Law § 63(12) is to further the public interest by providing an expeditious means \nto enjoin fraudulent or illegal activity and obtain relief for victims. State v. B.C. Assocs., 194 \nN.Y.S.2d 353, 356-58 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1959). \nA special proceeding goes right to the merits. The Court is required to make a summary \ndetermination upon all the pleadings, papers and admissions to the extent that no triable issues of \nfact are raised.  See NY Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”) 409.  To the extent factual \nissues are raised, then they must be tried “forthwith.”  CPLR 410.  It is the very purpose of a \nspecial proceeding to provide a summary remedy, “so summary, indeed, as to dispense with the \nneed or occasion for the application of summary judgment.” Council of the City of N.Y. v. \nBloomberg, 6 N.Y.3d 380, 401 (N.Y. 2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \nARGUMENT \nI.  ARMOR KNOWINGLY SUBMITTED FALSE CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT IN \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE FALSE CLAIMS ACT \n   Armor knowingly submitted false and fraudulent claims for payment to Nassau County \nby requesting payment: (a) for services that it did not render and (b) for services it rendered \ninconsistent with its contractual requirements.  These claims plainly violate the New York False \nClaims Act, which provides that any person who “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented \na false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval [or] knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be \nmade or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim . . . shall be liable \nto the state or a local government.”  State Finance Law § 189(1)(a)-(b) (the “NY False Claims \nAct” or “FCA”).  State Finance Law § 190(1) specifically empowers the NYAG to bring a civil \naction if a subordinate governmental entity has been presented with a false or fraudulent claim \nfor payment.  Since Nassau County has not initiated a civil action and has not indicated any \nwillingness to enforce the contract’s terms, NYAG brings this action to protect the county from \n23 \n \n29 of 47\n\nthe false and fraudulent claims being submitted by Armor for payment.  \nA.  Armor Knowingly Presented False or Fraudulent Claims to Nassau County \n1.  Armor Presented Claims for Payment to Nassau County \n  The threshold question in any action pursuant to the NY False Claims Act, State Finance \nLaw §§ 187 et seq., is whether a claim for payment was submitted.  Here, Armor’s payment \narrangement with Nassau County fits squarely within the FCA’s definition of “claim.”   The \nFCA defines “claim” as meaning, inter alia: “any request or demand, whether under a contract or \notherwise, for money or property that . . . is presented to an officer, employee or agent of the \nstate or a local government.” State Finance Law § 188(1)(a)(i). \n  Armor and Nassau County’s contract sets forth an annual rate, and each month Armor \npresented Nassau County with invoices for payment based on that annual rate.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 23, \n27.  Therefore, Armor presented employees and agents of a local government with a demand for \nmonetary payment pursuant to a contractual agreement.  As such, Armor presented claims for \npayment as defined in the FCA.  \n2.  Armor’s Claims Were False and Fraudulent \nThe claims submitted by Armor to Nassau County were false and fraudulent under the \nFCA.  The statute defines “false claim,” for purposes of violating State Finance Law § 189, to \nmean “any claim which is, either in whole or part false or fraudulent.”  State Finance Law \n§ 188(2).  Courts recognize two general categories of FCA violations: “legally false claims (a \nclaim provided in violation of a contract, specification, regulation or statute) and factually false \nclaims (a claim for goods or services not provided).”  United States v. Dialysis Clinic, Inc., No. \n5:09-CV-00710, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4862, at *39 (N.D.N.Y Jan. 19, 2011) (citing United \nStates ex rel. Conner v. Salina Reg’l Health Ctr., Inc., 543 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2008)); see \nalso United States. ex rel. Bilotta v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 50 F. Supp. 3d 497, 534 (S.D.N.Y \n24 \n \n30 of 47\n\n2014). \nArmor submitted claims for payment to Nassau County that were both legally and \nfactually false, because: (a) Armor presented claims for services that it did not deliver, and (b) \nArmor presented claims for services that it failed to render consistent with its contractual \nrequirements.  For each of these reasons, Armor improperly sought payment from Nassau \nCounty by presenting false and fraudulent claims for payment. \ni.  Armor Presented False and Fraudulent Claims for Payment By \nSeeking Payment Even When the Services Were Not Delivered \nArmor repeatedly presented claims seeking one month’s payment in full, even when it \nfailed to provide key services under the contract.  This practice – submitting a claim for services \nthat were never provided – is the very definition of a “factually false” claim under the FCA.  \nUnited States ex rel. Conner, 543 F.3d at 1217 (“In a run-of-the-mill ‘factually false’ case, \nproving falsehood is relatively straightforward: A relator must generally show that the \ngovernment payee has submitted . . . ‘a request for reimbursement for goods or services never \nprovided.”) (citing United States ex rel. Mikes v. Straus, 274 F.3d 687, 697 (2d Cir. 2001); \nMikes 274 F.3d at 697 (describing a “factually false” certification as involving, inter alia, “a \nrequest for reimbursement for goods or services never provided.”); United States ex rel. Bilotta, \n50 F. Supp. 3d at 534; see also United States and N.Y. ex rel. Ortiz v. Mt. Sinai Hospital et al., \nNo. 13 Civ. 4735, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153903 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2015) (denying Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss federal and state FCA causes of action for submitting improper bills to the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, including “phantom billing” for medical services that were \nnever performed).   \nExamples of Armor’s failure to provide the services for which Nassau County was \ncharged include: \n25 \n \n31 of 47\n\n  Failure to develop and implement corrective action plans to correct the findings in \nforty-four failed self-audits (DCB Aff. ¶ 57);  \n  Failure to implement an electronic health records system (Id. ¶ 178); and \n  Leaving vacant several positions and not providing the full staffing required under the \ncontract, including positions that are instrumental to providing adequate medical care to \nNCCC inmates (Id. ¶¶ 192-93).  \n  One of Armor’s most important contractual requirements is to monitor the quality of its \nservices through self-audits and to develop and implement corrective action plans (“CAPs”) \nwhenever it fails a self-audit.  DCB Aff. ¶ 54.  Given the importance of developing and \nimplementing CAPs, the contract sets forth a significant financial reduction for non-compliance: \nif performance falls below 90% (i.e., in a given month, Armor fails to develop and implement \nCAPs for at least 90% of identified failures during its self-audits), there is a $100 reduction per \nday for each review not completed within forty-five days of the deficiency.  Id. ¶¶ 60-61.  \nArmor’s performance fell far below the 90% benchmark: Armor failed to develop CAPs over \n60% of the time it failed a self-audit, leaving forty-four audit failures unaddressed.  Id. ¶ 57.  \nHowever, Armor never reduced the amount owed, meaning it falsely and fraudulently billed \nNassau County at least $528,000 based solely on its failure to develop CAPs.  Id. ¶ 62.   \n  The contract also requires that, when Armor fails to maintain staffing at 85% of the levels \nstated in the contract, it reduce the amount the County owes by the amount of the hourly or daily \nrate for each staff member whose position is vacant, for each day of the vacancy.  Ex. 8, Attch. 2.  \nAccordingly, under the clear terms of the contract, for each month in which a position was \nvacant or staffed at less than 85% of the contracted FTE amount, Armor was required to reduce \nthe amount charged to Armor.  Id.  It never did so, despite lengthy vacancies and understaffing \n26 \n \n32 of 47\n\nimportant positions by less than half the required FTEs. DCB Aff. ¶ 30.  Based on the vacancies \nalone, Armor overcharged Nassau County by an estimated $484,795. Id. ¶ 194. \n  Further, in its cost proposal, Armor allocated $78,688 of the contract cost to electronic \nmedical records in the first year of the contract alone, and $81,056 in the second year.  Id. ¶ 178; \nEx. 9, Attch. 1.  Yet Armor has not yet implemented electronic medical records and never \nreduced the amount owed by the county for this service.  DCB Aff. ¶ 178.   \nAs Armor never reduced the amount owed by Nassau County to account for its failure to \nprovide these services, Armor violated, and continues to violate, State Finance Law § 189(1)(a)-\n(b) by presenting claims for payment in full when the underlying services were not provided.     \nii.  Armor Presented False and Fraudulent Claims for Services That \nIt Failed to Render Consistent With its Contractual \nRequirements \nArmor also presented “legally false” claims for payment by seeking payment in full \ndespite not meeting the standards set forth in the contract when providing the services for which \nit sought payment.  Such false certifications of compliance with contractual provisions are \nactionable under the FCA.  The certifications may be “express” or “implied,” and Armor is \nsubject to liability under either theory. \nArmor expressly certified compliance because it submitted claim vouchers certifying that \nthe amount claimed is actually due, as required by the clear terms of the contract.  The contract \nspecifically requires that Armor certify the services were rendered in accordance with the \ncontract when submitting a claim for payment.  DCB Aff. ¶ 26; Ex. 8 at 11, § 6(f).  Given this \nrequirement, Armor expressly certified compliance by submitting claims for payment in full.   \nIn addition, Armor’s actions also satisfy the criteria for liability under the implied false \ncertification theory.  The United States Supreme Court recently recognized liability under the \nfederal FCA for “implied false certifications” of compliance with a contract’s terms so long as \n27 \n \n33 of 47\n\nthe contract terms at issue are “material to the Government’s payment decisions.”  Universal \nHealth Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar No. 15-7, slip op. at 1 (U.S. June 16, 2016), \nhttp://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-7_a074.pdf (involving a qui tam plaintiff’s \nclaim that a mental health facility submitted false Medicaid claims when employees at the \nfacility were not actually licensed to provide mental health counseling services or authorized to \nprescribe medicine).10   \nIn Escobar, the Supreme Court confirmed that the implied false certification theory can \nbe a basis for liability. Id.  Specifically: \n[L]iability can attach when the defendant submits a claim for payment that makes \nspecific representations about the goods or services provided, but knowingly fails \nto disclose the defendant’s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory, or \ncontractual requirement.  In those circumstances, liability may attach if the \nomission renders those representations misleading. \n \nId. at 1-2. \nThe Court further ruled that FCA liability for non-disclosure turns on whether the \n“defendant knowingly violated a requirement that the defendant knows is material to the \nGovernment’s payment decision.”  Id.  In this case, the facts establish that (1) Armor submitted \nmonthly claims seeking payment in full for all medical health services required under the \ncontract, (2) Armor routinely failed to provide certain of these services consistent with important \ncontractual requirements governing the quality of care provided, (3) those contractual \nrequirements were material to the county’s payment decision, and (4) Armor never disclosed its \nnon-compliance.  As a result, many of Armor’s claims for payment were misleading, and Armor \nis subject to liability under the FCA for all such misleading claims under the implied false \ncertification theory. \n                                                 \n10 Since the New York False Claims Act was based on the federal False Claims Act, 31 USC § 3729 et seq., it is \n“appropriate to look toward federal law when interpreting the New York act” as guidance in statutory \ninterpretation.  State ex rel. Seiden v. Utica First Ins. Co., 96 A.D.3d 67, 71 (1st Dept. 2012). \n28 \n \n34 of 47\n\nAccordingly, each and every month that Armor submitted a claim for payment without \ndisclosing that it did not provide services consistent with the terms of the contract, and without \nreducing the amount owed, Armor misrepresented the basis for payment and submitted a false \nand fraudulent claim to Nassau County.  This includes, but is not limited to, claims submitted for \nmonths in which Armor:  \n  Failed to examine inmates within seventy-two hours of receiving a sick call request, \nincluding when it failed to examine inmates at all;  \n  Failed to provide mental health services consistent with the contract, including not \ndeveloping and implementing treatment plans; \n  Failed to provide specialty referrals or arrange for specialty care following a referral \nwhen required under the contract; \n  Failed to perform ordered diagnostic services consistent with the contract’s requirements; \n  Failed to maintain medical records consistent with the contract’s requirements; and \n  Failed to maintain medical equipment consistent with the contract’s requirements; \n  Armor billed in full for those services, even though it failed to perform them consistent \nwith the contract’s explicit requirements that were designed to ensure high-quality medical care \nfor inmates, and it never disclosed its non-compliance despite knowing the significance of those \nrequirements.  Further, the significance and materiality of the specific contractual requirements \nfor each of those services are clear, as the contract: (a) requires rigorous self-auditing of these \nservices, (b) has specific reporting requirements relating to Armor’s performance of these \nservices, (c) conditions payment on compliance with the contract terms, including for these \nservices, and (d) has a schedule for reducing payments to Armor upon its failure to meet the \ncontract’s specific requirements for performance of these services.  Accordingly, Armor’s \n29 \n \n35 of 47\n\nnumerous areas of non-compliance, as set forth above in detail (see supra, Statement of Facts, \nSection B, pp. 6-22) are not small deviations from Armor’s contractual requirements, but rather \nsignificant deviations from Armor’s most fundamental obligations under the contract – indeed, \nthe very heart of the services that Armor was contracted to provide.  \n  Particularly egregious examples are months in which Armor failed to timely address sick \ncalls and failed to provide adequate access to specialty care.  Responding to inmates’ requests for \nmedical consultations is one of the most fundamental aspects of providing medical care.  The \n“sick call” system is the sole way inmates are able to access urgent and non-urgent health care \nservices.  By failing to abide by the contractual time constraints (clinician visit within forty-eight \nto seventy-two hours), Armor is improperly delaying access to needed care, allowing inmates’ \nmedical conditions to go untreated – even conditions that are urgent.  Despite the critical nature \nof this contractual obligation, Armor often failed to perform this basic function.  See supra, pp. \n9-11.  For example, at one point, sick calls were not picked up for days because the key to the \ncollection box went missing.  DCB Aff. ¶ 76; Ex. 21.  In at least two one-month periods in 2016, \nArmor failed to timely respond to 63% and 72% of requests, meaning the vast majority of \ninmates waited days before being seen by a clinician, if they were seen at all, risking \ndeterioration of the medical or psychiatric condition prompting the request.  DCB Aff. ¶ 72.  \nThis was as recent as five months ago, and well after Armor knew the NYAG was investigating \nit for such conduct.  \n  Armor is contractually required to provide a reduction of $50 per inmate not seen within \nseventy-two hours of when Armor receives the request.  DCB Aff. ¶ 88; Ex. 8, Attch. 2.  \nHowever, Armor never reduced the amount owed by Nassau County to reflect its failure to \n30 \n \n36 of 47\n\nprovide timely sick calls. 11  DCB Aff. ¶ 90.    \n  Similarly, access to needed specialists is a fundamental aspect of providing appropriate \nmedical services to inmates, and the failure to fully meet this contractual requirement can be \ndevastating.  Armor failed all of its self-audits for specialty consultation referrals, and the audits \ndemonstrate that Armor did not reliably act upon its own clinicians’ referrals to needed \nspecialists – meaning the requests were never approved or denied, but just languished, resulting \nin the inmates never seeing specialists.  See supra, pp. 15-16.  This failure was then exacerbated \nby Armor not implementing an alternate plan for appropriate care.  DCB Aff. ¶ 155.  Moreover, \neven if the requests were approved, Armor often failed to schedule off-site specialty services \nwithin the required thirty-day period.  Id. ¶ 156.  Manifestly, these failures – alone and often \ncompounded on top of each other – seriously jeopardize inmates’ health.  This outcome, \nunfortunately, is not merely theoretical: an inmate died in July 2014 after Armor failed to arrange \na requested consultation to a rheumatologist, and the State Medical Review Board determined \nthat had a rheumatologist been seen and treatment received, the death may have been prevented.  \nId. ¶ 161, 162; Ex. 35.   \n  Armor was not entitled to reimbursement in full for services that were not rendered \nconsistent with the standards set out in the contract, and by submitting claims for full \nreimbursement despite its failure to comply with key provisions of the contract, those claims for \nreimbursement were false and fraudulent in violation of State Finance Law § 189(1)(a)-(b).12   \n                                                 \n11 Since the NYAG seeks immediate injunctive relief, it cannot, at this time, quantify the full scope of Armor’s non-\ncompliance with, and under-performance of, its contractual obligations.  Upon information and belief, the fee \ndeduction would equal some $3.7 million extrapolating the fee reduction for the recent two-month sample to the 60-\nmonth course of the Contract.  DCB Aff. ¶ 89. \n \n12 Armor also repeatedly failed self-audits in numerous other service areas, indicating that other reductions were \nlikely triggered and not provided.  DCB Aff. ¶¶ 55-56.  Over five years, Armor ultimately failed seventy audits in \ntwenty-seven subject areas, and each audit failure falls under one of the “performance indicators” for which there is \na contractual financial reduction for failure to meet the benchmark. \n31 \n \n37 of 47\n\n3.  Armor Knowingly Submitted False and Fraudulent Claims for \nPayment  \nThe FCA defines “knowing and knowingly” as meaning: “that a person, with respect to \ninformation: (i) has actual knowledge of the information; (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the \ntruth or falsity of the information; or (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the \ninformation.”  State Finance § 188(3)(a).  The statute goes on to state that there need not be any \nspecific intent to defraud, although acts “acts occurring by mistake or as a result of mere \nnegligence are not covered.” § 188(3)(b). \nHere, there is little question that Armor had actual knowledge that it submitted false \nclaims as that term is defined in the FCA.  Armor (a) rendered the medical services required \nunder the contract, (b) prepared and submitted the claims for payment, and (c) was responsible \nfor monitoring the services provided so it could accurately bill the county.  As such, Armor, as \nthe entity providing medical services and billing for those services, knew it was both not \nperforming and underperforming services required under the contract that form the basis for \npayment and that it was nonetheless submitting claims for payment in full.   \nAs Armor’s actions easily satisfy the definition of “actual knowledge,” Armor also \ncertainly meets the lowest knowledge standard of “reckless disregard.”  In 1986, the federal FCA \nwas amended to create liability based on reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance because this \nexpanded liability would cover “not just those who set out to defraud the government, but also \nthose who ignore obvious warning signs.” UMC Elecs. Co. v. United States, 43 Fed. Cl. 776, 793 \n(1999).  Since 1986, federal courts have consistently defined reckless disregard as an extension \nor aggravated form of gross negligence. United States ex rel. Davis v. District of Columbia, 793 \nF.3d 120, 124 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also United States ex rel. Davis v. Prince, No. 1:08-cv-1244, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77152, at *11 (E.D. Va. Jun. 23, 2011) (“It is intended that persons who \n32 \n \n38 of 47\n\nignore ‘red flags’ that the information may not be accurate or those persons who deliberately \nchoose to remain ignorant of the process through which their company handles a claim should be \nheld liable under the Act.” (quoting Civil False Claims, § 2.06[B], at 291 (quoting H. Rep. No. \n99-660 (June 26, 1986))). “Reckless disregard,” in the context of an FCA cause of action, “was \ndesigned to address the refusal to learn of information which an individual, in the exercise of \nprudent judgment, should have discovered.” United States ex rel. Ervin & Assocs., Inc. v. \nHamilton Sec. Group, Inc., 370 F. Supp. 2d 18, 42 (D.D.C. 2005).  \nAccordingly, poor recordkeeping and a general failure to ensure that bills submitted for \npayment have a factual basis will be considered “reckless disregard.”  See United States v. \nKrizek, 111 F.3d 934, 942 (D.C. Cir 1997) (holding that the District Court properly found that a \npsychiatrist and his wife acted with “reckless disregard” under the FCA when the psychiatrist’s \nwife prepared insurance claims based on assumptions of how much time he spent with patients, \nand the provider himself failed to review the bills submitted on his behalf); see also United States \nv. Raymond & Whitcomb, 53 F. Supp. 2d 436, 447 (S.D.N.Y 1999) (“One who signs a \ncertification cannot choose to remain unaware of the veracity of that certification like the \nproverbial ostrich who buried its head in the sand so as to see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no \nevil.  Thus, a failure to conduct a proper investigation before making a false statement may be \nsufficiently reckless to yield False Claims Act liability.”). \nEven if Armor maintains it did not have actual knowledge that it submitted false and \nfraudulent claims, there can be no question that it acted with “reckless disregard,” as it ignored \n“red flags” concerning its billing practices.  Armor was fully aware (not least through its self-\naudits, when they were performed) of which services it was performing in full, not performing \nand underperforming, while nonetheless failing to perform the quality assessment reporting that \n33 \n \n39 of 47\n\nwould help quantify, and let the County to know, the full extent of its non-performance.  Armor \nalso knew the dollar amount it was billing Nassau County – the full monthly rate, every month. \nArmor’s failure to take the most basic steps to ensure it was accurately billing Nassau County for \nthe services provided each month, despite clear “red flags,” constitutes reckless disregard \nconcerning the accuracy of the claims submitted by Armor for payment.   \nII.  ARMOR ENGAGED IN REPEATED AND PERSISTENT FRAUDULENT \nBUSINESS PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF EXECUTIVE LAW § 63(12)  \n \nThe OAG may bring a claim under Executive Law § 63(12) to enjoin repeated or \npersistent fraud in the “carrying on, conducting or transacting of business.”  Armor engaged in \nsuch fraudulent business practices by (a) misrepresenting the standard of care and services that \nwould be provided to inmates and (b) presenting false and fraudulent claims for payment for \nservices that were not rendered or were inadequately rendered.  These misrepresentations were \nrepeated and persistent.  \nA.  Armor Engaged in Repeated and Persistent Fraudulent Business Practices \nby Misrepresenting the Standard of Care and Provision of Services  \n \nExecutive Law § 63(12) defines the terms “fraud” or “fraudulent” as “any device, scheme \nor artifice to defraud and any deception, misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, false \npretense, false promise or unconscionable contractual provisions.”  Consistent with this language \nand the legislative intent, courts have consistently applied an extremely broad view of what \nconstitutes fraudulent and deceptive conduct under Executive Law § 63(12). See, e.g., Lefkowitz \nv. Bull Inv. Group, Inc., 46 A.D.2d 25, 28 (3d Dep’t 1974), lv denied 35 N.Y.2d 647 (1975) (“It \nis well settled that the definition of fraud under subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive \nLaw is extremely broad and proof of scienter is not necessary.”).  \nCourts have repeatedly held that a prima facie claim of fraud under Executive Law \n34 \n \n40 of 47\n\n§ 63(12) can be established by showing “whether the act complained of has the capacity or \ntendency to deceive.” See, e.g., State v. Applied Card Sys., Inc., 27 A.D. 3d 104 (3d Dep’t \n2005), aff’d on other grounds, 11 N.Y.3d 105 (2008) (internal citations omitted) (citing State v. \nGen. Elec. Co., Inc., 302 A.D.2d 314 (1st Dep’t 2003)).  It is not necessary to establish the \ntraditional elements of common law fraud, such as intent to deceive and reliance, to establish \nliability for fraud under Executive Law § 63(12).  Gen. Elec. Co., 756 N.Y.S.2d at 524; State v. \nFord Motor Co., 136 A.D.2d 154, 158 (3d Dep’t 1988), aff’d, 74 N.Y.2d 495 (1989); State v. \nMerkin, No. 450879/09, 2010 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 523, at *18-19 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2009).   \nIn both its proposal to Nassau County and the contract, Armor represented the various \nservices that it would provide and the quality of those services.  See Exs. 8 and 9.  For example, \nArmor represented in its proposal and in the contract that inmates submitting sick call requests \nwould be seen by licensed nurses within forty-eight to seventy-two hours of receipt of the \nrequest, yet Armor persistently and repeatedly failed to satisfy this obligation.  DCB Aff. ¶ 65; \nEx. 9 at 1.10-1.11; Ex. 8 at 3, §3(a).  Similarly, Armor represented in its proposal and in the \ncontract that it would arrange for specialty services when needed, and yet NCCC inmates were \nrepeatedly unable to access off-site specialty care. See supra, pp. 15-16.  It also made specific \nrepresentations about mental health treatment planning, but two of the four audits conducted \nevidence Armor’s failure to complete such plans. DCB Aff. ¶ 146; Ex. 9 at 1.35; Ex. 8, Attch. 2.   \nArmor’s misrepresentations concerning the standard of care and services it would \nprovide, as represented in the contract and in its proposal in response to NCCC’s Request for \nProposals, constitute fraudulent conduct in violation of Executive Law § 63(12).    \nB.  Armor Engaged in Repeated and Persistent Fraudulent Business Practices \nby Submitting False and Fraudulent Claims for Payment to Nassau County \n  Further, as set forth extensively in Section I, see supra, pp. 23-34, for five years Armor \n35 \n \n41 of 47\n\nrepeatedly and persistently submitted false and fraudulent claims for payment, seeking payment \nbased on false representations concerning its performance of its contractual duties.  Such \nfraudulent business practices are also actionable under Executive Law § 63(12).  See, e.g., \nHogan v. Cuomo, 67 A.D. 3d 1144, 1145 (3d Dep’t 2009) (finding that the NYAG “possesses \nauthority, pursuant to Executive Law § 63 (12) and State Finance Law § 190, to investigate and \nissue subpoenas related to potential fraud or illegality in obtaining public pension benefits.”) \n(emphasis in original). \nIII.  ARMOR ENGAGED IN REPEATED AND PERSISTENT ILLEGAL BUSINESS \nPRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF EXECUTIVE LAW § 63(12)  \nIn addition to authorizing the OAG to enjoin repeated or persistent fraud, Executive Law \n§ 63(12) also authorizes the OAG to enjoin repeated or persistent illegality in the “carrying on, \nconducting or transacting of business.”  Courts have repeatedly found that a violation of a state \nlaw constitutes “illegality” within the meaning of Executive Law § 63(12).  See, e.g., State v. \nPrincess Prestige Co., Inc., 42 N.Y.2d 104, 107 (1977) (violation of Personal Property Law); \nState v. Empyre Inground Pools, Inc., 227 A.D.2d 731, 733 (3d Dep’t 1996) (violations of Lien \nLaw and home improvement contract provisions of General Business Law).  \nThus, Armor’s repeated and persistent violations of the FCA, as set forth in Section I, \nalso constitute a violation of Executive Law § 63(12). \nIV.  EXECUTIVE LAW SECTION 63-C PROVIDES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL \nWITH AUTHORITY TO RECOVER FUNDS MISAPPROPRIATED BY ARMOR \nDUE TO ITS BREACH OF THE CONTRACT \n \n  In the alternative to the FCA and Executive Law § 63(12) causes of action, the Attorney \nGeneral seeks recovery of funds overpaid to Armor pursuant to Executive Law § 63-c, known as \nthe “Tweed Law.”  The statute does not require that the Attorney General identify any \nmisconduct by government officials.  The Tweed Law permits the Attorney General to bring a \n36 \n \n42 of 47\n\ncivil suit against any person who has “obtained” or “disposed of” governmental funds “without \nright.”  Executive Law § 63-c(1).  See State v. Grecco, 21 A.D.3d 470, 474-78 (2d Dep’t 2005).  \nAs explained by the Second Department in Grecco: \n[T]he Tweed Law vests the Attorney-General with the discretionary authority to seek the \nrecovery of money or property (other than real property) belonging to the State or a \nmunicipality, or to recover damages or other compensation for the same, or both, \npursuant to any viable action or proceeding at law or in equity available to the State or \nmunicipality. \n \nId. at 477.  \n  The facts demonstrated on this motion plainly satisfy the elements of Section 63-c, as the \nAttorney General seeks, on behalf of Nassau County, to recover money from Armor based on \nArmor’s failure to perform key elements of the contract, as set forth herein, constituting a partial \nbreach of the contract.  See, e.g., Buchwald v. Waldron, 183 A.D.2d 1080, 1081 (3d Dep’t 1992) \n(upholding lower court’s judgment of partial breach of a home improvement contract where the \ncontractor performed defective work).   \n  As a result of Armor’s breach of contract, Armor without right obtained and received \nmoney held and owned by the County.  As a consequence of the breach, Nassau County suffered \ndamages that include, but are not limited to, financial damages for all payments rendered in \nexchange for services not provided or not substantially performed.   \nV.  THE COURT SHOULD GRANT PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL \nPENALTIES AND COSTS  \nA.  The Court Should Grant Permanent Injunctive Relief Against Armor’s \nIllegal and Fraudulent Conduct \nGiven the significant continued risk to inmates’ health if Armor continues to provide \nsuch grossly inadequate medical services, the NYAG seeks injunctive relief at this time.  The \nNYAG seeks an order: (a) requiring Armor to fully comply with its contractual requirements and \nappointing an external monitor to ensure such compliance, and (b) prohibiting Armor from \n37 \n \n43 of 47\n\nbidding on future contracts to provide jail health services in New York State.  \nIn actions brought pursuant to Executive Law § 63(12), this Court’s remedial powers are \nextremely broad, and courts routinely grant permanent injunctive relief in addition to other forms \nof relief. See State v. Princess Prestige Co., Inc., 42 N.Y.2d 104, 107 (1977); State v. Daro \nChartours, Inc., 72 A.D.2d 872, 873 (3d Dep’t 1979); State v. Scottish-Am. Ass’n, Inc., 52 \nA.D.2d 528, 528-29 (1st Dep’t 1976); State v. Mgmt. Transitions Res., Inc., 454 N.Y.S.2d 513, \n516 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1982); State v. Midland Equities of N.Y., Inc., 458 N.Y.S.2d 126, 129-\n130 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1982).  To ensure Armor complies with the law, the Court should \npermanently enjoin it from providing services inconsistent with the contract terms and appoint an \nexternal independent monitor to oversee compliance, paid by Armor. \nCourts in New York have the ability, in addition to enjoining illegal or fraudulent \npractices, to fashion necessary relief.  See, e.g., State v. Cohen, 473 N.Y.S.2d 98, 101 (Sup. Ct. \nN.Y. Cnty. 1983) (requiring respondent to apply or file notice with the NYAG before filing any \nfurther small claims court actions after a finding that he abused the civil court process).  \n  Appointment of a monitor in this instance is necessary to ensure compliance with the \nCourt’s Final Judgment and is appropriate given the impact on inmates of Armor’s continued \nfailure to comply with its contractual obligations, Armor’s history of knowingly performing its \ncontractual duties inadequately, and the detailed nature of Armor’s legal and contractual \nrequirements.  See United States v. Apple, Inc., No. 12-cv-2826, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129727, \nat *20 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2013) (appointing an external monitor to oversee Apple’s compliance \nwith the Final Judgment and relevant antitrust laws) (subsequent history not included).  Armor \nshould also be enjoined from bidding on any future contracts to provide jail health services in \nNew York.  See, e.g. Cohen, 473 N.Y.S.2d at 54, n.2 (“This court, through both its inherent \n38 \n \n44 of 47\n\npowers and equity, has the discretion and the responsibility to fashion an appropriate remedy.”). \nB.  Armor Should be Ordered to Pay Penalties and Treble Damages for \nViolations of the False Claims Act \nState Finance Law § 189(1)(h) sets out a civil penalty of between $6,000 and $12,000, \nplus three times the amount of damages sustained due to the violator’s actions.  Given the \negregiousness of Armor’s behavior and the dire consequences of Armor’s failure to perform the \nduties for which it nonetheless sought payment, it should be ordered to pay the maximum penalty \nof $12,000 per false claim and treble damages. \nUnder the clear terms of the statute, Armor must pay treble damages simply by virtue of \nhaving violated the FCA.  Armor should also be ordered to pay the maximum civil penalty of \n$12,000 per false and fraudulent claim based on: (1) the nature of the services Armor was \ncontracted to provide – health care services for individuals who are wholly dependent on its care \n– and the impact of its failure to properly provide those services; (2) the five-year scope of \nArmor’s fraudulent claims practices; and (3) Armor’s culpability for having actual knowledge of \nthe false claims.  Each and every monthly claim voucher where Armor: (a) did not provide some \nof the services for which it billed and (b) billed for services rendered inconsistent with the terms \nof the contract is a false and fraudulent claim for which a $12,000 penalty should be assessed.   \nAt the very least, this includes: (a) all claims from the beginning of the contract to the present \nbased on its failure to implement electronic health records; (b) the months where Armor failed to \ndevelop CAPs; (c) the two months Armor grossly failed to timely respond to sick calls, and (d) \nthe approximately 84.5 months Armor left key positions vacant, and the many more months \nArmor understaffed positions by at least 15%.   \nC.  Armor Should be Ordered to Pay Damages for Partial Breach of Contract \n \n  In the alternative to awarding triple damages under the False Claims Act, Armor should \n39 \n \n45 of 47\n\nbe ordered to pay damages resulting from its failure to perform key services under the contract \nfor which NCCC paid in full.  Armor should be ordered to pay restitution of the full amount the \ncounty overpaid for the services it failed to perform consistent with the contract’s requirements.  \nD.  The Court Should Direct an Accounting on Damages \n \n  Upon finding Armor liable, this Court should order an accounting of the damages to \ndetermine Nassau County’s overpayment to Armor as a result of Armor’s non-performance and \nunder-performance of its contractual obligations, including its failure to apply the financial \nreductions triggered by its failure to adequately perform certain services.  While Armor’s \nliability is evident, an accounting is necessary to determine the amount of the county’s \noverpayment due to Armor’s repeated submission of claims for services that it failed to perform \nat all and services that it failed to perform consistent with the contract’s terms.  However, such \nan accounting should not delay NYAG’s request for immediate injunctive relief, which is \nnecessary to protect inmates’ health. \nE.  Armor Should be Ordered to Pay Costs \n  CPLR 8303(a)(6) provides that the court may award the NYAG “a sum not exceeding \ntwo thousand dollars against each defendant” in a special proceeding pursuant to Executive Law \n§ 63(12). Courts have routinely granted these costs. See, e.g., Daro Chartours, Inc., 72 A.D.2d at \n873; State v. Nat’l Home Protection, Inc., No. 400431/09, 2009 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3667, at *17 \n(Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. Dec. 8, 2009); Midland Equities, 458 N.Y.S.2d 126 at 129-30; State v. \nHotel Waldorf-Astoria Corp., 323 N.Y.S.2d 917, 919-20 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1971).  \n  Therefore, an award of additional costs in the amount of $2,000 against Armor should \nalso be granted. \n40 \n \n46 of 47\n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth in this memorandum, the Court should make a summary \ndetermination in Petitioner's favor on all causes of action and grant injunctive relief, damages, \ncivil penalties and costs, as requested in the Verified Petition. \nDated: New York, New York \nJuly 11, 2016 \nRespectfully submitted, \nERIC T.

NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 07/11/2016\nSUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK       \n \nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, \nby ERIC T. SCHNEIDERMAN, Attorney General \nof the State of New York, \n  VERIFIED PETITION  \nPetitioner,   \n  Index No. \n-against-   \n   \nARMOR CORRECTIONAL HEALTH MEDICAL  IAS Part  _______________ \nSERVICES OF NEW YORK, INC. P.C. and ARMOR   \nCORRECTIONAL HEALTH SERVICES OF NEW  Assigned to Justice ____________ \nYORK, INC., \n \nRespondents. \n \n \nPetitioner, the People of the State of New York, by their attorney, Eric T. Schneiderman, \nAttorney General of the State of New York (the “State” or “NYAG”), allege upon information \nand belief: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The NYAG brings this special proceeding against Armor Correctional Health \nMedical Services of New York, Inc. P.C. and Armor Correctional Health Services of New York, \nInc. (together, “Armor” or “Respondent”), pursuant to New York Executive Law  § 63(12) and \nArticle 4 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.  Armor is a physician-owned, for-profit \njail health services provider that was formed in Florida in 2004.  Respondent is contracted to \nprovide jail health services in 29 counties across eight states: Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, \nIllinois, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Virginia and New York. \n1 of 43\n\n2.  In New York, Armor has provided health care services to inmates at the Nassau \nCounty Correctional Center (“NCCC”) since June 2011.  From December 2012 through October \n2015, Armor was also contracted to provide jail health services in Niagara County’s jail.  \n3.  NCCC is run by the Nassau County Sheriff’s Department and houses both pre-\ntrial and sentenced individuals (collectively, “inmates”).  In 2015, NCCC housed an average of \n1,188 inmates. \n4.  Providing appropriate medical treatment is particularly important in the prison \npopulation due to the high incidence of disease.  A February 2015 report issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice found that in 2011-12, approximately 40% of state and federal prisoners \nand jail inmates reported having a current chronic medical condition (such as cancer, high blood \npressure, or asthma), and 14% of jail inmates reported ever having an infectious disease, such as \ntuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, or a sexually-transmitted disease.   \n5.  Jail populations also evidence a high incidence of mental illness – for example, an \nestimated 25% of jail inmates in the New York City correctional system have been diagnosed \nwith some form of mental illness while in jail and the overall burden of mental illness is \napproximately 38%. \n6.  From 2011 through July of 2016, a total of 14 deaths occurred at NCCC and \nNiagara County’s jail.  Of the latest four NCCC inmate deaths, one occurred just days ago in \nJuly (no causal information as yet), one occurred in June (death by suicide) and two occurred in \nMarch 2016 (the cause of each remains under investigation). The New York State Commission \nof Correction's Medical Review Board (\"State Medical Review Board\"), charged with the \noversight of jail and prison health care and the investigation of related morbidity and mortality \n2 \n \n2 of 43\n\nincidents, found egregious lapses in medical care in seven of the 14 deaths, five of which \noccurred at NCCC.  \n7.  The NYAG’s investigation revealed that Armor has not met its contractual \nobligations to Nassau County as evidenced by the following: inadequate self-assessments (or \n“self-audits”) and inadequate continuous quality improvement processes that would ensure \nquality of health care services; deficient sick call procedures; failure to provide access to \nmedications; inadequate diagnostic services; deficient mental health services; inadequate \nreferrals to specialists; failure to maintain (i) its equipment and (ii) accurate and complete \nmedical records; and inadequate staffing. \n8.  The NYAG brings this special proceeding for injunctive relief, damages, civil \npenalties and costs.  Armor has consistently failed to meet its contractual obligations with \nNassau County, which were put in place to provide appropriate medical and mental health \nservices for inmates.  Armor’s many failures appear to have resulted in avoidable harm to \nincarcerated persons at NCCC, who rely on Armor for medical care. \n9.  The deaths in Niagara County when Armor was the health service provider took \nplace on December 25, 2012 (death from hypothermia complicated by hypertensive \ncardiovascular disease, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism; State Medical Review Board found \nthat Armor failed to provide prescribed medication, initiate constant supervision, request records \nfrom community health provider and appropriately diagnose and treat) and on December 29, \n2012 (death from acute untreated pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure; State Medical \nReview Board determined that Armor failed to order a specialty cardiac consult and prescribed \nmedication that was contra-indicated in cardiovascular disease).  \n3 \n \n3 of 43\n\n10.  The deaths in Nassau County took place on June 11, 2011 (death from myocardial \ninfarction; State Medical Review Board  found that “care was grossly incompetent;” “death may \nhave been prevented had [the inmate] received timely and appropriate emergency medical care”);            \nFebruary 24, 2012 (suicide by hanging; State Medical Review Board found that Armor failed to \nprovide adequate psychiatric services and emergency procedures were poorly performed); \nFebruary 10, 2014 (death from cardiac failure due to hypertensive cardiovascular disease; State \nMedical Review Board found that Armor failed to provide adequate medical and psychiatric \ncare); July 14, 2014 (death from cardiorespiratory arrest due to laryngeal edema and angioedema; \nState Medical Review Board determined that Armor failed to provide proper medical treatment); \nand on May 2, 2015 (death from anoxic encephalopathy post cardio-respiratory arrest due to \nacute myocardial infarction; State Medical Review Board found that Armor did not perform an \nadequate admission exam and did not provide critical medications).   \n11.  The records relating to each of these deaths demonstrate an array of deeply \nproblematic practices, including Armor’s failure to: provide timely medical care in response to \ninmate needs; provide adequate medical and psychiatric evaluations; perform diagnostic tests \nand timely dispense needed prescriptions drugs; refer inmates to specialist care where medically \nnecessary; and carry out orders set forth by clinicians.  \n12.  The four deaths of NCCC inmates that occurred in March, June and July 2016, \nwhile still under review, also raise serious concerns about the care being delivered by Armor.   \n13.  The NYAG has an interest in (i) assuring appropriate healthcare to persons who \nare detained in jails within the State of New York, and (ii) protecting the economic interests and \nthe public health of the citizens of Nassau County. \n4 \n \n4 of 43\n\n14.  Armor’s conduct is seriously detrimental to those interests. \n \nJURISDICTION AND PARTIES \n15.  The NYAG brings this special proceeding pursuant to New York Executive Law \n§ 63(12); New York State Finance Law § 189(1)(a) and (b), (3), and § 190 (1) (“NY False \nClaims Act”); and New York Executive Law § 63-c (“Tweed Law”). \n16.  Executive Law § 63(12) empowers the NYAG to seek injunctive relief, \nrestitution, disgorgement and damages when any person or business entity has engaged in \nrepeated fraudulent or illegal acts, or has otherwise demonstrated persistent fraud or illegality in \nthe carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.   \n17.  The NYAG seeks an order and judgment: (a) declaring that Armor’s practices and \nconduct violated NY False Claims Act § 189(1)(a)-(b) and Executive Law § 63(12), or, in the \nalternative, declaring that Armor has converted, disposed of, obtained, and/or received public \nfunds without right, pursuant to Executive Law § 63-c; (b) permanently enjoining and restraining \nArmor from engaging in the illegal and fraudulent practices described herein, (c) appointing an \nindependent monitor to oversee ongoing compliance with the contract, (d) permanently enjoining \nRespondent from bidding for future jail health contracts in New York State, (e) directing that \nArmor, pursuant to the NY False Claims Act § 189 pay: (i) an amount equal to three times the \namount of damages sustained as a result of its violations and (ii) penalties of $12,000 for each \nviolation, or, in the alternative awarding Petitioner the monies that Armor without right obtained \nas a result of its breach of contract; (f) requiring an accounting by Armor to determine the \namount of Nassau County’s damages, and (g) directing Armor to pay costs.  \n5 \n \n5 of 43\n\n18.  Petitioner is the People of the State of New York by their attorney Eric T. \nSchneiderman, Attorney General of the State of New York. \n19.  Armor is a professional corporation organized under the laws of the State of New \nYork, with its principal place of business at 4960 SW 72nd Avenue, Suite 400, Miami, Florida \n33155.1   \n20.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Armor because it transacts business in \nNew York State. \n21.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CPLR § 503.  \nFACTS \nBackground \n22.  In May 2011, following a request for proposal process (“RFP”), Nassau County \nentered into a renewable two-year contract (“Contract”) with Armor to provide health care \nservices to inmates at NCCC.  While the Contract limited contract extensions to two one-year \nrenewals, Nassau County renewed the Contract in May of 2013 for a two-year period, and again \nin May 2015 for an additional two-year period.  The current Contract will expire in May 2017.2  \n23.  The Contract incorporates by reference several documents that set forth detailed \nstandards for how Armor’s services are to be performed including a 2002 settlement agreement \n                                                 \n1        Armor Correctional Health Services of New York, Inc. provided the first bid for the contract, and signed \nthe initial contract.  Armor Correctional Health Medical Services of New York, Inc. P.C., its successor, was \nincorporated in 2014. \n2       In March 2016, some three months after the NYAG commenced its investigation of Armor, Nassau \nCounty issued a new Request for Proposal for a new health service contract for NCCC.  Bids for the contract are due \non August 22, 2016 with selection to take place by October 17, 2016. \n6 \n \n6 of 43\n\nbetween Nassau County and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ Settlement”) that includes \nspecific actions NCCC must take to provide adequate medical care to its inmates. \n24.  The Contract also explicitly incorporates Armor’s response to Nassau County’s \nRFP, dated October 13, 2009, and requires Armor to: provide medical, mental health, substance \nabuse treatment, dental, pharmacy, laboratory and diagnostic services, onsite specialty services \n(including orthopedic, physical therapy, obstetrics and gynecology, optometry, dialysis and \ninfectious diseases); facilitate off-site specialty services and discharge planning; maintain an \ninfirmary; establish a quality improvement program3 overseen by a utilization review committee \nand to adhere to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care standards regarding jail \nhealth.   \n25.   The initial Contract set forth Armor’s annual contract price for the first twelve \nmonths of $10.5 million based on an average daily inmate population of 1,650.  The current \nContract provides for annual compensation to Armor of $11.6 million. \n26.  The Contract may be amended only with “prior written consent of the County \nExecutive or his or her duly designated deputy.”  The Contract further states: “The failure of a \nparty to assert any of its rights under this Agreement, including the right to demand strict \nperformance, shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.” Armor has never provided any \nevidence that any contractual requirements were formally amended for any of the requirements \nat issue in this Petition, except to change certain staffing levels.   \n                                                 \n3    Armor’s quality improvement program was to be developed and implemented in accordance with the DOJ \nSettlement. \n7 \n \n7 of 43\n\n27.  The Contract sets forth that payments are contingent on Armor’s submission of a \nclaim voucher “that (a) states with reasonable specificity the services provided and the payment \nrequested as consideration for such services, (b) certifies that the services rendered and the \npayment requested are in accordance with [the Contract], and (c) is accompanied by \ndocumentation satisfactory to the County supporting the amount claimed.”   \n28.  Each claim voucher contains a certification stating:  \n  I hereby certify that this claim voucher is just, true and correct; that the \namount claimed is actually due and owing and has not been previously \nclaimed . . . I further certify that all items and/or services were delivered or \nrendered as set forth in this claim, and for all items and/or services delivered \nor rendered in accordance with a purchase order or contract that the prices \ncharged are in accordance with the reference purchase order or contract.  For \nall claims made as reimbursement for employee expenses, I further certify that \nthe amounts set forth were actually and necessarily expended for the benefit of \nNassau County . . . \n   \n29.  To support its claim vouchers, Armor is also required to provide Nassau County \nwith monthly reports containing important information about Armor’s provision of care to \ninmates.    \n30.  Armor has submitted the claim vouchers on a monthly basis for one-twelfth of the \nannual Contract price for “medical health services” or “health services,” but without setting forth \nany description of the services provided as the basis for the compensation claimed, and without \nsubmitting supporting documentation to evidence the claimed amount.    \n31.  To support its claim vouchers, the Contract also requires that Armor submit \nmonthly reports measuring the quality and quantity of its provision of care to inmates including \non-site services, intake procedures, outpatient services, and hospitalization services. \n8 \n \n8 of 43\n\n32.  However, while Armor prepared monthly reports, those reports only included \napproximately half of the twenty-four contractually required indicators and did not include key \ncontractually required information, including: (a) the number of inmates who receive health \nscreens at intake and the percentage of inmates who are seen within four hours, (b) the \npercentage of inmates transferred to acute care, and (c) the number of inmates who request \naccess to medical or mental health care through sick call and the percentage who are then seen \nwithin 72 hours of their request.  \n33.  The Contract also sets forth benchmarks for satisfactorily meeting select health \nservices requirements under the contract (called “performance indicators”) (including, for \nexample, adherence to contractual requirements regarding medical and mental health screens; \ntimely access to care, including sick call and medications; diagnostic services; and access to \nspecialists), and financial reductions for failure to meet those benchmarks.  The Contract requires \nthat Armor include any such fee reduction in the subsequent month’s claim voucher, and \npayments to Armor would be adjusted accordingly.  \n34.  No fee reductions have ever been assessed or imposed on Armor, despite Armor’s \nserial failings in meeting contractually required “benchmarks.” \n35.  Despite its vouchers’ certifications, Armor also never reduced the amount owed to \nreflect that its services were not performed consistent with its contractual requirements, \nincluding never providing the contractually-required financial reductions for not adequately \nperforming its obligations under the Contract.  \n36.  Moreover, Armor did not disclose, through any monthly reports sent to Nassau \nCounty or any other written documentation, its underperformance or non-performance of the \n9 \n \n9 of 43\n\ncontractually-required services for each and every month in which adjustments to the fee were \nappropriate. \n37.  The OAG’s investigation revealed that Armor has not met its contractual \nobligations to Nassau County as evidenced by: inadequate auditing and continuous quality \nimprovement processes (including devising and implementing Continuous Quality Improvement \n(“CQI”) corrective action plans) that would ensure quality of health care services; deficient sick \ncall procedures; failure to provide continuous medications; inadequate diagnostic services; \ndeficient mental health services; inadequate referrals to specialists; inadequate staffing; and \nfailure to maintain equipment as well as accurate and complete medical records.  \n  \nArmor Failed To Conduct Quality Improvement Systems \nor Create Corrective Action Plans Consistent With Its  \nContractual Obligations and Representations__________            \n \n38.    An audit system (often called “Quality Assurance”) together with a mechanism \nfor implementation of corrective plans to address deficiencies (often called “Quality \nImprovement”) are key to ensuring the quality of health care delivery in any health care \ninstitution.  \n39.  According to the Contract, Armor is required to perform an array of assessments \nto monitor the quality of care provided to inmates as part of its continuous quality improvement \nprogram. \n40.  Specifically, the Contract requires three types of key periodic assessment reports: \n(1) annual reports; (2) semi-annual reports; and (3) monthly reports.                         . \n10 \n \n10 of 43\n\n41.   These monthly, semi-annual, and annual reviews serve as a basis for evaluating \nand improving the quality of Armor’s services and its compliance with various contractual \nrequirements concerning the provision of health care services.   \n42.  Without the required reports, there is no effective way to gauge the quality of \nhealth care delivery.  \n43.  First, the Contract requires “an annual review of the [Quality Improvement \nProgram] . . . to evaluate the program’s effectiveness.”   \n44.  Notwithstanding the Contract’s requirement, from 2011 through 2015, Armor has \nno record of performing any of the required annual reviews.4 \n45.  Armor is also required to perform annually “at least two process and two \noutcome/quality improvement studies” each year.  A process study examines the effectiveness of \nthe health care delivery system, by investigating systemic problems, such as delayed sick call \nresponses, failure to document behavioral health treatment plans, or failure to refer to specialists.  \nAn outcome/quality improvement study examines whether expected patient outcomes were met \nby analyzing a specific clinical area, such as asthma control, diabetes management or substance \nabuse treatment/detox.   \n46.  Notwithstanding the Contract’s requirements, from 2011 through 2105, Armor \nhas no record of performing these critical studies to assess its services. \n                                                 \n4   “Self-audits” are characterized by service area (such as requests for medical care and outpatient referrals) \nand consist of evaluating various aspects of providing that service in a random sample of approximately ten medical \nrecords to determine if the service was adequately performed.  For example, a mental health audit consists of an \nevaluation of 14 different aspects of providing mental health services, including timely screenings, timely \nconsultations with appropriate staff, development of treatment plans when needed, and proper documentation of that \npatient’s care.  During the audit, an Armor employee reviews the randomly-selected medical records to determine if \neach of the elements comprising the audit were properly performed.   \n11 \n \n11 of 43\n\n47.  Second, the Contract requires Armor to conduct semi-annual operational reviews \nof certain substantive areas including: access to care; sick call; emergency care; off-site care and \nutilization; infirmary care; chronic illness care; mental health; intake or transfer screening; \nspecialty care; infection control and safety; and CQI activities. \n48.  Notwithstanding the Contract’s requirement, and the import of these reviews to \ngauging quality of its provision of services, Armor has no record of conducting these semi-\nannual reviews. \n49.  Third, in addition to the annual and semi-annual reviews, Armor is contractually \nrequired on a monthly basis to perform at least four to five quality assessment reviews (referred \nto herein as “self-audits”) “to ensure continuous monitoring of key indicators at a frequency \ndesigned to comply with accreditation standards.”5 \n50.  Armor’s own records reflect that it conducted far fewer than required monthly \nself-audits, which are critical to continuously monitoring the adequacy of its service delivery. \n51.  From 2011 through 2015, Armor conducted only 137 self-audits instead of the \n240 - 300 required under the Contract -- barely half of the audits required. \n52.  Armor is further obliged to develop a corrective action plan (“CAP”) if self-audit \nquality thresholds of 90% are not met. \n53.  A CAP identifies a problem found in a self-audit and sets out a plan of action to \nremedy the problem, including designating the appropriate staff to be engaged in the problem-\nsolving tasks, monitoring and evaluation processes and the setting out the dates upon which \n                                                 \n5   These monthly self-audits are in addition to the monthly reports that Armor was contractually required to \nprovide to Nassau County.  See supra at ¶ 32. \n12 \n \n12 of 43\n\ndelineated tasks are to be completed.  Corrective action plans are crucial components of any \nhealth care provider’s delivery of quality care. \n54.  Armor is required to design a CAP “within 30 days of the date of documentation \nof the deficiency” that results in a self-audit score below 90%.  \n55.  In addition to conducting self-audits far less frequently than the Contract requires, \nArmor also seriously underperformed in the development of CAPs – the necessary action to \naddress shortcomings found in the self-audits. \n56.  Specifically, from 2011 through 2015, Armor failed 70 of the 137 self-audits \n(51%), with these failures spanning across 27 of the 33 subject areas evaluated.   \n57.  For example, Armor conducted self-audits in the following key health services \nover a five-year period on a very limited basis, with a substantial number of failures in most \ncases:  \n  Sick Call Response       2 self-audits; 1 failure \n  Access to Diagnostic Services            6 self-audits; 4 failures \n  Medication Administration/Access  11 self-audits; 8 failures \n  Referrals to Specialty Care                 5 self-audits; 5 failures \n  Chronic Care Clinic Services   3 self-audits; 2 failures \n  Mental Health Services    4 self-audits; 1 failure \n58.  Importantly, Armor only developed corrective action plans for 26 of the 70 failed \naudits, leaving 44 failed audits in significant health care areas without the required corrective \naction plan to improve the identified deficiency. \n13 \n \n13 of 43\n\n59.  From 2011 to 2015, Armor only provided CAPs in some 37% of the instances \nwhere there were failed audits.  Over 60% of audit failures went “uncorrected.”   \n60.  Thus, Armor, in violation of the contract, took no formal action to resolve \nproblem issues its own staff identified concerning Armor’s provision of medical care.   \n61.  In key service areas, Armor never developed CAPs despite routinely failing most \nof the self-audits performed in those areas.  For example, Armor only developed: \n  no CAP addressing specialty consultation referrals in response to the five \nfailed audits in that category, and  \n \n  one CAP addressing access to diagnostic services despite four self-audit \nfailures.   \n \n62.  Even when CAPs were developed, they were not consistently implemented.   \n63.  While implementation should be documented in the Continuous Quality \nImprovement meeting minutes, these minutes do not reflect that CAPS were regularly \nimplemented and their effectiveness re-evaluated, as required under the Contract.  \n64.    For example, in September 2015, Armor devised its one and only corrective \naction plan to address its failure in performing diagnostic services (despite four self-audit \nfailures).   \n65.  There is no indication in Armor’s records, however, that the plan was \nimplemented or its effectiveness evaluated. \n66.  The Contract sets forth a fee reduction of $100 per day for each CAP not \ncompleted within 45 days from the date of the occurrence.  Given that Armor never developed \ncorrective action plans for some 44 failed self-audits, Armor should have reduced its fees at the \nvery least by $528,000, if not by much more. \n14 \n \n14 of 43\n\n67.  Because (i) Armor failed to consistently conduct CQI audits to assess the medical \nservices provided to inmates and (ii) when Armor did audit, failed to design and implement \nCAPs to remedy health care service problems identified in CQI audits, it should have reduced its \nfees in its payment vouchers to Nassau County as required under the Contract.  \n68.  These failures to address audit deficiencies as well as failure to audit consistently \nin any case, are significant failures in adherence to the Contract, and a disservice to both the \ninmates who bear the consequences of poor health services that are not improved through a \nquality improvement program, as well as the County taxpayers who are not receiving the \nservices required under the Contract. \n \nArmor Failed to Implement a Sick Call System Consistent  \nWith Its Contractual Obligations and Representations \n \n69.  The Contract requires that Armor implement and operate a sick call system \nthrough which patients request and obtain health care treatment.  \n70.  Pursuant to the Contract, the sick call system is required to work as follows: (1) \nthe patient completes a sick call form that may be placed in the sick call box that is located on \neach housing unit or given to the nurse during nurse’s medication rounds, (2) a registered nurse \nthen triages sick calls within 24 hours of pick-up, and (3) one of Armor’s clinicians sees the \npatient within 72 hours of pick-up of the patient’s sick call.6 \n                                                 \n6   The Contract requires that inmates be seen by an Armor clinician within 48 hours from receipt of the sick \ncall slip, and 72 hours when over a weekend.  However, fee reductions are only imposed where the inmate has not \nbeen seen after 72 hours. \n15 \n \n15 of 43\n\n71.  To ensure proper documentation of this sick call process, Armor’s sick call logs \n(“Sick Logs”) are required to include the following information: date and time of inmate’s \nrequest; name of inmate and NCCC identification number; triage date; date seen; and medical \ncomplaint.  Medical charts of each patient would also include a copy of the sick call request and \nshow date that the patient was seen. \n72.  As evidenced by Armor’s own CQI audit records, its Sick Log entries, a \ndecedent’s medical record and testimony of former inmates, Armor’s medical personnel \nfrequently failed to examine patients within 72 hours of a patient’s submitting a sick call request \nform. \n73.  By failing to adhere to the time requirements set out in the Contract, Armor has \nroutinely failed to address the medical needs of inmates. \n74.  Notably, there is no record that Armor ever performed a single semi-annual \nreview to assess its performance of its sick call processes and only performed two self-audits \nover the course of the contract (one of which it failed). \n75.  An analysis by the NYAG of Armor’s January and February 2016 Sick Logs \nreveals that there were, respectively, 2,827 and 2,660 sick call requests, and Armor’s clinicians \nfailed to timely respond to approximately \n  37% of the sick call requests in January 2016, and  \n  28% of the sick call requests in February 2016. \n76.  In some of these cases, inmates filed repeated sick call requests, and Armor \ndelayed weeks before arranging for a clinician visit.   \n16 \n \n16 of 43\n\n77.  Armor’s carelessness added to patients not being seen after making sick call \nrequests.   For example, in January and February of 2016, over 150 of the sick call requests \nwere not attended to because patients’ charts were simply not available.  Moreover, Sick Logs \nevidence other inadequacies including failing to set forth the date on which patients were \nexamined and illegible clinician signatures on the sick call forms. \n78.  In at least one instance in 2015, sick call slips were not picked up for many days \nbecause the key to the collection box was missing. \n79.  Armor’s providers often noted in Armor’s own sick logs that inmates were not \nreceiving timely follow-up care, including, for example:   \n  “Patient requested treatment for painful laceration of face and was not \nseen for three days.” \n   \n  “Patient requested medications on 4/23.  None was given until 4/29 by \nwhich point, patient had numbness.”  \n \n  “Patient requested treatment 4/24 for left side body pain, on 4/27 left side \nof chest pain.  Patient was not seen until 4/30.”  \n \n  “[K.A.] must be seen 6/1/15 per Dr. Marcos.  Since 5/22 inmate placed \nnumerous sick calls trying to obtain treatment.”  (June 1, 2015)  \n \n80.  The failure to address sick call requests goes to the very heart of providing \nadequate medical care. Inmates at NCCC rely on the sick call system to afford them access to \nboth urgent as well as non-urgent health care services. Failing to abide by the time constraints set \nforth in the Contract results in delayed care that can impact inmates to the detriment of their \nhealth.  \n17 \n \n17 of 43\n\n81.  Moreover, while the Sick Logs are to be triaged within 24 hours, there is no \nindication as to the process followed by reviewers to determine the order that inmates are seen \nbased on their complaints. \n82.    Armor’s standard “Sick Call Request” form includes a check-off for the nurse to \nmark “Urgent” or “Referral to HCP [health care provider].”  Examples of inappropriate triaging \nof “Urgent” inmate sick call requests with the potential of dire consequences abound in Armor’s \nown Sick Logs: \n  An inmate submitted a sick call request form on May 22, 2015 stating that \nhis knee was filled with fluid and required drainage. He was seen by a \nhealth provider seven days after submitting his first sick call request, and \nonly after he filed six additional sick call requests. \n  Another inmate suffered from a painful laceration on the right side of his \nface. His sick call request was logged on April 27, 2015. He was seen by a \nclinician three days later.  \n  On yet another occasion, an inmate complained on April 24, 2015 about \npain that spanned the entire left side of his body. Since his first sick call \nrequest went unanswered, he filed a second sick call three days later \nstating that he was then suffering from pain in the side of his chest. Three \ndays after the second sick call request and seven days after the first sick \ncall request, the inmate was finally seen by a clinician. \n  \n  On yet another occasion, an inmate filed a sick call request on June 4, \n2015 stating that he was experiencing increasingly pale and numb fingers. \nThis inmate filed a second sick call request four days later indicating that \nhis gait was then unsteady and his knee was swollen. The inmate was first \nseen by a clinician six days after his first sick call request.  \n \n83.  The consequences of delay in providing care through sick call are evidenced by \ninmate examples. One inmate, J.G., who died in NCCC custody on July 14, 2014, filed a sick \ncall request on June 5, 2014 to obtain medication that he had been taking at home. After no \nArmor medical staff heeded his request, he filed a second sick call request one day later to obtain \n18 \n \n18 of 43\n\nthe medication and also complained of swelling in his arm. He was not examined until six days \nafter filing his first sick call request, when he presented with difficulty breathing and swelling of \nhis shoulder, neck, and throat.7   \n84.  W.H., a former inmate who was incarcerated at NCCC from January 2015 until \nJuly 2015, filed a number of sick call requests over a period of days to obtain the prescription \nmedications for mental health conditions that he was taking before his incarceration at NCCC.  \nHe experienced vomiting, diarrhea, shaking and chills for days before finally receiving the \nmedications nearly a week after his admission to NCCC. \n85.  Another former inmate, J.A., presented to NCCC with a history of cardiac disease \nin July 2012 when he began his incarceration for a period of 16 months.  J.A. filed multiple sick \ncall requests weekly to complain about chest pain and numbness in his arm and hand.  \nUltimately, J.A. was forced to file a lawsuit – over a year after he had been requesting medical \nassistance -- to receive medical attention.  Not long after he filed suit, he was given a stress test, \nthe results of which were so serious that he was taken immediately to Long Island Jewish \nMedical Center for an emergency angioplasty procedure. \n86.  Armor disregarded its contractual obligation to file monthly reports on the \ntimeliness of its sick call responses.  See supra at ¶ 32.  Thus, Armor’s sick call delays have not \nbeen documented and its monthly claims for payments from Nassau County do not properly \nreflect that sick calls were not timely handled as required under the Contract.   \n                                                 \n7        J.G. was at that point referred to a rheumatologist but the referral visit was never made.  J.G. died on July 14, \n2014 as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest that the State Medical Review Board determined was due to swelling of \nhis airway.  \n19 \n \n19 of 43\n\n87.  Further, Armor is required to conduct semi-annual reviews to assess the quality of \nhealth care services it provides at NCCC.  Responding to sick calls in a timely manner is one of \nthe key service categories requiring consistent review.  Armor has no record of conducting these \nsemi-annual reviews. \n88.  Additionally, as noted supra at ¶ 57, Armor failed to continuously monitor its sick \ncall processes through monthly self-audits, having conducted only two sick call self-audits since \nthe inception of the contract in June 2011. \n89.  Each Sick Log violation (where a clinician does not see an inmate within 72 hours \nof a sick call) subjects Armor to a $50 fee reduction under the Contract.   \n90.  No penalties for Sick Log violations have been documented in the monthly \nvouchers from Armor to Nassau County.  Based on the NYAG’s analysis of the January and \nFebruary 2016 Sick Logs, Armor should have been assessed a deduction of at least $123,450, \njust for the months of January and February 2016 alone.    \n91.  Upon information and belief, the fee deduction would equal some $3.7 million \nextrapolating the fee reduction for the recent two-month sample to the 60-month course of the \nContract. \n92.   In sum, Armor has failed to provide an adequate sick call system in violation of \nthe Contract. \n \n \n \n \n \nArmor Failed to Provide Inmates Access to Medications and  \nDiagnostic Services Consistent with Its Contractual  \n20 \n \n20 of 43\n\nObligations and Representations_______________________ \n \nA.  Inmate Access to Medications \n93.  Given that jails house a large percentage of inmates with health problems, both \nchronic and acute, jail health service providers must ensure timely access to medications, as well \nas diagnostic services to discern inmate health issues and make a treatment plan to address issues \nthat have been diagnosed.   \n94.  The Contract requires Armor to maintain a stock of approved medications and \narrange for a back-up pharmacy so that new medication orders are timely administered to \ninmates.  Medications are to be given in a timely, continuous and clinically appropriate manner \nso as to maintain therapeutic treatment levels and avoid adverse consequences to inmates’ health.  \nSpecifically, the Contract requires that inmates receive medication within 24 hours of the written \nprescription. \n95.  Armor is subject to a $50 fee reduction for every inmate delay.   \n96.  Upon admission to NCCC, inmates are to be assessed by a registered nurse who \nobtains the inmate’s medical history, including medications, performs a mental health screen, \nobtains vital signs, such as blood pressure, and orders laboratory tests, such as drug screens and \nurinalysis and administers a test for tuberculosis.  If the inmate presents with a history of having \na medical illness, such as diabetes or hypertension, the inmate is to be examined by an Armor \nclinician within seven days of admission.  If the nurse’s admission assessment of the inmate is \nunremarkable, the inmate is not seen by a clinician.  If an inmate is in jail for two years without \nany medical complaints, that inmate would not see a clinician and would only be examined by a \nnurse for annual health assessments.   \n21 \n \n21 of 43\n\n97.  Contrary to its contractual obligations, Armor’s own audits reveal significant \nproblems in inmates’ access to medication.  Of 11 medication audits over the course of five \nyears, eight, or 73%, failed.   \n98.  In addition, the records of inmates who died at NCCC together with the \nstatements of former inmates attesting to substandard treatment by Armor clinicians, demonstrate \nthat inmates with chronic illnesses did not receive even the most rudimentary care: they were not \nexamined in a timely manner by a clinician, did not receive necessary medications, and did not \nreceive prescribed laboratory examinations as ordered.   \n99.  For example, decedent A.M. was incarcerated at NCCC on April 24, 2015 with a \nhistory of drug and alcohol abuse, asthma, and a herniated disc. According to a nurse’s “Health \nAssessment” notes, A.M. presented with a productive cough and reported that he was taking \nProventil and albuterol.  A full admission examination was never performed, however, by a \nclinician. \n100.   Armor’s clinician wrote orders for A.M. to receive albuterol, Qvar, and \nLevaquin, and a chest X-ray. Notwithstanding these orders, A.M.’s medical chart does not \nevidence that A.M. received the medications as prescribed (since the required medication \nadministration record was not contained in A.M.’s chart), or that a chest X-ray was ever \nperformed.   \n101.  As confirmed by the State Medical Review Board findings, Armor did not \nperform an adequate admission exam on A.M. and did not provide him with critical medications. \n102.  In another example of inadequate care, decedent W.S. was incarcerated at NCCC \non March 17, 2016 with a history of hypertension for which he was taking Amlodipine daily. His \n22 \n \n22 of 43\n\nmedication administration record indicates that W.S. did not receive any medication until on or \nabout March 20, 2016. The admitting nurse administered a test for tuberculosis.  On March 20, \n2016, the inmate was unresponsive to verbal stimuli; a blood pressure reading could not be \nobtained and his respirations were noted as shallow.   \n103.  The Armor clinician called 911, but for reasons not explained in W.S.’s medical \nrecord, the inmate was not transferred to the hospital but was instead placed in the NCCC \ninfirmary.  A urinalysis screen and blood work performed on March 21, 2016 indicated that the \ninmate was diabetic, and he was placed on insulin on that day.  W.G.’s EKG, performed on \nMarch 21, 2016, read as “abnormal.” The medical record progress notes, dated March 22 and \nMarch 23, 2016, are illegible as is the signature of the clinician.   \n104.  On March 23, 2016, W.S. was again found in an unresponsive state and \ntransferred to Nassau University Medical Center where he died a day later on March 24, 2016.  \nHis death was attributed to cardio-pulmonary arrest.   \n105.  Evidencing Armor’s failure to provide inmates with required diagnostic services, \nsee infra, there is no indication that a routine urinalysis screen was performed at the time W.S. \nwas admitted to NCCC as required under the Service Contract.  A urinalysis screen at the time of \nintake would have likely revealed that the inmate was diabetic and should have prompted a more \nthorough physical examination with diagnostic laboratory tests.   \n106.  Because of Armor’s failure to conduct an appropriate health assessment at the \ntime of admission, W.S.’s diabetes could have been – but was not – uncovered until five days \nlater, when he experienced an adverse medical event.  Thus, Armor’s failure to appropriately \nscreen W.S. resulted in the delay of his treatment for diabetes. \n23 \n \n23 of 43\n\n107.   Former inmates describe Armor’s denials of necessary medication.  For example, \nArmor failed to provide former inmate W.H. the medications he was regularly taking prior to his \ndetention in January 2015 (even where he brought all of his prescription bottles).   At about the \neighth day following his admission to NCCC, Armor’s medical director at NCCC, Dr. Morcos, \ntold him that he had been prescribed too many medications by his community providers and \nwould not be getting the same medications while at NCCC.  \n108.  W.H. also reported an incident in March 2015 when he fell after showering and \nlost consciousness.  He sustained a cracked tooth, cuts on his head and forearm and complained \nof headache, ear pain and sensitivity to light.  The Armor physician refused to send him to the \nhospital.  He was instead placed in the infirmary for observation overnight where he threw up \nthree times.  The following day he was sent to NUMC where he was diagnosed with having a \nconcussion caused by syncope.8  NUMC prescribed vitamin D, folic acid, thiamine, a \nmultivitamin, Tylenol, Effexor XR and Zocor for W.H.  However, Dr. Morcos told W.H. that he \nwould only receive the multivitamin, telling him “just because it is written on the hospital \ndischarge doesn’t mean that you will get it.”   \n109.  County of Nassau Criminal Court, Honorable Jerald S. Carter, has made findings \non the record that Armor does not provide necessary medications to inmates.  In one case, he \nattached to the defendant’s commitment order her medical condition and the list of her \n                                                 \n8    Syncope “is defined as a short loss of consciousness and muscle strength, characterized by a fast onset, \nshort duration and spontaneous recovery.  It is due to a decrease in blood flow to the entire brain usually from low \nblood pressure.”  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_%28medicine%29 \n \n24 \n \n24 of 43\n\nprescriptions and requested that the prosecutor and defense counsel monitor defendant’s medical \ncare at NCCC.   \n110.   In another matter before Judge Carter, the Judge called for an Article 78 with an \nOrder to Show Cause as necessary to determine the reason for Armor’s decision to withhold anti-\npsychotic medication from a twenty-one year old inmate who had been taking since the age of \neight.  For over a year, Armor had withheld the medication from the inmate.  \n  B.  Inmate Access to Diagnostic Services \n111.  Also pursuant to the Contract, Armor is required to perform X-ray, laboratory, \nultrasound, peak flow respiratory and EKG services on-site as needed.  Critical findings are to be \nreported to clinicians within three hours and non-critical results are to be reported to clinicians \nwithin five days and documented in inmate’s medical record.  \n112.  The Contract requires that Armor provide lab services and radiology services on-\nsite whenever possible and “provide as many of these diagnostic and treatment services on-site \nas possible.” \n113.  Armor’s own self-audits of its provision of laboratory and X-ray services, \ncompleted only six times over a five-year period, demonstrate that Armor did not provide these \ndiagnostic services in an effective and timely manner: Armor failed four of the six self-audits \n(67%).  \n114.  And while Armor was contractually required to create corrective action plans for \neach self-audit failure, Armor failed to do so for three out of four self-audit failures. \n25 \n \n25 of 43\n\n115.   In September 2015, Armor devised one corrective action plan (“CAP”) to address \nits failures in performing diagnostic services.  However, there is no indication that the plan was \nimplemented or its effectiveness evaluated.   \n116.  Notwithstanding its failure to create corrective action plans for the six self-audits \n(or for its failure to implement its sole 2015 corrective action), Armor did not reduce its fees as \nrequired by the Contract.  \n117.  One of Armor’s self-audits of diagnostic services showed that in 67% of the \nsampled cases, Armor failed to document in the medical record the time and date that a \nlaboratory test or X-ray was obtained.  This information is necessary to ensure that lab results are \ntimely retrieved and reviewed, and next steps are taken. \n118.  Even where documentation evidences the lab tests were performed, Armor has \nfailed to collect laboratory specimens within 72 hours of being ordered by a clinician.  The \nfailure to collect a specimen within the proper timeframe may result in the delay of necessary \ncare. \n119.  Similarly, audit records show that Armor has failed to consistently ensure that the \nlaboratory and/or X-ray services performed matches those ordered by the clinician.   \n120.  And in some instances, the test ordered by an Armor clinician was never \nperformed.  For example, the medical record of decedent A.M., an inmate who presented with a \nhistory of a respiratory ailment (see supra at ¶ ¶99-100), shows that Armor’s clinician ordered an \nX-ray but the X-ray was never performed.  The State Medical Review Board noted A.M.’s \nsymptomatic underlying respiratory condition in citing Armor’s failure to perform a “crucial \ndiagnostic exam [X-ray].” \n26 \n \n26 of 43\n\n \n \n \n \n \nArmor Failed to Provide Mental Health Services  \nConsistent With Its Contractual Obligations and Representations  \n \n121.  Armor failed to provide mental health services as required under the Contract by \nfailing to monitor quality through a continuous quality improvement (“CQI”) process, including \nconsistent auditing and corrective action plans (“CAPs”) where required, by failing to develop \nand implement treatment plans for inmates with mental illness, and by failing to staff its mental \nhealth section adequately.   \n122.   There is no record Armor ever performed a semi-annual review to assess its \nprovision of mental health services, and over the five-year course of its Contract, Armor \nconducted only four mental health audits and conducted no mental health audits in 2013 and \n2015.   \n123.    Two of the four audits document Armor’s failure to complete mental health \ntreatment plans for inmates receiving mental health services.   \n124.  The Contract, through its incorporation of Nassau County’s settlement with the \nU.S. Department of Justice, specifically requires the development and implementation of \ntreatment plans for inmates with special needs, including inmates with mental illness.  \n125.  Armor is also required, for inmates on continuous supervision related to their \nmental health, to have “contemporaneous treatment plan(s) reflecting the patients’ continuous \nsupervision status, the intervention(s) and the reason for placement on and/or \ncontinuation/discontinuation of continuous supervision.”  \n27 \n \n27 of 43\n\n126.  In its bid for the NCCC contract (incorporated into the Contract), Armor \nrepeatedly represented that it would provide treatment planning to guide mental health treatment \nand care.  For example, the bid states: “Armor develops an initial Treatment Plan during the \nmental health evaluation. The plan will follow Armor's guidelines and will be reviewed regularly \nby a multi-disciplinary team.” Further, one of the “key components” of its mental \nhealth/behavioral service program is “Multidisciplinary Treatment Plans.”  \n127.  Importantly, mental health treatment plans typically detail inmates’ problems, \ntherapeutic interventions, including timing of such interventions and persons who will be \nresponsible for carrying out such interventions.  \n128.  Notably, Armor’s own clinicians have noted on Sick Logs Armor’s failure to \nappropriately refer inmates for mental health evaluations.  \n129.  Importantly, the medical records of two NCCC decedents who were both under \nArmor’s care, B.R. and K.B., evidence that Armor’s mental health assessments and planning \nwere inadequate.  The inadequacies were confirmed by the State Medical Review Board, which \nfound that in each of these cases, Armor provided substandard mental health care. \n130.   Both B.R. and K.B. presented at NCCC with histories of mental illness, and one, \nK.B., exhibited clear signs of mental instability.   \n131.  Despite psychiatric initial assessment where clinicians observed a clear need for \npsychiatric care, in neither case were psychiatric follow-ups planned.  \n132.  B.R. was an Iraq war veteran with a history of post-traumatic stress disorder, bi-\npolar disorder and opioid abuse.  K.B. presented with a history of traumatic brain syndrome and \nwas observed to be actively hallucinating at the time of his admission to NCCC.  However, \n28 \n \n28 of 43\n\nArmor’s psychiatrist overlooked or otherwise neglected to document the presenting mental \nhealth histories of B.R. and K.B.  \n133.  In B.R.’s case, a licensed practical nurse conducted an initial screen and noted \nB.R.’s flat affect, and Armor placed B.R. accordingly in mental health housing to be seen \nurgently by a psychiatrist. B.R.’s health assessment was conducted by a registered nurse who \nalso noted that a referral for behavioral health was indicated. On February 24, 2012, the day \nfollowing his incarceration at NCCC, B.R. was seen by a psychiatrist whose sparsely written \ndocumentation did not mention B.R.’s substantial mental health history, noting only B.R’s \nhistory of opioid use. The psychiatrist discontinued B.R.’s mental health housing and specifically \nassessed that he had no need for mental health treatment. The psychiatrist referred B.R. to \nbehavioral health for opiate withdrawal. Within hours of being seen by the psychiatrist and \nremoved from mental health housing, B.R. committed suicide – by hanging – in his cell.   \n134.   The State Medical Review Board determined that patient’s psychiatric \nexamination was inadequate in light of B.R.’s history of PTSD, Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety \nDisorder.   \n135.  K.B. was seen by Armor’s psychiatrist on the date K.B. was incarcerated, and the \npsychiatrist ordered K.B. to be removed from constant supervision, noting that K.B. was to be \nfollowed by a mental health counselor in accordance with the “post constant supervision” \nprotocol.  \n136.  The psychiatric note evidencing the examination contained no details regarding \nK.B.’s significant psychiatric history. Instead, the note was limited to the assessment of K.B.’s \nimmediate presentation at time of evaluation. \n29 \n \n29 of 43\n\n137.  On January 27, 2014, a corrections officer (“CO”) noted that K.B.’s behavior had \ndeteriorated and that he was confrontational. The CO noted that he referred K.B. to the mental \nhealth unit in lieu of instituting disciplinary action. A plan for mental health counseling was \nrequested the next day, February 3, 2014.   K.B. was then seen by a psychiatrist who drafted a \nsparse and illegible note ordering that K.B. be kept on constant supervision. The psychiatrist \nnoted that psychiatric medications, however, were not indicated at that time.   \n138.  The Armor records show that K.B. had other medical needs: K.B. reported at \nintake that he had a history of hypertension. However, K.B.’s medical record does not reflect that \nhe was referred to the chronic care clinic for follow-up of his hypertension. K.B. was found dead \nin his cell on February 10, 2014. According to the State Medical Review Board, the cause of \ndeath was cardiac failure due to hypertensive cardiovascular disease. \n139.  As set forth above, the State Medical Review Board found that in each of these \ncases, Armor provided inadequate psychiatric care.   \n140.  Finally, Armor failed to fill contractually required clinical staff positions in the \nmental health section (see infra at ¶¶ 176-77 showing that inter alia, the Mental Health Clinical \nCoordinator position was vacant for approximately 19 months and the Mental Health Psychiatric \nAdvanced RNP/PA position was vacant for over a year, then understaffed from 2014 through \n2015).  Inadequate staffing leads to a decrease in services overall as well as the quality of those \nservices.   \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \n30 of 43\n\nArmor Failed to Refer Inmates to Specialist  \nCare Consistent With Its Contractual Obligations and Representations  \n \n141.  The Contract requires that Armor provide certain specialty services on-site \n(orthopedic, physical therapy, optometry, dialysis and infectious disease), and for those inmates \nwhose medical needs are not able to be addressed by Armor’s on-site resources, that Armor will \nrefer inmates for off-site specialist consultation and care.   \n142.  When requests from inmates to Armor for off-site specialty care are “deferred,” \nthe requesting provider must “then outline[] an alternative plan of care or submit[] further \ninformation,” and the inmate will be reevaluated within thirty days.   \n143.  As reflected in the medical records of medically compromised inmates who have \ndied at NCCC, testimony of a former inmate and Armor’s own CQI audit reports, Armor failed \nto properly refer and follow-up on inmates for whom off-site specialist care was medically \nindicated by Armor’s own clinicians at NCCC. \n144.  Armor’s CQI audits reflect that requests for specialty consultation services were \nsubject to its own “utilization review” at Armor’s Florida headquarters and even when Armor’s \nown clinicians’ referrals to specialists were supported with documentation, Armor frequently \nsimply failed to render a utilization decision to deny or approve the specialty referral request.  \nArmor’s inaction effectively resulted in the inmate not seeing a specialist, where even the Armor \nclinician has recommended it. \n145.  Moreover, when such referrals were deferred, Armor did not reliably plan and \nimplement an alternate plan for follow-up care. \n31 \n \n31 of 43\n\n146.  In the case of decedent J.G., see supra ¶ 83, the Armor clinician referred the \ninmate to rheumatology for his intermittent swellings (including throat swelling), but Armor \nnever arranged for the rheumatology consultation to the detriment of J.G.  The State Medical \nReview Board determined that had J.G. been seen by the rheumatologist and received a correct \ndiagnosis and medical treatment, his death may have been prevented. \n147.  Decedent S.L., who was detained at NCCC on October 3, 2015 until his death on \nMarch 7, 2016, filed frequent sick call requests throughout his incarceration relating to pain in \nassociation with his non-reducible inguinal hernia.  In October 2015, Armor’s Medical Director \ndenied Armor’s health care provider’s request that an inmate be sent off-site for a surgical \nevaluation because the hernia was non-reducible. Whenever he presented with a complaint about \nhis hernia, the Armor clinician noted that the surgical consult was deferred.  The inmate was \nfound unresponsive in his cell on March 7, 2016. \n148.  But even when specialty referral requests were approved, Armor did not always \nschedule such off-site specialty services within 30 days of the approval as required under the \nContract, delaying needed care and jeopardizing health of inmates. \n149.  And where an inmate was successfully referred to a specialist, in many instances, \nArmor failed to (i) review the off-site specialists’ recommendations and (ii) establish a plan of \npatient care based on the specialists’ directives.  \n150.  Armor’s CQI audits reflect a consistent pattern of inappropriate and failed \npractices relating to off-site specialty referrals.  Such failures are noted in Armor’s CQI audits \nfrom September 2011 through September 2015. \n32 \n \n32 of 43\n\n151.    Notwithstanding these deficiencies, Armor developed only one corrective action \nplan, in December 2015, not in response to a self-audit, but upon finding that an inmate’s referral \nto an off-site specialist was delayed because there was no follow-up on the utilization manager’s \nrequest for supporting documentation.  Armor determined that there was no process in place to \nhandle consult requests that were incomplete or pending information.   \n153.  In this case, a patient with a complex fracture of the jaw saw an Armor health care \nprovider who recommended that he be seen for follow-up in two days. However, the inmate was \nseen nine days later and only after he generated a sick call request.  On re-examination by an \nArmor health care provider, an off-site consult for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery evaluation \nwas requested and approved.  However, the appointment was never made for him to be seen by \nthe off-site specialist. \n154.  Following this incident and its development of an appropriate CAP, Armor \noutlined a process to log and follow-up on requests for off-site specialists.    \n155.  Moreover, from September 2011 through September 2015, Armor has only \nperformed five self-audits and there is no evidence it performed a single semi-annual review \nconcerning access to specialty care. \n156.  Consistent with the narratives of former inmates, Armor’s self-audits reflect a \nconsistent pattern of inappropriate and failed practices relating to off-site specialty referrals, \ndemonstrating non-compliance with the contract: over the course of the contract, Armor has \nfailed all five of its self-audits in this area.  There is no documentation that CAPs were developed \nand implemented as required under the Contract. \n33 \n \n33 of 43\n\n157.  The NCCC houses inmates who have chronic illnesses and other health issues that \nmay require a specialist’s assessment and care.  In violation of its Contract, Armor has not \nadequately referred and followed through in referring inmates who require off-site specialty \nservices to those medically necessary services.   \n \n \n \nArmor Failed to Create and Maintain Medical Records  \nConsistent With Its Contractual Obligations and Representations \n \n158.  Under the Contract, Armor is required to properly create and maintain \ncomprehensive medical records for each inmate.  Such medical records are to include current \nnotes from all health care providers, including medication administration records and diagnostic \nreports.   \n159.  The Contract also includes the requirement that Armor install an electronic record \nsystem that would reduce the probability of error, eliminate legibility issues, and have easily-\naccessible data, in addition to a host of other benefits.  The cost for this service is included in the \nCounty’s monthly payment:  for the first year of the Contract, electronic health record \nimplementation was to cost some $78,668, while for the second year, the cost to the County as \npart of the Contract was $81,056. \n160.  An electronic health record system was never implemented, but there has been no \ndeduction for the related costs of the system.   \n161.  Medical records should accurately document inmates’ histories, medical \nassessments and progress relating to care in an organized and chronological manner to enable \ninmate’s needs to be assessed accurately and treated effectively.   \n34 \n \n34 of 43\n\n162.  Poor record-keeping can result in adverse patient care whereby, for example, \nmedications are duplicated or missed and signs or changes in patients’ conditions are neglected. \n163.  In violation of its obligations under the Service Contract and to the detriment of \ninmates, Armor failed to maintain (i) complete and legible medical charts for all inmates, and (ii) \naccurate Sick Logs (see supra at ¶ 69).  \n164.  Indeed, as noted supra at ¶ 77, many Sick Logs document that medical records \nwere not available at the times patients were to be seen.  The sample of sick logs from two \nmonths in 2016, found that over 100 sick call requests were simply not available at the times that \ninmates were to be seen, making continuity of care, or any care, much more difficult and \npotentially dangerous, given no written record of previous care.  \n165.  Additionally, Sick Logs evidence other inadequacies; including failing to set forth \nthe date on which patients were examined and illegible clinician signatures on the sick call \nforms.  \n166.  Inmate charts similarly exemplify these shortcomings.  For example, both the \ncharts of W.S. and J.G. contain illegible entries and purported signatures (but no stamps) of \nhealth care providers such that subsequent treating clinicians would not be able to read the \nmedical history nor know the clinician who had treated the inmate. \n167.  Relatedly, the position of medical records director was understaffed, and at times \nvacant, from July 2013 through mid-May 2015.  \n168.  The State Medical Review Board has also noted Armor’s disorganized, illegible \nand improperly signed medical records. \n \n35 \n \n35 of 43\n\nArmor’s Failed To Maintain Medical Equipment  \nConsistent With Its Contractual Obligations and Representations \n \n169.  NCCHC standards require “at a minimum” certain equipment for the examination \nand treatment of patients, including an automated external defibrillator, and that such emergency \nequipment are available and checked regularly. \n170.  Notwithstanding the import of functioning equipment, Armor conducted only one \nequipment audit from 2011 through 2015 and there is no record that it ever performed any semi-\nannual reviews in this area. \n171.  In its sole self-audit of equipment, in September 2015, its self-audit revealed that \nArmor failed to check its AED defibrillator as recommended by the manufacturer and, \nsignificantly, failed to check the emergency crash cart every shift.   \n172.  The minutes of Armor’s CQI November 24, 2015 meeting reflect that Armor \nscored a passing grade of 94% on its Equipment self-audit while noting the failed AED and crash \ncart areas.  It was also noted that the documentation of the checks was missing.   \n173.  Despite these critical failings with respect to emergency equipment, Armor did \nnot devise nor implement a corrective action plan. \n \nArmor Failed To Staff NCCC Consistent \nWith Its Contractual Obligations and Representations  \n \n174.  The contract sets forth jail staffing requirements, including specific positions that \nmust be provided and the number of full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees that must be staffed \nin those positions.  \n36 \n \n36 of 43\n\n175.  Armor’s staffing records for the period covering June 2011 to November 2015 \nshow that Armor did not fulfill its staffing obligations under the contract, even for clinicians and \nthe most senior management positions.   \n176.  Armor left key positions vacant for significant periods of time, thereby failing to \nmeet its contractual staffing obligations for the indicated months, including: \n  Director of Nursing: The contract requires one FTE in this position, which is responsible \nfor guiding and directing the nursing staff, including ensuring that relevant policies and \nprocedures are current and properly followed, yet it was vacant from June 2012 through \npart of February 2013 (7.5 months); \n  Mental Health Clinical Coordinator: The contract requires one FTE in this position, \nwhich is responsible for coordinating mental health services, yet it was vacant from April \n2014 through November 2015 (19 months);  \n  Psychiatric Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant (“ARNP/PA”): \nThe contract requires .6 FTEs in this position, which is part of the mental health \ntreatment team, yet it was vacant for over one year, from June 2013 through November \n2014 (16 months); \n  Utilization manager: The contract requires at least one FTE for this position, which is \nresponsible for managing patients’ access to off-site and on-site specialty care, yet it was \nvacant from June 2013 through November 2015 (2.5 years);  \n  Continuous Quality Improvement and Nurse Educator: The contract requires at least one \nFTE in this position, which has many responsibilities relating to nurse education and the \n37 \n \n37 of 43\n\ncontinuous quality improvement program, yet it was vacant from November 2014 \nthrough November 2015 (1 year). \n177.  Nassau County’s estimated overpayment for these vacancies is $484,795.  In \naddition to the above-listed vacancies, Armor also understaffed other important positions, \nproviding fewer FTEs than contractually required, including: \n  Masters-level Mental Health Professionals: Armor was contracted to provide 4.8 masters-\nlevel MHPs, but in the 2014-2015 contract year, it understaffed that position every month \nout of the year, staffing this position at 84.64% of the required FTEs for that year; \n  Psychiatric ARNP/PAs: Armor was required to provide .6 psychiatric ARNP/PAs, and \nyet, in addition to leaving the position vacant for over a year, it then understaffed the \nposition from November 2014 through November 2015, with an average percent staffed \nfor the 2014-2015 contract year of 31.31% and an average of 50% for June 2015 through \nNovember 2015; and \n  Medical Records Director:  Armor was required to staff one FTE for the position of \nmedical records director, yet this position was understaffed, and at times vacant, from \nJuly 2013 through mid-May 2015, with an average staffing percentages of just 32.43% \nand 39.11% for the 2013 – 2014 and 2014 – 2015 contract years, respectively. \n178.  Moreover, since the staffing levels are established to ensure adequate care for \nthe persons housed in the jail, Armor’s inadequacies demonstrate its lack of adherence to the \nContract. \n \n \n \n38 \n \n38 of 43\n\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  \nVIOLATIONS OF NY FALSE CLAIMS ACT §§ 189(1)(a) and (b) \n179.
